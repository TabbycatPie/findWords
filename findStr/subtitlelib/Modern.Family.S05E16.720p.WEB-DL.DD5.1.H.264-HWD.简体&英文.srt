没错  好激动
It certainly is. So exciting.

14
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,280
什么都比不上开始一个新工作
Nothing like starting a new job.

15
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,160
或是终于能在已有的工作中充分施展才能

新事物带来的美好承诺

20
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,670
我刚接受了一份在CFJ的工作

21
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,330
也就是司法中心

24
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,350
没有啦  算是吧
No, it -- it kind of is.

25
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,600
那是我在法学院的一个朋友
It's a legal-aid society

26
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,750
建立的一所司法救援团体
founded by a law-school friend of mine.

27
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,110
我将成为人民的律师
I will be an advocate for the people,

28
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,380
为无法发言的人发言
a voice for the voiceless.

29
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,000
一样重要的是
And just as important...

30
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,790
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

31
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,650
今晚  我将主持"春季叮当嘉年华"
Tonight, I am chaperoning the Spring-A-Ding-Fling,

32
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,250
筹款  舞会
a fundraiser, a dance,

33
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,480
在我的带领下
which, under my stewardship,

34
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,600
已经打破了学校记录
has shattered school records.

35
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,540
我还加了"叮当"
And I added the "A-ding."

36
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,080
以前一般就叫春季嘉年华
It used to just be called the Spring Fling.

37
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,380
我应该先说我的事情
I should have said my thing first.

38
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,660
各位
Hey, guys.

39
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,530
我今晚开场穿这身  说实话
For my opening number tonight -- be honest.

40
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,110
能看出来我在下面穿了别的吗
Does it look like I have anything on under this?

41
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,120
今晚就是SCARB之夜
Tonight is the SCARB.

42
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,680

这是南加州房地产经纪人的盛会
It is the banquet for southern California realtors.

44
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,970
说真的  唯一的盛会

45
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,440

三次
Three-time.

47
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,870
三次宴会  史上唯一一人
three-time host in the history of the event.

48
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,040
不幸的是  我今年无法参加了
Unfortunately, I have to miss it this year.

49
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,830
这样也好
It's for the best.

50
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,150
她在这种场合总是被无视
She's invisible at these things.

51
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,340
嫁给大明星就是这么不容易
It's tough being married to the rock star.

52
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,300
幸运的是  我另找了一个伴侣
Luckily, I lined up a substitute date.

53
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,840
老爸  你还没睡
Dad. You're still up.

54
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,980
是啊  还在想宴会上要讲的段子
Yeah, just working on some jokes for the banquet.

55
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,380
你跟我一起去怎么样
Hey, how'd you like to come with me?

56
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,230
当然好了
I would love to!

57
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,420
她会答应我毫不意外
Not surprised she said yes.

58
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,780
那丫头天生懂房产
That girl's got real estate in her blood.

59
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,910
她小时候常常跟着我
She used to come with me to open houses

60
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,390
去带客户看房
when she was little.

61
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,320
我们甚至还谈过
We may have even talked about

62
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,340
父女档一起合作呢
a father/daughter partnership.

63
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,010
是啊  她最近有些偏离正轨
Yeah, she's been drifting a little lately,

64
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,980
但让她感受一下
but I think a taste

65
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,390
地区房地产经纪人的魅力之夜
of regional real-estate's most glamorous night

66
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,920
也许能重新燃起她的激情
might just re-ignite that flame.

67
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,470
难以置信我居然得去参加这种宴会
I can't believe I have to go to this thing.

68
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,980
但我有什么选择呢
But what choice did I have?

69
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,790
我当然愿意
I would love to!

70
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,220
但你不会吃饼干不配牛奶吧
But you're not gonna have those cookies without milk, right?

71
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,380
对噢
Right.

72
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,040
不给力啊  菲尔
Come on, Phil.

73
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,290
休息区
Break area.

74

复印机
Copier.

75
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,130
我的小臭狗
My stinky dog.

76
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,010
瞧瞧啊
Oh, look at you.

77
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,310
你刚刚吐了一地
You just threw up recently. Okay.

78
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,750
我的天呐
Oh, my gosh.

79
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,020
那是你和米歇尔・奥巴马
That's you and Michelle Obama.

80
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,230
那是我姨
That's my aunt.

81
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,550
真抱歉
I am so sorry.

82
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,240
我不知道我为什么会以为
I don't know why I thought that --

83
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,540
淡定  别有什么白人内疚感
Calm down, white guilt.

84
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,640
那就是米歇尔・奥巴马
It's Michelle Obama.

85
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,730
太好了
Oh, good, yeah.

86
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,080
是啊  这15年你成就了很多啊
Yeah, you've accomplished a lot in 15 years.

87
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,630
在事业上是的
Professionally, yeah.

88
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,110
我已经六个月没有约会了
I haven't had a date in six months.

89
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,700
有时候周日我会开车去看看我的冷冻卵子
Some sundays, I drive out to visit my frozen eggs.

90
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,080
但是从好的一面来说
But, on the plus side,

91
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,980
我跟我妈妈非常亲密
I have gotten really close with my mom.

92
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,610
看那照片  我都看出相似之处了
Oh, look at that. I see the resemblance.

93
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,440
那是马娅・安杰卢
That's Maya Angelou.

94
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,240
该死
Damn it.

95

98
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,330
是啊

99

-我真的非常期待  -你

100
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,400
昨晚那身衣服算怎么回事
What was that outfit last night?

101
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
那可是商务晚宴
That was a business dinner!

102
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080

What is wrong with you?

103

真不错啊
Oh, this is nice.

108
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,400
是啊  丹尼斯以前也很喜欢
Yeah. Dennis liked it...

109
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,930
后来就不喜欢了

119
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,750

不是吧
Oh, no.

124
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,190
[离开  否则你会死的]

125
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,730
我很喜欢皮革的
I do love it in leather.

126
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,720
那就试着喜欢丝绸的
Well, learn to love it in silk.

127
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,000
穿皮革出去太热了
It's too hot outside to be wearing leather.

128
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,670
我是说这辆车
I'm talking about this car.

129
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,570
顺便说一句
Oh, by the way,

130
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,860
今天去经销商那里  我来讲价
I do the negotiating at the dealership today.

00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,590
为什么

亲爱的  我是生意人
Honey, I'm a businessman.

133
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,750
跟人打交道
When it comes to people,

134
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,920
我知道该怎么从他们那里得到我想要的
I know how to get what I want out of them.

135
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,100
这块表
This watch --

136
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,260
那家伙最后是半价卖给我的
The man sold it to me for half of what he was asking.

137

这鞋  三分之一

138
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,100
这些  是免费的
These -- for free.

139
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,530
你说谁更会说服人  生意人先生
So, who's better at working people, Mr. Businessman?

140
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,920
好吧  我们方法不同
Fine. We have different approaches,

141
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,380
但我们都很厉害
but we're both pretty good.

142
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,490
喂  米奇
Hello, Mitch.

143
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,700
小子
Hey, buddy.

144
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,790
你看起来像是要站起来走路啊
You look like you want to get up and walk.

145
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,030
大器晚成  好吧
Late bloomer -- fine.

146
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,070
谁在乎别人家的小孩
Who cares if the other kids

147
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,500
叫你"慢吞吞的乔"呢
call you "Slo-Joe"?

148
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,810
他们就是这样叫你的
And they do, you know.

149
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,080
拜拜
Bye-bye.

150
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,240
我们得下次再去买车了

我们得照看莉莉
We have to sit Lily.

154
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,340
-怎么了  -没啥
- What? - Nothing.

155
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,100
只是...换做我的话就能推掉这件事
Just -- I could have got us out of that.

156
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,270
住手
Stop!

157
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,200
-吃掉  -从我身上下去
- Eat it! - Get off me!

158
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
吃草吧  牛儿
Eat the grass, cow!

159
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,240
-朗达  -您好  邓菲太太

160
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,060
妈妈

161
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,880
亲爱的  舞会就快开始了
Honey, it's getting very close to time for the dance.

162
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
你不该进屋去换衣服吗
Shouldn't you go in and get changed?

163
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,940
我已经换了
I did already.

164
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,660
他们在来的路上
The guys are coming by.

165
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,840
我们从这里骑车去
We're gonna ride from here.

166
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,960
你呢  朗达
What about you, Rhonda?

167
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,070
要进屋去把自己弄干净吗
You want to go in and get cleaned up?

168
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,270
-我没事  -是吗

169
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,710
你脸上还有泥巴呢
What about that dirt on your face?

170
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,090
卢克  你在这等着
Luke, you wait here.

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,020
和你朋友们骑车去
Ride with your friends.

172
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,810
我带朗达去  来吧
I will bring Rhonda. Come on.

173
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,930
进屋之前像狗那样
Just, um, give me a good shake like a dog

174
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,900
好好抖抖身上的泥巴
before you go inside.

175
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,860
我就知道
I know.

176
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,890
我爸爸有三处纹身
And my dad has three tattoos.

177
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,240
为啥啊  你都是当爹的人了
Like, "Why? You're a dad."

178
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,780
父母想要跟上潮流真是太可悲了
Ew! It's so sad when parents try.

179
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,200
我妈又在耳朵上打了耳洞
My mom double-pierced one of her ears,

180
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
我说  拜托
and I'm like, "Hello!

181
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,540
您都50了
You're 50."

182
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,110
这把年纪还打耳洞简直老到掉渣
It's so old, like, ancient to have an ear piercing.

183
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,100
你俩决定去舞会了吗
Uh, you two decide to go to the dance?

184
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,070
是啊  但不是认真地去
Well, yeah, but not really.

185
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,340
-但我们要去  -什么
- But, yeah. - What?

186
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,110
我们要带着讽刺态度过去
We're going ironically

187
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,390
嘲笑所有把这事看得很重的孩子们
to make fun of all the kids who make a big deal out of it.

188
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,820
讽刺个屁啊
"Ironic"? My ass.

189
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,340
艾丽克斯喜欢德鲁
Alex likes Drew.

190
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,990
她只是在打安全牌
She's just playing it safe.

191
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,020
有那种鲁莽讨厌的妈妈
Now, there are the pushy, obnoxious moms

192
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,170
喜欢卷入其中
who try and get involved,

193
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,400
为他们撮合撮合
nudge them towards one another.

194
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,140
我们是好意
We mean well.

195
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,130
衬衫不错啊  塔克教练
Fancy shirt, coach Tucker.

196
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,860
谢谢  你知道我喜欢说什么
Oh, thank you. You know what I like to say.

197
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,490
我可能是教练[二等舱]
I might be coach,

198
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,390
但我坐头等舱
but I travel first class.

199
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,970
你想不想
So, what would you think

200
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,830
在今晚的舞会上致开幕词啊
about giving the opening remarks at the dance tonight?

201
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,230
艺术委员会从来没有取得这么大的成就
The arts committee has never made this much,

202
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,420
这全都是因为你
and it's all because of you.

203
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,440
各位  我六个月前来到这所学校时
Oh, you guys, when I came to this school six months ago,

204
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,890
从没想到你们会敞开怀抱接纳我
I never would have imagined you would embrace me.

205
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,070
抱歉  这里是化学实验室吗
Excuse me? Is this a chem lab?

206
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,020
因为我在期待"大反应"
Because I'm looking for a big reaction.

207
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,380
这就有了
And there it is.

208
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,900
大家好啊
Hi. How are --

棒极了
Amazing.

212
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,130
我准备好...

...to take another vacation.

214
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,960
他怎么称呼啊
And how are we supposed to know him?

215
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,550
卡普兰先生  传奇的西班牙语老师
Senor Kaplan, legendary Spanish teacher.

216
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,990
我有点同情他
You know, my heart went out to him a little

217
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,810
因为他离开时还是大家的最爱
because he left as everyone's favorite,

218
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,860
我敢肯定关于我的消息传出去了
and I'm sure word got out about, you know...me.

219
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,330
我只是不想让他觉得被取代了
I just didn't want him to feel displaced.

220
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,400
好了  让一让  大个儿
Okay. Excuse me, big guy.

221
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,220

222
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,040
安吉拉  这是刚从阿奴拉达普勒带来的

225
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,010
这是给...
And this is for, um --

226
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,010
-她叫玛西亚  -玛西亚
- It's Marcia. - Marcia!

227
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,470
当然啦  我知道的
Right, of course. I knew that.

228
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,590
我刚才满脑子肯定都是西班牙语
I must have been having a "Senor" moment.

229
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,250
某人总是如此
Somebody's always on.

230
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,510
这是谁干的
Who did this?

231
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,180
出什么事了
What happened?

232
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,320
有人把我的包摔到地上
Somebody knocked my bag down

233
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,600
摔坏了我的手机
and broke my phone.

234
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,580
莉莉  你知道是怎么回事吗
Lily, do you know anything about this?

235
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,640
他干的
He did it.

236
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,990
乔
Joe.

237
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,760
是啊  我要去玩了
Yep. I'm going to go and play.

238
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,590
她撒谎了
She lies.

239
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,430
乔怎么会把包从桌子上推下去
How could Joe pull a bag off a table?

240
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,330
他都不会走路
He can't even walk.

241
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,310
我去和她谈谈
I'll talk to her.

242
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,270
为什么是你
Why you?

243
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,030
因为你是个知道怎么
Because you're such a businessman

244
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,420
和别人谈话的生意人吗
that knows how to talk to people?

245
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,040
相信我  我跟她谈完之后
Trust me. When I get done talking to her,

246
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,500
她不但会承认错误
not only will she have confessed to the crime,

247
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,410
我还可能卖给她一个橱柜
I might even sell her a closet.

248
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,060
我记得有次
I remember my buddies

249
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,320
小伙伴们和我在玩石头大战
and I were playing rock war once.

250
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,820
那是个游戏
That's a game

251
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,170
我们把石头丢到对方的脑袋上
where you chuck rocks at each other's heads.

252
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,220
能出什么事啊  对吧
What could go wrong, right?

253
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,950
我把一块石头砸到了
I put one through the window

254
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,940
我爸漫步者车的窗户上
of my old man's Rambler,

255
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,020
他觉得是我的小弟弟干的
and he thought my baby brother did it.

256
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,470
我无法接受
I couldn't take it,

257
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,260
告诉他是我干的
and I told him I did it.

258
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,950
坦白的感觉棒极了
It felt so good to confess,

259
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,200
我爸爸很为我感到骄傲
and my old man was so proud of me,

260
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,690
我甚至都没被他责罚
I didn't even get in any trouble.

261
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,240
知道吗
Y-you know?

262
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,760
是乔干的
Joe did it.

263
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,290
她很厉害
She's good.

264
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,080
好好看看  学着点
Watch and learn.

265
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,260
我觉得她不吃你
I don't think that cleavage thing

266
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,190
露乳沟这一套吧
is gonna work with this one.

267
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,970
我又不是只会这一招
That's not my only trick.

268
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,730
好啊  莉莉
Hola, Lily.

269
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,870
外公去哪儿了
Where did grandpa go?

270
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,330
别担心杰
Don't worry about Jay.

271
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,340
现在这里只有我和你
It's only you and me here now.

272
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,210
告诉我
So, tell me.

273
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,040
你最喜欢哪个
Which one of these is your favorite?

274
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,710
没关系
Fine.

275
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,890
慢慢来
One by one,

276
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,760
它们都会消失
they will disappear.

277
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,950
或早或晚
Sooner or later,

278
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,410
我们会找到你最爱的那个
we'll get to the one that you love.

279
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,630
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

280
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,970
他是中介之王
he's the emperor of escrow.

281
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,370
他太棒了
He puts the toot in tooter.

282
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,590
大家鼓掌欢迎
Let's put your hands together for

283
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,080
菲尔・邓菲
Phil Dunphy!

284
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,480
感谢这么好的司仪
Thanks for the kind introduction,

285
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
也就是我
me.

286
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,630
不像前几年
Now, unlike past years...

287
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,090
我不会再站在这
I'm not gonna stand up here

288
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,340
一直冲你们叽哩呱啦
and talk your ears off.

289
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,800
不  女士们先生们
No, ladies and gentlemen.

290
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,690
应该给你们点好东西
You deserve more.

291
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,080
今年
This year,

292
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,630
我要把词都唱出来
I'm gonna sing them off.

293
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,780
我要卖*
*I'm selling away

294
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,840
周六挂出一间房子开卖*
*Set an open house for Saturday

295
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,190
经纪人们的聚会*
*A gathering of agents

296
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,280
出现在大篷车*
*Appeared in caravan

297
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,460
我刚刚离婚*
*I'm a new divorce

298
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,710
我现在需要间房子*
*Now I need a house

299
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,140
可以让我养猫*
*That's cat-friendly

300
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:35,970
人们说伟大的艺术家
They say the greats

301
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,790
绝不会让任何事情影响表演
never let anything affect their performance.

302
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,380
或许这些伟人没有女儿
Well, maybe the greats never had a daughter

303
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,980
在你计划好的五次实时台上换装中的
who checked out during the third of five planned

304
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,640
第三次时走神
real-time, mid-performance wardrobe changes.

305
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,880
我不得不说
I'm not gonna lie.

306
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,520
这让我丧失了信心
It knocked me off my game.

307
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,580
在板子上*
*On the board

308
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,320
这是表演的一部分吗
Is this part of it?

309
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,240
不是
No.

310
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,780
这不是表演的一部分
It's not part of it.

311
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,220
在法学院
In law school,

312
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,760
温迪・柯克就有点容易情绪激动
Wendy Kirk could be a little intense.

313
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,540
我一直希望她会越来越温柔  可是
I always hoped that she'd soften over time, but...

314
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,120
有些人会向相反方向发展
...some people go the other way.

315
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,120
这地方是个噩梦
This place is a nightmare.

316
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,390
情况很糟糕
The conditions are deplorable,

317
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,460
大家都不应该
and no one should have to suffer

318
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,320
每天遭受这样的虐待
this kind of abuse on a daily basis.

319
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,570
什么暴君像这样完全不尊重人命啊
What kind of tyrant has such utter disregard for human life?

320
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,710
我干不下去了
I can't do this.

321
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,360
你必须干下去
You have to.

322
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,010
温迪需要听到
Wendy needs to hear it.

323
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,890
是啊  可我紧张  要是她
Yeah, but I'm nervous. You know, what if she --

324
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,240
-米奇尔  -是  你好
- Mitchell. - Yes! Hi!

325
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
我刚刚想到一个好主意
I just had a great idea.

326
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,650
我觉得你最适合培训雷克斯了
I think you would be the perfect person to groom Rex.

327
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,650
[Groom有清洗和培训两个意思]

328
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,540
什么
E-excuse me?

329
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,930
我只是觉得他真的会
I just think he'd really respond

330
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,230
和你这样的人产生共鸣
to someone like you, you know?

331
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,520
你不介意吧
Y-you don't mind, right?

332
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,400
不不  怎么会
Uh, uh, no. No, not at all.

333
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,270
太好了  谢谢
Great. Thanks.

334
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,510
麻烦你过去自我介绍一下吧
Will you go over and introduce yourself?

335
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,460
自我介  好吧
I-intro-- okay.

336
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,510
-好的  -谢谢
- Okay. Yeah. - Thank you.

337
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,510
你好  我是米奇尔
Hello. I'm Mitchell.

338
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,630
显然这现在是我的工作了
And, apparently, this is my job now.

339
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,680
天呐  你真臭
Oh, god, you smell.

340
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,740
大家都在看我
People are looking at me.

341
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,040
因为你让我把你打扮得很漂亮
That's because you let me make you beautiful.

342
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,230
别瞎说  我漂亮吗
Stop it. Am I?

343
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,870
你很美
Yes, you are.

344
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,680
玩得开心
Have fun.

345
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,870
去吧去吧
Go. Go.

346
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,320
德鲁  你好  德鲁
Drew. Hey, Drew.

347
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,220
玩得开心吗
Having fun?

348
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,110
开心  还好吧
"Fun"? Uh...okay.

349
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,170
德鲁  德鲁  听我说
Oh, Drew. Drew, listen.

350
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,890
我和菲尔今晚会很晚才回家
Phil and I are gonna be out really late tonight,

351
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,170
所以你开车带艾丽克斯回去时
so there will not be an adult at the house

352
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:23,570
家里没有大人
when you drop Alex off,

353
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,470
知道我什么意思吗
if you know what I mean.

354
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,990
是的  别担心
Yeah, don't worry.

355
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,310
我会开车送她回去
I'll, uh-- I'll drop her off,

356
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,250
我不会进屋的
and I won't go in.

357
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,410
大房子
Well... big house,

358
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,290
还有  可爱的女儿
you know... cute daughter--

359
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,540
我不反对你送她进门
I would not be opposed to you walking her in,

360
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,900
在我们回家前陪着她
keeping her company until we get back.

361
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,750
我刚说了
Like I said,

362
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,090
我们很晚才回家
we will not be back until late.

363
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,900
我听明白了  邓菲太太
I hear you, Mrs. Dunphy.

364
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,740
你可以相信我
You can trust me.

365
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,990
不得不相信你啊  因为我们
Well, gonna have to trust you because we have no way

366
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,740
无法知道你会干些什么
of knowing what you're gonna get up to.

367
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,360
这样  要是你的车挡在车道上
In fact, if your car is blocking the driveway,

368
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,880
我就鸣两次笛
I'll just honk twice

369
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,750
然后等你出来
and wait for you to come out.

370
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,550
-好的  -很好
- Okay. - Okay.

371
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,510
去找她吧  小伙子  快去
Go get her, tiger. Come on.

372
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
干得好  塔克
Nice job, Tucker.

373
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,310
你做了很多
I mean, you made so many choices

374
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,610
我不可能做出的选择
that I never would have made,

375
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,080
但大部分效果不错
but a lot of them are working.

376
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,990
这样啊
Oh, well, you know,

377
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,110
我就是看你策划的
I just watched the videos

378
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,230
很多很多舞会视频
of the many, many dances you planned

379
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,200
然后就想出了这么一个主意
and just built off that one on idea.

380
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,680
孩子们
Hey, kids!

381
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,730
我的小甜心们
There are my little chalupas!

382
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,030
你对朗达做了什么
Um, what did you do to Rhonda?

383
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,920
我把她整干净了
I cleaned her up.

384
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,220
不  你毁了她
No, you broke her.

385
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,490
我不喜欢这样的她
I hate her like this.

386
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,720
她美极了
She looks fantastic.

387
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,520
对你来说是
To you!

388
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,530
把她变回去  这样很伤脑筋
Fix her. Ugh, it confuses me.

389
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,730
卢克啊
Oh, Luke.

390
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,990
"家里没人"
"The house will be empty"?

391
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,610
你在给我拉皮条
You are pimping me out!

392
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,400
你俩显然喜欢对方
It is clear that the two of you like one another.

393
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,690
有时需要有人推你们一把
Sometimes, you need a little nudge.

394
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,030
你可是行为监督人啊
Well, you're a chaperone!

395
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,330
快消失吧
Just disappear!

396
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,880
这舞会不是你该来的地方
This dance is not for you!

397
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,820
你真走运  居然是水
You're lucky that's water.

398
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,480
该死
Damn it.

399
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,710
她已经生了一个小时的闷气了
She's been stewing in there for an hour.

400
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,190
我们不如锁上门
I say let's lock the door,

401
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,270
拉了电闸
cut the power.

402
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,770
让她意识到我们态度有多严肃
Let's show her that we mean business.

403
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,500
我们先采取温和点的手段吧  监狱长
Let's try the joint approach first..."Gitmo."

404
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,500
[Gitmo: 古巴臭名昭著的关塔那摩湾监狱]

405
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,580
我们仔细思考了一下你的供词
Okay, we've been going over your story,

406
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,830
不怎么有说服力
and it doesn't add up.

407
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,250
我放包的地方对乔来说太高了
My purse was too high for Joe to reach.

408
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,450
他已经能够着这里了
He's tall enough to reach up here.

409
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,090
他为了拿到我的小动物们
He knocked over the baby powder

410
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,750
把婴儿爽身粉碰倒了
trying to get my stuffed animals.

411
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,850
我不信
Not buying it.

412
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,510
看  这还有他走过的脚印呢
Look. You can see the footprints where he walked.

413
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,340
走
Walk?

414
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,170
莉莉  莉莉  莉莉
Lily, Lily, Lily.

415
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,670
乔还不会走路呢
Joe can't walk.

416
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,150
他在我面前走了
He does for me.

417
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,300
所以你有办法让他走路吗
So, you have ways of making him walk?

418
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,720
莉莉  就承认是你做的吧
Lily, just admit that you did it.

419
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,970
过来  乔
Come here, Joe.

420
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,370
像你之前做的那样
Come here like you did before.

421
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,350
宝贝  你在自找难堪
Honey, you're embarrassing yourself.

422
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,920
-过来  乔  -他不会走路
- Come here, Joe. - He can't walk.

423
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,070
他居然会走了
He's walking!

424
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,500
我之前点的那些蜡烛起作用了
The candles that I lit worked!

425
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,680
看他的步子迈得多大
Look at the stride on him.

426
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,650
他走得跟山羊一样稳健
He's as surefooted as a mountain goat.

427
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,710
我就说嘛
Told you.

428
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,920
真对不起我们怀疑你了
I'm so sorry that we doubted you.

429
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,030
不敢相信我居然这么幸运
Boy, did I get lucky.

430
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,370
在他学会说话之前
I'm going to blame everything on him

431
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,370
他都会是我的替罪羊
until he learns how to talk.

432
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,300
那个男人跳着华尔兹自以为是舞池之王
This guy waltzes in here like he's king of the dance

433
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,880
说什么帮助不发达地区建学校
after doing god knows what in Sri Lanka,

434
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,840
都不知道他在斯里兰卡干了什么勾当
building schools in underdeveloped areas.

435
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,980
都不知道他想干嘛
What does that even mean?

436
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,310
你对那个男人是不是有点太苛刻了
Is it possible that you're being a little hard on the man?

437
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,760
是我把他的二流舞会办成了年度盛事
I turned his two-bit dance into the event of the year.

438
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,370
看  小混混和书呆子
Look. Burnouts and dweebs

439
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,190
能这么和谐共处
hanging out together in harmony.

440
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,420
都是我的功劳
That is me.

441
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,580
我很遗憾  小卡
I'm sorry, Cam.

442
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,720
别替我遗憾
Oh, don't feel sorry for me.

443
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,220
马上就是教职员工舞蹈环节
Next is faculty dance.

444
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,210
卡普兰不会跳舞
Kaplan can't move.

445
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,200
都传到Tumblr上了
It's on his Tumblr.

446
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,200
[Tumblr: 微视频社交网站]

447
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,690
那是他的一大耻辱
It's his big shame.

448
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,630
相信我
Trust me.

449
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,200
他抢不走我的风头
He can't touch this.

450
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,170
好了  到了教职员工起舞的时候了
Okay, time now for the faculty dance.

451
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,510
老师们  上吧
Go, teachers.

452
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,290
你确定吗
Oh, are you sure?

453
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,550
停  现在是小卡秀场
Stop. It's "Cammer" Time.

454
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,020
不介意我也来跳吧  教练
Mind if I join you, coach?

455
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,970
休假期间
While on sabbatical,

456
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,380
我在斯里兰卡跟质多斯那学了点舞蹈
I learned a thing or two from Sri Lanka's own Chitrasena.

457
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,380
[质多斯那: 斯里兰卡舞蹈之父]

458
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,010
我不知道他是谁
I don't know who that is,

459
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,470
而且你说话的态度很讨人厌
and it's annoying when you say things

460
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,480
好像谁都应该知道他似的
like people are supposed to know!

461
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,100
看来那个可悲的孔雀男
That pathetic peacock of a man

462
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,570
是要跟我一战到底
was not going down without a fight.

463
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,310
我必须做出选择
I had a choice to make --

464
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,660
要么跳得比他好  要么比他大度
be the better dancer or the bigger man.

465
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,120
所以我离开了舞台
So, I stepped off the dance floor

466
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,710
做了最正确的选择
and made the obvious call.

467
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,880
你想吸引大家的注意力吗
You want to win over a crowd?

468
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,920
去邀请一位孤独的母亲共舞吧
Invite a lonely mom to dance.

469
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,290
她没有想到我这一招
She never saw it coming,

470
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,680
他也一样
and neither did he.

471
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,770
喂  老兄
Hey Senor.

472
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,740
学着点吧
You just got out-coached.

473
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,290
我尝试看向事物更积极的一面
I try and look on the bright side of things.

474
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,350
我是那种即使要给臭狗洗澡
I-I'm a doggy-bath-is-half-full

475
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,560
也依然乐观的人
kind of guy.

476
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,160
但我应该醒悟了
But it was time for me to open my eyes.

477
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,910
我的老板是个禽兽
I was working for a monster.

478
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,660
我来这里工作是为了替弱势群体说话
I came to this job to be the voice of the downtrodden.

479
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,930
可没想到弱势群体居然就是我的同事
Turns out those downtrodden were my co-workers,

480
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,790
他们迫切地需要屠龙的英雄
and they were desperate for a hero to slay their dragon.

481
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,730
各位  不好意思我来晚了
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

482
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,850
雷克斯  你跟米奇尔处得怎么样
Um, Rex, how's it going with Mitchell?

483
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,470
新来的那个吗
The new guy?

484
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,590
我还没见过他呢
I haven't met him yet.

485
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,680
真奇怪  我让他来自我介绍了啊
That's weird. I asked him to introduce himself.

486
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,970
有人看到我的狗了吗
hey, has anybody seen my dog?

487
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,040
皮克希
Pixie!

488
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,300
她来了
Oh, there she is.

489
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,210
温迪  不好意思
Okay, Wendy, I'm sorry.

490
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,320
我有话想跟你说
I-I have something to say to you,

491
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,660
一些在座诸位都不敢说的话
something that everybody else here is afraid to say.

492
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,600
我知道你现在做的都是好事
Now, I know you're fighting the good fight,

493
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,140
可是这也不能成为你如此对待别人的借口
but that is no excuse for the way you treat people.

494
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,830
不过这倒有可能导致
T-that actually might be one of the reasons

495
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,000
你没有亲密爱人
that you have no personal life

496
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,210
毕竟谁也不想回家面对
because who wants to come home

497
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,510
一个冷血无情的恶棍
to a-a cold, emotionless...thug?

498
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,160
你  你都在说什么啊
W-what are you talking about?

499
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,420
我是一名经验丰富值得尊重的律师
I am an experienced, respected attorney,

500
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,630
可是上班第一天
and on my first day,

501
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,650
你居然让我去给雷克斯洗澡
you asked me to bathe Rex.

502
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,880
我有点无法忍受
I'm not comfortable with that.

503
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,370
我也无法忍受
And I'm not comfortable with that,

504
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,470
可我还是做了
but I did it.

505
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,340
好吧  那是皮克希
Okay, that's Pixie.

506
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,390
这才是雷克斯
This is Rex,

507
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,200
我让你培训的实习生
the intern I asked you to groom.

508
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,990
好吧  这是我的错
And that is my mistake,

509
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,950
我负全责
and I own that.

510
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,520
可即使那样
But that is still no excuse

511
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,740
你也没有理由因为他
for the way that you tore into him

512
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,200
昨天的穿着对他大吼大叫
for the outfit he wore yesterday.

513
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,060
我当时是为了他给我挑的衣服生气
I was talking about the outfit he picked out for me.

514
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,200
很明显  我招了世界上唯一一个
Apparently, I have the one gay intern in the world

515
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,020
没有时尚嗅觉的男同性恋实习生
with absolutely no fashion sense.

516
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,570
我不了解当时的背景情况
I was unaware of -- of this dynamic.

517
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,550
可是我  我不是一个人  对吧
But I-I-I'm not alone here, all right?

518
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,870
这屋里肯定还有别人觉得你是
There are people in this room who feel that you are --

519
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,060
我们应该怎么说呢
How did we say it? --

520
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,540
你是个毫不尊重他人的暴君
you are a tyrant with no regard for human life.

521
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,140
听起来像我那个恶房东案子的总结陈词
That sounds like my summation for the slum-lord case.

522
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,120
什么  你写完了吗
Oh, hey, you finished it?

523
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,090
写得超棒
It's wonderful.

524
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,510
可是他不好意思给你看
But he's nervous to show you.

525
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,350
你怎么对自己那么苛刻呢
Why are you so hard on yourself?

526
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:24,990
好吧  那  那么
Okay, but w-w-what --

527
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,960
你强迫我们周日工作又怎么说
what about you making us work on sundays?

528
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,290
是在说  周日晚去我家烧烤吗
That -- the night of my barbecue?

529
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:28,990
丹
Dan?

530
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,120
你怎么还在这里
What are you still doing here?

531
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,030
今天是你的结婚纪念日  快回家
It's your anniversary! Go home!

532
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,640
天哪  告诉我这不是真的
Oh, god. This isn't happening.

533
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,750
不  不  她很疯狂
No, no. She's -- she's crazy.

534
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,380
我看到她攻击自动售货机
I mean, I saw her attack the vending machine.

535
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,690
自从丹尼斯把它弄坏以后就只能那样用了
That's the only way it works since Dennis broke it.

536
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,360
丹尼斯就是之前用我那间办公室的人吗
Dennis is the guy whose office I took?

537
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,470
是的  他曾是那个机器最好的客户
Yeah, he was the machine's best customer

538
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,500
直到他开始跑步
until he started running.

539
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,380
有一天他说  他一定要离开  否则
One day, he said he's got to get out or --

540
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,790
他就会死  好吧  好吧
He would die. Okay. Okay.

541
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,880
温迪
Wendy, um...

542
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,750
我也许应该向你道歉
I-I might owe you a little bit of an apology,

543
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,940
对不起
so I'm sorry.

544
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,830
很明显  这里每个人都很爱你
Um, clearly, everybody here loves you,

545
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,520
我之前把一切都搞错了
and I-I was wrong about everything.

546
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,540
所以  对不起
So...I'm sorry.

547
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,950
你知道吗  你也不是全搞错了
You know, you -- you weren't wrong about everything.

548
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,120
我虽然拿这事开玩笑  但你是对的
I mean, look, I do joke about it, but you're right.

549
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,840
我孤单一人
I'm alone.

550
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,210
这也不是第一次有人说我冷漠
And that is not the first time that someone has called me cold.

551
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,300
我的那些卵子
Okay, those eggs...

552
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,320
那些卵子取出来就是冷冻的
those eggs came out of me frozen.

553
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,650
而且我还这么高
And I'm impossibly tall.

554
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,480
即使我能找到一个人来爱我
And even if I could find somebody to love me,

555
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,500
他们也够不着啊
they -- they wouldn't be able to reach.

556
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,730
不  别这样
No -- hey, hey. Come on.

557
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,140
你是个很了不起的女性
You're -- you're an amazing woman.

558
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,780
她是个了不起的女性
She's an amazing woman.

559
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,340
而且  你是个榜样
And you -- you're a-a role model.

560
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,460
你是个英雄
You're a hero.

561
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,900
我是个六尺高的英雄
I'm a 6-foot hero.

562
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:21,920
不  别这样
No. Come on.

563
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,550
你周围的人都爱你
You're surrounded by people who love you.

564
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,300
有丹还有雷克斯
Here's Dan and Rex.

565
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,000
还有我  过来
Me. Come here.

566
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,720
还有挂在那里的塞缪尔・杰克逊
All the way up to Samuel L. Jackson there.

567
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,560
那是你妈妈戴着袋鼠牌帽子  是吗
That's your mother in a Kangol hat, isn't it?

568
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,620
是的
Yeah.

569
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,740
你确定你自己在干什么吗  塔德
Um, are you sure you know what you're doing, Tad?

570
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,980
我知道你来自抵押医生[机构]  但是
I know you're the Mortgage Doctor, but --

571
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,770
有人问  这里有医生吗
Someone said, "Is there a doctor in the house?"

572
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,130
难道我不应该站出来吗
Was I supposed to not get up?

573
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,290
爸爸  你需要我帮你脱掉裙子吗
Hey, dad. You need any help out of that dress?

574
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,190
除非你想看我
Not unless you want to see me

575
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,070
一丝不挂只穿着一个新年婴儿纸尿裤
in nothing but a baby new year's diaper.

576
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,660
那是你在发短信时
That was the big finish

577
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,250
我要唱的歌的结尾重头戏
to the song you were texting through.

578
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,280
我就收了一条短信  我看了大部分节目
Hey, I got one text. I saw most of the show --

579
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,120
我们这就走了
We're leaving, okay?

580
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,090
你能回桌子上
Could you just go to the table

581
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,650
拿我的钥匙和包吗
and grab my keys and purse?

582
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,620
好吧
Fine.

583
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,130
你想聊聊吗
You want to talk about it?

584
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,060
你到底能假扮几种医生
How many kinds of fake doctor are you?

585
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,360
好了  到了揭晓今晚大奖的时刻了
Okay, time for the big award of the night,

586
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,310
"年地经"奖[年度地产经纪]
The ROY...

587
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,510
我都不知道自己为什么生她的气
I don't even know why I'm mad at her.

588
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,140
也许只是因为她整晚都显得很无聊
Probably just 'cause she was so bored all night.

589
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,970
也许你感觉自己不被她接纳
Maybe you're feeling rejected?

590
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,080
是我自己的错
It's my own fault.

591
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,720
我给了自己一个错误的希望
I built up this hope

592
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,610
以为她会愿意追随我进入地产业
that she'd want to follow me into real estate.

593
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,910
菲尔・邓菲
...Phil Dunphy.

594
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,420
她现在有自己的生活了

595
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,440
我只是不知道我们还能在哪里有联系
I just don't know where we connect anymore.

596
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,660
你赢了
You won.

597
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,800

扶我起来
Help me up!

599
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,960
我们都知道
As we all know,

600
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,610
菲尔今晚出了点小意外

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,370
我来

605
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,840
大家好  我是

我是海莉  菲尔的女儿

607
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,130
爸爸  你赢得了"年地经"
Dad, you won the ROY!

608
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,180
你们都知道他是个出色的地产经纪
You all know him as an amazing realtor,

609
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,220
但我知道他还是世界上最棒的爸爸
but I know him as the world's greatest dad.

610
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,990
据我所知
As far as I'm concerned,

611
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,480
他也是年度最佳父亲
he's the dad of the year,

612
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,040
"年爸爸"奖得主
the "DOY."

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,900
今晚真的很遗憾
It really is a shame

614
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,800
你们没有听完他的完整演出
that you didn't hear the rest of his act tonight.

615
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,170
但我有听过他排练
I-I heard him rehearsing it.

616
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,590
你们哪位是J.J.・麦卡宾
Which one of you is J.J. McCubbin?

617
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,350
快速问答  J.J.
Oh. Hey, quick question, J.J. --

618
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,670
为什么一个好的抵押就像
Why is a great mortgage rate

619
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,510
你老婆的床上表现
like your wife in bed?

620
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,420
一个月一次还低利息[兴趣]
Once a month and low interest.

621
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,250
你笑什么  斯基普・伍斯奴
What are you laughing at, Skip Woosnum?

622
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,210
自从你加入海军后
You haven't seen a commission

623
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,900
就没收过佣金了[服役]
since you joined the navy.

624
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,820
她真是棒极了
She is killing it.

625
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,620
这才是我闺女
That's my girl.

626
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,440
但我会在"海军"上加重语气
I would have hit the word "Navy" harder.

627
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,690
还有什么  还有什么来着
What else? What else?

628
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,840
玛格利特・福曼也来了
Oh! Margaret Furman's here.

629
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,460
我要提醒一下她的男伴
Little heads-up to her date --

630
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,400
她比房利美公司拥有更多资不抵债住房
She's been upside-down in more houses than Fannie Mae.

631
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:28,440
或者说  房利一定会美
Or, in her case, Fannie definitely will.

632
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,420
我们都希望别人看到自己最好的一面
We all want people to think the best of us...

633
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,180
所以有时我们会隐藏一些事
So sometimes we cover things up

634
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,810
以保护自己
to protect ourselves.

635
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,020
但我们不必害怕
But we don't have to be afraid...

636
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,410
因为真相永远是一件好事
Because the truth is always a good thing.

637
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,750
真相让我们自由
The truth sets us free...

638
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,620
让我们更亲近
...brings us closer.

639
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,660
你想不想告诉我们
So, do you want to tell us

640
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,140
乔的鞋怎么会穿错脚了呢
How Joe's shoes ended up on the wrong feet?

641
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,340
看来小家伙学会了自己穿鞋
I guess the little guy knows how to put on his own shoes.

642
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,400
开始吧  伙计  你能行
There you go, buddy. You got this.

643
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,310
你在干什么
What are you doing?

644
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,380
既然乔会走路了
Since Joe can walk now,

645
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,930
我觉得他应该分担些家务了
I figured he should be doing a few chores.

646
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:10,950
稳一点  大小伙
Steady, big guy!

647
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,300
家务  什么样的
Chores? What kind of --

648
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,560
他来了
There he is.

649
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,930
好孩子
Attaboy!

650
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:16,170
好孩子
Attaboy!

651
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,470
啤酒  你疯了吗
A beer? Are you crazy?

652
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,890
你去哪  你想来点吗
Where you going? You want some?

653
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,660
他也可以给你拿
He'll bring it to you.

654
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,650
我简直不敢相信你竟然教他做那种事
I can't believe that you're teaching him to do that.

655
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,290
看完第二段再评论吧
Wait till you see part two.

656
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,880
好孩子
Attaboy.

657
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,210
放心吧  是我自己
Relax, it was me.
