1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,920
All right. I'll call Carlos.
One sec. I'm calling Carlos.

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,000
- Hola.
<i>- Hola. Uh, buenas noches.</i>

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,720
<i>Who am I speaking with?</i>

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,800
Um, you are speaking... You don't know?

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,480
Are you joking?

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,920
- <i>Who am I talking to? Come on.</i>
- Uh, it's Lando!

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,040
<i>Lando!</i>

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,400
You and Carlos, as we know,
have struck up a very close bond

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,520
with lots of banter
in your relationship as teammates.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,040
We kinda went into the first time meeting
and that was how it all started.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
- Been doing well, this <i>cabrón, </i>lately.
- This <i>cabrón! </i>This <i>cabrón!</i>

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,561
So we're gonna spend
some more... some more time together.

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,840
It's been good for me, um,

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,160
obviously, learning from a guy with,
with such experience.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,120
Guacamole.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,280
Guacamoley.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,400
No. "Moley". No.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,000
- Guacamoley.
- No.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,240
You seem to be
the best pairing in the paddock.

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,680
Get to the chopper!

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,000
I think we have the right balance.
We're sharing good moments together.

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,920
Ooh!

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,880
How much are you gonna miss him
when he does move to Ferrari next year?

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,440
- Uh...
- Hmm...

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,600
<i>Big news out of Italy.</i>

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,720
<i>In a surprise move,</i>

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,160
<i>Carlos Sainz has decided to leave
his Formula 1 family, McLaren,</i>

28
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,920
<i>at the end of the year
to join Ferrari for the 2021 season.</i>

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,880
The silly season of driver moves

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,120
is happening
in the early part of the season.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,400
Carlos has got to go through
the entire season with his team and Lando

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,080
knowing that, at the end of the year,
they're gonna part ways.

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,280
It could be very difficult for him.

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,880
Shall we go?

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Let's go.

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,280
Last year, I'm very happy
with my success at McLaren.

37
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,800
<i>- Yes!
- </i>Wow!

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,840
<i>- Great job, mate.</i>
- Can't believe it, guys.

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,720
It's probably been
my strongest year in F1,

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,920
so it makes me feel proud and happy.

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
That's good.

42
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,760
Mulligan. How bad.

43
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,120
Fore left.

44
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Ah!

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,480
<i>Carlos has achieved
so many things in Formula 1.</i>

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,240
<i>Especially this last year.</i>

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,640
<i>I'm very proud of him.</i>

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,120
- Let's go.
- Advantage Jon Rahm.

49
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,960
No, I am Jon Rahm.

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,520
Who do you want to be?

51
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Choose.

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
Today, I am...

53
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
Rickie Fowler.

54
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,400
It will be hard
to leave McLaren next year,

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,080
but I think being a Ferrari driver

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,440
is one of the most special things
in Formula 1.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,120
It's on the checklist
of pretty much every driver.

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,520
I've got the opportunity to do it.

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,440
This part is very tense.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,680
Come on!

61
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,720
<i>I believe that
Carlos will achieve many great things.</i>

62
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,360
Good shot.

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,080
- Did it cross over?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,240
<i>But Formula 1 is a tough business</i>

65
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,560
<i>and Carlos has seen some tough times.</i>

66
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,360
Nice look at birdie.

67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,840
Oi! Gentlemen!

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
Rickie Fowler has just messed up.

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,240
<i>He needs to make sure he keeps focused</i>

70
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,880
<i>and he will not have any problem
to find his way to the top.</i>

71
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,240
You should have been Ian Poulter.

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,720
Carlos got the opportunity
to go to Ferrari.

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,240
But this is a business,
so we'll have to get on with it.

74
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,200
I think,
looking back over the last week,

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,240
it's sad to see Carlos going.

76
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,920
But the media, definitely, um,

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,800
I think the Seb news was the thing
that took them by surprise.

78
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Mm.

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,560
How Seb divorced Ferrari,
that's not very pretty. I think...

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,800
Carlos has been doing...

81
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,280
We did agree,
"Let's get a few interviews done."

82
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,040
"We know people are asking about Ferrari,
but let's get interviews out of the way."

83
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,800
So, by the time we get to Austria,

84
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,480
that story's now covered,
we can get back to racing

85
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,960
and he can talk about the rest of the year
with us, which is what he wants.

86
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,280
He's leaving McLaren.

87
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,680
How is this working relationship
even going to continue,

88
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,320
with McLaren knowing
that Sainz is going to Ferrari?

89
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,320
What's going on, dude?

90
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,960
<i>- Hey, Mr. Brown. What's happening?</i>
- How are you?

91
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,800
<i>- Good to see you. Yeah. All good.</i>
- Good.

92
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,160
I, uh, I talked to Carlos earlier.

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,960
<i>It's strange also for the team.
We discussed it also with Tom already.</i>

94
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,160
<i>Uh, obviously knowing that he's leaving
at the end of the year,</i>

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,760
<i>so at some point the normal rules
of engagement will come into...</i>

96
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,960
<i>into action</i>

97
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,200
<i>with not giving him all the information
anymore etc..</i>

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,480
When somebody is leaving
to go and race for a rival,

99
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,120
you don't want them to take
all of the knowledge

100
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,400
that you are going to try and use
to beat that team with in the future.

101
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,760
So, yeah, it's... it's only normal

102
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,880
that a racing driver starts
to get marginalized in his own team

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,360
when it's already known
that he's off to a rival.

104
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
<i>Austria is a stunning country.</i>

105
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,400
<i>Styria is a wonderful place to be.</i>

106
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,640
<i>And, for the first time,
we have the Styrian Grand Prix.</i>

107
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,160
<i>But, today, it's pouring with rain.</i>

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,840
<i>I can't see this drying out
in the near future.</i>

109
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,000
- Everyone good?
<i>- Yeah. You?</i>

110
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,160
Yeah, good.

111
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,160
<i>Do you think that McLaren
will get a podium finish?</i>

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,400
I hope so. I hope so.

113
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,640
We're gonna give it a go.
We did it last time.

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,600
- If anyone gets it, it might be this guy.
<i>- Lando!</i>

115
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,000
- Hello.
- You're way more excited to see him.

116
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,240
<i>Lando!</i>

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,880
Lando came out of the gates,
uh, very strong

118
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,440
and he had an, uh, awesome first race,
and I'm... I'm very proud.

119
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,360
See ya.

120
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
He showed a tremendous amount
of speed, a lot of racecraft.

121
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,200
Everything that we said,
"Here's what 2020 needs to look like."

122
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,960
<i>- Hello.
- Tony, show Lando your car!</i>

123
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,640
Nice.

124
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,520
I've had a very good start to 2020,

125
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,920
scoring my first podium in Formula 1
in the first race of the season.

126
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,840
Woo-hoo-hoo!

127
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Yes!

128
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,600
It was a dream start.

129
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,040
Something I never dreamt of,
kind of thing.

130
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,080
I think Lando's success
in the first race

131
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,640
caught everybody by surprise,

132
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
especially Carlos.

133
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,600
McLaren's moving
in a new and exciting direction

134
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,840
led by Zak Brown.

135
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,000
I think Lando lies at the heart of it.

136
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,880
Zak loves Lando Norris.

137
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,360
It's almost like
a father-son relationship.

138
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,480
Lando sits at the very center
of everything Zak wants McLaren to be.

139
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,720
<i>It's still incredibly wet out,</i>

140
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,840
<i>but it's now within the bounds
of the drivers to be able to go out.</i>

141
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Lando did a very good first race.

142
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,800
He managed to finish third
and I finished P5.

143
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,560
It actually was very close,
because I was coming from behind

144
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,720
and I had a chance to overtake him
and didn't quite make it stick.

145
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,120
I mean, if I had known it was for
a podium, I think I would have made it.

146
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,560
Myself and Carlos,
we've always had a, a good friendship.

147
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,560
But last year, I was a rookie.
There was a lot of slack.

148
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,960
Whereas this year, I'm pushing him more,

149
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,520
and I guess that's never something
that you wanna see your teammate do.

150
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,400
In 2019,
Lando Norris was in his rookie season.

151
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
This year,

152
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,280
Lando's a much more confident racer
than he was.

153
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,040
<i>Green light in two minutes. Two minutes.</i>

154
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,800
My self-confidence as a driver

155
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,200
tells me that I am prepared
to lead this team.

156
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,800
I want to be on top.

157
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,800
<i>They're all trying to get
out there. Vettel is heading the field.</i>

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,560
<i>That's one minute now.</i>

159
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,760
Keep me posted on the rain intensity.

160
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
<i>Copy, will do.</i>

161
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,160
<i>Green light, and off they go.</i>

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,480
<i>Carlos, the radar suggests
this kind of rain for the whole session.</i>

163
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,000
<i>Radar suggests rain should be continuous
and same intensity as this.</i>

164
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,480
Every time it rains
on a Formula 1 track,

165
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,160
you know the whole thing is gonna
go chaotic and it's gonna be a good show.

166
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,760
<i>Oh, and he's spun!</i>

167
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,680
<i>Jesus Christ! </i>Fucking joke, this.

168
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,640
<i>A huge amount of spray
out there. This is really testing.</i>

169
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,480
<i>Whoa!</i>

170
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,720
Fuck.

171
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,280
Carlos is extremely good in the wet.

172
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,640
How smooth he is with the hands,
how he goes on the throttle.

173
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,480
It's unbelievable.

174
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,760
<i>Last lap was P4. Good job, Carlos.</i>

175
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,200
<i>So you'll get three more laps.
Three more laps.</i>

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,360
I cannot see a thing.

177
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,960
<i>The Ferrari car's
about a second a lap slower than it was</i>

178
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,800
<i>at this circuit last year.</i>

179
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,440
- Where are we?
<i>- We finished P10.</i>

180
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
I tried.

181
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,840
Lando, you're the ninth car
out on track, Carlos in front.

182
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Yeah, I got traffic from Carlos.

183
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,880
<i>Watch for Lando.</i>

184
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,000
What's the rain doing?

185
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,960
The radar suggests
it will get worse through the session.

186
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
It's definitely more wet now.

187
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,720
<i>Look how treacherous
the conditions are!</i>

188
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,840
Conditions are getting
pretty bad again.

189
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Yep, okay. Understood.

190
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
<i>Be careful.</i>

191
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,000
<i>Oh! Lando Norris
just locking up a bit into turn 1.</i>

192
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,640
Can't see anything.
Not gonna improve.

193
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,960
<i>Okay, Lando.
You qualified in sixth.</i>

194
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,000
<i>- I should've done more.
- Points come tomorrow, mate.</i>

195
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,680
<i>- You've got one lap.</i>
- Let's keep pushing.

196
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,000
<i>Here's Sainz on an impressive lap.</i>

197
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,920
<i>Keep pushing this lap.</i>

198
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Copy.

199
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,840
<i>Sainz next to cross the line. What a lap!</i>

200
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,680
<i>Carlos Sainz will start third on the grid
for McLaren</i>

201
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,280
<i>in a brilliant qualifying performance
from the Spaniard.</i>

202
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
<i>Vamos!</i>

203
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,120
<i>You're P3, Carlos. P3.</i>

204
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,640
Bravo, bravo, bravo!

205
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,680
<i>- Vamos! </i>Come on!
- Come on!

206
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,960
One of those laps
that I will remember forever.

207
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,200
It takes big cojones to do a lap like that
in the wet, definitely. Definitely.

208
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,760
<i>Glorious sound
of engines beginning to rev</i>

209
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,560
<i>echoing around the hills here.</i>

210
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,520
<i>The rain has gone away.
It's a glorious day here in Spielberg.</i>

211
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,816
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello.

212
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,240
I'm good. And you okay?

213
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,880
You're in charge today.
So, go get 'em!

214
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,400
<i>Lewis Hamilton,
the first man</i>

215
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,640
<i>to take at least one pole
in 14 consecutive seasons.</i>

216
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,600
<i>He starts on pole position,
and alongside him, Max Verstappen,</i>

217
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,560
<i>who's on the front row, second on
the grid, for the third consecutive race.</i>

218
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,600
<i>Behind these two, on row two,
Carlos Sainz of McLaren,</i>

219
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,280
<i>third on the grid for the second...</i>

220
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,600
<i>It'll be close.</i>

221
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,440
<i>Renault, McLaren, Racing Point,
fighting for positions.</i>

222
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,960
<i>We look forward to this one.</i>

223
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,360
<i>They spur each other on,
don't they? Fighting it out.</i>

224
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,680
<i>They do.
Carlos, more experienced than Lando.</i>

225
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,720
<i>When it comes down to it,
they're very serious individuals,</i>

226
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,880
<i>and they both want to beat each other
so badly.</i>

227
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,760
You can see the desire to beat each other
has gone up some.

228
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,160
So it's a very, very healthy, uh, rivalry.

229
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,640
But you never wanna favor drivers.

230
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,520
On track, the frustrations
are going to be more pronounced

231
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,960
when the fight between them
is as close as it is.

232
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,600
Will Carlos still be the top dog
at McLaren, as he was in 2019?

233
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,960
<i>- Okay, Carlos, radio check.
- </i>Yeah, radio's good.

234
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,480
It's all got quite serious this year.

235
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,040
I think it's game on.

236
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,680
<i>Good start, Carlos. P3.</i>

237
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,440
High-speed section was good.

238
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,320
I'm happy
where I am at the moment.

239
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
<i>Copy.</i>

240
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
<i>The two Ferraris,</i>

241
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,960
<i>Sebastian Vettel
and Charles Leclerc, make contact!</i>

242
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,320
I got pushed aside.

243
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,360
What the hell?

244
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
<i>Box, box.</i>

245
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,400
<i>Sebastian Vettel,
first retirement of the race.</i>

246
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,920
<i>Caution, debris.</i>

247
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
<i>Be careful.</i>

248
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Copy.

249
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,680
<i>We can go racing again.
Let's get back to the battle out in front.</i>

250
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,440
<i>Carlos Sainz in third place.</i>

251
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Next car behind is Lando.

252
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,200
<i>Gap to Lando, 2.5.</i>

253
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,800
Carlos, if he gets to one second,
we're gonna consider team orders.

254
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,320
<i>Look, the two McLarens
are gonna have a little tussle as well.</i>

255
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,720
<i>Lando, keep close on Carlos.</i>

256
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,360
Gap to Carlos, 1.3.

257
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,680
<i>Lando, I need you to get closer.</i>

258
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,320
<i>Gap to Carlos, one second.</i>

259
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,400
- Can I push? We should go racing.
<i>- Carlos, we have to let him go.</i>

260
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,800
<i>Lando, he'll get out of your way.</i>

261
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,600
He just turned in on me.
What's he trying to do?

262
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,360
<i>Lando, just be mindful.
Just be mindful.</i>

263
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
<i>Okay, Carlos, no fight with Lando.</i>

264
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,920
Team decision.

265
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,080
Fucking hell.

266
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,240
Anytime that we need
to let the other driver through,

267
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,800
it's only because we think
that's the faster car.

268
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,520
Appreciate it, guys.

269
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,040
Instead of it being me
having to let him go

270
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,200
and sacrifice my race in some ways,
uh, it's been the opposite way around,

271
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,200
and I've been the one
in the, the prime position.

272
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,360
<i>We're on the final lap.</i>

273
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,760
<i>There goes Lando Norris,
round the outside.</i>

274
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
<i>Norris could take this.</i>

275
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,600
<i>Norris is past the Racing Point!</i>

276
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,800
Come on!

277
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,280
<i>Oh, it's a tight finish!
It's a photo finish!</i>

278
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,800
<i>P5.</i>

279
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,960
Whoa!

280
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
<i>What a race. What a race!</i>

281
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,760
<i>Lando Norris, what a grandstand finish.</i>

282
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,800
<i>Yes, Lando! Yes!</i>

283
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,400
Yeah, boys!

284
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,360
That is racing, mate.
That is racing. Well done.

285
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,320
<i>What must Carlos Sainz be thinking?</i>

286
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,800
<i>He had to give up his position
to Lando Norris.</i>

287
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,200
<i>Ferrari are lagging, to say the least.</i>

288
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,280
<i>He's obviously gonna move to the Scuderia.
Can't back out now, can you?</i>

289
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,880
The team let Lando overtake me. So, uh,
I am pretty angry right now.

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,080
I don't really show
a lot of anger and rage,

291
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,720
mainly because
I'm not that kind of character.

292
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,240
At some point, I always end up,
I don't know, throwing a glove

293
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,240
or just a small gesture.

294
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,360
If I do some kind of that,
it shows that I'm really, really angry.

295
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,200
I just, I'm just taking it inside.

296
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,360
- Where am I sitting? There?
- Oh! Damn!

297
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,280
- Just dried his seat for him.
- He's contaminated it.

298
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,800
He's actually just injured me, mate.

299
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,960
Uh, yeah?

300
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,800
Let me see. Can I take care of it?

301
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,840
- Shut up.
- Can I massage it?

302
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Just get to Ferrari already, mate.

303
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,520
In some ways, it's already kinda started,
the little bit of a tail-off,

304
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,560
um, with him obviously going
to Ferrari next year.

305
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,840
Carlos, one. Lando, zero.

306
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,080
Thing is I'm gonna do something to him,
and he's gonna get real...

307
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,320
- I never get angry with you.
- Yeah, you do.

308
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,616
- No, I'm not...
- You do.

309
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,160
There's never hard feelings.

310
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,240
Last year, Carlos and Lando
had this... had this real bromance,

311
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,840
and that's very rare in Formula 1.

312
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,320
This year is very different.

313
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,960
Have you guys missed each other?

314
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,280
- Not at all?
- No.

315
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,640
Yeah, the gloves are off
between those two.

316
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,280
<i>It's the Hungarian Grand Prix.</i>

317
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,800
<i>And it's lights out, and away we go.</i>

318
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,880
<i>Sainz has pitted.</i>

319
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,560
<i>It's an awful stop.
What is going on? He's lost so much time.</i>

320
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,400
- Oh my God.
<i>- Sainz finishes ninth.</i>

321
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,600
<i>That's the checkered flag.
Not quite the race we wanted.</i>

322
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,320
<i>Verstappen gets away well.
Sainz is making a move on Norris.</i>

323
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,760
A lot of vibration on the car.
I don't know why.

324
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,600
<i>Carlos Sainz, and he's got tire problems.</i>

325
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,760
Whoa, puncture. Puncture.

326
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
<i>Sainz's tire's gone.</i>

327
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,000
- Fuck!
- We'll have to box.

328
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,240
Fuck.

329
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,320
<i>Norris is fifth.</i>

330
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,160
- Good race.
<i>- Well done.</i>

331
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,640
<i>What a grandstand finish.
Unbelievable.</i>

332
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,680
I'm starting to get frustrated

333
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,920
because nothing seems to go right
for me at the moment.

334
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,960
<i>Carlos Sainz,
heading out onto the grid.</i>

335
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,960
There's some smoke
coming out of the car.

336
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah. Box, box. Something broke.

337
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,080
Something big.

338
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,920
<i>Carlos, that's, uh, dead.
You can get out.</i>

339
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,080
When you have
that sort of failure,

340
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,440
where you're not even able to compete
or to start a race, um...

341
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,160
<i>It's lights out,
and away we go.</i>

342
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,720
<i>They weren't held for long.
Hamilton, away well.</i>

343
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,320
...it's the biggest disappointment.

344
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,536
- <i>Lando Norris in 11th.</i>
- I feel very down at the moment.

345
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,080
<i>This, the scrap
for the final points place.</i>

346
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
And upset.

347
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,360
I've lost 30 or more points this year.

348
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,680
At the press conference,

349
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,160
they always ask...

350
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,960
They always ask me what car I drive.

351
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:10,840
They say, "Pagani? Porsche? Ferrari?"

352
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,960
"McLaren?"

353
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
"McLaren." And I say, "Golf!"

354
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,120
Every professional athlete needs

355
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,360
their own time.

356
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,160
My family has always been next to me.

357
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,400
It's where I feel the most comfortable.

358
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,320
Come on.
Let's get going quick no?

359
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,160
- Come on.
- It's windy, isn't it?

360
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,920
He doesn't want
to spend much time stretching.

361
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,960
When he's here,
in a way, he's recharging batteries.

362
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,480
You ready?

363
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,400
The life
of the Formula 1 driver is not easy.

364
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,120
Motorsport is like that.
Motorsport is up and down.

365
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,680
And to have somebody you know
you can trust is, uh, super crucial.

366
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,840
Okay.

367
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,840
Terrible!

368
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,080
When things go wrong,

369
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,920
you need to be honest with yourself.

370
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,920
Learn from the bad things,
and if you need to cry, you cry,

371
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,160
but learn, make the mistakes,

372
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,560
trust in your talent, trust in your ideas,
trust the way you want to do things.

373
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
You suddenly start to think
in a different way on a few things,

374
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,440
and then you are changing your approach.

375
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You change as a person, you know,

376
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,040
and then, suddenly,
you make a step in your career.

377
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,240
You must try to analyze,

378
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,480
and then turn the page, fully committed,
fully concentrated in the next race.

379
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,280
I think it's the right approach.

380
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,576
<i>Good morning, everybody.
It's the Italian Grand Prix,</i>

381
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,280
<i>and here we are at Monza.</i>

382
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,920
<i>This is the temple of speed,
and the home of Ferrari.</i>

383
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,960
<i>Speeds today
in excess of 215 miles an hour.</i>

384
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,120
<i>The streets, usually adorned</i>

385
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,920
<i>with thousands
of Ferrari's passionate fans,</i>

386
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,040
<i>or Tifosi,
as they're affectionately called.</i>

387
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,520
<i>This year, mostly watching
from the safety of their own homes.</i>

388
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,520
<i>You can see how passionate they are.</i>

389
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,720
<i>There's a hotel close to the track
a lot of drivers stay at.</i>

390
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,680
<i>You can see, there was evidence
of a lot of them standing there</i>

391
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,440
<i>trying to get a glimpse of their heroes.</i>

392
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Hey, guys.

393
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,880
<i>Grazie.</i>

394
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,840
See you there.

395
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,240
Ooh, Tifosi!

396
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,760
Wave at them.

397
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,600
Ferrari is known
for having that extra pressure.

398
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,120
It's nearly like a religion here in Italy.

399
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,400
We're gonna have a lot of time
and a lot of opportunities.

400
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,760
Thank you so much.

401
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,840
Tifosi, the media, everyone
is expecting Ferrari to be winning.

402
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,440
If they're not winning, there's pressure.

403
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,200
- <i>Buongiorno.</i>
- Ciao.

404
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,680
Go ahead.

405
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,560
I think that adds
a bit more pressure to the drivers.

406
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,000
Ferrari! Ferrari! Ferrari!

407
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,040
In Monza,

408
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,640
I think,
if you have any affiliation with Ferrari,

409
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,360
whether you're a current driver
or going to be there,

410
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,000
there's probably, uh,
an increased intensity to it.

411
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,960
- Carlos!
- Hi.

412
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,360
Carlos probably feels
a little bit of the pressure.

413
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,760
He's soon gonna be a Ferrari driver,
so that puts a big spotlight on you.

414
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,160
But, uh, for sure,
Lando's performance this year,

415
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,560
and, uh, Carlos's bad luck along the way,

416
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,320
won't be, uh, putting him
in the happiest of moods at all times.

417
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,920
- Macchiato. There's the tea.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

418
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,760
So, compared to Lando,
this was his fastest through turn one,

419
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,960
compared to our fastest from turn one.

420
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,440
You can see he's challenging the fronts
just as much in this phase.

421
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,520
But his style is that he won't extend
holding the brake here.

422
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,840
Because he always just programs himself to
come off the brakes the same each corner.

423
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,320
It's just the subtle difference
in that he's got the tow here.

424
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,840
You've not quite got it.

425
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,640
We're not asking you
to adopt Lando's approach to the braking.

426
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,120
- It's how we optimize your approach.
- Yeah.

427
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,320
I think any time things don't go your way
for a driver, you get disappointed.

428
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,800
It's a... It's a very emotional,
passionate, uh, sport.

429
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,040
There's times
the drivers make some mistakes.

430
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,120
My father taught me
to be hard-working,

431
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,560
to have the right attitude.

432
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,280
Without hard work, dedication,

433
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,120
it's pretty much impossible
to get to where you want.

434
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,880
Carlos desperately needs
a good race.

435
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,120
He knows the Tifosi will welcome him
with open arms

436
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,960
if he can have a great race in Italy.

437
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,320
Every time you arrive to a track,

438
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,040
you know you are gonna be
part of their family next year.

439
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,400
That feeling is difficult to explain.

440
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,520
And it's part of why I'm so excited
about going to Ferrari.

441
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,560
All 20 drivers on the grid
have a similar level of talent that I do.

442
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,880
So there's only two things then that
you can control, which is your fitness,

443
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,040
but also be as mentally well-prepared
and self-confident as you can.

444
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,680
- <i>You were fastest last lap.</i>
- Copy.

445
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,880
<i>Carlos Sainz is steaming along.</i>

446
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,200
<i>How quickly can he get through the pack?</i>

447
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,360
<i>Carlos Sainz is looking
to make up a place around the outside.</i>

448
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Come on!

449
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,360
<i>Nice job.</i>

450
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,480
<i>These key overtakes
could be critical for the podium,</i>

451
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,680
<i>or even the win.</i>

452
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,800
Carlos, you can be patient with Räikkönen.
You can be patient.

453
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,280
<i>Carlos Sainz
is going for it with Kimi Räikkönen,</i>

454
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,160
<i>who gives him enough space,
and Sainz moves up into second place!</i>

455
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,360
<i>This is a very strong position for McLaren
as it stands at the moment.</i>

456
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,480
<i>Sebastian Vettel down in 17th,</i>

457
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,640
<i>and under pressure from George Russell.</i>

458
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,960
<i>The Ferraris
are going a little bit backwards now.</i>

459
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,520
<i>And Sebastian Vettel goes
straight through the polystyrene blocks.</i>

460
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,040
Brake line exploded.

461
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,160
<i>Oh dear, oh dear.</i>

462
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,200
<i>Just going from bad to worse.</i>

463
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,040
<i>What a dismal season
poor old Seb is having.</i>

464
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,120
<i>That's Charles Leclerc!</i>

465
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,720
<i>And that is a very big accident.</i>

466
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,120
<i>My goodness, Ferrari. What is going on?</i>

467
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,640
<i>What a horrible, horrible
Italian Grand Prix for the Scuderia.</i>

468
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,520
How tight
is that Ferrari contract?

469
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,840
<i>Looking like a brilliant
afternoon if you're a McLaren fan.</i>

470
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,400
<i>Carlos, this is good. Pace is good.</i>

471
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,800
Guys, we could get both cars on
the podium, so let's get working together.

472
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,520
<i>Carlos Sainz departs the McLaren team</i>

473
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,880
<i>to go and join Ferrari.</i>

474
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,360
<i>How he would love to go to the Scuderia
as a race winner.</i>

475
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,720
He has a lot of pace.

476
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,840
<i>The gap is 4.3.
This is still on. This is still on.</i>

477
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,200
Okay, okay, okay.

478
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,800
<i>Carlos Sainz is now charging him down.</i>

479
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,520
We need to be patient. Come on.

480
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,840
They will get there.

481
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,040
<i>Carlos Sainz,
he's got his dad's winning mentality.</i>

482
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,480
<i>You can do this, mate.
Keep your head cool.</i>

483
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,320
I want this win, Tom.

484
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,680
He's fucking fast. Come on.

485
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
<i>Five laps to go. Five laps.</i>

486
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,640
<i>Gap, 2.8.</i>

487
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,680
Gap every lap.

488
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,600
<i>Copy, 1.7.</i>

489
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Woo!

490
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,520
<i>Sainz is tantalizingly close now.</i>

491
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Come on!

492
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,520
<i>Three laps to go, Carlos.
Maximum focus now.</i>

493
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,960
<i>- No mistakes.
- </i>Copy.

494
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,576
- C'mon!
- Go on!

495
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,000
Come on!

496
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,960
<i>It is last lap shenanigans here at Monza.</i>

497
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,400
- Come on!
- Go on, lad!

498
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,080
<i>We've got DRS
onboard the McLaren. It'll be very close.</i>

499
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,240
Jesus Christ! Come on!

500
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,240
<i>It's going all the way down to the wire.</i>

501
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,960
<i>And look at that!
Sliding through the Ascari chicane.</i>

502
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,240
<i>It's like watching his father
doing rallying,</i>

503
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,880
<i>but we're watching Carlos Sainz
in Formula 1.</i>

504
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,000
<i>He's given it absolutely everything.</i>

505
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,800
<i>Carlos Sainz comes home
for second place,</i>

506
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,600
<i>and what a great fight he gave.</i>

507
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
<i>P2, buddy.</i>

508
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,200
<i>Great work, mate. Great work.</i>

509
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,520
<i>I am a big fan of your work.</i>

510
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
Oh!

511
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,400
Thank you, guys.
We tried our best, I think.

512
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,440
Thank you. Amazing weekend.

513
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,760
I'm actually very, very happy, and...

514
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,760
Um, yeah, particularly proud
of what I have achieved.

515
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,160
I think there is a part of Carlos

516
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,560
that probably
would love to stay at McLaren.

517
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,440
<i>In second place, Carlos Sainz!</i>

518
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,520
Ferrari, last year,
they were still podium contenders.

519
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,800
Now, you would say,
in some of the races, they've been

520
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,760
seventh-best team.

521
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,240
And you would say
it's one of the worst decisions

522
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,600
you could possibly make.

523
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,280
He probably is regretting it.

524
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,160
Um, even if he says he's not,
he probably is.

525
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,320
Already starting to feel
what it's gonna be like next year,

526
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,200
and that is a feeling that no one's
gonna be able to take away from me.

527
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,120
Going to Ferrari, it's something that...
It's impossible to regret.

528
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,040
How much are you gonna miss him
when he moves to Ferrari next year?

529
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,080
Say it. Yes, you're gonna miss me.
Say it now.

530
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,080
- You can't force me to say it.
- Yeah. Say it.

531
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,080
When I'm passing him on the racetrack,
I can wave at him.

532
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,120
Can't find a team.

533
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,680
- Everyone is booked?
- Yeah.

534
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,416
<i>Big weekend
for many drivers who come into this race</i>

535
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,800
<i>uncertain of their futures.</i>

536
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,040
They say sportsmen die twice.
Once when you lose your career...

537
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,040
- Will you be here next year?
- Don't know.

538
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,880
It's bad luck.

539
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,000
...and once at the actual end.

540
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,680
<i>There's a big incident. Red flag.</i>

541
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,120
- <i>Who is it?
- Has he got out?</i>

542
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,440
<i>A very, very nasty crash.</i>
