你有没有遇到多尔蒂警官
You haven't, by chance, seen Officer Dougherty?

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,760
我们昨晚约好一起吃晚饭的
We were... supposed to have dinner last night.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,530
他没来  这也不奇怪
He didn't show-- no surprise--

5

但今天他也没来上班

布鲁斯  你父亲是个真正清心寡欲之人
Bruce, your father was a true Stoic.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,120
他最好的一面不为人所知
He kept his best self hidden.

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,670
你父亲是个好人
Your father was a good man.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,870
但好人也有秘密
But even good men have secrets.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,570
你很顽固  詹姆斯  跟你父亲一样
You have a hard head, James, just like your father.

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,300
哥谭现在是在刀口上
Gotham is on a knife edge.

17
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,720
但我绝不会束手旁观看着它崩溃
But I won't let it fall apart without a fight.

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,310
刚刚得到消息  法尔科内城里
Just got wind of three separate attacks

19
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,890
三处不同地点的生意遭到袭击

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,620
是马罗尼干的

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,100
枪战开始了

早上好  孩子们
Good morning, child.

30
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,430
我们不是孩子
We ain't children,

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,810
而且...现在也不是早上
and... it ain't morning.

32
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,620
很快就是了
Oh, it will be soon.

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,790
崭新的一天
A brand-new day.

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,680
两周后

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,130
黑帮战争在哥谭市愈演愈烈
The gang war rages on here in Gotham.

36
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,390
没人知道是什么引发了这场血腥的地盘大战
No one knows what set this bloody turf war off,

37
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,500
但大家普遍认为这是长久以来
but it is commonly believed to be the result

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,940
萨尔维多・马罗尼和卡麦・法尔科内的
of the longtime power struggle between Salvatore Maroni

39
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,940
权力之争造成的
and Carmine Falcone.

40
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,220
作为宿敌  这两位经常...
Longtime enemies, these men have often come to blows...

41
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,510
还在秘密是不是  少爷
Still looking for secrets, are we, sir?

42
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,760
还是只是在砸东西
Or just breaking stuff?

43
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,930
找秘密
Secrets.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,700
这样好吗
I don't know.

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,500
整座城市都疯掉了
Whole city's going doolally around us.

46
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,570
街头正在打仗
I mean, there's a bloody war on the streets...

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,950
但你却在这里操心你的老父亲
and you're in here worrying about your poor old dad.

48
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,710
的确
Yes, I am.

49
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,150
假如你父亲真有不为人知的生活
If your father had a secret life--

50
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,880
容我说一句  他没有
which I hasten to add, he didn't--

51
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,400
那我肯定会知道的  是不是
I'd know about it, wouldn't I?

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,380
他是个稳重勤勉的人
A sober, diligent man he was.

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,650
从不出去寻欢作乐
Never out gallivanting.

54
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,570
每晚都回家  准时准点
Home every night, like clockwork,

55
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,730
就在这间屋子里工作
working, in this very room.

56
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,980
是的  我记得
Yes, I remember.

57
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,740
他工作的时候不许我去吵他
I wasn't allowed to disturb him while he was working.

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,300
任何人都不许
Nobody was.

59
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,890
古典乐...
Classical music...

60
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,690
他会放好几个小时
he would play for hours.

61
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,480
没错
That's right.

62
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,540
妈妈和我会读书或者玩棋类游戏
Mom and I would read books or play board games

63
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,610
直到他工作完
until he was done.

64
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,360
我记得
I remember.

65
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,080
我曾试图溜进去看他
I tried to sneak in to see him,

66
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,390
但门是锁着的
but the door was locked.

67
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,020
当时门是不是总是锁着的  阿尔弗雷德
Was the door always locked, Alfred?

68
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,860
是的  我想是的  在他工作的时候
Yeah, well, I suppose so, when he was working.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,830
但是为什么呢
Why, though?

70
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,470
为什么要锁门
Why lock the door?

71
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,390
装门就是用来锁的  是不是
That's what doors are for, isn't it?

72
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,620
就在这里
It's in here.

73
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,610
就在这间房子里
It's in this room.

74
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,920
我父亲的秘密  就在这间房子里
My father's secret, it's in this room.

75
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,020
我知道
I know it.

76
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,330
我知道
I know it!

77
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,670
你好呀  小姑娘
Hello, young lady.

78
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,060
我喜欢你的样子
I like your style.

79
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,620
哥谭
第一季第二十二集[季终]

80
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,050
把法尔科内的人关在一间牢房里
Hey, put Falcone's guys in one cell,

81
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,560
马罗尼的关在另一间
and Maroni's in another.

82
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,110
进去
Get in there!

83
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,220
抓住他
Get him!

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,000
进去吧
Get in there!

85
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,640
外面
Outside!

86
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,470
是卡茨警官吧
Officer Katz, right?

87
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,930
是  长官  格里芬・卡茨
Yes, sir, Katz, Griffin.

88
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,720
提个建议  卡茨
Word of advice, Katz.

89
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,140
我是注定要完蛋的人
I'm a dead duck around here.

90
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,920
黑帮战争一冷却下来
Brass are gonna fire me just as soon as

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,330
上头就会马上开除我
this gang war cools off.

92
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,670
所以别朝我敬礼
So don't salute me.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,670
只会显得你傻
Makes you look like a rube.

94
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,570
-警探  -汤普金斯医生
- Detective. - Dr. Thompkins.

95
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,310
吉姆

没错  这是你最后一次检查了
You are. This is your last checkup.

你身体上的伤已经痊愈
You are all healed physically.

103
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,710
但你需要接受心理创伤治疗
But you need to get some trauma counseling.

104
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,250
医生  我很开心
Doc, I'm happy.

所以  吉姆  我走之前
Which is why, Jim, I didn't want to leave

107
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,190
想正式向你道谢
without saying thank you properly.

108
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,720
谢谢你救了我的命
Thank you for saving my life.

能救你我很高兴
I was glad to do it.

110
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,990
基恩小姐
Miss Kean...

111
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,510
心理创伤治疗  你真的很需要
trauma counseling, like, yesterday.

112
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,890
我可以推荐几个人给你
I have several recommendations for you.

113
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,930
-医生  真的  我很好  -你一点也不好
- Really, Doc, I am fine. - You're not fine.

114
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,160
你经历了那些事  不可能会好
After what you've been through, nobody would be fine.

115
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,290
好啊  如果你为我治疗就行
Fine. If you will be my counselor.

116
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,490
还要去我家会诊
And we do it at my place.

117
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,950
不行  我接受过创伤治疗训练
No. I have some trauma training,

118
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,770
但这不是我的专长
but it's not my area of focus.

119
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,920
我喜欢你
I like you.

120
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,850
我可以对你敞开话匣
Hey, I can talk to you.

121
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,270
求你了
Please?

122
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,020
好吧
Okay.

123
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,040
说定了
Deal.

谢谢你
Thank you.

125
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,350
好了  给你们最后一次警告
All right, last warning to all of you!

126
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,890
别放了那家伙
Don't free that guy!

127
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,290
吉姆  你看新闻了吗
Hey, Jim, did you hear the news?

128
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,710
法尔科内阁下遭暗杀了

法尔科20分钟前遭暗杀了

131
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,860
马罗尼的人炸掉了他的车

132
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,080

133
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,600
不过他也快死了
but he'll be dead soon enough.

134
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,590
听着  艾森说市政府和权贵都默许了暗杀
Listen, Essen said City Hall and the bigwigs okayed the hit.

135
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,730
他们转向支持马罗尼了
They switched their support to Maroni.

136
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,240
马罗尼  那个莽人
Maroni? That hothead?

137
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,840
他们觉得他能掌管这城市吗
They think he can run this city?

138
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,830
总得有人倒台
Someone had to go.

139
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,600
这场战争损害了生意
This war has been bad for business.

140
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,890
你好
Hello?

141

Yes, I imagine so.

148
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,740
不能待太久
Mustn't stay long.

149
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,970
但是  我如果不亲自跟你道别
But... I knew I'd regret it if I didn't say

150
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,680
我一定会后悔的
good-bye to you in person.

151
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,960
是我干的  老朋友
It was me, old friend.

152
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,710
是我害了你
I did this to you.

153
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,890
我挑起了战争
I started the war.

154
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,780
从见到你的第一天起  我就开始筹划你的结局
From the day I met you, I was planning your end.

155
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,150
很遗憾要在这种
I'm sorry it has to be in this...

156
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,000
肮脏的小地方结束  但是...
squalid little corner, but...

157
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,930
这就是人生
...c'est la vie.

158
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,460
为什么
Why?

159
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,040
不是针对你  我向你保证  先生
Nothing personal, I assure you, sir.

160
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,170
你一直是位睿智的导师
You have been a wise mentor

161
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,740
还是位好朋友
and a good friend,

162
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,950
但是
but...

163
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,800
生意总得摆在第一位
business must come first.

164
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,170
我要取代你的位置  老头
I'm gonna take your place, old man.

165
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,950
我要成为哥谭之王
And I'm gonna be the King of Gotham.

166
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,660
你
You?

167
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,130
绝不可能
Never.

168
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,150
你会下地狱的
You're going to burn in Hell.

169
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,580
我确实有这担忧
I do worry about that.

170
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,720
不过你先请了
But you first,

171
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,350
老朋友
old friend.

172
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,750
你先
You first.

173
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,460
不许动
Nobody move!

174
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,780
走开
Walk away!

175
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,760
闭嘴
Shut up.

176
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,170
你们俩都因为谋杀未遂被捕了
You're both under arrest for attempted murder.

177
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,600
你没听说吗
Didn't you hear?

178
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,070
法尔科内已经正式下台了
Falcone is out by official decree.

179
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,450
大家都同意了
Everyone agreed.

180
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,630
我听说了
I heard.

181
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,920
那放了我吧  吉姆
So, release me, Jim.

182
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,960
站在赢家这边
Get on the winning side.

183
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,780
什么赢家
Winning side, my ass.

184
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,870
马罗尼就是个白痴  他替代不了我
Maroni's a fool. He can't replace me.

185
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,500
他上台会有不计其数的人反对他
A thousand rivals will jump up to challenge him.

186
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,940
会引起一片混战
There'll be civil war.

187
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,360
如果我现在死  哥谭就会分崩离析
If I die now, Gotham falls apart.

188
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,390
我同意  那你能扭转局势吗
I agree, but can you turn things around?

189
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,570
你能夺回控制权吗
Can you take back control?

190
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,600
当然
Of course.

191
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,600
只要去我的安全屋躲两天
Two days at my safe house.

192
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,540
我需要两天布置行动
I need two days to make some moves,

193
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,110
然后我就能把马罗尼和那些叛徒扒皮抽筋
and I'll skin Maroni and those disloyal scum like rabbits.

194
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,920
醒醒吧  拿破仑大人
Wake up, Napoleon!

195
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,650
马罗尼的人马上
Maroni's louts are minutes away

196
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,700
就要赶到这里  割断你的喉咙
from coming here and cutting your throat,

197
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,470
问题是  吉姆  他们也
and the thing is, Jim, they aren't very fond

198
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,500
不是很喜欢我  所以说真的
of me, either, so, seriously,

199
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,670
你得赶紧放开我  吉姆
you need to uncuff me-- Jim?!

200
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,230
吉姆  你跑哪里去了
Jim, where the hell'd you run off to?

201
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,080
哈维
Harv,

202
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,970
我和法尔科内在医院
I'm in the hospital with Falcone.

203
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,150
这里一个人都没有
There's nobody here.

204
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,370
当然不会有  你跑那干什么去了
No kidding. What the hell are you doing there?

205
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,330
赶紧出来
You gotta get out now.

206
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,350
他们肯定会回去解决他的
They'll be coming back to finish him off.

207
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,990
我知道  马上就要到了
Yeah. Any moment now.

208
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,600
除非我先救他出去
Unless I get him out of here.

209
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,370
吉姆  吉姆  吉姆
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

210
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,530
我需要你帮忙
I could use some help.

211
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,750
没门  你是疯了吗
No way. Are you nuts?

212
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,380
他是坏人  但是坏人里最好的一个了
He's a bad man, but he's the best bad man we got.

213
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,180
如果法尔科内失去控制权
If Falcone loses control,

214
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,560
马罗尼太疯狂  控制不了哥谭
Maroni's too wild to run Gotham.

215
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,610
到时会一片混乱
There'll be anarchy.

216
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,260
有可能
Yeah, probably,

217
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,180
但法尔科内已经失去控制权了
but Falcone already lost control.

218
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,700
他会夺回来的
And he'll get it back.

219
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,450
你就是因为芭芭拉的事头脑不清楚
Listen, you're all twisted over what happened to Barbara.

220
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,160
你失去理智了
You're not thinking straight.

221
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,590
是啊  也许吧
Yeah. Maybe.

222
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,760
但反正我在这儿也混不下去了
But I'm done in this town anyhow.

223
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,170
还怕失去什么呢
What do I have to lose?

224
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,330
你的小命
Your life.

225
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,590
小命也不要了吗
How 'bout your life?

226
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,810
你在这里做什么
What the hell are you doing here?

227
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,010
不是跟你们都说好了吗
I thought the fix was in with you guys.

228
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,810
你能走路吗
Can you walk?

229
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,740
-勉强  -先把你弄出去
- If I have to. - Let's get you out of here--

230
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,740
我带你去你的安全屋
I'll take you to your safe house.

231
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,740
吉姆  我的朋友
Jim, my friend,

232
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,380
这么做是个天大的错误
you are making a terrible mistake.

233
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,880
我这么做是为了哥谭
I'm doing this for the city,

234
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,910
不是为了你
not you.

235
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,740
你是糟糕选择里最好的一个
You're the least worst option.

236
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,830
如果我觉得你夺不回控制权
If I didn't think you could take back control,

237
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,100
也不会救你
I'd let you die.

238
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,940
得先把话说清楚
Just so we're clear.

239
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,080
很清楚
We're clear.

240
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,400
你不能丢下我不管
You can't leave me here.

241
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,490
马罗尼的人会杀了我的
Maroni's men will kill me!

242
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,450
很可能
Possible.

243
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,880
不  不行  你逮捕了我们
No. No, you-you arrested us.

244
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,950
我们是你的责任
We are in your custody.

245
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,610
那倒是
That's true.

246
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,780
你欠我个人情  吉姆
You owe me a favor, Jim.

247
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,380
你欠我的
You owe me!

248
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,150
该死
Damn it.

249
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,220
詹姆斯・戈登
James Gordon!

250
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,100
戈登警探
Detective Gordon!

251
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,250
别杀他们
Don't kill 'em.

252
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,700
早安啊  各位
Morning, fellas.

253
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,610
有什么能帮你们的
What can I help you with?

254
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,910
当然  戈登
Yes, Gordon.

255
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,630
你又在错误的时间出现在错误的地点
As usual, wrong place, wrong time.

256
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,990
现在赶紧走
Go. Now.

257
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,520
干吗  让这些人杀掉卡麦・法尔科内吗
Why? So these men can kill Carmine Falcone?

258
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,500
这我不清楚
I have no knowledge of that.

259
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,780
快走
Go.

260
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,400
这是命令
That's an order.

261
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,800
你真是个耻辱  洛布
You're a disgrace, Loeb.

262
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,490
希望很快能看到你被绳之以法
I hope to see you behind bars very soon.

263
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,650
要么就横尸街头
Or dead.

264
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,480
都行
Whichever.

265
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,760
希望
Hope.

266
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,840
是给失败者的...
It's for losers...

267
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,310
吉姆
Jim.

268
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,750
留给你们了
He's all yours!

269
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,230
杀了他
Get him!

270
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,360
快  快
Move, move, move, move.

271
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,590
吉姆  吉姆  别开枪  是我
Jim! Jim! Don't shoot! It's me!

272
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,110
赶紧走吧  地下室有救护车
We gotta go-- There are ambulances in the basement.

273
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,060
你救的人呢
Where's your man?

274
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,410
这个嘛
About that.

275
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,910
咱们还得带上企鹅和吉尔兹
We got to take Penguin and Gilzean, too.

276
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,920
企鹅和吉尔兹
Penguin and Gilzean?

277
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,210
我以谋杀未遂罪逮捕了他们
I arrested 'em for attempted murder.

278
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,660
他们现在受我监管
They're in my custody.

279
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,820
我都不想跟你争了
I don't even want to argue with you.

280
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,590
来吧  咱们走  赶紧
Come on! Let's go! Go!

281
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,080
汤米  汤米
Tommy... Tommy!

282
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,540
老大  老大  小心
Boss! Boss! Look out!

283
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,610
趴下
Get down!

284
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,610
该死
Damn it.

285
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,950
我们究竟在找什么  布鲁斯少爷
What exactly are we looking for, Master Bruce?

286
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,850
等我找到了  就知道了
When I find it, I'll know.

287
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,690
没人知道这地方  对吧
Nobody knows about this place, right? Nobody?

288
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,080
没人  知道这地方的人都死了
Nobody. Anybody who did is dead.

289
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,630
这里很安全
We'll be safe here.

290
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,630
你们好啊
Hello.

291
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,030
干什么呢
What's up?

292
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,940
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

293
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,360
这太令人震惊了
It's astonishing.

294
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,120
我有时都能把自己吓一跳
Sometimes I astonish myself.

295
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,430
我感觉
I feel like, uh,

296
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,380
这一切像一场梦
this is all a dream,

297
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,030
很快就会醒来
and I'm gonna wake up soon.

298
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,330
芭芭拉
Barbara,

299
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,790
你遭到绑架
you were abducted.

300
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,970
眼看着父母被杀
Your parents were killed in front of you.

301
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,630
没错  那是真的
Yeah. Yeah, that's real.

302
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,560
我说的是现在
I'm talking about this. Now. This...

303
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,300
现在是一场梦
This is the dream.

304
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,630
我会醒来
I'm gonna wake up

305
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,170
然后...
and...

306
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,820
发现他还活着...
he's still alive...

307
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,610
他会来找我
and he's coming for me.

308
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,910
我以为你死了
I thought for sure you were dead.

309
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,190
让我好好看看你
Let me look at you.

310
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,930
菲什
Fish?

311
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,390
真的是你吗
Is it real... It's really you?

312
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,450
是我  布奇  我回家了
It's... it's me, Butch. I'm home.

313
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,540
可怜的宝贝  他们对你干了什么
My poor baby. What did they do to you?

314
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,720
不是什么好事
Nothing good.

315
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,910
是他  老大
It's him, boss.

316
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,040
马罗尼阁下
Don Maroni.

317
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,450
没错
Yes.

318
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,110
毫发无伤
Alive and well.

319
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,410
这就说来话长了
That's a long story.

320
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,290
我们要谈谈
We need to talk.

321
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,220
我手上有你想要的东西
I have something you want.

322
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,450
他们没找到我的小刀
They didn't find my knife.

323
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,150
那就有救了
So we're saved then.

324
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,220
在我袜子里
It's in my sock.

325
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,990
如果你有机会  拉几个垫背的
If you get the chance, take some of them with us.

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,950
我尽量
I'll try.

327
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,570
你好啊
Hey, you.

328
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,200
塞琳娜  你在这儿干什么
Selina, what are you doing here?

329
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,620
就待着
Chillin'.

330
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,900
你呢
How 'bout you?

331
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,120
被绑住了
Kind of jammed up.

332
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,640
是啊
Yeah.

333
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,690
真是太糟了
That's too bad.

334
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,100
你这哑谜是"求救"的意思吗
That's mime for "Help us out here."

335
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,520
你要我毁掉最酷的一单活儿
And totally blow the coolest gig ever

336
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,370
就因为我们算是认识吗
just because we kinda, sorta know each other?

337
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,120
是吗
Right?

338
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,200
好啊  小伙子们
Hello, fellas.

339
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
卡麦
Carmine.

340
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
企鹅
Penguin.

341
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,360
没什么想说的吗
Nothing to share?

342
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,580
我倒是有件事
Well, I have a little something.

343
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,880
我刚和马罗尼达成了一桩不错的交易
I just made a sweet deal with Maroni.

344
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,180
他和我说  我可以拿回我所有的地盘
He just told me I could have all my territories back,

345
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,830
作为交换  我只要
and all I have to do in return...

346
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,720
把卡麦的脑袋拿给他
is give him Carmine's head.

347
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,540
菲什  我要去躺会儿
Uh, Fish, I-I need to go lie down.

348
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,670
你都对那可怜人干了什么  你这虐待狂
What did you do to that poor soul, you sadist?

349
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,410
我向你保证
I assure you...

350
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,260
你会
You will die

351
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,490
为布奇的事  慢慢地  痛苦地死去
a slow, painful death on account of Butch.

352
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,960
你也一样  卡麦
You, too, Carmine.

353
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,660
而你
You...

354
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,710
给你个痛快的
We'll keep it simple.

355
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:33,800
你呢
And you?

356
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,500
你不会有事
We're cool.

357
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,180
有任何疑问吗
Any questions?

358
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,630
你想怎么杀他们
How you gonna kill 'em?

359
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,940
我喜欢这丫头
I love this girl.

360
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,370
杰森看穿了我
Jason saw right through me.

361
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,660
他一见面就了解了我
He knew me instantly.

362
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,620
就好像我一丝不挂
Like I was naked.

363
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,510
很吓人
It was scary...

364
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,650
也令人兴奋
but thrilling.

365
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,730
而且
And...

366
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,850
说起来
aren't...

367
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,270
那些好男人不是都有些吓人吗
all the best guys a little scary?

368
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,920
我们第一次约会时  我就很怕吉姆・戈登
I was way more scared of Jim Gordon the first date we went on.

369
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,470
那么孔武有力
So butch and... stern.

370
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,570
那种男人通常都是暴脾气
That type, they-they often have a bad temper.

371
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,230
但吉姆是个好人
But Jim was a sweetie.

372
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,790
从未动过我一根手指
Never laid a finger on me.

373
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,930
挺令人惊讶的
It was kind of surprising.

374
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,790
他打过你吗
Does he ever hit you?

375
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,040
我  没有  为什么
Me? No. Why?

376
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,400
他为什么会打人呢
Wh-Why would he hit anyone?

377
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,360
怎么会打女人呢
Any woman?

378
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,880
你懂的
You know.

379
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,350
出于激情
Out of passion.

380
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,700
对不起  我并不是要窥探什么
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry.

381
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,580
只是我听说你和吉姆在约会
Only I heard you and Jim were dating.

382
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,900
没有
No.

383
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,740
是的  我们是约过几次
Y-Yes, we've been on a few dates.

384
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,560
对不起  我不知道你已经知道了
I'm sorry, I didn't think that you knew.

385
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,460
如果你觉得不舒服的话
If that makes you uncomfortable in any way...

386
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,590
没有  别傻了
No. Don't be silly.

387
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,930
我为你高兴
I, uh... I'm happy for you.

388
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,570
他真的是个好人
He's one of the good guys.

389
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,210
是啊
Yeah, he is.

390
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,930
饿了吗
Hey, you hungry?

391
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,010
他来了
So, there he is.

392
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,020
菲什  你个神秘  疯狂  美丽的小杀手
Fish, you mysterious, crazy, gorgeous killer, you.

393
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,290
爱死你了
I love ya.

394
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:41,970
抱一个
Come here.

395
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,440
这真是...
This...

396
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,220
真是太美好了
this is delicious.

397
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,240
终于啊
Finally.

398
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,470
你命真硬  老家伙
You're hard to kill, old man.

399
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,360
不
No.

400
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,390
是你的人太次了
Your people are second-rate.

401
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,310
穆尼女士  我有几句话要说
Miss Mooney, if I may, a brief word.

402
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,490
我知道我一定没命了
I know my life is forfeit.

403
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:06,900
所以我不是为自己  我是为了你
I speak not for my sake, but yours.

404
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,920
因为毕竟
Because... after all,

405
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,380
我还是爱你  敬重你的
I still love and respect you.

406
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,360
杀我无所谓
Kill me if you must,

407
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,600
但请留法尔科内一命
but keep Falcone alive.

408
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,390
他一死  你对马罗尼来说就毫无用处了
As soon as he's dead, Maroni has no use for you.

409
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,240
你就是个威胁  他会杀了你的
You are simply a threat. He will kill you.

410
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,120
是吗
You think?

411
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,410
他干吗要容下一山二虎
Why would he need another boss in town?

412
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,500
另一个对手
Another rival?

413
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,580
这你就错了  机灵鬼
That's where you're wrong, smart guy.

414
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,970
她不是对手
She's not a rival,

415
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,660
因为她不是老大
because she's not a boss.

416
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,200
她是二把手
She's an underboss.

417
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,860
二把手听命于人
An underboss takes orders.

418
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,640
而我不
I don't take orders.

419
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,670
我知道  我们没事
I know that. We're cool.

420
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,890
放松
Relax.

421
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,680
我很放松
I'm relaxed.

422
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,510
我觉得你没有  美女
I don't think you are, babes.

423
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,840
别叫我美女
Please don't call me babes.

424
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,710
看见没
You see?

425
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,680
还是紧张
Not relaxed.

426
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,980
美女  不是吧
Babes? Really?

427
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,250
这只是表示亲热
It's a term of endearment.

428
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,220
表示我喜欢你
It means I like you.

429
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,060
好吧
Fine.

430
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,820
我说错话了
I misspoke.

431
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,270
你不是二把手  你不是谁的"美女"
You're not an underboss and you're not a babe.

432
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,160
你自己说你是什么吧
You tell me what you are.

433
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,840
萨尔  我们是
What we are, Sal...

434
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,890
伙伴
...are partners.

435
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,280
随你吧
Whatever you want.

436
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,850
伙伴
Partners.

437
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,970
我是一号伙伴
I'm partner number one,

438
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,310
你是二号伙伴
and you're partner number two.

439
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,190
就是这样  对吧
That's the deal, right?

440
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,410
我是一号
I'm number one...

441
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,440
你是...
and you are...?

442
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,210
二号
Number two.

443
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,620
这就对啦
There you go.

444
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,000
简单的算术
Simple math.

445
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,060
一号  二号  美女  抱歉
One, two, babes. Oops. Sorry.

446
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,170
最后一次  我保证
That's the last time. I swear.

447
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,110
伙计们
Guys!

448
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,770
你们感受到这气氛了吗
Can you feel the buzz in the air?

449
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,180
这是胜利的气氛
That's victory.

450
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,620
是救赎  是力量
Redemption. Power!

451
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,040
等这老头一死  新的一天就将到来
When this old man dies, a new day begins.

452
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,300
我们将统治哥谭
We will rule Gotham.

453
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,480
我们将建立新朝代
We are building a dynasty.

454
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:22,070
我们将让这座城市唯命是从
We will whip this town like a rented mule.

455
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,550
是吧  美女
Right, babes?

456
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,220
别激动
Oh-ho, just... all right, relax.

457
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,360
我逗你玩呢
I'm kidding you.

458
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,410
不过  说真的
Guys, no, seriously.

459
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,390
别叫她"美女"
Don't call her "babes."

460
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,390
还是"亲亲"什么的
Or "toots" or what have you.

461
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,690
这是女权问题
It's a woman's lib thing.

462
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,080
我很放松
I am relaxed.

463
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:02,980
快走
Let's go!

464
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,840
芭芭拉  我们一直在兜圈子
Barbara, we've been circling around the subject,

465
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,460
但还没真正谈及发生在你身上的事
but haven't talked about what actually happened to you;

466
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,060
你经受的遭遇
wh-what was done to you.

467
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,690
小莱
Lee...

468
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,720
你是个好人
you're a nice lady.

469
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,770
我可以谈那些
I could go there,

470
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,580
但你恐怕不会想听的
but I'm not sure you want to go there with me.

471
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,230
别担心我
Don't worry about me.

472
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,100
吉姆对你说过我爱你吗
Has Jim told you he loves you?

473
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,610
-芭芭拉  -公平点
- Barbara... - Fair is fair.

474
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,800
我都把小秘密告诉你了
I'm telling you all my little secrets.

475
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,460
他还没说过
No, he hasn't.

476
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,590
但他会说的  对吧
But he will, though, won't he?

477
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,510
你觉得那一天要来了吗
You can feel it coming?

478
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,840
看看你啊
I mean, come on, look at you.

479
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,560
你又美丽  又聪慧  他当然爱你了
You're gorgeous and smart-- of course he loves you.

480
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,570
你爱他吗
Do you love him?

481
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,610
芭芭拉
Barbara...

482
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,150
告诉我到底发生了什么
Tell me what happened.

483
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,810
如果我们能冲到第七大道不被菲什的人发现
If we can get to 7th Avenue without being spotted by Fisher's people,

484
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,850
我们就可以安全回家了
we're home free.

485
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,020
-然后呢  -找个安全的地方  重新部署
- Then what? - We find a safe place, regroup.

486
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,270
马罗尼的死是你的运气
Maroni's death is a lucky break for you.

487
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,540
这口气真像个黑手党
Spoken like a true mafioso.

488
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,840
你说了  你是最不糟糕的选择
You're the least worst option, like you said.

489
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,470
没有了你  哥谭会分崩离析
Without you, the city falls apart.

490
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,090
是啊  我是说过  也可能真是这样
Yes, I said that, and it might be true,

491
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,200
但今天真的很漫长
but this has been a long day

492
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,150
我也有充足的时间
and I've had a long time

493
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,100
审视我所创造出来的世界
to look at this world I've created.

494
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,200
我不再干这些事了  我退出
I'm done with this business. I'm out.

495
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,410
我在南边有个可以隐退的地方
I've got a place down south I can go to.

496
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,730
对不起
I'm sorry.

497
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,610
对不起
You're sorry?

498
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:51,000
我知道  我让你失望了
I know. I'm letting you down.

499
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,220
我让哥谭失望了  我知道
I'm letting the city down. I know.

500
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,040
我听到了动静
Hey, I heard something.

501
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,410
这边
Yeah, flash it this way.

502
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,040
这里  这边来
Down here, down here!

503
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,520
好吧  B计划
Okay, plan B.

504
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,890
用灯照着
Keep the light up.

505
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,170
你在南边有隐退的地方
So you got a place down south, huh?

506
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,250
水边的好地方吗
Nice? On the water?

507
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,470
是的
Yes.

508
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,830
能给退役警察找份活儿干吗
Any work for beat-up old cops?

509
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,130
当然
Sure.

510
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,980
怎么样  吉姆
How's that sound, Jim?

511
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,010
海滩  阳光  钓钓鱼
Beaches, sunshine, fishing...

512
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,290
真不错
Yeah, tempting.

513
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,660
又见了
Hello again.

514
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,440
猫咬着舌头了  怎么不说话
Cat got your tongue?

515
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,610
太好了
Yes!

516
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,950
塞琳娜
Selena.

517
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,810
各位
Boys.

518
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,150
你们太棒了
Bless you.

519
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,600
你真厉害  菲什
Got to hand it to you, Fish.

520
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,750
太会打断表演了
You really know how to stop a show.

521
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,050
我忍不住  哈维  他惹我生气了
I couldn't help myself, Harvey, the man vexed me.

522
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,540
疯狂之举
Crazy move.

523
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,210
可能也是步好棋  走着瞧吧
Possibly a good move, too. We'll see.

524
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,260
战场形势不断变换
The battlefield is in flux.

525
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,240
说不定我会成为哥谭的新女王
You could be looking at the new Queen of Gotham.

526
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,090
恭喜你了  亲爱的
Congratulations, my dear.

527
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,250
我不干了  菲什
I'm quitting, Fish.

528
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,320
我退出
I'm out.

529
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,580
那么我是不用杀你了吗
Does this mean I don't have to kill you?

530
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,190
你要去个温暖的地方隐退  休息
You're gonna retire someplace warm, lay back,

531
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,060
读东西解闷吗
read your little funny papers?

532
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,940
-是这么想的  -嗯
- That was the thought. - Yeah.

533
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,540
想得美
Nice thought.

534
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,350
菲什
Fish!

535
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,470
不要  求你
Please, no.

536
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,330
菲什
Fish!

537
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,320
你在哪
Where are you?!

538
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:03,610
快走
Go!

539
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,130
然后他离开了
Then he left me.

540
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,000
挺长一段时间
For a long time.

541
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,000
让我一人待着
Alone.

542
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,840
我睡着了
And I slept.

543
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,030
不知道睡了多久
I don't know for how long.

544
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,370
然后他叫醒了我
And then he woke me up.

545
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,630
说要带我出去
Road trip, he said.

546
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,320
我们走了一半
We were halfway there when...

547
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,050
我才意识到
...I realized...

548
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,770
我们是要去我父母那里
...we were going to my parents' house.

549
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,510
继续说
Go on.

550
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,840
他把他们绑在了椅子上
Well, then he tied them up to a chair...

551
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,060
然后
...and, uh...

552
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,930
他让我跟他们说话
he told me to talk to them...

553
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,490
关于我童年的问题
about my childhood issues.

554
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,880
我就说了
So I did.

555
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,290
我
I...

556
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,070
想到什么就跟他们说什么
just... told them whatever came into my head.

557
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,450
你想到了什么
And what came into your head?

558
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,690
就是...
You know...

559
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,150
孩子的那些破事
just stupid kid stuff, I guess, like, uh...

560
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,180
我小时候  我妈妈会说我是她的小猪
my mom used to call me her little piggy when I was little.

561
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,720
他们丢掉我的海报
They threw away my posters.

562
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,450
从不培养我的自尊
Never nurtured my self-esteem.

563
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,670
一点点
Just slowly...

564
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,870
不停地
steadily...

565
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,770
侵蚀掉了我的灵魂
grinding away at my soul.

566
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,240
想让我
Trying to make me...

567
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,450
消失
disappear.

568
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,880
这并不是小孩子的问题
That's not kid stuff.

569
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,700
不过说句公道话
To be fair to them...

570
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,610
他们就是从来没理解过我
they simply never understood me.

571
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,600
他们完全不知道
They have no clue

572
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,980
我是什么样的人
who I am.

573
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,480
即使是我杀他们的时候
Even when I was killing them,

574
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,920
他们也只是呆呆地
they just gaped at me...

575
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,420
瞪着我
like fools.

576
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,670
根本不理解
No understanding.

577
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,680
芭芭拉
Barbara...

578
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,230
是杰森・列侬杀了你父母
Jason Lennon killed your parents.

579
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,360
不是你杀了他们
You didn't kill them.

580
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,930
是我啊
Yes, I did.

581
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,870
我捅了他们
I stabbed them...

582
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,120
好几刀
several times...

583
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,840
然后我割了他们的喉咙
and then I slit their throats.

584
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,290
我想走了
I'd like to leave now, please.

585
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,620
你不舒服吗
You uncomfortable?

586
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,540
现在呢
How about now?

587
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,930
小莱
Lee.

588
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,210
她突然就发疯了
She... She just... She just went crazy.

589
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,560
我早说那女人是个麻烦精
Told him that woman was trouble.

590
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,080
布奇
Butch.

591
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,710
可来了
About time.

592
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,070
打死她  布奇
Shoot her, Butch.

593
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,010

你干什么呢  打死他
What are you doing? Drop him.

597
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,030
我的朋友  回忆你的训练
My friend, remember your training.

598
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,740
我命令你打死她
I order you to shoot her!

599
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,260
布奇
Butch!

600
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,150
别听他的  他搅和了你的脑袋
Don't listen to him. He did something to your mind.

601
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,500
我是你的女人
I'm your girl.

602
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,940
记得吗  我是你的女人
Remember, I'm your girl.

00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,340
快杀了她
Kill her now!

604

布奇
Butch...

605
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,220
天呐  我做了什么

606
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,940

00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,650
真对不起  我绝不会伤害你的

不怪你  我也爱你

610
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,090
是他搅乱了你的头脑
He messed with your mind.

611
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,400
不怪你
It's not your fault.

00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,080
尼格玛先生

00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,110
柯林格小姐
Miss Kringle.

622
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,150
我注意到一件很怪的事
I just noticed something really weird.

623
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,110
多尔蒂警官留给我的字条

625
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,720
看
You see?

真是奇怪
How, that... How-How odd.

631
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,350
真是太巧了
What-What a... What an amazing coincidence.

632
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,560
巧合吗
Coincidence?

633
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,650
否则还能是什么
What else could it be?

634
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,350
那么你完全不知情吗
So you know nothing about this?

635
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,660
我吗  当然不
I... Me? No.

636
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,510
不知道
No.

637
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,150
不知道
No.

638
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,780
你是喜欢谜语的那个
You're the guy that likes riddles.

639
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,620
你笑什么  你个傻瓜  这不好玩
Why are you laughing, you fool? It's not funny.

640
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,700
真是个怪胎
What a creep.

641
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,600
她不会罢手的
She'll keep digging.

642
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,090
你为什么非要留下线索  为什么
Why did you have to leave a clue? Why?

643
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,220
放松
Relax.

644
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,100
她能找到什么  她能证明什么
What can she find? What can she prove?

645
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,040
什么都不能  没有尸体  不用担心什么
Nothing. There's no body. Stop worrying.

646
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,820
但她的神情好哀伤  好愤怒
But she looks so sad and angry.

647
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,150
我真不喜欢她那样看我
I hate it when she looks at me that way.

648
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,180
恐怖  古怪
Menacing and weird.

649
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180
得了  这又如何
Please. Like it matters,

650
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,990
你和她根本毫无机会
like you stand a chance with her.

651
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,080
她知道你对她的感情
She knows how you feel about her

652
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,150
却还是视你如粪土  视你如粪土
and she treats you like dirt. Treats you like dirt.

653
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,930
我不管  我还是爱她
I don't care, I still love her.

654
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,120
听听你说些什么
Oh, listen to yourself.

655
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,110
有个男人样吧
Be a man!

656
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,790
你是个怪人  尼格玛先生
You're an odd man, Mr. Nygma.

657
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,210
如果她怕你  你或许更可能成功呢
You'll do better with that one if she's a little scared of you.

658
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,070
-别说那种话  -别打谜语
- Stop talking like that. - No riddles.

659
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,980
-正式投诉数次  -正经点
- Formal complaints about you. - Just keeping it real.

660
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,430
黑的白的  一身红的  是什么  够了
What's black and white and red all over? Stop it!

661
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,700
我劝你还是别辞了工作去干这个吧
I wouldn't quit your day job if I were you.

662
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,330
他好怪啊  好...怪...
He is... so weird. So... so...

663
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,620
景色很美吧
Beautiful, huh?

664
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,830
我会怀念这里的
I'm gonna miss this town.

665
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,730
你不肯改主意吗
You won't change your mind?

666
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,820
哥谭需要你
The town needs you.

667
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,880
不
No.

668
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,570
哥谭现在需要执法者
Gotham needs a lawman now.

669
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,190
不是我这样的罪犯
Not a criminal like me.

670
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,840
一个坚强的执法者
A strong lawman.

671
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,330
你说我吗
You looking at me?

672
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:48,560
得有人狠狠整顿这座城市
Someone needs to grab this city by the neck and shake it hard.

673
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,470
得你来  吉姆
That's you, Jim.

674
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,400
我深信不疑
I know it in my bones.

675
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,790
很多有权有势之人
There's a lot of powerful men

676
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,350
不会同意的
who would disagree with you on that.

677
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,750
这刀不错吧
Nice knife, huh?

678
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,420
是你父亲的
That was your father's.

679
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,720
他很久以前给我的
He gave it to me a long time ago.

680
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,300
是一时兴起送我的生日礼物
A spur-of-the-moment birthday gift.

681
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,760
我拒绝了
I said no.

682
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,720
这刀很漂亮
Such a beautiful knife,

683
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,210
但我有持枪的人保护我
and I have men with guns to protect me.

684
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,710
他还是让我收下
He said take it.

685
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,560
人没有朋友时  刀还会忠于你
A knife is a good friend when you have no other.

686
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,810
你们那么亲密吗
You were that close.

687
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,000
曾经吧
At one time.

688
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,000
这故事的意义在于  吉姆
The point of the story, Jim--

689
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,750
你父亲是我见过最正直的人
your father was the most honest man I ever met.

690
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,390
但他还是随身携刀
But he carried a knife.

691
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,580
别再找了  布鲁斯少爷
Enough searching, Master B.

692
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,900
这里根本什么都没有
There's nothing here.

693
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,420
你父亲是个好人
Now, your father was a good man,

694
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:14,620
虽然跟所有人一样  他也有缺点
a flawed man, like anyone else.

695
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,010
但他未必就有秘密生活
Doesn't mean he had a secret life.

696
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,240
我的直觉一向是准确的
My intuition's nearly always correct.

697
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,230
嗯
Yeah, well.

698
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,700
我觉得这是常见的错觉
It's a common delusion, I find.

699
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,370
阿卡姆关了一堆"直觉很准"的人
Arkham's full of men whose intuitions are always correct.

700
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,010
视而不见是最盲目的
There are none so blind.

701
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,480
视而不见
None so blind.

702
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,800
马尔库斯・奥列里乌斯  马尔库斯・奥列里乌斯
Marcus Aurelius. Marcus Aurelius!

703
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,100
他怎么了
What about him?

704
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,200
他是个罗马皇帝
He was a Roman emperor.

705
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,410
这我知道  布鲁斯少爷
Yes, well, I'm fully aware of that, Master Bruce.

706
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:51,880
而且是斯多葛学派的  我记得是
And a stoic. I think I remember he was a stoic,

707
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,870
我父亲也是
like my father.

708
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,710
卢修斯・福克斯说我父亲清心寡欲[斯多葛学派]
Lucius Fox called my father a stoic.

709
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,120
很多人都被人这么说过
Lots of people are called stoic.

710
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,860
就是怪的意思  没什么其他意义
Basically means a hardnut. Doesn't say much.

711
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,800
这不是什么线索啊
Doesn't mean it's a bloody clue, does it?

712
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,960
那是一派哲学  阿尔弗雷德  生活方式
It's a philosophy, Alfred. It's a way of life.

713
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,960
或许也是吧  但是...
Maybe... Maybe that as well, I suppose, but...

714
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,060
你觉得这是什么
What is it, do you think?

715
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,960
我不知道  也不管
I don't know and I don't care,

716
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,620
你可不许按那个按钮
and don't you dare press that bloody button.

717
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,070
-为什么  -可能是炸弹呢
- Why not? - It could be a bomb.

718
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,110
阿尔弗雷德  这不太可能吧
Alfred, that seems improbable.

719
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,560
是音响
It's a stereo.

720
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:17,500
