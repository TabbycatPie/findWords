1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,440
Dad!
Is he all right?

2
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:06,662
He was above the fire floor.

3
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:08,573
Swallowed a lot of smoke.

4
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:11,153
We... we gotta take Dad
off the vent.

5
00:00:11,194 --> 00:00:12,316
Let him go.

6
00:00:13,819 --> 00:00:14,888
She's alive!

7
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:20,672
Sir, I'm gonna need you to go
back into the waiting room.

8
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:23,543
What happened to our Jane Doe?

9
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:27,088
We were treating Jane Doe
for third degree burns

10
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:29,098
when she developed
compartment syndrome.

11
00:00:29,139 --> 00:00:32,142
It became clear Jane had
been beaten before the fire.

12
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:33,794
Nurse went to do rounds,

13
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:35,296
saw her room like this.

14
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:40,243
How long has she been gone?

15
00:00:40,284 --> 00:00:42,460
Not long.
We checked security tapes.

16
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:44,702
She walked out alone
at half past.

17
00:00:45,788 --> 00:00:46,911
What is that?

18
00:00:46,952 --> 00:00:50,406
That is a GPS chip.

19
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:52,478
She must have cut
it out of herself.

20
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:54,747
Someone was tracking this girl.

21
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,903
She's got
life-threatening injuries.

22
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:58,880
She's not gonna
get far by herself.

23
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:06,895
Hey.

24
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,597
Jay, I, uh...

25
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,420
Just heard about your father.
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:14,459
Thanks.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,420
Jay, take some time.
Be with your family.

28
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:18,396
It's not what you think, Sarge.

29
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:20,950
Me and my dad had
a complicated relationship.

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,126
We didn't really see eye to eye.

31
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,335
I'm not proud of it.
It's the truth.

32
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:26,698
Five other people
died in that fire.

33
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:27,696
I want to help.

34
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:28,740
Mmm.

35
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:32,396
Okay.

36
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:34,790
Platt's briefing everyone
in the parking lot.

37
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,226
All right.

38
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:41,405
Jane Doe,
approximately 20 years old.

39
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:46,149
5'4", fled Chicago Med
less than 60 minutes ago.

40
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:48,325
She exited the west rear door

41
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,105
and was last seen
headed north on foot.

42
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:53,548
She is believed to be
all alone and hurt,

43
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,245
so we have to move fast.

44
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,769
Populorum, you and Henry
are on public transport...

45
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,510
- Hey, you wanna take north?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:03,005
- Just, Jay, I'm sorry...
- Thanks.

47
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:04,682
So, uh, just fill me in.

48
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:06,474
Okay, she dug out
her own GPS chip,

49
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,128
so obviously
she doesn't wanna be found.

50
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:10,260
She has third degree burns,
multiple broken bones.

51
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,613
She couldn't have
got out of there too fast.

52
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:12,915
So where would you go?

53
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,439
I don't know.
Find someplace to hide.

54
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:17,310
Someplace to die.

55
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:19,795
You go that way,
I'll go this way?

56
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,837
Yeah, I'll go over here.

57
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:29,497
Jay?

58
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,802
Jay!

59
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,761
5021 Eddie, emergency.

60
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,288
We need an ambulance
at the southwest corner

61
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,633
of Bryers Park.

62
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:37,630
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, stay with us.

63
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:38,958
Hey.
Hey, hey.

64
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,090
I don't know what's wrong.
She's bleeding really bad.

65
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,338
We need that ambulance.

66
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:47,341
They're never gonna find us.
I'm gonna flag them down, Jay.

67
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:48,693
I repeat, we're in
the southwest corner...

68
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,257
It's okay.
It's okay.

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,827
Can you look at me?
Hey, can you look at me?

70
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,434
It's gonna be okay.
I'm Jay.

71
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:55,193
I'm a detective with the
Chicago Police Department.

72
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,177
You're gonna be okay.
What's your name?

73
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,222
He came to kill them.

74
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,745
Who came?

75
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,233
I was hiding, but he set a fire.

76
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,751
Who did this to you?
Who set the fire?

77
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,014
- You know who he was?
- He killed them.

78
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:11,192
Who?
What's his name?

79
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,322
Who was he?
Who was he?

80
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,845
Did you know him?

81
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:16,460
Ah... I'll be free now.

82
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,332
Yeah, you'll be free.
You'll be free now.

83
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,508
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

84
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:25,857
Come on, come on!

85
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:49,359
She said she was hiding
and he came to kill them.

86
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,712
Then before she
lost consciousness,

87
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:53,320
she said that
she would be free now.

88
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:54,585
I'm running her prints
and her DNA,

89
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,236
but no ID yet.

90
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,846
All right, Chief?

91
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,240
Fire originated
in apartment 20E.

92
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:03,591
We found Jane Doe's body here
outside of the apartment.

93
00:04:04,123 --> 00:04:06,942
Burns indicated she was
most likely crawling,

94
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,118
trying to escape the flames.

95
00:04:09,326 --> 00:04:11,947
Door to 20E was open.
That's how the fire spread.

96
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,558
The other John Does were found
inside the apartment...

97
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,299
one in the bed,
one near the front door.

98
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,345
All right, so she said that
he came to kill them.

99
00:04:18,388 --> 00:04:20,260
So the offender
enters the apartment,

100
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,871
he kills both John Does,
the Jane Doe's hiding,

101
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,612
the offender goes
to light the fire,

102
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:27,571
she tries to escape, and then
she gets beaten unconscious.

103
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,312
Injuries run against that,
Sharon?

104
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,748
It could be consistent.

105
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:33,664
Jane Doe suffered
a ulna fracture,

106
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,927
internal injuries,
third degree burns.

107
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:38,669
We also treated her for
heavy smoke inhalation.

108
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,889
So the offender beats her,
thinks she's dead,

109
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,543
but Jane Doe comes to
during the fire,

110
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:43,895
opens the front door,
and attempts to crawl

111
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:45,546
to the elevator.

112
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,331
Arson was just a cover up
for the double homicide.

113
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,464
The rest of them were
collateral damage.

114
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,871
Jane Doe didn't make it.
Pronounced her a minute ago.

115
00:04:57,912 --> 00:05:00,240
She never
regained consciousness.

116
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,324
All right, we need to get going.

117
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:03,613
Thank you.

118
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,864
- Anything you need.
- Appreciate it.

119
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,439
Let's start with apartment 20E.

120
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,177
Antonio, get Jane Doe's GPS
chip to OCD tech right away.

121
00:05:13,218 --> 00:05:14,785
I'll run it up with Vice, too.

122
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:16,372
It's common practice
these days for pimps

123
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:17,731
- to chip their property.
- All right.

124
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,363
I'm guessing Jane Doe was
a victim of sex trafficking.

125
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,626
So we start with
what was left behind.

126
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,802
I want every piece of paper
on that apartment...

127
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,935
who was living there,
every in-service call.

128
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:30,460
Just scour that crime scene.
Work the bodies.

129
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,636
Find out what the hell happened
in that apartment.

130
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,902
We've been working
round the clock.

131
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:40,862
I've only done a full autopsy
on your first John Doe.

132
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:42,732
What about dental?
Did you get anything from that?

133
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:43,825
Didn't match any of our records.

134
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,519
And honestly you're
not gonna get much.

135
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:47,390
Bodies burned this badly
rarely have a ton

136
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:48,783
of forensic evidence.

137
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,053
Tox was clear on John Doe one.

138
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:54,425
W-what is this chipping
of the hyoid and spine?

139
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:56,660
It's usually cracking
from the fire,

140
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:59,750
but what's strange
is both bodies had it.

141
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,824
Cracking of the hyoid?

142
00:06:01,865 --> 00:06:03,014
On one, it's an anomaly.

143
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:05,408
- On two...
- It's a pattern.

144
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,446
Same kind of cracking
you'd get from a weapon?

145
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:09,444
- From a knife.
- So they were stabbed?

146
00:06:09,485 --> 00:06:11,922
Yes, and throat sliced.

147
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,031
- Sarge?
- Yeah, I'm still listening.

148
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:18,378
All right, M.E. also found
three old bullet holes

149
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,118
and a severed finger
on John Doe two.

150
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,645
We ran that through
every system we've got.

151
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:22,991
So far no hit on an ID,

152
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,518
but those are pretty
unique identifiers.

153
00:06:24,558 --> 00:06:26,885
So, flag it up
the ladder with FBI.

154
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:29,363
See if they'll run it.
Hit hospital records too.

155
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,888
I've got spotty elevator
and lobby cameras,

156
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,556
but the camera
nearest the entrance

157
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,207
got fritzed out in the fire.

158
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:37,400
The building across the street
got surveillance from the front.

159
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,355
I got POD footage from
the exit in the back,

160
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:40,400
but it's not perfect.

161
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:41,970
When Chicago Fire responded,
they blocked the camera.

162
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,186
All right, well,
start clearing through it fast.

163
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:46,449
Hey, we got anything
on that apartment?

164
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,972
Nothing but sand, Sarge.

165
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,535
It was registered under a dummy
LLC called Cyde Holdings

166
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,443
that does not exist.

167
00:06:51,484 --> 00:06:53,983
There's no in service calls,
no priors on anyone so far

168
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:55,765
in the apartment.
Burgess is still there.

169
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,616
She's debriefing
the current residents.

170
00:06:57,657 --> 00:06:59,062
So far everybody's
saying they thought

171
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,158
the apartment was vacant.

172
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,073
Hey, Sarge, OCD tech lab pulled

173
00:07:02,117 --> 00:07:04,075
coordinates off
Jane Doe's GPS chip.

174
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,257
I've got every place she's been
the last two months

175
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:07,905
outside Chicago...
all two of them.

176
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,081
Tracked a farmland outside
Durango, Mexico,

177
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,649
and a compound two miles
from Cleveland.

178
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:15,059
I ran those coordinates
for John Doe's bullet wounds,

179
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,566
for the finger injury.

180
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,438
Got a hit.

181
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:29,579
Edgar Torres.

182
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:34,105
You're saying Edgar Torres
of the Sinaloa Cartel

183
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,160
just got hit in Chicago?

184
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,889
Hey, Hank.

185
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:40,459
You got a problem downstairs.

186
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:44,560
- Come on, Antonio. You and me.
- Yeah.

187
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:47,647
Hey, find out what Torres
was doing in Chicago, Jay.

188
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,171
Wondering why the hell
you ran DEA's number five

189
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:58,739
most wanted and requested sixes

190
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,741
without picking up the phone
and calling us.

191
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,736
Well, I'm wondering
why the hell you weren't aware

192
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:04,484
your number five target
was in Chicago

193
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,050
and that he was just murdered.

194
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:08,575
We been trying to track him,
but it's not easy.

195
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,707
When Torres comes to Chicago
he stays low...

196
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,344
holds a few meetings,
oversees a few loads,

197
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:14,996
and we don't hear about it
until after.

198
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,473
And he doesn't communicate.

199
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:19,238
No cell, no email.
He stays inside. He eats in.

200
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,544
It's just him, his security,
and his girl of the month.

201
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,111
Those are the
other bodies you found.

202
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:26,310
Okay, well, someone knew
he was here this time.

203
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,769
We're not here to hinder
your investigation, Voight.

204
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:30,543
Okay, so why are you here?

205
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:32,773
We'll be taking
Edgar Torres' body.

206
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:34,536
You want to confirm his death,

207
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:37,193
cross a name off a list?
Be my guest.

208
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,170
And we want you
to low-walk the case.

209
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,650
There it is.

210
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,086
We have wires up

211
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,262
on every cartel
with holdings in Chicago.

212
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:46,257
Not a single wire indicates
that anyone knows

213
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:48,832
Torres is even dead,
let alone that it was a hit.

214
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,878
It would be best
it stays that way.

215
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,576
Soon as they become aware,
every phone will go dark.

216
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,649
- And bodies will drop.
- With all due respect,

217
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,840
this was a mass murder,

218
00:08:56,884 --> 00:08:58,659
so we're not gonna stop till
we find the son of a bitch

219
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:00,919
that lit the match,
cartel repercussions or not.

220
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,545
We can tell the press
the fire was accidental

221
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:08,681
and we can move quiet,
but you gotta give me

222
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:11,028
every piece of paper
you have on Torres.

223
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,769
No blacked out lines.

224
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:14,858
No red tape.

225
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,905
You do that,
I'll tiptoe anywhere you want.

226
00:09:20,114 --> 00:09:22,005
This is the last batch.
I mean, there's hundreds

227
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,721
of people who wanted
Edgar Torres dead.

228
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,066
Hundreds who'd want him dead,

229
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,239
but only a few
who would have access.

230
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,518
And the guy was old school...
no phones,

231
00:09:27,558 --> 00:09:28,863
did business face to face.

232
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:30,051
That's why the DEA
never got close to him.

233
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:32,140
15 years they had Torres ID'd.
They could never find a way

234
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,921
to infiltrate.
Guy was a ghost.

235
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:35,792
Think someone was involved
on the inside.

236
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,519
So let's start
in his inner circle.

237
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,040
People who were loyal.

238
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:41,412
Yeah, people who
would never roll.

239
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,715
Carlos Mendoza, 56 years old.

240
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,761
Been in Chicago for the past 30.

241
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,676
DEA caught him up
seven years ago,

242
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,112
thought he was Torres' driver.

243
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,940
Held him for 48, grilled him,

244
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,699
and they got absolutely nothing.

245
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,247
Carlos never said a word.

246
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,032
All right,
so where's Carlos now?

247
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:00,643
Lives right here in Chicago.
Lives alone in Fuller Park.

248
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,166
Also has two adult sons.

249
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,041
But we still believe
he's involved with the cartel.

250
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,170
Gets paid every week
from a trumped-up LLC.

251
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:07,565
Ran Carlos' cell.

252
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,916
Pinged a tower outside
Colima, Mexico a few days ago.

253
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,742
Matches Jane Doe's
GPS coordinates to a T.

254
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,049
Right, so,
picked up Torres' girlfriend

255
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,659
and the bodyguard down in Mexico

256
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,965
and drove them all back here.

257
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,923
- Just to sell his ass out.
- Mm-hmm.

258
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,099
We got Carlos on footage.

259
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:24,215
Traffic cam caught him
in a silver SUV

260
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,364
parked outside the apartment
for eight hours.

261
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,824
Was he there during the fire?

262
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:30,350
Whole time.

263
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,598
Let's move.

264
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,379
All right,
we move careful and silent.

265
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:42,903
Ruzek, you're with me.

266
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:44,948
Burgess, Upton,
you take downstairs.

267
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:47,124
Halstead, secure the back.
Do not enter.

268
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:49,982
Okay?
Let's go.

269
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,224
Freeze!

270
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:47,750
What the hell are you doing?
Damn it, Jay.

271
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:50,576
- Why did you come inside?
- 'Cause I saw movement.

272
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:52,215
Jay, I almost shot you.

273
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:53,313
Yeah, but you didn't, all right?

274
00:11:53,353 --> 00:11:54,059
You broke the plan.

275
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,844
I almost put a bullet
in your head.

276
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,197
Carlos was going
for the back door

277
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:57,721
so I had to make a move,
all right? Let's go.

278
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,316
Target apprehended.
We're coming out.

279
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:00,720
<i>Copy that.</i>

280
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,199
Come on.

281
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:12,037
Edgar Torres...
cartel head, drug trafficker,

282
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:13,598
and the DEA's number five
most wanted.

283
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,162
That's him three weeks ago.

284
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:17,094
Oh, wait, I got a picture too.

285
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:22,399
That's him today.

286
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,168
Now, Edgar Torres
is also your boss.

287
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,871
You're one of very few
who knew he was here.

288
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,660
And that's you

289
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:30,619
outside the building

290
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,665
while Torres is
being stabbed to death.

291
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,321
And I'm just doing the
math here, Carlos, but...

292
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,497
I wouldn't want to be you.

293
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:44,918
You know I'm not
gonna talk to you.

294
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,035
Yes, you will,

295
00:12:46,076 --> 00:12:47,849
because right now, me and him...
we're your best shot

296
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:49,164
at seeing the light again.
So the quicker

297
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:51,590
you start talking to us,
the more honest you get,

298
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:52,517
the better this goes.

299
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:53,527
And if you had the evidence

300
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:55,566
to make that true,
you'd be charging me.

301
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,555
When you're charged that's
the least of your problems.

302
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:58,595
Bro.

303
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,825
Cartel's got to be asking
the same questions we are.

304
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,522
And if that were true,

305
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:06,698
I'd already be dead.

306
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:09,832
I don't talk to you.

307
00:13:10,146 --> 00:13:11,654
All right,
you be cute all you want.

308
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:13,200
That's up to you.

309
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:17,334
But this isn't just
bad guy on bad guy.

310
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:21,193
Five other innocent people
were killed in that fire.

311
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:24,194
Know what that means?

312
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:27,045
That means you're never
leaving this room

313
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,243
unless you talk.

314
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:30,853
Then you and I
are at a standstill.

315
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,768
And one of those
innocent people?

316
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,727
He was a cop's father.
You understand it yet, Carlos?

317
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,251
You know,
it wouldn't be a bad thing

318
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:38,810
to sit this one out.

319
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,604
- Need me to talk to you?
- I don't need anything, Jay.

320
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:45,346
All right, look,
my father and I...

321
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:46,869
we never clicked.

322
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:49,684
He didn't want me to enlist.
He didn't want me to be a cop.

323
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:52,519
Guy didn't even show up when I
graduated from the academy.

324
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,076
He was embarrassed.

325
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,389
So I learned
to keep my distance,

326
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,895
and now he's gone.
That's it.

327
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:00,506
I'm learning how to deal
with it on my own.

328
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,551
You don't have to question
if I'm all right.

329
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,246
Carlos isn't talking yet.
We need leverage.

330
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,582
I've looked through
every hour of footage.

331
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,902
There's no evidence that Carlos
ever enters the building.

332
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,379
We got Torres,
Jane Doe, his security.

333
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,105
They all come in
five hours before the fire

334
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:25,497
but after that
it's only residents.

335
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:26,474
And I've gone through it twice.

336
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,914
Yeah, we've cleared
everyone in that building.

337
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,694
None of them look like
they're involved.

338
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:32,129
All right,
so we go back to basics.

339
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,115
Antonio, keep working Carlos
while we backtrack.

340
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:37,342
Look, no one just wakes up
in the morning and decides

341
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:38,992
to make a play on a cartel boss.

342
00:14:39,526 --> 00:14:40,905
There was planning.

343
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,610
Someone got in that building,
did those murders,

344
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:45,506
set that fire.

345
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,174
Find out how.
That'll get us to who.

346
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:54,894
First body was found in here,
inside the door.

347
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,668
Well, if he came in
through the hallway,

348
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:58,267
security let him in.

349
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,234
Security knew him.

350
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,102
I mean, that fits
with Carlos, right?

351
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:04,456
Second body was
found in bed there.

352
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:08,298
Arson said the body was prone.
Guy never got up.

353
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,821
All right, so offender comes in,

354
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,475
takes security out
of the equation,

355
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,477
moves in here.
Torres is asleep.

356
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,957
He takes him out nice and easy.

357
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,960
Starts the fire here unaware
that Jane Doe is hiding.

358
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:21,398
- There's no other exits?
- Only the front door.

359
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,965
These windows are
a 20-story drop.

360
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,083
Or he came from next door.

361
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:00,354
The roof next door had
a hidden security camera.

362
00:16:00,394 --> 00:16:03,399
Facial recognition ID'd Daniel
Mendoza in under a minute.

363
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,528
Carlos' oldest son.

364
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:07,488
He's caught on this roof
four times in the past week

365
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:10,360
including an hour before
the fire went off.

366
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:12,626
All he would have had to do
is hop over to the window

367
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:14,525
once the fire was going.
Cameras are being destroyed.

368
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:15,430
People were evacuating.

369
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:17,023
He could have walked
out the front door.

370
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,543
Daniel Mendoza is the black
sheep out of the two brothers...

371
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:20,980
in and out of behavior programs.

372
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,157
Got kicked out of Harper
College after a semester

373
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:24,321
for anger issues.

374
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:25,946
Daniel's working
for a trucking company

375
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:27,813
that's hauling produce
from Mexico to Chicago.

376
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,063
They changed their IDOT
four times in the last year.

377
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:32,020
The company's owned by
the same trumped-up LLC

378
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:33,454
who's paying off Carlos.

379
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:35,643
He's cartel.
Like father, like son.

380
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:38,016
It's the same boss too.
Torres.

381
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:39,737
- Yeah.
- Huh.

382
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,609
You know,
it could be a power play.

383
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,872
Cartels are organizations,
so if Daniel and Carlos

384
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:46,657
are working beneath Torres,
Torres holds their fate.

385
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:48,460
If he isn't willing to promote...

386
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:51,068
You get rid of him,
find a new boss who is.

387
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:54,169
Get an expedited warrant.

388
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,639
You had your son killed for you.

389
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:03,413
And you told him,
"Torres is inside."

390
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:06,503
He sneaks in, takes care
of the messy details.

391
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:08,679
You both profit,

392
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,308
except something went wrong.

393
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:15,077
Kid didn't expect Jane Doe
to survive, right?

394
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:17,150
It's not possible.

395
00:17:17,191 --> 00:17:20,504
There's seven bodies on
you and your boy right now.

396
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,258
I mean, you wanna take
any of that weight off,

397
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:25,083
now's the time to talk.

398
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:30,510
No.

399
00:17:32,028 --> 00:17:33,682
I got nothing to say.

400
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,267
Warrant's ready to go.

401
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:44,009
Chicago PD!

402
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:10,698
Whoa, everybody stop.
Do not key your radios.

403
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:28,026
The cameras are motion censored?

404
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,604
Yeah, motion censored
and hooked up

405
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:30,893
to Daniel Mendoza's cloud.

406
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,685
As soon as we moved in,
cameras recorded

407
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,885
- and sent images digitally.
- That's smart.

408
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:37,111
I mean, this apartment's gotta
be his contingency plan.

409
00:18:37,152 --> 00:18:38,842
He set it up as a fail-safe.

410
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:40,972
If his plan failed and
the cartel came for him,

411
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:42,402
the apartment would alert him.

412
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,557
Hey, here he is.
What's up?

413
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:46,839
Hank, it doesn't look like
there's any sign of explosives.

414
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:47,956
The place is clear of chemicals.

415
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:49,392
Just looks like the apartment
was rigged with the cameras.

416
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,979
We're almost finished clearing.

417
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,190
So we're waiting for nothing.
He's probably in the damn wind.

418
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,251
We basically just
told him to run.

419
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,137
All right,
so we get ahead of him.

420
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,398
Get out a BOLO,
investigative alert,

421
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,576
- emergency ping.
- All right.

422
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:00,696
- Thanks, Sully.
- You got it.

423
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:02,260
Kelly, appreciate it.

424
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,401
Jay.

425
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:07,173
Yo, I've been meaning
to tell you, I'm...

426
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,408
Don't, don't.

427
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,723
Kelly, honestly, man, you're...
you're, like, the only guy

428
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,907
that hasn't given me some
half-ass sympathy speech.

429
00:19:12,948 --> 00:19:13,555
So you don't have to, all right?

430
00:19:13,596 --> 00:19:14,581
- No.
- It's all good.

431
00:19:14,622 --> 00:19:15,853
I wasn't going to.

432
00:19:17,606 --> 00:19:20,174
I was gonna say I wanna
be here when you find him.

433
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,086
We pulled bodies
out of that fire.

434
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:24,813
I watched Stella
almost lose her life...

435
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:26,596
for a cartel hit?

436
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:30,932
Anything I can do to help...
anything... I'll help.

437
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:33,544
All right.
Thanks, man.

438
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,938
All right,
transport teams are up...

439
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:43,696
airports, trains,
buses, and highways.

440
00:19:43,737 --> 00:19:44,528
- Thank you.
- Yep.

441
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:45,869
We got BOLOs out on his vehicle,

442
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,360
checking the
traffic cams and PODS.

443
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,013
We tapping into the El.

444
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,070
CTA has all his descriptors,
and Antonio's hitting

445
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:52,276
his contacts now.

446
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:53,689
- Cell?
- Dark.

447
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,079
Daniel turned it off.
No movement.

448
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,455
Yeah, he's gonna
know better than that.

449
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,591
He'll have an exit strategy.

450
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,282
An exit strategy he
wasn't expecting to use.

451
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,418
I mean, I don't know if
it'll be easy to execute.

452
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:04,530
He hasn't had more than
a grand in his bank account.

453
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,034
He's gonna need help
getting out of Chicago.

454
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:07,595
Or he just steals a car
and he heads for the border.

455
00:20:07,635 --> 00:20:08,635
Hmm.

456
00:20:09,753 --> 00:20:11,487
We need another access point.

457
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,182
Carlos is our only option.

458
00:20:14,557 --> 00:20:17,062
Daniel followed his father's
footsteps into the cartel.

459
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,641
Whether or not Carlos
ordered him

460
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,205
to kill Torres doesn't matter.

461
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:22,727
He got where he is because
his father led him there.

462
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:25,078
Phone records indicate him
and his father talk a lot,

463
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,268
at least twice a day.

464
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,948
Yeah, so he's gonna know
where his son is,

465
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:29,569
or how to get in touch with him.

466
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,437
We gotta force him to talk.

467
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,495
All right.
You and me.

468
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,377
Hey, rise and shine.

469
00:20:48,662 --> 00:20:49,941
Come on, wake up.

470
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,593
Let's go.

471
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,558
- I'd like a lawyer.
- Huh.

472
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:01,633
Yeah.
Yeah, we could do that.

473
00:21:02,948 --> 00:21:04,559
Or we could just
tell you the truth.

474
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:07,088
We got jack on you.

475
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:09,219
I mean, we can't prove
you entered the building.

476
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,450
We got no bead on your kid.

477
00:21:10,491 --> 00:21:12,010
Okay, then release me.

478
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,846
You sure about that?

479
00:21:16,096 --> 00:21:19,245
'Cause all we gotta do is
give your name to your people

480
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,715
and we'll let you go.

481
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:27,111
You're a dead man.

482
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:29,636
You're a smart guy, Carlos.

483
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:32,385
You worked with Sinaloa
for decades,

484
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:35,955
but you know how this
is gonna end for you,

485
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,135
for your son.

486
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,033
Nice and slow.

487
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,868
Gonna tie you down
with barbed wire.

488
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:47,828
They're gonna
probably burn you first...

489
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:50,940
your feet, genitals.

490
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:52,987
Make you beg.

491
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,932
Then they'll wire you
to a generator.

492
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:57,268
They're gonna electrocute you.

493
00:21:57,309 --> 00:21:59,196
They're gonna cut your heads off

494
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:01,977
and hang you upside down from
the Franklin Street Bridge...

495
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:10,157
Unless you wanna help us.

496
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,896
Tell us what happened.

497
00:22:13,456 --> 00:22:14,877
Help us find Daniel.

498
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:17,336
Come on.

499
00:22:17,956 --> 00:22:20,600
I mean, prison ain't great,
but it's better than that.

500
00:22:21,143 --> 00:22:22,385
You know what?

501
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:25,831
I dug my grave a long time ago.

502
00:22:26,581 --> 00:22:29,872
Whatever you think of me,
I tried like hell

503
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:32,960
to give my kids a good life...

504
00:22:36,316 --> 00:22:38,262
A better life, a different life.

505
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:40,228
But Daniel, he chose this.

506
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:42,825
He... there's nothing I could do.

507
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:47,757
These men could find
him or me just as easily

508
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,348
in any jail cell.

509
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:52,544
You can't protect us.

510
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,887
You know we're dead either way.

511
00:22:56,716 --> 00:22:57,973
Hmm.

512
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:01,597
I will not help you.

513
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:08,518
I'm not gonna help you
kill my son.

514
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:18,448
Juan Mendoza.
He's 28 years old.

515
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:19,784
He's Carlos' other son.

516
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:21,097
He's got no connection
to the cartel.

517
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:22,425
He's married.
He's got three kids.

518
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:23,623
He's got a good job downtown.

519
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:26,276
We pick him up, he's our
access point to Carlos.

520
00:23:26,317 --> 00:23:28,624
We ran Juan.
We got nothing on him.

521
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:30,223
They don't know that.

522
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,282
Contrary to public opinion,
fathers have favorites.

523
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,424
If we squeeze Juan,
Carlos rolls on Daniel.

524
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:35,808
Okay, it's too risky.

525
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:37,808
We get Juan involved,
then he's actually involved.

526
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,277
The cartel starts
gunning for him too.

527
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,422
Yeah, man.
That ain't right.

528
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,159
There's gotta be
a better way to do this.

529
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,201
Like what?

530
00:23:48,296 --> 00:23:50,143
Exactly.
We're at a dead end, right?

531
00:23:50,184 --> 00:23:51,660
I don't even know why
we're debating this.

532
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,307
Because we're playing with
an innocent man's life, Jay.

533
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:55,698
Five other innocent people
died because of this guy's

534
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,599
not-so-innocent
brother and father.

535
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,475
So I'm sorry if my heart
doesn't bleed like yours.

536
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:01,440
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

537
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,864
That's enough.

538
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:05,788
It's what we have.
It's what we'll use.

539
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:06,847
Bring him in.

540
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,027
That's him.

541
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,919
Juan Mendoza.

542
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:29,642
Chicago Police.
I'm Officer Ruzek.

543
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:31,513
This is Detective Upton.

544
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,346
What's going on?

545
00:24:33,387 --> 00:24:34,389
Just wanna bring you down

546
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:35,957
to the district,
ask you a few questions.

547
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:38,346
- It's gonna be nice and easy.
- Questioning for what?

548
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,504
We'll clear all that up
at the district.

549
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,525
- I don't think so.
- Listen, man, listen, hey.

550
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,487
We just need to talk to you,
ask you a few questions.

551
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,094
That's all.

552
00:24:47,372 --> 00:24:48,372
No.

553
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:51,751
- Sir, if you could please...
- Look, I just said no.

554
00:24:51,794 --> 00:24:53,492
You have information
that can help us.

555
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,284
I assure you, I don't.

556
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,456
You know why
we're bringing you in.

557
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,152
Your family's all hooked up.
Your brother...

558
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,177
Look, what my family does
is of no concern to me...

559
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:01,956
No concern?
No concern?

560
00:25:01,997 --> 00:25:02,823
Jay, we're outside.

561
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:04,268
Mass murder's no concern to you?

562
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:05,329
Jay, not here, man.

563
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,813
Not when I know nothing
that could help you.

564
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,728
We're not asking you.
We're telling you... move.

565
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:09,903
Hey look, man,
you just need to...

566
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,553
- Move!
- Hey, hey, hey.

567
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,512
- Jay, back off!
- It's harassment.

568
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,904
- It's harassment!
- Back off!

569
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:16,819
- Keep walking.
- You good?

570
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,386
Yeah, I'm good.

571
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,294
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

572
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:35,518
Accessory?
Conspiracy to commit murder?

573
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:38,060
Your father told us
he told you that

574
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:39,494
Edgar Torres was in town.

575
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,278
No, he didn't.

576
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:44,412
We never talked about him
or drugs or any of it, ever.

577
00:25:44,637 --> 00:25:46,794
You had breakfast two weeks ago?

578
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,199
Yeah.

579
00:25:48,262 --> 00:25:50,113
He's my father.
We had breakfast.

580
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:52,028
Are ham and cheese omelets
suddenly illegal?

581
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:55,249
No, but homicide is,

582
00:25:55,629 --> 00:25:58,339
and he told you where
Edgar Torres would be and when.

583
00:25:58,382 --> 00:25:59,862
That's right,
then you called Daniel

584
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,516
and relayed the info
to him, right?

585
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,431
And helped him with the murder.

586
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:05,259
This is insane.

587
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:07,770
Look, I know
my brother's no saint,

588
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,916
but that has nothing
to do with me.

589
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,838
You're not seeming to understand

590
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:13,213
what's happening, Juan.

591
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,754
You're in the middle of
a very bad situation.

592
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:18,458
- Look, I've got three kids.
- All right?

593
00:26:18,499 --> 00:26:21,451
A job... a real job that
you dragged me away from.

594
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:23,016
You think this is gonna work?

595
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:24,661
I don't know,

596
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:28,137
but we're already down
the road, so I hope so.

597
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:36,332
Get up.

598
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,723
What?

599
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:40,574
We're letting you go.
Come on.

600
00:26:41,872 --> 00:26:44,080
- How's that possible?
- 'Cause time's up.

601
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:46,430
We don't have enough
evidence to charge you.

602
00:26:48,645 --> 00:26:49,911
So let's go.

603
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:58,011
- What's going on?
- Hey, come on.

604
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,534
- Let's go.
- Well, that's... that's my son.

605
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:01,492
- What's Juan doing in there?
- Just keep moving.

606
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,339
- What is he doing in there?
- Sir, you need to keep moving.

607
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:05,065
What is Juan doing in there?

608
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:06,464
Juan's there because
we believe he's involved.

609
00:27:06,504 --> 00:27:08,045
- Look, that's not possible!
- Yes, it is.

610
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:09,373
He's your son.
He's Daniel's brother.

611
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:10,327
It makes perfect sense
he's involved.

612
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,282
No, you can't have him
in there, all right?

613
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,424
- He didn't do anything.
- Yes, he did.

614
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:15,550
That's why
we're taking him to county.

615
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,461
He can't go to county!
No, no, no!

616
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:19,573
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I got it. I got it.

617
00:27:19,614 --> 00:27:20,972
Calm down,
or I'm gonna book you, too,

618
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:22,165
and let them kill
the whole family in county.

619
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:24,254
You can't have him in there!
They're gonna kill him!

620
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:25,534
It's already done!
He's going!

621
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:27,042
I never talked to him
about my job.

622
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,908
- Juan is straight.
- Well, what about Daniel?

623
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:32,215
I told Daniel that
I was picking up Torres.

624
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,391
Please.
Please, whatever you want.

625
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:35,697
Just let Juan go.

626
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,224
He's not involved
in any of this stuff.

627
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:38,458
Please.

628
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:42,823
So you told Daniel
Torres was in Chicago?

629
00:27:42,864 --> 00:27:44,057
Yes, but we were just talking.

630
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,881
I had no idea he was
gonna take him out.

631
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:47,381
You didn't tell him
to kill Torres?

632
00:27:47,422 --> 00:27:49,206
No, of course not.

633
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:50,538
Look, I'm a driver.

634
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:52,573
I don't sell drugs.
I don't kill people.

635
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:53,770
I drive.

636
00:27:53,811 --> 00:27:55,691
I never imagined Daniel
would do something like that,

637
00:27:55,731 --> 00:27:57,870
- but he must've seen a chance.
- For what?

638
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,012
For power.

639
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:02,565
All Daniel wanted
was weight in the cartel.

640
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:04,397
I don't give him any...
the opposite.

641
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:07,163
I'm the help... no different
than the maid or a gardener.

642
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:09,557
But with Torres gone,
Daniel would move up.

643
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,950
Now that's the truth.

644
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:12,952
Now, just let Juan go.
Please.

645
00:28:12,995 --> 00:28:15,606
The truth is,
none of that matters

646
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,478
unless you tell us
how to find Daniel.

647
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:19,045
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

648
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:20,394
It's an easy choice.

649
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,323
It's the son who did
everything wrong,

650
00:28:22,364 --> 00:28:23,332
or it's the one who listened.

651
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:25,072
Look, you are not a father!

652
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:26,597
This is not how
you love your children!

653
00:28:26,637 --> 00:28:29,359
Carlos!
We need to go now.

654
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:35,817
You give us Daniel,
or we are gonna go charge Juan.

655
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:40,684
What do you want?

656
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,071
I could get in touch
with Daniel.

657
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:58,215
Just let Juan go.
Please.

658
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,746
Please.

659
00:29:05,645 --> 00:29:08,442
So Carlos and Daniel have a
shared disposable email account

660
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:10,270
that Carlos set up
for hazards of the job.

661
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:11,812
Yeah, they only
communicate through drafts

662
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:13,102
so nothing ever
leaves the server.

663
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:14,625
We can't ping them
through email alone.

664
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,145
All right,
but Carlos reached out.

665
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,581
He told Daniel that
he wasn't safe.

666
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,108
He was gonna help him
get out of Chicago.

667
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,327
Daniel agreed to
keep his phone on.

668
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,977
4:00 p.m. today.

669
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,738
Daniel's gonna keep
his phone off until then.

670
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:24,984
All right, well,
you're with Carlos.

671
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:27,635
He makes a call,
you ping Daniel's location.

672
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,464
Rest of us, we're gonna
set up a citywide grid.

673
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:31,810
Okay?
Get everyone on board.

674
00:29:31,851 --> 00:29:33,635
We're gonna be in teams of two.

675
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:35,512
As soon as Antonio
calls with a location,

676
00:29:35,556 --> 00:29:38,418
we move in quick,
steady, silent.

677
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,684
Let's go.

678
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,609
<i>We're in position.</i>

679
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,848
<i>West side, 33rd and Normal.</i>

680
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,930
<i>All right, copy that.
Just below the north side.</i>

681
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:49,222
All right, as soon as we get
the location, teams move out.

682
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,488
You get there first, you hit it.

683
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:53,504
<i>All right, Antonio, you set?</i>

684
00:29:54,488 --> 00:29:56,737
We're good to go.
Wire's up.

685
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:01,910
All right, now,
when Daniel turns his phone on,

686
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,940
longitude and latitude

687
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,197
will come up
on the screen instantly,

688
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,460
but you need to keep
Daniel on the phone

689
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,754
as long as possible.

690
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:09,407
- If he shuts the phone off...
- I understand it.

691
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:12,919
Look...

692
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,917
You're doing the right thing

693
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,465
for both your children.

694
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:21,332
There is no right thing.

695
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:29,403
Two minutes out.
Be ready to move.

696
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:30,770
Jay.

697
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:34,113
You're not coming.

698
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:35,895
What?

699
00:30:35,936 --> 00:30:38,044
Give her your keys
and your two-way.

700
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:41,144
You gotta be kidding me.

701
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:46,061
It's for the best, Jay.
Keys and the two-way.

702
00:30:46,674 --> 00:30:47,979
You're too close to this, Jay.

703
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,979
The hell does that mean?

704
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,760
He's your dad.
I didn't say anything...

705
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:51,853
You don't know
anything about my dad.

706
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,659
- I'm not pretending to.
- No, you're just projecting

707
00:30:53,699 --> 00:30:55,465
whatever daddy-daughter crap
got you screwed up.

708
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,377
Okay, I'm done
being your punching bag.

709
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,934
Give me your keys.

710
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:02,997
Give me your damn keys!

711
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:09,990
Two-way.

712
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:16,606
You ready?

713
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:40,090
Danny?

714
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:07,490
You said if I needed help
that you would help.

715
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:08,801
I need help.

716
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:19,278
- Did you bring your radio?
- Yeah.

717
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,247
You're not gonna get
a police frequency.

718
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:22,489
That's all right.
If he's shot,

719
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:23,795
they're gonna need an ambo,
if they're in pursuit,

720
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,611
they're gonna shut down traffic.

721
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:29,210
<i>Ambo 26, adult female,</i>

00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,906

723
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,596
You're on Englewood.
Switch to Main.

724
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:35,214
Turn it all the way to the left.

725
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:38,217
<i>Ambo 62, Engine 83,

<i>CPD not responding.</i>

That's him. He's running.

737
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,864
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

738
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,243
Whoa!

739
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:20,694
What are you doing?

740
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:22,130
Lieutenant Kelly Severide, CFD.

741
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:24,219
- What's happening?
- Man with a gun, but hey...

742
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:25,868
We got eyes on the offender?

743
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:27,874
No. Last seen on foot
headed eastbound,

744
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:28,905
- but Intelligence...
- I'm Intelligence.

745
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:30,055
- Give me your radio.
- My radio?

746
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,228
- Give me your radio, man.
- Hey, hey.

747
00:33:31,268 --> 00:33:33,563
- Kelly.
- We're good, just find him.

748
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:36,231
What are you doing?

749
00:33:36,275 --> 00:33:37,798
<i>Columbus and North Water.</i>

Out of my way.
Out of my way.

758
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:18,331
Out of my way!

759
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:23,757
Police! Stop!

760
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:49,452
Please.

761
00:34:50,351 --> 00:34:52,133
Help me, please.

762
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:56,476
Please.

Help me!

I wanna see my father...

766
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,017
This... this is
5021 George, emergency.

767
00:35:22,058 --> 00:35:23,428
Shots fired.

768
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:25,541
Offender down.
Need an ambo.

769
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,421
Lower Wacker and Columbus.

770
00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:31,172
Just try to get him some help.
Get him help.

771
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:34,219
<i>Copy that.</i>

772
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:01,289
That's Jay.
That's Jay.

773
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,073
5021 Henry!
Officer down!

774
00:36:03,117 --> 00:36:05,077
I repeat, officer down.
Lower Wacker and Columbus.

775
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,469
Get us an ambulance.
Jay?

776
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:09,522
You okay?

777
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:12,170
Come on!

778
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:17,871
- It didn't go through.
- Hailey, what's going on?

779
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,481
It didn't go through.
It's okay.

780
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,396
Jay, Jay, breathe, breathe.

781
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,224
Okay.
You're okay.

782
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,168
Guys!
Can you block off the street?

783
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:29,044
Do whatever you gotta do
to get an ambulance in, now!

784
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:31,450
- All right?
- Copy that!

785
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:32,780
Okay.

786
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,522
Okay.

787
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:38,647
Okay.

788
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,616
Jay, do you hear me?

789
00:36:43,788 --> 00:36:45,485
You understand?

790
00:36:45,757 --> 00:36:46,757
Yeah.

791
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:49,077
I still need you to go to Med
to check for internal.

792
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:52,340
You have no broken ribs.
The bullet didn't hit anything.

793
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:55,213
The second bullet that got your
side was a through and through.

794
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,609
Bruising's gonna
be a bitch, though.

795
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:57,899
That pain'll knock you backwards

796
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:59,680
once the edge wears off.

797
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:02,991
You all right?

798
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:05,061
Yeah.

799
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:08,890
Damn lucky.

800
00:37:09,677 --> 00:37:11,983
- I...
- No. You are done talking.

801
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:14,181
I mean done.

802
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,915
You should be dead.

803
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:20,906
Do you get that?

804
00:37:21,845 --> 00:37:24,446
You do not disobey
a direct order from me.

805
00:37:25,728 --> 00:37:27,837
I don't care how angry you are.

806
00:37:29,129 --> 00:37:31,016
You're mourning, grieving...

807
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:33,381
man, I don't care
if your whole damn family

808
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,048
just got murdered.

809
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,655
You listen to me!

810
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,305
It's my job to keep you alive,

811
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:46,251
to look out for you.

812
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,603
I will always do my job,

813
00:37:49,399 --> 00:37:53,314
and you will always
do yours and listen.

814
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,282
That's the deal.

815
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:02,931
When your head is on straight...

816
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:07,181
we are gonna talk
about this again.

817
00:38:08,687 --> 00:38:09,797
All right.

818
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,871
Daniel?

819
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:34,868
He was pronounced at Med.

820
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,446
Antonio's with Juan and Carlos.

821
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,915
He's taking them into
protective custody.

822
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:44,923
DEA says bodies are already
dropping in Mexico, so...

823
00:38:46,587 --> 00:38:48,243
So a happy ending?

824
00:38:55,493 --> 00:38:57,626
Hailey, um...

825
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,228
I just couldn't stop myself.

826
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:20,017
Thanks, guys, appreciate it.
Thank you.

827
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,040
Hey.

828
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:27,298
- Hey.
- You all right?

829
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:30,690
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Oh.

830
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:33,548
Ah, yeah, that's the adrenaline.

831
00:39:34,459 --> 00:39:37,173
- I thought he was dead.
- Yeah, me too.

832
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:39,944
You know what?

833
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:41,840
You want to get out of here
and grab a drink?

834
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:44,181
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.
