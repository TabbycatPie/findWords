18
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,380
Previously on The Good Doctor...

19
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,500
You ready to tell me what's on your mind?

20
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,770
I think I'm in love with my boss.

21
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,000
I have rheumatoid arthritis.

22
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,300
I wanted you to know and no one else.

23
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,320
I've been thinking about synovectomy surgery.

24
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,790
- That'll resolve the pain temporarily. - Then what?

25
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,840
It'll give me at least ten years.

26
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,630
And then you're gonna be bone on bone.

27
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,040
What's your plan then?

28
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,250
I understand you're leaving surgery.

29
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,420
That's tough. But it's the right call.

30
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,640
No, I don't think it is.

31
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,380
I'm doing the surgery.

32
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,530
You don't tell me anything about your life.

33
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,330
That's because you don't want to know anything.

34
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,420
That's not true!

35
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,660
You don't want to feel guilty about being a thousand miles away.

36
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,880
You just want to know that I'm okay.

37
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,390
I love you, Lea.

38
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,490
I want to be your boyfriend.

39
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm a challenge for anyone.

40
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,130
I just know it would be too hard for you.

41
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,770
You have to give me a chance.

42
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,130
You need to let me try.

43
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,840
- No. - I will fix it!

44
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,200
Shaun, you're autistic. You can't fix that.

45
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,690
You acted like you cared about me,

46
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,960
but you don't even respect me.

47
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,820
You're going to end up alone, and you deserve it!

48
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,800
Because you're a superficial,

49
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,770
selfish, and prejudiced person!

50
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,870
Two lychee Kolsch, please.

51
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,920
Lea?

52
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,130
I saw the invite at the clinic.

53
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,470
And I assumed you wouldn't be here.

54
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,180
You with a friend?

55
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,140
Uh, it's been a rough couple of weeks.

56
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,360
They're here!

57
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,830
The guys who made this all possible!

58
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,050
I don't know about all that.

59
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,120
Yeah, well, you try opening a brewery

60
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,930
or fundraising when you're dead.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,380
Oh, honey, uh, you remember Dr. Melendez...

62
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,520
- Hi. - And Dr. Glassman.

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,710
This is my wife, Noreen.

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,860
- Aaron. - Hi.

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,470
This is Lea.

66
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,860
Your flavor profiles are epic.

67
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,420
Well, how about a tour?

68
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,930
Uh, yes.

69
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,210
Okay, great. Come on.

70
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
- Carl! - Marta.

71
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,530
It's good to see you!

72
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,070
She is in host mode. We could be here forever.

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,600
I'll show you around.

74
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,480
The, uh, hops in the Kolsch, is that the Citra?

75
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,610
In combination with the Noble German.

76
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,450
Lady knows her stuff.

77
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,120
Do you feel that?

78
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,160
It's an earthquake.

79
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,140
Get out of there!

80
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,980
Lea!

84
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,300
Hello?

85
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,350
Thank God. Are you okay?

86
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,160
Um, I'm fine, I think.

87
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,160
The ceiling caved in.

88
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,890
Were you hit? Are you bleeding?

89
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,700
Not as far as I can tell. Just...

90
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,860
Just some bruises.

91
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,610
The brewing tanks fell over.

92
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,160
One went right through the floor.

93
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,360
And Glassman? Wasn't he with you?

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,380
I was! I am!

95
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,630
Your shoulder. It's dislocated.

96
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,620
Yeah.

97
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,070
I'm okay.

98
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,250
Noreen.

99
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,960
We're okay here.

100
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,130
I'm about to assemble a HURT Team and head out.

101
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,580
Any idea how many wounded?

102
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,790
No. Let me check.

103
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,370
Come on.

104
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,420
Lea?

105
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,810
Get here as fast as you can.

106
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,630
The hospital is on mass casualty incident protocol.

107
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,060
Cancel all elective surgeries.

108
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,540
Transfer non-critical patients

109
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,610
to urgent- or chronic-care facilities.

110
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,100
No family members or visitors are allowed in the ER.

111
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,110
We're gonna need every inch of space we've got.

112
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,120
Use the waiting room for patient overflow.

113
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,770
Our HURT Team, which I'll be running,

114
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,300
has been assigned to the Bold Statement Brewery,

115
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,990
which collapsed during a charity event.

116
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,770
Melendez and Glassman went to that.

117
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:37,250
I spoke with Melendez. They're both fine.

118
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,910
That's two out of approximately a hundred.

119
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,220
Park, Shaun, Claire, you're with me.

120
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,140
Get the equipment packed up.

121
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,740
I want to be on the road in three minutes.

122
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,830
I need you to cover surgery.

123
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,270
I'll get another attending on the ER.

124
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,580
I'll do both. I used to run the whole hospital.

125
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,740
It's just a cut. You'll be fine.

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,990
I need to focus on medical emergencies.

127
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,100
Cuts and scrapes do not qualify.

128
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,730
My colleague and I will be com...

129
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,720
Lea?

130
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,560
The door to the Brew Hall is totally blocked.

131
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,400
Dr. Melendez!

132
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,830
Noreen?

133
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:22,980
Marta.

134
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,740
What hurts?

135
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,970
My back.

136
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,810
Okay, I'm gonna need a towel and some tape,

137
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,240
and Glassman and I need every first aid kit you've got.

138
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,190
Go.

139
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,560
Hold still.

140
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,170
You're gonna be okay.

141
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,060
I'm gonna stabilize that leg, sir.

142
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,190
Hold on a second.

143
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,550
Sir, please put that light on your leg.

144
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,750
What was that?

145
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,790
Just hold still.

146
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,060
What if there's an aftershock? The whole place could come down.

147
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,330
Just hold still, please, sir. Just hold still!

148
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,420
Just please sit down!

149
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,380
Hey, you guys can head across the street,

150
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,970
and you'll be okay over there.

151
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,330
There mi...

152
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,290
might be about 40 people inside in need of treatment

153
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,830
or so... some kind of onsite evaluation.

154
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,730
Where do you need me?

155
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,980
- Back at the hospital. We're short on surgeons. - Okay.

156
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,860
Shaun. Uh...

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,920
Lea...was here.

158
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,500
Where is she now?

159
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,970
I don't know. She was inside when the tanks fell down.

160
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,340
But the first responders are gonna find her. Shaun?

161
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,900
Jack's in place. Let's lift it.

162
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,000
All right, she's clear.

163
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,970
Melendez.

164
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,740
50-year-old woman,

165
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,800
medical history includes spinal tumor resection,

166
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,290
C1-through-3 fusion,

167
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,580
complaining of severe back pain.

168
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,840
Hey, where were you hit?

169
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,730
- Are you dizzy? You okay? - I'm fine.

170
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,000
A beam fell, hit me on my side, knocked me down.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,680
Let me see.

172
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,700
I'm fine.

173
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,660
Let me see.

174
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,710
I'll lay off working my obliques at the gym for a bit.

175
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,350
How much does that hurt?

176
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,440
No more than it should.

177
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,510
You're gonna need a full evaluation.

178
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,170
I'll go with Marta back to the hospital, get checked out.

179
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,150
Where was Lea?

180
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,620
In the Brew Hall, and it's completely blocked in.

181
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,620
Glassman and I already tried.

182
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,380
The danger of spinal fracture...

183
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,940
Let's get a real cervical collar on her and get her onto the board.

184
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,510
Stop!

185
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,390
Don't touch her.

186
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,870
You winced when they touched your neck.

187
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,340
Did your right hand hurt?

188
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,390
Yeah.

189
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,230
Like it was on fire.

190
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,910
It's not just a fracture.

191
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,080
Something is pressing on her spinal cord.

192
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,530
Even the move to the board could shift the object,

193
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,370
leading to permanent paralysis.

194
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,130
I need to find Lea.

195
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,960
Get the battery-powered X-ray.

196
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:43,850
Okay.

197
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,950
Lucky there weren't more books on that shelf.

198
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,080
Bay one.

199
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,670
500 milligrams IV acetaminophen,

200
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,960
and page Calderon in pedes.

201
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,010
Reznick, no.

202
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,670
You had surgery on your hands 48 hours ago.

203
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,940
I don't need them to triage.

204
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,200
We need a surgeon over here.

205
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,850
Construction worker. Through and through impalement.

206
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,290
Point of entry's his pelvis.

207
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,750
BP 111 over 84.

208
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,000
Pulse 107 BPMs.

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,550
- Pupils? - Ignore her.

210
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,670
Normal and reactive.

211
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,440
Right now she's a patient, not a doctor.

212
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,460
Motor exam?

213
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,200
- Normal. - All right. Thanks.

214
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
I'm concerned about the iliac artery.

215
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,390
You should check his femoral pulse.

216
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,480
I was planning to.

217
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,340
Okay, okay, okay.

218
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,120
Right leg is strong.

219
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,180
Left is thready.

220
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,360
Ultrasound his leg to confirm. His abdomen, too.

221
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,100
Look for additional damaged vessels.

222
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,510
Then take him to OR 2 and page Cohen.

223
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,630
There could be a lot of vascular injuries.

224
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,540
You should do his surgery while I help with triage.

225
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,060
Dr. Reznick, I don't need or want your help.

226
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,480
You have a habit of withholding key details

227
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,910
from your attendings as it benefits you.

228
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,270
Go to bed.

229
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,500
Lea?

230
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,430
Lea, can you hear me?

231
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,950
Help. Think I'm stuck.

232
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,120
Shaun, we need you on triage. Let the professionals...

233
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,160
Sh... Okay.

234
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,050
Help.

235
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:07,900
Under here.

236
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,720
Someone is down there.

237
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,310
Someone's down there, but it's not Lea.

238
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,080
We need fire and rescue over here!

239
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,990
Coming now!

240
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,280
Shaun!

241
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,170
It's right up against the spinal canal.

242
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,480
It's the C2 screws we used

243
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,790
to fuse the vertebrae once the tumor was out.

244
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,310
That doctor was right?

245
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,420
I could end up paralyzed?

246
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,970
I'm afraid so.

247
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,800
So, what are we gonna do about that?

248
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,990
We could remove the screw here.

249
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,700
No. You can't operate on my wife's spine

250
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,130
in the middle of all this.

251
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,800
It would have its risks,

252
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,270
significantly more than most surgeries,

253
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,720
but Dr. Browne's right.

254
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,580
If we don't remove the screw here,

255
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:14,570
it's very likely that you'll be paralyzed from the neck down.

256
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,310
Take it out.

257
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,340
Lea?

258
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,510
Lea?

259
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,040
Are you there?

260
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,620
Can you hear me?

261
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,560
- Lea? - Please help!

262
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,470
Lea, it's me!

263
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,200
Lea, it's Shaun! It's...

264
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,450
Lea?

265
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,570
Shaun, help!

266
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,570
Okay.

267
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,370
This area needs to be stabilized

268
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,450
before any medical personnel...

269
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,230
Lea!

270
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,900
I think I'm stuck.

271
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,590
Okay.

272
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,910
Lea. I'm coming.

273
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,880
Okay.

274
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,310
I am not afraid.

275
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,120
I am...not afraid.

276
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,760
I'm not afraid.

277
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
Of course you are.

278
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,170
You know why?

279
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,040
Because this is stupid scary.

280
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,970
Dispatch rerouted us to Good Sam for some reason.

281
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,380
Put us on diversion. Too many trauma patients, too few surgeons.

282
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,450
Now you got two more patients and one more surgeon.

283
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,670
Which procedure do you want?

284
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,920
Pelvic fracture can wait. Bay 7.

285
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,160
I'm overseeing the ER.

286
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,020
Someone has to. Doesn't have to be you.

287
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,160
Morgan texted me. She's offered to help.

288
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,590
Hands-free.

289
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,120
I'll handle the ER. You two go cut.

290
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,830
Who's gonna actually treat the patients? Siri?

291
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,500
The nurses. I'll tell them what to do

292
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,720
and then oversee every move.

293
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,090
Running this place isn't a job for a third-year,

294
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,940
even on days without an earthquake.

295
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,290
Well, we've had an earthquake. There are no options.

296
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,110
Morgan. You be careful with those hands.

297
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,850
You could screw them up for good.

298
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,680
Understood.

299
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,750
Petringa! OR 3.

300
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,230
What were you doing in a brewery, anyway?

301
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,750
I was just sitting at the bar, having a beer.

302
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,520
Now I'm trapped under it.

303
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,780
You're not 21.

304
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,680
I'd show you my ID,

305
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,450
but my pockets are kind of underground right now.

306
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,760
We should let your parents know where you are.

307
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,630
I'm fine. It doesn't even hurt.

308
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,670
I think you should have someone here... Mom, Dad.

309
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,740
My mom's dead.

310
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,070
And my dad's on a plane.

311
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,160
Do you know the flight number? We can get word to him.

312
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,240
If my son was in your situation, I'd want to be there,

313
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,510
no matter what else was going on or how he got there.

314
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,770
My dad already thinks I'm a screw-up.

315
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,520
And this doesn't exactly disprove that.

316
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,040
Just get this thing off me.

317
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,810
Call me a bitch.

318
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,720
Call me a bitch.

319
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,160
We are gonna clear this ER

320
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,120
and get the hospital off trauma diversion.

321
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,600
With a patient in every bed and one doctor with zero hands?

322
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,960
Actually, I've got eight.

323
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,840
You guys are gonna do exactly what I tell you.

324
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,440
I ask you to probe 2 inches to the left,

325
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,500
I don't mean 1.5 inches or 1.7.

326
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,590
I have you debride a wound,

327
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,230
that's three Betadine swabs, not two.

328
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,080
I don't care what shortcuts you've picked up.

329
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,980
I will not say please. It is a wasted word.

330
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,140
I will not say thank you. I will be moving on.

331
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,740
I will be a bitch, so you may as well call me one now.

332
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,360
Bitch.

333
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,990
- You're a bitch. - Bitch.

334
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,310
As a feminist, I'm really not com...

335
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,640
- Say it. - Bitch.

336
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,490
Nice.

337
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,990
Let's get to work.

338
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,590
You should be up there doing your job,

339
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,270
not down here.

340
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,710
Lea needs me.

341
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,740
No, she doesn't.

342
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,310
You think rescuing her will make her fall in love with you.

343
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,300
It won't.

344
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,880
You're...being...

345
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,130
You always said I could do...

346
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,530
Because I believed in you.

347
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,090
Right now, I don't.

348
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,950
She doesn't love you. She told you.

349
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,570
She thinks you're limited.

350
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,980
You are.

351
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,320
You're not her hero.

352
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:30,910
Please help!

353
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,260
We need a central line, endotracheal tube,

354
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,670
bag mask, portable oxygen, anesthesia...

355
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,340
We've got midazolam.

356
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,070
That combined with a morphine drip should work.

357
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,930
Okay. Noreen?

358
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,240
Don't do this surgery. Please.

359
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,910
I-I can't lose her. Not this soon.

360
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,390
M-Marta was with her husband.

361
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,110
She was miserable. She didn't know...

362
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,140
We're not the ones you need to persuade.

363
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,570
Sorry.

364
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,980
I will push your wheelchair.

365
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,270
I'll wipe your mouth, whatever you need.

366
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,120
And be glad for every minute of it

367
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,070
because...

368
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,040
You will still be alive.

369
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,630
And we'll still be on our adventure.

370
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,530
Five years.

371
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,050
That's...that's just not enough.

372
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,960
So greedy.

373
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,570
Marta, please.

374
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,350
Thank you for being willing to take care of me...

375
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,450
again.

376
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,940
Five years isn't enough.

377
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:18,040
However long I have with you will never be enough.

378
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,020
I only found you

379
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,200
once I stopped listening to my fear...

380
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,330
Fear of hurting my husband...

381
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,670
Being thrown out of the church,

382
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,830
of dying alone.

383
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,000
Pushing all that aside made room for you,

384
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,380
and you are my life.

385
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,800
Dr. Melendez saved me once.

386
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,570
He's gonna do it again.

387
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,790
Be brave with me.

388
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay.

389
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,320
You found me.

390
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,440
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

391
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,710
I'm here to help you.

392
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,390
What's your name?

393
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,350
Vera.

394
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,930
Where does it hurt, Vera?

395
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,180
Everywhere.

396
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,350
But mostly the shoulder.

397
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,650
Okay.

398
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,950
Take a deep breath, please.

399
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,670
Your lungs are fine.

400
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,440
Can you feel your hands?

401
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,060
Yes.

402
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,380
That means you have no nerve damage.

403
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,300
It missed your vital organs.

404
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,650
I can remove it without risking permanent injury.

405
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,930
That's good news.

406
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,900
This is bad.

407
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,200
When I cut, brace this.

408
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,660
Her neck cannot move at all.

409
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,330
Making initial midline incision to posterior neck.

410
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,740
It's gonna take some time before we can move that bar.

411
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,570
That's fine.

412
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:49,390
We need to get a sense of the kid's injuries before you do anything.

413
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,430
I need to get under there and take a look.

414
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,890
Follow me.

415
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,750
Asthma and dust inhalation.

416
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,110
Bad combination.

417
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,610
Take deep breaths.

418
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,700
Higher.

419
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,490
Higher.

420
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,090
Where her lungs are.

421
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,080
- You're the one that can hear them. - There.

422
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,160
Deeper.

423
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,580
Trying. Just can't.

424
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,270
That's probably because your lungs are hyperinflated.

425
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,150
Start nebulizer albuterol and oxygen,

426
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,680
eight liters per minute.

427
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,150
Why are you using plaster of Paris?

428
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,570
You told me cast her arm. You didn't tell me...

429
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,700
To use fiberglass,

430
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,770
which takes half the time and is twice as effective?

431
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,810
I wasn't aware that I had to instruct you on common sense.

432
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,400
Bitch.

433
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,460
Can I speak to Dr. Lim, please?

434
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,680
Shaun, where are you?

435
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,100
I found a woman with shoulder and leg impalements.

436
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm going to extract the shoulder,

437
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,230
but freeing the leg could sever the posterior tibial artery.

438
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,360
That sounds bad.

439
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,430
You would die.

440
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,900
What's the leg impaled on?

441
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,180
Mm, it appears to be steel rebar.

442
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,740
We'll send down a firefighter.

443
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,560
Once they've sawed through the rebar, they'll transport her up.

444
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,730
And keep this channel open so I can hear you.

445
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,160
Have they found Lea?

446
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,700
No. They're still searching.

447
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,790
Okay.

448
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:55,910
Hey, Aaron, can you head back to the ER when you finish here?

449
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,280
Not unless you can take the transected aorta

450
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,540
being prepped in OR 3.

451
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,070
I got a myocardial contusion and

452
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,250
tamponade in 2.

453
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,270
Ceiling fan fell on this guy's chest.

454
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,940
See you on the other side.

455
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,360
Yeah.

456
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,290
- We've got a bleed. - Clamp.

457
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,520
The hardware tore a muscular branch

458
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,290
of her right vertebral artery.

459
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,090
I can't find the bleed without suction.

460
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,550
I see it.

461
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,390
Her vitals are stable, but she's lost too much blood.

462
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,810
We can't keep cutting till we give her a transfusion.

463
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,620
Check all local hospitals and blood banks.

464
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,350
See who can get us O-negative, stat.

465
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,610
There might be another way to transfuse her.

466
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,620
So, I'm 16, in my dad's car,

467
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,850
a dime bag in my pocket,

468
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,080
and a cop approaching.

469
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,930
Did you get arrested?

470
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,230
Hey, let me tell the story.

471
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,690
It's got a beginning, middle, and end.

472
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,880
- I want the end. - It's better with the middle.

473
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,650
We, uh, roll down the window,

474
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,130
and the cop is hit with a cloud of smoke.

475
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,360
She makes us get out,

476
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,640
pats us both down, searches the whole car...

477
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,370
I'll be right back.

478
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,520
Oh, wait. Come on, come on. Don't leave me hanging.

479
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:23,850
Come on.

480
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,650
She didn't find anything.

481
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,580
All right.

482
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,330
Our bodies can do amazing things,

483
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,780
even hide dime bags.

484
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,610
Holy crap! No way! Did you still smoke it?

485
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,550
I'll be right back.

486
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,450
Oh, man, you did!

487
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,040
How bad is it?

488
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,790
His spine's been severed.

489
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,560
He's lost a lot of blood.

490
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,940
No femoral pulses.

491
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,380
His legs are ice cold.

492
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,340
The bar's basically cross-clamping his abdominal aorta.

493
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,970
He's gonna bleed out when we lift the bar.

494
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,270
Yeah.

495
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,360
No, there's gotta be something we can do.

496
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,070
We can get his dad here before it's too late.

497
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,810
Inject five CCs bupivacaine,

498
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,750
wait 20 minutes, then pull it out.

499
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,270
You here for me to discharge our asthmatic?

500
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,900
No, she's gotten worse.

501
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,820
And she's complaining about back pain.

502
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,440
She said she fell during the earthquake.

503
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,720
Symptom explained.

504
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,930
Those sutures need to be closer together.

505
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,810
Add budesonide to her nebulizer.

506
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,700
That should help her breathing.

507
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,270
I think she might be pregnant.

508
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,160
Shortness of breath plus back pain

509
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,580
could be UTI, kidney stones, or pregnancy.

510
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,750
Urine dip ruled out UTI and kidney stones.

511
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,250
So her symptoms have nothing to do with the earthquake?

512
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,360
It's possible.

513
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,780
How can you be both slow and sloppy?

514
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,430
This is my first time doing sutures.

515
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,500
Finish up so I can discharge him.

516
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,220
Stop with the zebra hunting.

517
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,060
Put her on budesonide and clear the bed.

518
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,970
I asked you to be my hands, not my brain.

519
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,080
Dr. Reznick.

520
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,690
I'm over the bitch plan, after three years of it.

521
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,600
We're in crisis.

522
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,020
That you are using to rehabilitate

523
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,900
your reputation with Andrews, which is fine.

524
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,430
But stop biting the hands that are your hands.

525
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,110
What are you doing?

526
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,230
Sterilizing the instrument.

527
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,360
Do you know someone with cancer?

528
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,950
I'm curious why you were at a fundraiser for cancer research.

529
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,290
I was there for a man.

530
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,000
One without cancer or any interest in being with me.

531
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,510
My ex-boyfriend is on the board of the charity.

532
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,800
Why did you want to see your ex-boyfriend?

533
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,970
I guess...

534
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,160
I hoped he'd realize he was still in love with me

535
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,980
and beg me to take him back.

536
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,990
Clever, huh?

537
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,480
I understand.

538
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,070
I still want Lea to be my girlfriend.

539
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,490
But she doesn't feel the same way?

540
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,450
I have autism.

541
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,920
Shaun, that shouldn't...

542
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,110
Why didn't you warn me?

543
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,520
Studies have shown that anticipation only heightens pain.

544
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:54,400
I used small talk to distract you.

545
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,540
Where did you two meet?

546
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,460
Church.

547
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
I'm not a member anymore.

548
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,300
Okay.

549
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,680
Place that in the surgical cavity.

550
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,770
You made a cell saver out of a...

551
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,060
Beer engine.

552
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,100
I ran alcohol through it to sterilize it.

553
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,940
Attach this to an IV.

554
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,070
We are gonna pump her own blood back into her.

555
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,040
Hey, we got somebody down here!

556
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,130
Can you hear us? We're coming!

557
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,610
Lea. Are you okay?

558
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,930
I-I think so.

559
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,400
How long before you guys get this thing off of me?

560
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,110
We're working on it.

561
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,710
You said your dad thinks you're a screw-up?

562
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,550
Has he actually said that?

563
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:45,510
No.

564
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,850
The reason I told you that story is

565
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,270
everyone does dumb stuff when they're a teenager.

566
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,040
I bet your dad doesn't judge you nearly as harshly

567
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,230
as you think he does.

568
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,490
My dad doesn't know me.

569
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,650
Neither do you.

570
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,250
Can you stay with him?

571
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,470
That's... incredible.

572
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,890
Thank you.

573
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,990
Spend enough time around Dr. Browne,

574
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,560
you get used to incredible.

575
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,780
Okay. Thank you.

576
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,010
There'll be a cruiser waiting to pick Casey's dad up

577
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,620
when he lands in three hours.

578
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,310
What if we compress Casey's aorta against his spine

579
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,290
and create a higher cross-clamp?

580
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,210
You didn't tell him yet, did you?

581
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,590
No.

582
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,360
We could buy time

583
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,640
to repair his aorta after we lift the bar.

584
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,780
Casey's about Kellan's age.

585
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,560
This has nothing to do with Kellan.

586
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,830
Yes, it's... it's a 1% chance of success if we do this,

587
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,520
against a 100% chance of death if we don't.

588
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,400
Okay.

589
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,740
Prep him.

590
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,580
When will we know if she's gonna be okay?

591
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,330
When she wakes up.

592
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,350
And there's still a risk of infection.

593
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,170
Let's get her stabilized and out of here.

594
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,820
I'm administering the budesonide

595
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,720
and checking to see if she's pregnant.

596
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,080
I told her I'm on the pill.

597
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,270
Ever miss a day?

598
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,570
Look at that. An unoccupied uterus.

599
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,080
Prep her for discharge.

600
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,280
Can you give me something for my back pain?

601
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
It's bruised from when you fell in the earthquake.

602
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,200
Take some Tylenol.

603
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,030
Uh, it's been bad all week.

604
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,120
Muscle relaxers usually help.

605
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,420
Check her tubes.

606
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,300
You're pregnant.

607
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,200
The fetus is developing inside your fallopian tube.

608
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,270
It's called an ectopic pregnancy. It's not viable.

609
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,390
That's a relief.

610
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,040
But if your fallopian tube ruptures,

611
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,620
it can cause a serious, possibly fatal, bleed.

612
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,460
So we'll get you into surgery as soon as possible

613
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,940
to make sure that doesn't happen.

614
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,910
It's gonna be fine.

615
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,540
If we get out of this alive,

616
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,800
let's promise to move on.

617
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,720
You can do better than Lea.

618
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,060
Not that I have any business suggesting that.

619
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,100
I might die because I'm still hung up on Paul.

620
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,040
No.

621
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,400
I don't want to move on.

622
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,670
If she doesn't feel like...

623
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:37,490
I always knew I could be a good doctor.

624
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,990
But until I met Lea,

625
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,250
I never knew I could drive a car.

626
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,180
Or enjoy music.

627
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,190
Or sing karaoke.

628
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,420
Or take tequila shots.

629
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,260
Or fall in love.

630
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:08,980
I don't want to stop being the person I am with her.

631
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,400
Lea makes me more.

632
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,290
But I don't make her more.

633
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,750
If I did,

634
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,590
then Lea would want to be my girlfriend.

635
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,410
She's tachycardic and hypotensive.

636
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,830
Abdomen?

637
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,180
Rigid.

638
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,830
Her fallopian tube ruptured.

639
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,010
Any chance he can wait an hour?

640
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,180
Rapidly expanding subdermal hematoma.

641
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,250
It still doesn't hurt. Can't this wait?

642
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,510
We need to fix something right away.

643
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,010
Okay.

644
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,680
Whatever you gotta do, I guess.

645
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,950
About my dad...

646
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,020
The minute he lands, we'll get him here.

647
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,690
Thank you.

648
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,780
Okay.

649
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,120
She needs a surgeon... Stat.

650
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,880
I'm a surgeon.

651
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,100
Harmonic scalpel, DeBakey forceps,

652
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,380
two Yankauer suctions, and vasopressin.

653
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,950
Marta?

654
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,910
Can you squeeze Noreen's hand?

655
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,750
Let's get you to the hospital.

656
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,840
You two, free beer for life.

657
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,550
- Watch it! - Aftershock!

658
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,100
We need to immobilize your leg.

659
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,890
Cover your head.

660
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,740
All right, get her out of here.

661
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,630
That was a big one.

662
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,420
Are you okay?

663
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,510
Yeah.

664
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,840
Just a little... a little motion...

665
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,640
I need oxygen here now!

666
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:23,070
You okay?

667
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,170
What about our patient?

668
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,360
Vitals stable.

669
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,700
Shaun, you okay down there?

670
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,910
I am okay.

671
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,410
Except for the water.

672
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,010
Please hurry.

673
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:03,400
Please hurry!
