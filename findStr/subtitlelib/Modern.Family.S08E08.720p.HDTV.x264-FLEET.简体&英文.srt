很棒的决定  亲爱的
Great call, honey.

36
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,180
离它远点
Stay away from it.

37
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,400
这是给大家今晚吃的
It's for everybody tonight.

38
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,570
还得等两餐呢
That's two meals away.

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,180
喂
Hello.

40
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,970
上校  怎么了
Hey, Colonel, what's up?

41
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,880
妈咪  伊凡能来吃晚餐吗
Mommy, could Ivan come for dinner?

42
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,770
不行  先生
No, senor,

43
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,400
因为今晚全家人
'cause tonight the whole family

44
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,750
都会来吃晚餐
is coming over for dinner,

45
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,130
因为我们要投票决定
'cause we're gonna vote on

46
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,030
我们今年要去哪里度假
where we're going on vacation this year.

47
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,470
一场由道德污点的投票
A vote with a moral stain on it,

48
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,810
只有拥有土地的成年人才有投票权
since ballots are reserved for land-owning adults.

49
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,590
因为没人想去
Because nobody wants to go

50
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,110
小说家埃德加·爱伦·坡的出生地
to the birthplace of Edgar Allan Poe.

51
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,510
该死的上校害死我了
Damn Colonel screwed me

52
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,350
撤回我请愿书上他的名字
and took his name off my petition.

53
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,670
我想废除俱乐部通过的愚蠢规定
I'm trying to overturn this dumb rule the club passed

54
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,280
在正厅40英尺范围内禁止抽雪茄
banning cigars within 40 feet of the main lodge.

55
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,070
我的国家通过
When my country passed a law

56
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,410
一项允许人民淹死14岁的孩子的法律时
that allowed them to drown 14 year olds,

57
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,260
你说"这种事时有发生"
you said, "These things happen."

58
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,350
我刚买了一盒征服者特别雪茄
I just bought a box of El Conquistador Especiales.

59
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,030
它们应该被人坐在上等皮椅上抽
And they deserve to be smoked in a fine leather chair,

60
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,550
而不是在蜘蛛满地爬区域的喷泉旁边抽
not out by the fountain in some heavily-spidered area.

61
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,110
我不希望家里有这个
I don't want this in my house.

62
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,110
在家没法抽  在俱乐部没法抽
Can't smoke at home, can't smoke at the club.

63
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,690
也许斯黛拉的狗窝里有地方
Maybe Stella has room in her doghouse.

64
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,560
她在哪里
Where is she, anyway?

65
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,030
从早上开始就没见她了
Haven't seen her since the morning.

66
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,100
我不知道斯黛拉在哪里
I don't know where Stella is.

67
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,480
我觉得这跟
I think it has something to do

68
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,250
我不得不给她戴的电击项圈有关
with the shock collar that I had to put on her

69
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,040
因为她整天乱往外跑
because she kept running away.

70
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,570
也许我可以告诉杰  我以为那是条项链
Maybe I tell Jay that I thought it was a necklace.

71
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,970
他自己可是也想过给她打耳洞呢
He was the one who wanted to pierce her ears.

72
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,420
亲爱的  你的早餐在桌上了
Hey sweetie, your breakfast is on the table.

73
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,500
这是什么
Ah, what's this?

74
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,570
让我猜猜
Oh! Ooh, let me guess.

75
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,810
古龙香水广告里的人吗
The guy in the cologne ad.

76
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,370
我给意大利帅哥取了名  叫乔瓦尼
I've named him. It's Giovanni.

77
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,480
他爱上了我
He's in love with me.

78
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,580
他要为了我离开你
Well, he's leaving you for me.

79
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,490
抱歉
I'm sorry.

80
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,140
我们不想这样的
We never meant for it to happen.

81
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,230
那是什么
What's that?

82
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,120
-是吐司做好了  -租了楼上房间的
- Toast, toast is done. - Those Russian brothers

83
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,690
俄罗斯兄弟
who are renting the unit upstairs,

84
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,330
-他们  -走了
- are they... - Gone.

85
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,600
因为已经到了30天
Because it's already been 30 days, okay?

86
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,920
规定很清楚
And the rules are very clear.

87
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,250
我知道占屋者权  米奇尔
I know all about squatter's rights, Mitchell.

88
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,050
{\an8}又称不动产权  美国部分州可以合法占屋子
占够久还能变业主

89
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,050
你为什么总是得把我当做
Why do you always have to treat me

90
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,590
不负责任的...
like I'm some irresponsible...

91
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,650
蠢货
Idiot?

92
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,820
俄罗斯兄弟还想住一晚
The Russian brothers wanted one more night.

93
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,660
所以我收了现金  没告诉米奇尔
So I took cash, and I didn't tell Mitchell,

94
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,060
现在他们不肯走了
and now they won't leave.

95
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,930
我们碰到了非法占屋者
We have squatters.

96
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,030
一开始是白蚁  现在是非法占屋者
First termites, now squatters.

97
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,860
至少入侵的白蚁不是我的错
At least the termites weren't my fault.

98
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,330
瞧瞧这美丽的小桌
Look at this beautiful side table

99
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,010
有人把它丢到了街上
somebody just left on the street.

100
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,220
-需要帮忙吗  -不用  这个小桌轻到莫名其妙
- Oh, do you need a hand? - No, it's like ridiculously light.

101
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,460
给我爱人[意语]的煎饼
Flapjacks for mi amore?

102
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,760
-谢谢[意语]  -我不知道什么更甜如糖浆
- Oh, grazie. - Ugh. I don't know what's more syrupy --

103
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,320
你俩还是卢克的下巴
you two or Luke's chin.

104
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,270
真奇怪  我还没吃早餐呢
That's weird. I haven't had breakfast yet.

105
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,110
很抱歉
You'll have to excuse us.

106
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,250
你爸爸和我
Your father and I watched

107
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,150
昨晚看了一部很浪漫的电影
a very romantic movie last night.

108
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,270
好  谷歌
Okay, Google,

109
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,620
播放《给佩佩的意面》的原声音乐
play the soundtrack to "Spaghetti for Pepe."

110
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,320
播放中
Playing soundtrack.

111
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,360
抱歉
Ooh. Mi scusa.

112
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,670
-看着点新鞋  -什么
- Whoa. Watch the new kicks. - What?

113
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,730
你又买了一双新运动鞋吗
You have another pair of new sneakers?

114
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,510
俱乐部的工作薪水多少啊
What is that job at the club paying you?

115
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,540
是小费  妈妈
It's the tips, mom.

116
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,530
有位女士
There's this one lady,

117
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,130
帮她扶着门  十块
hold the door for her -- 10 bucks.

118
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,390
端给她一杯柠檬冰茶  又是十块
Bring her an ice tea with lemon, another 10 bucks.

119
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,200
我拿过的最多小费是
Best tips I ever made was when we passed the hat

120
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,020
我的即兴表演团队"三法则"表演募捐到的
after a performance of my improv group, "Rule of Three."

121
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,300
我们以小品  搞笑改编歌曲
We were known for our sketches, song parodies,

122
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,870
和正面全裸闻名
and full-frontal nudity.

123
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,770
喂
Hello?

124
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,620
你们都没有橙汁了
You are all out of orange juice.

125
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,630
我懂了
I understand.

126
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,430
我得出去买橙汁了
I have to go out for orange juice.

127
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,200
我懂了
Yes, I understand.

128
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,470
我得出去买橙汁了
I have to go out for orange juice.

129
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,060
米奇尔
Mitchell?

130
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,320
我得出去买橙汁了
I have to go out for orange juice.

131
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,530
谢谢你们过来  我跟俄罗斯人之间出了问题
Thank you for coming. I have a problem with Russians.

132
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,380
跟普里契特家族的人结婚挺好的
Being married to a Pritchett is great.

133
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,160
-非常好  -太棒了
- So great! - The best!

134
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,400
但他们有点爱批评
But they can be a -- a tad judgmental.

135
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,510
-简直是惩罚  -他们是禽兽
- Almost punitive. - They are monsters.

136
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,070
所以我们三个人组建了秘密同盟
That's why the three of us formed a -- a secret alliance

137
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,840
来掩护彼此之间的
to help each other cover up our --

138
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,580
-小错误  -比如去年十二月的时候
- our little mistakes. - Like back in December,

139
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,530
我一时冲动为开放日乱买了一个
when I hastily purchased an expensive prop

140
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,840
昂贵的道具
for an open house.

141
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,810
非常感谢你帮忙我藏它
Thanks so much for hiding it.

142
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,850
克莱尔会杀了我的
Claire would kill me.

143
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,700
等到周一我就能退掉了
And it's only till Monday, when I can return it.

144
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,640
别担心
Don't worry.

145
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,930
欢迎回家
Oh, welcome home!

146
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,710
-你回来得真早啊  -没有吧
- You're so early, right? - Not really.

147
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,770
我就爱你这样的笑容
There is that smile that I love.

148
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,870
-你带我出去共进午餐吧  -好
- Why don't you take me to lunch? - Okay.

149
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,940
到底是什么情况
What happened here, anyway?

150
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,420
你又吸乔的香味马克笔吸嗨了吗
You get into Joe's scented markers again?

151
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,410
所以现在有可怕的俄国人在我家赖着不肯走
So now, I have scary Russian squatters who won't leave.

152
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,050
等米奇尔去健身房  我们就有一小段时间
We'll have a small window when Mitchell goes to the gym.

153
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,380
他通常会做做伸展运动  在更衣室溜一圈
He usually stretches, takes a lap around the locker room,

154
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,390
然后喝杯奶昔
and then gets a smoothie.

155
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,590
你们俩负责那些俄国人
You two deal with the Russians,

156
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,730
我来转移米奇注意
and I'll keep Mitch distracted.

157
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,200
-还有事吗  -有
- Anything else? - Yes.

158
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,370
我们家门坏了
Our gate is broken,

159
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,580
斯黛拉不停跑到街上去
and Stella keeps getting out in the street.

160
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,290
我给它买了一个电击项圈
I bought her a shock collar.

161
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,930
卢克小时候我也想过买一个
I thought about getting one when Luke was younger.

162
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,150
结果克莱尔靠对他摇零钱罐让他乖乖过来
Claire ended up just shaking a can of pennies at him.

163
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,790
它被吓到  躲了起来
It spooked her and she's hiding.

164
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,600
我们得在杰之前找到它  免得杰看到项圈
We need to find her before Jay does and sees the collar.

165
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,820
他多次警告我不要买
He has warned me many times not to get one

166
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,940
因为那很残忍
because they are cruel.

167
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,540
好  我们先解决俄国人
All right, we'll deal with the Russians first,

168
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,410
然后在投票前找到斯黛拉
then come find Stella before the big vote.

169
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,630
我们时间不多
We do not have much time.

170
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,550
得行动了
We need to go.

171
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,190
其实我点了三明治
I actually ordered a sandwich.

172
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,170
雷纳还没来吗
Is Rainer not here yet?

173
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,060
不  他来了
Oh no, he is.

174
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,400
我都没要  他就给我签了张大头照
He, uh, signed a head shot I didn't ask for,

175
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,040
然后去了洗手间
and then went to the bathroom.

176
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,180
那是他女儿
There's his daughter.

177
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,910
我从未认识过男友的女儿
I've never met a boyfriend's daughter before.

178
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,390
虽然我和史黛西的老爸约会过
I mean, I went out with Stacy's dad,

179
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,020
但我从幼儿园就认识她了
but I've known her since, like, kindergarten.

180
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,770
你紧张吗
You're nervous?

181
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,780
这还能出什么岔子
I mean, how could this go wrong?

182
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,400
她是青少女  而你人生巅峰就是在那段期间
She's a teenage girl. That's when you peaked.

183
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,250
我知道
I know.

184
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,760
大概我真的很喜欢他
I guess I just really like this guy,

185
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,750
我想让他看到
and I want to be able to show him

186
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,310
我能融入他生活中最复杂的部分
I can fit into the more complicated parts of his life.

187
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,200
小公主
Hey, princess.

188
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,690
六个人拍我跟女交警争论
Six people filmed me arguing with that meter maid,

189
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,690
却没人拍到这美秒的时刻吗
and no one caught this adorable moment?

190
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,540
你肯定就是艾普丽了
So, you must be April.

191
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,320
废话
Uh, yeah?

192
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,990
艾普丽  注意语气
April, tone.

193
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,670
我搬个椅子过来
I'll grab a chair.

194
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,010
抱歉  工作电话  必须得接
Sorry. That's work. Gotta take that.

195
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,420
总之  我是海莉  你爸的...
Anyways, I'm Haley, your dad's, uh --

196
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,750
-最新一任  -太好了
- Latest? - Yes!

197
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,740
莫哈维突发洪水  需要我去报道
Flash flood in the Mohave, they need me to cover.

198
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,440
老年中心水已经上升到坡道
The water's already ramp high at the senior center.

199
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,030
一只小狗乘着披萨盒漂过
You know, a puppy floats by on a pizza box,

200
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,460
这报道可能轰动全国
this could be national.

201
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,180
糟了  我们今天的安排怎么办
Oops, snakes. Our day!

202
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,580
我可以去妈和杰夫那里
I'll just go to mom and Jeff's.

203
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,140
别别  我们今天本该互相认识一下的
No, no, we were supposed to get to know each other today.

204
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,560
我能看着你
Um, I can watch you.

205
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,490
因为我四岁吗
Because I'm 4?

206
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,570
注意语气
Oh, tone.

207
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,390
你确定吗
Are you sure?

208
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,090
当然  我们俩女孩一起玩  晚点见
Yes. Girls day. We'll meet you later.

209
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,680
好  谢谢你的理解  宝贝
Oh, okay, thank you for understanding, sweetie.

210
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,110
-没什么  -没什么
- No problem. - No problem.

211
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,680
灾难袭来
Tragedy strikes.

212
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,900
数十人死亡
Dozens dead.

213
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,260
灾难袭来
Tragedy strikes.

214
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,140
数十人死亡
Dozens dead.

215
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,250
我们最后一项议程是
And our final order of business is

216
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,530
参加今年的国际衣橱博览会
our entry to this year's Expo Internacional du Closet.

217
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,530
有什么提议
What do we got?

218
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,940
我们都知道
Okay, so we all know

219
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,350
欧洲人喜欢有力又简单的线条
that Europeans prefer strong but simple lines...

220
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,420
所以我认为我们应该选择特拉法加
which is why I think that we should go with the Trafalgar.

221
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,690
有点意思
Interesting.

222
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,010
坚实又可靠
It's sturdy, dependable.

223
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,940
另一方面
On the other hand,

224
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,800
马特洪峰可能会是颠覆性的选择
the Matterhorn is a chance to shake things up.

225
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,690
想想02年丹麦人的成绩
Think about what the Danes did in '02.

226
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,490
也有道理
Also valid.

227
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,620
大胆而创新
It's bold, innovative.

228
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,460
我得接个电话
Ah, gotta take this.

229
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,950
俱乐部的民权问题  我得处理
Civil rights issue over at the club I have to deal with.

230
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,730
你好
Hello.

231
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,910
有什么好笑的
What's so funny?

232
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,660
你们在笑什么
What are you laughing at?

233
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,650
你第一次参展这么紧张很可爱
It's so cute how nervous you are about your first expo.

234
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,010
每次我们提出个想法
It's like every time we throw out an idea,

235
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,380
你都得看你爸是怎么想的
you have to look to see what your dad is thinking.

236
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,420
我才没有
I don't do that.

237
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,940
我完全没有那样  多米
I-I-I don't do that at all, Dom.

238
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,220
或许你对你爸是那样
Maybe you do that with your dad.

239
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,120
盖里非要我签他的请愿书才会签我的
Gary won't sign my petition unless I sign his.

240
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,710
除非火焰地狱变成酷寒极地
It'll be a cold day in hell before that

241
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,720
否则他别想穿人字拖打高尔夫
hippie tees off in flip-flops.

242
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,660
我们谈到哪了
Where were we?

243
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,050
我正在纠结该选择
I was just about to make my decision

244
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,390
特拉法加  还是马特洪峰
between the Trafalgar and the Matterhorn.

245
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,240
我身着帅气西服  有最赞的办公室
I got the power suit, the corner office.

246
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,060
这城市所安装的任何新衣柜
A closet doesn't get installed in this town

247
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,710
都得本后知情了才能开工
without me knowing about it.

248
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,980
但一碰上重要的决定
But one important decision,

249
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,110
突然间  我就变成穿小皮鞋头顶小辫
and suddenly I'm this pig-tailed little girl in Mary Janes

250
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,040
渴望被爸爸夸奖聪明的小女孩了
looking to daddy to tell me I'm smart.

251
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,390
现在做这重要的决定有些为时过早
Uh, it's...too important a decision to make right now.

252
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,690
我还是多花点时间考虑一下吧
I'm just gonna take the rest of the day to think about it.

253
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,420
但必须在五点前回复慕尼黑
Okay, but Munich needs to know by 5:00.

254
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,860
我知道  但这是个艰难的选择
I know, but this is a tough choice.

255
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,840
是吗
Is it?

256
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:32,380
我带了你今晚的衣服来
Hey, I brought your clothes for tonight.

257
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,400
谢谢  亲爱的  你真是贴心小棉袄
Oh, thank you honey, that's so sweet.

258
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,400
-事情怎么样...  -无线网登不上
- How's it going with, um... - The wi-fi won't work,

259
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,390
而且这地方闻起来全是方便面味儿
and this whole place smells like Cup O' Noodles.

260
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,750
妈妈  这是艾普丽  雷纳的女儿
Mom, this is April, Rainer's daughter.

261
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,410
-很高兴见到你  -你好
- Pleasure to meet you. - Hi.

262
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,120
我想去下洗手间
So, I'm gonna look for a ladies' room.

263
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,500
工厂里有洗手间吗
Do they have those in factories?

264
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,380
有的  走廊尽头就是
Uh, we do, yes. It's just down the hall.

265
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,170
走廊尽头就是
Just down the hall.

266
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,670
谢谢啊  应声虫
Thanks, echo.

267
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,740
你笑什么
What's so funny?

268
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,460
看你得管着一个青少女觉得好笑
Oh, just you dealing with a teenage girl.

269
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,000
没想象中那么简单吧
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

270
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,020
不好意思  我管得可好了
Excuse me. I'm doing just fine.

271
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,960
好啊  孩子们
Hey, kiddo.

272
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,430
今晚重要的假期投票你来吗
We gonna see you tonight for the big vacation vote?

273
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,030
那当然  介意我带个烦死人的青少女吗
You bet. Mind if I bring an unbearable teenager?

274
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,070
多一个又何妨
What's one more.

275
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,870
听着  我要去俱乐部一趟
Listen, I'm gonna run over to the club

276
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,620
为我的雪茄请愿书凑到最后一个签名
and scare up one last signature for my cigar petition.

277
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,890
你决定好选哪个衣柜参加博览会了吗
Oh, have you decided on what closet for the expo?

278
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,570
因为我在想...
'Cause I was thinking --

279
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,970
不不不  不用了  谢谢
No! No, no, no. No, thank you.

280
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,870
我做好决定时  一定会告知你的
I will let you know when I have made my decision.

281
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,920
没问题  三明治看起来挺好吃
Sure. Sandwich looks good.

282
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,970
是吗  你觉得挺好吃吗
Does it? Does it look good to you?

283
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,590
你觉得不意味就真的好吃
'Cause that doesn't mean it's a good sandwich.

284
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,650
没错  这三明治一点也不好吃
It's not. As a matter of fact, it's not a good sandwich.

285
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,930
好吧  大家今晚见
All right, see you guys later tonight.

286
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,990
-你就捡回来吧  -好的
- Just do it. - Okay.

287
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,590
卢克
Luke?

288
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:38,870
小家伙
Buddy?

289
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,710
凯文  刚上那上车的是不是我孙子
Kevin, was that my grandson taking off in that sportscar?

290
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,980
是啊  没错
Yeah, it was.

291
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,970
你这么贼兮兮地回答  到底怎么回事
That's quite a spin on that response. What's going on?

292
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,220
玛吉·布雷斯韦特派给了他一些她家里的活
Maggie Braithwait has some work for him to do around her house.

293
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,370
她比较中意小鲜肉
She's got an eye for the young ones. 

294
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,520
我该担心吗
Should I be worried?

295
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,700
她也许会尝试对他下手
She might try and pressure him a little,

296
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,310
但卢克是个聪明孩子  对吗
but Luke's a smart kid, right?

297
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,860
我靠
Damn it.

298
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,980
谢天谢地你来了
Oh, thank God you're here.

299
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,310
我能听见楼上的俄国人嘲笑民主政治
I can hear the Russians upstairs laughing at democracy.

300
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,420
-我们一起上去吧  -不  我单独行动
- All right, shall we? - No. I work alone.

301
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,610
如果你听见两声身体撞地  就是解决了
If you hear two bodies hit the floor, it's done.

302
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,020
要是听见第三声  就赶紧找后援
If you hear three, one tried to get back up.

303
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,450
好吧
Okay...

304
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,790
真对不起
I'm so sorry!

305
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,540
菲尔

306
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,200
米奇尔
Mitchell!

307
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,810
真是巧啊  你来这家健身房健身吗
Wow, that's crazy. Is -- is this your gym?

308
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,890
没错
Yeah.

309
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,330
我正准备去邮局呢
I was just heading into the post office.

310
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,980
你介意陪我一起吗  他们办事很快的
You mind keeping me company? They're always quick.

311
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,490
其实呢  我要去...
Oh, well, actually, I gotta --

312
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,030
我的钥匙不见了
I don't have my keys.

313
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,360
我一定是丢哪里了
Oh, I must have dropped them.

314
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,290
真糟糕  我可以帮你到健身房找找
Oh, no. Well, I'll -- I'll help you check the gym.

315
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,910
你还记得用过哪些健身器材吗
You remember what machines you were using?

316
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,430
全部
All of them.

317
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,500
我们搜索遍了整个健身房
We scoured that gym.

318
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,060
其实还真花了相当长的时间
It actually did take a crazy long time,

319
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,030
因为米奇尔一直迷路
because Mitchell kept getting lost.

320
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,320
但我还需要再拖延一会儿
But I still needed a little more time.

321
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,570
抱歉耽误了你这么久
Sorry that took so long.

322
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,580
一碰上图书馆旧书清仓我就走不动道
I can't pass up a library book sale.

323
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,480
只要一美元就能买到塞满车后箱的杂志
I mean, a dollar for as many magazines as you can fit in the car.

324
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,430
没错  《国家地理》
Yeah, National Geo--

325
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,760
《爱尔兰  蛮夷的土地》
Ireland: Land of Savages.

326
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,140
这事多少年前出版的啊
How old are these?

327
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,720
-你好  亲爱的  -菲尔
- Hi, honey. - Hey, Phil,

328
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,700
我知道今早你已经去过超市买橙汁了
I know you already went to the store for O.J. This morning,

329
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,510
但你回来路上能再去买点红酒晚上喝吗
but can you go back and grab some wine for tonight?

330
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,080
没问题  再见  美女
You got it. Ciao, bella.

331
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,620
你今早去买橙汁了吗
You went out for orange juice this morning?

332
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,740
真巧  小卡也是
That's a coincidence. Cam did too.

333
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,060
的确是巧  那...  那真是
That is a coincidence. That's -- that's really...

334
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,200
你好

335
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,890
有何贵干

336
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,540
每天我都会带乔去一个在俄罗斯社区的公园
Every day, I take Joe to a park in a Russian neighborhood.

337
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,540
我们很喜欢去那里
We like it there.

338
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,270
那些俄国保姆管教俄国娃时
I have picked up a few phrases

339
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,860
我学会了一些俄语短语
that the Russian nannies tell to the Russian kids.

340
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,250
游戏时间结束了

341
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:26,980
你谁

342
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,830
你们两个坏小子  到该回家的时候了

343
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,940
你觉得她是真有来头吗

344
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,500
长这么漂亮还会说俄语的女人肯定有后台

345
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,660
和朋友们说再见吧  到小睡的时间了

346
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,960
她肯定认识"屠夫"

347
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,910
我很肯定咱们能把事情商量妥的

348
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,650
难道你们想尝尝炸鸡柳的滋味吗

349
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,660
女王饶命  别把我的手炸成鸡柳

350
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,160
其实很简单的  米奇
Well, it's pretty simple, Mitch.

351
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,310
你只要乱摸一通
You just touch everything,

352
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,890
等开拖车的人来了
and then when the tow truck guy shows up

353
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,270
看到你满手油污就会觉得你是行家
and sees your dirty paws, he knows you're a pro.

354
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,920
还要尽可能多说"风扇传动皮带"
Also, say "fan belt" as often as you...

355
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,110
米奇尔
Mitchell?

356
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,280
米奇尔
Mitchell?

357
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:05,700
是我
Hello.

358
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,020
红熊猫已逃离动物园
The red panda's left the zoo.

359
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,080
-什么红熊猫  -米奇尔的代号
- Red panda? - Mitchell's code name!

360
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,360
我已经尽可能拖住他了  还是被他跑了
I stalled him for as long as I could, and he got away.

361
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
-那我还有多少时间  -我也不知道
- Okay, well, how much time do I have? - I'm not sure.

362
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,280
我都不知道我现在在哪
I don't really know where I am.

363
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,230
我只能看见
All I can see is --

364
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,040
-原来就在你家旁边  -什么
- Oh, there's your house. - What?

365
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,960
-小卡  -回来啦  甜心
- Cam. - Hi, sweetheart!

366
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,840
少用你那套《乱世佳人》的南方风情迷惑我
Save the Southern charm, Scarlett.

367
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,420
-菲尔明显是想阻止我回家来  -什么
- Phil was clearly just trying to keep me from here. - What?

368
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,290
我先是丢了钥匙
Yeah, I-I lost my keys,

369
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,150
然后他就突然出现
and sudden-suddenly he shows up and --

370
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,510
这是不是和我们早上听到的
Does this have something to do

371
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,900
楼上传来的撞击声有什么关系
with the thud we heard upstairs?

372
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,320
米奇尔  我这话是带着爱意说的
Mitchell, I-I say this with love,

373
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,250
但你这是纯脑子抽风啊
but you're coming unhinged.

374
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,960
你对我的这些怀疑  这些指控
The suspicions, the accusations,

375
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,850
滚床单时机械化的表现
the mechanical sexual performance --

376
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,810
我心爱的米奇尔哪去了
Where has Mitchell gone?

377
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,150
但我又不是医生
Yeah, I'm -- but I'm not a doctor,

378
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,540
所以你要是非说楼上有事情不对
so if you think something's going on upstairs,

379
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,940
那咱务必上去看个清楚
by all means, let's go take a look.

380
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,010
可话说回来
You know, on the other hand,

381
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,490
假如我是名医生  我会说
if I were a doctor, I would say,

382
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,880
"你编出这么多阴谋论是怎么回事"
"What's up with all the conspiracy theories?"

383
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,250
你这是教科书般的偏执狂啊
It's textbook paranoia.

384
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,020
人人都这么说
Everyone's talking about it.

385
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,220
但话又说回来  我不是医生
But again, not a doctor,

386
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,710
咱这就上楼吧
so shall we?

387
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,830
你知道在俄语里
Well, you know, there are 30 different ways

388
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,680
有30种方式说"对不起"吗
to say "I'm sorry" in Russian.

389
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

390
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,550
或许的确是我多疑了
Maybe I was being paranoid.

391
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,640
我接受你的道歉
Apology accepted,

392
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,580
我也很抱歉我说你床上技巧机械化
and I'm sorry for calling your lovemaking mechanical.

393
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,360
我其实很喜欢你那个害羞教师的角色扮演
I actually really like your shy, school teacher character.

394
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,000
征服者特别雪茄
El Conquistador Especial.

395
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,250
我爸抽的牌子
My dad's brand.

396
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,400
但我不明白上面为什么会有唇膏
That doesn't explain the lipstick, though.

397
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,790
我爸连润唇膏都不肯用
No, my dad won't even wear Chapstick.

398
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,630
他说爷们擦多了会变基
He says it's a gateway balm.

399
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,240
-外公  -我天
- Grandpa? - Oh, geez.

400
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,570
我就知道我应该闯那个黄灯来阻止
I knew I should have run that yellow.

401
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,540
你上衣呢
Where's your shirt?

402
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,520
布雷斯韦特女士想让我搬几个箱子
Mrs. Braithwait wanted me to move some boxes,

403
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,690
她叫我脱掉上衣以免弄脏衣服
and told me to take it off so it didn't get dirty.

404
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,630
但我还是觉得自己变得"肮脏"了
But I kinda feel dirty anyway.

405
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,100
去拿衣服  我们这就走
Grab your shirt. We're leaving.

406
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,100
卢克  把你那条脏脏的紧身裤脱下来洗洗吧
Luke, let's get those dirty, tight pants in the wash.

407
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,790
幸会
Oh, hello.

408
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,480
你好
How are ya?

409
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,810
我是来接我刚满18岁的外孙的
I'm here to pick up my barely-legal grandson.

410
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,960
我认得你
I recognize you.

411
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,850
你也是俱乐部的  对吧
From the club, right?

412
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,840
你就是那反抗新的白痴禁雪茄令的家伙
You're the one fighting that silly new cigar rule.

413
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,680
不好意思  你把我上衣放哪了
Excuse me? Where'd you put my shirt?

414
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,590
让我们单独聊聊  孩子
Give us a minute, kid.

415
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,120
那条禁雪茄令的确很蠢  不是吗
It is a dumb rule, isn't it?

416
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,080
蠢到家了
It's terrible.

417
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,950
我已故的前夫最爱在正厅里抽了
My late husband loved smoking in the main lodge.

418
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,420
你逼我喷的古龙水就是他的吗
Is that whose cologne you made me put on?

419
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,120
行了行了  你不是还有箱子要搬吗
Hey, hey, hey. Boxes, right?

420
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,700
我这里有份请愿书
I've got a petition here.

421
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,610
不如你瞟一眼
Why don't you read it quick?

422
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,630
你没准愿意签名呢
You might want to sign it.

423
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,200
我觉得现在可能不是时候
Oh, I'm not sure now's such a good time.

424
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,910
我这脖子
My neck is so...

425
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,890
卢克  还不伺候着
Luke, get in there.

426
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,320
施展一下你双手的魔力
Put your magic fingers to work.

427
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,320
你怎么这么了解我身体的需求
Mm. How do you know my body this well?

428
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,100
就签在那个X上
Right there on the "X."

429
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,180
你看起来够放松了
Oh, you seem relaxed.

430
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,980
我该停手了
I should stop.

431
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,470
再揉一会儿
Not just yet.

432
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,560
为了方便您
If it would be easier,

433
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,220
您握着笔就好
just hold the pen,

434
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,870
我来帮您挪纸
and I will move the paper underneath.

435
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,890
我要是知道你手法这么好
If I'd have known you were this good,

436
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,590
我就让你帮我揉脚了
I would have had you do my feet.

437
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,350
他会揉到脚的
He's gonna get there.

438
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,820
他会从头揉到脚的
He's working his way down.

439
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,010
或许只签个缩写就够了
Probably just your initials would be okay.

440
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,160
你猜怎么着
You know what?

441
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,000
你要是不介意的话我想晚点再签
If you don't mind, I'm gonna sign this later,

442
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,110
和卢克一起给你送回家去
send it home with Luke.

443
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,450
行了  走你的吧
All right, come on.

444
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,340
我们完事了
We're done.

445
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,870
好的  不过
Okay, but, uh...

446
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,360
你一定会签字的吧
...you're definitely gonna sign it, right?

447
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,920
一定  我保证  
Definitely, promise.

448
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,750
再见
Bye-bye.

449
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,040
卢克  我们差不多该上楼
Luke, we should probably get upstairs

450
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,540
把床垫翻个面了
and flip that mattress.

451
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,480
卢克  不好意思啊
Luke, I'm sorry.

452
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,450
我忘了你妈
I forgot your mom

453
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,040
喊你回家上钢琴课
needs you home for your piano lesson.

454
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,240
-我们走吧  -我要走了  回见
- Let's go. - Gotta run. See ya.

455
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,350
你反应得也太慢了
Took you long enough.

456
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,000
得了吧  不过慢了10秒钟
Oh, please, it was an extra 10 seconds.

457
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,140
能出什么事
What could have happened?

458
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,300
她一边让我做引体向上
She asked me to do push-ups

459
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,740
一边穿上她的婚纱
while she put on her wedding dress.

460
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,760
她直接跳到婚礼后无力入洞房的戏码了吗
Wow, she jumped right to the Honeymoon Handshake.

461
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,950
这招还有名字啊
It has a name?

462
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,820
你跟你爸从来不聊天吗
Don't you and your dad ever talk?

463
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,320
-我们到处找了斯黛拉  找不到  -目前还没有
- Okay, we've searched everywhere for Stella, no sign. - Yet.

464
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,380
别急  我们会在灰山羊之前找到她的
Don't worry, we'll find her before the gray goat does.

465
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,060
谁
Who?

466
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,660
就是杰  伙伴们长点心
Jay. Come on, guys,

467
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,700
我花了很多时间一直在说那些代号
I spend a lot of time on those code names.

468
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,920
好吧  快一点  因为他要给她拍照
Okay, hurry, because he takes a picture of her

469
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,450
在每一天的同一时刻拍
every day at the same time

470
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,300
因为他要做一个翻书动画
because he's making a flip book.

471
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,160
注意  注意
Ay, watch out, watch out.

472
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,780
我觉得米奇尔在看我们
I think Mitchell is looking at us.

473
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,340
我以为今天早上我已经解除了他的疑心
Okay, I thought I cooled his suspicions this morning.

474
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,490
大笑然后散开
Laugh and disperse.

475
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,450
-妈妈  喝红酒吗  -谢谢
- Hey, mom. Red wine? - Oh, thanks.

476
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,940
-外公说你会喜欢的  -真的吗
- Grandpa said you'd like it. - Really?

477
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,150
谁在乎他怎么想
Well, who cares what he thinks?

478
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,770
他喜欢什么  我就应该也喜欢吗
Just 'cause he likes something, I'm supposed to like it?

479
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,750
不现实
Unreal.

480
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,330
毫无疑问  难喝死了
Mm, and of course, it's gross.

481
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,600
好吧  那我把它拿走
Okay, well, I'll just take it back then.

482
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,420
不  用不着小题大做
No, no! No need to make a big deal out of things.

483
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,740
我就把它喝了吧
I'll just drink it.

484
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,530
你爸联系你了吗
Hey! Any word from your dad?

485
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,320
他大概两小时之前给我发的短信
He texted me, like, two hours ago.

486
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,220
我告诉他你加油的时候车没熄火
I told him how you kept the car running when you got gas

487
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,020
差点把我炸了
and could've blown me up.

488
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,350
你有没有跟他说那些有趣的事呢
But you told him about the fun things too right?

489
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,440
我们吃了那个超大饼干
We had that huge cookie,

490
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,960
你转身而去速度太快把头发甩到我嘴里
you spun away from me fast and got your hair in my mouth.

491
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,830
你拍照干嘛
What was that for?

492
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,780
我朋友贝特西有个图享帐号专门分享可悲的东西
My friend Betsy has an Insta about sad stuff.

493
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,470
-我不是在  -没事  我不会随意评判别人
- Oh, I-I wasn't... - No, it's okay. I don't judge.

494
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,200
我还涂了亮甲油呢
I'm wearing a clear coat on my nails.

495
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,370
我知道  真是个海汤大傻瓜
Yeah, I know, what a chowder head.

496
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,370
{\an8}本意海鲜汤  波士顿名菜

497
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,190
既然说到地方美食
Hey, speaking of that regional delicacy...

498
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,920
我不会投票去波士顿的
I am not voting to go to Boston

499
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,840
就为了去看美国第一个食尸鬼[爱伦·坡]
just so we could see where America's first ghoul

500
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,110
{\an8}他于1809年出生在波士顿
作品中常写到食尸鬼  吸血鬼  鬼魂之类的

501
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,110
是在那里学会如厕的
was potty trained.

502
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,430
介意把你咬掉我的头时
Care to wipe the lipstick off my neck

503
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,760
留下的口红印擦掉吗
from where you bit my head off?

504
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,430
为什么冰箱里没有橙汁
Hey -- And why is there no orange juice?

505
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,960
今天早上我妈才出门买了
My mom went out for some this morning.

506
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
真的吗
Really?

507
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,380
这你就觉得有趣了
That you find interesting?

508
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,240
我干脆现在就收拾准备去白痴海洋公园了吧
Might as well pack for SeaWorld right now.

509
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,520
各位  你们看到艾普丽了吗
Hey, guys, have you seen April?

510
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,810
刚还看到她的
Just saw her a minute ago.

511
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,320
她给我拍照
She had me pose

512
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,550
说要传到她朋友的一个图享帐号
for some Instagram thing her friend does.

513
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,170
你穿的这是什么
What is this?

514
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,530
-从不是大卖场的地方买来的衣服  -等会
- Clothes that don't come from a mall. - Hold on, hold on.

515
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,940
我应该看着你的
I'm supposed to be watching you.

516
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,800
我要去贝特西家
I'm going to Betsy's.

517
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
优步已经在外面等我了
My Uber's out front.

518
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,530
贝特西是谁
Who is this Betsy?

519
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,510
她父母在家吗
Are her parents even home?

520
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,680
你才只有14岁  你不能打优步出门
And you're 14. You're not Ubering anywhere.

521
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,560
还有  你快把妆卸了
Also, you -- you can lose the makeup

522
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,920
你这样看着像个
because you look like a prostitute

523
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,150
电子产品大会上的妓女
at an electronics convention.

524
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,520
立刻脱了它  然后去帮忙摆餐桌
Now, go wipe it off and help set the table.

525
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,030
怎么了  我还不习惯这样管教人  好吗
What? I'm -- I'm not used to being all parenty, okay?

526
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,440
不  你做得很好
No, you did a great job.

527
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,010
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

528
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,140
你刚站在那我觉得怪怪的
I just felt weird 'cause you were standing right there,

529
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,210
因为你才是专家
and you're, like, the expert.

530
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,010
我才不是什么专家
Oh, I am hardly the expert.

531
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:33,990
我还是
I still...

532
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,760
还是有自己的问题要解决
I still have my own stuff to work on.

533
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,110
也许我不该说她像个妓女
Maybe I shouldn't have called her a prostitute?

534
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,520
你应该享受这种快感
You gotta have fun with it. Hm.

535
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,690
爸爸
Hey, dad.

536
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,230
对不起今天我对你说话很凶
I'm sorry that I barked at you today.

537
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,620
都是因为得为博览会下决策时
It's just with this whole Expo decision...

538
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,400
我就像个小女孩需要爸爸的帮助
...I hate feeling like a little girl

539
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
我讨厌这种感觉
that needs her daddy's help.

540
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,700
但我想  向在橱柜界摸爬滚打了
But I guess there's no harm in looking to the guy

541
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,420
25年的男神求助又不会少我一块肉  是吧
who's been knocking it out of the park for 25 years, right?

542
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,320
当然
Nope.

543
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,610
男神能给你的最好的建议就是
And the best advice that guy could give you is,

544
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,700
跟着直觉走
go with you gut...

545
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,090
因为你确实做得很好
'cause you're good at this.

546
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,710
谢谢
Thanks.

547
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,170
谢谢  我已经做了决定了
Thanks. And I -- and I have made a decision.

548
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,140
我会带着马特洪峰去
I'm going with the Matterhorn.

549
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,570
完了
Damn it.

550
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,920
看看我找到了谁
Look who I found!

551
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,510
谢天谢地
Ay, thank God!

552
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,470
我还是头一回这么开心见到她
This is the first time I'm so happy to see her.

553
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,010
赶紧把项圈拿下来  趁他还没...
Let's get this shock collar off before he gets...

554
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,310
伙计们
Hello, guys!

555
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,030
我的乖宝宝在这呢
There's my little baby.

556
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,160
你俩把这些拿进去
You two, take these in the house.

557
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,050
车里还有几袋  来搭把手
I've got a couple left in the trunk. A little help, buddy.

558
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,020
-在大门外面吗  -快来  菲尔
- Oh, on the other side of the gate? - Come on, Phil!

559
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,720
他们不能再绕回来拿吗
Couldn't they just circle back around?

560
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,930
-你说啥  -没啥
- Say what? - It's nothing.

561
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,020
好吧  你拿那袋
All right, take that.

562
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,010
额的亲娘嘞
Oh, mama!

563
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,240
你怎么回事  捡起来呀
What's wrong with you? Pick it up.

564
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,920
就是  捡吧  我这就捡
Yeah, let's do it. Let's pick it up.

565
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,260
你到底抽什么风
What the hell's the matter with you?

566
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,680
-你乱嚎什么呢  -我才没...
- Why are you making those sounds? - I don't think that's...

567
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,660
好吧  放进去之后再出来拿
All right, when you're done here,

568
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,770
这儿还有呢
come back 'cause there's more.

569
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,720
好的
Okie-doke.

570
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,720
这是什么
What the hell is that?

571
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,040
电击项圈吗
Is that a shock collar?

572
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,350
不知道  看我的惊讶[电击]脸就知道
I don't know, but this is a shocked face

573
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,320
我这辈子从没见过这种玩意儿
because I have never seen something like that in my life.

574
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,780
这么说是你买的了
So you obviously bought it.

575
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,210
我只是不想让斯黛拉跑到街上去
I just didn't want Stella to walk out in the street.

576
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,560
所以才要栓狗绳啊
That's what a leash is for!

577
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,530
你是个不称职的狗妈妈
You're a bad dog owner.

578
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,790
坏狗妈妈
Bad dog owner!

579
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,920
那项圈怎么会在你身上
Why did you have it?

580
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,970
我知道为什么
Well, I know why.

581
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,940
因为他们是一伙的
Yeah, because they're all working together.

582
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,940
又来了
Oh, here we go.

583
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,450
你们该听听他今天早上
You should've heard his paranoia this morning

584
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,330
是怎么对那几个俄罗斯租客疑神疑鬼的
about the -- the Russian renters?

585
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,840
多谢提醒  多谢你提起这事
Oh, I'm glad -- I'm glad you brought up the Russians

586
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
看我发现了啥
because look at what I found!

587
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,460
那是我的征服者特别雪茄
That's my El Conquistador Especial.

588
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,920
今早歌洛莉亚从我这拿的
Gloria took that from me this morning.

589
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,980
我猜
Oh, let me guess,

590
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,110
就在她出门买橙汁之前
right before she went out to buy orange juice...

591
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,790
-没错  -其实她并没有买
- That's right. - ...Except for she wasn't.

592
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,170
她和小卡去赶占屋者了
She was with Cam getting rid of the squatters

593
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,920
而我被他拖住了
while I was being stalled by that man!

594
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,370
他们帮我藏麋鹿了
They helped me hide a reindeer!

595
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,420
去年圣诞节的事吗
From a year ago?

596
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,210
鬼知道他们这样已经多久了
Who knows how long this has been going on.

597
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,370
他们私自合伙
Okay, they've been in cahoots,

598
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,850
互相掩护犯下的错事
covering up each other's mistakes

599
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,320
在我们有机会羞辱他们之前就瞒住了
before we've even had a chance to shame them.

600
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,850
你们几个
Since this little alliance

601
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,540
背着我们拉帮结派擅自做决定
made a decision to go behind our backs,

602
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,740
我们也要不带你们  自己做决定一次
maybe we should make a decision without them...

603
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,140
比如度假地点
Oh. ...Like where we're going on vacation.

604
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,680
什么  不行  绝对不行
What? No, por favor, no!

605
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,440
什么  不行  怎么可以这样
What? No! You can't do that.

606
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,000
姐喜欢  姐喜欢
I like it. I like it.

607
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,790
就这么定了  去投票吧
Let's do this. Let's go vote.

608
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,630
好  有了
Yep. We've got it.

609
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,010
好了  我们决定了
Okay. We've reached a decision.

610
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,170
鼓声起
Drum roll please.

611
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,520
凑合吧
Close enough.

612
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,190
