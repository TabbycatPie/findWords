1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,690
What's all this? I said one suitcase.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,810
I need choices, Jay.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,890
Colombia's not one of your more formal nations.

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,120
The guy on their money is sitting in a lawn chair.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,780
Ay. I cannot believe that my little baby's leaving me.

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,940
You know, I left the glass doors open downstairs.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,720
So right now, your actual baby may be leaving you.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,930
One robe.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,280
I guess we know what everyone

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,110
will be talking about my second morning there.

11
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,650
Manny is visiting Gloria's family for about a month, I hope.

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,110
I just gotta get him on a plane before

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,280
Gloria has a meltdown and changes her mind.

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,200
'Cause if he doesn't go to Colombia,

15
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,530
Colombia comes to me.

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,290
It happended before.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,750
Oh, my god.

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,020
- Oh, my god! - What?!

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,660
Oh! It's mitchell. We won.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,500
Ay, that's great! What we won?

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,320
It's fantastic. We've waited so long.

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,300
What did we won?!

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,130
The supreme court ruling. Gay marriage is legal.

24
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,830
Ay! Congratulations!

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,650
Thanks, Gloria.

26
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,050
Can I talk to Cam?

27
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,960
Uh, yes. Hold on.

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,760
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it's Mitchell.

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,320
Hi. Hey.

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,570
I gotta go. But can you believe this finally happened?

31
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,510
I know. It's amazing. We'll celebrate tonight.

32
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,190
- I love you. - Celebrate what?

33
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,850
Oh. Well, Jay, hold on to your hat.

34
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,220
But as of today in California,

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,360
it's legal for a man to marry another man!

36
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,720
Ew. He threw up.

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
He just needs some time to get used to the idea, honey.

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,750
It's so great, Cam.

39
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,480
Yeah, I'm happy for you guys.

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,890
Gloria, Manny needs his birth certificate

41
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,260
to re-enter the country.

42
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,470
Any idea where it is?

43
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,120
I don't know.

44
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,370
Oh, that's right. He leaves today. You must be a wreck.

45
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,470
She's not a wreck. She's a rock.

46
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,220
Now, I looked, and it's not in the safe.

47
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,850
This one had her first sleepover last week.

48
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,910
I just had to tough my way through it.

49
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,960
He picked me up in the dark.

50
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,460
I can't find that birth certificate anywhere, Jay.

51
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,440
Maybe it's a sign and --

52
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,960
It's a sign we need a refresher meeting

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,160
on what goes in the safe.

54
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,220
Here's a preview -- no shoes.

55
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,190
Look, I looked online,

56
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,640
and we can get a copy if we go to the courthouse.

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
That's what we're gonna do. In the car.

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,660
We'll be back in an hour.

59
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,400
Hey, Cam. Congratulations. Go, gay marriage.

60
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,400
He did it again.

61
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,870
Ay, si?

62
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,170

YYeTs.com

68
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,980
So tell me, Cam.

69
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,390
How does it work when it is between two men?

70
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,710
Well, I don't really feel comfortable

71
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,180
talking about that... in front of Lily.

72
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,630
I know how that works.

73
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,790
I rented the wrong movie once.

74
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,100
Did you see "Glen, Garry, Glenn, and Ross"?

75
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,320
Uh, no.

76
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,630
- Why don't you go play? - What I mean is,

77
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,520
who proposes to who?

78
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,130
I don't know. We've talked about it, if it ever became legal.

79
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,920
Okay, and now it is. So are you going to do it today?

80
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,780
Well, it just happened.

81
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,430
I haven't really had...

82
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,320
Oh, you have to do it today.

83
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,600
Every couple deserve a beautiful proposal story.

84
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,230
Well, I have always adored my mom and dad's story.

85
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,270
He plowed "Will you marry me?" into a snowy field

86
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,780
right outside of her window.

87
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,710
And then he tried to re-create it

88
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,180
for their 25th wedding anniversary.

89
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,630
But there was no snow, so he burned it into a cornfield.

90
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,820
Bad idea.

91
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,220
You know, but mama did get a second ring out of it

92
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,450
with the F.E.M.A. money.

93
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,460
Ay, I wish I also had a romantic story.

94
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,160
One day, we were watching tv before dinner,

95
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,130
and Jay says, "Manny, hand me that thing."

96
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,650
And Manny gives him the ring.

97
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,370
I mean, I was very happy, of course,

98
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,170
but it is not the best story.

99
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,150
At least Javier was on top of a dolphin.

100
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,430
Soldiers talk about that moment when they shut off,

101
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,730
when the war finally wins.

102
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,070
- Get down! - Shut up!

103
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,460
I can't see the tv!

104
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,700
Turn the fan on!

105
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,150
Oh, stop yelling! My head's going to explode!

106
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,290
For me, that moment is

107
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,840
four days into summer vacation.

108
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,690
Hey, honey. What's up?

109
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,990
Do you remember when summer meant fireflies

110
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,270
and cutoff shorts and ice-cream trucks?

111
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,060
Well, one out of three.

112
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,830
We'll get our time. They're all going away at some point, right?

113
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,420
Yeah, Haley's got her beach trip,

114
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,400
and Alex is doing Habitat for Humanity,

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,490
and Luke has camp.

116
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,350
If I remember,

117
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,100
I think we have six hours totally kid-free on...

118
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,190
oh, the 14th.

119
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,520
Hey, if we moved Alex's flight,

120
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,040
we could have, like, 10 or 12 hours.

121
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,930
Dream bigger, hot pants.

122
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,510
Step aside.

123
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,020
Sometimes I don't know if I love how much I fear Claire,

124
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,160
or fear how much I love her.

125
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,870
22nd to the 8th for Alex,

126
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,480
Luke to the 14th,

127
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,320
Haley gets a day there.

128
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,100
- Come on. - That's it, beautiful mind.

129
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,950
Harness that crazy into something positive.

130
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,790
Shh! If I can get Alex to move her Habitat for Humanity

131
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,400
from Oklahoma to Sacramento

132
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,310
and Luke to move his camp session,

133
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,120
they will both overlap with Haley's vacation,

134
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,480
and I just bought us seven kid-free days.

135
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,420
- Witchcraft! - Yes.

136
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,120
I've outdone myself, Gloria.

137
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,650
I booked the restaurant from our first date,

138
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,000
the same table overlooking the ocean,

139
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,010
and I'll do it at sunset,

140
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,200
which I've recently discovered is my ideal lighting.

141
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,540
That's so romantic.

142
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,630
I know! Isn't it?

143
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,360
Oh, okay. Oh, that's Mitchell.

144
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,890
Gotta go.

145
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,120
Oh, don't let him hear the excitement in your voice.

146
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,590
You're right. You're right.

147
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,930
- What? - I'm at that coffee shop on 3rd,

148
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,220
and I forgot my wallet.

149
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,090
Can you come bail me out?

150
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,020
Ugh. Isn't this convenient?

151
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,960
It actually was. I was only two blocks away.

152
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,780
But when I got there, I realized it was all a ploy

153
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,390
so he could propose.

154
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,750
But it was so sweet,

155
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,120
I just decided to ditch my plans and let him do it.

156
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,390
Mitchell, I'm so sorry,

157
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,540
But there is a massive pileup on the 405,

158
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,610
and, well, I have to go pick up Lily.

159
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,920
And maybe you could just call Claire or something?

160
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,950
Cam, Cam, I got, like, 50 cents to my name.

161
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,880
Have you decided on a tea?

162
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,060
Do they all cost the same?

163
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,290
Yeah.

164
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,670
Look at that line.

165
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,060
Probably everybody getting their gay marriage license.

166
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,050
I think it's just called a marriage license.

167
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,840
Yeah, I don't know.

168
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,780
Maybe we should go home and forget about it.

169
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,400
What?

170
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,130
I've been reading up on some of those tropical diseases --

171
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,390
Malaria, yellow fever, rabies.

172
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,540
I'm high risk, Jay.

173
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,570
I'm a big hand shaker.

174
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,200
You're fine. You've had all your shots.

175
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,990
And that Paco Rabanne will scare away any mosquitoes.

176
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,520
Jay, I'm scared.

177
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm not sure I want to go through with it.

178
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,190
We didn't drive all the way down here for that piece of paper

179
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,350
for you to get cold feet at the last second.

180
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,570
And what happened, anyway?

181
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,470
You've been looking forward to this day for months.

182
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,180
I know. But maybe we should wait until next year.

183
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,710
I'm still kind of young to be doing this.

184
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,570
We're not waiting.

185
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,230
I already paid for you, and your mother signed off.

186
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
This is happening.

187
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,550
Great day, huh?

188
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,020
- Hello! - Oh, thank god.

189
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,450
I've had so many cups of tea,

190
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,810
they gave me my own one of these.

191
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,480
Ohh. Here you go.

192
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,480
So congratulations on the whole marriage thing.

193
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,190
- How amazing is that, right? - Yeah.

194
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,160
We gonna hear some big gay wedding bells soon?

195
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,480
Ah, well, just wedding bells.

196
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,610
Yeah. Yeah, of course. We've always talked about it.

197
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,130
But, you know,

198
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,250
it's just -- just a matter of finding the right timing.

199
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,970
And then there -- there's a couple of other factors --

200
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,730
the tax implications and estate planning.

201
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,010
Oh, stop. I'm swooning.

202
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,890
I'm just being practical.

203
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,090
You're the same way.

204
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,770
You -- you told Phil to take back your engagement ring

205
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,210
and buy you a washer/dryer.

206
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,210
Well, don't put this back on me. Come on.

207
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,150
What is Cam's biggest complaint about you?

208
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,580
You're not romantic.

209
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,830
This is your opportunity.

210
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,930
Mitchell, you should go home tonight

211
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,190
and surprise him with a big, splashy proposal.

212
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,860
He would really like it if I proposed to him.

213
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,350
I guess I could stop after work and pick up a card.

214
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,620
- And... - Oh, my god. You're hopeless.

215
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,360
- I know. - Mitchell, okay.

216
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,090
- This is what you do. - Oh, boy.

217
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,200
It really should be your own idea, though.

218
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,360
No! Come on, come on. I need help. Please?

219
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,500
Fine. Okay.

220
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,840
Tonight, you cook him his favorite meal.

221
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,630
You open the best bottle of wine.

222
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,580
And just as the two of you are sitting down to enjoy it,

223
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,870
you break up with him.

224
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,800
What? Why?

225
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,640
Because then, as he is at his lowest,

226
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,600
you pop the question.

227
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,620
He goes from agony to ecstasy!

228
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,220
It's so romantic.

229
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,490
You're kidding, right?

230
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,390
More traditional? Okay.

231
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,730
All right. You look into his eyes...

232
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,310
And you say, "I saw a doctor.

233
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,240
He found a small dark mass."

234
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,310
What are you?

235
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,940
And then just as he begins to cry,

236
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,670
you pull out a black box with a ring in it.

237
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,030
There's your small dark mass!

238
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,200
It's genius!

239
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
Y-you're a disaster.

240
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,830
You could go the disaster route, too.

241
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,980
Did you ever hear how I told Phil we were gonna have Luke?

242
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,980
I said, "Thousands of children die every day..."

243
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,200
Dad?

244
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,260
I'm sorry. Was I being proud of you too loud?

245
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,940
What are you doing?

246
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,650
Going off to habitat, helping all those people.

247
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,920
Honey, I'm speechless.

248
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
Thanks. I just thought it was --

249
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,840
But are we sure about Oklahoma?

250
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,920
There's so many needy people right up in Sacramento.

251
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
And it's driving distance.

252
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,100
I already signed up for my work detail,

253
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,780
and I've been e-mailing with my tentmate.

254
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,400
Yeah. No, you're right.

255
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,710
I guess it's just...

256
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,390
No.

257
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,740
Never mind.

258
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,230
What is it?

259
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,210
No, it's stupid.

260
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,350
I've just never been so far away

261
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,800
from my baby girl before.

262
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,640
Not now, waterworks. Not now.

263
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,640
Oh, daddy.

264
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,610
You okay, dad?

265
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,660
Oh, hey, buddy. Never been better.

266
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,730
You're so thoughtful.

267
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,790
I'm gonna miss that when you go off to camp on the 14th.

268
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,590
Little Wiffle golf?

269
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,040
Wait. I cant't go to camp on the 14th.

270
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,490
I have to go when Carly's going.

271
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,970
Who's Carly?

272
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,740
She's this girl I like, and she's here right now.

273
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,850
Well, all the more reason to change camp sessions.

274
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,400
Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It's foolproof.

275
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,300
Not this fool. Forget it.

276
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,330
What about all the new girls you're gonna meet?

277
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,590
You're only 14.

278
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,190
Do you really want to be tied down?

279
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,090
Yes!

280
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,790
Oh, Luke, watch. I-I got it. Okay.

281
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,870
Okay.

282
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,850
Nice!

283
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,820
Oh, hi, Mr. Dunphy.

284
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,340
Sorry we moved the furniture around.

285
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,230
I was showing Luke

286
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,880
the flip I did at tumbling sectionals.

287
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,880
Oh, no. That's my mom.

288
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,150
But I can leave you guys this old movie I brought over.

289
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,550
It's called "Dirty Dancing."

290
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,160
Never let her go.

291
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,430
Hey, Carly's mom. Phil Dunphy.

292
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,500
Big fan of your daughter.

293
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,400
- Thank you. - Get off me!

294
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,270
So, yeah, heads up. Luke's got to change his camp session.

295
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,270
- You guys may want to do the same. - No.

296
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,740
My husband and I have been working the white board all week,

297
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,900
and we just bought three days away from that.

298
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,520
- It wasn't even me! - Bank it!

299
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,180
Carly!

300
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,040
Okay, Manny, remember, as soon as you land,

301
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,290
watch out for Malaria.

302
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,960
Why? I got a shot for that.

303
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,000
Can we hurry this up?

304
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,180
No, I'm talking about your cousin Malaria.

305
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,250
She's coming to pick you up, but she might have Rubella.

306
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,420
- What? - That's her daughter.

307
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,470
But make room in the car

308
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,640
because she could have diphtheria.

309
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,450
Who's diphtheria?

310
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,400
Ay, Manny, diphtheria is a disease.

311
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,610
That's why I want you to be apart from her in the car.

312
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,490
Okay, let's go. Gloria, better say goodbye here.

313
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,910
He's got to hurry to get through security.

314
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,600
- But there's no line. - For now.

315
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,640
A senior tour bus just pulled up.

316
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,380
You know how much private wanding that is?

317
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,130
Half their skeletons are metal.

318
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,340
Ay, Manny, please. Call me as soon as you land.

319
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,700
- I'll miss you. - And we're walking.

320
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,860
I love you!

321
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,770
- Wait. - No. Up!

322
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,030
I forgot to give mom this card I wrote.

323
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,380
Uh, no, no, no. I'll handle it.

324
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,320
Safe trip, buddy. Safe trip.

325
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,920
We're out of here.

326
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,100
No, let's wait until he gets to the top.

327
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,940
Adios, mi amor!

328
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,380
Who wants ice cream? Huh?

329
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,940
What if he never comes back?

330
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,890
Oh, honey, no one ever leaves home and doesn't come back.

331
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,990
I did.

332
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,960
Hey, honey.

333
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,460
I've been mulling over your Sacramento decision.

334
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,270
It wasn't exactly my --

335
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,070
Of course I want my baby girl close,

336
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,880
but I got to get used to you leaving.

337
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,920
Because college -- and knowing you, a great college --

338
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,120
is right around the corner.

339
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,210
Am I right?

340
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,190
Now, habitat will look good on an application,

341
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,430
but does Sacramento really move the needle?

342
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,480
I have another place in mind.

343
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,940
Little hint -- it starts with an "El."

344
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,170
El Salvador? Are you serious?

345
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,810
They have an unstable government

346
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,380
and -- and earthquakes.

347
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,630
Boats. Looks like there's a h-hill.

348
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,920
I'm just saying, you don't push yourself at this stage,

349
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,690
you wind up at a second-tier college.

350
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,520
Soon you've lost all your ambition.

351
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,070
You're just drifting through life,

352
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,580
hoping someone offers you an "M-r-s" Degree.

353
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,090
Is that who you want to be?

354
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,960
Hey, princess. Second breakfast?

355
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,860
Fun.

356
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,600
So, big beach trip coming up, huh?

357
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,360
Yeah.

358
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,120
Can't get better than late July,

359
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,350
- unless it's early Aug... - Save it, dad.

360
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,060
I know you and mom want the house to yourselves.

361
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,580
Nope.

362
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,720
I'm the last piece of the puzzle, right?

363
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,950
What's it worth to you?

364
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,030
Fine.

365
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,650
How about I pay for gas and two dinners?

366
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,400
Mnh-mnh. Gas,

367
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,830
All dinners, groceries, two new bathing suits,

368
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,360
- a boogie board, one of those... - Are you crazy?

369
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,430
- No. I'm also not done. - Yes, you are done.

370
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,240
You know why?

371
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,330
You know another way this shakes out?

372
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,120
You don't go.

373
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,830
That's right. Overplay your hand, I pull the plug,

374
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,940
you blow your last chance for a good time with your friends.

375
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,380
Word gets out that you're not cool.

376
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,490
Then school starts.

377
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,320
You end up with your nose in a book all year.

378
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,500
No friends, no dates,

379
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,760
not caring how you look.

380
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,620
Is that who you want to be?

381
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,130
Turns out Mitchell really had forgotten his wallet,

382
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,500
so proposing wasn't even on his radar.

383
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,400
My plan was bulletproof.

384
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,930
He was gonna be as blindsided

385
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,870
as the fattest hog on Founder's Day,

386
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,670
And I was...

387
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,720
Pretty darn proud of myself.

388
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,050
I had the ideal proposal.

389
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,740
Cam once told me that all he wanted

390
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,890
was someone to sit in a rocking chair and grow old with.

391
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,330
So while we're at dinner,

392
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,090
Claire is setting up two rocking chairs

393
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,660
next to the fireplace, with a bottle of champagne.

394
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,990
Ohh. He is going to...

395
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,160
Squeal like a Berkshire white

396
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,460
in a four-man pig toss.

397
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,600
Gosh durn it, I miss Founder's Day.

398
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,230
This is a little bit fancy for just a quick bite.

399
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,600
Well, who knows if they can even get us in?

400
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,570
Let me check.

401
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,500
Reservation for Tucker.

402
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,130
Is everything set up with the table?

403
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,090
Yeah.

404
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,920
The restaurant where we had our first date,

405
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,620
the sunset lighting that Cam loves...

406
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,420
He was going to propose.

407
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,450
I-I-I was so touched,

408
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,520
but at the same time, he was ruining the one chance I had

409
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,800
for romantic redemption.

410
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,300
Oh, I'm feeling really queasy, Cam.

411
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,080
No, no, no. You'll be okay once we sit down.

412
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,590
I think I need to go home. Sorry.

413
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,990
Oh! S-- excuse me. Sorry.

414
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,020
No, no, no. We'll get you some ginger ale, some crackers.

415
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,350
Mnh-mnh. I'm -- I got to run to the restroom.

416
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,550
You -- you grab the car.

417
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,840
Well, you'll feel better after you throw up.

418
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,570
Okay, new plan. We're coming back early.

419
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,450
Is everything set up?

420
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,300
You said two hours. We haven't even left yet.

421
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,180
- Well, hurry! - Just stall.

422
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,670
Tell him that... Haley had a hemorrhage,

423
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,330
and you're her blood type,

424
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,730
- so you... - I'm not doing that, you ghoul.

425
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,510
Just get back to the house and --

426
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,340
- Gloria. - Cam, how did it go?

427
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,620
- Did he... - It didn't happen.

428
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,780
I have to go with the backup plan.

429
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,100
Fortunately, I had an alternate proposal scenario

430
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,670
in case there was a problem.

431
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,300
Jay and Gloria were babysitting,

432
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,650
so I asked them to re-create

433
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,100
the picnic under the stars we had

434
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,130
the night we moved in to our first apartment.

435
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,150
Mitchell would take one look and...

436
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,500
Sob like a Tony winner.

437
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,680
I got the picnic basket.

438
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,550
But you know what is going to be hard to find?

439
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,990
My interest in this whole damn thing?

440
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,240
No, the blue-and-white tablecloth.

441
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,740
Here it is. It was in the occasions closet.

442
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,550
They keep their tools in a pillowcase,

443
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,600
but they have an occasions closet?

444
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,760
What are you guys doing here?

445
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,870
Oh. Cam is going to propose to Mitch,

446
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,890
so we're here to help him set it up.

447
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,390
That is coconuts!

448
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,000
Mitchell asked us to do the same thing for him.

449
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,420
Well, that just makes me want to stay

450
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,840
and see how this whole thing works out.

451
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,700
Oh, we can. Let's set it up and then we'll hide somewhere.

452
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,160
Ay, yes, in the occasion closet.

453
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,950
No. We do what they asked and leave.

454
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,360
We never had these problems.

455
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,010
This is what happens when they let men marry men.

456
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,890
That cannot be a coincidence.

457
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,370
Sorry about the detour.

458
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,710
I was just worried about the pileup on the 405.

459
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,880
Oh, take your time. The drive's actually soothing me.

460
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,240
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

461
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Oh! What -- what was that?

462
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,440
Oh. I think it's a blown tire. It's okay.

463
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,330
Well, I know there's a spare. Do -- do we have the tools?

464
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,850
- Yeah, yeah. They're in the pillowcase in the trunk. - Right.

465
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,390
Why do you have to be so grouchy?

466
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,540
We're giving them a beautiful story.

467
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,440
Everybody deserves one.

468
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,940
I'm an idiot.

469
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,270
Oh, you're not an idiot. You're not as romantic as some --

470
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,220
These things peel off on the back,

471
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,510
and I've been gluing 'em.

472
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,590
Why do I even bother? You don't care about this stuff.

473
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,940
What's that supposed to mean?

474
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,380
Yeah, like when you proposed to me.

475
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,250
"Hey, Manny, hand me that thing."

476
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,220
That's my whole story.

477
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,730
Hang on. That wasn't my fault.

478
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,090
I had something big planned.

479
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,640
You asked him for the ring.

480
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,110
I was asking for the remote. He jumped the gun.

481
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,590
He was supposed to give me the ring

482
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,440
later that night at the restaurant.

483
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,660
The waiter was gonna come by and offer coffee.

484
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,790
I was gonna say, "No, thank you. It'll keep me up,

485
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,600
and lately, I've been loving my dreams,

486
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,340
and there's one in particular I hope comes true."

487
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,770
Manny gives me the ring.

488
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,840
I say, "Gloria --"

489
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,180
Yes, Jay! Yes, I marry you!

490
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,140
I love my new story.

491
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,060
Little heads-up -- there's no way I'm not crying at this wedding.

492
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,630
Phil, you cried on the way here.

493
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,600
I was on the brink already.

494
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,050
I watched "Dirty Dancing" before we left.

495
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,200
Text from my dad.

496
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,270
Oh, no.

497
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,790
He wants me to come visit him for a couple of days,

498
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,650
but it's right in the middle of our kid-free week.

499
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,620
Oh, that's too bad. I guess you could take two days.

500
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,790
I may have mentioned to Frank

501
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,180
that Phil might be available that week.

502
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,130
The only thing better than a kid-free week

503
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,280
is a couple of days carved out just for mama.

504
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,950
Perfect.

505
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,820
Yeah.

506
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,140
Hey, you remember the day I proposed to you?

507
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,290
Of course I do.

508
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,130
I don't remember the exact date, but, yes.

509
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,300
March 19, 1994.

510
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,550
Oh. Yeah.

511
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,700
I was in such a bad mood that afternoon.

512
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,000
I was on day two of a St. Patrick's hangover.

513
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,640
I don't remember that.

514
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,580
I just remember how crazy in love I was.

515
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,710
I couldn't wait to ask you.

516
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,110
I even ran a red light on the way to pick you up.

517
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,910
I still have the ticket.

518
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,590
No, you don't. Why would you say something like that?

519
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,900
Are you kidding me? I was racing to my life.

520
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,570
It's in a box at my dad's

521
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,140
with a bunch of other stuff --

522
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,150
The program from that concert where I met you...

523
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,970
...the matchbook with the fake number on it you gave me...

524
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,080
The souvenir goblet from our first date.

525
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,740
You really think I'd throw away all those beautiful memories...

526
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,790
...milady?

527
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,040
I haven't seen that stuff for a long time.

528
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,630
I got to dig it out when I see my dad.

529
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,580
Okay, stop. Sorry.

530
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,320
What?

531
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,600
I told your dad to call you

532
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,600
because I wanted some time for myself.

533
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,250
Yeah, couple of days away from my perfect, romantic husband,

534
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,280
who is far too good

535
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,060
for this cold-hearted, bloodless wife-bot.

536
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,700
You have blood.

537
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,230
Honey, I just put the chairs in front of the fireplace.

538
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,740
You made it romantic.

539
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,990
Mitchell's right. I'm a ghoul.

540
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,090
Come here.

541
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,870
You're romantic, too, in your own funny way.

542
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,690
We're just different.

543
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,210
So what if I'm more sentimental?

544
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,070
My mom.

545
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,270
I mean, sure...

546
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,980
Marriage needs romance.

547
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,410
You know what it also needs?

548
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,110
"Spoke to Phil, and he suggested --"

549
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,540
Forgiveness.

550
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,310
Okay. Spare, please.

551
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,690
Yes, doctor.

552
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,920
I can't believe this has happened to us so many times,

553
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,050
we actually have a system.

554
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,850
Oh, I know. You've come a long way

555
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,550
from the first time you ever saw a jack.

556
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,540
Remember, you couldn't believe...

557
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,520
I'm sorry. This is amazing.

558
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,310
I am lifting a car right now.

559
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,140
I am the strongest man in the world.

560
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,560
Oh, do you remember that time in Yosemite

561
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,280
when it was snowing so bad?

562
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,950
Yeah. What was that, like six years ago?

563
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,180
Oh, gosh. No, it was before Lily,

564
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,540
so it was at least seven or eight.

565
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,430
God, it is -- it's going by so fast.

566
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,450
Yeah. You're telling me.

567
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,030
You know, it's a different world down there

568
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,830
than it was 24 hours ago.

569
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,330
Cam, tire. Tire!

570
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,360
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my -- oh, my god.

571
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,330
Oh, my god!

572
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,680
It's gonna be a different world

573
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,380
for the people in that yellow house.

574
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,900
This is not at all how I saw the evening going.

575
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,330
Honey, you have no idea.

576
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,910
Do you remember our first apartment?

577
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,400
Yes. What -- what made you think of that?

578
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,850
I don't know.

579
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,040
The stars.

580
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,160
All right. Come on. Let's do this.

581
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,070
Yeah.

582
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,480
- Yes. - Yes.

583
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,780
Hey, there, you with the stars on your thighs.

584
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,590
- Huh? - It's an old song. I thought I would...

585
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,690
Eh, why do I bother?

586
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,360
- What is this? - Oh. Oh, that's from Manny.

587
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,110
I was hoping to wait and give it to you in a couple of days.

588
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,370
But, uh, just remember that he's fine.

589
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,650
He's only a plane ride away.

590
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,990
Nice.

591
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,530
I'm going to wash my face.

592
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,540
Okay.

593
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,890
I hope that my cousins don't take him riding the horses

594
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,620
or shooting the guns.

595
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,890
I know that he's almost a man, but...

596
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,770
Jay?

597
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,690
"Make sure you take care of Jay.

598
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,880
Please call me after his checkup on Thursday.

599
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,590
I'll miss you guys so much."

600
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,740
Nice, huh?

601
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,890
Nice?

602
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,850
I'm gonna mail him his other robe.
