00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,450
是弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
Isn't it a fact that it was Francis Underwood

和田納西州傳出的令人不安的消息
and the disturbing news coming out of Tennessee...

49
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,560
讓我不得不關閉幾個我們的投票站

53
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,640
怎么  你以為我沒從戈爾那里學到教訓嗎
What? You think I learned nothing from Al Gore?

54
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,640
-不是我的總統  -不是我的總統
- Not my president! - Not my president!

55
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,530
-不是我的總統  -不是我的總統
- Not my president! - Not my president!

56
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,640
-不是我的總統  -不是我的總統
- Not my president! - Not my president!

57
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,610
-不是我的總統  -不是我的總統
- Not my president! - Not my president!

58
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,680
-不是我的總統  -不是我的總統
- Not my president! - Not my president!

59
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,820
人民很憤怒
The people are angry.

60
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,580
九周前  我們國家舉行了一場大選
Nine weeks ago, we had an election in this country,

61
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,600
但是由于兩個州拒絕認證選舉結果
but because two states refused to certify,

62
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,700
康威和我都沒拿到270張選舉人票
neither Conway nor myself received the 270 electoral votes

63
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,460
而這是勝選的必要條件
required for victory.

64
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,710
所以他們每天早上聚集在這里
So they gather here every morning

65
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,410
來履行他們神圣的權利
to exercise their magnificent right,

66
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,920
被第一修正案保障的權利
guaranteed by the First Amendment...

67
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,290
發出他們憤怒的聲音
to let their angry voices be heard.

68
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,900
就這樣  感恩節  圣誕節
And so, Thanksgiving, Christmas,

69
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,210
再加上半個一月來了又去
and half of January have come and gone,

70
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,290
政府的三大分支全都深陷危機
and all three branches of government are in crisis.

71
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,230
國會吵成一團
The Congress is in disarray,

72
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,080
最高法院少了一位法官  必將陷入僵局
the Supreme Court is down a justice and doomed to deadlock,

73
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,430
而行政機關也群龍無首
and the executive branch is without a boss.

74
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,540
你看  我覺得
You see, my feeling is,

75
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,480
國父們就是乏了
I think the Founding Fathers, they just got tired.

76
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,900
說真的  誰能怪他們呢
And really, can you blame them?

77
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,820
你怎么可能把方方面面都考慮周全
I mean, you can't think of everything.

78
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,790
各種意外  各種難以避免的災難
Black swans, Murphy's Law.

79
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,470
到了一定程度
I mean, at a certain point,

80
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,600
你也只能放棄  交叉手指
you just have to sign off and cross your goddamn fingers

81
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,210
祈求能有個好結果
and hope for the best.

82
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,000
或者使用"扔硬幣原理"
Or adopt "flipism,"

83
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,660
這是一種偽哲學  意思是
a pseudo-philosophy of life in which

84
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,830
生活中最重要的事都要通過扔硬幣來決定
the most important decisions are made by the flipping of a coin.

85
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,380
這個說法最先出現在迪士尼的漫畫書
It was first introduced in the Disney comic book

86
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,450
《硬幣決定法》里  我最喜歡這期了
Flip Decision, one of my favorites,

87
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,680
里面講到巴蒂教授說服唐老鴨
in which Donald Duck is persuaded by Professor Batty

88
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,730
所有重大的人生決定
to make all the most important decisions

89
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,680
都通過扔硬幣來決斷
based on the flipping of a coin.

90
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,610
"生活就是場賭博
"Life is but a gamble.

91
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,500
讓扔硬幣原理指引你"
Let flipism guide your ramble."

92
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,320
我們以前也有過這種麻煩
We've had this sort of trouble before.

93
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,810
1800年大選  杰斐遜對伯爾
The election of 1800, Jefferson versus Burr.

94
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,710
他們最后打成了平手  每人73張選舉人票
They wound up in a tie. 73 electoral votes each.

95
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,130
那是當時的勝選票數
That was the number required then,

96
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,590
這時國會試圖解決這種
and that's when Congress tried to address

97
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,510
國父們根本想象不到的局面
what the Founding Fathers just couldn't imagine.

98
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,980
于是  第十二修正案誕生了
And, poof, the Twelfth Amendment was born.

99
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,020
里面說  如果各州不能認證選舉結果
And it says that if the states don't certify,

100
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,300
那么就由眾議院來挑選總統
it's the House that chooses the president

101
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,410
由參議院來選副總統
and the Senate that chooses the vice president.

102
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,750
眾議院有點亂  說不清楚
Now the House is a bit of a mess,

103
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,740
但是參議院選副總統的辦法可是挺民主的
but the Senate is rather democratic in how they choose the VP.

104
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,620
一人一票
One person, one vote.

105
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,290
但如果還是平局
But if there's a tie...

106
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,590
就該唐老鴨登場了
and this is where Donald Duck comes in,

107
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,120
選舉的結果
it's resolved...

108
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,560
全看這硬幣一扔
by the toss of a coin.

109
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,570
這辦法簡潔得見了鬼
A solution that's elegant as hell.

110
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,550
不過現代政治哪有什么簡潔可言
But then there's no elegance in modern politics.

111
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,170
只剩下見鬼了
It's mostly hell.

112
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,220
美國總統的寶座花落誰家
The identity of the next President of these United States

113
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,580
決定權再次落到了這一幫
is once again in the hands of a bunch of

114
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,620
自私自利  嗜財如命
self-serving, money-hungry,

115
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,280
阿諛諂媚  貪戀權勢的政治家手里
boot-licking, power-seeking politicians

116
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,750
而加以利誘  或者迎頭痛擊
who can be seduced or sucker punched

117
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,810
或者要挾就能讓他們服從
or blackmailed into submission.

118
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,180
我只需要比另一個人多一票就行
And all I need is just one more vote than the other guy.

119
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,140
如你所見  國父們根本沒想到會有這種局面
As you can see, the Founding Fathers didn't plan for this.

120
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,030
而我想到了
But I did.

121
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,180
我就是你的新爹
Meet your new daddy.

122
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,460
好
Right.

123
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,940
你能感覺到  對吧  簡直身臨其境
You can feel it, right? It's like you're there.

124
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,300
是不是跟真的一樣
Doesn't that look just like it?

125
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,980
在我看來簡直就是那個地方
To me, it is that place.

126
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
你還好吧
You okay, man?

127
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,350
好  當然好了
Yeah. Of course.

128
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,170
真的有幫助  很管用的
It really helps. Very effective.

129
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,330
是啊  我很樂意幫你拉更多投資來
Yeah. I'd be happy to help you find more funding for it.

130
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,740
如果你情緒有點激動的話
If you're feeling a little worked up...

131
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,880
什么
What?

132
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,980
情緒激動
Little worked up?

133
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,050
兩個多月以前我就當選成為美國總統了
I was elected President of the United States over two months ago.

134
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,680
但不知為何  現在國會將決定選舉結果
But somehow, Congress is now deciding the election.

135
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
所以原諒我有些
So forgive me for being a little...

136
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,800
-威爾  -情緒激動
- Will... - ...worked up.

137
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,180
東尼應該不是話中有話
I don't think Tony was implying anything.

138
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,910
當然  那好
Of course. Good.

139
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,490
我去準備一下
I'm gonna get myself ready.

140
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,710
我可不想這副樣子去參加活動
I don't want to go to the event looking like this.

141
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,810
是啊
Right.

142
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,880
謝謝  東尼
Thanks, Tony.

143
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,830
羅梅洛的幕僚長堅稱他不在這兒
Romero's chief of staff insists he's not in town.

144
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,650
-你相信她嗎  -不
- And do you believe her? - No.

145
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,910
但她在特區待得比他久
But she's been in D.C. longer than he has.

146
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,620
她總會顧及自己的
At some point she'll take care of herself.

147
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,430
你告沒告訴她  我不想跟他談
Well, did you tell her I have no interest in discussing

148
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,610
宣戰委員會的事
the Declaration of War Committee with him?

149
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
我表明了
I expressed our desire

150
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,010
我們想跟議員進行一次客氣而有成效的談話
for a civil and productive meeting with the Congressman.

151
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,690
找到他
Well, find him.

152
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,600
要是他想躲著我
If he wants to hide from me,

153
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,980
那就當著我的面做
he can do it to my face.

154
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,930
是  先生
Yes, sir.

155
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,750
還有  道格
And, Doug.

156
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,320
今天外面有多少抗議者
How many protestors are out there today?

157
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,230
比昨天多
More than yesterday.

158
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,220
但他們已經盡力
But they're doing their best

159
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,120
讓他們遠離白宮了
to divert them away from the White House.

160
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,170
我不知道哪樣更糟
I don't know what's worse...

161
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,220
是他們抗議喊口號的聲音
the sound of their chanting

162
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,130
還是他們不喊時的寂靜
or the sound of silence when they're not.

163
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,250
我去工作了  先生
I'll get to work, sir.

164
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,910
早上好  奧古斯都
Good morning, Augustus.

165
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,900
艾瑞克  我...
Well, Eric, I...

166
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,940
抱歉  他們讓我坐著  但
I'm sorry. They told me to sit, but, uh--

167
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,330
沒事  完全沒關系  我
No, no, no. It's perfectly fine. I...

168
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,830
我想不到還有誰
I can't imagine anyone else who would...

169
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,490
會比你更喜歡這個
well, enjoy this more than you.

170
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,270
我們在斯波特瑟爾韋尼亞相遇后
You know, I only started it

171
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,880
我才開始做的這個
after you and I met in Spotsylvania.

172
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,210
你對細節的注重簡直是
The attention to detail is... It's just...

173
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,810
沒錯
It is, yes.

174
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,730
我有
I've got...

175
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,850
我
I mean, I...

176
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,690
抱歉  我現在有點不知所錯
I'm sorry, I'm a... a little overwhelmed by the moment.

177
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,460
就是
It's just...

178
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,740
我有一種感覺  就好像
I have this feeling, as if, uh...

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,080
我曾經想象過這個場景
I've imagined this somehow.

180
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,430
我知道這聽起來
I know that sounds, uh...

181
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,090
你連他背包上的扣子都做出來了
You've even got the button on his haversack.

182
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,350
是啊
Yes.

183
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,630
我覺得人們會低估
I think people underestimate...

184
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,380
注重細節
the importance of detail...

185
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,170
對整體感覺的影響
to the overall impact.

186
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,280
是啊
Yeah.

187
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,720
血腥角專家肯定會非常欽佩的
The Bloody Angle experts would be very impressed.

188
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,820
我們在斯波特瑟爾韋尼亞相遇時  你怎么知道
When we met in Spotsylvania, how did you know...

189
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,280
那么多關于奧古斯都的細節
so many specific things about Augustus, uh...

190
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,190
關于奧古斯都·安德伍德之死
about Augustus Underwood's death?

191
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,000
知道他犧牲的確切地點
I mean, the very spot where he died?

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,960
知道他的腦袋被石頭砸扁了
The... the fact that his skull had been crushed with a rock?

193
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,440
知道他們把他葬在無名冢里
That they buried him in an unmarked grave? I mean...

194
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,430
這么多細節
the detail of all that.

195
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,710
希望你能原諒我
Hope you'll forgive me, uh...

196
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,420
原諒什么
For?

197
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,850
我那天見到了副總統弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
I was meeting Vice President Francis Underwood.

198
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,360
我覺得應該給他講個精彩的傳說
I... thought he deserved a good story.

199
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,770
慢著  等等
Wait, wait a minute. You...

200
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,530
-那些全是你編的  -那個
- you made all that up? - Well...

201
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,570
我自由發揮了一下
I took some liberties.

202
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,740
但  我也說不好  我一開了頭
But, well, I don't know, once it started,

203
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,720
就能清晰地看見了
it came to me so clearly...

204
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,620
-艾瑞克  對嗎  -對  先生
- It's Eric, yeah? - Yes, sir.

205
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,770
抗議人群嗎
The crowd?

206
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,980
對  抱歉  你剛才要說什么
Yes. I'm sorry, what were you about to say?

207
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,630
我無意唐突  先生
I don't mean to overstep, sir...

208
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,900
但外面的人
but the people out there...

209
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,550
我不在乎他們說什么
I don't care what they're saying.

210
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,130
在我看來  人的命運
And the way I see it, a person's destiny is, you know...

211
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,960
是注定的
sealed.

212
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,130
我們踏入了未知領域
We are in uncharted territory here.

213
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,680
好  但是唐尼  幫個忙好嗎
All right. But, Donny, do me a favor, okay?

214
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,310
-讓憲法  -我能說完嗎
- Let the Constitution-- - Can I finish?

215
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,490
等等  讓憲法行使它的職責
Hold on. Just let the Constitution do its job.

216
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,390
好吧  喬  讓我說完一次
Okay, Joe, Joe, I'm gonna finish for once.

217
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,070
現在有選民提起個訴
You've got voters filing individual suits...

218
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,190
-對  -田納西和俄亥俄都有
- Right. - ...in Tennessee and Ohio,

219
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,650
都堆在最高法院了
and they are jammed up in the Supreme Court.

220
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,900
就像別的一切
Like everything else,

221
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,630
這個國家的日常事務被中斷了
the day-to-day workings of this country are on hold.

222
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,180
好  或許是被中斷了  但你猜怎么
Okay, they may be on hold, but guess what?

223
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,430
據我所知
Last time I checked,

224
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,950
大家仍然在領社保支票
everybody was still getting their Social Security checks.

225
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,330
沒錯  但如果達到債務上限了呢
Yeah, but if the debt limit is reached?

226
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,210
拜托  讓我說完
Come on. Let me finish now.

227
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,570
再說一遍  這就是為什么我們有憲法
Again, it's why we have a Constitution.

228
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,310
我知道看上去很混亂
I know it looks messy.

229
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,200
民主就很混亂  但你猜怎么
Democracy's messy. But guess what?

230
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,230
這種亂局是有規律的
There is a method to that madness.

231
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,820
我說不好  喬
I don't know, Joe.

232
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,750
如今是混亂勝過規律
It's more madness than method right now.

233
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,040
如果政府停擺
I mean, if the government does shut down,

234
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,240
那些社保支票或許就要停發
those Social Security checks, they might not go out.

235
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,370
如果政府停擺
If the government shuts down,

236
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,950
誰知道國會還能不能選出總統
who knows if Congress can even pick a president?

237
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,190
眾議院的每個州只有一票
Each state in the House just gets one vote.

238
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,090
那么如果特拉華州和羅德島州這樣的小州
So if smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island

239
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,580
不能達成共識
can't reach a consensus...

240
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,420
-嗯  -不  是這樣的
- Right. - No, it's true.

241
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,190
如果一兩個
I mean, if one or two of these

242
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,190
非常固執的國會成員
really stubborn members of Congress

243
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,690
決定頑固抵抗  可能要耗數月
decides they're going to hold this up, it could be months.

244
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,360
我正是這個意思
Look, that's what I'm saying.

245
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,880
得到26張選票并不容易
The road to 26 votes is not an easy one.

246
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,880
好吧  時局確實奇怪  米卡
All right. Strange days indeed, Mika.

247
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,650
這些是短篇小說的開頭嗎
So are these the start to short stories?

248
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,060
現在還不是什么  只是片段
They're nothing yet. Fragments.

249
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,130
碎片
Pieces.

250
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,340
顯然這是關于我的
I mean, clearly, this is about me.

251
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,790
這是我母親
This is my mother.

252
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,440
這是我們
And this is us.

253
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,610
-你不能寫  -我要寫
- You can't write-- - I'm writing.

254
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,700
這是我的工作  我是個作家
It's what I do. I'm a writer.

255
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,330
我知道你很不滿  湯姆  但是
I know you're frustrated, Tom, but--

256
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:11,910
不是不滿
I wouldn't say frustrated.

257
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,470
這是侵犯
Well, it's invasive.

258
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,680
-寫你自己的經歷  -這是我的經歷
- Write about your own experiences. - This is my experience.

259
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,190
聽著  湯姆
Listen, Tom,

260
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,330
我們決定弗蘭西斯和我要留在這里
just because we've decided Francis and I need to stay here,

261
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,550
不代表你也是
doesn't mean you have to.

262
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,770
如果你有事
So if you have things you need to do,

263
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,220
就應該去做
you should go ahead and do them.

264
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,770
我這一天得說服參議院給我投票
I'll be spending my day convincing the Senate to vote for me,

265
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,870
不需要演講
so there's no speeches necessary.

266
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,020
好
Yeah, okay.

267
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,460
你知道嗎  我確實有事情要做
You know what? I do have some things to do.

268
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,890
我需要去找一些人  所以
Some people I need to check in with. So...

269
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:39,790
湯姆
Tom.

270
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,550
怎么了
Yeah?

271
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,060
什么事
Yes?

272
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,240
準備好了嗎  安德伍德夫人
You ready, Mrs. Underwood?

273
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,310
我會安排一輛車等你
I'll have a car waiting for you.

274
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,350
你想先聽好消息還是壞消息
So do you want the good news or the bad news first?

275
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,820
永遠先聽壞消息
Always the bad.

276
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,640
總統的支持率已跌至19%
The president's approvals are down to 19%.

277
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,400
好消息
And the good?

278
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,660
國會情況更糟
They're worse for Congress.

279
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,590
而你是30%
And you're at 30.

280
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,640
幸好我們現在要說服的是國會
Well, thankfully it's congress we have to convince now,

281
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,130
不是民眾
not the public.

282
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,960
這些是選舉前我們要解決的剩下的參議員
These are the remaining senators we'll target before the vote.

283
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,780
對了  都是女人
All women, by the way.

284
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,000
最大的挑戰將是
The biggest challenges will be

285
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,870
印第安納州的新晉參議員蘇珊·紐曼
Indiana's freshman senator Susan Newman.

286
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,230
憲法律師
The constitutional lawyer?

287
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,800
以及夏威夷的凱芮·奎立馬
And Hawaii's Kerry Kuilima,

288
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,870
她似乎很高興
who seems to be enjoying

289
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,030
終于能有一次實權了
getting to wield a little power for once.

290
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,180
我必須告訴你  國會對同時為
I need to tell you, there is a lot of pushback on the Hill

291
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,120
總統和副總統投票抵觸情緒很高
about the simultaneous vote for president and VP.

292
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,580
國民很擔心這會導致總統副總統不同黨
The country is terrified it'll lead to a split ticket.

293
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,610
有人可能阻撓議事
There's threats of a filibuster.

294
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,310
參議院現在是民主黨的
Well, the Dems won the Senate,

295
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,450
他們想跟眾議院一起投票的
and they want to vote when the House does.

296
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,160
這已經決定了
That decision's been made.

297
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,920
副總統也不會允許議員以任何形式
And the vice president won't allow a filibuster of any kind

298
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,120
阻撓議事
onto the floor.

299
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,950
夫人  你有沒有考慮過這樣的結果
Ma'am, have you contemplated how it could possibly work,

300
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,540
你做康威總統的副總統
you as vice president to President Conway?

301
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,990
不會那樣的
That's not going to happen.

302
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,510
當然
Of course.

303
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,540
我倒是真知道奧古斯都·安德伍德的一件事
I did learn one true thing about Augustus Underwood.

304
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,610
什么事
What?

305
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,230
他死了  真死了
He was dead. Cold.

306
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,120
他的尸體被放在一輛馬車上...
They put him on a cart...

307
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,390
上面有好多有待埋葬的尸體
bunch of dead bodies to bury.

308
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,300
一天一夜之后...
Then, after a full day and night...

309
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,910
他醒了
he woke up.

310
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,030
什么
What?

311
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:46,220
有人偷走了他的鞋和軍服上的扣子  但是
Someone stole his shoes and the buttons off his uniform, but...

312
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,440
他活過來了
he lived.

313
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,310
幾天后  他趕上了他所在的軍團
Few days later, he caught up to his regiment.

314
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,960
真的嗎
Really?

315
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,720
我得回去面對那些混亂了
I have to get back to the madness.

316
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,240
希望還能再見到你  總統先生
I hope I get to see you again, Mr. President.

317
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,010
艾瑞克...你不參加重演活動時
Eric... what do you do when you're not,

318
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,850
都干些什么
reenacting?

319
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,330
我是一名演員
I'm an actor.

320
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,740
有時候是吧
Sometimes.

321
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,690
只要有人雇  我也可以干其它的
I mean, I'd do a lot more if someone would let me.

322
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,250
現在  我主要做私人教練
So, right now, I'm mostly a personal trainer.

323
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,550
-私人教練  -是的
- A personal trainer? - Yeah.

324
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,200
你知道我的聯系方式
You know where to find me.

325
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,580
還有  總統閣下...
And, sir...

326
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,670
不管情況看起來多糟糕...
no matter how dire things look...

327
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,690
你都能熬出頭的
you're gonna come out of this alive.

328
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,020
你畢竟是安德伍德家的人
You're an Underwood, after all.

329
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,080
不  別耍嘴皮子  埃莉諾
No, don't... don't "Chief-of-staff" me, Eleanor.

330
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,480
不  不要給我他的行程
No, don't give me his schedule.

331
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,720
我不想知道
I don't want to hear

332
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,400
羅梅洛議員在會見選民
about how Congressman Romero is meeting with his constituents

333
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,240
或是滯留在阿西樂特快上了
or stuck on an Acela train.

334
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,090
你叫法齊奧  對嗎
You know, it's Fazio, right?

335
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,770
是這么發音的吧
The pronunciation?

336
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,130
埃莉諾·法齊奧
Eleanor Fazio?

337
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,460
我只是想確認一下
I... I just want to be sure.

338
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,000
因為等總統獲勝  他一定會獲勝的
Because when the president wins, and he is going to win,

339
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,780
我會記得你的
I will remember your name.

340
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,030
我還是需要你過目一下這篇發布稿
I still need you to review this release.

341
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,370
很明顯  目標是
Now, obviously, the goal is

342
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,700
抵住"躲藏"的論調
to combat the "hiding out" narrative,

343
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,640
強調他們正在做的工作
emphasizing the work that they're doing.

344
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,240
-私事嗎  -公事
- Is it a personal matter? - Business.

345
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,540
我只有公事
It's always business.

346
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,440
我會簽好字電郵給你的
I'll e-mail you my sign off.

347
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,170
等等
Wait a second.

348
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,630
我需要他們明天的最新行程
I need an update on their schedule for tomorrow.

349
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,730
-勝利就在眼前  -告訴我你是怎么知道的
- We're almost there. - I want to know how you found out.

350
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,470
如果他需要幫助
If he needs help,

351
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,230
等他入主白宮后隨時可以找我
that can happen after he makes it to the White House.

352
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,210
馬克  你還沒有回答我的問題
Mark, you're not answering my question.

353
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,010
如果他接受治療的消息  
If word of treatment,

354
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:56,950
任何形式的治療  泄露了...
any kind of treatment, got out--

355
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,790
他的朋友給他看了那種治療方法
His friend was showing him the therapy.

356
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,940
-僅此而已  -請不要侮辱我
- That's it. - Please don't insult me.

357
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,670
你以為你是誰
Who do you think you are?

358
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,320
插手我們生活的方方面面
Inserting yourself into every aspect of our lives.

359
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,140
你丈夫的選舉需要幫助
Your husband's campaign needed help.

360
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,960
-我就伸出了援手  -是的  但是...
- Help arrived. - Yes, but--

361
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,230
這原來可是你的意思  對吧
Help that you, most of all, pushed for. Yes?

362
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,810
-誰告訴你虛擬現實療法的  -他自己說的
- Who told you about the VR therapy? - He did.

363
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,110
我們走吧
Let's go.

364
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,000
怎么了
What's going on?

365
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,940
我就是在跟馬克說我非常懷念馬歇爾在的時候
I was just telling Mark how much I miss having Marshall around.

366
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,310
他還在啊
Well, he's still around.

367
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,300
你要去哪
Where are you going?

368
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,190
我忘拿包了
I forgot my bag.

369
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,780
就在這里
It's right here.

370
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,530
喂  是的
Hello. Yeah.

371
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,140
是的  他在
Yes, sir, he's right here.

372
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:44,900
是他
It's him.

373
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,360
議員先生
Congressman.

374
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,820
你根本不知道這可能會多糟
You have no idea how bad this could get.

375
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,920
我們可別遲到
We don't wanna be late.

376
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,220
我萬分贊同
Well, I couldn't agree more.

377
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,680
她可能去了圣達菲
She might have gone to Santa Fe.

378
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,130
你不相信我  是嗎
You don't believe me, do you?

379
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:17,050
我需要看到點切實的東西  麗薩
I would need to see something, Lisa. Something concrete.

380
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,580
我有照片  我有一張
I have a photo. I have one, but...

381
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,190
聽我說
Listen.

382
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,580
看著我
Look at me.

383
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,140
你不是第一個來找我對安德伍德和他手下
You're not the first person to come here making false claims

384
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,200
提出虛假指控的人了
about Underwood and his cronies.

385
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,520
但我說的是實話
But I'm telling the truth.

386
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,130
但你說的一切都可能是報紙上讀來的
Everything you're saying you could've read in the paper.

387
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,700
我就是這樣知道他的身份的  因為報紙登了
That's how I realized who he was. His picture in the paper.

388
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,900
這樣你的說法就更難證實了  我們在兜圈子
Which makes your story harder to prove. We're talking in circles.

389
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,530
那我車壞掉時  道格·斯坦普開車送我回家呢
What about Doug Stamper driving me home when my car broke down,

390
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,760
還跟我說他叫彼得  是賣保險的
telling me his name was Peter and that he sold insurance?

391
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,950
-沒人能證實你的說法  -瑞秋
- No one can corroborate that story. - Rachel!

392
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,330
瑞秋可以
Rachel could.

393
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,000
-你該吃完  -我不餓
- You should finish that. - I'm not hungry.

394
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,960
或許我餓了  我不知道
Maybe I am. I don't know.

395
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,590
我想感謝你來聯絡我
I want to thank you for reaching out.

396
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,670
我不是說我不相信你
I am not saying I don't believe you.

397
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,610
但已經有足夠可以
But there's already enough evidence out there

398
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,360
扳倒總統的證據了
to take the president down.

399
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,100
這次選舉  會讓他背負更多罪責
And now, with this election, he'll be accountable for even more.

400
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,320
-我確定  -我不在乎
- I'm certain of it. - I don't care.

401
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,450
我不在乎安德伍德  我要你去找道格·斯坦普
I don't care about Underwood. I want you to talk to Doug Stamper.

402
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,610
我要你查明我的...
I want you to find out what happened to my...

403
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,450
算了  拉倒吧
Whatever, forget it.

404
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,410
-等等  -謝謝你的三明治
- Uh. Hold on. - Thanks for the sandwich.

405
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,010
好吧  等等
All right. Hold on.

406
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,990
有一個關于林登·約翰遜的故事我很喜歡
There's a story that I love about LBJ.

407
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,020
那是64或65年的時候
Uh, it was back in '64 or '65.

408
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,150
有個議員在躲他  那議員回到自己的辦公室
A congressman was ducking him... and he came back to his office

409
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,520
總統就坐在他的椅子上
to find the president sitting in his chair...

410
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,070
等著他
waiting for him.

411
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,630
總統一小時內要見到你
The president expects to see you within the hour.

412
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,730
法齊奧小姐會告訴你具體情況
Miss Fazio can give you the specifics.

413
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,660
-他戴著牛仔帽  -什么
- He was wearing his cowboy hat. - What?

414
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,050
約翰遜總統  你漏掉了故事最精彩的部分
President Johnson. You left out the best part of the story.

415
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,320
我們昨晚玩到那里閉店  多謝邀請
We closed the place down last night. Thanks for the invite.

416
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,980
我們幾個人今晚還去那里
Bunch of us are headed back to the same spot tonight,

417
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,910
要一起來嗎
if you wanna come.

418
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,860
好啊  他今天午飯吃的晚  4點才會回來
Cool. Uh, he has a late lunch today. Won't be back till 4:00.

419
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,300
-我就是來送這個  -好
- Oh, I just needed to drop this for him. - Sure.

420
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,590
下次  問就好
Next time, just ask.

421
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,610
今晚見
See you tonight.

422
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,610
你賭了一把  但輸了
You gambled and you lost.

423
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,600
其實  跟八周前比  我黨團席位增多了
Actually, my bloc gained seats more than eight weeks ago.

424
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,320
我猜你就是為這事找我
Which I suspect is why I'm here.

425
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,390
別高估了你的位置
Don't overestimate your position.

426
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,150
或是低估了我的
Or underestimate mine.

427
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,850
你還沒當選總統呢  先生
You still haven't been elected president, sir.

428
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,370
是啊  但如果黨派背棄了你
Yeah, but the presidency won't matter

429
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,920
總統之職就無所謂了吧
once the party turns its back on you, will it?

430
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,950
等鮑勃·博奇教訓好了你其他的綿羊
When Bob Birch puts all the rest of your sheep in line,

431
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,830
你會求著不被孤立
you'll be begging to come in from the cold.

432
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,870
兩年后  你會回到鳳凰城
And two years from now, you'll be back in Phoenix

433
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,550
一遍遍在腦海里回顧這一刻
replaying this very moment over and over again in your mind

434
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,890
意識到  這就是結束的開始
and realizing it was the beginning of the end.

435
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,750
帕特里夏·惠特克和民主黨
Patricia Whittaker and the Democratic Party

436
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,320
會跟你撇清關系
will wipe their hands of you.

437
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,860
-我是忠于黨的  -那是應該的
- I'm loyal to the party. - As you should be.

438
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,420
你應該這么說
As you should say.

439
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,570
但說真的
But really...

440
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,680
你有什么籌碼
what's your leverage?

441
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,420
委員會  那已經完了
The committee? That's done.

442
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,470
瞧  你已經獻了身  艾力克斯
You see, you've already put out, Alex,

443
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,760
威爾·康威卻不打算帶你去舞會
and Will Conway is not taking you to the prom.

444
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,140
我跟州長的談話
My conversations with the governor

445
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,140
和我可能的立場...
and any position that I may or may not have--

446
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,930
聽聽自己的話  你相信自己嗎
Oh, listen to yourself. Do you even believe you?

447
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,290
你作為一個
You are awfully confident

448
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,600
已經輸了一次選舉的人  好自信啊
for someone who's already lost the election once.

449
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,280
幫個忙  暫時忘記總統的事
Do me a favor. Forget the presidency for just a moment.

450
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,950
你沒有...資本
You don't have... the capital

451
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,960
來推動你掀起的國會革命
to build on the congressional revolution that you've started,

452
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,840
不管是政治上還是其他的
politically or otherwise.

453
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,600
我們的運動想讓事態爆發
Our movement wants to explode things--

454
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,980
得了  少拿那套革新派公關套路我
Oh, please. Spare me your progressive PR bullshit.

455
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,960
你和他們想要的東西一樣
You want what they all want.

456
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,380
權力  更好的地位
Access. A better seat at the table.

457
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,480
你的名字在他人之前
Your name before the rest.

458
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,220
這我可以給你
And that is something that I can give you.

459
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,120
你想換取多少選票呢
And how many votes do you want in exchange?

460
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
你不斷增長的黨團給我三張就行
Just three from your ever-growing bloc

461
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,190
我就能在關鍵代表團獲得勝利
would assure me the win in key delegations.

462
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,340
具體點
Specifically?

463
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:06,030
緬因州  威斯康星州和新罕布什爾還未定
Maine, Wisconsin and New Hampshire are still in play.

464
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,340
三個全要
All three?

465
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,790
我相信你  議員  想知道為什么嗎
I believe in you, Congressman. Do you wanna know why?

466
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,780
說吧
Tell me.

467
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,490
因為我相信野心
Because I trust ambition.

468
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,440
-那這是直截了當的賄賂嘍  -不  議員
- So this is a straight-up bribe. - Oh, no, Congressman.

469
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,200
賄賂是你可以拒絕的
A bribe is something you can refuse.

470
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,730
鑒于你的經驗沒有我豐富
Now, since you haven't been around the block as many times as I have,

471
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,430
我來教教你這事怎么辦吧
let me walk you through how this works.

472
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,960
抱歉  總統  但我知道是怎么回事
Excuse me, Mr. President, but I do know how this is done.

473
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,440
那太好了
Oh, well, that's good to hear.

474
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,880
我從緬因州開始吧  她欠我的
I'll start with Maine. She owes me.

475
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,550
我們以前見過一次的  總統先生
You know, we did meet once before, Mr. President.

476
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,850
2012年大會的一次晚宴上
At a dinner, during the 2012 convention.

477
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,460
-我還想向你自我介紹來著  -然后呢
- I tried to introduce myself to you... - And?

478
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,850
-你不記得我了  是嗎  -為什么要記得呢
- You don't remember, do you? - Why would I?

479
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,690
主持人為什么那么在意布洛哈特的意見
Why is the moderator so interested in Brockhart's opinion?

480
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,540
所有人都突然忘記我才是總統候選人了嗎
Has everyone suddenly forgotten now I'm at the top of the ticket?

481
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,820
當然沒有
No, of course not.

482
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,440
結束了嗎
Are we done here?

483
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,340
是啊  我們談談明天的日程吧
Yeah. We should talk about tomorrow's schedule.

484
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,620
目前票數不錯
Uh, vote's looking good now.

485
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,710
我們還得盡量多找些議員談
We still need to talk to as many congressmen as we can.

486
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,400
你去安排  然后打給我們
Well, you figure it out and give us a call.

487
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,240
別再安排針對軍事委員會的活動了
And, uh, enough with the events targeting the Armed Services.

488
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,620
我們在這邊拉票已經到極限了
We got as many Congress people as we could get out of this.

489
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,070
別介意  將軍  但我們該分頭行動  好嗎
No offense, General, but we need to divide and conquer. Okay?

490
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,970
威爾  我之前跟馬克談了
Will, I was speaking with Mark...

491
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,000
-怎么  -我想告訴你
- Yeah. - ...and I want you to know,

492
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,410
如果你需要談什么  我隨時奉陪
if you need to talk about anything, I'm available.

493
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,710
我唯一需要的支持  將軍
The only support I need, General...

494
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,590
就是一個副總統對總統的支持  好嗎
is that of a vice president to his president. Okay?

495
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:10,220
塔伯特參議員的首要考慮是經濟適用房
Senator Talbert's priorities are affordable housing

496
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,100
和堵住企業稅務漏洞
and closing corporate tax loopholes.

497
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,530
尤其是高等教育普及
And access to higher education especially.

498
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,010
通話在10點
The call is in ten.

499
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,020
艾丹·麥卡倫為什么跑了
Why did Aidan Macallan run away?

500
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,090
什么
What?

501
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,410
麥卡倫為什么跑了
Why did Macallan run away?

502
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,630
我也不知道
I wish I could tell you.

503
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,310
時間不多了
Clock's ticking.

504
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,240
請給我湯姆·耶茨司機的號碼
Yes, give me Tom Yates' driver's number, please.

505
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,940
喂
Yes.

506
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,710
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

507
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,080
紐約
New York.

508
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,460
你一路開去了紐約
You drove all the way to New York?

509
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,870
在哪
Where?

510
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,650
他跟誰在一起
Who's he with?

511
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,970
我不知道  一個女人  年紀較長
I don't know. A woman. Older.

512
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,580
我不知道那要怎么做  夫人
I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.

513
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,250
是  我試試
Yes. Yes, I'll try.

514
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,610
不  我理解你的擔憂  參議員
No, I understand your concern, Senator.

515
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,010
學生貸款改革是你的優先考慮
Student loan reform is a priority for you,

516
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,560
那么它就也是總統和我的優先考慮
so it will be a priority for the president and me.

517
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,070
是的  沒錯
Yes. Yes, I do.

518
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,120
露易絲  你是黨派中流砥柱
Well, Louise, you as a pillar of the party,

519
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,370
如果你明天能幫我  我會感激不盡
it will be much appreciated if I can get your help tomorrow.

520
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,430
到時就你和我  還有幾個你的
And it'll just be you and me and a couple of your...

521
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,400
參議院女同事
female colleagues in the Senate.

522
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:05,500
好  那么我期待與你有成效地談談
Okay, well, I look forward to a productive dialogue.

523
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,180
-遲到總比不來好  -抱歉我錯過了晚餐
- Better late than never. - Sorry I missed dinner.

524
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,880
為什么坐后面
Why the back?

525
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,720
我在假裝你是優步  幫幫忙
I'm pretending you're an Uber. Just help me out.

526
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,750
我的小姑子  你沒來她就來了
My sister-in-law. She came when you couldn't.

527
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,530
你覺得死者會鄙視我們嗎
Do you think the dead judge us?

528
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,180
不會
No.

529
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,890
你最喜歡他做什么
What did he do that you liked the most?

530
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,060
在床上
Here... in bed.

531
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,560
坐姿最好
Sitting up was the best.

532
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,780
腿纏著彼此
Legs around each other.

533
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,550
他會把右手
He'd run his right hand

534
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,530
伸到我脖子后面  插進我的頭發里拽著
up the back of my neck into my hair and pull it.

535
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,110
把我的頭發和腦袋往后拽
My hair and my head back...

536
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,340
然后呢
And?

537
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,510
然后用另一只手  把我拉進拉出
And with the other hand, he'd pull me in and out.

538
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,680
他始終看著我
Always looking at me.

539
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,640
看到我
Seeing me.

540
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,770
你要我那么做嗎
You want me to do that?

541
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,830
嗯
Yeah.

542
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,340
這里真好  幾乎聽不到他們的吼聲
It's so nice in here. You can hardly hear them.

543
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,160
相信我  我聽得到的
Oh, trust me, I can hear them.

544
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,900
加上新罕布什爾  多少了
With New Hampshire, it's what?

545
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,800
24  加緬因州25
Twenty-four. With Maine, 25.

546
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,160
-如果拿下威斯康星就是26  -湯姆呢
- Twenty-six if we get Wisconsin. - Where's Tom?

547
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,360
他去喘口氣了
He needed to get some air.

548
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,130
-威斯康星很頑固  -那還有誰
- Wisconsin is being stubborn. - Then who else?

549
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,540
愛荷華  或許科羅拉多  那是24  25
Iowa, maybe Colorado, 24, 25.

550
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,680
你的曾曾曾祖父奧古斯都怎么樣了
How was your great-great-great-grandfather Augustus?

551
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,090
他叫艾瑞克
He goes by Eric.

552
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,090
艾瑞克
Eric.

553
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,640
他很欣賞我的手藝
He admired my craftsmanship.

554
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,220
-我們該爭取一下北達科他  -同意
- We should make a play for North Dakota. - Agreed.

555
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,670
在參議院  你應該可以拉密蘇里的票
In the Senate, I think you can swing some votes from Missouri.

556
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,050
你問莉安麥卡倫的事了嗎
Did you ask LeAnn about Macallan?

557
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,500
她并不知情  我相信她
She didn't know anything. I believe her.

558
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,360
我們又得戒了
We have to quit again.

559
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,000
否則  會害死我們的
Otherwise, they'll kill us.

560
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:56,050
麥卡倫不見蹤影  但他去過那兒  留下了財物
No Macallan. He was there, though. Left his belongings.

561
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,570
國家警察那里有消息嗎
Anything from the National Police?

562
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,630
沒有  中情局的內部人士
No. CIA's man in the palace

563
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,700
甚至不確定他是否還在雅加達
isn't even sure he's still in Jakarta.

564
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,000
他們會找到他的  莉安  我只能說這么多
They'll find him, LeAnn. That's all I can give you.

565
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,220
多謝幫忙
I appreciate your help.

566
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,140
凱芮  蘇珊  需要點什么
Kerry, Susan, what can I get you?

567
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,800
-不用  謝謝  -水就行
- I'm fine, thanks. - I'm good with water.

568
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,330
-你呢  露易絲  -你喝什么
- What about you, Louise? - What are you having?

569
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,440
-伏特加加冰  -給我也來一杯
- Splash of vodka on ice. - Make it two.

570
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:28,280
蘇珊和我來的路上談了  克萊爾
Susan and I were talking on the way over, Claire.

571
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,050
這場選舉的混亂讓我們
This election mess has left us

572
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,060
都面臨著一些可怕的可能性
all facing some scary possibilities.

573
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,940
-康威拿下眾議院  -這還遠非定數
- Conway wins in the House-- - Which is far from inevitable.

574
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,940
但如果真發生總統副總統不同黨
But if a split ticket were to happen...

575
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,920
那對國家會不利的
it would be bad for this country.

576
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,580
不  康威才對國家不利
No, Conway is what would be bad for this country.

577
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:45,040
希望眾議院能做出正確選擇
Let's hope the House does the right thing.

578
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,670
但就參議院而言
But as far as the Senate,

579
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,630
我很高興有唐納德·布萊斯掌舵
I am very grateful that we have Donald Blythe steering that ship.

580
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,710
安德伍德夫人  我很抱歉這么說
Mrs. Underwood, I'm sorry to say this,

581
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,440
但不管你能拿出什么
but no matter what you're offering here,

582
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,230
我都不能支持總統
I can't support the president.

583
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:59,500
也因此不能支持你
And, by extension, I can't support you.

584
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,710
不是你的問題  克萊爾  是他
It's not you, Claire. It's him.

585
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,460
蘇珊和我在這事上的意見是一致的
Susan and I are on the same page about this.

586
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,300
如果重點不是弗蘭西斯·安德伍德呢
What if this isn't about Francis Underwood, huh?

587
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:13,150
前途大好的是克萊爾·安德伍德
It's Claire Underwood who has the promising future.

588
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,590
我希望一個女人入主白宮
I want a woman in the White House.

589
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,740
如果她得從副總統做起  那好
And if she has to start as a vice president, fine.

590
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,050
但時候到了
But it's time.

591
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,950
-時候到了  -我贊同  露易絲
- It's time. - I hear that, Louise,

592
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,530
但我直說吧
but I'll say it...

593
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,070
投票給你  就是投給弗蘭克·安德伍德
A vote for you is a vote for Frank Underwood.

594
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,780
我理解你們對弗蘭西斯歷史的擔憂  真的
Listen, I understand your concerns about Francis' record. I do.

595
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,150
如果康威贏了
If Conway wins,

596
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,190
難道你們不希望有個民主黨人克制著他嗎
wouldn't you want a Democrat to keep him in check?

597
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,750
如果給我投票不等于給弗蘭西斯投票呢
And what if a vote for me isn't necessarily a vote for Francis?

598
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,520
21票確定是你  先生
Twenty-one promised for you, sir.

599
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,050
康威是23
Twenty-three for Conway.

600
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,990
兩個僵持  四個未知
Two deadlocked. Four unknown.

601
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,650
但我覺得黨團會議之后情況會變動
But I think things will shift once they caucus.

602
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,660
-好  叫他進來  -是  先生
- All right, let's bring him in. - Yes, sir.

603
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,350
-請坐  -我不久留
- Have a seat. - I won't be long.

604
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,030
那就站著吧
Well, then, stand like a man

605
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,240
像個不知是否該坐下的人
who doesn't know whether to sit or not.

606
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,660
羅梅洛議員  你為我帶來好消息了嗎
Congressman Romero, do you have good news for me?

607
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,780
你的革新人士想明白了嗎
Have your progressives seen the light?

608
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,010
我已經盡力了  總統先生  我無法說服他們
I did what I could, Mr. President. I couldn't sway the bloc.

609
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,510
無法  還是不愿
Couldn't... or wouldn't?

610
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,420
緬因和新罕布什爾還不明朗
Maine and New Hampshire are noncommittal.

611
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,560
沃考特議員在讓威斯康星支持康威
Congressman Wolcott is turning Wisconsin for Conway.

612
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,560
告訴我點別的事實
Tell me a different truth.

613
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,340
他們不聽我的
They aren't listening to me.

614
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,030
他們相信  與讓康威當選相比
They believe supporting you would do more damage

615
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,150
支持你會給民主黨和國家造成更大損害
to the Democratic Party and the country than a Conway presidency.

616
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,160
很遺憾  竟然走到這一步
Well, I am sorry that it has come to this.

617
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,390
我也是  我們肯定還會再見的  先生
As am I. I'm sure we'll meet again, sir.

618
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,580
是啊  但你走之前  好好看看這間屋子
Yes, but before you go, just take a look around this room.

619
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,310
仔細看每處細節  每個方面
Study every detail, every aspect.

620
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,700
因為這是你最后一次踏進這里了
Because this is the last time you will ever step foot in here.

621
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,100
抱歉我沒幫上更多忙
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.

622
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,770
想想吧  你本能讓自己因為很多其他事
And to think you could have made yourself memorable

623
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,720
被世人銘記的
in so many other ways.

624
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,630
我會確保他再進不了其他委員會  先生
I'll make sure he never sees another committee, sir.

625
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,540
不  他希望我們還擊  讓他感覺更強大
Oh, no. He wants us to put up a fight, make him feel bigger.

626
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,190
他只不過是看了民調數據  就以為我有麻煩
He's just read some polls and thinks I'm in trouble.

627
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,920
所以他才攻擊我
That's why he's coming after me.

628
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,430
好吧  我們有48小時
All right, we have 48 hours.

629
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,400
我得攻下科羅拉多  穩住田納西
I have to work Colorado and shore up Tennessee.

630
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,530
但哪怕不惜一切  也要讓
But Maine, Wisconsin and New hampshire

631
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,170
緬因  威斯康星和新罕布什爾回心轉意
must be turned by any means necessary.

632
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,570
所有黨團會議周四中午之前都會結束
All caucusing will end by noon on Thursday,

633
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,730
下午兩點
and then the vote in both

634
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,400
參眾兩院開始投票
the House and the Senate is scheduled for 2:00.

635
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,420
我不做決定  查克  我只是傳達而已
Well... I don't make the decisions, Chuck. I just relay them.

636
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,250
不  不  目前不做聲明
No. No, there will not be a statement at this time.

637
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,880
因為投票結果出來前無話可說
Well, because there's nothing to state until after the vote.

638
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,080
關上門
Close the door.

639
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,190
嗯  對
Right. Yes.

640
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,220
對
Yes.

641
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:30,950
求你別再逼我說"對"了
Yeah, please don't make me say yes again.

642
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,570
美國現在真是瘋了
Crazy days in these United States.

643
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,880
你想告訴我  是什么重要到
So you wanna tell me what was so important

644
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,340
我得放你進來
I had to get you through the gates?

645
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,500
有個叫麗薩·威廉姆斯的女孩來過
Girl named Lisa Williams came in.

646
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,260
說她曾是瑞秋·波斯納的女朋友
Says she was Rachel Posner's girlfriend.

647
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,810
她說道格·斯坦普認識瑞秋
Said Doug Stamper knew Rachel.

648
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,650
覺得他可能和瑞秋失蹤有關
Feels like maybe he was involved in her disappearance.

649
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,830
她說道格·斯坦普這個名字了嗎
And she said the words "Doug Stamper"?

650
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,640
瑞秋·波斯納失蹤的時間
Rachel Posner went missing around the time

651
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
正好是斯坦普被劫車  腦袋被砸的時候
Stamper was carjacked and had his head bashed in.

652
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,030
這個麗薩覺得
And this Lisa thinks...

653
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,110
她也不太確定
Well, she's not sure exactly.

654
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,400
她能證明其中有聯系嗎
Well, can she prove a connection?

655
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,890
現在都只是直覺
It's all instinct at this point.

656
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,950
拜托
Come on.

657
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,260
你要是想參觀白宮
You want a tour of the White House,

658
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,090
可以直接跟我說嘛
you could just straight up ask me for one.

659
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,600
-漢默施密特  -他看重這事嗎
- Hammerschmidt. - Is he making anything of it?

660
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,710
還不  但關于她的資料已經在他桌上了
Not yet. But the information about her is on the top of his desk.

661
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,900
麗薩·威廉姆斯
Lisa Williams.

662
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,250
格雷森先生  三號線有人找
Mr. Grayson, you have a call on line three.

663
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,930
我得工作了
Well, I gotta get back to it.

664
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,560
要是湯姆繼續跟進她  就告訴我
If Tom follows up on her, let me know.

665
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,170
-謝謝你給的通行證  -是臨時的
- Thanks for the pass. - It's temporary.

666
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,150
好吧
Okay.

667
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:55,020
-莉安·哈維  -你總熬夜
- LeAnn Harvey. - Always burning the midnight oil.

668
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,820
-艾丹  -你準備好來找我了嗎
- Aidan? - You ready to join me?

669
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,530
你知道你把我推進了多危險的境地嗎
Do you have any idea how much jeopardy you have put me in?

670
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,790
你應該趁還有機會逃出來
You should've gotten out when you had the chance.

671
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,340
你覺得你就逃出來了
You think you're out?

672
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,020
-聽著  我需要你幫我個忙  -你在哪
- Listen, I need you to do me a favor. - Where are you?

673
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,940
讓聯調局  中情局
Get the FBI, CIA,

674
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,970
和其他在找我的人都停下  馬上
and whoever else is looking for me to stop, now.

675
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,810
好  艾丹  你就
Okay, Aidan, you know, just...

676
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,560
先回來  我們一起想辦法
come back here, and we will figure this out together.

677
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,920
要是他們繼續找我
If they keep coming after me,

678
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,030
我就開始泄露關于安德伍德夫婦的秘密
I will start leaking things about the Underwoods.

679
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,100
你不想那么做的
You don't wanna do that.

680
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,750
你不知道你現在是在為什么人工作  莉安
You have no idea who you're working for, LeAnn.

681
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,010
該死
God damn it.

682
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,960
有新情況向總統匯報嗎
You have an update for the president?

683
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,300
我今天基本上一直在忙著應付參議員
I've been juggling senators most of the day.

684
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,090
你那緬因州的議員呢
And your congressman from Maine?

685
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,100
依然是我朋友的父親  依然沒時間見面
Is still my friend's father and is still too busy to meet.

686
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
威斯康星和新罕布什爾也一樣
So was Wisconsin and New Hampshire,

687
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,250
我逼他們就見到了
until I forced them to.

688
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,960
你有你的風格  我有我的
You have your style, I have mine.

689
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,790
總統不在乎風格  莉安
The president doesn't care about style, LeAnn.

690
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,330
周四前把議員的票拉到位就行
Just get the congressman by the vote on Thursday.

691
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,180
威爾剛進來了
Will just walked in.

692
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,560
嗯
Yeah.

693
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,320
行
Okay.

694
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,240
再聯系  拜
Talk soon. Bye.

695
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,730
-你媽媽  -對  她向你問好
- That your mom? - Yeah. She sends her best.

696
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,830
好吧
Yeah.

697
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,900
-查理人呢  -在客廳
- Where's Charlie? - In the living room.

698
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,730
莉莉在小房間玩
Lily's playing in the den.

699
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,010
-你要去哪  -我該換衣服了
- Where are you going? - I should change.

700
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:41,100
-你一直躲著我  漢娜  -拜托
- You keep walking away from me, Hannah. - Oh, please.

701
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,690
你為什么邀請他來
Why would you invite him here?

702
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,580
這個時候
Now?

703
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,360
他是朋友  你的朋友
He's a friend. He's your friend.

704
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,100
我想也許...
And I thought maybe...

705
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,180
你會有興趣看一看
it'd be something that you'd be interested in looking at.

706
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,250
我在盡力而為
I'm doing all I can.

707
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,510
-盡力而為  -是的
- All you can? - Yes.

708
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,540
質疑我
Like doubt me?

709
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,540
以為你比我更了解我自己的精神狀況
Like think that you know better what's in my mind than I do?

710
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,190
要知道  是你告訴馬克的
You know, you're the one who told Mark.

711
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,060
我還得否認我跟那事有關
I had to deny I had anything to do with it.

712
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,440
要知道這些人  漢娜  厄舍和馬歇爾
See, these people, Hannah... Usher and Marshall...

713
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,860
他們是雇工  不能信他們
they're hired hands. They can't be trusted.

714
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,350
布洛哈特也是為了自己
And Brockhart, he's in it for himself.

715
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,930
但你...親愛的  我的愛人
But... but you, my darling, my love--

716
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,710
-別說了  -別說什么
- Stop it. - Stop what?

717
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,500
你能怎么樣  帶孩子回娘家
What are you gonna do? Take the kids and go to your mom?

718
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,760
你不會這么做的
As if you would.

719
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,070
你連白宮的瓷器都挑好了
You already picked out the White House china.

720
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,760
你最大的心愿就是當上總統
You want this more than anything. To be president.

721
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,630
這也成了我的心愿  你膽敢來指責我
Don't you dare judge me now that I want it, too.

722
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,710
是  議員  安排航程也算賄賂
Yes, Congressman, but flights are considered bribes.

723
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,770
是  議員  我們擔心的不是你的酒駕
Yes, Congressman, it's not your DUIs that concern us,

724
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,420
而是你女兒的
it's your daughter's.

725
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,810
那你本該把開銷藏得更深
Well, you should've done a better job hiding the payouts.

726
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,490
拜托
I mean, really.

727
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,690
嗯  我相信你是  他多大來著
Yes, I'm sure you are... but how old was he again?

728
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,280
對  他參加過合唱團  對吧
Yes, and he was in the choir, is that right?

729
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,990
但你沒法把郵件刪得不留痕跡
But you can never erase an e-mail,

730
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,470
我過世的姑姑都知道
even my dead aunt knows that.

731
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:20,970
好吧  你盡快回復我
Well, get back to me as soon as you can.

732
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,620
-怎么樣  -緬因州終于搞定了  先生
- So? - Maine finally looks solid, sir.

733
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,370
但新罕布什爾還沒有
New Hampshire doesn't, though.

734
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,430
我坐在這里好幾個小時
I've been sitting in here for hours

735
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,540
想方設法取得了一些成效
busting my ass, getting some results.

736
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,530
我們本應拿下新罕布什爾的
We should have secured New Hampshire.

737
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,010
莉安怎么拿下緬因州的
How did LeAnn get Maine?

738
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,630
對方欠她人情
She cashed in a favor.

739
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,690
那你為什么不能用同一招
Well, why couldn't you do the same goddamn thing?

740
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,440
我想不通
It doesn't make sense.

741
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,860
我以為我說服他了
I thought I had him. I mean...

742
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,850
不只是新罕布什爾  威斯康星本來也該拿下的
And it's not just New Hampshire. Wisconsin should've folded.

743
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,870
本來
Should have?

744
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,640
怎么回事  道格  你怎么了
What's going on, Doug? What's happening?

745
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,070
是你的投入  還是忠心出了問題
Is there some issue with your commitment? Your loyalty?

746
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,830
什么
What?

747
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:03,110
或許你就不值得我信任
Perhaps you just aren't worthy of my trust.

748
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,020
我為你費盡心力
I have given everything to you.

749
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,300
我的整個職業生涯幾乎都給了你  弗蘭克
Almost the entirety of my professional life, Frank.

750
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,600
你注意語氣
You watch your tone.

751
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:14,070
我做的那些事...
The things I've done...

752
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,920
為了保住你的位子  我做的那些事...
The things that I have done to help keep you here,

753
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,680
你居然還質疑我的忠心
and you're gonna question my loyalty?

754
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,470
如果我們不能贏
Well, if we can't win,

755
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,720
那我們得確保康威也不能贏
we have to make sure that Conway doesn't either.

756
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,380
緬因州支持我們  那他就拿不到26票
Maine coming over only means he won't get to 26.

757
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,720
僵局不是勝局  但至少...
A deadlock isn't a win. But at least...

758
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,270
抱歉  道格  我剛才失態了
I'm sorry, Doug. I was out of line.

759
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,440
我們繼續工作吧
Let's get back to work.

760
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,430
不只是他如何處理了那些數據
It's not just what he did with all the data.

761
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,350
艾丹之前能接觸到一切
Aidan had access to everything.

762
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:55,890
我們得讓中情局和聯調局不去查他
We need to get the CIA and FBI off his trail,

763
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:56,980
我需要你的幫助
and I need your help.

764
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,470
你在制造麻煩  莉安
You're causing problems, LeAnn,

765
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,740
我們現在最要不得麻煩了
which is the last thing that we can afford right now.

766
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,330
麥卡倫是作繭自縛
Macallan sealed his own fate.

767
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,000
我拿下了緬因州  道格
I delivered Maine, Doug,

768
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
你可沒處理好新罕布什爾
which is more than you can say about New Hampshire.

769
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,360
算我欠你人情
I'll owe you.

770
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,510
還不夠
Not enough.

771
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,030
總統跟你說過艾丹的事嗎
Has the president spoken to you about Aidan at all?

772
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,850
沒有
No.

773
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,970
他在狙殺名單上嗎
Is he on a kill list?

774
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,890
美利堅合眾國沒有狙殺名單  莉安
The United States of America doesn't have kill lists, LeAnn.

775
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,710
我是唯一阻止麥卡公布他手上的東西的人
I am the only thing preventing Mac from releasing what he has.

776
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,220
我猜不管那是什么  你也牽涉其中
And my guess is, whatever it is, it'll implicate you, too.

777
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,450
我錯了嗎  道格
Am I wrong, Doug?

778
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,480
米切爾參議員身邊的人告訴了我這消息
Someone close to Senator Mitchell woke me up with the news.

779
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,950
讓副總統接電話
Get me the vice president on the phone.

780
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,100
沒用
That is not going to help.

781
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,930
你打算怎么處理
Well, how do you intend on dealing with it?

782
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,400
唐納德
Donald.

783
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,960
-別這么做  -克萊爾
- Don't do it. - Claire--

784
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:26,410
我知道你和米切爾參議員在謀劃什么
I know what you and Senator Mitchell were planning.

785
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,650
做你本該做的事
Do what you were supposed to do.

786
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,110
取消阻撓議事  好讓參議院能投票
Move the anti-filibuster measure forward so the Senate can vote

787
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,250
-選我擔任副總統  -不行
- and elect me vice president. - No.

788
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,550
-不行  -各方聲音都應該被聽到
- No? - All voices should be heard

789
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,860
出于對美國人民的尊重
out of respect for the American people

790
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,480
也因為今天參議院投票的重要性
and the gravity of the vote before the Senate today,

791
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,850
自1825年起  這還是首次
the first like this since 1825.

792
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:46,330
眾議院即將投票  唐納德  怎么回事
The House is about to vote, Donald. What is going on?

793
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,460
我們把這事弄完  你就能回家了
Let's get this done so you can go home.

794
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,880
看上去康威要贏了
It looks like Conway is going to win.

795
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:53,750
不管別人跟你說了什么
And no matter what people have told you,

796
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,390
參議院會投給布洛哈特
the Senate is voting for Brockhart.

797
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,120
-國家高于政黨  克萊爾  -你在耍滑頭嗎
- It's country over party, Claire. - Are you flexing?

798
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,830
我想拖到眾議院完成投票
I'm stalling until the House vote happens

799
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,990
好讓參議院據結果投票
and then the Senate votes accordingly.

800
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,440
你要那樣對待
You'd do that to the party

801
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:06,220
你將全部事業傾注其中的政黨嗎
to which you've devoted your entire career?

802
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,320
國家需要透明和決議
The country needs clarity and resolution.

803
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,770
那是最重要的事
That's the most important thing.

804
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,980
四年后還會有選舉
There'll be another election in four years.

805
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,260
但聽我說
But look...

806
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,930
弗蘭西斯昏迷時  我看到了你的樣子
I saw you when Francis was in the coma.

807
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,540
當得到機會時你展現出的能力
What you're capable of when given the opportunity.

808
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,280
你今后還有機會  我會為你投票
You still have a shot down the road. I'd vote for you.

809
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:29,590
不管你怎么想  我知道我票數夠了
Whatever you think, I know I have the numbers.

810
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,280
我不這么認為
I don't think so.

811
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:33,980
但拜托
But come on.

812
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,900
你不像他  耐心點
You're not like him. Be patient.

813
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,880
你是個傻瓜  唐納德  一直都是
You're a fool, Donald. You always were.

814
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,950
你和你三句不離的那個蠢亡妻
You and your dumb, dead wife that you never, ever shut up about.

815
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,400
有原則  理想主義
Principled? Idealistic?

816
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:55,970
捍衛人民  你實際做過什么
A champion for the people? What did you ever actually do?

817
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,230
什么也沒有
Nothing.

818
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,200
偉大的斗士  我看不是
The great crusader? I don't think so.

819
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,370
你只是喜歡你現在這副傻瓜的樣子
You just liked the position of the bumbling idiot that you are.

820
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,050
樂觀主義者  理想主義者
The optimist. The idealist.

821
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,820
你太喜歡了以至于你甚至不能達成一筆協議
You loved it so much that you couldn't even make a deal

822
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,680
或者推進一件事
or move a single thing forward.

823
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,200
你什么也沒有留下
You have a legacy of nothing.

824
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,980
取消阻撓議事  讓共和黨別礙事
Sign the measure, get the Republicans off the floor,

825
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,950
馬上開始投票
start the vote now.

826
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,480
你知道我剛剛意識到什么嗎
Do you know what I just realized?

827
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,180
你的姓名首字母
Your initials...

828
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,730
少了N和T[賤人]
they're missing an "N" and a "T".

829
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:11,400
投票無結果  總統先生
The vote is inconclusive, Mr. President.

830
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,330
你和康威都沒達到26票
Neither you nor Conway to 26.

831
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,930
還有機會  克萊爾怎么樣
Still alive. What about Claire?

832
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,420
這不可能
This is impossible.

833
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,530
我和你一樣驚訝
I'm as surprised as you are.

834
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,790
緬因州  毫無征兆
Maine. There was no heads-up on that.

835
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,450
我知道這令人沮喪  這本該結束了
Look, I know this is frustrating. It should be over.

836
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,480
我是總統
I... I'm the president.

837
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,560
我不管他們說什么  我
I don't care what they say, I...

838
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,110
我就是該死的美國總統
I'm fucking President of the United States.

839
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,040
不  你不是
No, you're not.

840
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,670
直到眾議院做出決定
The vice president will be acting president

841
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:46,580
副總統將代總統職
for as long as it takes the House to decide.

842
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,560
我該去打幾個電話
I should make some calls.

844
00:49:38,680 --> 00:50:38,680
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}美國總統選舉的過程是  選舉日注冊選民投票
(有的州在選舉日前也可以投票  但有的州只能在當日投票)
投票結束后開始計票  媒體根據計票結果  用自己的模型得出各州結果
拿到271張選舉人票為勝  如果是平局  則由眾議院投票決定總統
但媒體公布結果后  具體的計票還要繼續  直到統計出所有的選票
如果哪個州結果過于相近  按部分州的法律  會自動啟動重新計票
計票結束后  選舉委員會確定勝者  一般由州長來簽名認證
需注意的是  根據法律  投票日選的其實不是總統
而是"選舉人"  也就各州的"投票代表"
而選舉委員會和州長認證的  也是各州的選舉人名單
選舉人需在大選后去華盛頓參加選舉人會議
跟其他州的代表一起  再投一次票  那一次才算真正選出總統

846
00:50:38,680 --> 00:51:38,680
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}當然大選夜之后的選舉人再度投票  只是象征性的
不過美國只有29個州有法律規定  選舉人在華盛頓開選舉人會時
必須根據本州的選舉結果投票  所以會出現個別不忠誠的選舉人
在最后投票時  選擇跟本州選民選舉結果不同的候選人
另外在1876年大選出現選派選舉人時產生爭議的情況后
1877年國會立法  規定如果各州的選舉人人選有爭議
則由國會來決定該州的選舉人  另外這個法律還規定
各州必須在選舉人會議前6天向國會提交選舉認證結果
在選舉夜  媒體根據自己的模型判斷勝負
但在法律上  必須所有的票都統計結束
由負責選舉的官員進行公證后  結果才正式生效
