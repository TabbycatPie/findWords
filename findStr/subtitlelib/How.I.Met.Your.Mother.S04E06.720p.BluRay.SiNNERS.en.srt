1
00:00:02,291 --> 00:00:03,781
<i>Kids,
the day you get married</i>

2
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:06,190
<i>is supposed to be
the happiest day of your life.</i>

3
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:09,094
<i>The perfect ending to a perfect love story.</i>

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,760
<i>My wedding, at least my first wedding,
didn't go so well.</i>

5
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:17,601
<i>Say that I'm changed</i>

6
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,505
<i>Say I'm different</i>

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,808
<i>Maybe I finally understand</i>

8
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:26,282
<i>Say I've let go</i>

9
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:32,154
It's funny, looking back on it now.
I was so sure Stella was the one.

10
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:35,488
And when she left me,
I was so devastated.

11
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:39,759
But you guys got me through it.
And now the painful part's over.

12
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:43,233
I've come out the other side
a little bit stronger.

13
00:00:43,336 --> 00:00:46,795
You know, I hardly
even think about her anymore.

14
00:00:46,907 --> 00:00:49,205
That's what time does, I guess.

15
00:00:52,212 --> 00:00:56,582
Ted, the wedding was yesterday.
It's been 24 hours.

16
00:00:56,684 --> 00:01:00,051
I know. And this is me moving on.

17
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:03,716
A great new chapter of my life
began today, and we're gonna celebrate.

18
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:08,422
Right now, we need two things.
We need Kool and we need the Gang.

19
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:10,362
It's jukebox time, huh?

20
00:01:14,738 --> 00:01:16,069
I look at that young man

21
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:19,472
popping and locking his way
over to the jukebox

22
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:24,036
and I think to myself, "You know,
maybe Stella made the right call. "

23
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:25,983
Ow! Pain.

24
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,914
What? How is he dancing right now?

25
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:31,614
He should be smashing up Stella's car
with a sledgehammer.

26
00:01:32,089 --> 00:01:35,753
Hypothetical.
Ted isn't pretending to be happy.

27
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:39,228
Ted really is happy. He never wanted
to get married in the first place.

28
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,894
<i>Ted just pulled off the greatest
train dodge since Stand by Me.</i>

29
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,904
Well, not the first kid, but the other kids.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,200
No, he is in bad shape.

31
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,375
What's up?

32
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,543
Really bad shape.
And we need to be there for him.

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,712
<i>But as much as my friends
really wanted to be there for me,</i>

34
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,552
<i>I was, by all appearances, fine.</i>

35
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,853
- Hey, buddy.
- Want to hang out?

36
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:08,156
Guys, I'm fine.

37
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:13,193
- Hey, pal, you want to have a catch?
- I'm fine.

38
00:02:16,973 --> 00:02:20,636
- Hey, kiddo.
- Barney, I'm fine.

39
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:24,271
This is not necessary,
and it's actually kind of weird.

40
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:28,340
- No offense, ladies.
- I did not realize you'd be home.

41
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:30,913
Ladies, to the stairwell.

42
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:48,335
<i>Finally, after two weeks,
the inevitable emotions boiled over.</i>

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,433
- Hey, you guys want to get some dinner?
- Oh, shut up.

44
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:53,545
I'm sorry, sweetie.

45
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:56,775
It's just, Ted, you've been through
something traumatic,

46
00:02:56,883 --> 00:03:00,284
and we're trying to be there for you
as friends, but you're not letting us,

47
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:04,791
and it's pissing us off,
you selfish bitch. Sorry.

48
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,656
Look, we're just worried that you're not
dealing with this whole Stella thing.

49
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,730
Okay, now, do you remember
when Lily left me?

50
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,731
You remember how I held in my feelings?

51
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:16,898
I miss her so much.

52
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:20,734
Yeah, dude, you were a rock.

53
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:23,778
Well, I should have been even worse,
okay? I should have gotten mad.

54
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,508
I should have taken your advice
and set all of Lily's stuff on fire.

55
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,481
Oh. Nice. Thanks, Ted.

56
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:31,619
But I didn't, and I think that that's why
it took me so long to get better.

57
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:35,453
So, now, Ted, I want you to explode.

58
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:38,494
Release the berserker. Okay, you ready?

59
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:41,756
Now!

60
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:44,264
- I'm good.
No.

61
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:46,860
Guys, get off his back. He's happy.

62
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,941
Listen, if Ted were married right now,

63
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:52,238
he'd be married,
he'd be living in New Jersey,

64
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:55,405
and he'd be married.

65
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:58,382
He's fine. Now, let's eat.
How about Flat Michael's?

66
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,282
No, that's 44th and Lex. Can't do it.

67
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,082
- Why not?
- It's too close to Stella's gym.

68
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:04,248
Might run into her. Anywhere else, though.

69
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:05,882
Okay, how about Hurley's?

70
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:10,622
Right between Stella's office
and her dry cleaners. No, sir.

71
00:04:10,732 --> 00:04:12,700
Well, what about Meatloaf Charlie's?

72
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,995
Two blocks
from Stella's mother's hairdressers.

73
00:04:15,103 --> 00:04:18,437
Well, jeez, Ted, is there anywhere
in Manhattan we can go to dinner?

74
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,169
Of course. Check this out.

75
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:27,278
- What you got there, Ted?
- A little reference map I made for myself.

76
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:30,478
A New York guide to places
you might run into Stella Zinman.

77
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:34,921
Red areas are places to avoid.
White areas are safe. Blue is water.

78
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,359
- That is just ridiculous.
- Well, water is blue.

79
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:40,154
You can't live that way.

80
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:42,858
She leaves you at the altar
and you're the one avoiding her?

81
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:44,491
Yes, I'm avoiding her.

82
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:46,366
What's the big deal? That's how we do it.

83
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:48,063
Who's "we"? Gutless weenies?

84
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:52,405
No, "we" is people
from the great state of Ohio.

85
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:56,881
When life gives us pain, we Buckeyes
take that pain and we push it down.

86
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,286
And if the pain starts to come up again,
we push more pain down on top of it.

87
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:03,685
Why confront something
when you can avoid it, right?

88
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,421
All I have to do is never see Stella again,
and I'll live a long, happy life.

89
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:09,789
Now, who wants to get something to eat?

90
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:13,458
Oh. Somebody just told me about
a tapas place that's in the white zone.

91
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,160
Great. Let's go there.

92
00:05:16,905 --> 00:05:18,873
- You ready to order?
- Not quite yet.

93
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:21,100
Can we get some of
those almonds for the table?

94
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:22,506
Certainly.

95
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:25,572
Nice call, Lily. This place looks great.

96
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:28,946
- Who told you about it?
- You know, I don't remember.

97
00:05:30,352 --> 00:05:31,319
Uh-oh.

98
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:34,321
- What?
- I just remembered.

99
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,393
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Okay, okay, just be cool.

100
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:51,999
We're just gonna have to deal with this.
Everyone, follow my lead.

101
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,742
- Oh, you're kidding.
- Is he serious?

102
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:01,684
I am not getting under this table.
I'd maybe get under that table.

103
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:04,288
She's turning around.

104
00:06:09,496 --> 00:06:11,361
Think, think, think.

105
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:14,298
Everyone, just stay here.
I'm gonna go take a look.

106
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:16,369
Marshall, go take a look.

107
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:26,442
- And will you need utensils?
- No, I'm just going straight home.

108
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:29,910
She's placing an order to go.

109
00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:32,180
Did she seem happy?
Did she say anything about me?

110
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:35,121
I don't care. I don't even care.
Where are those almonds?

111
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:36,714
Gosh, where would Ted's nuts be?

112
00:06:36,826 --> 00:06:40,057
Hey, why don't you check
the vise in Stella's garage?

113
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,187
Go yell at her.

114
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:44,392
Ted, you may be from Ohio,
but you live in New York now.

115
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:46,560
We don't push down
our feelings in New York.

116
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,662
We take our feelings and
we shove them in somebody else's face!

117
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,070
Spare me, Lily.

118
00:06:51,175 --> 00:06:53,201
You'd be doing the same thing
if you were in this situation.

119
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:54,335
That's outrageous.

120
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:58,006
There is not a person on Earth
I would hide under a table from.

121
00:06:58,116 --> 00:07:02,952
Really, not a single person?
Not even Gasser?

122
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:07,349
- How dare you mention that name to me.
- Who's Gasser?

123
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,896
He's the last person I'd want to see
walk through that door.

124
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,125
Michael Sasser.
He's a guy I went to high school with.

125
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,464
<i>Michael sat next to me
in freshman biology.</i>

126
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,233
<i>He had been a bit of a loser
all through middle school.</i>

127
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:21,933
<i>But the summer before ninth grade,</i>

128
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:24,807
<i>he grew 12 inches
and joined the baseball team.</i>

129
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:28,313
<i>He was right on the precipice
of becoming one of the cool kids.</i>

130
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,747
<i>Until one day...</i>

131
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:36,583
Lily, we've all been there.
When you've ripped one, it's not pretty.

132
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:37,989
What did you do?

133
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:43,054
Are you kidding? This was ninth grade.
I only had one choice.

134
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,865
Oh, my God, Sasser. Fart much?

135
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:51,974
- No, it wasn't me. It was her.
- Oh! As if, Sasser.

136
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:53,734
More like Gasser.

137
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:56,973
- Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!
- Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!

138
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,343
- No.
- Gasser! Gasser! Gasser! Gasser!

139
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,476
I'm on the baseball team. I'm cool.

140
00:08:01,586 --> 00:08:02,746
Gasser! Gasser!

141
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:05,280
The nickname Gasser stuck.

142
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,325
He got teased so much,
eventually he had to change schools.

143
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:12,830
- Kids are awesome.
- I've always felt awful about that.

144
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:17,096
But if Gasser... Michael
walked in right now,

145
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:20,696
as hard as it would be,
I would go up to Gasser... Michael

146
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,502
and I would resolve things between us.

147
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:24,804
Right, clear the air, as it were.

148
00:08:24,912 --> 00:08:26,607
Oh, man.

149
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:30,206
Those don't come around often.
Y'all are welcome.

150
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,082
- Hey, are you guys okay?
- Oh. Yeah.

151
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,712
We're just gonna be eating down here
if that's okay.

152
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:37,451
- What?
- Well, here's your almonds.

153
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,526
Oh. Thanks.

154
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:41,687
- You guys have any specials tonight?
- Ted, this is ludicrous.

155
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:45,062
Ted, I am a person who...
Well, let's just face it.

156
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:47,363
There are a lot of people
I don't want to see,

157
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,098
people of the chicks-I-banged persuasion.

158
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:52,731
But if any of them were to walk in here,
I would stand up

159
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:57,212
and I would look them right in the eye.
Some of them for the very first time.

160
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:59,713
Really, you wouldn't hide from anyone?

161
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:00,806
Uh-uh.

162
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:05,946
- Not even, say, Becca DeLucci?
- You son of a bitch.

163
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:09,184
- Who's Becca DeLucci?
- Do you mind?

164
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:14,397
So, who is Becca DeLucci?

165
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:17,901
Becca is just this girl who lives upstate.
I used to visit her now and again.

166
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,939
Mmm-hmm.
Where exactly upstate, Barney?

167
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:24,175
Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.

168
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:28,408
<i>And yes, the visits
were of a conjugal nature.</i>

169
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:32,813
- No. No way, really?
- Really.

170
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,220
And what I had with Becca
was a perfect relationship.

171
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:39,987
She was only allowed, by law,
to call me once a week.

172
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,428
If she ever got clingy,
the armed guards stopped her.

173
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:47,434
And I never had to pay for dinner.
Well, that's not true. I pay taxes.

174
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,902
Then again, I guess we all paid for dinner.
Thanks a lot, guys.

175
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,806
Anyway, the last time I visited,
I kind of screwed things up.

176
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:58,947
I know it's hard, baby,
but I'm in a prison, too.

177
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,017
A prison of my own heart.

178
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:05,253
Is that room ready yet or what?
Can we... Tick-tock.

179
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:09,051
Barney, you're the only thing
that's keeping me going here.

180
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,288
That's what I'm here for, baby.
I'm your rock.

181
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,899
I'm... Oh, my God. Hello, strange.

182
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:23,633
Hi, Barney Stinson, attorney at law.
Let's talk about getting you off.

183
00:10:23,743 --> 00:10:25,176
Oh, hell, no!

184
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,247
Whoa!

185
00:10:31,217 --> 00:10:32,309
Ooh.

186
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:39,883
Now I get letters from Becca and she's all,

187
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:42,326
"I'm coming to get you
the day I get out of here.

188
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,662
"I'm gonna hang your eyes
from my rearview mirror. "

189
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:47,457
Women, huh?

190
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,968
See? You're scared of Becca.
Lily's scared of Gasser.

191
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:54,270
We're staying under the table.

192
00:10:56,913 --> 00:11:00,405
- We don't have to. Stella's gone.
- Oh, my gosh.

193
00:11:02,319 --> 00:11:07,848
There, all done,
and that's how we do it Ohio-style.

194
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,324
Problem showed up. We avoided it.
It went away.

195
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:11,952
Now we can enjoy our meal in peace...

196
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:13,030
She's back.

197
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:22,268
Ted, we all think that you need...
Wait, where's Barney?

198
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,112
Ted, we all think
that you need to go talk to her.

199
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:32,242
- I don't.
- What?

200
00:11:32,352 --> 00:11:34,479
Yeah, if the last person I wanted to see
walked through the door,

201
00:11:34,588 --> 00:11:35,748
I wouldn't say a damn word.

202
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:37,414
- Really?
- And who's that?

203
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:38,855
My father.

204
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:42,395
You guys, that other table is off the hook.

205
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,294
- What are we talking about?
- Robin's dad.

206
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,695
I haven't spoken to him in three years

207
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,893
- and I don't intend to start now.
- Why?

208
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:50,695
<i>It goes back
to the day I was born.</i>

209
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:52,967
You give me my son now. Push.

210
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,977
Oh, no.

211
00:11:57,746 --> 00:11:58,906
Oh, no.

212
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:02,815
He wanted a son and the fact
that I was a girl didn't change his plan.

213
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,682
What do you mean?

214
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:08,154
My full legal name is
Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr.

215
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:11,283
And it only gets worse from there.

216
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:15,024
<i>When I was eight,
he took me hunting for the first time.</i>

217
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:18,295
- I don't want to shoot a deer.
- Nonsense, R.J.

218
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:22,601
- Shooting deer is the noblest of pursuits.
- But they're cute.

219
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:27,474
You said the same thing about our rabbits.
Remember how delicious they were?

220
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:31,681
- Over the years, as my body developed...
- Hold on a sec.

221
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,251
Sorry, go on.

222
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,149
It became harder and harder for him
to pretend I was a boy.

223
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:40,920
<i>The lowest moment came
when I turned 14.</i>

224
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,690
<i>My peewee hockey team
had just won the Squamish invitational</i>

225
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,765
<i>and everyone came back
to my house to celebrate.</i>

226
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:49,530
You lads availed yourself splendidly
out there on the ice.

227
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:52,435
Splendidly. You go on outside.

228
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,909
I'll come back with an assortment
of soft drinks and American pretzels.

229
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:02,580
Hey, I can't believe you missed
that last empty-netter, you hoser.

230
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:05,677
- You're the hoser.
- No, you're the hoser.

231
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,691
What are you doing?

232
00:13:15,298 --> 00:13:18,234
You're teammates, hockey players.

233
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:24,004
Teammates don't kiss!
Hockey players don't kiss!

234
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:27,576
Oh, my God.

235
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:30,281
I have no son.

236
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:36,118
You poor thing.

237
00:13:36,222 --> 00:13:40,682
To have to grow up in Canada
with America right there.

238
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:46,130
That sucks about your dad, Robin,
but congratulations on that game.

239
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:49,732
And Kyle and I
weren't even doing anything serious.

240
00:13:49,837 --> 00:13:52,328
- We only went to the blue line.
- The blue line?

241
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:55,432
Yeah, you know how when you're a kid,
you put everything into hockey terms?

242
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,738
The blue line is kissing,
the red line is getting naked,

243
00:13:57,846 --> 00:14:01,077
and I think "in the crease"
speaks for itself.

244
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:04,812
Anyway, after that, my relationship
with my dad pretty much went north.

245
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,150
I moved in with my mom,
grew my hair out,

246
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:10,817
became a Canadian pop star.
You know, normal teen stuff.

247
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:14,089
Don't you think it would feel better
to talk to him about all this?

248
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:17,132
No, that's the point.
It wouldn't solve anything.

249
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:21,364
It's in the past. It's done.
I mean, what would I even say to him?

250
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,405
"I wish you hadn't raised me as a boy?

251
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:25,874
"I wish you hadn't taught me how to hunt

252
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:28,309
"and fish and smoke cigars
and drink Scotch

253
00:14:28,413 --> 00:14:30,210
"because that's not what girls do.

254
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:32,112
"And you know,
the reason I throw like a girl, Dad,

255
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:34,151
"is because I am a girl. "

256
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:40,221
You've held on to that
for a long time, huh?

257
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:41,384
Yeah.

258
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,062
It really messed you up.

259
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:45,920
Yeah.

260
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:47,056
- That sucks.
- I'm sorry.

261
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,498
That's hot.

262
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,800
<i>And then I realized...</i>

263
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:56,373
<i>All of my friends were haunted,</i>

264
00:14:56,477 --> 00:14:59,878
<i>but there was a difference
between my ghost and theirs.</i>

265
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,971
<i>It wasn't too late for me.</i>

266
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,144
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- All right, bud.

267
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:14,419
- She's gone. I'm going after her.
- Go, go.

268
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:19,296
There she goes! Taxi!

269
00:15:25,476 --> 00:15:27,034
Okay, I see her.
She's two cabs ahead on the right.

270
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,372
Just stay with her, okay?

271
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:31,643
Finally. Finally, you're doing this.
You're gonna confront her.

272
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,809
- Yes, I am gonna confront her.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:35,351
- This is so exciting.
- Totally.

274
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:36,477
What are you going to say?

275
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:40,958
I'm gonna say, "Stella,
I'm sorry things didn't work out. "

276
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,153
- No!
- Yes.

277
00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:44,889
We're going to talk about this like adults.

278
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:48,763
She can tell me her side
and I'm going to listen.

279
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:50,803
Probably should have done
a little more of that before.

280
00:15:50,904 --> 00:15:52,565
Driver, can you run us
into the nearest lamppost?

281
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:54,264
Everyone, buckle up. Not you, Ted.

282
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:59,368
Ted, Ted, you gotta get mad right now.
Come on. Dig deep.

283
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:01,505
Dude, come on.
This isn't about me waving my arms,

284
00:16:01,616 --> 00:16:03,243
stamping my feet, and getting really mad.

285
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:06,149
This is about Stella and I
finally communicating.

286
00:16:06,254 --> 00:16:09,087
<i>- I mean, clearly, that was...
- Stella hated Star Wars.</i>

287
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,453
She lied to you.

288
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,323
Search your feelings, Ted.
You know it to be true.

289
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:18,692
- Well, that's her business.
- Come on, Ted. She left you at the altar.

290
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:21,769
- I don't understand!
- Ted, in the name of all that is sacred...

291
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:23,304
Wait, wait, wait!

292
00:16:23,406 --> 00:16:26,170
Where is she going? Her cab just missed
the turn for the Lincoln Tunnel.

293
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:27,868
Why would anybody buy takeout food

294
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:30,071
and bring it all the way back
to New Jersey anyway?

295
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:32,741
- Maybe she's going to her office.
- No.

296
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:35,647
<i>The waiter asked her,
"And will you need utensils?"</i>

297
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:37,744
<i>And then she said,
"No, I'm just going straight home. "</i>

298
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:41,350
But if she's going home,
why are we still heading...

299
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,791
Oh, my God.

300
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:48,665
Tony lives downtown.
Home is Tony's apartment.

301
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:51,328
She was gonna make me
move to New Jersey,

302
00:16:51,437 --> 00:16:54,406
and then she moves into the city
with Tony?

303
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:59,037
- Son of a bitch!
- Finally. Finally, buddy.

304
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:02,013
- I am so angry right now!
- I know, and I love it!

305
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:05,880
Yeah, that is awesome!

306
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:09,445
Sir, we'd be happy to cover
the cost of that window crank.

307
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,287
- I love angry Ted!
- So do I!

308
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:17,288
- Let it out, baby. Let it out.
- She's stopping.

309
00:17:17,399 --> 00:17:20,300
- It is on. It is on!
- Yes, Ted.

310
00:17:20,402 --> 00:17:22,996
- Go get her, buddy!
- Go get rid of your demons!

311
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:24,163
My leg is asleep!

312
00:17:24,273 --> 00:17:26,673
- Okay, wait, wait, wait. Wait, hold on.
- Lily, what are you doing?

313
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:29,074
No, no, no. This is all right, hold on.

314
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,546
Look, Ted, it's great
that you're angry right now...

315
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:34,674
- It sure is.
- Yes.

316
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:39,085
And that you're finally dealing with this,
but you only get one shot here.

317
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,786
Let's just take a beat
and think about what you're gonna say.

318
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:47,332
I know exactly what I'm gonna say.
Yeah.

319
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,577
You picked the wrong guy.

320
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,570
Ted.

321
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,482
You picked the wrong guy.

322
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:10,213
You made a really, really,
really bad choice.

323
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:16,729
What were you thinking? That guy?
Are you kidding me?

324
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,959
Have you learned nothing
in the last eight years?

325
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:22,161
You're just gonna regret this.
You know that, right?

326
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,897
You are going to regret this,

327
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:25,701
and now
there is nothing you can do about it

328
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:27,639
because it's too late.

329
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:33,938
All you can do now is go up there
and start your crappy, disappointing life

330
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,545
that will never be nearly as happy
as the one you could have had with me.

331
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:41,154
Goodbye.

332
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:42,623
- Ted, wait.
- Look, Stella,

333
00:18:42,726 --> 00:18:45,457
I am not here to win you back.

334
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:48,828
I am here because I need to know
that you know

335
00:18:50,068 --> 00:18:53,903
- you made the biggest mistake of your life.
- I know.

336
00:18:57,743 --> 00:18:58,801
Good.

337
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,408
That's what I'm gonna say.

338
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:06,414
- Cold-blooded.
- Yeah, that's good.

339
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,884
Go say that.

340
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,016
Thanks.

341
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:15,327
<i>So I got out of the cab,
ready to say all of that stuff,</i>

342
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:17,795
<i>ready to explode, but then...</i>

343
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,025
- Mommy!
Hey.

344
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,860
Hi, sweetie.
Me first. Me first.

345
00:19:24,072 --> 00:19:25,937
<i>It all just went away.</i>

346
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:34,014
<i>And that was it.
In that moment, I wasn't angry anymore.</i>

347
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:37,842
<i>I could see Stella
was meant to be with Tony.</i>

348
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:41,653
<i>Kids, you may think your only choices
are to swallow your anger</i>

349
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,852
<i>or throw it in someone's face.</i>

350
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:47,556
<i>But there's a third option,
you can just let it go.</i>

351
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:49,496
<i>And only when you do that
is it really gone,</i>

352
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,466
<i>and you can move forward.</i>

353
00:19:51,569 --> 00:19:55,835
<i>And that, kids, was the perfect ending
to a perfect love story.</i>

354
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,707
<i>It just wasn't mine.
Mine was still out there waiting for me.</i>
