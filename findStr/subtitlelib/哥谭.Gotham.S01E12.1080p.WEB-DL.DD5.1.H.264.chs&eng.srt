2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,960
但愿那老家伙法尔科内能出点意外
I wish something would happen to old man Falcone.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,250
到时谁来接手呢
who would take over then?

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,270
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

5
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,580
马罗尼和军械库的抢劫无关
Maroni had nothing to do with the armory job.

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,180
显然  您这儿有个内奸
You have a mole, obviously.

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,220
某个和您很亲近的人
Someone close to you.

去给疯子做保安

10
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,640

Criminal nut-jobs, yeah.

因强奸杀人进了阿卡姆
In Arkham off a rape/murder beef.

39
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,030
我们找不到格鲁伯
We can't find any records on Gruber

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,100
入狱前的记录
prior to his incarceration,

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,090
所以我们认为这是化名
so we're guessing Gruber is an alias.

42
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,600
我们已经在全国范围搜索他的指纹
We're sending his prints nationwide,

43
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,640
希望能找到他的真实身份
see if we can find another name for him.

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,860
不管他是谁  他聪明  愤怒

45
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,470
且严重威胁公众

局长非常关心此事

47
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,610

你们都清楚这意味着什么

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,020
要知道
And you know...

51
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,660

52
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,060

警监  这是我的案子

56
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,540
吉姆  你马上给我离开这里

57
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,520
-这是我的案子  -不不不
- It's my case. - No, no, no.

58
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,730
警监说的对
The captain is right.

59
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,520
你得在局长到之前离开这里
You need to leave before the commissioner gets here.

60
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,260
为什么
Why?

61
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,150
因为他会把这些都算在你头上
Because he holds you responsible for all of this,

62
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,940
而且  倒霉  他已经到了
and... oh, fudge. He's here.

63
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,330
你要被他看到了  躲一下

00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,940
是戈登警卫吧
Officer Gordon, isn't it?

67
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,610
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,940
你为什么在这儿
Why are you here?

69
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,450
我有个更好的问题
I have a better question.

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,260
你为什么在这儿  局长
Why are you here, Commissioner?

71
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,560
-你说什么  -这是我第一次
- Excuse me? - This is the first

72
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,050
见你来到基层

73
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,950
你一定很心急吧

74
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,190
跟我走

我恨你

78
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,750
我恨你
I hate you.

79
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,090
不是我想那么干的  是你朋友
It wasn't my idea; it was your friend.

80
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,940
是他提出背叛你
He came up with the double-cross,

81
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,200
还逼我合作
made me go along.

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,340
但你自己也会思考的  不是吗
You have a mind of your own, don't you?

83
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,280
拜托
Hey, come on.

84
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,190

我不用

91

听从任何人的命令
have to do anything.

92
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,370
我是自由的

93
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,170
你知道讽刺的是什么吗
You know the funny thing?

94
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,160
我想是在阿卡姆度过的日子让我找到了自由

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,200
我是说
I mean,

96
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,860
思想的自由
in here.

97
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,830
现在我终于认清了世界
Now I see the world for what it really is.

98
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,810
一座满是破损机器的废弃工厂
An abandoned factory full of broken machines.

99
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,010
其中一些
Some--

100
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,150
不过少之又少
very few--

101
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,070
是可以修好的
can be fixed.

102
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,120
大部分
Most...

103
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,900
只能报废了

104
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,990
丹泽  把住他
Danzig, hold him, please.

105
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,370
求你了

107
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,140
求你了  求求你
Please! Please!

108
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,910
两个疯子逃之夭夭
Two maniacs on the loose

109
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,750
也给整个阿卡姆项目蒙羞了  不是吗
makes the whole Arkham Project look kind of shady, huh?

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,930
投资人一定坐不住了吧
The moneymen want results fast, I bet.

111
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,360
你居然还敢这样自以为是
You're strangely self-righteous,

112
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,290
病人逃走难道不是你的责任吗
given that it was you that let these men escape.

113
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,890
让我背黑锅无所谓  反正我已经声名狼藉了
Blame me all you want. My name's already mud.

114
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,710
但那两人还在逃
Those two will still be out there,

115
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,700

117

你父亲是个地检官
Your father was the district attorney.

118
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,070
多好的职位  最适合有身份的人
A proud station for a man of substance.

119
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,060
下一代难道不该受其激励  也以法律为职吗
You would think that would inspire a son to practice law.

120
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,700
我就是在执行法律
I'm enforcing the law.

121
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,660
你是想继续说我爸呢
You want to talk about my dad

122
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,090
还是想抓住格鲁伯和丹泽
or do you want to catch Gruber and Danzig?

123
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,170
你心里那股叛逆的怒火是哪来的
Where do you get the rebellious fire in your belly?

124
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,580
我能不能插个嘴
Can I take this opportunity to say

125
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,230
我不叛逆  也不愤怒  一点没有
that I have no rebellious fire here, nada.

126
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,700
杰克・格鲁伯还在逃
Jack Gruber is out there,

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,650
图谋不轨
planning a catastrophe.

128
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,630
我了解这个人
I know the man.

129
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,970
我知道他在想什么
I know how he thinks.

130
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,940
我知道他下一步会干什么
I know what he'll do next.

131
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,810
是什么
Which is what?

132
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,650
现在还不能说
That I'll keep to myself.

133
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,050
我保证会将这两人捉拿归案
I guarantee I'll bring in these two men,

134
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,170
但首先  你得复我的职
but first, I need you to reinstate me

135
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,540
让我重新成为哥谭市警局的一级警探
as detective first grade in the GCPD.

136
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,400
你这是勒索  戈登警员
Extortion, Officer Gordon.

137
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,410
给你一天时间
24 hours?

138
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:05,260
-什么  -你们有一天时间去抓这两个人
- What? - You've got 24 hours to bring these men in.

139
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,300
如果没抓到  你们两个下半辈子
You don't, you can both spend the rest

140
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,650
就给我待在阿卡姆吧
of your miserable careers down at Arkham.

141
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,310
就这样  二位警探
That will be all, Detectives.

142
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,620
什么情况
What the hell just happened?

143
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,940
没事的  没事
It's okay, it's okay.

144
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,260
-不会有事的  哈维  -是吗
- Everything's gonna be fine, Harvey. - Yeah?

145
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,830
当然  只要抓到那两个坏蛋就好了
Yeah, we just got to catch the bad guys.

146
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,850
-行啊  上哪去抓  -不知道
- Okay, where are we going? - I don't know.

147
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,760
什么  你刚不是还说知道格鲁伯下一步计划吗
What? You just told him you knew what Gruber was gonna do next.

148
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,700
我骗人的
I lied.

149
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,670
哥谭

150
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,510
求你了  法尔科内阁下  饶了我吧
Please, Don Falcone, have mercy.

151
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,790

你还这么年轻
A young man like you,

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,350
死了太不公平了
it doesn't seem fair.

156
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,770
求求你
Please.

157
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,750
法尔科内阁下  求求你了
Don Falcone, please!

158
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,250
小时候  这片都是贫民窟
This whole area used to be slums when I was a boy.

159
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,380
您真不容易
You've come a long way.

160
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,180
您的一些手下在找您呢
Some of your people are looking for you, you know.

161
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,680
但我只想见你
But you're the one I wanted to see.

162
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,560
我奋斗了这么久才取得今天的成就
I've worked so long all my life to get where I am.

163
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,690
久到我已经忘了当初为什么要奋斗
So long, I forget why I wanted to be here.

164
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,440
您想要成为大人物
Well, you wanted to be someone.

165
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,400
现在您已经是了
And you are.

166
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,350
瞧瞧您拥有的这些啊
Look at all the stuff you have.

167
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,380
你是个好姑娘  莉莎
You're a good girl, Liza.

168
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,110
你应该找一个年轻人  和他结婚生子
You need to find a young man and get married, have babies.

169
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,290
把你留在我身边  困在这里打理家务
It's not fair of me, keeping you cooped up here,

170
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,860
实在太自私了
doing my housework.

171
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,580
你在这里是找不到好丈夫的
You'll never find a good husband here.

172
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,060
如果你想要出去闯闯
Anyhow, if you'd like to get out in the world,

173
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,760
我可以送你一个面包店
I was thinking I could set you up with a bakery

174
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,440
或者别的小店
or some type of business like that.

175
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,710
这样你就可以独立生活了
So you can be independent.

176
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,030
您真好  法先生  谢谢
That's really nice, Mr. F. Thank you.

177
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,530
但我更想和您在一起
But I would rather be here with you.

178
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,340
真的吗
You would?

179
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,940
我很喜欢这里
I like it here.

180
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,280
您让我觉得很安全
You make me feel safe.

181
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,430
好
Well, good.

182
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,990
我也喜欢你陪在身边
I like having you here.

183
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,680
好吧
Yeah.

184
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,040
晚餐前我还有点事要办
Maybe I'll try to get a little work done before dinner.

185
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,780
今晚我要做顿丰盛晚餐
I'm making something special tonight.

186
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,440
你笑什么
What are you laughing at?

187
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,120
回来真好
Ah, it's good to be back.

188
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,780
只有疯人院回来的人才会这么说
Only a man from a lunatic asylum would say that.

189
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,040
你就像个人类过山车
You're like a human roller coaster,

190
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,720
只是你只往低处走
except you only go down.

191
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,090
那他不是更像电梯吗
Wouldn't that make him more of an elevator?

192
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,500
有什么有用的消息吗  爱德
You have anything useful, Ed?

193
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,160
还有不到20小时我就要失业了
I got a little less than 20 hours before I lose my job.

194
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,060
我确实  有点有用的消息
I do -- have something useful.

195
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,000
是什么
And it is?

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,740
我交叉对比了指纹
I cross-checked fingerprints.

197
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,950
阿卡姆的精神病人杰克・格鲁伯
The clinically insane Jack Gruber of Arkham

198
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,210
只是文件上的虚假身份
is a figment of the files.

199
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,000
他本人实际上是个职业罪犯
The man himself is really a career criminal

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,110
叫做杰克・布钦斯基
by the name Jack Buchinsky.

201
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,280
这怎么可能啊
How is that even possible?

202
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,320
收买个人改份文件记录是很容易的
Easy enough to bribe someone to change the records.

203
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,840
是  看来他很想转去阿卡姆
Yep, apparently, he wanted to be transferred to Arkham.

204
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,950
干的真棒  爱德
That's really good work, Ed.

205
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,670
这布闲斯基又是谁啊
What's this Buttinsky's deal?

206
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,510
是布钦斯基
Uh, it's, uh, Buchinsky.

207
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,570
他的事都在文件里
It's all in the files.

208
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,370
带出去时要签名
Just make sure you sign it out.

209
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,150
这是机密信息  要谨慎处理
It's classified information, so just be careful.

210
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,970
柯林格小姐
Miss Kringle?

211
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,430
我想这个是你落在我桌上的
I believe you left this on my desk.

212
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,440
这是个谜语
It's a riddle.

213
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,570
这是个露着截子弹的纸杯蛋糕
It's a cupcake with a live bullet sticking out of it.

214
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,830
这是个谜语
It's a riddle.

215
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:29,910
这恐怖  古怪  而且不宜食用
It's menacing and weird and inedible.

216
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,930
谢谢你的文件  柯林格小姐
Thank you for the files, Miss Kringle.

217
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,530
这个布钦斯基和他的同伙
This Buchinsky dude and his partners

218
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,200
四次成功抢劫银行
pulled four successful bank robberies,

219
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,480
被哥谭市警局意外抓获前还杀过
killed six along the way before the GCPD caught him

220
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,530
六个人
by accident.

221
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,830
他一直未供出同伙的名字
He never named his accomplices.

222
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,890
他在监狱里时
He's in prison,

223
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,480
听说阿卡姆重新开门了
he hears Arkham is opening its doors,

224
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
于是动用了点关系
so he uses his connections,

225
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,520
给自己弄了个新身份
and he gets himself a new identity

226
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,630
就是精神病人格鲁伯
as the mental patient Gruber.

227
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,040
他找的关系肯定挺厉害
He must have some good connections.

228
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,240
没错  其他疯子也被送进阿卡姆后
Right, and when the rest of the nuts get transferred to Arkham --

229
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,150
好戏就上演了
voila.

230
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,550
他当时有同伙
So, he had partners, huh?

231
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,380
哥谭市警局还不知道是谁
Yeah, GCPD never identified them.

232
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,500
他们还在逍遥法外
They're still out there.

233
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,950
是的  找到他们  就能找到他
Yep, we find them, we'll find him.

234
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,140
很简单吧
Easy enough, huh?

235
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,190
警探
Detective.

236
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,890
{\an8}被劫货车被弃于工业园区

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,930
线索来了
A hit.

238
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,200
阿卡姆疯人院犯人运送车辆

239
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,240
有什么发现
What do we got?

240
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,770
警员撒粉提取了指纹  找到两个人的
Lead detectives dusted for prints, two sets--

241
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,470
格鲁伯和丹泽的  跟我们想的一样
Gruber and Danzig, just like we thought.

242
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,420
好  谢谢  好吧
Right. Thanks. All right.

243
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,010
货车没错了  是他们
Van checks out. It was them.

244
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,810
这人对用电作案很着迷是吧
Our man's an electronics freak, right?

245
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:33,570
没错
Yeah.

246
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,140
觉得他会不会是去买东西了
Think he went shopping?

247
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,580
欧文电子

248
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,780
死了  电的外焦里嫩的
He's dead. Fried like a doughnut.

249
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,060
哥谭市警局
GCPD.

250
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,900
转过身  把手举起来
Turn around slowly, let me see those hands.

251
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,380
伙计
Hey, buddy.

252
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:32,780
我不背叛朋友

253
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,430
救命  救命啊
Help, help! Please!

254
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,060
滚回去
Get back in the store.

255
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,850
好啦  没事
Okay. Take it easy. Okay.

256
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,440
求求你  这一定是个误会
Please, there's been a terrible mistake.

257
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,460
我只是法尔科内阁下的管家
I am Don Falcone's housekeeper.

258
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,040
菲什  谢天谢地
Fish? Thank God.

259
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,810
你干吗那样把我拉来
Why'd you have to pull me out like that?

260
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,110
你吓死我了
You scared the life out of me.

261
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,340
是时候了  莉莎
It's time, Liza.

262
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,110
我要对法尔科内下手了
I'm gonna make my move on Falcone.

263
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,000
别害怕  小姑娘
And don't be scared, baby girl.

264
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,760
有我呢
I got this.

265
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,250
法尔科内先生  你女人莉莎在我这儿
Mr. Falcone, we have your girl, Liza.

266

你还想再见她吗
Would you like to see her again?

267
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,780
当然  我想
Yes, I would.

268
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,330
她听到一定会很高兴
She'll be glad to hear that.

269
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,510
这么健康的年轻姑娘  对疼痛的忍耐力真差
For a fit young woman, she has a low pain threshold.

270
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,750
求你了  住手  别打了
Please! No! Stop!

271
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,200
很快会有中间人联系你的
An intermediary will be in contact with you soon.

272
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,400
别伤害她  她只是个普通人
Don't hurt her. She's a civilian.

273
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,130
喂
Hello?

274
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,400
现在怎么办
What now?

275
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,910
让他坐着  思考一下人生
Now we let him sit and think about his life for a while.

276
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,660
{\an8}电刑人袭人

277
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,800
"电刑人"  真好听
"The Electrocutioner." cute.

278
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,950
别有压力
No pressure.

279
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,950
不用担心  一定能抓到他
Don't worry, we'll get him.

280
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,960
是啊  就剩17个小时了
Yeah, and we got 17 hours to do so.

281
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,030
这名字我喜欢
I love the name.

282
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,700
朗朗上口  有个性
It's catchy, has drama.

283
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,710
电  刑  人
The Electro-cutioner.

284
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,910
话说  根据他通常的袭击方式
Speaking of which, given the general mode of attack,

285
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,040
我建议两位...
may I suggest you both wear your...

286
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,940
外出办案时穿上警局配发的橡胶鞋
department-issue galoshes while you're out in the field.

287
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
橡胶鞋
Galoshes?

288
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,820
万一发生触电的意外事故
In the event of electrical misadventure,

289
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,550
你们的鞋子得绝缘才行
your footwear should be insulated.

290
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,860
不要啦  老妈  我才不穿橡胶鞋呢
No, Mom! I'm not gonna wear my rubbers on the case.

291
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,300
尼格玛  把鞋给我
Nygma, give 'em here.

292
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,930
不是吧
Seriously?

293
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,500
说说目前什么情况
All right, so what do we know?

294
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,280
格鲁伯对欧文很不满
Gruber wasn't too happy with Irwin.

295
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,520
也许他俩以前一起作案  欧文背叛了他
Maybe they were partners in crime, Irwin turned on him,

296
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,580
结果格鲁伯被抓
Gruber took the fall.

297
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,660
戈登警探
Detective Gordon.

298
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,320

恭喜  你又能回来工作了
Congratulations, you got your job back.

301
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,700

Or not, depending.

302
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,730
很高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

303
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,460
是吗
Is it?

304
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,970
我知道你正忙着抓逃犯
I-I know you're caught up with the escape.

305
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,720
我就是因为这个来的
That's why I'm here.

306
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
一切还好吧
Is everything okay?

307
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,440
一定都乱作一团了
Must be chaos down there.

308
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,420
我们还能撑住  谢谢关心
We're getting by just fine. Thanks for asking.

布洛克警探
Detective Bullock.

312
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,250
你手上拿的是什么
Who's your little friend there?

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,860
我就是为了这个来的
Oh, this is why I'm here.

314
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,220
我工作的囚区  有个女人是女巫
One of the women in my wing is a pagan sorceress.

315
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,030

病人们做娃娃  做成他们想要诅咒的人的样子
The inmates make dolls to look like people that they want to curse.

318
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,280
然后女巫替他们诅咒这些娃娃
And then they give it to the sorceress to curse them.

319
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,260
用苏打水和糖作为交换

320
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,540
我经常诅咒你  也没见你给我糖吃啊
I curse you all the time. You never give me candy.

321
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,080
我问她格鲁伯有没有给过她娃娃让她诅咒
I asked her if Gruber had ever given her a doll to curse,

322
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,260
她说有

323
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,960
这就是他的娃娃  他叫M先生

324
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,290
你欠我12罐沙士

你觉得这像谁

329
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,760
我和这人说  莫里斯
I tell this guy, I said, "Maurice--

330
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,450
我们已经拔了你半颗牙了
we've pulled out half your freaking teeth.

331
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,620
你还他妈等什么呢
What the hell are you waiting for?

332
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,020
牙仙吗
The tooth fairy?" Right?

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,440
他做了什么
So, what he does...

335
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,480
知道莫里斯做了什么吗  他对我笑
you know what Maurice does? He smiles at me.

336
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,600
然后我说  我要再拔你一颗牙
So I say, "I'm gonna take out another one, man."

337
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,690
我准备拔他的臼齿
I go to his molar.

338
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,430
我叫马里奥和盖布帮我一起拔
I got to get Mario and Gabe to help me pull it out.

339
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,580
失陪一下
Do excuse me.

340
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,520
我们就这样使劲拔
Right. So, we're, like, pulling it,

341
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,690
使劲拔
we're pulling it, right?

342
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,790
终于拔出来了
And finally we get it out.

343
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,990

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,570
是我
Yes.

345

来见我  我需要你

346
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,990
这就来  发生了什么事
I'm on my way. What's wrong?

347

有人抓走了莉莎  快点过来
Somebody took Liza. Come, quickly.

348

00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,270
你把她抓走了
You took her.

350
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,710

我就告诉这人说  让他说话吧
So I'm trying to tell this guy, "Let him talk."

352
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,220
因为他现在想说话  可我却听不懂
Because now he's trying to talk, but now I don't understand him

353
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,390
因为他没了牙齿
'cause he's got no teeth, right?

354
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,110
所以我说  让他说话  帮他清理干净
So I'm saying, "Let him talk. Clean him out.

355
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,430
他要告诉我们什么事呢
He's gonna tell us something."

马罗尼阁下  请原谅我

Penguin, you all right?

365

小子  你...
Hey, kid, what are you...?

不知道发生了什么事

369
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,090
就像是个无声的炸弹
It was like a silent bomb.

370
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,530
你知道是谁干的吧
You know who did this, right?

371
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,710
谁
Who?

372

几年前  杰克・布钦斯基

你就是其中一名同伙

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,100
你拿了他应得的一份  出卖了他
The one that took his share and sold him up the river, I expect.

379
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,640
这人是谁
What guy was this?

380
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,640
布...
Bu... uh...

381
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,230

他现在在找机会报复你

我想你一定会觉得无聊至极

两个警察和一位殡仪员一起上了渔船

要是拴头羊作诱饵
When you use a tethered goat as bait,

440
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,340
不是该把羊放进丛林里而不是关在房间里吗
shouldn't the goat be out in the jungle and not in the house?

441
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,770
这间房子是哥谭防卫最严的地方

布钦斯基疯狂自大还很诡计多端

Couple of hours.

449

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,120
我必须得走了
I-I must go.

451

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,220
让你妈妈等吧
Your mother can wait.

453
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,770
是她的心脏出问题了

但是  当然了
But... but, by all means,

457
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,770
当然了  她可以等
of course, she can wait.

458
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,210
你之前醒来时
When you woke up before,

459
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,000
你说你有紧急事务...
you said you had urgent business...

460
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,200
要找法尔科内
with Falcone.

461
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,550
真的吗
I did?

462

00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,320
真的
Did I?

464
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,160
卡麦
Carmine?

465
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,230
有人给我打电话说你的莉莎的事
Some people have called me about your girl Liza.

466
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,230
他们想要我帮忙做笔交易
They want me to help make a deal.

467
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,650
我没想到会是你
I didn't think it was going to be you.

468
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,270
真遗憾
I'm sorry.

469
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,840
我只是个中间人
I'm just an intermediary.

470
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,470
我只是想帮忙
I just want to help.

471
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,610
行了  亲爱的
Please, my dear.

472
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,160
够了
Stop.

473
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,860
我知道是你干的
I know this is you.

474
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,290
实诚点吧
Be honest.

475
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,140
是我
It's me.

476
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,420
果然如此
Of course it is.

477
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,050
咱们认识多久了
How long have I known you?

478
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,250
你是家族里最聪明的那一个
You're the smart one in the family.

479
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,590
我总是这么说
Didn't I always say so?

480
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,470
她不会受到伤害
She won't be hurt.

481
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,220
离开高谭
Leave Gotham.

482
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
仅此而已  离开高谭
That's all-- leave Gotham,

483
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,300
永远别回来
never come back.

484
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,700
你可以带走她
You can take her with you.

485
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,910
好的
Agreed.

486
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,170
这个决定很正确  我会去安排
That's the right decision. I'll make the arrangements.

487
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,720
你一直是我最喜欢的那个
You were always my favorite.

488
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,870
等我电话
Wait for my call.

489
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,110
他要走了
He's leaving?

490
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,060
你成功了
You did it?

491
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:32,900
老大
Boss?

492
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,530
那智慧  那眼界
The genius! The-the vision!

493
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,050
你终于搞掉了老头子
You brought down the old man... finally.

494
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,430
我们来庆祝吧
Let's celebrate.

495
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,720
布奇  现在不是庆祝的时候
Butch, this is not the time to celebrate.

496
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,590
他曾经是位伟大的人
He was a great man once.

497
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,000
如果他留下  别人也会干掉他
You don't think somebody would take him out if he stayed on?

498
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,830
我是在帮他忙  给了他条轻松的出路
I am doing him a favor and giving him an easy way out.

499
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,860
这是我欠他的
I owe him at least that.

500
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,000
当然
Of course.

501
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,600
你说的没错
You're right.

502
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,930
这样对大家都好
It's best for everyone.

503
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,480
他听起来怎么样
How did he sound?

504
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,680
伤心
Sad.

505
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,400
看着我
Look at me.

506
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,980
你有事瞒着我吗
Is there something you're not telling me?

507
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,710
没有
No.

508
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,050
你得和他一起离开城市
You're going to have to leave town with him,

509
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,350
跟他待一阵子
string him along for a while.

510
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,940
你觉得你能做到吗
Do you think you can do that?

511
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,470
可以
Sure.

512
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,410
可以
Sure.

513
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,610
不过你喜欢他  对不对
But you like him, though, don't you?

514
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,370
我可以喜欢他的吧
Well, I can like him, can't I?

515
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,800
他一直非常绅士
He's been a perfect gentleman.

516
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,790
他本可做出各种事
He could've done anything,

517
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,090
可他从没对我有非分之举
and he never laid a hand on me.

518
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,730
莉莎  你想怎么喜欢他都行
Liza, you can like him all you want.

519
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,510
但你绝不能告诉他真相
But you can never tell him the truth.

520
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,820
我知道
I know that.

521
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,540
阁下
Sir?

522
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,090
让我去搞定吧
Let me go to work.

523
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,680
不用
No.

524
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,440
不用
"No"?

525
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,870
如果菲什和其他人
If Fish and the others--

526
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,900
肯定还有其他人
and there must be others--

527
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,540
如果他们这么想让我退位
if they all want me to step away so badly,

528
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,730
那也许该是时候了
maybe it's time.

529
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,690
为什么不呢
Why not?

530
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,490
我还挣扎什么
Why am I still here fighting?

531
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,560
为了什么呢
For what?

532
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,990
为了尊重
For respect.

533
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,680
您是卡麦・法尔科内阁下
You're Don Carmine Falcone.

534
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,350
尊重
"Respect"?

535
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,230
谁在乎
Who cares?

536
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,300
他们都想让我去乡下跟莉莎一起生活
They all want me to go live in the country with Liza.

537
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,680
这也不错
I would like that.

538
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,260
我也想这样
That's what I want, too.

539
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,510
所以  为什么不照办呢
So, why not do it?

540
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,020
求您...
Please...

541
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,200
别说这种话  阁下
don't talk that way, sir.

542
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,990
只要我出马
And just me on my own?

543
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,370
我可以轻松干掉菲什的人马
I can take out Fish's crew easy.

544
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,970
你没在听  维克多
You're not listening, Victor.

545
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,660
你的工作是保护我和莉莎的安全
Your job is to keep me and Liza safe

546
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,100
直到交易完成
through the coming transaction.

547
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,020
仅此而已
That's all.

548
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,720
是  阁下
Yes, sir.

549
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,190
柯林格小姐
Miss Kringle?

550
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,830
干什么  干什么啊
What?! What?

551
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,320
杯型蛋糕很甜  子弹很致命
The cupcake is sweet, the bullet is deadly.

552
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,980
美丽的女人有致命的威力
A beautiful woman's a dangerous thing.

553
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,010
那个....
Um, uh, listen, I, uh...

554
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,110
这真是...
That is so...

555
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,550
我不...
I don't...

556
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,380
我都不知道该说什么了
I don't even know what to say to that.

557
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,410
尼格玛  你个变态  走开吧
Nygma, you perv, back off.

558
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,550
看不出人家姑娘嫌你烦吗
Can't you see the lady doesn't want you bugging her?

559
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,720
我
I, um...

560
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,230
你好啊  谁在烦谁了
Hey, there. Hey, now. Who's bugging who?

561
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,770
我只是...
I'm just, I'm just...

562
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,810
什么东西比红更绿
What's green and then red?

563
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,840
搅拌机里的青蛙
Frogs in a blender.

564
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,940
走开吧  尼格玛
Walk away, Nygma.

565
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,650
走开
Walk away.

566
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,610
如果我冒犯了你我很抱歉  柯林格小姐
I'm very sorry if I've offended you, Miss Kringle.

567
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,840
我绝无此意
That was not my intention.

568
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,910
你们听到了吗
Do you hear that?

569
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,170
走开
Go.

570
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,690
谢谢
Thank you.

571
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,430
他好怪啊
He is so weird.

572
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,260
我跟法尔科内毫无瓜葛
I have no business with Falcone!

573
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,410
我以我母亲的性命发誓
I swear on my mother's life!

574
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,240
如果我撒谎  就让上帝
May God strike her dead with horrible torment

575
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,330
令她惨死吧
if I'm lying!

576
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,700
好吧  朋友
Okay, then, my friend.

577
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,000
抱歉我怀疑了你
I'm sorry I doubted you.

578
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,360
去见妈妈吧
Go see your mom.

579
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,560
替我带好
Give her a kiss for me.

580
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,970
谢谢
Thank you.

581
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,300
就是他
There's the one.

582
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,290
被那个滑稽的家伙压在身下
Under that funny-looking fellow there.

583
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,930
把他带上车
Take him to the truck.

584
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,130
他们没烤焦
They didn't cook.

585
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,770
只是昏过去了
Just stunned.

586
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,300
我以为会更...
I expected more...

587
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,330
厉害点呢
oomph!

588
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,650
你要厉害的  杰克
You want "Oomph," Jack?

589
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,290
戈登警卫
Officer Gordon.

590
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,950
鞋子不错啊
Nice shoes.

591
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,190
是戈登警探
Detective Gordon.

592
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,830
你俩举起手
Hands up, both of you.

593
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:26,170
你还是把枪放下吧
You might want to drop that.

594
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,930
何必跟我作对  戈登
Why fight me, Gordon?

595
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,940
这里有谁
Who here

596
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,910
值得你保护
deserves your protection?

597
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,200
-有吗  -都值得
- Any of them? - All of them.

598
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,100
甚至马罗尼吗  得了吧
Even Maroni?! Please!

599
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,720
让我杀了这背信弃义的朋友
Just let me kill this false friend

600
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,690
继续生活吧
and get on with my life.

601
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,340
打得这么卖力
All this fight.

602
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,420
是为了什么呢
And for what?

603
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,630
我要把你关回阿卡姆  杰克
I'm putting you back in Arkham, Jack.

604
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,460
这才更接近真相  对吗  吉姆
That's closer to the mark, now, isn't it, Jim?

605
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,390
你需要赢  对吗
You need to win. Don't you?

606
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,280
你假装在乎法律
You pretend to care about the law,

607
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,070
但你真正的初衷  不过是骄傲
but in your heart, it's all primitive ego.

608
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,260
和对暴力及权力的渴望
And you lust for blood and power.

609
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,320
你只是不喜欢输
You just hate to lose.

610
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,250
告诉你
You know what?

611
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,950
你说对了
You're right.

612
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,390
我是不喜欢输
I do hate to lose.

613
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,750
恭喜你  年轻人
Congratulations, young man.

614
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,400
新的一天到来了
A new day.

615
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,130
是啊
New day.

616
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,550
下次再有人想夺走我的警徽
Next man that tries to take away my shield...

617
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,200
不管怎样
one way or another,

618
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,230
我要让他吃不了兜着走
I'm gonna make him eat it.

619
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,120
你说什么
Say again?

620
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,450
新的一天啊  局长
New day, Commissioner.

621
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,930
希望你有他的艳照做把柄
I hope you have some nasty pictures of him,

622
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,070
因为我敢说你刚刚一定撂了狠话
because I bet what you said was very, very rude.

623
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,130
我再也不要小心翼翼了
I'm done being careful.

624
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,720
你觉得你之前一直很小心吗
You think you've been careful so far?

625
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,690
洛布局长这种人是不会信任我的
Men like Commissioner Loeb are never gonna trust me.

626
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,640
你觉得你之前一直很小心吗
You think you've been careful so far?

627
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,780
何必跟他们客气呢
So why play nice?

628
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,680
你觉得
You think...

629
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,050
你之前一直很小心吗
you've been careful so far?

630
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:51,880
别担心
Don't worry.

631
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,090
我心里有数
I know what I'm doing.

632
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,390
我们去喝杯啤酒吧
Let's go grab a beer.

633
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,380
你这是糊弄我呢
Now you're messing with my mind.

634
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,490
我需要比酒劲头大的东西
I need something stronger than a beer.

635
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,510
安静  年轻人
Hush, young man.

636
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,640
我听得到你叹气
I can hear you sigh.

637
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,250
抱歉  先生
Sorry, sir.

638
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,040
让他过来
Let him be.

639
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,180
见到你很高兴  老朋友
It's good to see you, old friend.

640
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,040
很抱歉我这么晚才过来
I am so sorry it took me so long to get here.

641
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,300
今天我过得真是...
Such a day I've had...

642
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,360
我就不跟你您说了
I won't even tell you.

643
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:48,420
但我来了
But I'm here.

644
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,890
你对菲什的看法是对的
You were right about Fish.

645
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,330
是她劫走了莉莎
It's her that's taken Liza.

646
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,900
先生  允许我...
Sir, allow me...

647
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,950
我必须把我发现的事告诉你
I must tell you what I've discovered.

648
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,840
这话不太中听
You're not gonna want to hear this.

649
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,530
说吧
Speak.

650
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,600
莉莎是菲什有意插在您身边的
Liza was planted on you by Fish.

651
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,800
她是菲什的人
She belongs to Fish.

652
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,780
从头就是个陷阱
This was a setup from the start.

653
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,230
她找到个像您母亲的女孩
She found a girl that looked just like your mother,

654
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,150
训练好她
and trained her up...

655
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,830
不
No.

656
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,670
对不起
I'm sorry.

657
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,670
-拿出证明  -怎么证明
- Prove that. - How?

658
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,670
我做不到
I-I can't.

659
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,760
但我知道
I just know.

660
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,310
你错了
You're wrong.

661
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,630
我什么时候错过
When have I been wrong?

662
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,590
你好  菲什
Hello, Fish.

663
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,210
法尔科内阁下
Don Falcone.

664
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,510
我们在我这儿见面
We will meet at my place.

665
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,610
可以吗
Acceptable?

666
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,960
可以
Yes.

667
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,750
她在吗  莉莎在那儿吗
Is she there? Is Liza there now?

668
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,820
我能跟她谈谈吗
Can I speak to her?

669
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,810
不行
No.

670
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,660
什么时候
What time?

671
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,800
一小时后
In an hour.

672
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,560
我会去的
I'll be there.

673
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,470
菲什
Fish.

674
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,800
法尔科内阁下
Don Falcone.

675
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,710
我们怎么做
How's this work?

676
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,880
莉莎就在附近
Liza is close by.

677
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,580
我只需要你签文件
All I need for you to do is sign papers--

678
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,850
将家族的大权交出来
relinquish all control of the family--

679
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,240
然后你们就可以一起离开
and then you're both free to leave.

680
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,580
文件
Papers?

681
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,800
你以为有了文件就是老大了
You think papers make a don?

682
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,460
我给了你一条出路  卡麦
I'm offering you a way out, Carmine.

683
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,610
我明白
I appreciate that.

684
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,470
谢谢
Thank you.

685
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,490
但我要先见到她
But I need to see her first.

686
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,040
我签字之前
Before I sign anything,

687
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,790
我要确认她没事
I need to know she's all right.

688
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,860
她没事
She's fine.

689
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,830
我得见到她
I need to see her.

690
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,440
否则免谈
Or no deal.

691
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,240
你没事吧
Are you all right?

692
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,910
我没事
I'm okay.

693
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,260
你认识菲什・穆尼多久了
How long have you known Fish Mooney?

694
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:39,960
我不认识她
I don't.

695
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:41,820
我今天才见到她
I just met her now.

696
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,600
不
No.

697
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,000
有只小鸟告诉我
A little bird told me you and she

698
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,570
你们已经认识很久了
have been friends for a while.

699
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:51,900
不是的
No.

700
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,170
还说她跟你讲了关于我母亲的事
Told me that she told you stuff about my mother

701
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,100
好让你把我迷住
so that I'd get all caught up in you.

702
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,500
因为菲什知道
Because Fish knows.

703
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,090
知道我母亲的事
You know, about my mother.

704
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,310
你知道我多爱我母亲
You know how much I loved my mother,

705
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,020
因为我们谈过她的事
because we talked about her

706
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,170
我们经常谈起她
all the time, you and me.

707
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,950
记得吗  菲什  以前的时候
Remember, Fish? Back in the day?

708
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,150
记得
I do.

709
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,850
看来这只小鸟是在说谎了
It seems as though a little bird has been making a bit of mischief.

710
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,750
是啊
Yes.

711
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,040
我也希望是那样
That's what I had hoped.

712
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,790
但真相显而易见
But the truth is plain to see.

713
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,360
我对自己的愚蠢十分失望
I am very disappointed at my own stupidity.

714
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,240
对不起  莉莎
I'm sorry, Liza.

715
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
你是叫这个吗
Is that your name?

716
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,610
抱歉你卷进了这些事中
I'm sorry you had to get mixed up in this,

717
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,560
我相信你一定是个...
because I'm sure you're a...

718
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,690
诚实的好姑娘
good, honest girl, really.

719
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,270
别
No.

720
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,710
暂时留他俩一命
I want these two alive for now.

721
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,750
把他们关起来
Lock them up someplace.

722
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,350
别大喊求救了
Don't bother yelling for help.

723
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,940
你的人都死了
All your people are dead.

724
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,230
卡麦
Carmine...

725
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,320
你得明白...
you have to under...

726
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,990
我可以原谅各种背叛和谎言
I can forgive all kinds of betrayal and dishonesty.

727
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,970
但我母亲
But my mother?

728
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,980
你怎么敢用我神圣的母亲来对付我
How dare you use my sainted mother against me?

729
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,700
这太过分了
That's wrong!

730
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,780
-你要为此付出代价  -你得...
- You'll suffer for that. - I need you to...

731
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,130
谢谢  菲什
Thank you, Fish.

732
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,200
很久以来
For the first time in a long time,

733
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,970
我第一次感觉如此鲜活
I feel alive.

734
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,750
我记起了我的身份
I remember who I am.

735
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,860
我记起了我如何走到今天
I remember why I'm here.

736
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,760
-求你  -你可以出来了
- Just... - You can come out now.

737
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:42,240
你又说对了  我的朋友
Right, as usual, my friend.

738
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,040
快点道别吧
Say your good-byes quickly.

739
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,030
穆尼女士还有地方要去呢
Ms. Mooney has places to go.

740
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,300

747
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,460

没事

749

我就是正好在这一带
I was in the area,

她的确想要回娃娃  但是...
She does want her doll back, but, um...

756
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,720
也不全是为这个
Not entirely. No.

00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,380
你住这儿啊
You live here?

758

抱歉
Sorry.

就是一时兴起
A whim.

762
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,000
等等
Wait.

763
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:03,520
戈登  听说了吗
