1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,391
You will not believe what happened
at laser tag last night.

2
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:08,629
People freaked out because
a creepy man in a suit

3
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:11,934
- wouldn't leave their kids alone?
- No.

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,668
Well, yeah, pretty much.

5
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:19,640
Come on!

6
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:25,411
Ow! My shoulder!
- Come on.

7
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,387
Stinson, my office! Now!

8
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:30,721
Crap.

9
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:33,254
Disorderly game play,

10
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:35,925
three counts of shoving, and now this!

11
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:38,025
Stinson, you're a liability!

12
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:41,435
I know I don't play by
your "precious rules," McCracken,

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,735
but damn it, I get results!

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:46,810
Look, you're a good laser tag player,

15
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,804
maybe the best I've ever seen.

16
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:52,050
But one of these days,
you're gonna get someone hurt.

17
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,744
Maybe even yourself.

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,121
You just forget what it's like out there.

19
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,090
You've had your fat ass stuck behind
that desk for too long.

20
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:01,094
That's it! You're out of here, Stinson!

21
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:05,098
- Hand in your gun and your ID badge!
- With pleasure.

22
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:11,702
Please don't do this. This game is all I got.

23
00:01:12,008 --> 00:01:16,377
And I've almost got enough tickets
for the remote-control helicopter.

24
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,640
Please.

25
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:21,980
I can't believe I'm doing this.

26
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:24,186
But I'm gonna give you one last shot.

27
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:29,884
But so help me,
if you so much as step one toe out of line,

28
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:31,757
<i>you're gonna be playing Duck Hunt
in your mama's basement</i>

29
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:35,800
so fast it's gonna make your head spin.
Now, get out of here!

30
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:41,536
You won't regret this.

31
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,571
Whoa.

32
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,910
That's it, Stinson. You're banned for life!

33
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:58,651
No!

34
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:16,506
I can't believe you got kicked out of
laser tag. What are you gonna do?

35
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:19,480
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

36
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,143
I'll tell you what Ted and I are gonna do.

37
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:26,450
We're gonna break in after hours
and TP the place.

38
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:30,924
Barney, we are too old to cover
a place in toilet paper

39
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:32,758
just because they won't
let you play laser tag.

40
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:35,389
And for that matter,
we're too old for laser tag.

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,561
Ted, laser tag knows no age restrictions.

42
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:42,038
- Kind of like stripping in the Midwest.
- Yeah, whatever.

43
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:46,203
- I'm adding laser tag to the Murtaugh list.
- Oh, jeez, not the Murtaugh list.

44
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,712
- Yeah.
- What's the Murtaugh list?

45
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:49,782
<i>The Murtaugh list
is something that came into being</i>

46
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,282
<i>around the time I turned 30.</i>

47
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,020
<i>It all started with
your uncle Marshall's beer bong.</i>

48
00:02:56,324 --> 00:02:58,690
<i>When we were in our early 20s,
every time we had a party,</i>

49
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,556
<i>that beer bong came out.</i>

50
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:03,358
<i>And around the time we turned 30,
same thing.</i>

51
00:03:03,732 --> 00:03:06,428
<i>Of course, in our early 20s,
the next day would go like this.</i>

52
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:11,036
<i>But by the time we were 30,
the next day would go like this.</i>

53
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:17,012
<i>Then one day, in the throes of
the worst hangover of my life,</i>

54
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:20,345
<i>I realized there was only one person
in the world that I could relate to.</i>

55
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,715
<i>Detective Roger Murtaugh,
played by Danny Glover</i>

56
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:26,483
<i>in the '80s noir masterpiece
Lethal Weapon,</i>

57
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,751
<i>known for his oft-quoted catchphrase...</i>

58
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:29,952
I'm too old for this...

59
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:33,155
<i>Stuff. He said,
"I'm too old for this stuff. "</i>

60
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,660
It's sad to admit, but as you get older,

61
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:37,530
there's just certain things
you can't do anymore.

62
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:40,764
That's why I have this list,
so I never make the mistake of thinking

63
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:42,704
that I can still pull an all-nighter.

64
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:43,776
Oh.

65
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,935
I'm too old for that stuff.

66
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:49,072
Or eat an entire pizza in one sitting.

67
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:51,879
I'm too old for that stuff.

68
00:03:51,985 --> 00:03:54,852
Or hang posters on your wall
without frames.

69
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,720
Riggs. Riggs!

70
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,354
I'm too old for that stuff.

71
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,894
<i>By the way, how good is Lethal Weapon?</i>

72
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:04,625
I don't know. It's kind of a rip-off.

73
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,224
Old guy paired up
with a young, renegade cop.

74
00:04:07,436 --> 00:04:08,903
Sound familiar?

75
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:11,669
<i>Mackleroy and LeFleur.</i>

76
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:15,835
<i>Don't tell me you guys
have never seen Mackleroy and LeFleur.</i>

77
00:04:15,946 --> 00:04:19,177
It's the greatest Canadian action movie
of all time.

78
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:23,278
Mackleroy is a young, renegade Mountie
whose horse was just killed

79
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:24,649
- by evil Americans...
- Wait.

80
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:27,781
...while LeFleur, his grouchy,
old, African-Canadian partner,

81
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,883
- just bought a cozy ice-fishing shack...
- Wait.

82
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:31,019
...in northern Alberta.

83
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,892
- Now...
- Stop it!

84
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:37,167
- I got to go.
- Bye, baby. Have fun at practice.

85
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:40,137
Practice? Is he doing
that one-man band thing again?

86
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,333
'Cause that was a bummer.

87
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:45,573
<i>Actually,
Marshall had just taken over as coach</i>

88
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:47,669
<i>for Lily's kindergarten basketball team.</i>

89
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:50,682
<i>He thought it'd be fun,
but Lily saw it as something more.</i>

90
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:51,943
<i>Dad practice.</i>

91
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,987
- Hi.
- Hey! Oh, my gosh!

92
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:58,423
Orange slices. That is so sweet.
What are you doing here?

93
00:04:58,526 --> 00:05:01,654
I couldn't resist. I wanted to see
Coach Marshmallow do his thing.

94
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:02,787
Oh!

95
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:04,229
Okay.

96
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:06,801
Hey, kids, who wants to knock off early

97
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:09,565
and have some of these here
orange slices?

98
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:14,974
Yeah? Well, you can't!
Because oranges are for winners,

99
00:05:15,078 --> 00:05:18,411
and you little turds
haven't even made a single shot yet!

100
00:05:18,515 --> 00:05:21,780
You're embarrassing yourselves,
you're embarrassing Miss Aldrin,

101
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:24,980
and worst of all, you're embarrassing me!

102
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:28,054
That's it! Suicides! Baseline! Now!

103
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,386
Run.

104
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:37,332
Ted, there is not a single thing on here
that you are too old to do.

105
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:39,996
In fact, if you did everything
on the Murtaugh list,

106
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:41,801
I'd call that a pretty fun weekend.

107
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,567
Barney, you are not 18 anymore.

108
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,441
If you did everything on that list,
you would die.

109
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,609
- That wasn't a challenge.
- Challenge accepted.

110
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:55,246
In the next 24 hours, I'm going to do
every single thing on this list.

111
00:05:55,423 --> 00:06:00,123
And after I do, you will TP
the laser tag place with me.

112
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:01,422
And if you can't do it?

113
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,967
I will spend three hours
listening to you talk about architecture.

114
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:09,833
You have got yourself a deal.
Robin, will you do the honors?

115
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:11,670
A gentlemen's agreement!

116
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:12,741
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

117
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:18,941
All right, chumps, let's do this.
Barney Stinson!

118
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:21,744
You really want to make this bet with him?
You know how he is.

119
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:24,514
Robin, there is some pretty tough stuff
on that list.

120
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:28,319
Do you really think
Barney's gonna get his ear pierced?

121
00:06:28,426 --> 00:06:30,485
"Get ear pierced. " Check.

122
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:34,061
All right, I'm off to go
do laundry at Mom's house.

123
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:41,631
Hey, you guys mind if I crash
on your futon tonight?

124
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:44,711
- We don't have a futon.
- Put it over there, boys.

125
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,041
- What's going on?
- It's on the Murtaugh list.

126
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:50,207
"Crash on a friend's futon
instead of getting a hotel room. "

127
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,717
I am too old for that stuff.

128
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:54,814
Dude, what's going on with your ear?

129
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:57,390
It looks like the inside of a jack-o'- lantern
on November 3rd.

130
00:06:58,226 --> 00:07:00,991
What, this? Just a little infectsh.

131
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:03,030
Nothing a young guy like me
can't shake off.

132
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:05,564
Plus, "Put off going to the doctor,"
on the list.

133
00:07:06,735 --> 00:07:08,327
Oh. Hold on.

134
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:10,730
Go for...

135
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,240
Keep running!

136
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,543
You know what's funny is I was
supposed to come here to teach them...

137
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,244
Do not stop running!

138
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:27,417
This whole time, they've been the ones
who are teaching me. Hey!

139
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:31,823
That's not running! That's falling!

140
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:37,392
<i>The next morning, Barney
woke up on the futon in our living room.</i>

141
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:44,234
Check.

142
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:48,981
"Drinking shots with strangers. " Check.

143
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,541
You okay, Barney?
It looks like you hurt your back.

144
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:55,885
Oh, no. Just rocking a party hunch. I like it.

145
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,583
Closer to my booze. To youth.

146
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:10,204
Can I get a straw?

147
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:12,536
I must say, there is something admirable

148
00:08:12,642 --> 00:08:14,735
about the way Barney wants
to stay young at heart.

149
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:17,871
- I mean, who wants to get old?
- This guy.

150
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:23,449
Robin, life is a meal
and old age is the dessert.

151
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,419
I spend so much of my time worrying
about the future.

152
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:28,152
You know, "Where's my career going?
Who am I gonna marry?"

153
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:32,855
But when you're old, you don't worry,
'cause all that stuff's already happened.

154
00:08:32,965 --> 00:08:34,023
Plus, you get to wear comfy shoes,

155
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,295
and a chair takes you
up and down the stairs. It's perfect.

156
00:08:36,436 --> 00:08:40,497
That's not perfect. That's pathetic.
You can't just jump to the end.

157
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,199
The journey is the best part.

158
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:45,042
Oh, Robin, I used to feel that way, too,

159
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:48,411
but you'll understand when
you're a little bit older.

160
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,380
Marshall, can you try
not to pick on the kids today?

161
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:54,216
I'm not picking on the kids, Lily.

162
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:57,018
I'm picking on the culture of losing
around here.

163
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,855
I got to get them in shape
if they're gonna win that game tomorrow.

164
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:03,398
Win? We don't keep score.

165
00:09:04,967 --> 00:09:07,458
- What?
- We don't keep score.

166
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,328
You don't keep...

167
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,969
What's the point of playing if you don't
keep score? How do you know...

168
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:17,069
Lily, what were you doing with this team
before I got here?

169
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,409
I was coaching them.

170
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:19,573
Whee!

171
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:21,743
That's it, my little angels.

172
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,845
You're all luminous,
wonderful beings of light.

173
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:28,653
- What's the score?
- It's all tied up at fun to fun!

174
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,325
Because that's the point of playing,
to have fun.

175
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:36,401
No. The point of playing is
to win the trophy.

176
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:39,631
And if you don't know who's winning,
who gets the trophy?

177
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:44,540
Everyone. It's a participation trophy.
Everyone gets one.

178
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:48,709
It's like you're speaking Chinese
to me right now.

179
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:51,910
- Hi, this is Barney.
- And Robin.

180
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,281
We can't answer the phone right
now because...

181
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:54,411
He's watching sports and I'm...

182
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:55,512
Probably out shopping.

183
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:57,681
Uh-oh!

184
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:59,556
Leave a message and we'll call you
back just as soon...

185
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:00,685
- As...
- We...

186
00:10:00,796 --> 00:10:02,058
- Can!
- Can!

187
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:07,335
"Leave an annoying two-person message
on your answering machine. " Check.

188
00:10:07,637 --> 00:10:10,800
Probably gonna cost me some dates,
but it's okay.

189
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:14,666
- Barney, your ear's starting to smell.
- No, it's good.

190
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:20,143
I hate to send it back, but you did describe
the turkey as extremely lean,

191
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:22,277
and, well, you tell me.

192
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:25,412
All right. That's it.

193
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:27,252
- We have our own list.
- What?

194
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,657
This is a list of things
you're too young to do.

195
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,127
Go out and do each one of these things

196
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,494
and then tell me you still
want to be an old man.

197
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,691
Hmm.

198
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,297
Remove "Colonoscopy"
and "Have sex with an old lady,"

199
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,133
and this is a cakewalk.

200
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:44,741
New stakes, then. If I can finish your list
before you finish mine,

201
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:49,180
you have to come with me to TP laser tag,
and you have to buy the toilet paper.

202
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:52,481
And none of that biodegradable crap.
I want it up there forever.

203
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:54,885
Fine, but if I finish your list first,

204
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,482
it's a six-hour survey of early 20th-century
American architecture,

205
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:01,188
and you can never do anything
on the Murtaugh list ever again.

206
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:05,028
- It's for your own good.
- You, sir, have got yourself a deal.

207
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,466
A gentlemen's agreement!

208
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:07,558
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

209
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:14,935
Marshall, they're in kindergarten.
This isn't how you teach basketball.

210
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:18,573
- Sure it is. It's the way I learned.
- Are you kidding me?

211
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:21,685
What kind of sociopath
taught you this way?

212
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:27,686
- Come on, Dad. I'm tired.
- Sleep is for winners.

213
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:29,818
You can go to bed
when you score a basket.

214
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:33,126
- I'm trying.
- Let's give you two points for trying.

215
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:36,326
But negative two points
for having a great big head.

216
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:43,034
My father gave me no quarter,
and I asked for no quarter.

217
00:11:44,778 --> 00:11:46,973
I totally gotta call that guy.

218
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,842
Keep stretching!

219
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:56,088
"Put on reading glasses. " Check.

220
00:11:56,558 --> 00:12:00,825
"Yell at neighborhood kids. " My pleasure.

221
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:03,663
- Hey.
- Hey.

222
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:07,332
- What the hell happened to you?
- Oh, I just had a very minor

223
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:09,997
blew-out-my-knee-and-it-hurts-like-hell
incident.

224
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:11,096
How'd you blow out your knee?

225
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,075
We "Helped someone move out of
a sixth-floor walk-up

226
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:15,805
"in exchange for pizza and beer. "

227
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,312
Or we helped someone
rob a sixth-floor walk-up.

228
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:22,011
They were in a big hurry
and left all the pictures behind.

229
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,553
Whatevs. It counts.

230
00:12:24,423 --> 00:12:27,688
Now I am off to
"Dye my hair a funny color,"

231
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:30,159
- and then we are going to "Go to a rave. "
- Mmm-hmm.

232
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,729
Ooh! 4:00! Supper time.

233
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,995
Okay. So, your dad was tough on you.

234
00:12:37,103 --> 00:12:39,697
That stinks,
but you don't have to be like him.

235
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:41,831
You can learn from his mistakes.

236
00:12:41,942 --> 00:12:44,672
Mistakes? Lily, scoreboard.

237
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:47,405
The guy nailed it, okay?
He taught me how to be a winner.

238
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:50,643
That's what I'm teaching these kids.
And, for that matter,

239
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:52,583
that's what I'm gonna teach
our kids someday.

240
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:56,384
Okay, that's it. This is not how
we're gonna raise our kids!

241
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:59,289
And this is not how you're
gonna coach this team!

242
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:02,193
At tomorrow's game,
if you are anything less

243
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:05,699
than a teddy bear stuffed
with cotton candy and rainbows,

244
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:09,033
I will silent-treatment your ass
into the ground!

245
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:14,042
You'll think the time I found your Internet
search history was a freaking picnic!

246
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,577
Are we clear?

247
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:18,204
Lily, there are many different...

248
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:21,080
- Are we clear?
- Yes, ma'am.

249
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:28,223
You know, what's ironic is that now...
Lily, no!

250
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:37,232
Just call Ted. I want to go home.

251
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:40,500
All right. I'm calling him.
But it's 4:30 in the morning.

252
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:41,835
He's not going to be awake.

253
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:44,267
"Up at 4:00." Check.

254
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:47,708
- Is he answering?
- I haven't dialed yet.

255
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:50,648
Oh, please hurry, Robin.

256
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:53,285
Ooh, perfect.

257
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,652
"Take forever to answer the phone. "

258
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,588
Come on, Ted.
Someone gave me some aspirin

259
00:14:01,698 --> 00:14:03,427
and I don't think it was aspirin.

260
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,672
Check.

261
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:17,342
So, I know that I have been a little tough
on you for the past couple days.

262
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:20,418
And I apologize for that.

263
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:24,749
So today, we're not gonna worry
about winning.

264
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:28,325
We're gonna go out there and have fun.

265
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:32,593
<i>Kids, over the years,
your uncle Marshall has told and retold</i>

266
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:34,928
<i>the story of this game hundreds of times.</i>

267
00:14:35,034 --> 00:14:36,662
<i>And in reality, the kids on that other team</i>

268
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:38,670
<i>were probably only a grade older.</i>

269
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:42,901
<i>But in telling and retelling the story,
they came to look like this.</i>

270
00:14:53,656 --> 00:14:56,750
Yay! Way to let them score that easily.

271
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,550
Now you're sitting down. Awesome.

272
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:08,135
Addison, it's not soccer.
You don't kick the ball!

273
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,838
Unless that's something
that you think is fun,

274
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:15,003
in which case, great job having fun.

275
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,677
Whoa, that was a foul, wasn't it, ref?

276
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,619
My name's not Ref. It's Kenny.
And watch your tone.

277
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:26,190
No tone, Kenny. Great job, Kenny.

278
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,852
Thanks a lot, Kenny. See you later, Kenny.

279
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,892
All right, Barney. As your manager,
I'm throwing in the towel.

280
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,261
This bet is over.

281
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:38,031
Your ear looks like a free Danish
at a continental breakfast.

282
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:42,572
No. No. One thing left. "Beer bong. "

283
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:45,338
Oh! Coming right up.

284
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:51,343
I found these weird Russian beers
in the basement.

285
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:53,353
Russian beers? I'll take a brewski.

286
00:15:53,455 --> 00:15:56,789
Hey. Brewski. Get it?

287
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:00,427
Yeah, it's a little warm.

288
00:16:00,563 --> 00:16:01,996
Hope that's not a problem.

289
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:07,329
Don't. Okay. Don't, don't, don't.

290
00:16:08,872 --> 00:16:11,636
All right, Ted. You win. I hate this.

291
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:15,474
I hate all of it. My back is killing me.

292
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,878
Everyone at the rave thought I was a narc.

293
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:21,449
My ear hurts so bad I can hear it.

294
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:24,522
I can hear my own ear. Think about that.

295
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:27,652
My clothes...
What is it... What is it... What am I...

296
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,352
Get this stuff off of me!

297
00:16:29,495 --> 00:16:32,158
Ted, I'll pay you double for your finest suit.

298
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:34,800
Here's 30 bucks.

299
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,397
And throw in the shoes.

300
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:39,471
You win, Ted.

301
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:42,633
I'll never do anything on
the Murtaugh list again.

302
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:44,938
I'm too old for this stuff.

303
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:48,172
You know, Barney, last night,
I went to bed at 8:00

304
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:50,080
because it was on the list,

305
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:52,847
and I couldn't sleep because,
well, it was 8:00.

306
00:16:53,455 --> 00:16:55,082
<i>So I decided to watch Lethal Weapon.</i>

307
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:02,295
<i>And then, when I still couldn't sleep,
I watched Lethal Weapon 2.</i>

308
00:17:02,832 --> 00:17:04,595
<i>And then I watched 3.</i>

309
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:08,167
<i>And then, halfway through
Lethal Weapon 4</i>

310
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:09,569
<i>is when it occurred to me.</i>

311
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:13,340
Murtaugh kept saying,
"I'm too old for this stuff,"

312
00:17:13,444 --> 00:17:17,347
but every time he'd say it,
he'd turn around, make another movie

313
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,110
and do more stuff.

314
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:22,213
I guess what I'm saying is,

315
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:25,123
screw being old.

316
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,895
- Let's go TP laser tag, huh?
- Yeah.

317
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:32,055
And then the hospital.

318
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:36,797
Great job, guys.

319
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:39,531
At least we're not keeping score, right?
No idea what the score is.

320
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:42,370
Could be 53 to zero.
Could be some other score.

321
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,308
It's 53 to zero.

322
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:46,571
What are we doing wrong, Coach?

323
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:49,279
You know what?
You're not doing anything wrong.

324
00:17:49,418 --> 00:17:51,386
It's great that you guys are losing,

325
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,480
because in life, it doesn't matter
how much effort you put in,

326
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:59,221
or how hard you try,
people will just give you things

327
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,594
like diplomas and jobs and promotions.

328
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:04,462
So, it doesn't matter what
you do out there,

329
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:07,093
as long as you have fun.

330
00:18:07,872 --> 00:18:10,397
<i>At that point, because they
didn't want to fight in front of the kids,</i>

331
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:14,444
<i>your uncle Marshall and aunt Lily
had one of their telepathic conversations.</i>

332
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:17,674
<i>Don't you give me that look.
Lily, I can't take it anymore!</i>

333
00:18:17,783 --> 00:18:21,048
<i>- Your way of coaching is crazy!
Stop yelling at me!</i>

334
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:22,783
<i>Sorry.</i>

335
00:18:23,188 --> 00:18:25,987
<i>But can I please do it my way?</i>

336
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:31,355
<i>Fine, but I'm going to do it
my way, too. I'm getting my guitar.</i>

337
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,359
<i>I don't know if it was
Marshall's tough attitude,</i>

338
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:36,697
<i>Lily's gentle encouragement</i>

339
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:39,204
<i>or some magical combination of the two,</i>

340
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:43,971
<i>but in the second half of that game,
that ragtag group of little firecrackers</i>

341
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:46,606
<i>got beat down even worse.</i>

342
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,316
<i>In fact, according to your uncle Marshall,</i>

343
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,082
<i>in the second half,
the other team got even taller.</i>

344
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,818
<i>And one of them turned into a Teen Wolf.</i>

345
00:18:56,926 --> 00:19:01,387
Kenny! There is a Teen Wolf on the court!
That can't be legal.

346
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:07,063
I know the Teen Wolf looks different, kids,
but try to make sure he feels included.

347
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,105
Oh, yeah!

348
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,986
How is that not traveling, Kenny?
You're killing me!

349
00:19:30,096 --> 00:19:32,690
- You are absolutely killing me!
- Hey, watch it, Coach,

350
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,198
or you'll get a technical.

351
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,499
Oh, Kenny, I'm begging you
to give me a technical.

352
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,603
<i>When the final horn
mercifully blew,</i>

353
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:45,612
<i>the score was, by Marshall's estimate,
118 to nothing.</i>

354
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,773
<i>And even though they didn't win anything,</i>

355
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:51,475
<i>everyone, even the coach,
got a participation trophy.</i>

356
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:53,851
I understand if you don't want it.

357
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:56,882
I love it.

358
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:02,123
I just... I worked so hard. It feels good
to be appreciated for my effort.

359
00:20:02,232 --> 00:20:04,291
I know, baby.

360
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:10,766
Maybe your way is not totally stupid.

361
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,440
Thanks.

362
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,144
Your way is totally stupid.

363
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,513
Ow!

364
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,279
McCRACKEN: Stinson!

365
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,357
Son,

366
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:33,128
you have been a pain in my ass
ever since you joined this club.

367
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:40,006
But damn it, if this ain't some of
the finest TP work I've ever seen.

368
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,475
You're reinstated,

369
00:20:42,944 --> 00:20:45,470
- effective immediately.
- Really?

370
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:52,651
Hell, no! I'm calling the police!

371
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:55,787
Grown-ass man with pink hair
throwing toilet paper.

372
00:20:55,892 --> 00:20:57,621
You've got to be kidding me,
I'm too old for this...

373
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,525
<i>Stuff, he said, "Stuff. "</i>
