1
00:00:00,863 --> 00:00:02,295
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:05,878
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,946
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:11,949
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:15,553
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:17,455
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,457 --> 00:00:21,326
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:24,195
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:27,231
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,767
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:30,201
I stabbed your mother in the heart

12
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:31,736
and I was free.

13
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:33,171
Eddie is his ancestor.

14
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:34,706
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born.

15
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:36,675
He's being erased from existence.

16
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:38,376
- Gideon?
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

17
00:00:38,378 --> 00:00:40,144
- Where the hell am I?
- I was accepted

18
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:41,613
into the forensic science program

19
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:42,947
at Midway City University.

20
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:44,081
I'm leaving Central City.

21
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:45,550
Joe, you have a son.

22
00:00:45,552 --> 00:00:47,485
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

23
00:00:47,487 --> 00:00:49,086
These races? That's the only way

24
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:50,722
that I can pay for my
mom's hospital bills.

25
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:52,590
Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her.

26
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:53,825
Daddy? Please help me.

27
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:55,293
Don't let him take me back there.

28
00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:57,762
I would do anything to get you back.

29
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:02,934
There are many reasons why we run,

30
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:06,604
but usually it's to avoid
what's right in front of us...

31
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:07,905
a decision to be made

32
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:10,007
or a dilemma we have to face.

33
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,846
Lately, for me, it feels like
running is all I've been doing.

34
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:16,414
What you got for me, Cisco?

35
00:01:16,416 --> 00:01:18,450
You've been playing Good
Samaritan all morning.

36
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:19,818
Take a break.

37
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,853
Are you sure you don't
want to get to CCPD,

38
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:23,921
- give Patty your attention?
- No, I can see her later.

39
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:25,923
'Cause we cannot afford
to waste any more time.

40
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,258
What, 'cause we've just been

41
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,926
sipping Mai Tais since you got here?

42
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:30,495
I don't know what you been
sipping since I got here,

43
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:32,464
but Barry needs to get
better, stronger, faster.

44
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:34,699
We need to train to prepare for Zoom.

45
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,133
Oh, I see.

46
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:37,869
You haven't had your
coffee this morning.

47
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:39,637
I had my coffee this morning.
Don't slurp.

48
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,072
Don't. Don't.

49
00:01:41,074 --> 00:01:44,275
Don't.

50
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,013
Runaway chemical transport
truck heading south on Kester.

51
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:50,281
On it.

52
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:09,200
Hey, I can't stop the truck!

53
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:11,703
Somebody rigged it!

54
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:13,037
Sorry!

55
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,672
You can't let that truck crash.

56
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:16,107
If you do, you'll take
out a whole city block.

57
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:17,308
Great. Thank you.

58
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,577
Thank you for that.

59
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,382
That was close, that was close.

60
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,818
Oh, and the plot thickens.

61
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,185
Dead-end up ahead.

62
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,387
You got to get out of there!

63
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,023
Oh, come on.

64
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:34,426
Yes!

65
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:53,545
That one was a little close.

66
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:55,747
Nice! Now can you please,

67
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:58,349
please take a break?

68
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:00,452
- How's that for training?
- Great.

69
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:02,720
Look, we're gonna catch Zoom.

70
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:04,556
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

71
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,558
All we got to do is use him
to figure out how to steal

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,461
Zoom's speed and then we'll
get your daughter back.

73
00:03:09,463 --> 00:03:11,763
That might take longer than we thought.

74
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:12,931
Why's that?

75
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:14,866
Because Turtle's dead.

76
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:20,171
Barry, we need you back here stat.

77
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,539
All right. I'm on my way.

78
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:27,679
Gideon.

79
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:30,381
Was the trip a success,
Professor Thawne?

80
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,784
I believe it was. I've
finally figured out

81
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:35,353
what time period The Flash is from.

82
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:39,524
Now let's figure out a way to get home.

83
00:03:39,525 --> 00:03:42,440
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

84
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,865
He better not be pulling a Juliet.

85
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,534
Yeah, that's right. I see plays.

86
00:03:49,536 --> 00:03:52,436
- He's dead, Cisco.
- How'd this happen?

87
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,507
Preliminary brain scan shows
an acute brain aneurysm.

88
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:58,442
The night we captured him.
How's that for timing?

89
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:01,579
What does that mean? You
think I did this, Garrick?

90
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:04,015
This man is the key to us stopping Zoom,

91
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:05,316
the key to me saving my daughter.

92
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:06,751
Why would I want that?

93
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:08,720
Never understood why you
do anything, Harrison.

94
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:10,822
That's fine with me, Garrick.

95
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:13,758
Guys, look.

96
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,426
We need to figure out how to stop Zoom.

97
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:17,328
Everything we've tried
so far has failed.

98
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,963
We need to start thinking
outside the box.

99
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:20,264
I mean, we haven't even figured out how

100
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,566
to close the breaches yet.

101
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:23,001
Maybe that's where we should start.

102
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:24,368
That's a good idea.

103
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,270
- I'll get on that.
- I'll help.

104
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:29,607
I've got to get to the CCPD.

105
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,909
I'll check in with you guys later.

106
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:33,611
Okay.

107
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,880
Every time you think that
Wells is on your team,

108
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:39,083
something happens that
makes you doubt it.

109
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:44,288
Hey, I just wanted to see if you
could run this trace for me.

110
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,624
Someone messed with an ethanol
transport truck this morning.

111
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:50,127
They cut the brake line and
tampered with the gear shafts.

112
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,863
Okay, yeah.

113
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:53,064
Okay.

114
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,399
Wow. Backed up?

115
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:58,335
I am, yeah.

116
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:00,605
Yeah, I guess I'll find
out what that's like

117
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,139
once I finish CSI school.

118
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:03,841
Yeah, you will.

119
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:06,578
- Yeah.
- I guess.

120
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,512
Look, Barry, I know that you're upset,

121
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:11,783
but I was hoping it wouldn't
be like this between us.

122
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:17,822
I mean, what did you think
it was gonna be like?

123
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:21,225
I ju... I just thought we could
at least talk before I left.

124
00:05:21,227 --> 00:05:23,127
You're moving. I don't know.

125
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:24,963
I mean, it just doesn't
feel like there's much

126
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:28,933
to talk about now, right?

127
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:31,069
I guess not.

128
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:35,139
Hi.

129
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,643
- Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,815
I sort of overheard some of that.

131
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:48,653
Patty's going to CSI
school in Midway City.

132
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:50,955
She's moving in two days.

133
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:52,991
I mean, you don't have to let her leave.

134
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,525
She's wanted to be a CSI her whole life.

135
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,861
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.

136
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,030
Hey.

137
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:02,634
What's wrong?

138
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:05,703
Just went to see Francine and...

139
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:06,838
she doesn't have much time.

140
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,607
I already said my good-byes, if...

141
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:12,010
if you want to do the same.

142
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:24,488
It's not gonna work.

143
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,892
Closing the breaches, that's
like solving Einstein's riddle.

144
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:30,094
I solved Einstein's
riddle when I was ten.

145
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:31,328
Yeah, well, maybe Earth-2 Einstein

146
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,730
wasn't as clever as ours.

147
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:37,068
You realize this Earth
is my Earth-2, right?

148
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,770
Listen to this.

149
00:06:38,772 --> 00:06:42,974
What if we can figure out
how to control my powers?

150
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:45,176
We could find Zoom, get the jump on him.

151
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:47,545
That's a good idea. You
should get on that.

152
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,047
I need your help, Harry.

153
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:50,815
What you need, Ramon,

154
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:52,550
is to figure out what
triggers your vibes.

155
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:54,585
Exactly, and I don't
know what triggers them.

156
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:56,320
It's completely inconsistent.
Sometimes it's when I touch

157
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:57,955
something that belongs to a breacher,

158
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,490
sometimes it just happens.

159
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:01,826
There's always a cause. Cause, effect.

160
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:03,360
Doesn't take Einstein
to figure that out.

161
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:05,629
Okay, so what is the cause?

162
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:07,165
You saw when I tried to vibe Dr. Light,

163
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:12,170
when I tried to vibe you,
took a while to work.

164
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:14,939
Yes.

165
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:16,440
Yes, it did.

166
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:19,043
Meet me in the Time Vault.

167
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:21,079
For what?

168
00:07:27,887 --> 00:07:28,786
Hello?

169
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:33,124
Hello?

170
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:36,828
Harry?

171
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,567
Of course, now he's gonna make me wait

172
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,771
in this freaky-ass braille room.

173
00:07:48,742 --> 00:07:51,408
Hi, Cisco.

174
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,477
Stop! Don't do that!

175
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:58,950
I figured out your trigger.

176
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:01,953
A rush of adrenaline.

177
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:05,689
Dopamine floods the brain.

178
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:09,193
And the quickest way to
achieve that result...

179
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,830
Fear!

180
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:17,468
Do not move!

181
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,970
You can't be.

182
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,517
What did you see?

183
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,587
The Reverse-Flash.

184
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:38,589
He's here.

185
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:51,591
Oh, my God!

186
00:08:51,593 --> 00:08:53,994
Christina McGee.

187
00:08:53,996 --> 00:08:55,128
Who are you?

188
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,431
You're coming with me.

189
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,465
Flash.

190
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,434
Eobard Thawne.

191
00:09:00,436 --> 00:09:01,801
You know who I am?

192
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,803
You died!

193
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:05,605
Good to know.

194
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:07,441
And guess what, Flash.

195
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:10,743
I know what time period you're from.

196
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:15,548
So that means very soon... you will die.

197
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:27,595
VISITS US TUSUBTITULO.COM

198
00:09:27,596 --> 00:09:29,196
No.

199
00:09:30,199 --> 00:09:31,598
You okay, Bar?

200
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,134
I'm good, yeah. It's just a lot.

201
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:37,504
Eddie Thawne died, so Eobard Thawne

202
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:40,474
should have been erased
out of existence, right?

203
00:09:40,476 --> 00:09:42,609
Not necessarily.

204
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:44,777
It's possible Eobard was
in the Speed Force,

205
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,214
protecting him like a bomb shelter,

206
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:48,948
keeping him alive and
his time line intact.

207
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:51,018
It's what's known as a
"time line remnant""

208
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,519
A what now?

209
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:55,222
Here, let me... show you.

210
00:09:55,224 --> 00:09:57,024
This?

211
00:09:57,026 --> 00:10:00,860
This... is now.

212
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:02,662
Here, today.

213
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:06,333
This is the time Thawne comes from.

214
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:10,470
This is the moment you all
erased him from existence,

215
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:12,839
but since Thawne is from the future,

216
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:16,009
this is where his time line begins.

217
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:17,777
That's why he's still alive.

218
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,513
This Thawne has not yet traveled back

219
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:21,148
in time to kill Barry's mother.

220
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,316
He's here now in this time
period for the first time.

221
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,884
"Time line remnant."

222
00:10:24,886 --> 00:10:26,586
Explains why nothing's changed.

223
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:28,688
Yeah, it also explains why
he didn't know my name

224
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,957
or that we have met before.

225
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,026
To him, you hadn't.
Not until the future.

226
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:36,496
If Thawne dies before he
can time travel again,

227
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:37,897
will that save Barry's mother?

228
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:40,467
No. That's not how it works.

229
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,835
In our time line, Barry's
mother is already dead,

230
00:10:42,837 --> 00:10:44,237
and her death is a fixed point.

231
00:10:44,239 --> 00:10:45,505
Nothing can change that.

232
00:10:45,507 --> 00:10:47,274
All right, well, I'm gonna end this,

233
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:49,342
him, in this time once and for all.

234
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,378
Let's find Dr. McGee,
then we'll figure out

235
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:54,081
what to do about Thawne, okay?

236
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,283
I got to go check on Iris.

237
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,620
Ramon.

238
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,492
Caitlin, I know you're
worried about Dr. McGee,

239
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:07,026
but we're gonna get her back.

240
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:08,728
It's not that. It's Jay.

241
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,097
What about Jay?

242
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:12,932
He's sick, and it's getting worse.

243
00:11:12,934 --> 00:11:15,435
When Zoom stole his speed,

244
00:11:15,437 --> 00:11:18,638
it affected him on a cellular level.

245
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,440
We need to do something about it.

246
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:21,841
All right, like what?

247
00:11:21,843 --> 00:11:24,744
I think we should
replace his dying cells

248
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:27,747
with healthy ones
indistinguishable from his.

249
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,549
How do we do that?

250
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,985
We find his Earth-1 doppelganger.

251
00:11:33,822 --> 00:11:35,489
There.

252
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,824
Tachyons?

253
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,759
A man in a yellow suit tried to steal

254
00:11:39,761 --> 00:11:43,330
another tachyon prototype last year.

255
00:11:43,332 --> 00:11:45,332
I must have gotten
stuck here once before

256
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:48,768
and not been able to access
enough of the Speed Force.

257
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,069
Tachyons should do it.

258
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,538
I want you to isolate and accelerate

259
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,140
their energetic properties for me.

260
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:54,707
I don't know if I can do that.

261
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,003
If you want to stay alive...

262
00:12:04,004 --> 00:12:05,093
learn.

263
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:16,929
Franny.

264
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:19,032
Hey.

265
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:20,033
How you feeling today?

266
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:22,502
Better now.

267
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:28,341
I'm gonna let you two talk, okay?

268
00:12:28,343 --> 00:12:30,544
Okay.

269
00:12:37,553 --> 00:12:40,086
Can I get you anything?

270
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:42,121
Oh, just that brother of yours

271
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:47,160
so all of us can be together
for the first time.

272
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:49,095
Yeah, he should be here.

273
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:52,065
His mother is leaving him.

274
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:55,702
Can't blame him for
being angry about that.

275
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,737
I just wish he'd get all that anger out

276
00:12:57,739 --> 00:13:00,807
while I'm here to help.

277
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:04,110
Same thing goes for you, Iris.

278
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:06,179
One thing you learn when you're dying

279
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:11,050
is not to hold anything back.

280
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:14,521
You want to say something to me?

281
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:17,023
You need to say it while you can.

282
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:31,037
I have so many great memories
from when I grew up.

283
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,340
Now when I think about those memories,

284
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,174
I can only wonder what
it would have been like

285
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:39,679
if you and Wally would have been there.

286
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:41,481
I'm not angry at you anymore

287
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:45,452
for what happened.

288
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:48,321
I just wish you would have
come back to us a lot sooner.

289
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,793
Because I would have
forgiven you then...

290
00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:57,230
just like I'm forgiving you now.

291
00:13:58,767 --> 00:13:59,733
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:03,470
Thank you. Thank you.

293
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,819
I don't know why this is so hard.

294
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:21,521
I barely even know her.

295
00:14:28,463 --> 00:14:30,963
The facial recognition
software at S.T.A.R. Labs

296
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:32,465
didn't find anything either.

297
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,501
No, but there's still
more databases to check.

298
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:35,935
We'll find his doppelganger.

299
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:37,304
- Thanks, Barry.
- Yeah.

300
00:14:37,306 --> 00:14:40,006
Hey. Hi, Caitlin.

301
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,274
Hi.

302
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:43,610
Can we... talk?

303
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:45,244
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

304
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:47,213
I'll let you know what I find.

305
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:49,449
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

306
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,083
What's up?

307
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:54,153
I didn't know you were
working with S.T.A.R. Labs.

308
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,290
Yeah... yeah.

309
00:14:57,292 --> 00:15:01,194
Joe and I help out
every once in a while.

310
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:02,696
Really?

311
00:15:02,698 --> 00:15:04,431
Yeah, I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

312
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:08,702
but there's a lot of weird
stuff that happens over there.

313
00:15:11,272 --> 00:15:14,708
Is that what you came to tell me?

314
00:15:18,146 --> 00:15:22,148
You're just rolling with the
whole "me leaving" thing.

315
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,318
Yeah, well, I don't know
what to tell you, Patty.

316
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,823
Everyone in my life that I
love leaves at some point.

317
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:31,658
Kind of getting used to it.

318
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,862
You... never told me you loved me.

319
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:39,499
Yeah, I guess I don't
get that chance now.

320
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,335
I don't understand.

321
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:44,604
What is it? What's going on with you?

322
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:46,205
Why are you being like this?

323
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:49,108
My life is complicated,
and I don't want you

324
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,443
to have regrets, all right?

325
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:52,245
I don't want you to miss out

326
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:54,347
on something that you've
always wanted to do.

327
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:58,752
And I wish that things were different

328
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:02,021
for both of us.

329
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:04,858
You know, but they're not.

330
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,059
Sorry.

331
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:11,498
Me too.

332
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,946
So what did you do to my goggles?

333
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:29,449
I added a wavelength trigger

334
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,886
to stimulate the fear
receptors in your brain.

335
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:36,055
Then I took what you already
had to induce slow-wave sleep,

336
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:38,224
upgraded it to get you
to stage-four sleep.

337
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:39,592
No, this is good.

338
00:16:39,594 --> 00:16:41,294
- This will give us more control.
- Okay.

339
00:16:41,296 --> 00:16:44,096
Now I'll be able to dictate
how long you vibe for.

340
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:45,965
Put 'em on.

341
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:47,400
What am I gonna see?

342
00:16:47,402 --> 00:16:49,368
I don't know. Never done this before.

343
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,740
You'll have to tell me so I can
steer you where you need to be.

344
00:16:53,742 --> 00:16:57,644
Ramon, you want to find Reverse-Flash,

345
00:16:57,646 --> 00:17:01,448
put on the goggles.

346
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,682
Okay.

347
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:05,819
Attaboy.

348
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:11,458
Go ahead.

349
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:20,232
Yeah, man.

350
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,602
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

351
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:24,871
- What do you see?
- It's hard to explain.

352
00:17:24,873 --> 00:17:26,840
It's different events.

353
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:28,675
Different events in time.

354
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:31,377
Concentrate on The Reverse-Flash.

355
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:33,546
Okay.

356
00:17:35,984 --> 00:17:37,784
I see him.

357
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:39,986
Move toward him.

358
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,957
Okay, now what?

359
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:48,561
Try to picture him with Christina McGee.

360
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:51,531
Where the hell am I?

361
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:54,868
It's charged. You can go now.

362
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,936
You said you'd release me.

363
00:17:56,938 --> 00:17:59,506
Yes, I did. Didn't I?

364
00:18:02,377 --> 00:18:05,444
No!

365
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:12,151
Well, what is it?

366
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:14,153
She's dead.

367
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:21,769
Dr. McGee is dead?

368
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:25,974
Harry and I were trying to
hone my powers to find Zoom,

369
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:28,476
and then we ended up using them,
finding The Reverse-Flash,

370
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:31,145
and that's when I saw him kill her.

371
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:33,481
And then he left.

372
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:35,283
He left? What do you mean, he left?

373
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:37,918
McGee built him some
kind of speed machine

374
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,688
and he ran into and got
flung back to the future.

375
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:44,725
You'd need superluminal energy
to send someone through time.

376
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:47,028
- You mean like tachyons?
- Tachyons.

377
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,531
We can track their location
once they've been activated.

378
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:53,681
TACHYON SCAN
SCANNING

379
00:18:53,682 --> 00:18:55,536
- Anything?
- Nothing.

380
00:18:55,538 --> 00:18:57,472
Cisco, you're sure that's what you saw?

381
00:18:57,474 --> 00:18:59,073
- I'm positive.
- All right.

382
00:18:59,075 --> 00:19:00,574
What else did you see?

383
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:02,377
There was all sorts of
weird tech everywhere.

384
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:03,711
There was a clock.

385
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:07,382
What time did the clock say?

386
00:19:07,384 --> 00:19:08,916
9:52, I think.

387
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:10,218
How... how is that relevant?

388
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,721
It's 6:00 now.

389
00:19:13,723 --> 00:19:15,689
Are you telling me I can see the future?

390
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,191
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

391
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:19,027
Those goggles are getting
named immediately.

392
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:20,828
But that means Dr. McGee is alive.

393
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,530
- That's right.
- Yeah, okay.

394
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:24,232
We have 3 hours, 52 minutes to find her

395
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:25,599
and stop Reverse-Flash.

396
00:19:25,601 --> 00:19:26,867
Let's do it.

397
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:32,073
- Spivot.
- Hey.

398
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:33,841
Can't get away from those case files?

399
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:36,044
Oh, just following up on a hunch.

400
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,346
You're gonna miss the action, right?

401
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:41,549
Maybe. A little.

402
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,919
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Miss you too.

403
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:47,355
- It's nice to know someone will.
- Wait, we talking about Barry?

404
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:49,457
'Cause it sounds like we're
talking about Barry.

405
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,426
He kept telling me there was stuff

406
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:54,462
he couldn't share with me and
I've been going a little crazy

407
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,230
trying to figure out what that stuff is.

408
00:19:56,232 --> 00:20:00,501
Yeah, Barry's not great at sharing.

409
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,270
- Neither are you.
- What do you mean?

410
00:20:02,272 --> 00:20:04,305
Barry just told me that, you know,

411
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:08,076
sometimes he helps you out with S.T.A.R.
Labs stuff.

412
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:10,678
Yeah, he does when he has
a few extra minutes.

413
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,113
I didn't know that.

414
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:14,148
I mean, the whole time
I've been working here

415
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:19,087
you never mentioned it to me,
but then I realized why.

416
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,822
I went through some
of Barry's old cases.

417
00:20:21,824 --> 00:20:25,126
All of them involved The
Flash saving the day

418
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:30,131
with details that Barry couldn't
have possibly even known.

419
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,500
That's weird.

420
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:36,170
Yeah, it... it is weird.

421
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:38,206
The only thing that does make sense

422
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,809
is that Barry is The Flash.

423
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:43,911
Have you ever seen Barry run?

424
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:45,746
He waddles like a slow-ass duck.

425
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,415
There's no way he's The Flash, Patty.

426
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,949
You know, when I started this job,

427
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:51,885
you told me I had to learn
how to lie to do it.

428
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:54,054
You're a terrible liar, Joe.

429
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:58,559
See you.

430
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:07,801
Nice nitrous kit.

431
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,270
You're gonna get caught
one of these days.

432
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:12,039
You know that, right?
Get thrown in jail?

433
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,343
I'll stop racing when these
hospital bills stop coming in.

434
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:17,578
I saw Mom today. She
says you haven't been by

435
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,480
- in a while.
- Yeah, she knows why.

436
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:21,815
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

437
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:23,618
I have every right to be angry.

438
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,020
Nothing for 20 years,
then out of nowhere,

439
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:28,088
she tells me I have a sister, I have...
I have a father.

440
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,491
Yeah, the same thing happened
to me too, remember?

441
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:32,160
But that shouldn't keep
you from seeing her

442
00:21:32,162 --> 00:21:33,694
before you can't anymore.

443
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:36,397
No. Look... that's not what it is.

444
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:38,599
Then what is it, Wally?

445
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,869
I got to go.

446
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:45,906
Last year, my fiancé died...

447
00:21:45,908 --> 00:21:48,809
unexpectedly.

448
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:54,048
One moment he was here, the next...
gone.

449
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,417
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye to him,

450
00:21:56,419 --> 00:21:59,019
to tell him everything
that he meant to me,

451
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:01,589
that he was my world...

452
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:03,757
that he was loved.

453
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,127
But today I got to say
good-bye to your mom.

454
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:09,497
My mom.

455
00:22:09,499 --> 00:22:11,065
And it helped us both find peace

456
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,401
with what happened to our family.

457
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:14,968
Wally, don't make a mistake
you're gonna regret

458
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,904
the rest of your life.

459
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:20,441
Go see your mom while you still can.

460
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,252
No sign of tachyon activity.

461
00:22:31,254 --> 00:22:33,421
We're running out of time.
We've got to find them.

462
00:22:33,423 --> 00:22:35,456
It'll take a few minutes for
the device to reach full power

463
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,924
once it's activated,
but when we find it,

464
00:22:36,926 --> 00:22:38,826
you're gonna have to get there fast.

465
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:41,128
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah?

466
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,897
Have you found out anything
else about Jay's doppelganger?

467
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:46,701
There's no Jay Garrick on this Earth.

468
00:22:46,703 --> 00:22:49,537
That's so weird. Everyone
has a doppelganger.

469
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,839
Maybe just ask Jay.

470
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:53,741
He's a good guy.

471
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:56,244
Just ask him. I'm sure he'll tell you.

472
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:58,412
Okay.

473
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:01,249
Hey. Hold on.

474
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:04,318
What's up?

475
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,520
We got a problem. Patty
knows you're The Flash.

476
00:23:06,522 --> 00:23:08,256
- What?
- She caught me off guard.

477
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:10,625
I mean, I played it off, but
come on, she's a smart girl.

478
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:11,959
Anyway, she was going
through some case files

479
00:23:11,961 --> 00:23:13,160
and you were acting all squirrely.

480
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:14,729
This is my fault now?

481
00:23:14,731 --> 00:23:16,697
- No, it's nobody's fault.
- Oh, my God.

482
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:19,199
- Maybe you should tell her.
- No.

483
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:21,402
- Patty's trustworthy.
- It's not even about that, Joe.

484
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:25,205
I-I don't want another person
that Zoom or Reverse-Flash

485
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:28,576
or any of these meta-humans
can use against me.

486
00:23:28,578 --> 00:23:32,225
I don't want it. Patty
can't get hurt over this.

487
00:23:34,384 --> 00:23:37,318
Tachyons! 87th and Avenue J.

488
00:23:40,356 --> 00:23:42,931
Must be one of Mercury
Labs' off-site facilities.

489
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:43,457
Hack into their se...

490
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:45,025
I've hacked in the security feed.

491
00:23:45,027 --> 00:23:47,094
- And once that...
- I'm one step ahead of you.

492
00:23:51,668 --> 00:23:53,834
Barry, hurry up!

493
00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:55,869
It's charged.

494
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:59,373
You can go now.

495
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:02,042
You said you'd release me.

496
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:04,878
Yes, I did. Didn't I?

497
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,949
He's gonna kill her.

498
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,328
- You okay?
- Yeah.

499
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,595
Okay, get out of here, all right?

500
00:24:21,597 --> 00:24:23,397
Go! Go!

501
00:24:27,704 --> 00:24:30,904
That was my way home!

502
00:24:30,906 --> 00:24:32,272
You're not going anywhere.

503
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,707
You haven't won here, Flash.

504
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,496
I'll find another way back.

505
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
You're gonna have to
get through me first.

506
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,482
You really think you're
fast enough to stop me?

507
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:49,051
Let's find out.

508
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,653
Catch me if you can.

509
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:55,257
Oh, it's on.

510
00:24:55,258 --> 00:25:10,474
SUBTITLES CREATED FOR AND BY TUSUBTITULO

511
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,174
Get him, Bar.

512
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:24,654
Not fast enough, Thawne.

513
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,355
I will never lose to you again.

514
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:36,098
This war between us, it ends now!

515
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,503
Bar, you got to stop!

516
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:43,172
Bar, don't kill him! Just bring him in!

517
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,747
Get the cell ready.

518
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,190
Hey, he can't...?

519
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,325
Phase his way out? No, he can't do that.

520
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,427
It's the same cell we used to hold Dr.
Wells last year.

521
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:07,162
Barry, where you going?

522
00:26:07,164 --> 00:26:09,765
- I'm going down there.
- No, you're not.

523
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,100
The more he learns about you,

524
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:12,502
the more you will alter the time line.

525
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,169
He killed my mom!

526
00:26:14,171 --> 00:26:15,671
He's from the future. He
hasn't done that yet.

527
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:16,939
He doesn't even know you're The Flash,

528
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,374
and you need to keep it that way.

529
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,509
You already said that his mother's

530
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,010
gonna die no matter what we do.

531
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,245
There's ramifications
any time anybody messes

532
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:25,047
with the time line, and
it's impossible to predict

533
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:27,182
what those ramifications
are going to be.

534
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:29,251
Barry, you caught him
and you stopped him

535
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:31,787
from killing Dr. McGee.

536
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,723
In my book, that's a win.

537
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,391
This doesn't feel like a win.

538
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:39,996
I got to go.

539
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,711
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?

540
00:26:57,916 --> 00:27:01,383
My dad had multiple sclerosis.

541
00:27:01,385 --> 00:27:04,319
Every day for years, I watched

542
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:09,592
this amazingly strong man fight
for his life... and lose.

543
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:14,196
So, I can't sit by and watch
another man I care about

544
00:27:14,198 --> 00:27:17,600
fight for his life and not
do something about it.

545
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,602
I tried to find your doppelganger.

546
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:23,205
Same DNA, same cellular structure.

547
00:27:23,207 --> 00:27:28,243
I could replace your dying
cells with his living ones.

548
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:32,882
But... you don't have a
doppelganger on this Earth.

549
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,551
Caitlin, there is a good explanation.

550
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,454
Meet me at Hofherr Park
tomorrow and I'll show you.

551
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,789
Why can't you just tell me?

552
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:43,125
Because you need to see for yourself.

553
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:59,141
How'd you get your suit in your ring?

554
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:01,276
Who are you?

555
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:02,912
My name is Cisco Ramon.

556
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,347
And we know each other well, don't we?

557
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,649
We have a history together.

558
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:07,917
You could say that.

559
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,019
And that's all you want to know?

560
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,888
How I got my suit in my ring?

561
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,958
I want you to know that I'm the one

562
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,494
who figured out you were back.

563
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,263
I helped stop you.

564
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:23,332
Me.

565
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,466
And how'd you do that?

566
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:27,569
I have powers.

567
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:31,206
And I helped track you down
and I put you in here.

568
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:36,378
That's quite the ability
you've been given.

569
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,782
And here's what's so ironic about it.

570
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,051
You gave me these powers.

571
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:48,090
Have fun thinking about that
while you rot away in this cell

572
00:28:48,092 --> 00:28:52,194
that you helped me build.

573
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:53,595
Bye, Felicia.

574
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,323
Hey.

575
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:22,391
Hey.

576
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,759
Got your text.

577
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,828
I wasn't sure that you would see me,

578
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,897
considering you've been
avoiding me lately.

579
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:32,034
Patty, I haven't been avoiding you.

580
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,404
No, just... busy...

581
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,807
you know, speeding around Central City.

582
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:43,045
- I know you're The Flash, Barry.
- Patty, come on.

583
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:45,047
Please don't make me
feel any more stupid

584
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,481
than I already do.

585
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:48,150
Look, I'm a detective and
I should have known.

586
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,020
I was just... I was so smitten with you.

587
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,222
Okay, look, what...

588
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,924
what you're saying, it's insane.

589
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,359
Look, you don't have to
lie to me anymore, okay?

590
00:29:57,361 --> 00:30:01,263
I understand... I understand why
you didn't want to tell me.

591
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:02,765
I understand why you've been distant.

592
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,433
Look, I understand everything.

593
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,401
But just tell me the truth now.

594
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:08,003
Just be honest with me.

595
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:12,842
Just... admit to me you're
The Flash and I'll stay.

596
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:15,344
I can't do that. I'm not him.

597
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,384
It's too bad. It would
have been nice to stay.

598
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:24,220
Fight crime during the day

599
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,021
and be with you at night.

600
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:27,823
But I was... I was wrong.

601
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:29,024
Take care, Barry.

602
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,975
Is that you, Flash?

603
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,844
Why do you hate me so much?

604
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,080
I didn't always.

605
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,252
I was obsessed with you.

606
00:30:56,254 --> 00:31:00,256
For so long, I wanted to be The Flash.

607
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:04,160
I spent years figuring
out how you came to be.

608
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:08,630
Duplicated the reaction...
and it worked.

609
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,701
I became like you.

610
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:14,270
Right, so what happened?

611
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:20,242
This ability to travel through
time revealed a truth.

612
00:31:20,244 --> 00:31:23,312
My fate was to become
your greatest enemy.

613
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,081
I was never going to be The Flash,

614
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:29,084
so I became the reverse of
everything that you were.

615
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:33,055
The more people you saved,
the more you were loved,

616
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,124
the more I had to take from you.

617
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,493
That is why you killed my mother?

618
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:42,898
That's why you ruined my life?

619
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,599
Because you couldn't be me?

620
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:48,137
I became better than you!

621
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:53,075
I am the one thing you
cannot stop, Flash!

622
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,677
No, no, no.

623
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,146
Not anymore.

624
00:31:57,148 --> 00:32:00,015
Our race is over.

625
00:32:00,017 --> 00:32:02,651
And you lost.

626
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:06,121
I've learned what time
period you're from, Flash.

627
00:32:06,123 --> 00:32:10,226
And one day soon, I'll learn your name.

628
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,198
We need you in the cortex now!

629
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,073
What's happening?

630
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,307
He's experiencing an
uncontrollable amount

631
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:26,976
of electrical energy in his brain,

632
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,178
putting him in a prolonged
state of chronic seizing.

633
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,379
What? Can you stop it?

634
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,582
I don't know.

635
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,266
- Hold him down!
- We're trying!

636
00:32:41,268 --> 00:32:43,235
- Sedate him, Snow, now!
- Come on! Come on!

637
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:45,270
Benzodiazepine. This should do it.

638
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:52,578
Finally.

639
00:32:54,248 --> 00:32:56,449
- What?
- What was that?

640
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:58,584
What's going on? Where the hell am I?

641
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:00,319
- Cisco!
- It's the time line.

642
00:33:00,321 --> 00:33:01,920
What? What are you talking about?

643
00:33:01,922 --> 00:33:04,223
When you... when you
captured Reverse-Flash,

644
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:05,791
we ruptured the time line.
That's what this...

645
00:33:05,793 --> 00:33:08,293
all the blood and the
seizures and that and all...

646
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,996
Cisco is being affected to... to...

647
00:33:10,998 --> 00:33:12,598
by the changes to the time line.

648
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,333
The changes to the past or the
changes to the present...

649
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:15,801
this is what this is. We
need to do something.

650
00:33:15,803 --> 00:33:17,603
- We need to do it fast.
- Like what?

651
00:33:17,605 --> 00:33:18,937
We need to restore the time line.

652
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:20,939
Barry, you need to get Reverse-Flash

653
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:22,941
and send him back to the
future as quickly as possible.

654
00:33:22,943 --> 00:33:24,477
- What? Are you...?
- Barry...

655
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:26,111
I just caught him! You
want me to let him go?

656
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:28,180
Keeping him here is killing Cisco!

657
00:33:28,182 --> 00:33:29,849
Barry, if this is the
only way we can save him,

658
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:31,216
you got to do it!

659
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,018
- You got to let go of Thawne!
- I can't.

660
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,620
Okay, all right, look.

661
00:33:34,622 --> 00:33:36,722
I destroyed the tachyon
drive in the speed machine.

662
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,323
There's no way it'll
reach a speed necessary

663
00:33:38,325 --> 00:33:39,492
to send him back home.

664
00:33:39,494 --> 00:33:41,026
- You can.
- What?

665
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:43,295
Your speed coupled with Thawne's speed,

666
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:45,731
that'll be enough to catapult
him through the time continuum.

667
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,099
You can do it.

668
00:33:49,937 --> 00:33:51,169
All right. All right.

669
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,539
Let's do it. Let's do it.

670
00:33:58,746 --> 00:33:59,812
Time to send you home.

671
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:02,648
The time paradox. Yeah.

672
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,418
You've all messed with something
you don't understand.

673
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,086
Can you do me a favor and just shut up?

674
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:14,092
And how exactly are you
going to send me home?

675
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,528
Don't worry about it.

676
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,431
You fixed Dr. McGee's tachyon device?

677
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,577
No, I came up with a different method.

678
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:21,219
__

679
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:25,571
Is that so?

680
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:28,741
Who are you?

681
00:34:33,147 --> 00:34:37,182
No one of consequence.

682
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,785
No.

683
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:40,986
I doubt that.

684
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:48,427
I win again, Flash.

685
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:51,597
All you have to do is provide
him with enough momentum

686
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,265
to get him past the space-time barrier.

687
00:34:53,267 --> 00:34:55,701
- All right.
- Hey, listen to me.

688
00:34:55,703 --> 00:34:58,370
Thawne knows about you.

689
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:01,173
Right here, right now.

690
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:04,009
This is where he learns
about you, all of you.

691
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:05,644
It's how he knows about S.T.A.R. Labs,

692
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:07,513
how he knows about me...

693
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:09,314
the Harrison Wells from this Earth.

694
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,750
And there's nothing I can do about it.

695
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:13,352
There's nothing you can do about it.

696
00:35:13,354 --> 00:35:17,289
This is his origin story,

697
00:35:17,291 --> 00:35:21,360
and it's going to happen
no matter what you do.

698
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:25,965
But right here, right now...

699
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:28,634
you can send him back to his time.

700
00:35:28,636 --> 00:35:31,003
You can save your friend.

701
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:35,875
You can save Cisco and then
move on with your life.

702
00:35:35,877 --> 00:35:38,043
This could be a good thing.

703
00:35:38,045 --> 00:35:40,679
You can finally let go of him.

704
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,681
I could throw him three
centuries from now.

705
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:44,049
He'll always be a part of me.

706
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,588
Time to send you back where you belong.

707
00:35:55,863 --> 00:35:58,130
We'll meet again soon, Flash.

708
00:35:58,132 --> 00:35:59,665
I know.

709
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:02,467
And every time, I'll be ready for you.

710
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:23,956
Hurry.

711
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:51,884
He did it.

712
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:14,807
He's gonna be okay.

713
00:37:23,254 --> 00:37:25,455
I don't understand
what we're doing here.

714
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:27,289
Well, just like you, I
thought that if I could find

715
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,258
my doppelganger on this Earth,

716
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,662
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

717
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:35,498
And believe me, I was
just as shocked as you

718
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,167
when I couldn't find a
Jay Garrick anywhere

719
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:41,804
on this planet.

720
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:45,842
Took me a while to figure it out...

721
00:37:45,844 --> 00:37:47,844
but eventually I found him.

722
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:52,715
His name is Hunter Zolomon.

723
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,283
Hunter Zolomon?

724
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:56,051
Why doesn't he have
the same name as you?

725
00:37:56,053 --> 00:37:57,319
From what I could gather,

726
00:37:57,321 --> 00:37:59,254
his mother died during childbirth.

727
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:01,256
He bounced around from family to family,

728
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:04,126
but eventually was adopted
and raised by the Zolomons.

729
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:09,866
But why does that mean
he can't help you?

730
00:38:09,868 --> 00:38:14,436
My DNA was mutated when
I became a speedster.

731
00:38:14,438 --> 00:38:17,940
There's only one way to reverse
what's happening to me.

732
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:21,878
If we can catch Zoom, I
can get my speed back.

733
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,648
Then let's finally figure out
the best way to do that.

734
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:39,629
- Wally, hi.
- Hey.

735
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:41,998
Do you want to come in?

736
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,900
No, I-I can't stay. I just...

737
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:46,402
I wanted to tell you that
I'm gonna take your advice

738
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:48,704
and go see my mom.

739
00:38:48,706 --> 00:38:52,942
Okay.

740
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:56,045
Iris, I was... I was wondering

741
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:58,881
if you would come with me.

742
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:01,617
Yeah, yeah, I would...
I would love that.

743
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:02,985
- Yeah?
- Okay.

744
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:14,997
My head feels like it's in a vise.

745
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:20,036
What happened?

746
00:39:20,038 --> 00:39:22,939
I think you vibed one
too many dimensions.

747
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:25,007
Maybe I should stop doing that.

748
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,077
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

749
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,048
How did you... get the vibing to stop?

750
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:36,485
We sent Thawne back to his time.

751
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,253
You let him go?

752
00:39:38,255 --> 00:39:40,189
I couldn't let him take
another person I cared about.

753
00:39:44,428 --> 00:39:48,263
- Thank you.
- Of course.

754
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:51,100
Okay, I think I need a Big Belly burger.

755
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,768
- Anyone?
- I'm good, thank you.

756
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:55,504
- Yeah, no pickles.
- Two triple triples, please.

757
00:39:55,506 --> 00:39:56,839
You got money?

758
00:39:58,576 --> 00:40:01,844
Rest up, all right? I'll be out here.

759
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:07,516
So, Patty... she's on a train
to Midway City right now?

760
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:10,252
I had to let her go too.

761
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:13,756
I was thinking about what you said,

762
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:18,193
that part of being The Flash
is that you have the ability

763
00:40:18,195 --> 00:40:21,163
to do amazing things
that nobody else can do.

764
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:23,198
And we see now that a
hundred years from now,

765
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,967
you'll still be doing them.

766
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:26,769
But the other part is,

767
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:29,772
you're gonna be loaded with sacrifices,

768
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:33,109
and you're gonna have
hard choices to make,

769
00:40:33,111 --> 00:40:37,379
and there's gonna be a lot
of things where eventually

770
00:40:37,381 --> 00:40:40,482
you'll have to let 'em go.

771
00:40:40,484 --> 00:40:44,553
You got to be ready for that.

772
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:48,423
I am. I'm ready.

773
00:40:48,425 --> 00:40:51,694
That's my boy.

774
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:58,300
That's weird.

775
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:00,703
- Hey.
- Barry, I'm on the train.

776
00:41:00,705 --> 00:41:02,504
There's a... there's a man with a gun.

777
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:05,474
All right, hold on.
I-I-I'll get you help.

778
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,249
Is everyone okay?

779
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:16,686
Everyone's fine.

780
00:41:16,688 --> 00:41:20,890
It was a false alarm, but...

781
00:41:20,892 --> 00:41:22,725
thanks for coming so fast, Flash.

782
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:33,202
Just want to make sure
everything's okay before I go.

783
00:41:33,204 --> 00:41:35,437
Don't worry.

784
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,439
Everything's good.

785
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:55,925
Good-bye, Barry.
