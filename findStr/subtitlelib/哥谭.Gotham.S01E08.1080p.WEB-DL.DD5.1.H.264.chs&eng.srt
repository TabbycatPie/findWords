1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,320
《哥谭》前情提要
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,120
听着  我还有事得处理
Listen. There are things I need to do.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,410
你不走我也不走
If you stay, I stay.

4
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,250
我叫维克多・萨斯
My name is Victor Zsasz.

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,010
我来这里是为了找吉姆・戈登
I'm here for Jim Gordon.

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,950
所有人都出去
Everybody out.

7
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,170
哥谭市不会有一个警察敢站出来帮你
There's not a single cop in the city who will help you.

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,310
我是不会帮你的
I won't help you.

9
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,240
我是不会离开的
I'm not leaving.

10
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,550
你不用跟我一起来的
You don't have to join me.

11
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,030
反正我横竖都是死
I figure I'm doomed anyhow.

12
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,540
倒不如跟好人搏一把
I might as well join the good guys.

13
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,010
我要找的不是美女
I ain't looking for no girl.

14
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,540
而是武器
I'm looking for a weapon.

15
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,690
打扰
Excuse me.

16
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,510
你想为这个小瘪三而挑起战争吗
You want to start a war over this punk?

17
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,070
那小家伙会逗我开心
The little guy amuses me.

18
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,960
何必为点小事而搅起战火呢
Why go to war over trifles?

19
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,970
你就留着他吧
We'll let you have him.

20
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,910
算是送你的礼物
Our gift to you.

一大早就这么倒霉
Hell of a way to start the day.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,190
我刚洗过领带
I mean, I just cleaned this.

29
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,080
哈维
Harvey.

30
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,030
警员巡逻发现了尸体
Uniforms found the body.

31
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,750
没有钱包  身份证  表也没了
No wallet, no ID, no watch.

32
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,910
他被人暴打过
He got beaten up pretty good.

33
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,370
我猜致命伤是他颈侧的
I'm guessing the cause of death is that gigantic gash

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,740
那道巨大裂口
in the side of his neck.

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,490
是吗  他身上黑乎乎的是什么
You think? What's all the black on him?

36
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,270
墨水  涂料
Ink? Paint?

37
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,340
早  爱德
Good morning, Ed.

38
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,490
早  警探
Detective.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,990
根据凝血程度判断
Going by overall coagulation,

40
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,640
我认为死亡时间是在午夜时分  但是
I'd say time of death is midnight. But...

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,930
他几小时前才被抛尸于此
He's only been here for a couple hours.

42
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,730
老鼠才刚开始啃他的耳朵
Rats have just started on his ears.

43
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,050
狡猾的小东西
Sneaky little buggers.

44
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,730
那就不是抢劫杀人  打劫的不会移尸
So, not a mugging. Muggers don't move the body.

45
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,780
他的指关节有擦伤
Abrasions on his knuckles...

46
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,960
看来奋力抵抗了
Put up a fight.

47
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,880
瞧瞧他的吊带裤
Yeah. Look at the suspenders.

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,450
应该是金融界的
I'm guessing he's some kind of finance guy.

49
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,130
也许有人绑了他索要赎金  结果事态恶化
Maybe it was an abduction ransom thing gone wrong.

50
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,230
他反抗  就被撕票了
He resists, ka-chunk!

51
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,420
要跟发现尸体的巡警谈谈吗
Do you want to talk to the uniforms that found the body?

52
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,680
你去吧
Uh, you do it.

53
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,080
我们还得在附近做排查
We should canvass the area, though;

54
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,180
这里有很多流浪汉出没
a lot of homeless around here.

55
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,670
我找些警员来办
I'll get some unis on it.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,720
我自己去
I'll handle it myself.

57
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,970
喂  乔
Hey, Joe!

58
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,890
去别的地方抽烟
Go smoke somewhere else, huh?

59
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,950
别这样  吉姆  小警员就是用来使唤的
Come on, Jim, that's what we got uniforms for.

60
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:58,700
让他们来吧
Let them do it.

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,140
我宁可自己来
And I'd rather handle it myself.

62
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,070
两位警探
Detectives...

63
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,480
我是不是该把每根手指的指纹都验一遍
I'm guessing I should run all the prints?

64
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,790
对  爱德  都验一遍
Yeah, Ed, run the prints.

65
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,870
这根也要吗
This one, too?

66
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,630
对  爱德  这根也要
Yeah, Ed, that one, too.

67
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,310
连游艇都算不上
It wasn't even a proper yacht.

68
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,550
就是个小破船
No, it's more like a dinghy.

69
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,450
有事吗
Can I help you?

70
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,730
胸针真好看
What a lovely brooch.

71
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,880
谢谢
Thank you.

72
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,620
可以给我吗
May I have it?

73
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,000
我有个朋友一定会喜欢的
I have a friend who would love that.

74
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,990
你说什么
Excuse me?

75
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,110
抱歉
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,650
可以给我吗  拜托了
May I please have it?

77
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,050
你太客气了
You shouldn't have.

78
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,720
我想表示诚意
I wanted to make a gesture.

79
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,240
希望我们日后
I hope, in time,

80
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,270
能成为朋友
we can be friends.

81
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,660
朋友
Friends?

82
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,990
也是
Sure.

83
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,050
有何不可  过去的都过去了
Why not? What's done is done.

84
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,650
我很高兴你能这么想
I'm so glad you feel that way.

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,930
马罗尼阁下要我们理一理协议
Don Maroni wants us to clarify terms.

86
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,560
生意还是跟以往一样
Well, it's business as usual.

87
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,380
毒品归马罗尼卖  他还有工会
Maroni still has his drugs, his unions.

88
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,510
进口关税由他出
He pays tariff for the ports.

89
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,910
如果他需要警察或是市长的帮助
If he needs favors from the cops or the mayor,

90
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,040
法尔科内阁下也会考虑的
Don Falcone will consider it.

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
当然了  阿卡姆项目还是大家一起做
And, of course, the families still share Arkham.

92
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,150
两边都不需要流血牺牲
And there is to be no blood spilled on either side.

93
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,770
一点都不会
Not a drop.

94
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,880
也许有一点
Maybe just a drop.

95
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,990
瞧瞧你啊
Look at you.

96
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,860
蒂莫西
Timothy,

97
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,710
你知道这家伙以前就做你的工作吗
do you know this fellow used to have your job?

98
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,670
替我打伞  还觉得特荣耀呢
Carried my umbrella and thought it an honor.

99
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,140
现在瞧瞧他
Now look at him.

100
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,500
已经能跟我坐一张桌子了
Has a seat at the table.

101
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,980
世事无常啊
Things change, eh?

102
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,180
我很幸运
I've been blessed.

103
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,950
或许我该拆礼物了
Perhaps I should open your gift.

104
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,210
老天
My goodness.

105
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,840
真漂亮
That is beautiful.

106
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,360
这下我都不好意思了
Now I feel awful.

107
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,670
-我都没给你买什么  -不用
- I didn't get you anything. - No.

108
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,590
谢谢你
Thank you.

109
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
滋味儿不错
Sweet.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,330
没这个必要吧
That was uncalled for.

111
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,950
我把你纳入家门
I brought you into my family

112
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,830
视你如己出
and I treated you like a son!

113
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,870
但你却背叛了我
And you betrayed me.

114
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,070
我也因此遭过罪了
For which I suffered.

115
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,400
远远不够
Not enough.

116
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,410
我要让哪个蠢货去死
When I order some fool killed,

117
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,230
那人就得死
I expect him to stay that way.

118
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,720
你的老大  法尔科内阁下
Your boss, Don Falcone,

119
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,600
明确表示...
expressly said...

120
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,100
没错没错  他想要和平
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he wants peace.

121
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,800
他是你现在还活着的唯一原因
He's the only reason why your ass is still alive.

122
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,970
我要是你
And if I were you,

123
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,990
就会祈祷他长命百岁
I would pray for his good health.

124
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,370
我会的
Oh, I do.

125
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,210
我会的
I do.

126
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,760
很好
Good.

127
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,920
要记住
'Cause remember...

128
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,760
世事无常
...things change.

129
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,590
代我向你的阁下问好
Convey my respects to your Don.

130
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,980
你也是
Likewise.

131
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,160
和平
Peace...

132
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,530
朋友
friend.

133
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,940
哥谭
第一季  第八集

134
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,150
来吧  布鲁斯少爷
Come now, Master Bruce.

135
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,290
该来的总要来
Had to happen sooner or later.

136
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,270
真有这必要吗
Is this really necessary?

137
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,830
在家自学一样有效
Homeschooling is just as effective.

138
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,060
我可以给你看数据
I can show you the data.

139
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,090
你需要跟同龄的孩子待在一起
You need to be around children your own age.

140
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,040
为什么
Why?

141
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,670
因为你需要
'Cause you do.

142
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,400
你知道我不喜欢这样的回答
You know I despise that sort of answer.

143
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,570
你不想你的同学吗
Don't you miss your mates?

144
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,490
不怎么想
Not really.

145
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,380
我一直觉得他们有点幼稚
I've always found them kind of childish.

146
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,810
他们本不就该幼稚吗
Well, that's what they're meant to be, aren't they?

147
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,260
这个年纪就这样
That's what they do.

148
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
你难道不想
Don't you want to be

149
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,070
像个正常孩子一样吗
like a normal kid?

150
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,520
我不确定
I'm not sure.

151
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,330
讲讲什么算"正常"  再说服我做个正常孩子
Define "normal" and make a good case for it.

152
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,030
你必须得去上学
You're going to bloody school.

153
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,860
去吧
Now start walking.

154
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,310
祝你好运  孩子
Good luck, lad.

155
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,650
节哀顺变  女士
Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

156
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,380
你能想到任何会想伤害你儿子科曼的人吗
Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your son Coleman?

157
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,440
没有
No, sir.

158
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,600
没有人
Nobody.

159
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,270
他是个好孩子
He was a good boy.

160
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,820
是的  夫人  看得出来
Yes, ma'am, I can see that.

161
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,370
无犯罪记录  老实的年轻人
No arrests. An honest young man.

162
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,580
他是做什么的
What did he do for a living?

163
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,740
他在咖啡店上班
Uh, he worked in a coffee shop.

164
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,960
我们找到他时  他穿着西装
When we found him, he was in a suit.

165
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,030
吊带裤
Suspenders.

166
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,260
他想进入金融业
He was looking for a job in finance.

167
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,050
他很有志气
He was very ambitious.

168
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,350
我们家第一个大学生
First in our family to go to college.

169
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,680
谁会下此毒手  这是为什么
Who would do this, sir? Why?

170
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,400
我们会尽力查明真相  女士
We'll do our best to find out, ma'am.

171
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,220
戈登与死者母亲谈完话了
Gordon's finishing up with the mother.

172
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:00,890
目前为止  断指上查不到什么
So far, nothing off the severed thumb

173
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,530
市内又没有哪家急诊室收治过没有拇指的人
and none of the city's ERs have seen any thumbless guys.

174
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,730
你觉得他是去黑市了吗
You think he went black market?

175
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,430
正准备去查
That's next on my list.

176
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,810
戈登怎样了
How's Gordon?

177
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,670
很生气
Angry.

178
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,410
假如这里的每个警察都抛弃了你  你会怎么想
How would you feel if every cop in the building ran out on you?

179
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,120
如今人人都把他视作为瘟疫
And now they all treat him like he's got the plague,

180
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,140
因为看见他  他们就会想起自己多么懦夫
'cause seeing him reminds them of what cowards they all are.

181
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,740
抱歉  警监  我...
I'm sorry, Cap, I...

182
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,030
我不是在说你
I didn't mean you.

183
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,800
不
Nope.

184
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,870
你说的没错
You're right.

185
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,500
但他必须翻过这一页
But he's gotta get over that.

186
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,260
他不能孤军奋战
Can't do this job alone.

187
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,080
幸好他还有你
Lucky he's got you.

188
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,800
是啊
Yeah.

189
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,270
太漂亮了
So beautiful.

190
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,790
我一看到这个
As soon as I saw it,

191
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,110
就想到了你
I thought of you.

192
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,500
我的好儿子啊
Such a good son.

193
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,090
给我戴上  给我戴上
Put it on, put it on.

194
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,530
发生什么了
Wh-What happened?

195
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,960
谁干的
Who did this?

196
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,680
没谁
N-Nobody.

197
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,480
就是个抓伤...只是...
It's just a scratch. It's...

198
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,130
当你母亲是傻子吗
Is your mother a fool?

199
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,640
不对  有人欺负我儿子
No. Someone is being mean to my boy.

200
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,420
这行很凶险
It's a tough business.

201
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,860
如今餐饮业都这么凶险了吗
The restaurant business is so tough these days?

202
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,830
为什么会这样
Why is that?

203
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,090
我的成功引起了其他人的嫉妒
My success makes other people envious.

204
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:15,050
那就向老板告这些人的状啊
So tell the boss on these people.

205
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,660
这人不怕老板
This person isn't scared of the boss.

206
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,800
没有应有的敬畏
Not like they should be.

207
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,610
我不明白为什么
I don't know why.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,150
我明白
I know.

209
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,690
我上学的时候
When I was in school,

210
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:31,020
玛格达・汉密法布对我特别坏
Magda Himmelfarb was so mean to me

211
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,460
而老师也听之任之
and teacher did nothing.

212
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,930
为什么
Why?

213
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,390
因为我当时是个很好的舞者
Because such a good dancer I was.

214
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,710
而玛格达
And Magda,

215
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,970
留着一头秀发
with her nice hair

216
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,660
长着一对大胸
and her big bosoms,

217
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,490
就是个人尽可夫的婊子
a carthorse.

218
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,400
我是想问...
I meant...

219
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,810
为什么老师听之任之呢
why did the teacher do nothing?

220
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,580
你觉得呢
Why you think?

221
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,600
他们说老师给她"单独授课"
"Private lessons," they said.

222
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,480
我制止了他们
I put stop to that.

223
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,860
你告发了他们吗
You told on them?

224
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,330
不是的
Oh, no.

225
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:05,190
我向秘密警察揭发了玛格达的父亲
I denounced Magda's father to secret police.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,890
三周了
Three weeks

227
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,470
他一直对我设的陷阱不屑一顾
he's been turning up his nose at my traps,

228
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,830
而今天呢  我放了软质乳酪
and now, now, today, a smidge of Camembert

229
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,480
老鼠先生就抵挡不住诱惑了
and Mr. Rat, he cannot resist.

230
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,420
抵挡不住  不是吗
No. Oh, can you?

231
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,860
是不是啊  我贪婪的小宝贝
Can you, my little greedy baby?

232
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,560
我发现你的秘密了
I found out your secret!

233
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,240
没错
Yes.

234
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,780
人人都有秘密
Everybody has a secret.

235
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,240
吗啡

236
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,670
吗啡

237
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,370
这是在医学院学来的吗
They teach you that in med school?

238
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,970
布洛克
Bullock.

239
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,840

我不问问题
I don't ask.

244

这是我们说好的  对吧
I mean, that's the deal, right?

250

你提供消息  我们就让你继续经营
You give us info and we let you keep operating?

251
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,720
这是句双关哦  经营和手术

混蛋医生抓起来  就能改变什么吗
Doc scumbag there is gonna make a difference?

那你就拿我的备用枪
So you got out my spare?

303
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,730

305
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,430
天呐
God.

306
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,520
喝着酒就不该碰武器
Not the best idea to be handling a firearm when you've been drinking.

307
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,680

I can feel that monster, Zsasz,

313
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,150
-跟踪我  我...  -他不是怪物
- stalking me, and I... - He's not a monster.

314
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,660
他只是个人
He's just a man.

315
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,880
我不会让任何人伤害你的
I won't let anyone hurt you.

316
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,720
这你要怎么保证
How can you promise me that?

317
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,910
告诉我不会有事的
Tell me it'll be okay.

318

告诉我真的没有什么怪物
Tell me there really aren't any monsters.

319
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,890
不行的话
Just...

320
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,550
骗骗我也好
lie if you have to.

321
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,960
真的没有怪物
There aren't any monsters.

322
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,500
我们什么时候能离开这里
When are we gonna get out of here?

323
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,940
这就要看你了
That's up to you.

324
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,100
早上好
Morning.

325
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,780
我以为你还没起床
I didn't think you were up.

326
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,700
昨晚我只是精神紧张
Look, last night was just nerves...

327
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,230
而且喝了太多酒
and way too much to drink.

328
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,920
我说过我想分担你一半的包袱  我如愿了
I said I wanted half your life, and I've got it.

329
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,070
把枪留下吧
Leave the gun.

330
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,640
真希望事情不是这样
I wish it wasn't like this.

331
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,850
你真这么想吗
Do you really?

332
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,160
别理我  我只是太累了
Ignore me. I'm just tired.

333
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,670
去吧
Go.

334
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,720
去抓坏蛋
Catch some bad guys.

335
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,810
好
Okay.

336
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,890
爱德华・尼格玛鉴证报告

340
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,500
晚点再吃另一半
saving the rest for later.

341
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,670
一个死人  一艘游轮
What do a dead man, a cruise ship

342
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,050
和鸸鹋有何关联
and emu have in common?

343
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,330
没错  毫无关联
Correct, nothing.

344
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,040
越来越有趣了
Ever more curious.

345

他什么
He what?!

346
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,420
尼格玛  我和你说了多少次
Nygma, how many times have I told you

347
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,870
不要进这里来
to stay the hell out of here?

348
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,360
-但是我有发现...  -你再这样做
- But I discovered something. - You'll discover

349
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,520
我就把你扔到街上
your butt in the street if you keep doing this.

350
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,700
出去
Out.

351
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,030
这是你的损失
Your loss.

352
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,550
你个粗心又无知的人
You sloppy ignoramus.

353

布鲁斯  你好
Hi, Bruce.

我很好  你呢
I'm well, how are you?

357

挺好的
You know, chilling.

358
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,750
你爸妈被杀了  是吗
So, uh, your mom and dad got killed, huh?

359
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,520
-是  -你目睹了整个过程吗

360
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,550
血溅当场吗
The blood and everything?

361
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,260
我不想说这件事
I'd rather not talk about that.

362
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,510
我只是感兴趣而已
I was just interested.

363
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,160
我从未见过真正的尸体
I've never seen a real dead body.

364
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,130
露肠子了吗
Was there guts?

365
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,170
我要去上课了
I'll be going to class now.

366
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,330
原谅我  院长  我有罪
Forgive me, Mother, for I have sinned.

367
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,060
真逗
Funny.

368
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,750
在这儿见面感觉很怪
It feels weird, meeting here.

369
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,270
你不会希望被人看见我们在一起的
You don't want anyone to see us together.

370
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,630
法尔科内到处都有耳目
Falcone has his eyes everywhere.

371
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,900
进展得怎么样了
So, where are we?

372
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,340
我为他做饭
I cook for him,

373
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,690
给他唱歌
I sing to him,

374
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,350
我们一起散步
we go on walks.

375
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,760
我不知道我是他的女佣  他的情人
I don't know whether I'm his maid, his lover

376
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,080
还是他妈妈
or his mother.

377
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,940
或是三者皆有
Or all three.

378
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,000
他在乎你
He cares about you.

379
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,580
对
Yeah.

380
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,440
你进过他的私人办公室吗
Have you been inside his private office?

381
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,700
进过
Yeah.

382
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,140
好几次
A few times.

383
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,380
在书桌右手边最下面的抽屉里有本账簿
Inside the right bottom desk drawer is a ledger.

384
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,520
拷贝下最后两页
Copy the last two pages.

385
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,200
抽屉是锁着的  你需要钥匙
It'll be locked; you will need a key

386
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,550
从他钥匙链上拿
off of his key ring.

387
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,570
我怎么拿得到
How do I get that?

388
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,520
你身后有个小瓶子
Behind you is a vial.

389
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,940
让他喝下
Give it to him.

390
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,880
他会睡死两个小时
He'll sleep like the dead for two hours.

391
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,470
这个不会害死他吧
It won't kill him, will it?

392
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,620
莉莎
Liza,

393
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,550
你不会对那老头产生感情了吧
you haven't caught feelings for the old man, have you?

394
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,700
完全没有
Not at all.

395
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,630
那东西不会害死他
No, it won't kill him.

396
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,280
现在杀了他只会制造混乱
Killing him now would only create chaos.

397
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,540
我需要吸取他的力量
I need to siphon his strength.

398
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,590
等时机一到
So when the time is right,

399
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,580
推翻他的统治
taking over his organization

400
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,000
就会如同戴手套一样轻松
will be like slipping on a glove.

401
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,080
如果他的哪个手下
What if one of his men

402
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,690
撞见我乱翻呢
catches me snooping?

403
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,120
那你多半死定了
Then you're probably dead.

404
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,440
你先走
You leave first.

405
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,370
好好好
Right, right, right.

406
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,800
我这里压力很大
I'm under a lot of pressure.

407
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,020
即刻成功
准备上战场

408
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,500
我感觉咱们来对地方了
Something tells me we came to the right place.

409
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,970
可不是
You think?

410
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,750
西恩尼斯先生现在可以见你们了
Mr. Sionis will see you now.

411
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,440
理查德・西恩尼斯
Richard Sionis.

412
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,550
詹姆斯・戈登
James Gordon.

413
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,920
这是我搭档  哈维・布洛克
This is my partner, Harvey Bullock.

414
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,430
有什么能帮上忙的吗  警探
How can I help you detectives?

415
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,530
我时间不多
I don't have much time.

416
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,600
你认识这个人吗
You know this man?

417
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,700
科曼・劳森
Coleman Lawson?

418
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,410
他或许来面试过工作
He might have interviewed for a job.

419
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,520
抱歉  不认识
Sorry, no.

420
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,160
你员工昨天有没来上班的吗
Any of your employees miss work yesterday?

421
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,170
有人今天来上班时右手受伤吗
Any of them show up today with an injured right hand?

422
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,100
我不负责点名  警探
I don't take roll call, Detective.

423
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,360
我们能搜查下吗
You mind if we check?

424
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,710
或许你能告诉我这是怎么回事
Perhaps you can tell me what this is about?

425
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,320
科曼・劳森两天前被杀了
Coleman Lawson was killed two night ago.

426
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,120
凶手的口袋里有你们公司的名片
The man who did it had your firm's card in his pocket.

427
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,850
他能拿到名片的地方可多了
Well, there's a thousand ways he could've gotten that.

428
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,080
这些武士玩意是怎么回事
What's with all the warrior baloney?

429
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,370
它们能激励我
It inspires me.

430
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,440
高级金融是个艰难的行当
High finance is tough business.

431
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,330
想要成功  就必须变成武士
In order to succeed, you have to be a warrior.

432
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,470
不  不需要
No, you don't.

433
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,000
当好生意人就可以了
You have to be a good businessman.

434
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,910
武士是打仗的
Warriors fight wars.

435
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,270
完全不同
It's different.

436
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,400
你是把自己想象成杀手了吗
So you fancy yourself a killer?

437
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,280
你杀过人吗  西恩尼斯先生
Have you killed people, Mr. Sionis?

438
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,350
没动过真格的
Only metaphorically.

439
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,340
所以这些只是在玩过家家吗
So all this is just juvenile play acting.

440
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,440
没错
Exactly.

441
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,580
看来你是真上过战场
Thus speaks a man who's seen actual combat.

442
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,260
你真杀过人  对吧
You've killed people for real, haven't you?

443
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,600
真正的杀手一眼就能看出
True killers are easy to spot.

444
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,290
是的  没错
Yes, they are.

445
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,840
那些面具是干吗的
Why all the masks?

446
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,970
心理医生会说你想隐藏什么
A shrink would say you're hiding something.

447
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,050
正相反
To the contrary.

448
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,610
面具虽隐藏了面孔
A mask hides the face,

449
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,130
但却释放了灵魂
but frees the soul.

450
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,000
面具道出真相
A mask speaks the truth.

451
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,760
真深奥
Deep.

452
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,620
为什么你手下那么多员工都挂彩了
How come so many of your employees have scars and injuries?

453
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,980
我们触身式橄榄球打得很激烈
Our touch football games get very rough.

454
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,960
你在撒谎  西恩尼斯先生
You're a liar, Mr. Sionis.

455
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,540
好大的火气
Such fire.

456
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,160
你一定很想念战场吧
You must miss the battlefield desperately.

457
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,050
我猜杀人会上瘾呢
I imagine killing gets quite addictive.

458
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:41,340
你杀了科曼・劳森  是不是
You murdered Coleman Lawson, didn't you?

459
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,680
证据呢
Prove it.

460
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,360
我们会找到的
We will.

461
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,850
我倒想唱红脸
I'd give you a good cop routine,

462
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,900
可惜我不会
but it's not in my tool kit.

463
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,320
哥谭市警局
GCPD.

464
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,130
慢慢转过身来
Turn around slowly.

465
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,690
举起双手
Let me see those hands!

466
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,390
不许动
Don't move!

467
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,180
你应该等我的
You should've waited for me.

468
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,330
好啊  小布
Hey, Brucey.

469
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,630
我叫布鲁斯
It's Bruce.

470
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,620
不是什么小布
No "y."

471
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,000
你没爸没妈  我愿怎么叫你就怎么叫
No parents, either, so I can call you what I like.

472
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,350
麻烦你  别挡我的道
Please, get out of my way.

473
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,160
还挺嚣张啊
Snobby little jerk, isn't he?

474
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,340
你个孤儿
For an orphan.

475
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,550
你很过分
You're being very unkind.

476
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,780
我不知道你为什么这样
I don't understand why.

477
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,030
天啊  你可真怪
Boy, you're a weirdo.

478
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,330
你妈妈一定...
Your mother must...

479
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,330
不许提我妈妈
Don't talk about my mother.

480
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,770
是吗
Oh, really?

481
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,950
是蒂莫西吗
Oh, is that Timothy?

482
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,350
我们在菲什・穆尼那儿见过面
We met at Fish Mooney's, hmm?

483
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,110
我以前做你的工作
I'm the fellow who used to have your job.

484
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,660
我想问你几个问题
I was hoping to ask you a few questions.

485
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,570
我什么都不知道
I don't know any...

486
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,210
有你说话的时间
They'll be time for that.

487
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,140
首先
First things first.

488
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,450
多数凶手会在犯罪现场留下手印  而你却不
Most killers leave their prints at the crime scene, but not you, no.

489
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,050
你把整个大拇指都留在了死者嘴里
You left your whole thumb in the dead guy's mouth.

490
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,310
挺有风格的  我喜欢你  小子
You got style! I like you, kid.

491
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,780
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance.

492
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,060
一旦我们走出那扇门
Once we walk out that door...

493
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,620
你就完蛋了
It's over.

494
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,980
我是自卫
It was self-defense.

495
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,190
那当然了
Of course it was.

496
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,690
我不就是这么说的吗  吉姆
Wasn't that what I said, Jim?

497
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,070
我不就说有可能是自卫吗
Didn't I say it was probably self-defense?

498
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,320
交待
Talk.

499
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,110
戈登在做剩下的笔录
Gordon's getting the rest of his statement.

500
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,960
他说那是招聘的一个步骤
Apparently it was part of the hiring process.

501
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,850
西恩尼斯让最后三位候选人打架定胜负
Sionis told the top three candidates to fight it out.

502
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,420
本来不该打得你死我活  但...
They weren't supposed to fight to the death, but...

503
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,070
真是难以置信
This is unbelievable.

504
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,810
他们都签了保密协议
They all signed confidentiality agreements,

505
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,570
发生了什么  他们都会是从犯
so they're accomplices to whatever happens.

506
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,860
知道他们在哪里斗殴吗
Do we know where the fight was held?

507
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,990
老办公楼
Some old office building.

508
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,940
窗户都用木板封住了
The windows were boarded up.

509
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,270
他被带进去时双眼是蒙住的
And he was taken there blindfolded.

510
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,380
什么事  爱德
Yes, Ed?

511
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,040
打印机碳粉
Printer toner.

512
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,030
你知道他在说什么吗
Do you know what he's talking about?

513
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,860
法医报告说是黑墨
The medical examiner's report said it was black ink.

514
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,830
但我做了检查  是打印机碳粉
But I did my own examination, and it was printer toner.

515
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,700
而且  我在他肩膀上找到了订书针
Also, I pulled staples from his shoulders.

516
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,970
还在肋骨间找到了石墨碎片
And found graphite chips between his ribs.

517
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,250
这人是在办公室被杀的
Your man was killed in an office.

518
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,590
这个我们已经知道了  爱德  谢了
Yeah, we're kind of past that, Ed, but thanks.

519
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,630
-还有什么发现吗  -有
- Is there something else? - Yes.

520
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,380
这让我想起一年前的一个案子
It made me think of a case from a year ago.

521
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,330
年轻人  穿西装
Young man, business suit,

522
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,070
被人用索引卡塞进喉咙  划破了食管
esophagus lacerated from index card shoved down his throat.

523
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,140
于是  我深入调查了一番
So, I did some digging...

524
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,940
还有多少人是被用办公用品杀死的
How many other bodies were killed with office supplies?

525
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,550
过去三年里  共有四个
Four... in the last three years.

526
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,590
让他签认罪书  赶紧
Get that man to sign a confession. Now.

527
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,250
好像有麻烦了
I think we have a problem.

528
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,520
我跟戈登警探解释过了
I explained to Detective Gordon,

529
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
作为亚当斯先生的法律顾问
as counsel to Mr. Adams

530
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,280
我建议他保持沉默
I'd advised him against speaking further.

531
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,540
他所作的任何供述都将
Also, any statements he has made will be considered

532
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,930
被视为逼供
having been made under duress.

533
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,680
西恩尼斯给了他多少钱让他来顶罪
Uh-huh, and how much is Sionis paying him to take the fall?

534
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:51,510
再见
Good day.

535
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,310
亚当斯给口供签字之前他就来了
He showed up before Adams could sign his statements.

536
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,640
我们得搞清楚西恩尼斯在哪举行殴斗
We got to figure out where Sionis is staging these fights.

537
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,240
我去查他和他公司在哥谭所拥有的大楼
I'll run all the buildings he or his company owns in Gotham.

538
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,460
你能理解这种事吗
This make any sense to you?

539
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,880
不能  不过也不会比山羊杀手和气球人更糟了
No, but how's it any worse than the Goat or the Balloonman?

540
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,710
这种事什么时候变成日常了
When did this become normal for this city?

541
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,860
是什么变了
What changed?

542
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,970
也许什么都没变  也许一直都藏在表面下
Maybe nothing. Maybe it was always just below the surface.

543
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,350
只需一点刺激
Only needed a spark.

544
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,590
比如托马斯和玛莎・韦恩的死
Like Thomas and Martha Wayne being killed?

545
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,920
我可不瞎  戈登
I'm not blind, Gordon.

546
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,750
我知道你还在查这个
I know you're still looking into it.

547
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,360
但是他们的死怎么会引发这些事情
But how could their deaths have caused all this?

548
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,990
他们为什么那么重要
Why were they so important?

549
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,860
我想是因为他们的意义
I think it's what they represented.

550
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,010
他们代表了一个不同的哥谭
A different Gotham.

551
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,550
正派  有希望
Decent, hopeful.

552
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,380
不管是什么  现在都不复存在了
Whatever it was, it's gone now.

553
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,220
萨斯来找你的时候  我该留下的
When Zsasz came for you, I should've stayed.

554
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,590
我让你走的
I told you to go.

555
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,150
那不重要  我该留下的
That doesn't matter. I should've stayed.

556
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,960
去抓住这家伙吧
Now, let's get this guy.

557
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:45,870
好的
Yeah.

558
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,430
有点迟了  布鲁斯少爷
Tad late, Master Bruce.

559
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,760
-你怎么了  -我很好
- Oi. What happened to you? - I'm perfectly fine!

560
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,020
怎么了
What happened?

561
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,920
有人侮辱我母亲
Someone spoke disrespectfully about my mother.

562
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,340
是嘛
Oh, did they now?

563
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:12,280
希望你把那混蛋打得满地找牙
Well, I hope you broke their bastard teeth for them.

564
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,130
没有
No.

565
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,780
他比我壮很多  我...
He's much bigger than me, and I...

566
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,260
我不太擅长打架
I'm not very good at fighting.

567
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,380
一点都没伤到他
Didn't hurt him at all.

568
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,820
一点都没
Not at all?

569
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:24,380
别告诉学校
Don't tell the school.

570
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,370
当然不会
Not bloody likely.

571
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,100
瞧瞧这个
Take a look at this.

572
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,490
西恩尼斯拥有半个哥谭
Sionis owns half of Gotham!

573
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,890
好吧  我们分头查
All right, we'll split up.

574
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,440
重点查被遗弃
Focus on the buildings that are abandoned

575
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,610
或正在施工的建筑
or under construction first.

576
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,940
这王八羔子别想逃掉
This son of a bitch is not getting away!

577
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,110
我就说一点  他看透了你
I'll say one thing-- he has your number.

578
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,150
-你说什么  -西恩尼斯
- What are you talking about? - Sionis.

579
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,840
你也许对科波特下不了杀手  小吉米
You may not have put down Cobblepot, Jimmy boy,

580
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,280
但是你也有心魔
but you got a demon in you.

581
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,060
你可以说自己是士兵
You can call yourself a soldier,

582
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,500
但是对抗法尔科内
but all this fighting Falcone,

583
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,280
对抗其他警察
fighting other cops,

584
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,160
你是喜欢这么做  所以如果你找到
you love it. So, when you find something

585
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,830
任何有可能的线索  联系我
that seems remotely possible, call me.

586
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,610
芭芭拉  一切都好吧
Barbara, everything all right?

587
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,580
很好  我只是
Fine. I just, uh,

588
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,380
我想问问你的情况
I wanted to check in.

589
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,770
回头聊好吗  我现在正在忙
Can we talk later? I'm kind of in the middle of something.

590
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,750
当然
Of course.

591
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,980
我爱...
I love...

592
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,760
老大要喝茶
Boss wants his tea.

593
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,100
快好了
It's almost ready.

594
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,140
哥谭市警局
GCPD!

595
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,480
还有其他人吗
Anybody else here?

596
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,950
答案
That...

597
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,060
是肯定的
would be a yes.

598
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,970
-好了  加奶加糖  -嗯
- All right, cream and sugar. - Yeah.

599
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,010
姑娘家总得购物啊
A girl's got to shop.

600
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,200
这个
This...

601
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,850
是你父亲的手表
is your father's watch.

602
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,950
可别丢了
Don't you lose it now.

603
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,570
汤米・埃利奥特家
Tommy Elliot's house.

604
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,030
别害怕
Don't you be scared.

605
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,230
我不怕
I'm not.

606
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,940
我在想象我要做的事
I'm visualizing what I'm gonna do.

607
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,690
你如果不想这么做也没什么丢人的
'Cause you if you don't want to do this, there's no shame in it.

608
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,660
那会是很丢人的
There would be immense shame in it.

609
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,530
你来干什么
What the hell are you doing here?

610
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,100
我们有未了结的事
We have unfinished business.

611
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,100
听着  如果你想告诉我父母...
Listen, if you think you're gonna tell my parents...

612
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,680
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?!

613
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,290
不许你说我妈妈
Don't talk about my mother!

614
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,670
布鲁斯少爷
Master Bruce!

615
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,250
你已经很好地表明了自己的立场
Point well made, I think.

616
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,690
你没事吧  伙计
You all right, mate?

617
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,160
断骨头了吗
Any broken bones?

618
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,980
他想杀我
He-he tried to kill me!

619
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,110
是啊
That's right.

620
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,490
的确
He did.

621
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,830
他想杀你
He tried to kill you.

622
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,220
下次你再见到他  要记住这一点
Just you remember that next time you see him.

623
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,620
同时也记住
And you remember

624
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,870
我可没拦着他
that I let him try.

625
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,670
去给手指敷敷冰吧
Now, let's get some ice on those knuckles.

626
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,590
晚饭想吃什么
What do you fancy for your dinner?

627
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,790
披萨
Pizza.

628
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,770
披萨
Pizza?

629
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,060
选得好  布鲁斯少爷
Superb choice, Master Bruce.

630
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,370
吉姆  你小子哪去了
Jim, where the hell are you?

631
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,110
我没查到东西  给我打电话
My list crapped out. Call me.

632
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,660
尼格玛  戈登没打来电话吧
Nygma, Gordon hasn't called in, has he?

633
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,600
没有  但如果警探下落不明...
No. But if the detective becomes the mystery...

634
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,580
醒醒
Wake up.

635
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,650
戈登警探
Detective Gordon?

636
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,760
醒醒
Wake up!

637
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:58,130
你们三个人来我公司申请职位
So, three of you applied for a position at my firm.

638
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,080
我解释说
I explained then

639
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,340
你们可以使用这里任何东西做武器
you can use anything here as a weapon

640
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,330
最后活着的人就能得到职位
and the last man standing gets the job.

641
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,790
但是呢
However...

642
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,190
今晚很特别
tonight is special.

643
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,660
看到那个没戴面罩的人了吗
You see the man without the mask?

644
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:16,150
杀了他的人  就算获胜
Whoever kills him... is the victor.

645
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,070
听我说
Listen to me.

646
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:18,910
我是警察
I'm a cop.

647
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,530
你们现在还没有违法
So far, none of you have broken any laws.

648
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,420
游戏...
Let the games...

649
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,620
开始
begin.

650
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,820
最后机会  都不许动
One last chance! Nobody move!

651
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,030
我还外加一百万签约奖金
And I'll throw in a million-dollar signing bonus.

652
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,010
该死
Ah, crap.

653
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,750
阿尔瓦雷斯
Alvarez.

654
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,480
帮我查查这些地址
I need help checking these addresses.

655
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,000
戈登可能有麻烦了
Gordon might be in trouble.

656
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,980
忙呢
Busy.

657
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,980
下次你老婆打电话来问你的下落
I'm gonna remember that next time your wife calls,

658
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,670
我会记住你的回答的
asking where you are, you putz.

659
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,250
柯林斯
Collins.

660
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,960
伙计  能帮帮我吗
Listen up, man, can I have some help?

661
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,600
听好了  你们这群混蛋
Now, listen up, you sons of bitches!

662
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,580
你们不喜欢戈登
So, you don't like Gordon!

663
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,260
好啊
Fine.

664
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,680
他的确挺混蛋的
He can be a total asshat.

665
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,590
但他还是个警察
But he is still a cop.

666
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,270
你们没有一个人在他需要的时候站出来帮他
And not one of you, not one, stood up when he needed it.

667
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,270
这种事不能有第二次了
That ain't happening twice.

668
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,340
我需要人帮忙查这些地址
I need help checking these addresses.

669
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,420
马上
Now.

670
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,190
给我几个
Give me a couple.

671
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,100
好吧
Okay.

672
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,940
但你会帮我跟我老婆打掩护吧
But you cover with my wife, right?

673
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,070
嗯
Yeah.

674
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,690
结束了
It's over.

675
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,330
我就知道你是个杀手
I knew you had a killer in you.

676
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,230
那么
So...

677
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,790
你的警察兄弟呢
where are your brother police?

678
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,120
他们抛弃你了吗
Did they abandon you?

679
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,340
我不需要他们
I don't need them.

680
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,250
看来那一百万要归我了
Seems I'll have to give myself the million dollars.

681
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,050
吉姆
Jim?

682
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,040
吉姆
Jim?!

683
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,010
小心
Jim!

684
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,190
谢谢
Thanks.

685
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,100
不客气
You're welcome.

686
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,140
如果我死去*
*If I die

687
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,160
灵魂也堕落*
*And my soul be lost

688
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,080
那就只能怪我自己*
*Ain't nobody's fault but mine

689
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,710
那就只能*
*Ain't nobody's fault

690
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,220
怪我自己*
*But mine

691
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,040
如果我死去*
*If I die

692
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,270
灵魂也堕落*
*And my soul be lost

693
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,930
那就只能怪我自己*
*Ain't nobody's fault but mine.

694
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,490
你来这儿最好有个好原因
You'd better have a good reason for being here.

695
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,620
拿到我要的了吗
Did you get what I asked for?

696
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,120
我想退出
I want out.

697
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,910
不行
No.

698
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,980
他会发现的
He's gonna find out.

699
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,010
或许不是今天  但很快就会的
Maybe not today, but soon.

700
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,870
这值得吗
Is it worth it?

701
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,170
你很有钱
You are rich.

702
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:10,150
大家都怕你
People are afraid of you.

703

这还不够吗
Is that not enough?

704
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,720
不
No.

705
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,150
那不够
It's not.

706
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,390
我小时候就住这附近
I grew up not too far from here.

707
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,950
只有一间卧室  没有热水
One bedroom, cold water.

708
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,510
我跟妈妈相依为命
Just me and my mama.

709
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,870
我睡在帘子后面的一张床上
I used to sleep in a bed behind a curtain.

710
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,530
妈妈招待男人的时候  我就躲在那儿
It's where I would hide when she entertained men.

711
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,860
她被杀时我就躲在那儿
And that's where I was when he killed her.

712
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,400
是法尔科内的手下
One of Falcone's men.

713
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,630
嫌她招待得不好
Didn't like the service.

714
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,500
我躲在那儿
I hid there,

715
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,580
一声没出  直到天亮
silent, until morning.

716
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,970
妈妈的尸体就在两英尺开外
With my mama two feet away from me.

717
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,710
那晚  我立誓
That night, I made a promise.

718
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,230
报仇雪恨
To get revenge.

719
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,650
再也不要软弱无力
To never again be powerless.

720
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,010
再也不许任何男人
To never let any man,

721
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:01,990
任何男人  在我之上
any man, be over me.

722
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,470
我要实现那个小女孩的誓言
This is about keeping that promise to that little girl.

723
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,270
那这是做什么的
So, what's this about?

724
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,580
这是一根线
This is a thread.

725
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,500
我一拉线  法尔科内就会倒台
I pull this and Falcone comes undone.

726
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,470
你害怕
You're scared.

727
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,360
但我不会让你出事的
But I won't let anything happen to you,

728
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,040
这我保证
and that's a promise.

729
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,830
你说
I want you to say--

730
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,580
"我相信你  妈妈"
"I believe you, Mama."

731
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,040
我相信你  妈妈
I believe you, Mama.

732
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,270
好姑娘
That's my girl.

733
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,270
你瞧  我当初做你的工作时
The thing is, when I had your job,

734
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:00,390
如果有人问我  "穆尼女士的秘密是什么"
had someone asked me, "What is Miss Mooney's secret?"

735
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,320
我会说出来的
I could've answered.

736
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,810
蒂莫西
Timothy...

737
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,140
我觉得你有所隐瞒啊
I think you're holding back on me.

738
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,390
好吧
Okay, I...

739
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,920
我可能听到她跟布奇说话了
I might've heard her with Butch.

740
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,180
说什么  说谁
Talking about what? Whom?

741
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,880
法尔科内
Fal... Falcone.

742
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,300
她说
She said, "Our...

743
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,510
"我们在法尔科内身边的朋友"
our friend with Falcone."

744
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,070
就是这样
That's it.

745
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,110
她说话声很低  求你了
She was whispering. Please.

746
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,770
她在法尔科内身边安插了人
She has someone close to Falcone.

747
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,820
当然了
Of course.

谢谢
Thank you.

749
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,990
别让人发现尸体
No one can find the body.

750
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,990
不要
No.

751
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,840
我们还在休战呢
We are at peace after all.

752
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,820
不要啊  求你
No! No, please!

753
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,640
不要
No! No...!

754
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,600
阿尔瓦雷斯和柯林斯在把西恩尼斯手下抓回来了
Alvarez and Collins are bringing in Sionis' minions.

755
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,100

Pansies tried to rabbit when they saw you cuffing their boss.

756
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,030
你没事吧
You okay?

757
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,500
艾森说你之前大发感慨
Essen told me you made a speech.

758
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,200
算不上
I wouldn't call it a speech.

759
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,950
还说你说我是混蛋
Said you called me an asshat.

760
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,610
这倒不假
I did call you that.

761
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,800
谢谢
Thank you.

762
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,130
谢谢你挺我
For having my back.

763
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,170
这次  还有之前
Now and before.

764
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,250
以后别那么讨厌了
Just try not to be such a pain in the neck.

765
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,770
让我很不好过

00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,460
你错了
You know, you were wrong.

767
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,950
你之前的话
What you said earlier.

768
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,450
我不是喜欢打
It's not that I love fighting.

769
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:34,090
但我也不害怕
But I'm not afraid to, either.

770
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,900
如果我们不为哥谭而战  还有谁会
And if we don't fight for this city, who will?

771
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,710
我不会停手的  哈维
I'm not gonna stop, Harvey.

772
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,600
法尔科内  市长  每个有问题的警察
Falcone, the mayor, every cop I know that's dirty,

773
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,800
我会抓到他们所有人
I'm gonna get them.

774
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,930
你要知道
You should know that.

775
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,330
回家吧  吉姆
Go home, Jim.

776

你今晚听我们说话了  是吧
You were listening tonight, weren't you?

777
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:11,280
你要给自己惹麻烦的  老太婆

778

我听见你跟那女孩说的故事了

779
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,450
情真意切的谎言很有力量

780
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,600
走吧  很晚了

781
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,720
吉姆来电

782

是我
