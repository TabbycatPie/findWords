29
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,480
你在做什么
What's cooking?

30
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,140
我妈传给我的菜谱  豚鼠派
My mother's recipe -- guinea-pig pie.

31
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,950
闻起来很香
Smells good.

32
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,210
你都不怀疑一下吗  其实是山核桃派
You just accept that? It's pecan.

33
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,220
你以为我们国家的人疯狂到吃豚鼠吗
How cuckoo do you think my country is?

34
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,120
我竟沦落至此
It's come to this --

35
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,700
"你在做什么"和"闻起来很香"
"What's cooking" and "Smells good"

36
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,650
都会让我挨骂
gets me in trouble?

37
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,110
妈  你现在就开始准备明天的菜了吗
Mom, you're already cooking for tomorrow?

38
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,390
你不用这么大张旗鼓
Don't make a big deal.

39
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,400
我的宝贝儿子毕业了
My baby's graduating.

40
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,180
他获得了品性正直奖
He won the award for Integrity and Character.

41
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,250
"从不旷课  从不迟到
"No absents, no tardies,

42
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,390
尊重同学及师长"
respectful to student and teachers alike."

43
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,690
我的学校当年也有这么个奖
My school had an award like that,

44
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,460
但那孩子获得的不是绶带
but instead of a sash, that kid

45
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,610
而是迎面一拳
got a punch in the mouth.

46
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,580
不过我很为你骄傲
Proud of you, though.

47
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,590
为什么你所有的故事都涉及迎面一拳
Why do all your stories involve a punch in the face,

48
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,290
一个诡异的欧洲人和一个经验丰富的骚女
a shifty European, or a broad who's been around the block?

49
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,600
这让我想起有次我揍了个意大利小子
That reminds me of when I had to rough up this Italian kid

50
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,130
因为他不想让我和他妹妹约会
because he didn't want me dating his sister.

51
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,410
那姑娘可不是乖乖女
She was no nun!

52
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,850
-杰  你帮我处理下牛排好吗  -好
- Jay, can you please take care of the steaks? ‭- Sure.

53
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,180
在你毕业大典前夜  我们吃肋眼牛排庆祝
On the eve of your big day, we're celebrating with rib eyes,

54
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,520
然后我陪你喝你第一杯威士忌
and you and I are gonna have our first scotch.

55
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,740
-真的吗  -真的
- Really?! ‭- Yeah.

56
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:54,570
我一直在等机会开这瓶典藏威士忌
I've been waiting to open a special bottle.

57
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,310
看来被老鼠偷喝了不少
Huh. Looks like the mice got into it.

58
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,750
人呢人呢  我儿子人呢
Hello, hello?! Where's my son?

59
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,660
爸
Dad!

60
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,100
他是翻大门进来的吗
What, did he hop the gate?

61
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,380
你居然来了
You came!

62
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,460
我说过我会来
I said I'd come.

63
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,020
我知道  但你居然真的来了
I know, but you came!

64
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,100
我怎能错过
How could I miss it?

65
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,140
曼尼  我们家族史上
Manny, the first member of my family

66
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,230
-第一个从高中毕业的人  -等等
- to ever graduate from high school. - ‭Wait a minute.

67
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,180
你不是有个兄弟在哥伦比亚行医吗
Don't you have a brother in Colombia who's a doctor?

68
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,000
是的
Yes.

69
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,630
他不过做些正畸手术而已
He just does orthopedic surgery,

70
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,850
又不给大脑或心脏开刀
no brain or heart.

71
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,470
想象一下  明天我会看着你
Think of it -- Tomorrow, I will watch you

72
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,420
戴着绶带昂首阔步走上领奖台
stride across the stage with a sash,

73
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,690
像个狠角色戴着弹药带
like a rebel's bandolier

74
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,810
向世界宣告"从不旷课  从不迟到"
telling the world "No absents, no tardies."

75
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,290
曼尼和我打算烤点牛排
Manny and I were gonna grill some steaks

76
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,400
再喝点  啤酒
and drink some, um, beers.

77
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,440
谢谢你  杰  但如果你不介意
Thank you, Jay, but if it's all right with you,

78
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,680
我想带曼尼出去
I would like to take Manny out

79
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,540
搞点父子间的特别庆祝活动
for a special father-son celebration.

80
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,110
我可以去吗
Is that okay?

81
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,380
当然  毕竟他费了功夫来这一趟
Ah, sure. I mean, he... made the effort to come.

82
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,940
百忙之中都不顾上系好衬衫扣子
Didn't have time to button his shirt all the way up.

83
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,820
但...  去吧
But... go ahead.

84
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,190
太棒了  夜生活现在开始
Perfect! The night begins.

85
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,350
但首先  来
But first... here.

86
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,290
从香水雨中走过去
Walk through this.

87
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,430
我知道那玩意很难闻
I know that smells terrible,

88
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,450
但我从没见过他被蚊子咬过
but I've never seen that man get a mosquito bite.

89
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,310
他在这呢  毕业生
There he is -- the graduate.

90
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,350
我只有一个词可对你说  卢克  塑料
I have one word for you, Luke -- Plastics.

91
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,640
我觉得他没看过《毕业生》  亲爱的
I don't think he knows that movie, honey.

92
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,560
{\an8}1967年电影《毕业生》中的台词

93
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,560
邓菲夫人  你这是想勾引我
Mrs. Dunphy, you're trying to seduce me.

94
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,220
好了  我们快把礼物给他好吗
Okay, let's just give him the gift, all right?

95
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,500
好  但首先  大家都聚过来
Okay, but first, gather around, everybody!

96
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,710
猜猜这个谜语
Riddle me this --

97
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,660
什么东西有两条胳膊  发条上得很紧
What has two hands, is wound tight,

98
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,370
还总是嘀嗒响[抽风]
and has a lot of ticks?

99
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,250
是艾丽克斯吗
Alex?

100
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,580
猜得好  但不是
Good guess, but no.

101
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,900
这个礼物是瑞士产的
This was made in Switzerland,

102
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,780
不是在迪士尼乐园旅馆怀上的
not in the Disneyland Hotel.

103
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,840
太棒了  一只手表
Awesome! A watch!

104
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,870
我们想早点给你
We wanted to give it to you early

105
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,570
你就能戴着它去毕业典礼了
so you could wear it to graduation today.

106
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,070
没错  这只表是防震的
Yeah. It's shockproof.

107
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,960
太好了  那它看到你的成绩就不会震惊了
Oh, good. You can show it your grades.

108
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,820
-我很喜欢  -现在什么时候了
-I love it. - What time is it?

109
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,750
是我儿子出去闯荡世界
Time for my little man to go out in the world

110
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,810
一如既往地坚韧不拔留名青史的时候了
and make his mark like the tiny trouper he used to be.

111
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,010
等一下  我去去就来
Hold on. I'll be right back.

112
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,230
我还记得他才这么小的时候
I remember when he was so small,

113
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,690
我们在洗手池里给他洗澡
we'd give him a bath in the sink.

114
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,400
又来了
Here we go.

115
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,190
爸  我们真得好好谈谈你爱哭这件事
Dad, we really got to talk about the crying.

116
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,560
我们毕业时你哭得一塌糊涂  特别丢人
When we graduated, you were a mess, and it was humiliating.

117
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,170
现代性感男性不畏惧展示感性的一面
Showing emotion is part of being a sexy modern man.

118
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,120
看艾伦·艾尔达的表演长大的人都知道
Ask anyone who was raised on Alan Alda.

119
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,120
{\an8}美国知名老演员

120
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,960
我认为我们不需要担心
I don't think we have to worry

121
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,210
他短期内是不会离家的
about him going anywhere anytime soon.

122
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,010
他刚在房间里装了小冰箱和吊床
He just installed a mini fridge and a hammock in his room.

123
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:59,840
妈  爸  你们含辛茹苦供我高中毕业
Mom, Dad, you did all the hard work getting me through high school.

124
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,320
我也该送你们一份礼物
You deserve a gift.

125
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,260
但我该送父母中的凯迪拉克什么礼物
But what do you get the Cadillac of parents?

126
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,900
一辆莱斯莱斯
A Rolls-Royce.

127
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,380
我的天
Oh, my goodness!

128
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,220
你怎么买得起
How did you afford that?

129
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,830
这车才卖两千美元
It was only $2,000.

130
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,770
俱乐部的汤普森法官带我去了警方拍卖会
Judge Thompson, from the club, got me into a police auction.

131
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,310
如果当时我还有四十美元就给你们买快艇了
If I had 40 more dollars, you'd be looking at a speedboat.

132
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,220
你们喜欢吗
So, what do you think?

133
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,800
真...  真不一般
It's... It's wow.

134
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
是吧
Right?!

135
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,780
我喜欢他一年级时用通心粉给我做的项链
I loved the macaroni necklace he made me in first grade,

136
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,690
我甚至用了他五年级时送我的香水
and I even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade,

137
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,310
但这辆车实在太俗艳了
but this car is so gaudy.

138
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,020
人们会以为我是七十年代的尼克斯队球星
People are gonna think I played for the Knicks in the '70s.

139
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,330
我从没见过这么让人感动的礼物
It's the most beautiful gesture I have ever seen.

140
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
这车百分百经典上档次
It's 100% class.

141
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,660
妈  你不是有些杂事要办吗
Hey, Mom, didn't you say you had some errands to run?

142
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,900
我本打算一会儿再出门
Oh. I -- In a little while.

143
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
是啊  但  天啊  还有皮草
Uh, s-- Yeah, but -- Um, gosh, it's got fur. Wow.

144
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,530
就好像驾驶着狮子
It's like driving a lion.

145
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,220
你走之前  按个喇叭
Hey, before you go, give us a honk.

146
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,660
好吧
All right.

147
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,800
喇叭也没好一点  是吧
The horn doesn't help, does it?

148
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,990
我把范围缩小到  瑞士咖啡白色
So, I've narrowed it down to Swiss Coffee

149
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,400
和落花白色
and Whispering White.

150
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,710
但我不知道该选磨砂漆还是光滑漆
But I can't decide between matte or satin.

151
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,010
我以为我们选定了蛋壳漆
I thought we landed on eggshell.

152
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,810
我们是决定了不用蛋壳漆
We decided against eggshell.

153
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,960
我们何不卖了这房子
W-Why don't we just sell the house?

154
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,480
咱为什么不把地刷成蛋壳漆
Why don't we just paint the floor eggshell

155
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,020
反正我们已经"如履薄蛋壳"上了
since that's what I'm walking on.

156
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,700
我忘了给你们这个
Okay. ‭I forgot to give this to you.

157
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,290
谢谢  在学校过得开心啊  亲爱的
Oh, thank you. Have a good day at school, sweetie.

158
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,190
再见  亲爱的
Bye, sweetie.

159
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,990
四年级而已  我们就只是踩水玩
It's fourth grade. We're all just treading water.

160
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,640
这是啥
What is it?

161
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,490
来自校长办公室
Ah, well, it's -- it's from the principal's office.

162
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,530
她闯祸了吗
Is she in trouble?

163
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,540
不  她很聪明
No! She's...smart.

164
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,330
-是吗  -这上面这么写的
- She is? ‭- That's what it says.

165
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,780
你确定不是给莉莉·罗森的吗
Are you sure it's not for Lily Rosen?

166
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,810
你也去了学校科学展览
You were at that science fair.

167
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,010
她救活了一只青蛙
She brought that frog back to life!

168
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,460
这是给我们的莉莉的
This is for our Lily.

169
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,250
他们建议她跳过五年级
T-They're suggesting that she skip fifth grade

170
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,830
明年直接上初中
and go right into middle school next year.

171
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,070
"经测验  莉莉远高于
"Lily is testing

172
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,540
-她所在年级的水平  -什么
- far above her grade level... ‭- What?

173
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,670
我们认为她会受益于
...and we feel she would benefit

174
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,620
更具挑战性的课程"
from a more challenging curriculum."

175
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,440
对啊  这些年我们以为她
I know! All these years we thought that she was, uh --

176
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,460
天啊  什么词来着
God, what's the word?

177
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,580
不同的  特殊的
Different? Peculiar?

178
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,620
奇怪的  毒舌的
Odd? Mean?

179
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,250
太多了  但结果她是真的很聪明
So many words. But she was just really smart.

180
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,360
她每天放学窝在房间里  不是在
Holed up in her room every day after school, she wasn't --

181
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,150
密谋灭了我们
plotting to kill us?

182
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,670
我要说的是做白日梦
I was gonna say daydreaming.

183
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,260
他们想我们有空的话今天到学校参观
They -- They want us to tour the school today if possible.

184
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,540
太让人激动了
This is so exciting.

185
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,510
我们的小宝贝是个天才
Our little baby's a genius!

186
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,680
我也跳过一级
You know, um, I also skipped a grade.

187
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,990
我不是说我是天才  但...
I'm not saying I was a genius, but --

188
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,160
那就好  因为我们现在相处融洽
Good, because we're getting along so well right now.

189
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,890
给你
Here you go.

190
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,650
-太谢谢了  -你猜怎么着
- Thanks so much. - Hey, guess what.

191
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,850
他们想让莉莉跳过五年级
They want Lily to skip fifth grade.

192
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,620
通常来说  说你猜怎么着的那个人
Traditionally, the person who says "Guess what"

193
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,820
可以负责说出谜底
also gets to say the what.

194
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,690
等下  莉莉是聪明的吗
Wait a second. Lily's smart?

195
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,200
有什么证据吗
Look. ‭I mean, there's proof of that?

196
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,460
当然  这儿有
Yeah. Right there. ‭Yes.

197
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,990
他们也让艾丽克斯跳级
They asked Alex to skip a grade, too...

198
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,200
这不是个竞赛  克莱尔
It's not a competition, Claire.

199
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,280
但我们觉得让她和年纪太大的孩子一起
...but we felt that it would be too much stress

200
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,620
会压力太大
to have her with kids so much older.

201
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,040
莉莉真了不起
Good for Lily! ‭Yeah.

202
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,550
我只是一直以为她...
I just always thought she was, you know...

203
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,160
-我们也那么以为  -我们也是
- So did we. - Yeah. Us too. Yeah.

204
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,060
你和哈维尔昨晚过得如何
How was your big night with Javier?

205
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,620
我过度放纵了
I overindulged.

206
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,550
-酒还是汉堡  -酒
- Booze or burgers? - ‭Booze.

207
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,860
我喝太多了  生气地和一人互打耳光
I drank so much, I had an angry slap fight

208
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,670
结果那人是镜子里的我
with what turned out to be a mirror.

209
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,510
是我的曼尼吗
Do I hear my Manny?!

210
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,480
你宿醉时  她的声音就像是汽车警报
When you're hungover, it's like a car alarm.

211
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,220
你好  宝贝
Ay. Hola, papi!

212
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,950
毕业快乐
Happy graduation day!

213
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,410
太舒爽了
That's delightful.

214
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,360
我需要你的毕业服套装
I need your sash and your gown.

215
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,420
我要熨一下
So that I can press it.

216
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,360
我可不想有人看起来皱巴巴的
I don't want anyone looking wrinkly.

217
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,680
我指的不是你
I don't mean you,

218
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,140
但你在这  这话还挺有意思的
but it's fun that you're right there.

219
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,680
我落在学校了  我过去一趟
I, uh, left them at school. I'll run over there.

220
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,200
妈妈  我肚子疼
Mama, I have a stomachache.

221
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,930
我的脚踝受伤了
And my ankle is broken.

222
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,200
你脚踝受伤了
And you can walk

223
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,080
还能走路吗
with your broken ankle?

224
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,660
我有个表兄靠这招逃过越战
I had a cousin got out of Vietnam that way.

225
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,330
每当曼尼
Whenever Manny's getting

226
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,590
受到很多关注时
a lot of attention,

227
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,330
乔就会装病
Joe gets very needy --

228
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,760
"我头疼"  "胳膊疼"
"My head," "My arm."

229
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,070
在哥伦比亚  我们说
In Colombia, we say,

230
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,890
"如果没流血  就闭上你豚鼠嘴巴"
"If it's not bleeding, shut your guinea-pig hole."

231
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,210
我们真的会吃豚鼠
We actually do eat guinea pig.

232
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,380
给我回电话  爸爸
Call me back, Dad!

233
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,410
紧急事件
It's an emergency!

234
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,360
怎么了
What's wrong?

235
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,940
我不知道把毕业服套装放哪了
I kind of misplaced my cap and gown and sash.

236
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,540
可能在昨晚你们去的脱衣舞俱乐部
Maybe they're at that strip club you went to last night.

237
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,800
嘘  你怎么知道
Shh! How did you know?

238
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,880
从你脸上就看得出
It's all over your face.

239
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,840
我的羞耻吗
My shame?

240
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,350
闪光粉
Glitter. ‭Ohh.

241
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,000
跟我讲讲发生了什么
Tell me what happened.

242
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,510
我们路上拿上了毕业服套装
We picked up my graduation stuff on the way, and --

243
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,760
我不知道  可能流苏让我爸想到舞女服了
I don't know. I guess the tassel got my dad thinking.

244
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,160
你们为什么不把套装放在车里
Why didn't you leave them in the car?

245
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,750
我怕被偷了
I didn't want them to get stolen.

246
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,310
而且我可能还带着套装
And I may have taken it out

247
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,610
去取悦某个叫柴娜的女子
to impress a certain Chyna with a "y."

248
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,900
我觉得她真的喜欢我
I think she really liked me.

249
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,650
我不会泼你这盆冷水的
I'm not gonna spoil that one for ya.

250
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,110
还有五个小时我就要参加毕业典礼
I graduate in five hours!

251
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,590
我们再弄一套就行
We'll get you another cap and gown.

252
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,080
几十年来所有的致辞人都穿过那套服装
That sash has been worn by every honoree for decades.

253
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,410
我不想成为丢掉毕业服的那个人
I'm not gonna be the one to lose it

254
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,320
毕竟它经历了地震  战争
after it's survived earthquakes and wars

255
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,470
还有64年的食堂肉汁大火都没事
and the lunchroom gravy fire of '64!

256
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,280
-好吧  那地方在哪  -我不知道
- Fine. Where is this place? - I don't know!

257
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,530
我记得那有很多铜管和镜子
I remember there was a lot of brass and mirrors

258
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,660
还有很吵的80年代音乐
and loud '80s music.

259
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,970
这可成功把范围缩小了啊
Well, that narrows it down.

260
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,800
等等  是在机场附近
Wait. Uh, it was by the airport.

261
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,740
好的  我们会找到的  我带你去
All right. We'll find it. I'll take you.

262
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,220
别担心  这是我们之间的小秘密
Don't worry. It'll be our little secret.

263
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,160
谢谢你  杰
Thank you, Jay.

264
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,240
这个清纯可人的小男孩到哪里去了
What happened to him?

265
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,970
我回来了
‭I'm back.

266
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,850
我们得跟你谈谈  坐下
We need to talk to you. Sit down.

267
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,790
发生什么事了
What's going on?

268
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,830
别说话
Don't say anything.

269
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,200
只管看吧
Just watch.

270
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,660
卢克婴儿时期的照片吗
Baby pictures of Luke?

271
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,230
不只是婴儿时期的照片
More than baby pictures.

272
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,910
你会一直看到长大喜欢恶俗音乐的卢克
You're gonna watch Luke grow up to sappy music.

273
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,190
你们为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

274
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,570
让你先把眼泪哭干
To get all the crying out of your system

275
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,390
这样到毕业典礼时你就不会崩溃了
so you don't melt down at the graduation.

276
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,750
就像你喝了太多酒
It's like when you drink too much

277
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,120
你朋友们把你灌得烂醉
and your friends get you super-wasted

278
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,450
于是下半周你都不想再喝酒了一样
so you never drink again for the rest of the week.

279
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,240
这是他第一次看到雪
It's the first time he saw snow.

280
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,220
拿去擦眼泪  爸爸
Oh, here, Dad.

281
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,700
谢谢
Thank you.

282
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,420
他婴儿时期盖的小被子  为什么这么对我
His baby blanket?! Why?!

283
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,310
车子很拉风哦  《灰色花园》
Hey, nice car, Grey Gardens!

284
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,310
{\an8}70年代著名纪录片  记述了一对母女的生活

285
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,190
这是我儿子送我的
It was a gift from my son!

286
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:47,800
{\an8}15分钟后回来

287
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,160
搞什么
What the hell?

288
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,570
你那算哪门子的老虎
You call that a tiger?

289
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,240
我们很自豪  拥有最先进的电脑教室
And we're very proud of our state-of-the-art computer lab.

290
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,940
感觉好怪啊  每次我走进一所中学
It's so weird -- Every time I step into a middle school,

291
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,920
我就觉得回到了14岁
I feel like I'm 14 ag-a-in.

292
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,630
是...我自己胆小  他没有要干嘛
That...was on me. He wasn't gonna do anything.

293
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,040
他看心理医生要花多少钱来着
How much is his therapy costing again?

294
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,910
我们以前觉得这是毒舌
We used to think that was snark.

295
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,520
现在我们知道了  这是智慧
Now we know it's wit. ‭Yeah.

296
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,720
彼得森先生  我们只是想确定
Uh, Mr. Peterson, we just want to be certain

297
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,150
这里的学习环境最适合莉莉
that this environment's the right fit for Lily.

298
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,310
我们对于跳级生很有经验
We have a lot of experience dealing with accelerated students.

299
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,270
但如果莉莉真的很有天分
But if Lily really is gifted,

300
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,680
那也许还有另一条路子可走  比如上私立学校
then maybe there's another path -- private schools.

301
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,890
不过  我确实很喜欢公立学校的多元化
Although, I do love the diversity of a public school.

302
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,720
-另一方面  我确实怀疑...  -行了  你知道吗
- On the other hand, I do wonder -- - Okay, you know what?

303
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,390
我们只是在考虑要不要让她跳级
We're just deciding if she's gonna skip a grade.

304
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,050
不是在规划她未来20年的人生
We're not charting out the next 20 years of her life.

305
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,050
不  选择是有后果的
Well, no, choices have consequences.

306
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,040
如果我们没选对
If we don't do this right,

307
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,400
她可能就会对学校失去兴趣  然后退学
she could lose all interest in school and drop out,

308
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,850
等我们反应过来  我们已经在养着
and the next thing you know, we're supporting her

309
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,170
她和她的废柴男友  我们的积蓄全部耗尽
and her deadbeat boyfriend and our savings are drained,

310
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,120
最终我们就得把房子卖了
and then we have to sell the house!

311
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
好了  为什么你每次崩溃
Okay, why do all your meltdowns

312
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,120
-都联想到我们要卖掉房子  -我只是说...
- have to do with us selling the house? - I'm just saying --

313
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
-你们先商量一下  好吗  -好的
- We're gonna give you guys a minute, okay? - ‭Okay.

314
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,870
莉莉  你想到电脑教室看看吗
Lily, do you want to see the computer lab?

315
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,230
现在似乎是告诉你我是被领养的好时机
This feels like a good time to tell you I'm adopted.

316
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,950
也许克莱尔说得对
Maybe Claire's right.

317
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,040
也许跳级对她来说压力太大了
Maybe it's too much pressure for her to skip a grade.

318
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,900
我也跳过级  现在不也挺好
I did it, and I'm fine.

319
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,850
不好意思  刚刚那反应是什么意思
I'm sorry. Um -- Hey, w-what does "uh-huh" mean?

320
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,880
也许你不是跳级的
Well, perhaps you're not the...best advertisement

321
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,820
最佳代言人
for skipping a grade.

322
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,670
等等  你是怕莉莉长大会变成我这样吗
So, wait. You're afraid Lily's gonna turn out like me?

323
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,540
我只是在说  也许跳级给你
I'm just saying that maybe you skipping a grade

324
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,760
带来的压力太大了
put too much pressure on you,

325
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,320
导致加剧了你的神经质倾向
and it exacerbated your neurotic tendencies,

326
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,200
现在你连鸡毛蒜皮的小事都拿不定主意
and now you can't even make a tiny, little decision

327
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,980
比如  选油漆
about, you know... paint.

328
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,130
我真的...
Wow! I can--

329
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,170
你...  我没必要站...
Y-You -- I don't have to just st--

330
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,180
你以为自己有多聪...
Oh, you think you are so s--

331
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,170
你连用何种方式愤怒退场都决定不了  对吧
You can't decide how to storm off, can you?

332
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,330
我...
I am...

333
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,880
卢克第一次剪头发
Luke's first haircut.

334
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,350
他给我剪了刘海
He gave me bangs.

335
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,290
播完了
Well, that's it.

336
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,650
希望你的眼泪已经流干了
Hopefully you're all cried out.

337
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,940
你还记不记得  他曾经把老鼠夹藏在枕头底下
You remember when he hid that mouse trap under the pillow

338
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,680
用来抓牙仙
to catch the tooth fairy?

339
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
爸爸  我们得开始准备去毕业典礼了
Dad, we got to start getting ready for the graduation.

340
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,650
是啊  要不你往脸上泼点冷水冷静下
Yeah, so maybe splash some cold water on your face

341
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,430
别哭哭啼啼了
and wrap it up.

342
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,010
你们还记得那首叫"卢克爱爸爸"的饶舌歌曲吗
Do you guys remember that "Luke Loves Daddy" rap?

343
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,490
* 我叫卢克·邓菲 *
* My name is Luke Dunphy *

344
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,240
* 我在这里要说 *
* And I'm here to say *

345
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,490
* 我爱爸爸 *
* I love Daddy *

346
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,120
你不是说到这时他就该哭完了吗
I thought you said he'd be cried out by now.

347
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,970
爸爸  拜托  你快停下吧
Dad, please, you really got to stop.

348
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,310
我扮成挠痒痒怪兽痒他时  他也说过这句话
That's what he said when I was the tickle monster!

349
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,650
妈咪  现在轮到我的牙疼了
Mama, now my tooth hurts.

350
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,670
那你今天就不能吃蛋糕啦
Well, I guess you can't have cake today.

351
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,980
那要是我疼的是腿呢
What if it's my leg?

352
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,780
克莱尔  看样子我要自己去取蛋糕了
Claire, I guess I'm picking up the cake myself,

353
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,220
因为你没回复我的短信
because you didn't answer my messages.

354
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,120
克莱尔  你在球池玩得还开心吗
Hey, Claire, are you having fun at the Gym Town?

355
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,570
其实还真的很开心
As a matter of fact, I am.

356
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,880
这位是我的新朋友  查理
This is my new friend, Charlie.

357
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
他很喜欢恐龙
He loves dinosaurs,

358
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,710
而且球池不干净  估计我们明天都会得结膜炎
and tomorrow we're both gonna have pink eye.

359
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,010
你好  查理
Hi, Charlie!

360
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,170
你能去找带你来的那个失职大人吗
Can you go and find the negligent adult that brought you here?

361
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,880
你这么快就要走了吗
Oh, do you have to go so soon?

362
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,320
他真好闻
He smells so good!

363
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,380
是啊  你再闻两口就成恋童癖罪犯了
Yeah, you're like two sniffs away from a felony.

364
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,000
到底怎么回事
What is going on?

365
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,020
我之前还嘲笑菲尔
I gave Phil such a hard time

366
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,140
为卢克的毕业典礼失落难过
for being too emotional about Luke's graduation,

367
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,900
但这事对我的冲击比我愿意承认的还大
but I think it's hitting me more than I want to admit.

368
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,710
我懂  一切都发生得那么快
I know. It happens so fast.

369
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,640
卢克小时候很喜欢来这里玩
Luke used to love coming here.

370
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,330
今天他送了我们一辆劳斯莱斯
Today he gave us a Rolls-Royce.

371
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,890
停在外面的那辆是你的吗
The one outside is yours?

372
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,570
我还以为我要见到伯特·雷诺兹了呢
I thought I was gonna be able to meet Mr. Burt Reynolds!

373
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,570
{\an8}美国老牌影星  曾持有一辆1975款劳斯莱斯银影

374
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,330
你很幸运  等曼尼走了  还有乔陪着你
You're lucky. When Manny goes, you still have Joe.

375
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,730
没错  但是这不会让离别之苦减轻半分
Yeah, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.

376
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,240
我们只能接受现实
We just have face it --

377
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,550
他们已经不是小男孩了  而是成长为了男人
They're not boys anymore. They're men.

378
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,780
卢克找到了工作  还有了女朋友
Luke has a job, and he's dating.

379
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,730
他可以加入陪审团了  老天  太可怕了
He can serve on a jury. God, that's terrifying.

380
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,240
我懂  曼尼昨晚扔下我们跑去喝酒了
I know. Manny ditched us last night to go drinking.

381
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,220
他以为我不知道  但其实我知道
He thinks I don't know, but I know.

382
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,830
他身上一股臭汗加薄荷油味
He smelled like a sweaty peppermint.

383
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,520
我看到他发给卢克的脱衣舞俱乐部的照片了
I saw the pictures that he texted Luke from the strip club.

384
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,570
哈维尔带他去了那种地方吗
Is that where Javier took him?

385
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,780
原来你不知道  抱歉
Oh. You did not know that. I'm sorry.

386
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,620
不过  不过那间看起来是比较有档次的那种
But it -- it looked like one of the classier establishments.

387
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,000
坐在曼尼大腿上的那个姑娘
The girl that was sitting on Manny's lap

388
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,340
穿了一件很漂亮的上衣
had on a really cute top,

389
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,280
至少在第一张照片上还是穿着的
at -- at least in the first picture.

390
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,940
就那么一次
The one time that I thought

391
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,710
我觉得他终于要当一个好父亲了
that he was going to be a good father,

392
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,950
结果他教曼尼怎么变成色狼
and he teaches Manny how to be a dog!

393
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,040
我要杀了他
I'm gonna kill him!

394
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,820
妈妈快看我  我要和陌生人说话啦
Hey, look at me! I'm about to talk to a stranger!

395
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,850
太好了  找到了  就是这里
Oh, yes. This is it. This is the one.

396
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,340
昨晚这儿的气氛可没这么抑郁
Ugh. It wasn't this depressing last night.

397
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,970
午餐时间的脱衣舞俱乐部
The lunch scene in a strip joint

398
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,390
会比难民营看起来更了无生机
is like a refugee camp with less hope.

399
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,830
打扰一下
Excuse me.

400
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,970
我这位朋友昨晚在这里落下了一些私人物品
Uh, my friend left some personal belongings here last night.

401
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,600
遗失物品都在这个失物招领箱里
Anything left behind, uh, goes in the lost and found.

402
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,470
谢谢
Thank you.

403
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,790
有夹克  眼镜
There's a jacket... glasses...

404
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,250
假发  希望是吧
...hairpiece, I hope...

405
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,790
-那我的东西呢  -没看到
- What about my stuff?! - Nope.

406
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,370
不过这箱子里倒是有很多婚戒
There's a lot of wedding rings in here, though.

407
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,000
先生  我们很急
Sir, we're in a big hurry.

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,940
你有见到一套毕业服套装吗
Have you seen a cap and gown and sash?

409
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,410
先生们  掌声欢迎我们的
Gentlemen, put your hands together for...

410
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,850
"逼也生"代表小姐
Val the Dictorian!

411
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,150
她看起来一定知道内情[很有文化]
She definitely looks like she knows stuff.

412
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,580
做到这样也很不错了
Credit where credit is due --

413
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,690
她在这么短的时间里想出了如此充实的表演
She put together a pretty solid act in very little time.

414
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,420
拜托你能帮我把我的东西要回来吗
Can you just please help me get my stuff back?

415
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,080
小姐
Miss?

416
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:29,050
小姐  逼也生女士
Miss? Val?

417
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,710
你好  是这样的
Hi. Heh. Here's the thing.

418
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,050
毕业服  这一整套
The gown, everything --

419
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,000
是他昨天忘在这里的
He actually left them here last night.

420
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
我当时在跟柴娜进行一场"亲密交谈"
I was having a tete-a-tete with Chyna.

421
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,500
她可能跟你提到过我  希望我没让她魂萦梦牵
She probably mentioned me. Hope I didn't lead her on.

422
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,390
我马上要去上大学了
See, I'm going to college soon, and I --

423
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,710
我不想在最后一关出差错
and I don't want any loose ends.

424
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,120
我正表演到一半
I'm in the middle of my act.

425
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,720
好的  但是他必须把毕业服拿回来
Sure, but the thing is he's got to get it back,

426
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,630
要是你能把脱下来的衣服往我们这里扔...
so if you could strip a little more in our direction...

427
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,470
我真是一团糟
I'm such a screw-up.

428
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,300
还"正直"呢
"Integrity."

429
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,900
应该写"变态酒鬼"
It should say "Perverted Schnapps Maniac."

430
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,160
老天
Oh, God.

431
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,190
闻起来一股逼也生小姐的香水味
It smells like Miss Dictorian's perfume.

432
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,770
我不能戴这个  我是个大骗子
I can't wear this. I'm a fraud.

433
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,140
"从不缺勤"  我的灵魂已经缺勤了
No absents? Oh, I've got one big absent -- my soul.

434
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,930
曼尼  你活了这么多年一直想要保持完美
Manny, you've spent your whole life trying to be perfect,

435
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,940
出了意外你很郁闷  我明白
and this is throwing you for a loop -- I get it.

436
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,930
但只要你环顾四周
But if you just look around this room,

437
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,160
就会发现人非圣贤  孰能无过
you'll realize people make mistakes.

438
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,170
你本可能犯下比昨晚更严重的错误
You could do way worse than you did last night,

439
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,450
但这都没什么
and it ain't gonna change a thing.

440
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,990
我的建议是  对自己宽容些
So my advice -- try to be a little easier on yourself.

441
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,020
谢谢你  杰
Thanks, Jay.

442
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,400
老天  是柴娜
Oh, God, there's Chyna.

443
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,610
还假装没看见我
Pretending to ignore me!

444
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,710
她跟她的透明高跟鞋一样  一眼能看穿
She's as transparent as her pumps.

445
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,540
詹姆·厄尔·卡特
James Earl Carter.

446
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,700
人家这里痛痛
Have you seen my booboo?

447
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,720
可怜的宝宝
Ohh! Poor baby! Mwah.

448
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,600
妮可·恩格里奇·科尔特斯
Nicole Ingrid Cortez.

449
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,130
麻烦让一下  我要杀个人
Can you please move over? I have to kill someone.

450
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,540
查尔斯·马克·寇森
Charles Mark Coleson.

451
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,140
希望你们昨晚玩得很开心
I hope that you had fun last night.

452
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,560
是的  真是美妙的一晚
Oh, I did. It was a magical time.

453
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,160
-露西·寇森  -真不敢相信...
- Lucy Coleson. - ‭I can't believe that you --

454
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,180
我也这么想  看看我们的儿子
Me either. Look at our son over there, eh?

455
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,310
-他真是个完美的孩子  -是的  然后你来了
- He's perfect. - ‭Yeah, and then you come along

456
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,720
-带他去...  -我
- and you expose him to all this -- - ‭Me?

457
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,080
是你带他见识到了这么多奇妙的事物
It was you who exposed him to so many amazing things.

458
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,620
你不靠我就把他育成了一个了不起的男人
You raised him to be a wonderful man without my help.

459
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,520
他身上的每一个闪光点都来源于你
Every single thing that is good about him is because of you.

460
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,390
你说什么[对不起]
I'm sorry?

461
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,180
该说对不起的是我
I'm sorry.

462
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,480
谢谢你当了我们儿子最好的妈妈
Thank you for being the finest mother to our son.

463
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,330
该死的  不用谢
Damn it. You're welcome.

464
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,760
刚才的事很抱歉
I'm sorry about earlier.

465
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,780
我不是不想让莉莉变得像你一样
It's not that I don't want Lily to be like you --

466
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,570
不  不  你说得对
No, no. Hey. You're right, okay?

467
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,010
我太优柔寡断了
I'm an indecisive mess.

468
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,750
我也不想让她在这点上像我
Of course I don't want that for her.

469
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,480
还有我得说
And for the record,

470
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,000
我也不想她变得像我
I don't want her to be like me, either.

471
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,990
不是说我过于争强好胜
Ohh! ‭It's not like I'm exactly an overachiever.

472
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,920
你就是这样没错
That's true.

473
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
你还真会就坡下驴
Yeah, you jumped on that one pretty quick.

474
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
要是你们在意我的想法
If you care about what I think...

475
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,940
-我想跳级
- ...I want to skip.

476
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,180
你确定吗  亲爱的  压力会很大的
Are you sure, sweetie? Because it's a lot of pressure.

477
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,960
-我可以应付的  -那你的朋友们呢
- I can handle it. - But what about all your friends?

478
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,360
瞧瞧那些孩子
I mean, look at -- look at these kids.

479
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,910
很多人从幼儿园就认识了
A lot of them have known each other since kindergarten.

480
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,710
我可以交新朋友  小孩们都很喜欢我
I'll make new friends. Kids really like me.

481
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,690
她很受大家欢迎吗
So...she's popular?

482
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,070
我不知道
I don't know.

483
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,170
菲尔  抱歉早先嫌弃你哭了
Phil, I'm sorry I gave you grief earlier.

484
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,420
今天对我的冲击也比我想象中大
Today has hit me much harder than I thought it would.

485
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,830
你要是有情绪也没关系
It's okay to be emotional.

486
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,300
太迟了  我眼泪哭干了
It's too late. I'm all cried out.

487
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,420
感觉我全身已经一点水分都不剩了
It's like there's no more moisture left in my body.

488
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,870
我有点害怕我要是眨眼  眼皮会黏住
I'm afraid if I blink, my eyes will get stuck.

489
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,620
真的吗
Hmm. Really?

490
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,100
你还记得那个狮子跟旧主人打招呼
Do you remember that video where the lion greets the man...

491
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,320
还紧紧抱住他  因为已经20年没见了的影片吗
...and hugs him 'cause he hasn't seen him in 20 years?

492
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,790
我当然记得啦  但我内心已死
Yep. I sure do. I am...dead inside.

493
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,870
曼尼尔·阿尔伯特·迪尔加多
Manuel Alberto Delgado.

494
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,470
太棒啦  曼尼  宝贝
Bravo, Manny! Baby!

495
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,680
小家伙  你最棒
Mwah! You did it, buddy!

496
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,900
卢卡斯·菲利普·邓菲
Lucas Phillip Dunphy.

497
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,350
宝贝  我的宝贝儿子
Whoo! My baby, my baby!

498
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
太棒了  儿子
Well done, son.

499
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,140
还记得他小时候
Remember how cute he was

500
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,080
穿着巴斯光年服的可爱模样吗
in his little Buzz Lightyear costume?

501
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,560
以及他会说"森日快乐"跟"凸书馆"
Or how he used to say "Burfday" and "Li-bary"?

502
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
他现在还会
He still does.

503
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,230
这...  我真是太难过了
This is... tearing me up.

504
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,940
恭喜毕业  兄弟
Congrats, buddy.

505
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,320
为什么你的毕业服有海莉的香水味
Why does your gown smell like Haley's perfume?

506
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,490
这游戏挺有趣对吧  不过呢
This is a fun game, isn't it? But you know what?

507
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,650
我们玩一个就坐在椅子上...
Maybe one where we just sat at a table...

508
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,310
恭喜你得到未来
Congratulations on the first

509
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,660
无数个学位中的第一个学位
of what I'm sure will be many diplomas.

510
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,190
除非你想跳过读书
Unless you want to skip all that

511
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,470
直接搬到哥伦比亚去当个放射科医生
and move to Colombia and become a radiologist.

512
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,850
谢谢你把我救出毕业服的坑
Thanks for helping me with the cap-and-gown mess.

513
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,360
要是没有你  我真不知道会怎么办
I don't know what I would have done without you.

514
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,640
我很高兴你跟你爸爸
I'm just happy you and your dad

515
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,920
昨晚享受了好玩的父子时间
got to have some father-son time last night.

516
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,750
是啊
Yeah.

517
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,620
怎么了
What?

518
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:40,460
只是我今天毕业了什么的
It's just with me graduating and everything,

519
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,010
我有点想说
I kind of wanted to say --

520
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,670
我和你今天的事情
you and me today, you know,

521
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,390
才是我觉得真正的父子时间
that's what I think of as father-son time.

522
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,410
我告诉你一件事
Let me tell you something.

523
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,500
在我当年离婚后
After my divorce,

524
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,480
我的规矩就是不交往有孩子的女人
my rule for dating was no kids.

525
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,120
然后你与你妈妈出现了
And then you and your mom came along,

526
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,060
我就把自己的规矩抛到九霄云外了
and all of that went right out the window.

527
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,700
我想说的是...
What I'm trying to say is...

528
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,160
敬你一杯  儿子
...here's to you, son.

529
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,640
我还有点宿醉
You know, I'm still kind of hungover.

530
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,180
你现在是个男人了  顶过去
You're a man now! Power through!

531
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,730
是这样的  我们很喜欢那台车
The thing is, we love the car.

532
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,380
你的心意太让我们感动了
We were so moved by the gesture.

533
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,560
太感动了
So moved.

534
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,870
我又能哭了
Hey! I'm back!

535
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,830
看来我只需要补充水分就行了
I guess I just needed to rehydrate.

536
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,080
但我们不能收下它
But we can't keep it.

537
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,450
宝贝  这礼...  这礼物太重了
Honey, it's just -- It's too generous.

538
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,040
但我这么爱你们
But I love you guys so much.

539
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,420
毕业的是你  你需要台车  送给你
You're the graduate. You need the car. It's yours.

540
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,710
我都不知道该说什么了
I don't know what to say.

541
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,870
说"果然被我料中了"如何
How 'bout "Nailed it"?

542
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,270
打从我第一眼看到那台车我就想要了
I wanted that sweet ride from the moment I saw it,

543
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,460
但我知道我爸妈绝对不会让我买
but I knew my parents would never let me get it.

544
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,190
我也知道如果我送他们  他们绝不会收
I also knew they'd never keep it if I gave it to them, so...

545
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,110
如果高考问题里
If there were any S.A.T. questions

546
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,380
有跟骗家长有关的问题   那我肯定能上大学
about tricking your parents, I'd be going to college.

547
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,490
来吧  咱们走
Come on, you guys. Let's roll.

548
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,630
你们这么快要走啦
You guys leaving already?

549
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,680
对啊  我们都有安排了
Yeah, we all have plans.

550
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,830
等等  莉莉
Wait. Lily?

551
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,560
如果我不出现在珍娜家
There are nine girls who will freak

552
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,280
会有九个小女孩想我到发疯
if I don't make an appearance at Jenna's.

553
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,750
我不懂  她是很好玩还是怎么
I'm confused. I-Is she fun?

554
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,980
来吧
Come on.

555
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,870
好车
Ooh, nice ride!

556
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,570
再见啦
Bye-bye!

557
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,400
-回头见  -再见啦
- See ya later! - Bye!

558
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,850
-再见  -再见
- Bye! - Bye!

559
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,310
天啊  卢克在开车
Oh, my gosh! Luke is driving!

560
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,200
他们甜点都还没吃就跑了
They didn't even stay for dessert!

561
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,690
天啊  他们真的走了
Oh, God. They're really gone.

562
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,050
好伤心
It's so sad.

563
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,640
但我们不就一直期待这这天吗
But isn't it what we hoped for?

564
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,530
-是啊  -是
- Yeah. - Yeah.

565
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,890
敬一杯
A toast.

566
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,130
我们把他们养育成独立的人
We raised them to be independent,

567
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,090
现在他们要步入社会  开始自己的人生
and now they're out in the world having their own lives.

568
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:33,930
我们成功了
We did it.

569
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,180
-敬一杯  -敬我们
- Salud! ‭- To us!

570
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,470
抱歉错过刚才那段
Oh, sorry I missed the first part,

571
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,880
但你们敬什么事我都愿意喝一杯
but I'll drink to whatever you're toasting.

572
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,840
给我加点酒
Top me off!

573
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,140
你在干嘛
Uh...what are you doing?

574
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,490
我在寻找
Well, I'm just trying to see

575
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,410
还有什么我们不知道的关于莉莉的事
if there's anything else about Lily we haven't noticed.

576
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,840
比如...  她打高尔夫吗
Like -- she plays golf?

577
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,660
她打我们会知道的  打球还要球场费啊
No, we would know. Aren't there greens fees?

578
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,070
这个呢
And what about this? ‭Huh?

579
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,530
《甜蜜的生活》
"La Dolce Vita"?

580
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,060
她喜欢意大利老片吗
She likes Italian films?

581
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,100
难怪她会觉得
Well, no wonder she thought

582
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,020
动画片《冰河时代5》很无聊
Collision Course" was boring.

583
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,990
我喜欢啊
I liked it.

584
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,050
再来看看还有什么
Okay. What else?

585
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,940
莉莉跟州长握手的照片
A photo of Lily shaking hands with the governor?!

586
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,030
什么  什么时候
What? When?!

587
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,120
好  我们得多加关注她了
Okay, maybe we need to start paying more attention.

588
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,970
俗话说  没坏就别...
Or if it ain't broke...

589
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,480
-...硬修了  她没事的  -挺好的
- Yeah, she's fine. - ‭She's fine.

590
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,630
仅纪念Roy Rodriguez[曼尼真实的父亲在2017/3/12去世]
