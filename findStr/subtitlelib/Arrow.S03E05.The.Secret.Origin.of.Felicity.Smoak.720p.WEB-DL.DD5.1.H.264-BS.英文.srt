16
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,810
My name is Oliver Queen.

17
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,020
After five years in hell,

18
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,360
I have come home with only one goal--

19
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,480
to save my city.

20
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,650
Now others have joined my crusade.

21
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,870
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

22
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,790
To the rest of starling city,

23
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,390
I am someone else.

24
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,620
I am something else.

25
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,140
Previously, on "Arrow"...

26
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,660
There's a lot of good people, they lose someone,

27
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,220
they lose themselves,

28
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,390
which is why they come in here to work off that rage.

29
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,500
Roy, are you ok? You look a little tired.

30
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,390
I just haven't been sleeping much lately.

31
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,160
If I had accepted my life, I would be a cocktail waitress

32
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,280
in Vegas like my mother,

33
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,300
and I never would have believed some crazy guy in a hood

34
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,720
when he told me I could be more than just some IT girl.

35
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,090
You're not moving very quickly this morning.

36
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,640
I just didn't sleep much last night.

37
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,400
You're not boxing, girl.

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,700
You're not even fighting.

39
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,720
You're just lashing out. Come on!

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,990
Impressive.

41
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,600
How do normal people spend their morning?

42
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,930
Eight, nine...

43
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,550
Come on, ladies, we are almost there...

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,010
And ten.

45
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,670
- Five. - Good, very good.

46
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,880
Yes!

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,510
Mrs. Fernandes!

48
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,770
I already told you, I haven't seen

49
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,530
your...cat.

50
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,020
I haven't seen him, either.

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,770
Or is the cat a girl?

52
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,690
Was I being misogynist just now?

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,160
Or is it misogynistic? I never know.

54
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,260
Ray...what are you--

55
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,070
Nice place you've got here. Lots of space.

56
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,590
So it occurred to me this morning,

57
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,470
What's the one thing that Queen Consolidated has

58
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,380
that we don't use to its maximum potential?

59
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,390
A doorbell?

60
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,170
Have you heard of a process called cogeneration?

61
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,690
I haven't even looked at a cup of coffee yet.

62
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,280
- Well, cogeneration is-- - The repurposing

63
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,800
of waste heat given off by electricity production.

64
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,370
Exactly. It's a principle of thermodynamic efficiency,

65
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,550
which occurred to me could be applied to a building

66
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,510
which generates over 240,000 watts of electricity.

67
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,380
Like Queen Consolidated.

68
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,510
I did some preliminary calculations on the drive over.

69
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,750
You want to sell QC's excess energy back to the city?

70
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,990
If by "Sell" you mean "give away for free," then yes.

71
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,120
Energy is something that should be given freely to the masses.

72
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,460
Uh, you still haven't found Mrs. Fernandes' cat, I'm guessing.

73
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,830
Oh, my beautiful girl!

74
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,410
Very friendly with your neighbors, I see.

75
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,100
- Mom... - Mom?

76
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,250
What are you doing here?

77
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,870
Honey, I came to see you.

78
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,520
For a visit. Look, look, look.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,210
Didn't you get my text?

81
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,240
Mom, to send a text, you actually have

82
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,530
to press "Send" on the text.

83
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,100
Oh, ok, not a big deal, I'll do it right now.

84
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,510
Are you adopted?

85
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,530
Oh! I'm so sorry. I didn't know you had somebody staying over.

86
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,820
Oh, no, he's not staying over.

87
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,870
He's not, like,

88
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,550
we're not-- this is my boss.

89
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,110
It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Smoak.

90
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,960
Hi. You can call me Donna.

91
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,800
- Mom... - I'm Ray.

92
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,820
Oh, my god. Palmer?

93
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,530
You're that watch guy.

94
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,430
We like to call them smart wearables.

95
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,370
I bought one of your watches! Look!

96
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,820
See? Felicity here thinks I don't

97
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,860
pay attention to all of her tech-y things.

98
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,850
Yeah, I see you've got a 3GS.

99
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,460
I'm actually wearing a prototype for the new six.

100
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,340
Yeah, it basically replaces your computer.

101
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,860
- Very fancy. - You know what? It's yours.

102
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,250
Oh, no. Seriously?

103
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,100
I'll let you two catch up.

104
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,010
Let me know what you think about those cogeneration numbers,

105
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,470
and Donna, hope to see you again soon.

106
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,310
Well, don't count on it. She'll probably be really busy...

107
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,740
planning my funeral after I die of embarrassment.

108
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,590
"You are standing in an open field

110
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,300
"west of the White House

111
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,120
with a boarded front door."

112
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,110
What are you doing?

113
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,860
I just finished coding a Linux emulator for Zork.

114
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,680
"It is pitch black.

115
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,260
"You are likely to be eaten... by a grue."

116
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,710
I guess you'll have to protect me.

117
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,650
Why can't you just quietly have sex under a comforter

118
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,410
like most college students?

119
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,500
You found an exploitable note?

120
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,440
Now I just need your super computer virus to crack the firewall.

121
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,140
I really wish you wouldn't call my X-axis bi-numeric algorithm

122
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,460
a "Super-virus."

123
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,490
Spoofing the IP, switching to MD6, and...

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,360
Somebody take a screenshot. We have to post this to hackerforum,

126
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,010
to brag that we actually got in!

127
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,420
Hold on. 30 seconds until the firewall goes back up.

129
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,010
Cooper, what are you doing?

130
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,200
I think the world would be a much better place

131
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,720
if there weren't any student loans, don't you?

132
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,310
You can't wipe out all the loans,

133
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,630
they'll never think it's a glitch.

134
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,150
They're going to track us down and find us!

135
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,860
- 10 seconds. - Cooper!

136
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,360
I'm not going to jail for you, Cooper,

137
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,660
and you shouldn't, either.

138
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,330
Coop!

139
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,600
- I almost had it! - What were you thinking?!

140
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,860
Ever heard of hacktivisim?

141
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,310
Instead of posting to web forums,

142
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,820
we could be doing some real good in the world.

143
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,120
And going to prison in the process.

144
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,200
It's all about what you want to be when you grow up, babe,

145
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,270
a hacker, or a hero?

146
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,330
Hello?

147
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,870
Speedy?

148
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,120
Just signed the lease.

149
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,450
What do you think?

150
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,190
Thea, you're signing a lease on a spot

151
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,830
that you can't possibly afford.

152
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,910
- I can, actually. - With whose money?

153
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,350
Malcolm Merlyn's. His estate, I mean.

154
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,110
When I left Starling City, I mentioned something

155
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,460
to Ned Foster about Malcolm being my father,

156
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,250
and there's a lot of legal stuff I didn't understand, and--

157
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,550
He left you money?

158
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,670
The entire world thinks he's dead.

159
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,830
So, yes, legally, his estate

160
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,160
goes to his last living heir.

161
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,300
And last week when you told me

162
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,150
that you had investors for the club, that was a lie?

163
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,240
I was afraid you wouldn't react well

164
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,970
to the idea of me taking his money.

165
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,220
It's blood money, Thea!

166
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,890
You don't know what Malcolm Merlyn is capable of!

167
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,210
I know what his money is capable of,

168
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,850
renting me this really sweet loft.

169
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,070
Listen to me. He's alive,

170
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,180
and if you take his money, he has a hold on you.

171
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,050
I think you're being a little melodramatic.

172
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm his daughter, ok? He's not going to put me in danger.

173
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,520
He's responsible for the death of 503 innocent people,

174
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,140
including your brother.

175
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,610
Now that is a card that you do not get to play.

176
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,660
You are my brother,

177
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,100
but that does not mean you have the right to tell me

178
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,960
what I can do with my life.

179
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,300
I am my own person.

180
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,060
The movers are coming tomorrow,

181
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,660
so you can stop by with popcorn

182
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,860
or not stop by at all.

183
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,320
Oh, please.

184
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,060
What is going on?

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,230
Ollie?

186
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,090
You ok?

187
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,720
We are Brother Eye.

188
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,840
Judgment has been rendered against this city.

189
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,830
Its sentence carried out.

190
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,780
An earthquake. A siege.

191
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,590
This is what comes next,

192
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,230
a new life you will live on your knees,

193
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,920
and it will take nothing more than a push of a button.

194
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,280
We are in control now.

195
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,440
And this is just the beginning.

196
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,190
Let there be light.

197
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,810
Oh, a nightclub.

198
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,560
You know, I'm really not dressed for a nightclub.

199
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,630
- Really? - You think?

200
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,820
My friend owns the place. He just needs

201
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,970
a little help turning the power back on, so,

202
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,730
why don't you... come, come.

203
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,190
- Stay put. - Stay here?

204
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,250
- Right here. - Ok.

205
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,700
Hey. Any luck tracking this--

206
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,830
Hello.

207
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,290
Hi.

208
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,670
Please tell me this is your friend.

209
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,340
- No. Mom, this is Oliver - Queen.

210
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,840
Very nice to meet you.

211
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,240
Yes, it's so nice to meet you, too.

212
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,010
How many billionaires do you know?

213
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,850
Diggle, meet Felicity's mom.

214
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,760
Mom. John Diggle.

215
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:12,500
Hi. Very nice to meet you.

216
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,800
Nice to meet you, too. Oh! Hello!

217
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,510
Who is this little nugget?

218
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,760
This is my daughter Sara.

219
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,070
- Mom. Mom. mom! - What?

220
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,970
We have to go downstairs.

221
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,210
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to stop you.

222
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,620
I'm so sorry. Little baby moment. So sorry.

223
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,770
It's great to meet you, finally.

224
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,870
Yes, yes, definitely.

225
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,690
Why is Sara here?

226
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:36,100
Lyla's on an assignment in Santa Prisca

227
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,660
and the nanny called in sick.

228
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,060
But we can't bring her down there.

229
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,900
Why not, Oliver, who's she gonna tell?

230
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,090
Well, she,

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,860
I'm not comfortable with her down there.

232
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,400
God help me.

233
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,160
My mother loves babies. Just...

234
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:55,690
Really?

235
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,040
Whoever this Brother Eye group is, somehow got access

236
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,380
to the city's protected network

237
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,280
and uploaded a system-wide virus.

238
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,590
Any way to trace it?

239
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,810
No, it deleted itself as soon as

240
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:04,700
it completed its task.

241
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,430
They said the power outage was just the beginning.

242
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,500
Then let's find them before there's a next time.

243
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,930
Hey, Laurel, are you all right? Did you get here ok?

244
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,320
I'm fine. I was close.

245
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,210
But why do I get the Emergency Services Alert?

246
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,480
Why don't they call the district attorney?

247
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,360
Cause he's visiting his niece in Coast City.

248
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,760
You are the acting district attorney. Congratulations.

249
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,000
Hello, detective, captain.

250
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,310
Look, you're on this Brother Eye thing, right?

251
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,810
- We are. - Good,

252
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,890
cause there's no one here knows computers better than you.

253
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,710
No, for the last time,

254
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,130
I am not interested in buying a fake ID.

255
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,160
I am hanging up now. Bye.

256
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,170
My mom says hi.

257
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,860
You still angry at me?

258
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,090
I was past the firewall and into the account network.

259
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,380
I had 3,000 debts wiped

260
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,780
by the time you pulled the plug on me.

261
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,550
Well, think of how many accounts you could go to prison for

262
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,890
if I hadn't stopped you.

263
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,060
Relax.

264
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,480
The DNS wasn't configured.

265
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,940
They can't backtrace me.

266
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,340
They can. The subroot was configured.

267
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,800
By accessing the accounts,

268
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,600
you set off a packets feedback that anyone could trace back to.

269
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,340
You are gorgeous when you're being a chicken.

270
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,870
- I'm serious. - I'm serious.

271
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,360
Cooper Seldoel that's enough! Don't move!

272
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,490
- You are under arrest. - What?!

273
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,150
No! Let go of me.

274
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,820
No, no, no!

275
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,920
- You're under arrest for violation - Cooper!

276
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,770
- of U.S. Code title 18, section 1030. - No. Don't!

277
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,140
You have the right to remain silent.

278
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,050
Let go of him, let him go!

279
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,730
We said this was just the beginning.

280
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,210
Electricity is not the only power in the city.

281
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,140
Consider money, for example.

282
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,230
The banks are next to go dark.

283
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,200
Your beloved dollars wiped away

284
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,420
as your accounts will finally all be equal,

285
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,840
at zero.

286
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,400
Felicity...

287
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,660
I'm working on it. I set up some trace IP packets

288
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,270
before brother eye's last broadcast.

289
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,140
As soon as he opened up the channel,

290
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,100
I scooped up the bread crumbs.

291
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,720
Bread crumbs we can follow?

292
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,670
I hope so.

293
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,630
Where's Captain Lance?

294
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,800
Coordinating squad car patrols for dispatch.

295
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,280
Why? What's wrong?

296
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,110
There's a situation at Starling National.

297
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,800
Send in an ESU squad.

298
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,580
Sorry, ma'am, but you don't have the power to--

299
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,250
I'm acting district attorney.

300
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,130
The City Charter gives me operational authority in times of crisis,

301
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,420
which this clearly is.

302
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,550
I'm not letting anyone get hurt.

303
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,110
Send in an ESU now.

304
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,440
What's going on?

305
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,380
SCPD just dispatched a riot squad to Starling National.

307
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,100
It's like fighting a fire with gasoline.

308
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,790
Suit up.

309
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,880
This group is ordered to disperse!

310
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,490
Get back!

311
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,140
Behind the line!

312
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,470
Oliver, the riot is getting out of control.

313
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,830
You need to hurry up.

314
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,470
Get away from the bank!

315
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,560
The teargas is dispersing them,

316
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,830
but we can't calm the entire city, Felicity.

317
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,520
The trace led me to the virus they're using.

318
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,650
It is a mile past complex.

319
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,940
I'm coming through now.

320
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,970
No, no, no, no, no, no!

321
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,230
What's wrong?

323
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,820
The virus... I can't stop it!

324
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,610
How do you know?

325
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,890
Because it's mine.

326
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,080
I wrote it five years ago.

327
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,840
Ok, ok, before you say anything,

328
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,120
just know that I never imagined the virus

329
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,860
being used for something like this.

330
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,120
I mean, sure, I could have imagined it.

331
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,620
I actually have a very vivid imagination.

332
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,420
Like cronuts!

333
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,950
I had a vision of them before--

334
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,210
Relax. Take a deep breath.

335
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,810
Good.

336
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,180
Now start at the beginning.

337
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,980
I was in this,

338
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,470
I guess you could call it a group,

339
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,160
in college.

340
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,630
We were "hacktivists."

341
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,440
For lack of a better word.

342
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,930
Civil disobedience via the world wide web.

343
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,170
I created this.

344
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,460
This

345
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,610
super virus.

346
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,540
That could give us root access to any infected server.

347
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,130
We could expose government fraud

348
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,640
and start virtual sit-ins

349
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,650
and digitally deface criminals.

350
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,350
I guess you could say it was my first attempt at being a hero.

351
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,960
Felicity.

352
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,200
Why didn't you tell me about any of this?

353
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,820
Do we even know a fraction

354
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,270
of what happened to you the five years that you were away?

355
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,670
Who else had access to the program?

356
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,450
Myron Forest. He was my...

357
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,540
I had a boyfriend in college,

358
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,980
And Myron was his roommate.

359
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,170
And he was a member of this hacktivist group?

360
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,290
What about the boyfriend?

361
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,170
Oh, he couldn't have done this.

362
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,440
He's...not in the picture,

363
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,520
but Myron always had somewhat of an edge.

364
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,590
Can you get me an address?

365
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,760
Sure.

366
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,120
Just one small problem--

367
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,710
not small, necessarily, but short.

368
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,430
Just take the alleyway entrance.

369
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,140
Are you ok?

370
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,680
I've been better.

371
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,990
I talked it over with Myron,

372
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,630
and I'm going to tell them I wrote the super virus.

373
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,750
You can't do that.

374
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,170
I can't let you rot in prison, Coop.

375
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,330
You can't tell them you wrote that virus...

376
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,830
cause I already told them I did.

377
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,660
Cooper...

378
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,200
I always said I'd protect you from the grues.

379
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,630
- This isn't-- - It's better this way.

380
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,430
I wiped out those loans.

381
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,750
There's no reason both of us should be in prison.

382
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,210
I love you.

383
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,330
Love you, too.

384
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,230
Hey. Got a minute?

385
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,200
Congratulations, you called in a riot squad,

386
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,370
you nearly started one! And! You did it behind my back.

387
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,500
You were busy,

388
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,070
and the situation at Starling national was escalating.

389
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,090
You escalated it, Laurel!

390
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,250
Please tell me you can at least see that now.

391
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,340
Ok.

392
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,190
I'm sorry.

393
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,880
Laurel, baby...

394
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:25,730
What's gotten into you?

395
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,960
You're angry, you're distant, you're reckless.

396
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,780
Tell me you're not boozing again.

397
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,940
No.

398
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,650
Then what the hell's going on? Because this isn't you.

399
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,710
Look, I haven't said anything

400
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,780
because I was hoping that you would say something,

401
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,190
Because you, sweetheart, you are in ten different kinds of pain,

402
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,940
and you won't talk about it.

403
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,570
I can't talk about it with you.

404
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,810
Ok. But listen, you don't have to talk about it with me.

405
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,310
But talk about it with somebody.

406
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,880
Cause secrets hurt, baby.

407
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,840
Sometimes more than the truth.

409
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,480
Back-up generator keeps that locked.

410
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,630
Or...so they told me.

411
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,090
I could never get that stupid door to open.

412
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,920
Contractor says the entire sub level is flooded, though.

413
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,460
It was a water main break.

414
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,510
What are you doing here, Ollie?

415
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,470
A super hacker is trying to

416
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,260
take over the city and I'm worried about you.

417
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,930
I still get to be worried, right?

418
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Yes. And if you really have to,

419
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,270
you can even be judgmental--

420
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,980
occasionally.

421
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,690
Someone told me recently

422
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,590
that a family is pretty precious.

423
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,510
And love, in spite of everything,

424
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,200
is what makes it precious.

425
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,600
Right now, the Queen family is just you and me.

426
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:58,350
So let it just be you and me.

427
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,800
And don't take Merlyn's money.

428
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,350
I'm trying to meet you halfway here, Ollie.

429
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,870
The other half is up to you.

431
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,060
Myron Forest.

432
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,250
You have failed this city.

433
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,420
Tell him he has to retract all the infected packets

434
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,460
from subsystem mainframes within the city.

435
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,340
Tell me how to shut down the virus.

436
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,870
Do it now.

437
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,810
You think I'm behind the cyber attacks?

438
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,230
Sounds like a Brother Eye to me.

439
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,710
I swear to god, I'm not.

440
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,890
I head up the IT department of an accounting firm.

441
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,810
I drive a hybrid. It's blue.

442
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,710
I'm one of the sheep lunatics like these guys hate.

443
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,830
Why would I do this?

444
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,110
Digital fingerprints are all over this code.

445
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,560
There's an x-axis bionumeric algorithm.

446
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,600
The code's an x-axis

447
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,540
bionumeric algorithm that you've used before!

448
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,060
In college.

449
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,040
My roommate and his girlfriend.

450
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,760
Yeah, yeah, sure, we developed it.

451
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
We called it a super virus,

452
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,680
but that doesn't mean I'm the Eye guy!

453
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,170
Have you tried Felicity Smoak?

454
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,580
She's innocent.

455
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,220
Then it's got to be someone else.

456
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,600
After we graduated, I might have showed

457
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,080
the code off to a few people.

458
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,090
- Who were they?! - I don't remember.

459
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,940
It was five years ago. I didn't think it was a big deal.

460
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,090
We were just kids playing with matches.

461
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,820
I am running out of expletives!

462
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,990
We need to track down whoever Myron shared your code with.

463
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:41,460
I hacked all of his emails

464
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,100
and all his text messages from five years ago

465
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,510
and all I got was depressed.

466
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,350
Ok. What about your ex?

467
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,970
I already told you, he didn't do it.

468
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,930
Why? Because he's your ex-boyfriend?

469
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,090
Because...

470
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,910
my senior year of college,

471
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,090
Cooper and I did a stupid thing.

472
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,470
He got arrested and he went to prison.

473
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,660
So he went to prison. Maybe he got out.

474
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,790
He didn't.

475
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,320
How do you know?

476
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,720
Because he's dead.

477
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,560
He hung himself before sentencing.

478
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,810
Felicity, I...

479
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,860
I just really need to be alone right now.

480
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,710
I'm glad you're here.

481
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,800
When I launched my plan to rebrand

482
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,670
Starling into Star City,

483
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,280
I didn't count on cyber terrorism.

484
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,220
I'm looking for a partner

485
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,440
with whom to drown my sorrows and you

486
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,000
definitely look like someone who could use a drink.

487
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,600
I'm sorry.

488
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,120
My mother...

489
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,880
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

490
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,560
You ok?

491
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,750
You're an inventor.

492
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,820
Did you ever create

493
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,880
anything that you didn't think was important,

494
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,010
turns out,

495
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,640
it's very important?

496
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,540
Of course.

497
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,870
Those turn out to be the best inventions.

498
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,130
Not always.

499
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,020
You want to talk about it?

500
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,150
Of course I'd find you here.

501
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,850
- Could you just wait one second? - Wait?

502
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,240
I'm sorry; i've already waited two hours for you at your apartment,

503
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,940
and before that, it was two hours in the club.

504
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,990
Is there any way that you could be anywhere else but here?

505
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,680
Thanks, mom.

506
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,990
That wasn't the least bit mortifying.

507
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,620
Only half as bad as parents' week in freshman year.

508
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,070
Oh, I'm sorry.

509
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,920
I'm sorry I've been reduced to stalking my own daughter.

510
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,490
Because you can't seem to comprehend that

511
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,320
I can't make the whole world stop

512
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,580
because you decided to show up on my doorstep.

513
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,630
I have responsibilities!

514
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,290
Yes, I know, Felicity.

515
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,500
You have work. You have work, work, work, work.

516
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,400
No, no, no, you don't understand.

517
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,770
It is so much more than work.

518
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,850
But all you care about it my love life

519
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,020
or how much cleavage I don't show.

520
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,240
That is not true!

521
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,710
That is completely true!

522
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,960
And I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I'm terminally single.

523
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm sorry I have an actual job.

524
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,590
I'm sorry that I don't dress like a porn star!

525
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,990
Which I realize is a compliment to you.

526
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,350
So I'm so sorry

527
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,880
that I am such a disappointment to you!

528
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,670
I'm not as smart as you, Felicity,

529
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,950
or your father.

530
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,900
I know that.

531
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,010
Even when you were only six years old,

532
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,870
I could barely keep up with you two.

533
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,070
And...

534
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,440
Maybe I wasn't always the mother you wanted,

535
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,180
but I was always there.

536
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,790
I stayed and I tried.

537
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,790
He...

538
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,080
he left me.

539
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,480
He left us.

540
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,250
But when I look at you,

541
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,290
all I see is what he gave you.

542
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,190
There is nothing of me...

543
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,480
in you.

544
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,700
You know, it's so funny. I was--

545
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,090
I was always so afraid that one day,

546
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,960
you were going to leave me, too.

547
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,760
But now I finally realize...

548
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,200
you already did.

550
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,570
There are people on the other end of this thing, right?

551
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,750
People we can hit?

552
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,460
We need Felicity.

553
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,190
I'm here.

554
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,190
The super virus has 3,407 traceable access notes.

555
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,250
Hopefully I didn't put a firewall in every one, though.

556
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,770
Of course I did, because I'm smarter than that.

557
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,460
Seriously, if I had two less IQ points,

558
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,330
we never would have gotten in this mess.

559
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,570
Are you all right?

560
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,640
- Where's your mom? - I don't know.

561
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,290
Probably back at my place,

562
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:26,120
wishing she had a different daughter. It's a long story.

563
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,570
So go see her. Take an hour.

564
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,670
The city is under attack.

565
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,090
You're our best chance of stopping it,

566
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,210
but not like this, Felicity.

567
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,870
Your head's not in the game.

568
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,910
I will get it together.

569
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,350
Your tracer hack's running.

570
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,390
Take an hour. Go talk to your mom.

571
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,690
I do not have anything to say to her.

572
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,790
You know, earlier today, Thea told me that

573
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:46,260
she literally has to put up with me

574
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,070
because family is precious.

575
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,220
And that it's love,

576
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,420
in spite of everything,

577
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,820
that makes it precious.

578
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,130
Go.

580
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,670
Where's Sara?

581
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,370
The nanny came to pick her up.

582
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,100
Said he was from a company called A.R.G.U.S.

583
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,710
I don't know, I've never heard of it.

584
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,320
I think that's the point.

585
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,300
Well, I'm glad you're still here.

586
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,240
You are a terrible liar, Felicity.

587
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,720
Might be the only thing we have in common.

588
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,670
I have blonde hair.

589
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,860
You dye it.

590
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,680
You're right.

591
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,500
We're different, and it's always going to be that way.

592
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,390
And it's not easy--

593
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,160
No, you know what, it's--

594
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,600
it's totally my fault for just showing up here uninvited.

595
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,690
Seriously. I think I just got so excited about this free flight.

596
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,380
What?

597
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,350
My plane ticket.

598
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,550
I got an email that said I'd won some contest.

599
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,860
Free first class round trip to Starling.

600
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,940
Email?

601
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,220
Mom.

602
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,800
Someone wanted you to be here.

603
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,270
Mom!

604
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,950
- Baby! - Mom!

605
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,000
- Are you ok? - I'm ok.

606
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,520
Oh, thank god!

607
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,310
Where are we?

608
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,950
Felicity Smoak, just the woman I wanted to see.

609
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,500
What the hell do you want from me?!

610
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,610
Who are you?

611
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,140
You really don't know?

612
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,800
I thought you'd never forget your first love.

613
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,180
You died.

614
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,110
- They told me-- - That I committed suicide, right?

615
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,330
The N.S.A. needed a hacker with game for cyber espionage,

616
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,370
and I needed to not be in prison

617
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,820
for the rest of my life.

618
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,410
Because of what the N.S.A. wanted me doing, it was...

619
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,890
advantageous for me to be dead.

620
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,730
When I found out you died,

621
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,010
I was devastated.

622
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,760
I loved you.

623
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,290
I loved you, too.

624
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,470
After I finished my time with the N.S.A.,

625
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,890
I was going to find you.

626
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,840
To let you in on this.

627
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,610
And then I discovered you'd become this corporate

628
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,600
lap dog.

629
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,440
Broke my heart. You changed.

630
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,830
If you ever thought I was capable of doing something like this,

631
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,370
you never really knew me at all.

632
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,030
When you wrote this virus, Felicity,

633
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,590
you knew exactly what it was capable of.

634
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,720
All I'm doing is unleashing the true potential

635
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,650
of what you made.

636
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,770
Why?!

637
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,950
This isn't who you are!

638
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,040
Five years with the N.S.A.,

639
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,790
you learn a lot about how the world works.

640
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,370
How we can't be saved or salvaged.

641
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:00,480
How it's every man for himself.

642
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,010
You also learn that when a city bank goes under,

643
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,780
say, financial cyber attack,

644
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,170
the mayor will reach out to the Treasury Department

645
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,760
and request an influx of fresh cash.

647
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,550
Cash which is transported by armored trucks.

648
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,390
Navigating according to a closed-end G.P.S. system,

650
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,720
which directs them to city deposit.

651
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,280
If the drivers deviate from the route,

652
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,860
The trucks are shut down.

653
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,820
But you're going to hack into the system

654
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,150
and direct the cash to come here.

655
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,470
It was about money, and I'm the sell-out?

656
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,540
No.

657
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,690
No, babe.

658
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,270
You're the one who's going to help me.

659
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:41,680
See, breaking into the Treasury's asymmetric encryption

660
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,570
is beyond even my capabilities.

661
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,790
I'm going to politely decline.

662
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,860
Don't!

663
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,220
That's why I flew some motivation into town for you.

664
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,190
She's been MIA for over an hour.

665
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,790
Well, you did tell her to go home.

666
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,830
I just had an A.R.G.U.S. agent

667
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,630
pick up Sara there.

668
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,480
I could have them go back, check things out.

669
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,410
Yep.

672
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,650
Felicity's never more than five feet from her phone.

673
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,680
Something's wrong.

675
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,910
No! No!

676
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,180
That terminal's configured to only connect with the Treasury's IP.

677
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,170
I mention this so you don't try to do anything stupid,

678
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,640
like alert the police.

679
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,070
I'm so sorry.

680
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,870
Mom...

681
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
right now's not really the best time, ok?

682
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,020
But it might be the last time, hon,

683
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,370
And I want you to know

684
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,100
that all I've ever wanted...

685
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,250
is for you to be happy.

686
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,760
Let's say we hit pause on the Dr. Phil episode.

688
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,970
It's done! It's done.

689
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,340
That quick?

690
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,910
There's a reason you wanted me, right?

691
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,270
They'll be at your front door in five minutes.

692
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,510
- Guards will be armed. - Let's go.

693
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,730
Stay put, ok?

694
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,220
Just because we used to screw

695
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,310
doesn't mean I won't use this gun.

696
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,490
What's that?

697
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,610
Huh?

698
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,200
Oh, that, that's the watch.

699
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,970
It's the watch Mr. Palmer gave me.

700
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,900
It chimes on the hour, and I guess we're about to be killed.

701
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,190
We're not going to be killed.

702
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,670
We're going to get out of here.

703
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,510
It basically replaces your computer.

704
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,030
You know I don't know what that means.

705
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,740
It means it has wifi.

707
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,020
Really?

709
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,220
When they're in range...

710
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,210
You know what to do.

711
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,950
I did what you wanted.

712
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,490
You don't have to kill us.

713
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,950
Really?

714
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,710
Who would have thought

715
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,180
that I'd become the grue?

716
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,460
You want to wave that gun at me, fine,

717
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,630
but don't you dare threaten my daughter.

718
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,260
Here I thought you were all nails and hair.

719
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,660
Try single mom who's worked 60 hour weeks in six inch heels

720
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,400
for tips in order to raise that genius child

721
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,560
you see right there.

722
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,560
I may not understand all this cyber whatever,

723
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,180
But I know without that gun,

724
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,710
you wouldn't last 10 seconds against my girl.

725
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,370
Too bad she doesn't have 10 seconds.

726
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,980
I disagree!

727
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,070
Put the gun down.

728
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,180
You were always good, Felicity.

729
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,650
So good.

730
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,290
But so am I.

731
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,450
Motion sensored.

732
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,760
They can hit most any target.

733
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:26,930
Come on.

734
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,620
Something's wrong.

735
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,240
Clear.

736
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,930
This is all your fault.

737
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,150
Mom! Mom, are you OK? Are you OK?

738
00:35:59,140 --> 00:35:59,850
Before,

739
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,500
you were right to keep pressing on Cooper.

740
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,460
Turns out he's not as dead as I thought.

741
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,470
I've had some experience with that.

742
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,300
And you learn not to judge.

743
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,580
Yes.

744
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,210
Are you OK?

745
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,060
I guess so.

746
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,290
Old lovers have a way of opening old wounds.

747
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,980
Lovers...

748
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,130
sounds creepy no matter how you say it.

749
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,360
Felicity...

750
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,960
I want you to know that

751
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,930
whatever experiences you had to go through,

752
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,570
I'm glad that you did.

753
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,410
They shaped the person you are today.

754
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,140
And you know how I feel about her.

755
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,730
I should head out.

756
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,330
You were right.

757
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,740
We have to love our families.

758
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,500
No matter what.

759
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,480
Felicity.

760
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,620
You here?

761
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,320
What happened to you?

762
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,930
This is me now.

763
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,240
You were right.

764
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,780
Something is going on with me.

765
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,030
And my father, he-- he noticed it as well.

766
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,140
He told me I should open up to someone.

767
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,320
My sister, she--

768
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,230
She died.

769
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,180
Well, she--

770
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,170
She was murdered.

771
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,800
- Did they ever catch the-- - No.

772
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,270
No one knows that she's gone except for me.

773
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,250
And I can't tell anyone. So, yes.

774
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,770
Yes, I am angry.

775
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,100
I'm going to help you with that.

776
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,670
See, before, Laurel, you were swinging at your sister's killer.

777
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,530
That's a target you're never going to hit.

778
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,030
Don't train for that.

779
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,660
All right, train for yourself.

780
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,720
See, now I know how to teach you.

781
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,460
So what's it going to be?

782
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,100
Red or black?

783
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,500
Black.

784
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,280
Definitely black.

785
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,450
It was popcorn, right?

786
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,950
You said you were meeting me halfway.

787
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,710
This is me doing my part.

788
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,670
I missed you, Speedy.

789
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:01,320
Let's not miss each other anymore.

790
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,790
I mean, it was so much easier to be in each other's lives

791
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,530
when we were underneath the same roof.

792
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,360
So...why don't you move in with me?

793
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,650
I mean, clearly I have enough space.

794
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,200
And I...

795
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,860
I swear once the club starts making a profit,

796
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,920
I will donate all of Malcolm's money

797
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:26,340
to an earthquake relief charity thing.

798
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,770
I can live with that.

799
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,170
You got a TV in here?

800
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,200
Well, I'm officially off.

801
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,670
I mean, my flight doesn't leave till tonight,

802
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,290
but I figured you'd be working, so we can--

803
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,280
We can just say good-bye now.

804
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,250
You were right.

805
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,630
About what?

806
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,890
I haven't always been appreciative of you.

807
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:25,030
You were always there for me every day, and night.

808
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,170
So if I haven't said thank you enough,

809
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,090
thank you.

810
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,240
But you were wrong, too.

811
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
Mm-hmm?

812
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,270
When you said all you saw in me was dad;

813
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,250
There was nothing of you in me.

814
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:42,540
Well, I can't really explain it,

815
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,390
but over the past two years, I have been through a lot.

816
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,940
And I have learned that I am a lot tougher than I thought.

817
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,100
That... I get from you.

818
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,370
Don't cry.

819
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,760
So I took another look at those cogeneration numbers.

820
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,800
You want to...

821
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,850
- Hi again. - Hi.

822
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,680
How's that new smart wearable working out for you?

823
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,290
Oh, it's, um,

824
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,420
it's a real life saver.

825
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:12,930
Yeah.

826
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,550
Ray, I can't come into work today.

827
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,860
I am...

828
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,460
Calling in sick.

829
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,750
"Feel better."

830
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,810
Thank you.

831
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,330
See you later.

832
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,520
That's actually pretty genius.

833
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,530
Hello, Sara.

834
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,100
What are you doing here?

835
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,140
Hello, Sara.

836
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,780
What are you doing here?
