1
00:00:00,633 --> 00:00:02,039
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,207
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:08,472
<i>To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:11,510
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,944
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:17,015
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:20,385
<i>but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,686
<i>and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:26,284
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:29,176
<i>Previously, on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:30,957
Zoom wants you dead.

12
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:35,776
<i>Do you think he can do
everything really fast?</i>

13
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:38,410
- How you doing, Dick?
- You're fast.

14
00:00:39,644 --> 00:00:41,477
Welcome to my Earth-2.

15
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:44,817
Dad!

16
00:00:45,053 --> 00:00:46,587
No! No!

17
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:48,899
Caitlin. That is your name, isn't it?

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,867
I hate the name Caitlin. I'm Killer Frost.

19
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:54,304
Ronnie and Caitlin's
doppelgangers are evil?

20
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,605
If you're coming with us. We have to go.

21
00:00:58,242 --> 00:00:59,342
Cisco!

22
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:00,844
Get ready to close the breach for good,

23
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:01,945
Zoom's coming.

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,771
No!

25
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:15,048
He's not dead. He's not dead.

26
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:16,543
Caitlin...

27
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,310
He's not dead. He's not.

28
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,213
- Caitlin...
- This isn't happening.

29
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,914
This isn't happening again.

30
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,148
Hey, I got you.

31
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:24,951
Come on.

32
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,868
- Open it up.
- Allen...

33
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:32,692
- I need to go back.
- I can't do that.

34
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,326
- Open it up!
- Allen!

35
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,262
The breaches are closed.

36
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,532
All the breaches are closed.

37
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,936
Why can't we just open one of 'em?

38
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,224
The quark matter energy that
we used to seal the breaches,

39
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:51,284
it prevents them from
being opened, ever again.

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,891
There's no going back to our world.

41
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:55,253
Wait.

42
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:57,501
We're trapped here for good?

43
00:01:58,248 --> 00:01:59,348
Yes.

44
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:06,324
No, we can't just let
Zoom get away with this.

45
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:08,125
He just murdered Jay right in front of us.

46
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,794
There's got to be something we can do.

47
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:10,895
There's not.

48
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:15,833
Not this time.

49
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:20,738
It's over.

50
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:24,108
No.

51
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,653

- WEB-DL resync by GoldenBeard -
- www.addic7ed.com -

52
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,362
How's she doing?

53
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:48,266
Not good. We tried to get her to go home,

54
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:50,967
but she refused to leave, so, you know,

55
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,936
I just sat with her until she fell asleep.

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,860
First Ronnie, now Jay.

57
00:02:57,182 --> 00:02:58,349
Yeah.

58
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,125
I'm afraid what this double
dose of grief is gonna do to her.

59
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:04,194
I mean, she's pretty shell-shocked.

60
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:05,428
She'll be fine.

61
00:03:05,963 --> 00:03:08,463
Snow's strong. She'll get past this.

62
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:14,490
But in the meantime, I
would not say anything to her

63
00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:17,015
about her counterpart from my Earth.

64
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,919
That goes for Joe and Iris too.

65
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,020
Why?

66
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:22,489
Because you don't want
to influence their reality

67
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,224
in ways that should not be influenced.

68
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:26,927
Like in the same way as
when Barry time-travels?

69
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:28,361
Exactly, but also,

70
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,129
what's the point?

71
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:33,665
Those people are not your people.

72
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,036
Their lives are not your lives.

73
00:03:36,037 --> 00:03:37,870
Never were, never will be.

74
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:39,705
Bury it. Move on.

75
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,410
Yes?

76
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:46,950
Yeah. That I can do.

77
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:52,485
Allen?

78
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,428
<i>So that's what we did.</i>

79
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:06,431
<i>We didn't talk about Earth-2.</i>

80
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:09,536
<i>We kept what happened there
between the three of us</i>

81
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:11,271
<i>and got on with our lives knowing</i>

82
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:14,572
<i>there was nothing we
could do now to stop Zoom.</i>

83
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,451
<i>Instead, we tried to just adjust</i>

84
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:27,952
<i>to our new circumstances
and cope with our losses.</i>

85
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,791
<i>Jay's death took its toll...</i>

86
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,980
<i>left scars on all of us,
some more than others.</i>

87
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:42,801
<i>And so to try and keep my mind</i>

88
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:44,871
<i>off thoughts of the
surreal other life</i>

89
00:04:44,872 --> 00:04:47,706
<i>I experienced that wasn't my own,</i>

90
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,377
<i>I kept running, waiting for some</i>

91
00:04:50,378 --> 00:04:52,479
<i>other meta-human threat
to rear its ugly head</i>

92
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,047
<i>and distract me from the
frustration I was feeling,</i>

93
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:58,217
<i>and as fate would have it,</i>

94
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:00,253
<i>I did not have to wait long.</i>

95
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:02,222
All good.

96
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,467
Hey, ugly! It's time for dinner.

97
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,873
I think Bruce has gone belly up.

98
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:24,611
Power down the grid.

99
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:31,249
We're gonna have to fish him out.

100
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:44,664
So this is where Waller kept
all her secret projects, huh?

101
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:47,032
One of many sites, I'm learning.

102
00:05:47,234 --> 00:05:49,469
I'm sure the new Director
of A.R.G.U.S. will clean up

103
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,304
the mess that Waller left behind.

104
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:53,340
Easier said than done, honey.

105
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,441
Hey.

106
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:58,078
My wife can do anything
she puts her mind to.

107
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,446
<i>Code seven in Aquaria Three.</i>

108
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,548
<i>I repeat, code seven
in Aquaria Three.</i>

109
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:03,483
There's been breach in the aquarium!

110
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:05,451
You have an aquarium? Why?

111
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:09,823
What the hell?

112
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:28,107
Are you kidding me?

113
00:06:34,515 --> 00:06:37,164
Seven, six, five,

114
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,488
four, three, two, one.

115
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:41,988
- Whoa! Yes!
- Time.

116
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:44,089
Ain't nobody faster than me.

117
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,291
Whoo.

118
00:06:45,559 --> 00:06:48,192
I don't know about that.

119
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,933
Earth to Barry.

120
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,951
It's your turn, dude.

121
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:55,402
Yeah, it's time to show this little punk

122
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:58,037
who the fastest stack attacker alive is.

123
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,071
One of you guys go ahead. I'm gonna pass.

124
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:03,737
You're afraid of a little competition?

125
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:06,856
No, just not in a gaming mood right now.

126
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:12,050
Okay, well, I guess that makes me champ.

127
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:14,254
Right?

128
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:17,023
Anyway, I'm gonna go
meet up with some friends.

129
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:18,124
All right.

130
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:24,105
- Bye.
- Bye.

131
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:27,968
Maybe next time.

132
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,742
And I thought you were the competitive one

133
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:36,843
in the family.

134
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:38,411
I know, right? What's up, Bar?

135
00:07:38,412 --> 00:07:39,712
Nothing. Just...

136
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:44,113
I don't know, I don't think
Wally likes me too much.

137
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:45,822
Well, we can fix that.

138
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:49,190
I mean, you been so busy running
between alternate realities,

139
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:51,829
you two haven't had a chance
to spend any time together.

140
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,990
What you want us to do together?

141
00:07:55,763 --> 00:07:57,259
Get to know each other,

142
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:59,698
find something that
you guys have in common.

143
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,767
He's part of the family now, Bar,

144
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,234
You're gonna have to give it a chance.

145
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:05,338
I know.

146
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,842
All right, well, look, I'm
gonna head to bed, all right?

147
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:09,943
Mm.

148
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:12,044
- Good night.
- Good night.

149
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:17,449
Something is up with him,

150
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:19,385
and I don't think it's just Jay's death.

151
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:20,820
He's been acting weird
ever since he came back

152
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:21,921
from Earth-2.

153
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:25,358
Did he say anything to you
about what happened over there?

154
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,992
No, not a thing. You?

155
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:32,298
Hmm.

156
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:43,282
Hey, so... I been thinking.

157
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:46,112
You've been working around the clock.

158
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:48,181
Maybe you want to get some rest, go home.

159
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:49,415
You know, a good night's sleep wouldn't be

160
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:50,550
the worst thing in the world.

161
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:51,651
I'm fine.

162
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,145
Look, I get it.

163
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:54,546
You're having a hard
time with what happened.

164
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,248
It's a lot to take so soon after...

165
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:57,549
I said I'm fine.

166
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,459
Hey. Did you hear that?

167
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,560
No, what?

168
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:10,228
Caitlin just bit my head off.

169
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:12,564
She's been all business,
no emotion lately.

170
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,114
She's been... cold.

171
00:09:16,202 --> 00:09:17,835
Cold? Come on, Cisco.

172
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:22,178
This could be the beginning
of her becoming evil.

173
00:09:22,203 --> 00:09:23,436
You're not worried about that?

174
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,737
I'm not worried about that.

175
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,006
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

176
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:29,242
Hm. You haven't mentioned anything

177
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,677
about about Earth-2, have you?

178
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:32,879
No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.

179
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,281
All right, well, look, I
mean, it's gonna take some time

180
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,449
for her to heal.

181
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:39,218
We just got to be there
for her, keep her busy.

182
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,587
That shouldn't be a problem.

183
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:42,088
Oh. Hey, Dig, Lyla.

184
00:09:42,856 --> 00:09:44,356
What are you guys doing here?

185
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:46,526
We came to give you the head's up, Barry.

186
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:47,627
About what?

187
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,062
A meta-human who escaped
from A.R.G.U.S. custody,

188
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:51,697
goes by the name King Shark.

189
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:52,799
King Shark?

190
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,668
You mean the half-man/half-shark
that tried to kill you

191
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:57,469
months ago. I thought he was dead.

192
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,938
That's what A.R.G.U.S.
wanted you to believe

193
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:00,773
when they snatched him up, but believe me,

194
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:02,608
this half-shark is very much alive,

195
00:10:02,609 --> 00:10:05,678
and his biological imperative
is telling him to do one thing.

196
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,112
That's kill you, Barry.

197
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,517
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

198
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:22,117
So how do you know about King Shark?

199
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:24,077
Well, as the new Director of A.R.G.U.S.,

200
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:26,813
Lyla's job is to clean
up Amanda Waller's messes.

201
00:10:26,814 --> 00:10:28,882
King Shark was one of the
bigger and weirder ones.

202
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:30,484
And it appears under her directives,

203
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:32,486
A.R.G.U.S. had been
monitoring meta-human activity

204
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:33,720
for the past two years.

205
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:34,147
Why?

206
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:37,230
Well, to see if any of those
powers could be exploited.

207
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,430
Weaponized.

208
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:42,434
How do you know that he's coming after me?

209
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:45,137
While in our custody, he
kept saying the same thing.

210
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:47,171
"Zoom wants The Flash dead"

211
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,075
And although he removed
the tracker we had in him,

212
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,710
the readings we did
receive show he that was

213
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:52,811
headed towards Central City.

214
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:53,912
Let him come.

215
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:56,448
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

216
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,716
We just came here to warn you, man.

217
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:58,817
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

218
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:00,519
Nah, I can't do that, Dig.

219
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,855
I'm sorry, but all year,
we've been sitting ducks

220
00:11:02,856 --> 00:11:05,023
for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.

221
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,524
This is the last one.

222
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:08,660
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.

223
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:11,828
I'm going after him
first. I owe that to Jay.

224
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,833
Wells, he's from your Earth.
What do you know about him?

225
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:16,668
Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a...

226
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:19,972
get this... marine biologist
before my particle accelerator

227
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:23,142
changed him into King Shark, and
Zoom put him under his control.

228
00:11:23,143 --> 00:11:25,511
So how did you track him
when he attacked Barry?

229
00:11:25,512 --> 00:11:27,946
Zoom sent him to this Earth to kill Barry.

230
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:29,114
I just followed.

231
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,550
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.

232
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:33,051
Can you find King Shark too?

233
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:34,152
I can try.

234
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:35,554
All right.

235
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:41,223
Okay, well, all these locations
are next to a body of water.

236
00:11:41,294 --> 00:11:42,995
There must only be a few
hours before he needs to get

237
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:45,397
back into the water to
re-oxygenate his blood.

238
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:47,833
I can take the waterfront.

239
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,134
Can you have your team handle the rest?

240
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:51,635
- I'll get them on it.
- All right.

241
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:54,006
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

242
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:55,707
Maybe he could help us somehow.

243
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,675
Or not. Looks like he died

244
00:11:57,944 --> 00:12:00,212
when the particle accelerator exploded.

245
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:01,980
What about next of kin?

246
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,049
He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.

247
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,285
She's a research
scientist at Nautilus Labs,

248
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:09,186
and she studies... wait for it... sharks.

249
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:12,191
Maybe the two of you can go
and see if she's discovered

250
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,992
anything in her research
that could help us.

251
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,093
Sure.

252
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:16,428
Great.

253
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:20,265
- Hey, Digg.
- Yeah?

254
00:12:20,298 --> 00:12:21,398
How's that helmet treating you?

255
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,068
Could use some improvements.

256
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,769
I'll get to work on it.

257
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,904
Hey, Joe, what's up?

258
00:12:25,905 --> 00:12:27,404
Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,

259
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:28,639
he wants to meet up with you.

260
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:29,741
All right.

261
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:31,474
He's working on his engineering project

262
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:32,248
at our place tonight.

263
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:34,712
He would love some help
from that big brain of yours.

264
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:35,970
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,

265
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:37,404
right now is kind of a crazy time.

266
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:38,940
What? What's going on?

267
00:12:38,941 --> 00:12:40,674
Remember that meta-human shark

268
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:42,843
that Patty was after and attacked me?

269
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,113
He's back? I thought Wells... you know.

270
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:47,348
Yeah, me too, but
apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him

271
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:50,518
and he escaped, and now he's
heading for Central City.

272
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,620
I get it.

273
00:12:51,753 --> 00:12:53,986
I'll tell Wally some other time.

274
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:55,856
Hey, you know what?

275
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:57,758
It's all good, I'll make it work.

276
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,992
Tell him tonight should be fine.

277
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:01,329
Are you sure?

278
00:13:01,397 --> 00:13:03,097
- Yeah. <i>
- Thanks, Bar.</i>

279
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,299
Yeah, bye.

280
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:09,036
Why?

281
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:15,776
It's been two years since your
particle accelerator exploded.

282
00:13:15,777 --> 00:13:17,845
Seems a little late to be asking questions

283
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:19,680
about my husband, doesn't it?

284
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:22,918
Your husband passed away
from cancer, correct?

285
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:25,019
I suppose you could say that.

286
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,154
It only took three days
for every cell in his body

287
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:28,788
to grow uncontrollably.

288
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,550
Whatever cancer he had, it
turned him into something...

289
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:34,228
not human.

290
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,131
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

291
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:37,831
There's a meta-human in Central City

292
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:39,333
whose body seems to be mutating

293
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:41,835
in the same way as your late husband,

294
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:45,039
but he didn't die, he
became a dangerous monster.

295
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,908
My husband was no monster.

296
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,311
That's not what she was implying.

297
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,212
What does this have to do with me?

298
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:53,348
We've read about the research
you're doing here on sharks.

299
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,516
Mm-hmm, yeah, I've had
some encouraging results,

300
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,417
although still preliminary.

301
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,020
We need to see it.

302
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,454
I beg your pardon?

303
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,324
Your research, all of it.

304
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:05,158
What my colleague means to say is that

305
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,861
if you could please let us
take a look at your findings,

306
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:11,896
it could help us stop this
meta-human from hurting anyone.

307
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:16,368
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs.
I'm just supposed to trust you?

308
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:18,540
Please, Mrs. Lamden.

309
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:20,974
This could help save lives.

310
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,711
I'll email you what I have.

311
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,715
Thank you.

312
00:14:31,187 --> 00:14:33,820
- Little harsh.
- I was being direct.

313
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,524
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

314
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:37,926
You've been acting differently toward me

315
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:40,494
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

316
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:42,428
What's your problem, Cisco?

317
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:44,532
Nothing.

318
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:46,533
Let's just go.

319
00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:58,279
Grid one, negative.

320
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,150
Grid four, negative.

321
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:09,991
Status check, grid two.

322
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,426
<i>Grid two, negative.</i>

323
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:12,527
Anything?

324
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:13,962
No, man, nothing yet.

325
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:15,764
Yeah, so far, nothing on our end either.

326
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:18,866
Let's just hope Wells is
doing better than we are.

327
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,700
Hey, how's Felicity doing?

328
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,636
Well, I'm not gonna lie,
Barry, it was pretty rough

329
00:15:22,637 --> 00:15:26,204
there at first, but you
know Felicity, she's tough.

330
00:15:26,442 --> 00:15:29,778
Yeah, she's just not
returning any of my calls.

331
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,212
She has a lot going on right now.

332
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,148
Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call

333
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:35,716
when this is all over.

334
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:38,353
Just want to catch this thing, man,

335
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,688
have everything to do with
Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,

336
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,322
so we can just move on with our lives.

337
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:46,293
Starting to do that
thing Oliver does, Barry,

338
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:49,563
carry the weight of the
world on your shoulders.

339
00:15:49,564 --> 00:15:52,931
Got to stop that, man,
it's gonna slow you down.

340
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,402
Still nothing.

341
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:56,603
Status check, Grid six.

342
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:58,806
<i>Hold on, I think we got something.</i>

343
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:15,164
So much for cleaning up
after Waller's messes.

344
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:16,863
We don't find King Shark soon,

345
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:19,232
someone's gonna be cleaning up after mine.

346
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,866
We'll find him, Lyla.

347
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,171
All right, I searched the whole area.

348
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,272
He's gone.

349
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:26,573
Couldn't have gotten far.

350
00:16:26,574 --> 00:16:28,275
Still, he knows we're here now.

351
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:30,509
We lost the element of surprise.

352
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:33,569
Not if Wells can figure
out a way to track him.

353
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:35,063
In the meantime, we'll keep looking.

354
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:36,574
All right, I'll meet
up with you guys later.

355
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:39,435
I got to go see Joe's son.

356
00:16:39,535 --> 00:16:43,138
Okay, I thought our
relationship was hard to follow.

357
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:44,239
See ya.

358
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:49,544
He's fast, John, get over it.

359
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:50,645
Never.

360
00:16:58,354 --> 00:17:01,454
Joe thought I should have you take a look.

361
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:06,294
So, this is what I got so
far for my project essay

362
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:08,928
to get into CCU's engineering program.

363
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:13,834
Turbine supercars?

364
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,438
Turbines? Like jet engines?

365
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,673
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an
engine like the ones they have

366
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:22,041
in some helicopters, only
it'd run on bio-diesel.

367
00:17:22,492 --> 00:17:24,325
- Cool.
- It's very cool.

368
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:25,947
Yeah, you're gonna want to address

369
00:17:25,948 --> 00:17:27,582
the fuel economy issue here.

370
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,885
It is a jet, so it's gonna
burn through a lot of fuel.

371
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:32,821
Yeah, that's why I want to use bio-diesel.

372
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:35,089
It'll run off of anything
that burns with oxygen.

373
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,825
No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.

374
00:17:36,826 --> 00:17:38,126
Gonna wake the neighbors...

375
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:39,427
For sure.

376
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:41,429
Anything else?

377
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:44,999
Um...

378
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:48,736
Well, I just... want to help, you know.

379
00:17:48,737 --> 00:17:49,771
I'm just trying to make
sure they don't have

380
00:17:49,772 --> 00:17:51,272
any reason to say no.

381
00:17:51,474 --> 00:17:52,641
Okay.

382
00:17:54,243 --> 00:17:56,810
Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean that...

383
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:58,346
it looks really good.

384
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,218
All right, let's start over, okay?

385
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:04,452
Is it...

386
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:08,487
why don't we go through it
all together, work it out?

387
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:10,024
Sounds good.

388
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:11,392
Cool.

389
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:30,076
This is a complete waste of time.

390
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:33,014
We're not gonna find anything
in Doctor Lamden's research

391
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,382
to tell us how to find King Shark.

392
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:37,218
Maybe I should take a look.

393
00:18:37,219 --> 00:18:38,486
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor

394
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,121
with a specialty in bio-chem.

395
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:42,123
I'm just saying maybe you could use

396
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,424
another set of eyes, considering.

397
00:18:45,227 --> 00:18:46,594
Considering what?

398
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:49,030
Considering the way
you've been acting lately.

399
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:50,598
What does that mean?

400
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,832
You are not yourself, Caitlin,

401
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,036
and it's freaking me out, 'cause you have

402
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:58,870
this icy look in your eye
just like you did over there.

403
00:18:58,877 --> 00:18:59,977
Over there?

404
00:19:00,737 --> 00:19:01,978
You mean Earth-2?

405
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,954
No. Uh, no.

406
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:09,003
Um, what I meant to say was...

407
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:11,400
You met my doppelganger, didn't you?

408
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:14,395
What? No.

409
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:15,635
Cisco.

410
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:17,900
Look, I'm not supposed to say anything.

411
00:19:17,904 --> 00:19:18,482
Why not?

412
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,906
Because I'm not supposed to say anything.

413
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:24,735
Francisco Ramon, if you
don't start talking...

414
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,793
Okay, fine, yes, I met your doppelganger.

415
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:30,535
She's a coldhearted ice
queen named Killer Frost,

416
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,236
a meta-human who enjoyed killing a lot.

417
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,170
There, great.

418
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:38,844
Now Harry's gonna kill me and
throw myself across the room.

419
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:42,290
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

420
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,583
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting

421
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,251
just like she did over there.

422
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:49,419
You're being shut off.
You're being detached.

423
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,955
You're being cold.

424
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,557
Because I have to be right now.

425
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,659
I just watched Jay get killed
right in front of my eyes,

426
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:01,299
just when I was starting
to feel normal again,

427
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,667
just when I was beginning to love.

428
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,072
So if I let myself feel,

429
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,280
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

430
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:13,945
it's never gonna stop,

431
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,681
and that's not gonna help me either,

432
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,783
so let's just get back to this research

433
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:21,417
and figure out how to find King Shark.

434
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:22,921
Okay.

435
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,101
Here you are.

436
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:39,471
Yup, just like back home, always working.

437
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:41,640
I'm trying to locate this King Shark.

438
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,541
He's here? On this Earth?

439
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,710
Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom

440
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,144
brought him here to kill The Flash.

441
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,383
Looks like he's stuck
here just like we are.

442
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:54,185
It looks like he is, and
so I need to figure this out

443
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,760
before more people get hurt, Jessie, so...

444
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,591
Probability distribution algorithm?

445
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,226
Partial matching strategies, yes.

446
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:02,073
Based on what?

447
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:05,425
Semantic trajectories...
water, Central City, The Flash.

448
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,043
What about mobility behaviors?

449
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:09,813
Jessie.

450
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:11,782
Look, you wanted me out of that room,

451
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:14,652
but now that I am, you don't want me here.

452
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:17,622
Just let me help, please.

453
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,191
Grab a marker.

454
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:28,198
Yeah.

455
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:32,021
Hardest part was amping the torque

456
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:33,355
without increasing drag.

457
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:34,890
A heavier engine would
only slow things down,

458
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:36,692
but this streamlined
version should optimize

459
00:21:36,693 --> 00:21:39,126
both the torque and the horsepower.

460
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:42,698
Yeah, I'm just worried
it's... won't be enough still.

461
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:43,999
Here, let's do this...

462
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,334
use a one-to-one transfer gearbox

463
00:21:45,335 --> 00:21:47,636
to drop the output shaft of the engine,

464
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:49,739
reverse rotation and send more power

465
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,440
to the torque converter.

466
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,679
I didn't come for you
to just do it for me.

467
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,581
I thought we were gonna
work on this together.

468
00:21:58,582 --> 00:21:59,982
Yeah, we are, I'm...

469
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:01,884
I'm just trying to speed up the process.

470
00:22:01,885 --> 00:22:02,985
Why?

471
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:07,555
What, you got somewhere better to be?

472
00:22:09,392 --> 00:22:11,490
No, Wally, I'm... Wally.

473
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:14,763
All right.

474
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:17,665
Do you have a problem with me?

475
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:20,669
Who could have a problem with you?

476
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,170
You're Barry, right? You're perfect.

477
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,340
Never do anything wrong.

478
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:27,809
Always this, always that.

479
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:30,679
Wally.

480
00:22:30,814 --> 00:22:32,348
I mean, take a look around you, man.

481
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:34,916
You're in every picture in this room.

482
00:22:35,218 --> 00:22:37,319
You know, thanks for your help,

483
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,020
but I'll just take care of this myself.

484
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:50,198
Where's The Flash?

485
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,009
I know The Flash is here.

486
00:23:05,647 --> 00:23:07,494
I can smell him.

487
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:09,020
Everybody get out!

488
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,789
Come on. All right, come on.

489
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,627
Where is he?

490
00:23:19,329 --> 00:23:21,370
Right here!

491
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:30,677
Flash, Zoom wants you dead!

492
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:33,107
Yeah, I know.

493
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,312
Then you get to go home, right?

494
00:23:35,684 --> 00:23:37,250
Well, guess what, man.

495
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:40,449
The breaches that Zoom
used to bring you here,

496
00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:44,317
they're all gone. I closed 'em, for good!

497
00:23:45,479 --> 00:23:46,979
There's no more Zoom.

498
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:50,048
There's no way back to your Earth.

499
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:54,754
You're gonna be locked up
here for a very long time.

500
00:23:59,726 --> 00:24:00,826
No!

501
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,919
You might be fast, but not
as fast as I am in water!

502
00:24:18,011 --> 00:24:20,853
You're not gonna catch me, Flash!

503
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,590
Okay.

504
00:24:31,725 --> 00:24:32,825
You okay?

505
00:24:32,926 --> 00:24:34,426
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

506
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:38,363
Think he broke a few things, but I'm good.

507
00:24:49,776 --> 00:24:52,743
I don't suppose my homeowner's insurance

508
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:54,813
covers a "Sharknado" attack.

509
00:24:55,564 --> 00:24:57,398
I don't understand you people.

510
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,965
Jaws busts through your
house like the Kool-Aid Man,

511
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,025
The Flash shows up, and y'all
just act like it's no big deal.

512
00:25:03,112 --> 00:25:05,714
Yeah, well, we've had a
lot of weird things happen

513
00:25:05,926 --> 00:25:07,772
in Central City over the past two years.

514
00:25:07,872 --> 00:25:10,639
Weirder than a talking
shark wearing pants?

515
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,473
Man, you'd be surprised.

516
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,643
Hey.

517
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:17,579
Hey, you guys. Everybody okay?

518
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:19,481
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.

519
00:25:19,482 --> 00:25:21,650
What'd you go hide under your bed?

520
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:22,884
Wally, come on.

521
00:25:23,052 --> 00:25:25,654
You know, Joe and Iris
told me a lot about you,

522
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:27,823
made it out like you could
walk on water, or something,

523
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:29,458
but they never mentioned anything

524
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,093
about you being a coward.

525
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:32,194
Okay, enough!

526
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,334
See you guys later.

527
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:47,341
Dad, you need to talk to him.

528
00:25:47,477 --> 00:25:49,943
No. It's fine, I get it.

529
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:53,664
Look, I know you guys love me,

530
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:56,433
but please stop telling Wally
all this great stuff about me.

531
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:58,601
Start telling him the
truth. I'm not perfect.

532
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,452
I make mistakes that
even The Flash can't fix.

533
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,577
Okay.

534
00:26:03,675 --> 00:26:06,042
What happened with you on Earth-2?

535
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:07,611
The truth.

536
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:13,204
I shouldn't... tell you guys this, but...

537
00:26:14,431 --> 00:26:16,198
I met your doppelgangers.

538
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:20,505
You were the cop in the
family, a good one too.

539
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,301
I told you I would've made a good cop.

540
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:24,893
Don't get any ideas.

541
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:27,167
What about me then?

542
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,068
You were a lounge singer.

543
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:32,837
Yeah, you had this
amazing voice, actually,

544
00:26:32,908 --> 00:26:35,008
but you didn't like me at all.

545
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:38,112
You actually blamed me
for Iris becoming a cop,

546
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:40,146
said that she only became one

547
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:43,450
to help her selfish husband's career.

548
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,686
Wait.

549
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:47,922
We were married?

550
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,290
Mm-hmm.

551
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:53,459
And we went to go see Joe perform.

552
00:26:56,064 --> 00:26:58,697
And that's when everything went wrong.

553
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:04,629
Um, some metas that
worked for Zoom showed up,

554
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,576
they were looking for me.

555
00:27:05,577 --> 00:27:07,844
They knew I wasn't supposed to be there,

556
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,956
and they attacked,

557
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:14,184
and you got caught in the crossfire,

558
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:16,889
and... you died.

559
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:24,931
I knew that it wasn't you,
that none of that was this life,

560
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:25,956
but...

561
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:32,202
I mean, watching it happen
in front of me, living that,

562
00:27:32,203 --> 00:27:37,023
it didn't feel any different,
because it was all still real.

563
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,411
And Jay warned me not to
get emotionally sucked in

564
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:42,712
when I went there,

565
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,881
and then that's exactly what happened.

566
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:52,353
And now Joe West on Earth-2
is dead, because I showed up.

567
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,039
Barry, that... that's not your fault.

568
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:02,097
Yeah, it is my fault.

569
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:04,234
It's all my fault.

570
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:05,902
Zoom,

571
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:08,497
this King Shark,

572
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:11,294
Jay's death,

573
00:28:12,343 --> 00:28:13,976
it's all because of me.

574
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:18,706
And then I just left an entire world

575
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:19,950
at Zoom's mercy.

576
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:39,492
Just when you thought it was
safe to go back in the suburbs,

577
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,624
King Shark shows up at your house.

578
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:43,358
I mean, I don't even know how he found me.

579
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:45,259
It's not like I was The
Flash while I was at home.

580
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,227
- Must be a reason.
- Yeah.

581
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:49,497
Have you figured out a way
to track King Shark yet?

582
00:28:49,498 --> 00:28:51,032
No, I don't have enough information

583
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:53,101
to create an accurate location algorithm.

584
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:54,268
What about Dr. Lamden's research?

585
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:55,536
Anything that can help us?

586
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,443
I didn't think so at first,

587
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,677
but then I found something
that I think might help us.

588
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,687
Sharks are predators.

589
00:29:00,712 --> 00:29:02,246
In order to track their prey, they use

590
00:29:02,247 --> 00:29:04,281
what's known as passive electrolocation.

591
00:29:04,282 --> 00:29:05,983
Passive electrolocation?

592
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:07,985
Yes, it's how they sense
the bioelectric potential

593
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:09,486
around a fish's body.

594
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:11,989
King Shark senses
electricity in Barry's system.

595
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,792
Okay, that explains how
King Shark can track Barry,

596
00:29:14,793 --> 00:29:16,527
but how is that going
to help us track him?

597
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:17,995
We flip it. Instead of King Shark

598
00:29:17,996 --> 00:29:19,697
being the predator, we make him the prey,

599
00:29:19,698 --> 00:29:22,299
and track him using
active electrolocation.

600
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,435
We reprogram our satellite to generate

601
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:26,337
a specific electric field and then measure

602
00:29:26,338 --> 00:29:28,005
any electrical distortions that correlate

603
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:29,906
with a 1-ton walking shark.

604
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:32,475
That'll help us get him.

605
00:29:32,844 --> 00:29:34,011
You help me out?

606
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:35,813
Sure.

607
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,109
Great.

608
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:41,312
Let us know when you locate him
and we'll take it from there.

609
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:42,487
Okay.

610
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:44,611
Let's get the team ready.

611
00:29:56,925 --> 00:29:59,025
What exactly is that?

612
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:02,195
That, my friend, is bait.

613
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:03,965
You made a Flash lure?

614
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:05,533
It's the best I could come up with

615
00:30:05,534 --> 00:30:06,901
given the time frame.

616
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:08,436
It's rigged to mimic and enhance

617
00:30:08,437 --> 00:30:10,138
the electric field Barry's body generates.

618
00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:11,572
King Shark takes one whiff of that,

619
00:30:11,573 --> 00:30:12,807
<i>cue the "Jaws" soundtrack.</i>

620
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:14,342
Also stuffed it with enough tranqs

621
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:15,643
to knock him out for a month.

622
00:30:15,644 --> 00:30:17,845
Should make him a lot easier to reel in.

623
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:19,346
And that container.

624
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:21,582
Strong enough to hold
him once he's sedated?

625
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:24,252
It's made of promethium
metal. It's impenetrable.

626
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:25,953
Meanwhile, we'll be able
to keep track of King Shark

627
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,723
with this, and the cameras
that are on the lure.

628
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:30,758
Whatever he does, we'll have eyes on him.

629
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,259
All right, then. Let's go fishing.

630
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:36,697
Caitlin, I don't understand why

631
00:30:36,698 --> 00:30:39,267
I can't be the one playing
Quint in this scenario.

632
00:30:39,268 --> 00:30:41,968
I should be the one out there, not you.

633
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,403
I need to do this.

634
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:45,839
You know Quint dies, right?

635
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:53,848
Water is this monster's natural habitat.

636
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:55,416
He's gonna be a lot stronger here.

637
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:56,850
You sure about this?

638
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:58,919
This ends tonight.

639
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:07,462
Maybe he's not gonna fall for this

640
00:31:07,463 --> 00:31:09,363
He's a shark. He'll come.

641
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,166
Anything, Cisco?

642
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:16,771
Uh, nope, nothing that
looks like it could be him.

643
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:18,539
You programmed the
satellite though, right?

644
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,129
Yes, Harry.

645
00:31:19,229 --> 00:31:20,463
I mean, you punched in
the correct parameters?

646
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:21,831
You're insulting my intelligence.

647
00:31:21,832 --> 00:31:23,199
But they've been waiting for hours.

648
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,567
Did you punch in the correct parameters?

649
00:31:24,568 --> 00:31:26,169
I know they've been out there for hours,

650
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,370
but you're insulting my
intelligence with this, okay?

651
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:28,671
- I know.
- Okay.

652
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:30,006
Hey, you set the right
distortion scope, right?

653
00:31:30,007 --> 00:31:32,091
Oh, for real? Okay.

654
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,758
You know what, we're
gonna play a game here.

655
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,093
It's called, if you're from Earth-2,

656
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:37,061
you're gonna be quiet, okay?

657
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:38,430
Yeah.

658
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,339
Hey, Barry, are you okay?

659
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:52,010
Ever since Zoom beat
me here and on Earth-2,

660
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:54,444
I've been running away from things,

661
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:56,514
instead of towards them.

662
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,583
That needs to change.

663
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,919
We'll get you back there.

664
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:02,755
I know.

665
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,223
Think of this as your first step.

666
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,324
Or swim.

667
00:32:11,365 --> 00:32:14,902
Uh, hey, guys. What is that?

668
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:21,016
The big kahuna. Guys, incoming.

669
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,208
<i>He's headed for the bait!</i>

670
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,391
Whoa.

671
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,359
He ate the lure!

672
00:32:40,594 --> 00:32:42,361
Reel him in, all right?

673
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:44,896
Come on.

674
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:57,076
Where'd he go?

675
00:32:57,611 --> 00:32:59,578
He's headed for the docks.

676
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:01,847
Go, go, go.

677
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,515
Get ready to fire!

678
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:22,009
Those guns won't stop me, Flash.

679
00:33:22,182 --> 00:33:25,240
First I'll kill you, then I'll kill them.

680
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:28,173
Oh, yeah? Let's do this then!

681
00:33:28,574 --> 00:33:29,674
Come on!

682
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,770
What is he doing?

683
00:33:57,771 --> 00:33:59,704
He's electrifying the water.

684
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:44,984
Ohh.

685
00:34:46,986 --> 00:34:49,286
Now we can reel him in.

686
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,156
Hell of a catch, Barry.

687
00:35:05,157 --> 00:35:06,257
Yeah.

688
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,593
Let's just make sure he doesn't
become "the one that got away."

689
00:35:09,594 --> 00:35:11,062
Won't let that happen again.

690
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:12,763
What are you gonna do with him?

691
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:15,299
I don't know yet. But
one thing's for sure,

692
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,835
A.R.G.U.S.'s plans to turn
King Shark into a weapon

693
00:35:17,836 --> 00:35:19,536
died with Amanda Waller.

694
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:21,997
I think our time would be better served

695
00:35:21,998 --> 00:35:25,167
learning about how he came
to be and how to cure him.

696
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:27,569
You know, you should
really talk to Dr. Lamden.

697
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,204
She's done a lot of research,

698
00:35:29,205 --> 00:35:31,039
and I think it could be helpful to you.

699
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,673
I'll do that. Nice to see you again.

700
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:35,244
Mm-hmm.

701
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:40,831
Well, thanks a lot, Dig.

702
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,985
Hey, I got to thank you, Barry.

703
00:35:42,986 --> 00:35:47,153
Got Lyla get her first win, I
got to watch you run on water.

704
00:35:47,757 --> 00:35:48,924
It was biblical.

705
00:35:53,563 --> 00:35:54,963
Look, Barry, when I was in Afghanistan,

706
00:35:54,964 --> 00:35:57,464
I lost a lot of friends... brothers.

707
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:01,668
So losing Jay, I know what it feels like.

708
00:36:02,005 --> 00:36:05,372
Question yourself. Blame
yourself for his death.

709
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,126
And that guilt, it can tear
you apart, but trust me, man,

710
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:13,314
you got to get control of it,

711
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,983
or it'll rip you up inside.

712
00:36:17,654 --> 00:36:19,887
Use this, man, let it guide you,

713
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:22,156
so it never happens again.

714
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:24,293
- All right, thanks, man.
- You got it.

715
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:25,794
Say hi to everyone for me, all right?

716
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:27,295
I will.

717
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:37,705
Yeah, okay. That's kind of freaky.

718
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:39,875
Yeah, yeah, see? I told you.

719
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:41,509
Hey, Oliver, what's up?

720
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,250
You're a really slow reader.

721
00:36:53,423 --> 00:36:54,523
So?

722
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:57,626
I want one of these super cars.

723
00:36:57,627 --> 00:36:58,994
I mean, especially if I can run it

724
00:36:58,995 --> 00:37:01,563
off the bacon grease I collect? I mean...

725
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:03,597
Man, Wally. I'm so impressed.

726
00:37:05,368 --> 00:37:06,468
Thanks.

727
00:37:06,736 --> 00:37:09,369
But Barry gave me a lot of help, so...

728
00:37:09,557 --> 00:37:12,326
Yeah, he did, but this was all your idea,

729
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:14,443
this is your hard work. It's all you.

730
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:16,344
Barry'd say the same thing.

731
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,180
Would he?

732
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:22,351
Look, Wally.

733
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:29,275
Iris and I took Barry in when he was 11,

734
00:37:29,692 --> 00:37:31,026
and the reason he came to live with us

735
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:34,032
is because his mother was murdered,

736
00:37:34,197 --> 00:37:37,564
and his father was
wrongfully imprisoned for it.

737
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:42,871
And I have been overprotective
of that kid since that day.

738
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:47,764
We gave him all the love
and support he needed

739
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,665
to get through that tragedy

740
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,501
and become the man he is now.

741
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:55,795
So that... that pride

742
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,309
you see when Iris and
I are talking about him,

743
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,410
is because...

744
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,527
things could have gone very differently.

745
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,593
But he's not perfect,

746
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:11,952
and he's not favored over
you or Iris or anybody else.

747
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,657
So you have nothing to worry about.

748
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,161
He's my son...

749
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,297
just like you are.

750
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:27,504
What are you doing with those?

751
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:29,139
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger,

752
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,174
see if I can get these to work over here.

753
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,276
So you can catch some breachers?

754
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,844
Dear God!

755
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,145
Caitlin, your hands are freezing.

756
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,848
Caitlin. I've always hated that name.

757
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,252
Oh, no.

758
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,022
No, no, no, it's starting.
You're starting to become...

759
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:47,123
Killer Frost?

760
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,696
That ain't right.

761
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:55,165
That ain't right, that's just rude.

762
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,432
Who put you up to this?

763
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:57,667
Barry put you up to this, didn't he?

764
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,103
Oh, I should've know you two were...

765
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,271
- Cold?
- Yeah.

766
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,339
You deserve it for thinking

767
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,707
that I could ever become like her.

768
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,045
Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.

769
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:12,048
I may be sad, I may want to
be alone for a little while,

770
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,416
but I promise you, Killer
Frost will never exist

771
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,119
on this earth, okay?

772
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,521
Besides, you tested me.

773
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,155
I don't even have the meta-human gene,

774
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,858
so please stop worrying about me, okay?

775
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:26,462
Okay.

776
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:30,164
Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.

777
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,770
For real, though, you got
to work on that circulation.

778
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,505
You might have Raynaud's or something.

779
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:39,139
- You know what Raynaud's is?
- I'm a doctor, Cisco.

780
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,149
Hail, hail, the gang's
all here. What's good?

781
00:39:43,228 --> 00:39:44,328
Uh...

782
00:39:47,414 --> 00:39:50,025
I need to apologize to you all.

783
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:52,518
Um...

784
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,926
Last year I made a choice

785
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:59,695
to go back in time and save my mother,

786
00:40:01,672 --> 00:40:05,512
and that choice had a lot of consequences

787
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,591
that will haunt me for
the rest of my life,

788
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:11,564
just like I know it haunts all of you too.

789
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:18,612
Zoom, Jay's death...

790
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:22,787
It's all because of me,

791
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:26,641
but I own those choices.

792
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,428
We're the ones who opened
the door to Earth-2.

793
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,697
We're the ones who brought Zoom here,

794
00:40:31,698 --> 00:40:35,065
but we are also the ones
who are gonna stop him.

795
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:36,769
How?

796
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:40,938
How are we gonna stop Zoom, Allen?

797
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:43,442
I don't know yet.

798
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,049
But those breaches aren't closed forever,

799
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,283
and we're not done with Earth-2.

800
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:02,460
Jay's death was not in vain.

801
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:06,719
We will meet Zoom again,

802
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:10,514
and the next time, I will beat him,

803
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:14,038
whoever that monster is.

804
00:41:47,607 --> 00:41:52,676
Well, this is a complication.
