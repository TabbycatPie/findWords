1
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:12,125
<i>Big crash there!</i>
<i>Sergio Perez in the Force India.</i>

2
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:16,765
<i>The Force India Formula One</i>
<i>team has gone into administration,</i>

3
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:18,725
<i>following a court hearing in London.</i>

4
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:25,085
Administration is there to provide
the opportunity to rescue and save.

5
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:26,805
So no one's giving up.

6
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,525
The team needs real funding
to make sure it delivers

7
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,445
the potential that Otmar
says you can all deliver.

8
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:35,245
As long as we stay together,

9
00:00:36,365 --> 00:00:40,165
we will find
the best possible financial solution

10
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:41,885
and ownership going forward.

11
00:00:46,245 --> 00:00:47,645
<i>The future for Force India</i>

12
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:50,405
<i>has been dominating</i>
<i>the headlines over the summer,</i>

13
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:55,645
<i>The team has survived after</i>
<i>the administrators reached an agreement</i>

14
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:59,045
<i>with a consortium</i>
<i>of investors on a rescue package.</i>

15
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:01,965
<i>The consortium is led</i>

16
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:03,965
<i>by billionaire businessman,</i>
<i>Lawrence Stroll...</i>

17
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:06,045
- You looking for me?
- Just the man.

18
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,565
<i>...father of 19-year-old Lance Stroll,</i>

19
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:13,445
<i>So, could Lance soon be driving</i>
<i>for his dad's new team?</i>

20
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:17,805
For the moment, I'm here at Williams.

21
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:21,685
I'm not, uh, sure
what I'll be doing in the future.

22
00:01:21,765 --> 00:01:24,525
Uh, we'll see what my father
decides to do with me.

23
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:27,605
He's a nice guy. I hope they'll take me.

24
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:31,005
<i> Lawrence Stroll buying the team</i>

25
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:33,205
<i>is always gonna want his son</i>
<i>to drive for it.</i>

26
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,885
It's basically an open secret
that Lance will move across

27
00:01:36,965 --> 00:01:37,885
and race at Force India.

28
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:43,445
<i>Both drivers at the team,</i>
<i>Sergio Perez and Esteban Ocon,</i>

29
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:44,845
will be looking over their shoulder
wondering,

30
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:47,525
<i>"Well, which one of us</i>
<i>is gonna get the chop?"</i>

31
00:01:48,365 --> 00:01:50,845
And historically,
those two have not got on.

32
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:54,045
- <i> Once again, they have touched.</i>
<i>- Crazy.</i>

33
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:57,005
<i>Guys, what the fuck</i>
<i>is this guy doing?</i>

34
00:01:57,405 --> 00:01:58,445
<i>Fucking idiot.</i>

35
00:02:15,325 --> 00:02:18,285
<i>Welcome to Spa</i>
<i>for the Belgian Grand Prix.</i>

36
00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:23,885
<i>It's an important race for the teams,</i>
<i>and none more so than Force India.</i>

37
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:27,525
<i>The pressure's on</i>
<i>to impress new boss Lawrence Stroll.</i>

38
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,325
How long we gonna wait?

39
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:36,725
My name is Otmar Szafnauer,

40
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:39,685
and I'm the Chief Executive Officer
and Team Principal

41
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:42,445
of Racing Point Force India
Formula One team.

42
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,165
<i>It would've been</i>
<i>a disaster disappearing mid-season.</i>

43
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:50,325
<i>So it was tricky times,</i>
<i>but we came out of it.</i>

44
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,245
The team is pretty much unchanged:

45
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:58,045
<i>same people, same car,</i>
<i>same desire to do well.</i>

46
00:02:58,765 --> 00:03:01,805
<i>But Lance coming into the team</i>
<i>is probably what will happen,</i>

47
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:04,765
<i>and what it means now</i>
<i>is losing one of our drivers.</i>

48
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,365
I know you know.

49
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:12,525
<i>We are facing this unsure future.</i>

50
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:15,405
<i>It's a difficult situation for me.</i>

51
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:19,965
<i>As a kid, I always wanted</i>
<i>to be a racing driver.</i>

52
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:21,805
<i>There was nothing else.</i>

53
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:25,205
<i>I've been racing since</i>
<i>I'm seven years old.</i>

54
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,445
How expensive is it to try
and get kids into F1?

55
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,685
Oof.

56
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:36,285
Uh, it's difficult to tell you how
expensive it is exactly, but, um...

57
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:42,205
for sure, for someone normal,
like we were, it's--

58
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:44,965
Yeah, everyone was saying
it's impossible, basically.

59
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:54,445
<i>My parents, they don't have a lot of money.</i>

60
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:57,045
<i>They sacrificed a lot.</i>

61
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:01,005
<i>We were living in a caravan</i>
<i>for a few years, so we could go to races.</i>

62
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:04,685
It's still here?

63
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:09,205
<i>Without my parents,</i>
<i>I would not be here for sure.</i>

64
00:04:09,285 --> 00:04:10,605
- She isn't coming?
- No.

65
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:18,605
<i>Esteban's story is amazing.</i>

66
00:04:19,405 --> 00:04:21,045
<i>He's come from nothing</i>

67
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,205
<i>to having the potential</i>
<i>to be not just a race winner,</i>

68
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:26,805
<i>but a championship contender.</i>

69
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:31,045
<i>But motor racing's a funny business.</i>

70
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:33,725
<i>Talent will get you so far,</i>

71
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:36,365
but money has a massive role to play.

72
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:44,245
As a driver, if you come with a bevy
of sponsors who can add millions

73
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:48,325
<i>to the pot that the team has</i>
<i>to design, to develop their car,</i>

74
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:50,925
<i>and have increased potential</i>
<i>to score points,</i>

75
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,285
then the team
is gonna look favorably on you,

76
00:04:53,365 --> 00:04:55,205
to take you onboard
as one of their drivers.

77
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,525
<i>Hi, I'm Sergio Perez.</i>
<i>I drive for Force India.</i>

78
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:04,245
I've been here eight years
in Formula One.

79
00:05:04,725 --> 00:05:06,085
I'm 28 years old.

80
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:13,405
<i>F1 was always my dream, to race</i>
<i>with the best drivers in the world.</i>

81
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:19,485
<i>I was always racing in Mexico</i>
<i>and I never thought that an opportunity</i>

82
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:21,605
<i>to race in Europe was going to come up.</i>

83
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,125
<i>It was always very expensive.</i>

84
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:25,485
<i>So we had to find sponsors.</i>

85
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:29,085
<i>Carlos Slim is one of</i>
<i>the richest guys in the world.</i>

86
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:33,125
<i>I remember calling him all the time</i>

87
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:35,605
<i>when I was a fourteen year old</i>
<i>to give me an opportunity.</i>

88
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,845
<i>We started together the dream</i>
<i>of making it into Formula One.</i>

89
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:48,125
<i>The career that I have, it's pretty much</i>
<i>linked to our decisions we took together.</i>

90
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:52,125
<i>Sergio's always had</i>
<i>a very strong hand at Force India</i>

91
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:53,765
because he was the money guy.

92
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,005
He brought big sponsorships
from Mexico with him,

93
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,605
but now, there's a bigger fish,
and that bigger fish is Lawrence Stroll.

94
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,845
<i>So Sergio's not king of the hill anymore.</i>

95
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,845
It's anyone's guess,
at the moment, who gets that seat.

96
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:08,685
<i>Esteban and Sergio...</i>

97
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:11,725
I don't think they're
on each other's Christmas card list.

98
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,165
I think it's fair to say that.

99
00:06:18,485 --> 00:06:21,045
<i>Formula One is massively competitive,</i>

100
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:24,965
<i>but the situation</i>
<i>with Ocon and Perez in 2017</i>

101
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:28,805
<i>went beyond the point that I think</i>
<i>any of us thought that it would.</i>

102
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:35,805
You've gotta understand the psychology
and the dynamics of the team,

103
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:37,205
and how that worked.

104
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:41,645
<i>You know, Esteban had to quickly</i>
<i>make a name for himself.</i>

105
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:42,885
<i>He was a rookie.</i>

106
00:06:43,685 --> 00:06:47,365
<i>Sergio, he had to assert himself</i>
<i>as the driver</i>

107
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:49,405
<i>that was with the team the longest.</i>

108
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:54,565
<i>This is two teammates</i>
<i>scrapping away here.</i>

109
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:57,765
<i>Ocon is gonna go for it again,</i>
<i>trying to get past Perez,</i>

110
00:06:57,845 --> 00:06:59,645
<i>but here comes Vettel in the Ferrari.</i>

111
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:03,645
<i>Up the inside into turn one,</i>
<i>Ocon slithers out wide.</i>

112
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:06,605
<i>And the two Force Indias,</i>
<i>after fighting each other,</i>

113
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:07,925
<i>have lost a place.</i>

114
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:11,085
<i>He moved at the last moment.</i>
<i>What is this?</i>

115
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,365
<i>It's not fair racing at all.</i>

116
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:17,445
<i>Esteban, did your teammate</i>
<i>cost you a chance</i>

117
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:19,165
<i>at your first Formula One podium today?</i>

118
00:07:19,765 --> 00:07:22,365
Uh, yeah. I think so, for sure.

119
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:23,685
But, that's racing, you know?

120
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,605
Um... and that's not gonna
 take away my smile.

121
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,005
<i> Are you racing</i>
<i>for Sergio Perez,</i>

122
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:30,645
<i>or are you racing for Force India?</i>

123
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:32,965
<i>Oh, of course, I'm racing</i>
<i>for my team, you know?</i>

124
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:37,765
I think I just defend the position
as I will do to anyone.

125
00:07:39,285 --> 00:07:41,405
<i>The two Force Indias</i>
<i>vying for position.</i>

126
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:45,005
<i>Perez gets ahead of Ocon.</i>

127
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:47,605
<i>They come into the left-hander...</i>
<i>oh, they've made contact!</i>

128
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:49,565
<i> Big damage</i>
<i>to Perez's front wing.</i>

129
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:50,845
<i> Both damaged.</i>

130
00:07:51,325 --> 00:07:53,245
<i>What did Esteban do, guys?</i>

131
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:58,365
I think he was just over-aggressive.

132
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,805
I think, um, what happened today
is totally unacceptable for the team.

133
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,405
He says
that you gave him no room.

134
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:06,565
Says that you squeezed him against a wall,
cost the team a potential win today.

135
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:07,645
That's what he said? Okay.

136
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:10,245
Well, if that's what he said, you know,
I'm not gonna comment.

137
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:16,765
<i>Both Sergio and Esteban,</i>
<i>they're both looking at their future.</i>

138
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:21,605
So this inter-team rivalry
of being top dog at the team

139
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:23,765
becomes all encompassing...

140
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:30,085
<i>The two teammates</i>
<i>are battling again.</i>

141
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:32,765
<i>Perez gets past Ocon,</i>
<i>as they now accelerate</i>

142
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,845
<i>towards the fastest part of the circuit.</i>

143
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,765
<i>Oh! The two Force India's made contact!</i>

144
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,885
<i>Missing a part of his front wing,</i>
<i>Ocon there.</i>

145
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:47,805
<i>- Once again, they have touched.</i>
<i>- Crazy.</i>

146
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:50,445
<i>Guys, what the fuck?</i>

147
00:08:51,045 --> 00:08:52,685
<i>What the fuck is this guy doing?</i>

148
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:54,805
<i>Front wing broken now.</i>

149
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,325
<i> The two Force Indias</i>
<i>get too close together</i>

150
00:08:57,405 --> 00:09:00,285
<i>and it is a puncture for Sergio Perez.</i>

151
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:06,005
<i>Has the relationship</i>
<i>between you totally gone now?</i>

152
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:11,765
I don't know. The thing for sure is
that I'm gonna go speak to him man-to-man

153
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,165
and tell him the truth, you know?

154
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,325
He's gonna have a child. I don't know
if he wants to die or something.

155
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:23,845
It seems that you both get
locked into some huge battles on track.

156
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:26,165
-Is that good for the team?
-Yeah. No, not at all.

157
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:27,725
Especially after today.

158
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:31,525
But we have to look back,
remember Baku, you know?

159
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,005
He put me there on the wall.

160
00:09:34,085 --> 00:09:35,925
I'm not saying that I did it
because of that, you know,

161
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:39,445
but tension starts back then, you know?

162
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,045
<i>It got so bad,</i>

163
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:45,045
<i>the team stepped in</i>
<i>and stopped them from racing each other.</i>

164
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,325
It was as simple as that.

165
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:49,245
They were not allowed
to race one another again.

166
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:54,845
<i>Once they started understanding how</i>
<i>important it was for them to work together</i>

167
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:57,725
and not crash into each other,
it got better.

168
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,605
<i>It's time for qualifying</i>
<i>here in Spa.</i>

169
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,365
<i>Esteban Ocon and Sergio Perez</i>

170
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:16,645
<i>are used to fighting each other</i>
<i>for points,</i>

171
00:10:16,725 --> 00:10:19,205
<i>but now, they're fighting for a seat.</i>

172
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:22,205
<i>Who can show what they're capable of</i>

173
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:25,885
<i>at one of the most challenging</i>
<i>and treacherous tracks in the world?</i>

174
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:33,405
<i>Rain in the air. It would be, it's Spa.</i>

175
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:42,165
<i>The worst of the rain,</i>
<i>we think has missed turn one.</i>

176
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,365
<i>It's raining heavy</i> <i>in the pit lane now.</i>

177
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:52,285
The difference between driving on the wet
and the dry, every lap,

178
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:54,205
one line can be much quicker
than the other one.

179
00:10:55,685 --> 00:10:58,045
<i>So you have to adapt.</i>
<i>Every lap is different conditions.</i>

180
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,525
This is what's fun about it.

181
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:08,965
<i> Lewis Hamilton going for a record</i>
<i>fifth pole position here at Spa.</i>

182
00:11:10,485 --> 00:11:11,805
<i> It's raining a lot</i>
<i>down the back here.</i>

183
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:18,525
<i>The crowd are reaching</i>
<i>for the umbrellas already</i>

184
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:21,405
<i>and it might be that the track</i>
<i>is a bit too slippy.</i>

185
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:24,005
<i>At the speeds</i>
<i>these guys are doing,</i>

186
00:11:24,085 --> 00:11:28,645
when it starts to rain,
your reactions have to be lightning.

187
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,685
<i>Oh, shit. Valtteri's gone off.</i>

188
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:39,645
<i>Valtteri Bottas has slid his way</i>
<i>off the track.</i>

189
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:46,245
<i>Fucking shit, man! Fucking shit!</i>

190
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:51,285
<i>They've got to get</i>
<i>on the right line.</i>

191
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:54,565
<i>They've got to spot every braking point.</i>

192
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:59,805
<i>And it's Hamilton</i>
<i>with the fastest lap-time so far.</i>

193
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,125
<i>That was one tough lap to do.</i>

194
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:10,165
<i> Sergio Perez</i>
<i>looks set to take fourth,</i>

195
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:13,965
<i>an amazing result for Force India,</i>
<i>if he can hang onto it.</i>

196
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:17,605
- <i>Checo, P-4. P-4.</i>
<i>- Good job, guys.</i>

197
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:23,805
<i>There are challenges still to come</i>
<i>for Esteban Ocon.</i>

198
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:32,645
When I was a kid, there was a lot
of time spent on the rain.

199
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:39,245
<i>And when all the kids were stopping</i>
<i>because it was too wet,</i>

200
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,645
<i>they were getting wet,</i>

201
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:45,565
I was keeping going even when I had
freezing hands where I couldn't move.

202
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:46,765
I was crying after that.

203
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,685
But while driving,
I was not feeling anything.

204
00:12:48,765 --> 00:12:51,005
<i>I was pushing to be the best I could.</i>

205
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:04,325
<i>So, Esteban, that is...</i>

206
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:08,165
<i>P-3. P-3.</i>

207
00:13:08,885 --> 00:13:10,565
<i>You're joking. You're joking.</i>

208
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:16,965
<i>Ocon goes third fastest.</i>
<i>His best ever qualifying in Formula One.</i>

209
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:18,685
<i>Whoo! </i>

210
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:20,245
<i>Yes!</i>

211
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:21,325
<i>Whoo! </i>

212
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:25,885
<i>The rain came down</i>
<i>to give Force India</i>

213
00:13:25,965 --> 00:13:28,325
<i>one of their greatest ever days.</i>

214
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,405
<i>They're waiting for you</i>
<i> on the grid.</i>

215
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:34,765
<i>You need to line up in P-3,</i>
<i>which is to the left hand side.</i>

216
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:37,525
<i>It's Hamilton, Vettel, you.</i>

217
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,125
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

218
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:44,365
<i> Esteban Ocon's</i>
<i>qualifying performance in Spa</i>

219
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:46,725
<i>was absolutely astonishing.</i>

220
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:50,405
<i>You'd think that he qualified</i>
<i>above everybody,</i>

221
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:53,525
<i>other than Sebastian Vettel</i>
<i>and Lewis Hamilton,</i>

222
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:55,445
who are these two
four-time world champions.

223
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:03,005
<i>Esteban, welcome to the top three.</i>

224
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:06,485
Hi, everyone. Hello.
Thanks for all the support, first of all.

225
00:14:07,325 --> 00:14:10,125
<i> Well, fairytale for the team,</i>
<i>and for Ocon as well here.</i>

226
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:13,085
<i>The speculations to where he might be</i>
<i>in a few races' time,</i>

227
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:14,565
<i>let alone next season.</i>

228
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,485
<i>There he is,</i>
<i>lining up on the second row.</i>

229
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:20,165
Unfortunately, we're not--

230
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:23,005
We're in a place in Formula One
where you've got some teams

231
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,205
that rather than take, like,
a new up-and-coming kid

232
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:27,005
they'll take who ever's got the money.

233
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:32,045
But he needs to be in a great car
because he's one of the top drivers here.

234
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,205
So I hope that opportunity
is there for him.

235
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:40,805
<i>So, Force India,</i>
<i>what a month it has been.</i>

236
00:14:40,885 --> 00:14:42,645
<i>They go into administration,</i>

237
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:45,485
<i>they get rescued, they get taken over,</i>

238
00:14:45,565 --> 00:14:49,405
<i>they come to Spa,</i>
<i>and they lock out the second row.</i>

239
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:53,045
<i>No driver likes to be beaten</i>
<i>by their teammate.</i>

240
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,645
<i>They're the first reference.</i>
<i>They're in the same car,</i>

241
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,725
<i>and that's the person you've got to beat.</i>

242
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:00,565
<i>So someone like Sergio Perez,</i>
<i>if he's getting out-qualified</i>

243
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:02,645
by Esteban Ocon,
that's gonna really hurt

244
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:04,925
because this is a guy
with less experience,

245
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,205
but maybe he's showing
he's got more potential.

246
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:18,005
<i> We're minutes away from</i>
<i>racing here at the Singapore Grand Prix.</i>

247
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:24,805
<i>Since the start of the season,</i>

248
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:28,005
<i>Esteban Ocon has out-qualified</i>
<i>his teammate</i>

249
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:29,845
<i>eleven times to four.</i>

250
00:15:30,085 --> 00:15:33,565
<i>So Sergio Perez really needs</i>
<i>a good result tonight.</i>

251
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,445
<i> It's a good start</i>
<i>for Esteban Ocon.</i>

252
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:58,085
<i>Two Force Indias together again,</i>
<i>they're going wheel-to-wheel.</i>

253
00:16:03,405 --> 00:16:05,845
<i>Into the wall goes Esteban Ocon!</i>

254
00:16:08,325 --> 00:16:11,685
<i>I got hit by Sergio badly. Badly, badly.</i>

255
00:16:15,205 --> 00:16:17,365
<i> Sorry, guys, there was no room.</i>

256
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:20,885
<i>I basically did not even see him.</i>

257
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:24,525
<i>It's Baku from last year.</i>

258
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:27,605
<i>It's Spa from last year all over again.</i>

259
00:16:27,685 --> 00:16:32,525
<i>And it's Ocon who is squeezed</i>
<i>into the wall by his teammate.</i>

260
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,525
<i> Esteban's car's in the wall,</i>

261
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:39,165
<i>thanks to Sergio,</i>
<i>on the first lap of the race.</i>

262
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:40,525
It's utterly unforgivable.

263
00:16:41,485 --> 00:16:43,805
Esteban, awful to see you
back here in the pit lane.

264
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:44,805
What happened?

265
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,685
Well, I think it's clear, and I think
everyone saw what happened.

266
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,445
I'm not gonna comment yet.

267
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:52,285
I want to see the images
and discuss with the team first,

268
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:54,085
so, uh, we'll see.

269
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:55,605
Thanks very much.

270
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,205
<i>I think, "I'm not gonna comment,"</i>

271
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,805
<i>probably says more than Esteban Ocon</i>
<i>really wants to give away.</i>

272
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:11,325
<i>So one Force India car out of the race,</i>

273
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,605
<i>can Sergio Perez rescue some points</i>
<i>for the team?</i>

274
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:20,925
<i> Checo, Sirotkin ahead.</i>
<i>We will need to overtake him.</i>

275
00:17:23,885 --> 00:17:26,125
<i> Is he gonna go for it?</i>
<i>Down the inside maybe?</i>

276
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:30,485
<i>No. Sergio Perez very nearly ran</i>
<i>into the back of Sergey Sirotkin.</i>

277
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:37,205
<i> Man, Sirotkin is moving</i>
<i>so much on the braking. Too much, man.</i>

278
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:39,925
<i>He's vastly experienced, Martin,</i>

279
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:44,085
<i>but we're starting to see</i>
<i>increasing desperation from the Mexican.</i>

280
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:50,405
<i>This is a joke, really.</i>
<i>Do you really want me to crash?</i>

281
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:54,885
<i>Perez's frustration</i>
<i>was so evident to see,</i>

282
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,245
<i>but is that frustration</i>
<i>with Sirotkin in the race,</i>

283
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:01,245
or is it a deeper frustration
in him not yet knowing his future?

284
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:17,805
<i>Sergio Perez finally finds a way</i>
<i> past Sergey Sirotkin.</i>

285
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:20,645
<i>- It's not gonna be easy.</i>
<i>- Or does he?</i>

286
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,165
<i>They're still going through this.</i>

287
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:27,845
<i>Oh, no! They've managed to crash.</i>

288
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:31,845
<i>Perez has got severe damage.</i>

289
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,285
<i> Left rear puncture. Box. Box.</i>

290
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,045
<i>I wonder if that was just angry.</i>
<i>He was driving angry.</i>

291
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:45,925
Singapore was, I think,
a very visual representation

292
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,925
of what's going on in Sergio Perez's head.

293
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:50,485
<i> I tried to close the door</i>
<i>before braking,</i>

294
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:52,565
<i>but obviously he doesn't move at all</i>

295
00:18:52,645 --> 00:18:56,405
and I probably...
I was over optimistic there.

296
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:00,885
<i>He looked like a rookie,</i>
<i>completely losing his marbles.</i>

297
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:04,845
He needs to be impressing the team
and showing that he can be a leader,

298
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:07,845
<i>not that he's gonna fall apart</i>
<i>when things don't quite look</i>

299
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,365
<i>like they're going his way.</i>

300
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:14,805
<i> A very disappointing night indeed</i>
<i>for the Force India team.</i>

301
00:19:15,925 --> 00:19:19,805
We will have no points for both cars,
so, yeah, it's a terrible weekend.

302
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:36,005
Better.

303
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:38,365
<i>Now it is a crucial time.</i>

304
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:42,285
<i>After the last race,</i>
<i>I have to score a lot of points.</i>

305
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:46,445
<i>I hope I can finish on a high</i>
<i>to get the seat for next year.</i>

306
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:51,165
<i>I don't count time, I don't count hours.</i>

307
00:19:51,245 --> 00:19:53,525
<i>It doesn't matter if it's Christmas,</i>
<i>New Year, holidays,</i>

308
00:19:54,085 --> 00:19:59,325
<i>because the most important thing in sport</i>
<i>is to perform and is to do a great job</i>

309
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:01,245
<i>and to be different than the others.</i>

310
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,805
<i>There's nothing else that counts.</i>

311
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:07,205
<i>You push to be the best you can, you know.</i>

312
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:10,365
<i>I've dreamed of this as a kid,</i>
<i>pushing every day,</i>

313
00:20:10,445 --> 00:20:13,285
<i>waking up with the same target,</i>
<i>the same goal.</i>

314
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:18,005
<i>I'm not gonna let anything</i>
<i>in between me and the performance.</i>

315
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:21,205
<i>I'm just gonna work harder,</i>
<i>and I think that always pays off.</i>

316
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:34,845
<i>We're here in Mexico City</i>
<i>for the start of the Mexican Grand Prix.</i>

317
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,205
Can you hear the crowd cheering?

318
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:43,125
<i>It's a huge race</i>
<i>for home favorite Sergio Perez.</i>

319
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:47,165
<i>And there's some big news for his team,</i>
<i>Racing Point Force India.</i>

320
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:49,805
<i>After months of speculation,</i>

321
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:52,885
<i>they've announced their driver</i>
<i>lineup for next season.</i>

322
00:20:56,485 --> 00:21:01,445
In 2019, we'll have Lance Stroll
and Sergio Perez

323
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,325
as our two racecar drivers.

324
00:21:09,805 --> 00:21:13,845
Next year, my situation is still,
you know, quite blurry.

325
00:21:13,925 --> 00:21:17,085
I don't really know what, uh--
what I will be doing.

326
00:21:18,525 --> 00:21:23,165
I don't really understand how
that has gone from being a dream situation

327
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:24,725
to that situation now.

328
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:33,165
<i>We saw talent in Sergio,</i>

329
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:35,245
<i>and, yes, he came</i>
<i>with the backing of Carlos Slim,</i>

330
00:21:35,325 --> 00:21:37,765
<i>so for us, it was an added benefit</i>

331
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:40,845
<i>because funding</i>
<i>does correlate highly to performance</i>

332
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,125
<i>and we need all the funding we can get.</i>

333
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:46,605
<i>But first and foremost,</i>
<i>he's there because of his talent.</i>

334
00:21:56,845 --> 00:22:02,805
What I don't understand is that all
the things can be above performance,

335
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:05,085
<i>above motivation, above work.</i>

336
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:12,925
Checo has a helicopter
from the hotel to the track.

337
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:17,285
But, yeah, I'm not at this level yet.

338
00:22:17,725 --> 00:22:20,285
But, yeah, he's there on the massive sign.
Do you see?

339
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:22,365
He's everywhere.

340
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:25,605
He looks happy.

341
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:30,605
Checo, Checo!

342
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:34,485
Checo!

343
00:22:34,565 --> 00:22:38,085
<i> I'm giving it all my heart</i>
<i>to be here and I'm giving it all I can,</i>

344
00:22:38,165 --> 00:22:41,405
<i>but unfortunately, there's</i>
<i>other things that comes in play</i>

345
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:44,005
<i>and that's what</i>
<i>I don't really understand</i>

346
00:22:44,085 --> 00:22:45,805
<i>and that's</i>
<i>what disappoints me a bit so far.</i>

347
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,765
Are you looking forward
to driving with Lance?

348
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:57,565
It's just the lack of opportunities
that this sport offers, you know?

349
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:58,965
We only have twenty seats.

350
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:04,245
<i>It just happens, you know?</i>

351
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,565
One day, it's gonna be me...

352
00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:24,325
<i>Just listen to the crowd.</i>

353
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:26,925
<i>It's race day here</i>
<i>at the Mexican Grand Prix.</i>

354
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:32,925
<i>Fingers crossed.</i>

355
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:35,925
<i>And I'm sure the whole of Mexico</i>
<i>are keeping their fingers crossed</i>

356
00:23:36,005 --> 00:23:40,045
<i>for Sergio Perez, who fancies his chances</i>
<i>for a really strong points finish</i>

357
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,405
<i>in today's race.</i>

358
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:46,685
<i> I think very few drivers</i>
<i>in the world</i>

359
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:50,485
<i>get to experience that amount of support</i>
<i>from their countries.</i>

360
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:53,125
It is another pressure.

361
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:56,725
You try to be perfect
and you really work hard

362
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:59,965
and you really try to focus
on your thing.

363
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,805
<i>No love lost between Sergio Perez</i>
<i>and his teammate, Esteban Ocon.</i>

364
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,805
<i>I'm sure Ocon will want to prove</i>
<i>what he's made of</i>

365
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:10,365
<i>before he leaves Force India.</i>

366
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:14,925
To beat Checo in Mexico,
it's one of your goals here?

367
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:19,365
Well, my goal is to do the best I can.
So, um, yeah, it is.

368
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:22,965
<i>Esteban Ocon has only got</i>
<i>a few races left this season</i>

369
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,845
<i>to deliver the results</i>
<i>that convinces another team</i>

370
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,405
to put him in for 2019.

371
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:29,245
So right now, he's driving for his career.

372
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:33,725
Rumors certainly starting to circulate
that Esteban may be within a shot,

373
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,525
a chance of that final seat at Williams.

374
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:39,845
<i> And this is the way it looks.</i>

375
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:42,805
<i>Ricciardo on pole,</i>
<i>Verstappen in second,</i>

376
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:45,245
<i>Lewis Hamilton starts third.</i>

377
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:49,245
<i>And Hamilton driving</i>
<i>for the driver's championship.</i>

378
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:54,725
<i>If he finishes seventh or higher,</i>
<i>he'll become a five-times world champion.</i>

379
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,485
<i>Esteban Ocon starts eleventh.</i>

380
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:04,405
<i>Ocon out-qualifying Sergio Perez,</i>
<i>who starts thirteenth.</i>

381
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,485
<i> Sergio Perez, the local hero.</i>

382
00:25:08,565 --> 00:25:12,485
<i>There's a man who looks like</i>
<i>he's carrying a lot of anticipation,</i>

383
00:25:12,565 --> 00:25:13,965
<i>hope, and stress.</i>

384
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:28,445
<i>It's the dash down</i>
<i>to turn one then.</i>

385
00:25:28,525 --> 00:25:30,125
<i>Who's gonna come out on top?</i>

386
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:32,445
<i>So far, all getting away freely.</i>

387
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:38,125
<i>Esteban Ocon and Hülkenberg</i>
<i>going wheel-to-wheel.</i>

388
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:39,965
<i>And there's damage.</i>

389
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:53,525
<i> I have damaged front wing.</i>

390
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:59,285
<i>You will be pitting, Esteban.</i>
<i>You will be pitting.</i>

391
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:01,045
<i>You have half the front wing missing.</i>

392
00:26:02,925 --> 00:26:04,005
<i>Copy.</i>

393
00:26:05,925 --> 00:26:08,285
<i> Ocon already into the pits.</i>

394
00:26:08,365 --> 00:26:11,525
<i>He's gone from eleventh to last</i>
<i>in three corners.</i>

395
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:26,485
<i> It's hard at that moment</i>
<i>when you go off of the track.</i>

396
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:31,925
<i>Even if the guys are really quick,</i>
<i>it's a lot of seconds lost.</i>

397
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:38,245
<i>I knew I had to catch up</i>
<i>and get back in the race.</i>

398
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:45,165
<i>Nightmare start for Ocon,</i>
<i>but he's back out.</i>

399
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:47,365
<i>How far can he climb</i>
<i>back up the order?</i>

400
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:54,525
Checo, your pace is at least as good
as the cars behind, if not better.

401
00:26:57,245 --> 00:27:00,765
<i>Yeah, I think I can be</i>
<i>one second quicker than this.</i>

402
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,485
<i>At that point in the race,</i>

403
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,525
<i>I was focused on trying</i>
<i>to achieve the best I possibly could.</i>

404
00:27:12,405 --> 00:27:15,005
<i>Here goes Sergio Perez,</i>
<i>running in eleventh place.</i>

405
00:27:16,485 --> 00:27:20,445
<i>Sergio Perez is having a go.</i>
<i>Swoops round the outside.</i>

406
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:26,325
<i>Sergio Perez has got his man</i>
<i>and Mexico stands and applauds.</i>

407
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:29,165
<i>Brilliant moving, brilliant overtaking.</i>

408
00:27:32,285 --> 00:27:35,245
<i>So, Esteban, we need to be</i>
<i>pushing up to Sirotkin</i>

409
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:37,045
<i>as much as possible now.</i>

410
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:41,245
<i>Ocon in the Force India</i>
<i>running in 16th.</i>

411
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:44,525
<i>He has got a long, long way</i>
<i>to go to recover the damage</i>

412
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:46,005
<i>from the opening few laps.</i>

413
00:27:46,085 --> 00:27:48,165
<i>Now he's behind Sergey Sirotkin</i>
<i>in the Williams.</i>

414
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:50,885
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>I knew I had to push hard.</i>

415
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:58,245
<i>Ocon might be</i>
<i> going for it with Sirotkin.</i>

416
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:00,765
<i>He is going for it, you know.</i>

417
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:04,045
<i> Well done.</i>

418
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:07,445
<i>Currently, you're ten seconds</i>
<i>behind Perez.</i>

419
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:09,205
<i>Copy.</i>

420
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:15,645
<i>I think Perez is having a go.</i>
<i>Is he gonna try and launch one?</i>

421
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,045
<i>He is, down the outside.</i>

422
00:28:18,045 --> 00:28:20,765
<i>Perez swoops round the outside</i>
<i>of Charles Leclerc.</i>

423
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:22,925
<i>Good job, Checo.</i>

424
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:26,765
<i>And he is now up</i>
<i>into eighth place.</i>

425
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:34,765
<i>I was doing</i>
<i>a great, fantastic race.</i>

426
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:40,445
<i>And I was very lucky to have</i>
<i>such a country behind me.</i>

427
00:28:41,365 --> 00:28:45,205
Checo, Checo, Checo, Checo, Checo!

428
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:49,125
<i>But then things changed quickly.</i>

429
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:53,365
<i>I have a problem.</i>

430
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:56,765
<i>I have no brake.</i>

431
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:01,045
<i>It's very low. Very, very low.</i>

432
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,525
<i>Checo, understood. Understood.</i>

433
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:07,805
See if it improves
with a bit of brake-cooling

434
00:29:07,885 --> 00:29:10,125
after you've been behind other cars.

435
00:29:10,205 --> 00:29:12,325
Maybe brake-cooling helps it a bit.

436
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:18,325
<i> What is the problem</i>
<i>with Sergio Perez?</i>

437
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:21,485
<i>Kevin Magnussen is closing in</i>
<i>in the Haas behind.</i>

438
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,205
<i>Magnussen looks to the outside</i>
<i>and Perez with a big twitch!</i>

439
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:29,405
<i>He can barely get the car slowed down.</i>

440
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:31,765
<i> I have no fucking brake, man.</i>

441
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:38,245
<i>And here comes Esteban Ocon.</i>
<i>Still in 15th place.</i>

442
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,085
<i>What's going on?</i>

443
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:43,925
<i> Perez has a problem ahead</i>
<i>with brakes.</i>

444
00:29:44,685 --> 00:29:45,565
<i> Copy.</i>

445
00:29:46,805 --> 00:29:49,165
<i>Ocon hunting down his teammate.</i>

446
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:53,405
<i>Sergio Perez losing out to Ericsson</i>
<i>and sliding wide again.</i>

447
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:55,925
<i>Surely the race is over</i>
<i>for the Mexican.</i>

448
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:59,565
<i>After a tough start,</i>
<i>Ocon in front of his teammate.</i>

449
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:06,205
<i>Checo, we're gonna have to retire.</i>
<i>We're gonna have to retire.</i>

450
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,405
<i>Caution stopping.</i>

451
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:12,165
<i>Look out for the guys.</i>
<i>We'll stop you in the pit lane.</i>

452
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:17,165
<i>And Perez has come into the pits.</i>

453
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:20,605
<i>The first time ever Sergio Perez</i>
<i>retires from his home Grand Prix.</i>

454
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:23,525
<i>That is just tragic.</i>

455
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:32,205
<i>It was really hard, you know,</i>
<i>difficult to digest.</i>

456
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:38,205
<i>You work the whole weekend so hard</i>
<i>with the team.</i>

457
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,645
<i>And, yeah, unfortunately</i>
<i>we get that issue.</i>

458
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:53,565
<i>I have all of my family,</i>
<i>all of my people there.</i>

459
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:55,325
<i>My whole country is watching me.</i>

460
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,245
<i>And they all want me</i>
<i>to do incredibly well.</i>

461
00:31:01,085 --> 00:31:02,605
It was very tough.

462
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:10,685
<i>And here comes Hamilton</i>
<i>in fourth place at the moment.</i>

463
00:31:11,445 --> 00:31:14,325
<i>He will become champion</i>
<i>as it stands now.</i>

464
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:17,325
<i>So, Esteban, keep pushing.</i>

465
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:21,045
<i> There's Esteban Ocon</i>
<i>in the Force India.</i>

466
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:22,805
<i>He's really going for it here.</i>

467
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:29,205
<i>This is a great blast towards turn one.</i>

468
00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:32,645
<i>Ocon looking to the outside</i>
<i>of Hartley.</i>

469
00:31:32,725 --> 00:31:34,285
<i>Late on the brakes.</i>

470
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:36,405
<i>Wheel to wheel...</i>

471
00:31:37,405 --> 00:31:39,885
<i>And they make contact.</i>
<i>They've gone into each other.</i>

472
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,965
<i>A puff of smoke there</i>
<i>from the rear of that Toro Rosso.</i>

473
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:48,125
<i>Oh, no.</i>

474
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:56,045
<i>Debris all over the track too</i>
<i>from the back of the Toro Rosso.</i>

475
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:58,165
<i> I don't know if I have damage</i>
<i>in the front or not.</i>

476
00:31:58,925 --> 00:32:01,485
<i>Ah, fucking hell,</i>
<i>nothing is going well in this race.</i>

477
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:06,765
<i> I think we have</i>
<i>some more damage on the car, Esteban.</i>

478
00:32:07,645 --> 00:32:08,965
<i>Copy that. Any advice?</i>

479
00:32:09,445 --> 00:32:13,165
<i>We really need to try</i>
<i>and catch up the group if we can.</i>

480
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,085
<i>So it's head down and let's push.</i>

481
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:17,645
<i> Copy.</i>

482
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:28,325
<i> Gasly behind.</i>
<i>So watch out for Gasly.</i>

483
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,005
<i> Onboard now with Pierre Gasly.</i>

484
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,005
<i>Is he gonna try and launch one?</i>
<i>He is down the outside.</i>

485
00:32:39,205 --> 00:32:41,405
<i>They come close but they don't touch.</i>

486
00:32:42,285 --> 00:32:44,965
<i> Ocon there</i>
<i>fighting for his racing career.</i>

487
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:52,445
In my head I was like,
"Focus, try to do the best you can."

488
00:32:53,525 --> 00:32:56,485
<i>Ocon and Hartley</i>
<i>at 220 miles an hour.</i>

489
00:32:56,605 --> 00:32:57,925
<i>And Ocon is through.</i>

490
00:32:58,005 --> 00:33:01,405
-Go on. Go on.
<i>-He is now up into eleventh place.</i>

491
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:06,125
<i>Well done, three laps to go.</i>

492
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:11,285
<i>But all eyes now on Lewis Hamilton.</i>

493
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,645
<i>The man from Stevenage</i>
<i>has done it once again.</i>

494
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:18,485
<i>A five-time champion of the world!</i>

495
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:25,325
<i> Okay, checkered flag.</i>

496
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,285
<i>Well done.</i>

497
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:34,925
<i>And Esteban Ocon crosses the line</i>
<i>to finish in eleventh place.</i>

498
00:33:39,005 --> 00:33:41,965
<i> The fact that Esteban</i>
<i>came home 11th in Mexico,</i>

499
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:44,485
I think, tells you everything
about the guy.

500
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:48,125
<i>He took contact on the first lap,</i>
<i>and, yeah, he made contact later on</i>

501
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:51,165
<i>in the race, and many drivers</i>
<i>might have retired the car,</i>

502
00:33:51,245 --> 00:33:52,725
<i>but he still brought it home.</i>

503
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,565
<i>I find it hard to believe</i>

504
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:59,365
<i>that Esteban could end up</i>
<i>out of a seat for next season.</i>

505
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,485
<i>My goal has always been</i>
<i>to be a Formula One driver.</i>

506
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:11,925
<i>You know, I've dreamed of this as a kid.</i>

507
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:25,565
<i>And now, you know,</i>
<i>I still have no seat for next year.</i>

508
00:34:31,045 --> 00:34:33,565
I mean, as a sportsman,
first you have to believe in yourself,

509
00:34:33,645 --> 00:34:37,205
<i>but it hasn't been easy, for sure.</i>

510
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:42,685
But I hope, yeah, people will remember
what I did the last two years.
