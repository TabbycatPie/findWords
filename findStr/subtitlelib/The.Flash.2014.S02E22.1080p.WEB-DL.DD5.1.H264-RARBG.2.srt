1
00:00:01,548 --> 00:00:02,814
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,050
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:07,410
To the outside world,

4
00:00:07,478 --> 00:00:09,595
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

5
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:12,598
But secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,901
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:17,937
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

8
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:21,774
but in doing so I opened up
our world to new threats.

9
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:25,160
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

10
00:00:25,162 --> 00:00:28,113
I am The Flash.

11
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,533
Previously on "The Flash"...

12
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:30,964
Welcome to Earth-2.

13
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:33,099
I met your doppelganger.
She's a cold-hearted

14
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,767
ice queen named Killer Frost.

15
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:36,853
- The name is Vibe.
- Reverb.

16
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:39,639
My brothers and sisters,

17
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,558
I've brought us to this new world,

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,894
ours for the taking!

19
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:46,896
Whose world is this?

20
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:50,149
Our world! Our world!

21
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:52,986
Our world, our world!

22
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:10,169
Reloading!

23
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:15,641
Ah!

24
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,510
David!

25
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,645
Back door! Captain's down.

26
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,898
Go, go, go, go, go!

27
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:30,023
Down, down! Down, get down!

28
00:01:45,457 --> 00:01:48,508
Some people are calling
it the metapocalypse,

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,045
the days when Central City
was overrun by an army

30
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,547
with powers beyond imagination.

31
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:58,051
But in these dark times,

32
00:01:58,053 --> 00:02:00,970
we must never forget our own strength,

33
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,107
our own power to fight back.

34
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,942
That it is only in the blackest of nights

35
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:13,329
that we can truly see the light...

36
00:02:13,331 --> 00:02:16,699
and know for sure we are not alone.

37
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:20,870
We are never... ever... alone.

39
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:28,460
We usually take these guys
down one at a time,

40
00:02:28,462 --> 00:02:30,379
not 100 at a time.

41
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:32,464
And yet, you don't seem overwhelmed.

42
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:34,300
I know we can do it.

43
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:37,136
Guys. You have to come see this.

44
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:39,889
Cisco, what are you...

45
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,223
Caitlin?

46
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:43,893
She's in shock.

47
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:46,862
A little... dehydrated and malnourished,

48
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:48,981
but I think she'll be fine.

49
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,116
I'm okay.

50
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:53,202
What happened? How did you get away?

51
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:56,705
He... let me go.

52
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:59,158
I didn't think he would;
I thought it was a trap.

53
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,411
But... he told me you were dead.

54
00:03:02,413 --> 00:03:04,129
I'm not. I'm right here.

55
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:07,466
We're all here, together.

56
00:03:07,468 --> 00:03:09,084
Snow.

57
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,336
Jay's not here.

58
00:03:10,338 --> 00:03:12,421
You're safe.

59
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:15,507
He's gonna overrun the city.
You can't stop him.

60
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:17,092
Yes, we can.

61
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:19,178
Listen to me, he's not going to succeed.

62
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,063
We've got this. This is our Earth.

63
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:22,264
You don't know that.

64
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:23,482
You don't know what he is capable of.

65
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:25,935
I know from being in the Speed Force

66
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:28,854
that the universe is with us, not Zoom.

67
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:31,690
And if the universe is with us,
how could we possibly lose?

68
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:33,192
Right, guys?

69
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:34,777
Yeah, yeah, right.

70
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:38,330
You've been through a lot.

71
00:03:38,332 --> 00:03:39,782
You should get some rest, come on.

72
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:43,035
You were in the Speed Force?

73
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:44,954
I... when you were gone.

74
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:47,923
It's hard to explain, but we
tried to get my powers back

75
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,292
and when the dark matter lightning...

76
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:52,127
Okay, I'm gonna say it.

77
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:55,764
Um, we don't think he's being
just a little too...

78
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:57,182
Overconfident?

79
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:59,268
Yeah, maybe it was
his time in the Speed Force.

80
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,021
I mean, he's acting like he's
invincible now or something.

81
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,973
Yeah, like nothing fazes
him anymore, which isn't...

82
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:05,691
Realistic, no.

83
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:08,477
Somebody needs to talk to him
before letting his guard down

84
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,279
gets him hurt or worse.

85
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,314
He did bring me out of my coma.

86
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:14,783
That's bound to make someone
a little overly chipper.

87
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:18,570
Well, like I said, somebody
needs to talk to him.

88
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,679
Amazing job, Anupam.

89
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:23,065
This is exactly the kind of
groundbreaking thinking

90
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:25,184
I built this company for.

91
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:26,602
Well done.

92
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,851
Everyone, evacuate! Now!

93
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:01,804
Hurry!

94
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:13,198
Hey.

95
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,317
She's out like a light, huh?

96
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,652
Yeah.

97
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:18,620
Jay really did a number on her.

98
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:20,155
It's not like he

99
00:05:20,157 --> 00:05:24,459
exactly used kid gloves on the rest of us.

100
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:26,962
She'll be okay. She just needs time.

101
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:29,331
And for us to finally bring Zoom down.

102
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,166
Which we will.

103
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:35,304
Yeah, because the universe
is with us, right?

104
00:05:36,724 --> 00:05:37,806
Listen, man...

105
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:55,824
Cisco?

106
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:57,743
Hey. You okay?

107
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,361
- You just vibe?
- Yeah.

108
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:01,580
What'd you see?

109
00:06:01,582 --> 00:06:04,449
I saw a bird.

110
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,168
Like, a dead bird.

111
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:14,259
Mercury Labs.

112
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:15,794
It's under attack.

113
00:06:15,796 --> 00:06:16,979
All right.

114
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:10,899
Thank you, Mr. Allen.

115
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:14,102
I'm not stupid.

116
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,410
Boom.

117
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,240
So how did you know?

118
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,741
- Your real identity?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,026
Come on, Barry, I'm a scientist.

120
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,444
We're paid to be perceptive.

121
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,646
And you're always a little too well informed

122
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:39,249
when things go pear-shaped in this city.

123
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,700
But I don't believe we've ever met before.

124
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:42,168
Dr. Christina McGee.

125
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,370
Doctor Henry Allen.

126
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:44,788
I'm Barry's father.

127
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,039
Okay, now that the cat's out of the bag,

128
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,340
did you happen to see who it was

129
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,925
that cause your building to collapse?

130
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,877
I didn't see anything. It happened so fast.

131
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,213
Maybe the security cameras caught something?

132
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,098
Can we access them?

133
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,351
Mercury Labs does have a
Crash-Survivable Memory Unit.

134
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,719
A what?

135
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:01,938
Virtually a black box for buildings.

136
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,523
It will have stored all the security footage

137
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,275
right up until the building collapsed.

138
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:06,860
Okay, great, I'll go find it.

139
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,895
This wasn't some random meta-human.

140
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:11,197
Whenever Mercury Labs has been targeted

141
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,316
in the past there's always
been a specific reason.

142
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:15,368
Yeah, someone's after something.

143
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,486
Yes, and that someone

144
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:18,705
is probably Zoom.

145
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:20,624
There may be one more possibility.

146
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,542
A few months ago, I saw Harrison Wells

147
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,244
running out of my facility.

148
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,413
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm certain it was him.

149
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:29,633
Is there any way he could
have anything to do with this?

150
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,217
A few months ago?

151
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,836
Sure.

152
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:34,304
Now?

153
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,006
No.

154
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:38,508
Yeah, there are a few
more things that we could

155
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,226
catch you up on, Dr. McGee.

156
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,151
Hey, my purse!

157
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:02,699
That ain't yours, punk.

158
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:04,250
Big mistake.

159
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,253
You picked a bad time to play hero.

160
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:23,436
Dad?

161
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:29,476
Wally.

162
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:31,394
What the hell were you doing?

163
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:32,896
That guy just jacked a bunch of people

164
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:34,197
so I had to go after him.

165
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,149
You could have got yourself killed!

166
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:37,951
I'm not just gonna let
these guys get away with this.

167
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:39,069
I have to do something.

168
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,820
Wally, these are not just guys!

169
00:09:40,822 --> 00:09:42,038
These are meta-humans!

170
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,873
Leaves this to the cops and The Flash.

171
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,492
The Flash can't be everywhere at once.

172
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:47,877
I... I have to do what I can to help.

173
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,580
I have to show him I was worth being saved.

174
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,252
Wally...

175
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,674
You are... worth it.

176
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:03,677
Really?

177
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,146
Am I?

178
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:08,481
'Cause last time I checked,
I'm the guy who avoided

179
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,767
his dying mother for weeks.

180
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,235
I'm the guy who shamed a bunch of other guys

181
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,154
and illegally took their cars from them.

182
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,856
I'm the guy who caused The Flash
to lose his powers and start

183
00:10:16,858 --> 00:10:19,025
this whole damn "metapocalypse"
in the first place.

184
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:20,243
Wally...

185
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,579
Last time I checked,

186
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:26,032
I've a whole lot to make up for.

187
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:28,168
That's what I intend to do.

188
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:35,959
Damn it.

189
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,350
Snow.

190
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,885
Oh.

191
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,220
I didn't know you were here.

192
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:48,555
What you doing?

193
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:50,273
Uh... Jesse asked me to run some tests

194
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:55,278
to see if her genetic structure had changed.

195
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,398
Why did you ask Dr. Snow...

196
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,283
to run tests on you again?

197
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,068
Because I got hit with a dark matter, okay?

198
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:04,404
I mean, that must have affected me somehow.

199
00:11:14,249 --> 00:11:17,417
You're not a meta-human.

200
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:19,219
What you are

201
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,420
is a young woman

202
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:23,473
with a genius-level IQ that we could use

203
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:28,094
in our fight against
this new wave of meta-humans.

204
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,430
Okay. All right, fine.

205
00:11:30,432 --> 00:11:32,182
Fine.

206
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,941
Snow?

207
00:11:41,943 --> 00:11:44,778
You all right?

208
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,780
Yeah, I'm fine.

209
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:57,340
- Is this it?
- That's the one.

210
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,176
All right, great. Dad, Dr. McGee, Cisco.

211
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,294
Why don't you guys crack this open,

212
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:02,962
- see what you can find?
- Sure.

213
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:04,547
We'll go see what kind of meta-human powers

214
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,132
can take down a building
like that and how to stop it.

215
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:07,884
- Great.
- Sounds like fun.

216
00:12:07,886 --> 00:12:10,303
All right, I'm gonna go see
if Joe needs any help

217
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:11,938
in the streets. Everybody cool here?

218
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,390
Should be a piece of cake, right?

219
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,978
- Hey, slugger!
- Hey.

220
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,364
Can I talk to you for a minute?

221
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,448
Yeah, sure.

222
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,117
What's up?

223
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,735
Well, I know you said that

224
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:28,121
what happened to you in the Speed Force

225
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,990
changed the way you see things,

226
00:12:30,992 --> 00:12:33,459
but you seem very optimistic,
you know, with a lot

227
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,829
of meta-humans running around
tearing up the city.

228
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,964
What, did you see the future in there?

229
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,667
No... um... not this time.

230
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,085
No... I... look...

231
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:45,088
What I was shown in the Speed Force

232
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,390
didn't just change my mind,

233
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,843
it changed me.

234
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,645
I don't know...
what you're seeing as optimism

235
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,481
is, for the first time,

236
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,184
I'm just not afraid anymore.

237
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,656
Great, that's...

238
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,242
But...

239
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,362
You know you still
have to be careful, right?

240
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:11,164
What do you mean?

241
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,332
Well...

242
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,668
I don't... why are you trying to

243
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,338
take something from me
that I fought so hard to get to?

244
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,423
- Barry!
- I... you... you don't know

245
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,091
everything that I've been through, Dad.

246
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,127
You haven't been here long enough to know.

247
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,013
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

248
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,348
I don't know why I said that.

249
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,350
I think I do.

250
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:32,435
Hadn't been around.

251
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,355
Teach you how to drive
or take you to look at colleges.

252
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,689
But I've done everything in my power

253
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,225
to know who you are.

254
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:40,977
Barry, I don't want to
take anything from you.

255
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,313
I believe in you.

256
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:45,448
This isn't about my not believing in you.

257
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,283
I know that.

258
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,786
And I'm fine. Okay?

259
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,571
Thank you, thank you very much

260
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:52,989
for worrying about me.

261
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,158
I love you.

262
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,493
But I'm fine.

263
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,416
Come on.

264
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,923
What is that?

265
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:12,392
It's CCPD.

266
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,509
Zoom.

267
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:14,594
Barry.

268
00:14:14,596 --> 00:14:15,595
Don't do it.

269
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:25,271
You know, I never saw the crime photos

270
00:14:25,273 --> 00:14:27,991
of my mother's murder.

271
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,943
Well, I guess I didn't need to.

272
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:35,281
I have a ringside seat
while you got whisked away.

273
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:36,582
Too delicate, I suppose.

274
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:43,039
Not just a hologram after all,
are you, Flash?

275
00:14:46,544 --> 00:14:48,711
Interesting.

276
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:54,100
I know you didn't
call me up here just to banter.

277
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,768
Let's finish this.

278
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,387
Right now.

279
00:14:57,389 --> 00:14:59,305
Actually, I did.

280
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:01,724
I called you up here to
tell you you can't keep running

281
00:15:01,726 --> 00:15:04,060
from one meta to the next.

282
00:15:04,062 --> 00:15:05,895
Around and around,

283
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:08,614
like a dog chasing its tail.

284
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,233
I'll do whatever it takes to stop you.

285
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:13,319
If only that were good enough.

286
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:15,371
'Cause here's the thing.

287
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,457
I know you.

288
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,827
I know you, I know what's holding you back.

289
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:24,580
You and me...

290
00:15:24,582 --> 00:15:26,132
we're really just the same person.

291
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:29,836
Yeah, you keep saying that,

292
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:31,421
but it's not gonna make it true.

293
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:33,973
You'll see. We are.

294
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,011
Same tragic background.

295
00:15:38,013 --> 00:15:39,846
Same reason for running.

296
00:15:39,848 --> 00:15:43,399
Same desire to be the fastest,
to be the best.

297
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,984
The difference?

298
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:47,103
You think your anger is dirty somehow.

299
00:15:47,105 --> 00:15:49,939
You want to be seen as pure, the hero.

300
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:52,191
Doesn't it get exhausting?

301
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:53,826
Doesn't it get exhausting, Barry!

302
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,529
It was exhausting playing Jay, believe me.

303
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:57,697
I'm not pretending.

304
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:03,252
Now if it were me,

305
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,204
I'd let that building tumble
without a second thought.

306
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,539
But you,

307
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:08,841
you'll never let that happen, will you?

308
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:11,761
That's why I'm gonna beat you, Barry.

309
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:15,515
Because you always have to be the hero.

310
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,800
And while you're
playing the good little boy...

311
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:24,474
I'll be busy winning.

312
00:16:31,656 --> 00:16:33,990
We can't let Zoom destroy another building.

313
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,665
We need to take him down.

314
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:39,385
Now.

315
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:41,256
And how do you propose we do that

316
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:43,975
with an army of meta-humans
laying waste to Central City?

317
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,894
We couldn't stop Zoom on my Earth.

318
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,312
What makes us different?

319
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:49,764
We're a team.

320
00:16:49,766 --> 00:16:52,017
We start with the meta-humans,
they're his armor.

321
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,035
We take them down first,
then Zoom's more vulnerable.

322
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:55,270
Barry, we don't even know

323
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:56,855
how many of his minions there are.

324
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,990
There could be hundreds, a thousand.

325
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:01,109
And all of them, they're all
working with different powers.

326
00:17:01,111 --> 00:17:02,744
It could take weeks to track them all down.

327
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,112
Guys, we don't have weeks.

328
00:17:04,114 --> 00:17:05,864
So what we need do to is

329
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,699
come up with a way to stop them all at once.

330
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,701
Again?

331
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:12,120
How?

332
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,338
Cisco,

333
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,373
your goggles, your camera,

334
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,009
they didn't work on Earth-2, right?

335
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,809
Yeah, it was a whole different frequency.

336
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:20,695
And the way you took down the Time Wraiths,

337
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:22,113
that was based on frequency.

338
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,448
Hartley's entire shtick...

339
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,734
I think I'm smelling
what you're stepping in.

340
00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:28,119
- Yeah.
- So basically,

341
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,404
we create some vibrational tech

342
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:31,989
that can take down the Earth-2 metas.

343
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:33,407
- Basically.
- Oh, I gotcha.

344
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:35,326
- Me too.
- I'll help.

345
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:36,544
- Okay.
- I'll let you know

346
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:37,912
if I hear anything from CCPN.

347
00:17:37,914 --> 00:17:41,716
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

348
00:17:41,718 --> 00:17:43,918
You guys...

349
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,337
we got this.

350
00:17:53,513 --> 00:17:55,179
Barr, can I talk to you for a second?

351
00:17:55,181 --> 00:17:56,597
Yeah.

352
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:25,092
Birds.

353
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:26,761
Why?

354
00:18:26,763 --> 00:18:29,597
It's like a Hitchcock movie in my head.

355
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,348
What's up?

356
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,467
Man, it's Wally.

357
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:34,518
Is he okay?

358
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,687
Not really.

359
00:18:36,689 --> 00:18:39,557
Earlier, he thought it would be a good idea

360
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,275
if he used himself

361
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:45,396
as bait against a meta-human psycho.

362
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:47,398
Thought he could do things

363
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,867
the way The Flash would.

364
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,902
Joe, I mean, he... he did tell me that

365
00:18:51,904 --> 00:18:55,239
he wasn't gonna waste the
opportunity The Flash gave him.

366
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:57,158
I don't know if you can stop him.

367
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,743
I'm gonna have to or
he's gonna get himself killed.

368
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:00,878
Look, he ain't you, Barry.

369
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,080
He can't just go Mach 50...

370
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:04,548
Mach 50 isn't a real thing.

371
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,383
The point is

372
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:09,587
thinking you're invincible
isn't any kind of armor.

373
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:12,923
Wally's already at a higher risk
than I'm comfortable with,

374
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:15,342
and him throwing caution to the
wind on top of all that?

375
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,311
No.

376
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:20,731
We got to keep him safe.

377
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:24,185
So... in the Flash,

378
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:26,187
talk to him.

379
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:27,521
Again.

380
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:31,992
Yeah, I'll talk to him. I'll try, I promise.

381
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:34,612
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:35,696
Thank you.

383
00:19:56,018 --> 00:19:57,551
I thought throwing things was

384
00:19:57,553 --> 00:19:59,637
Harry's preferred method
of dealing with stress.

385
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:01,805
That is how frustrated I am right now.

386
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:04,391
I'm... just running out of ideas as to how

387
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:05,976
to make this work. Where's Barry?

388
00:20:05,978 --> 00:20:07,728
I need a taste of that
"Walking on Sunshine" thing

389
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,980
he's got going on right now.

390
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:18,940
No... No!

391
00:20:20,376 --> 00:20:22,209
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

392
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:23,410
It's me, okay?

393
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:25,412
Breathe. Breathe.

394
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:27,798
You're okay, all right? You're shaking.

395
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,216
I... I thought I saw him... Zoom...

396
00:20:29,218 --> 00:20:30,334
I thought I saw him right there.

397
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:31,635
It's just me, okay?

398
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:33,003
Look at me, he's not here.

399
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:35,472
He's not here.

400
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:38,342
I see him everywhere.

401
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,261
Look, you literally

402
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:43,597
just escaped a psychopath
who kidnapped you, all right,

403
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,065
so I think it's normal for you to have

404
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,483
a severe reaction like this.

405
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,652
This is so much worse than that.

406
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:52,573
I... I'm afraid all the time.

407
00:20:52,575 --> 00:20:55,276
I don't think I can ever move forward.

408
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:56,577
You will.

409
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:57,745
When?

410
00:20:57,747 --> 00:21:00,447
Jay took everything from me.

411
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:03,951
My confidence, my trust, my sanity.

412
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:09,707
I don't think I'll ever be whole again.

413
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:13,010
Of course you will.

414
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:15,129
I promise.

415
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:30,394
Stealing is illegal, you know.

416
00:21:32,732 --> 00:21:36,650
Detective West tells me that you've been

417
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:38,485
fighting Zoom's army on your own.

418
00:21:38,487 --> 00:21:42,873
Yeah. I want to help.

419
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,459
I admire what you're trying to do,

420
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:48,746
but the best way to help is to just

421
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:51,248
leave this to the police.

422
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,133
Like you did.

423
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:59,423
I do have powers, Wally.
It is a little different.

424
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:01,892
This isn't your fight.

425
00:22:01,894 --> 00:22:03,260
It's mine.

426
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:05,679
No, it's all of ours.

427
00:22:05,681 --> 00:22:07,564
This is my city too now.

428
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:09,233
It's up to all of us to protect it.

429
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:14,188
Barry, we got a major meta-human alert

430
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,990
at 5th and Main... get there.

431
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:18,409
5th and Main. Got it.

432
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:19,693
We'll continue this later.

433
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:34,258
Why is it always so difficult to choose?

434
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,676
Barry, what it is?

435
00:22:35,678 --> 00:22:37,678
It's...

436
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,213
Laurel Lance.

437
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,918
Laurel.

438
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,954
Laurel Lance is dead.

439
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,707
On this Earth, anyway.

440
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,511
Poor Black Canary. Bye-bye, birdy.

441
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:02,214
Earth-2 Laurel.

442
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:04,299
You knew her doppelganger?

443
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:07,052
We didn't just know her, we loved her.

444
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,223
So... what do I call you?

445
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,858
You can call me

446
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,360
Black Siren.

447
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:18,480
Zoom mentioned that you might be showing up.

448
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,732
If he told you what I can do,

449
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,651
you should look more afraid.

450
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,487
And so should you.

451
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,156
Tell me,

452
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,408
why did you take down Mercury Labs?

453
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,995
Because I like to watch
things crumble and fall.

454
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:37,332
Guess what. You're next, red.

455
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,512
You okay, Barry?

456
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,180
Look.

457
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:54,580
Anything over 200 decibels
will kill a human.

458
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,718
Was that too loud?

459
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,171
Perhaps we should quiet things down a bit.

460
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,517
You know, the sad thing is,

461
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,936
I think Zoom's actually afraid of you.

462
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:19,438
And I didn't think that he feared anything.

463
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,993
And you, you're hardly worth the chills.

464
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,946
How many metas did he send
to try and kill you?

465
00:24:26,948 --> 00:24:27,914
Well, it's too bad.

466
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,448
He should have just sent me

467
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,449
because that way,

468
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:31,450
you would have already been...

469
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:36,672
Get in.

470
00:24:52,774 --> 00:24:54,273
Thought you might need a lift.

471
00:24:54,275 --> 00:24:56,892
Yeah. Thanks.

472
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:03,115
You're welcome.

473
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:11,073
Why do so many villains that we go against

474
00:25:11,075 --> 00:25:13,042
use sound as a weapon?

475
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,794
- What?
- Nothing.

476
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,330
- You're gonna be fine.
- Thanks.

477
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:20,249
So Wally just drove on up
into the thick of it?

478
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:22,668
Mm-hmm.

479
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,004
Must have been some
conversation you two had,

480
00:25:25,006 --> 00:25:27,256
seeing as though he did
literally the opposite

481
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:29,141
of what we wanted.

482
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:30,810
This I can hear.

483
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,511
It's not funny.

484
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:33,512
I'm sorry.

485
00:25:33,514 --> 00:25:35,348
I'm in no laughing mood.

486
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,767
Look, Joe, I tried.

487
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,986
I told you I would try, right? I...

488
00:25:39,988 --> 00:25:42,238
Wally's a determined kid.

489
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,357
Yeah, determined to get himself killed.

490
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,525
Or determined to help people.

491
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:47,994
And be glad, or you know,

492
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:49,495
I would not be standing here right now.

493
00:25:49,497 --> 00:25:51,030
Well, he was lucky tonight.

494
00:25:51,032 --> 00:25:54,166
I don't want to see the day when he isn't.

495
00:25:54,168 --> 00:25:57,169
We've got more than luck on our side, Joe.

496
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:09,548
You know you're not invincible, right?

497
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:14,520
Yes, of course, I know this.

498
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:16,972
Joe's being

499
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:18,474
overprotective, but I get it.

500
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,142
Yeah, but it's like

501
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:23,029
you think that nothing can touch you.

502
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:26,032
Like nothing bad can get in your way.

503
00:26:26,034 --> 00:26:28,818
That's not true for any of us.

504
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,820
What are you saying?

505
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:32,571
Look,

506
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:35,908
I know that you had an
experience in the Speed Force.

507
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,578
And I'm happy that you think
we're gonna win the day.

508
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,915
But I think a little fear
can be a healthy thing.

509
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:46,969
It helps you determine
which risks are worth taking.

510
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:48,254
I think that's something for both

511
00:26:48,256 --> 00:26:49,922
you and Wally to take to heart.

512
00:26:56,597 --> 00:27:00,099
I met your little red friend tonight.

513
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,435
Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?

514
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,737
You didn't.

515
00:27:04,739 --> 00:27:06,439
You're good but not that good.

516
00:27:08,826 --> 00:27:10,860
And yet I seem to be

517
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:13,412
the only one of your top lieutenants

518
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,530
still standing.

519
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,450
Like I said, you're good.

520
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:20,369
So why don't you go
knock down a few more buildings?

521
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,421
Like I ordered.

522
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:23,706
What's the point?

523
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:28,461
The point is so that

524
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,629
it seems random.

525
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:32,631
That way The Flash and his merry band won't

526
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:34,967
realize what I'm up to

527
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,603
till it's too late.

528
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,893
What are you up to?

529
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,896
No good.

530
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:49,815
- Ow.
- Sorry.

531
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:52,201
- Ow!
- There we go.

532
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,486
Are you kidding me with this?

533
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:54,570
Hey, at least it works.

534
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,571
Tremendous.

535
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,956
What is it exactly?

536
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:59,325
It's just a small source of joy,

537
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,327
but more importantly, it's how
we're gonna stop Zoom's army.

538
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:03,162
By giving them all electroshock therapy?

539
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:05,498
By giving them all
dimensional shock therapy.

540
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,501
This is where I play stupid
and you explain science.

541
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:10,252
Okay. Fair enough.

542
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:12,922
So all matter vibrates at
its own unique frequency, right?

543
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,757
You disrupt that frequency,
you disrupt the matter.

544
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,226
Like how an opera singer
shatters glass with her voice.

545
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,844
Exactly. So we found out that

546
00:28:18,846 --> 00:28:20,429
all Earth-2 people vibrate at their own,

547
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:23,682
- more erratic frequency.
- Higher frequency.

548
00:28:23,684 --> 00:28:25,818
- Different frequency.
- Higher.

549
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,187
- Higher frequency than we do.
- Right.

550
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:30,439
So I ran this all past Hartley, right?

551
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:32,825
And he postulated that
we could create a sort of

552
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:35,444
dimensional tuning fork... Voilà...

553
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:37,029
Okay, you didn't do it yourself.

554
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,031
Just let me have this one, okay?

555
00:28:39,033 --> 00:28:40,499
- Have it, have it.
- Thank you.

556
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,084
So if you run around the city

557
00:28:42,086 --> 00:28:44,370
fast enough to create a refracting field,

558
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:46,505
the device can send out

559
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:47,923
a pulse

560
00:28:47,925 --> 00:28:50,342
that'll bounce off of it, split apart,

561
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:52,595
and collide with itself over and over.

562
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,464
Amplifying it to an erratic
frequency on the Earth-2...

563
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:57,049
- Higher. Higher frequency.
- Higher frequency

564
00:28:57,051 --> 00:28:58,551
on the Earth-2 spectrum.

565
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,553
And when that pulse
hits anyone from Earth-2...

566
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:02,605
It'll disrupt their nervous system.

567
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:04,607
Earth-2 metas go night-night.

568
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,475
- Even Zoom?
- Even Zoom.

569
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,394
Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.

570
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:10,062
How do we keep the pulse from hurting them?

571
00:29:10,064 --> 00:29:11,397
Oh, Detective, I didn't know you cared.

572
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:12,865
Yes you did.

573
00:29:12,867 --> 00:29:14,817
Uh, we designed these headphones

574
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,235
to protect us from the pulse.

575
00:29:16,237 --> 00:29:18,070
Beats by Wells.

576
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:22,491
Cisco, it's your meta-human alert app.

577
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,493
That's the high-rise development
on the west side.

578
00:29:24,495 --> 00:29:25,911
Hundreds of people live there.

579
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,796
Ramon, we're up. Let's go.

580
00:29:27,798 --> 00:29:30,466
Set that pulse off right now.
Allen, you need to start

581
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:32,251
generating that refracting field right now.

582
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,303
But Black Siren can take down
this building at any point.

583
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:35,838
Wha... all those people, Wells.

584
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,757
How many more people
are gonna die while we wait?

585
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:40,759
Guys, which is it?

586
00:29:42,396 --> 00:29:45,347
I think I just got
the worst idea of all time.

587
00:29:56,944 --> 00:30:00,863
I don't think I've taken down
so many buildings at once.

588
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:03,415
Maybe you're not as powerful as you think!

589
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:21,133
What are you two doing here?

590
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:24,470
Why should you have all the fun?

591
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:33,515
I thought you two were dead.

592
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,851
Zoom thinks that too.

593
00:30:35,853 --> 00:30:38,420
And we'd like to keep it that way.

594
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,574
For now.

595
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:46,028
You think you two can pull one over on Zoom?

596
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,063
Well, enjoy being dead.

597
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:49,698
I told you.

598
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,501
Give her a chance.

599
00:30:52,503 --> 00:30:53,702
What chance?

600
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:55,704
She's not ready.

601
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,792
Excuse me.

602
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:02,878
Do you know what I'm capable of doing?

603
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,713
Try it, and I'll shatter your entire

604
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:06,932
nervous system without breaking a sweat.

605
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:11,136
Wow, you really think you can take on Zoom.

606
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:14,106
We can.

607
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:16,892
You don't even know how powerful you are.

608
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:20,029
With a single call,
you can take down a building.

609
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:22,948
I'd call that impressive.

610
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,734
But why... stop...

611
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:27,953
there?

612
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:30,823
Why serve a master when you can be a master,

613
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:33,575
when you can be a god?

614
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:38,714
We... could be gods.

615
00:31:45,923 --> 00:31:47,923
- All right!
- All right.

616
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:49,091
We're synced up with whatever

617
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:50,643
the heck that thing is.

618
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:52,227
Finally something we're both baffled by.

619
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:53,812
I'm kidding. That, my friend,

620
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:58,267
is a 75KTSB 40,000-watt
reverberating sound amplifier

621
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:00,185
designed to single out
the operating frequency

622
00:32:00,187 --> 00:32:02,271
of every single Earth-2
being on this planet...

623
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:04,323
which, went contained and magnified

624
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:06,025
by The Flash creating a sound pressure wall

625
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,610
around the city, will render all of us

626
00:32:08,612 --> 00:32:11,413
Earth-2 beings unconscious.

627
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:13,532
Hence...

628
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:16,035
the safety precautions.

629
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,670
I'm baffled by it.

630
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:20,172
Are we ready?

631
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:23,092
- Yes, we are.
- All right.

632
00:32:25,596 --> 00:32:28,514
Here... we...

633
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:30,099
go.

634
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:43,479
If I were interested

635
00:32:43,481 --> 00:32:47,149
in forming an alliance with you two,

636
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:49,318
what's your plan?

637
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:52,237
Exactly?

638
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:55,491
We ambush Zoom at CCPD.

639
00:32:55,493 --> 00:32:56,825
With our three powers combined,

640
00:32:56,827 --> 00:32:58,577
he'll be no match for us.

641
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,662
Hmm.

642
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:03,632
Well, I like the sound of that.

643
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:04,967
Great.

644
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:07,503
Then let's go.

645
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:09,838
There's just one more thing.

646
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:15,344
Reverb... catch.

647
00:33:20,017 --> 00:33:24,019
You know, all doppelgangers...

648
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:25,854
they're mirror images of themselves.

649
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:28,657
But you two, you didn't know that, did you?

650
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:30,659
Reverb is left-handed.

651
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:33,328
Well, I just... I just happened to...

652
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,781
catch it with my right... run!

653
00:33:44,842 --> 00:33:46,458
Oh, no.

654
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,343
What are we gonna do?

655
00:33:48,345 --> 00:33:52,047
I don't think that
there's anything you can do.

656
00:33:55,302 --> 00:33:58,103
What the what?

657
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:59,054
I don't know.

658
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:00,305
Well, do it again!

659
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,029
Cisco...

660
00:34:11,402 --> 00:34:13,235
We're a go.

661
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:23,579
There's nothing on this Earth

662
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:25,964
that can stop us!

663
00:34:30,421 --> 00:34:31,637
It's working.

664
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,976
Yaaaahh!

665
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:40,979
Dad?

666
00:34:40,981 --> 00:34:42,815
Dad, it hurts.

667
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:54,526
- No... no... stop...
- It's okay.

668
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:56,278
- No...
- It's okay, honey.

669
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:15,013
Turn it off! Turn it off, it worked!

670
00:35:16,851 --> 00:35:18,934
It's okay, it's okay,
we'll take care of him.

671
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:20,969
It's okay, Jesse.

672
00:35:20,971 --> 00:35:22,771
He's gonna be okay.

673
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:26,642
Barry. We did it.

674
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:28,227
Bring them all in.

675
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:31,613
Copy that. I'm on clean up.

676
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:40,278
What's that? I can't... I can't hear you

677
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,397
through the double-paned soundproof glass.

678
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:46,284
It's... it's kind of hard
to make out what you're saying.

679
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:49,404
So should we tell Sara
and Captain Lance about her?

680
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:51,072
No, I've seen what interacting with

681
00:35:51,074 --> 00:35:53,491
your family's doppelgangers can do.

682
00:35:53,493 --> 00:35:54,909
It's not even Laurel.

683
00:35:54,911 --> 00:35:56,411
No. It's just a poor imitation.

684
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,413
Speaking of, that was a pretty good

685
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,582
Killer Frost you did back there.

686
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:01,883
Guess I was in the right head space

687
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:04,385
to play a cold, vicious killer.

688
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:06,554
How you doing, are you okay?

689
00:36:06,556 --> 00:36:08,056
No.

690
00:36:08,058 --> 00:36:10,258
But I think I'm gonna be.

691
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,676
Being out there with you guys,

692
00:36:11,678 --> 00:36:13,595
fighting meta-humans,

693
00:36:13,597 --> 00:36:15,764
saving people...

694
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:17,265
It's the first time I felt

695
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:19,267
normal in a long time.

696
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:20,518
Come here.

697
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,904
- This is a group hug moment.
- Yeah.

698
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:24,072
It is.

699
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:32,614
So all of Zoom's meta-humans

700
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:33,998
are locked up in Iron Heights?

701
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,284
Most of them. Some are somewhere else.

702
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:37,285
I don't want to know.

703
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:38,453
No you don't.

704
00:36:38,455 --> 00:36:39,537
And Zoom?

705
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:42,507
The metas we spoke to said Zoom

706
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:44,008
created a breach and escaped.

707
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,543
And how did he do that again?

708
00:36:45,545 --> 00:36:47,045
Who knows, but he's back on Earth-2 now.

709
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:48,680
Earth-2?

710
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:50,965
That something else
I don't want to know about?

711
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,133
- No.
- No.

712
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:55,270
All right. Well, Flash, thanks.

713
00:36:55,272 --> 00:36:57,305
The man who saved Central City once again.

714
00:36:57,307 --> 00:36:59,691
No, we're all just part of the same team.

715
00:36:59,693 --> 00:37:02,977
Speaking of teams, where the hell is Allen?

716
00:37:04,815 --> 00:37:06,447
Ooh... Sorry, man, sorry... hey.

717
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:08,650
Heard my name. Uh, what's up?

718
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:10,952
Good, well, you've got
about 100 meta criminal cases

719
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,737
to get through, so I would get
to cracking if I were you.

720
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,824
I will get right on that.

721
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:17,625
Captain.

722
00:37:18,662 --> 00:37:20,829
- Well done.
- Thanks.

723
00:37:22,662 --> 00:37:23,995
Listen, uh,

724
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:26,080
I've been thinking about Wally some more.

725
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:28,216
Are you gonna talk to him again?

726
00:37:28,218 --> 00:37:29,133
No, I'm not.

727
00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:30,301
Why not?

728
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:31,886
Because he's your son, Joe.

729
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:33,554
I know he's my son.

730
00:37:33,556 --> 00:37:35,089
I... look... what I mean is

731
00:37:35,091 --> 00:37:37,141
he's got your values.

732
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:40,261
He's got your inner drive
to help people do what's right.

733
00:37:40,263 --> 00:37:42,397
We're supposed to think
we're something we're not

734
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:44,015
until we become that thing.

735
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:46,517
That's the path that Wally's on.

736
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,903
I'm not gonna stop him from being the hero

737
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:51,572
that he's gonna become.

738
00:37:51,574 --> 00:37:53,441
I really don't think you should either.

739
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:57,779
I can't wait till you have
kids and they torture you.

740
00:37:57,781 --> 00:37:59,080
I'ma laugh in your face.

741
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,083
All right, gramps.

742
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:03,251
Poppa.

743
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:04,535
What?

744
00:38:04,537 --> 00:38:07,839
My grandkids are gonna call me "poppa".

745
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:10,124
All right.

746
00:38:18,218 --> 00:38:22,270
What in the world?

747
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:23,388
What is this?

748
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,189
- Blame Iris.
- Okay.

749
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:27,725
I just figured that since Henry
is officially back for good,

750
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:29,310
we should celebrate.

751
00:38:29,312 --> 00:38:32,196
And since Zoom is gone
and the city is quiet right now.

752
00:38:32,198 --> 00:38:34,816
Oh, I appreciate it, Iris.

753
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:36,734
Thank you.

754
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:39,153
- Hi, Tina.
- Hello, Henry.

755
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:40,989
- Jesse.
- Hi.

756
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:43,992
Good to see you.

757
00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:45,910
Good to see you too.

758
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:48,079
- You look... great.
- Thank you.

759
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:51,833
I hope you don't mind
that I invited Dr. McGee.

760
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:54,135
Seems like somebody's glad you did.

761
00:38:54,137 --> 00:38:55,636
Mm-hmm.

762
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,340
So I guess you are invincible.

763
00:38:59,342 --> 00:39:00,758
Told you.

764
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,427
The Speed Force is with us.

765
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:06,931
Since I'm

766
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:10,852
feeling extra invincible lately,

767
00:39:10,854 --> 00:39:12,520
what do you say

768
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:15,823
you and I

769
00:39:15,825 --> 00:39:19,077
give this a shot?

770
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,528
Yeah, I would like that.

771
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:27,535
So is it true?

772
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:30,038
You saved The Flash's life?

773
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,506
Oh, I mean, I was

774
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:33,624
just in the right place at the right time.

775
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:35,460
Proud of you, Wally.

776
00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:37,762
You did good.

777
00:39:37,764 --> 00:39:39,297
Thanks, dad.

778
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:41,599
What?

779
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:43,518
I'm just... I'm proud of you too.

780
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,636
- Soup's on.
- Hey!

781
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:47,138
Taking out a city full of monsters

782
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,190
makes a man hungry.

783
00:39:49,192 --> 00:39:51,726
First,

784
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,728
a toast.

785
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,979
To family.

786
00:39:54,981 --> 00:39:56,814
To family.

787
00:39:56,816 --> 00:39:58,366
That's my kind of toast, short and sweet.

788
00:39:58,368 --> 00:40:00,868
Let's eat.

789
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:07,492
Oh. You guys.

790
00:40:07,494 --> 00:40:08,743
Great.

791
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:13,748
Earth-2.

792
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:25,676
Cisco?

793
00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:28,429
What... What is it?

794
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:29,730
What'd you see?

795
00:40:29,732 --> 00:40:31,766
What do you mean "see"?

796
00:40:31,768 --> 00:40:33,184
Cisco gets visions.

797
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:34,268
I don't understand.

798
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,270
What Cisco?

799
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:39,107
Earth-2 splitting in half.

800
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:41,109
Straight down to the poles.

801
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:42,944
Tell me I didn't just vibe the future.

802
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:44,412
Please tell me I did not

803
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:46,948
just see the end of the world!

804
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,542
Our story continues,

805
00:40:57,544 --> 00:40:59,961
Flash.

806
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:05,766
- Henry!
- Oh, my God.

807
00:41:13,643 --> 00:41:15,526
Dad?

808
00:41:15,528 --> 00:41:16,978
Dad?

809
00:41:20,233 --> 00:41:22,984
It's poetic, returning
to your childhood home.

810
00:41:24,204 --> 00:41:25,987
Jay.

811
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:28,156
Don't do this.

812
00:41:28,158 --> 00:41:29,490
I'm begging you.

813
00:41:29,492 --> 00:41:31,125
I'm begging you! Take me.

814
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:32,994
- Kill me!
- No!

815
00:41:32,996 --> 00:41:34,996
You still won't believe me
that you and I are the same.

816
00:41:34,998 --> 00:41:37,715
- Come on.
- Barry, look at me, son.

817
00:41:37,717 --> 00:41:40,635
So I'm gonna have to make you believe me.

818
00:41:40,637 --> 00:41:42,970
Whatever happens you have made me

819
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:45,556
- the happiest father...
- Dad...

820
00:41:45,558 --> 00:41:47,475
This time, you're gonna
watch your parent die

821
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:48,676
just like I did.

822
00:41:48,678 --> 00:41:50,144
- No, no!
- And this

823
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:51,062
is what's gonna make you

824
00:41:51,064 --> 00:41:52,813
just like me!

825
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:54,015
Your mother and I love...

826
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:55,066
Jay!

827
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:56,216
No!

828
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:03,367
