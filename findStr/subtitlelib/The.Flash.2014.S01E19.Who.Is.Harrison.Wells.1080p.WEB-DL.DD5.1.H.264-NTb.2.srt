1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:05,938
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,873
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:08,875
By something impossible.

4
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,075
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:12,945
My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:16,882
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:19,585
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,621
But secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,189
And find others like me.

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,859
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:27,893
Mom!

12
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,294
And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,830
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,432
Previously on The Flash...

15
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:34,833
If you love me,

16
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,502
You'll tell me
what is going on with you.

17
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,338
Keeping her in the dark
keeps her safe.

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,606
I don't agree.

19
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,875
Harrison Wells is
the Reverse-Flash.

20
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,611
15 years ago, Harrison and I
were thick as thieves.

21
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:47,346
We were promising
young scientists,

22
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:49,515
And then everything changed
after Tess died.

23
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,652
- Who are you?
- My name is Eobard Thawne.

24
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:57,022
In the year 2020,
you and your wife

25
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,858
Successfully launched
a particle accelerator

26
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,326
That changed the course
of history.

27
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,728
I need it to happen
a bit sooner

28
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,029
If I'm going to get back.

29
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,364
After that day,

30
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,967
Harrison Wells became
a completely different person.

31
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,606
I'm getting faster,
faster than I've ever been,

32
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,876
And I wonder if it's because
lately something's chasing me.

33
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,679
I know what it is
that's stalking me.

34
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,548
It's my past.

35
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,383
It's getting closer,
and as fast as I am,

36
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,452
I can't help but feel like
my past

37
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:29,788
Has almost caught up
with me.

38
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,557
- Where's Barry?
- He should be here any second.

39
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,425
I sent him out for...

40
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,460
Pizza!

41
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:36,862
- What?
- From coast city?

42
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:39,398
Supposedly the best
in the west.

43
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,300
Why did I not
think of this before?

44
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,901
Come to papa.

45
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,036
Caitlin?

46
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:45,804
I'm not hungry.

47
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,941
Okay, six months
of investigating Harrison Wells

48
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,043
Has led us nowhere,
so we're going back

49
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:53,545
To the beginning to see
what we can find out.

50
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:54,580
What does that mean?

51
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,914
Road trip, baby.

52
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,816
Joe and Cisco are going
to go to starling city.

53
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:58,917
Starling city?
What for?

54
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,652
To investigate
the car accident

55
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,988
That Dr. Wells was in
with Tess Morgan 15 years ago.

56
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,623
I-I don't understand.
Why?

57
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,992
Dr. Mcgee said that
after wells's accident,

58
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,428
He became like
a complete stranger.

59
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,063
Just a different person
entirely.

60
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,499
Because the love
of his life died?

61
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,701
You of all people
can understand how grief

62
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,969
Can change a person.

63
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,338
Caitlin, we believe
that Dr. Wells

64
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,673
Is the Reverse-Flash
and killed Barry's mother,

65
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,675
And he may have done
the same thing to Tess Morgan.

66
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:27,179
We have to learn everything
we can about that night.

67
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:28,280
See where it leads us.

68
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,382
Oh, um, can you
cover for me

69
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:32,151
With Dr. Wells?

70
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:35,120
You mean lie?

71
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,189
Yeah.

72
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,390
I need some air.

73
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,925
Whoa... hey, Caitlin...

74
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,164
Doesn't look like
Caitlin's with us.

75
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,633
No, she's with us.
I'll talk to her.

76
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,967
What do you
want us to do here?

77
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,236
Business as usual
while we're gone.

78
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:53,805
Copy that.

79
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:57,142
Well, I want to wish you
good luck over there,

80
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,111
But I'm also scared
of what you might find.

81
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,612
Scared is a good thing.

82
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,981
Scared keeps us alive.

83
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,119
Can you get the door, Nina?

84
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,288
- Nina?
- Oh.

85
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,023
Sorry.

86
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,959
Wrapped up
in my own little world.

87
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,327
Late night?

88
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:20,699
Just one more thing to do
before I make my escape.

89
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,902
- See you tomorrow.
- Night.

90
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:48,126
So let's go over this again.

91
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:52,097
This is you on the
surveillance footage, correct?

92
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,666
It looks like me.

93
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:58,570
But it's not me.

94
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,505
I left work
early yesterday.

95
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:02,841
Ask my husband.

96
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,544
Footage doesn't lie.
Your husband might.

97
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:07,346
That's not me.

98
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,984
No priors, no arrests,
not even a speeding ticket.

99
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,318
And everyone who knows
this woman,

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,686
Coworkers, neighbors,

101
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,622
Say she's the kindest,
nicest,

102
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,690
Most honest woman
they've ever met.

103
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:21,093
So, unless she woke up
this morning

104
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,528
And out of nowhere
decided to become a criminal...

105
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,997
Maybe we should be
looking for a meta-human.

106
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:25,999
Yeah.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,799
One that can control
people's minds.

108
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,768
Coerce them into
becoming thieves.

109
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,336
Is that possible?

110
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,571
Is that a real question?

111
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:33,573
Hi, Barry.

112
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,240
Hey.

113
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,209
Have you, um, seen my dad?

114
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,810
Captain singh says he took a
couple of days off,

115
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,545
And he hasn't been home.

116
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:41,947
I didn't ask.

117
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,616
Apparently he's taking
a couple of personal days.

118
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,686
Like father, like daughter
I guess.

119
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,191
I'm sorry.

120
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,760
When are you coming home?

121
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,963
When it starts to feel
like a home again.

122
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,001
You better pray Joe and Cisco
find something on Wells

123
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,503
At that accident site, Barry,

124
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:08,340
Because I am just about done
lying to Iris.

125
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:11,043
About all of this.

126
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,744
Yeah.

127
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:22,054
I recently inherited
the entire collection.

128
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,556
Beautiful.

129
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:25,624
Let me grab
my microscope.

130
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,827
Of course.

131
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,135
9-1-1.
Emergency.

132
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,204
This is Dominic over at
Abbott Jewelers.

133
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:42,274
I've got a guy in here
trying to sell stolen diamonds.

134
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,077
- Good morning.
- Hey.

135
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,613
Hey, look, uh...
Can we talk about last night?

136
00:05:48,615 --> 00:05:49,948
There's nothing
to talk about.

137
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,983
Yeah, there is actually.
Caitlin, look,

138
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,486
I know after everything
Dr. Wells has done

139
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,922
For all of us, it's hard to wrap
your head around this,

140
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,690
But I need you
to see the truth.

141
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,225
The truth?

142
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:03,328
The truth is that he saved
your life multiple times.

143
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,497
Look, I know.
But if I'm right about this...

144
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,698
If, Barry, if.

145
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,166
And before I can believe
any of this,

146
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:10,102
I'm gonna need to
see some proof.

147
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:11,503
Proof?

148
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,705
Proof of what?

149
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:17,976
W... we may have another
meta-human case on our hands.

150
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,313
Ah. We are always happy
to help, Barry, as you know.

151
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:23,615
Have you heard from Cisco?
He hasn't arrived yet.

152
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,585
Uh, he has to help Dante,
his brother.

153
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,787
He might need
a few days off.

154
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:29,888
Ah, well.

155
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,291
All right.

156
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,593
Eddie.

157
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:35,761
Hey, I got a call
about a guy

158
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:36,962
Selling some of the jewelry

159
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,130
Stolen from the bank
last night.

160
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:40,332
Could be the Teller's partner.

161
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,969
I think he's made me.

162
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,437
I could use
the Flash's help.

163
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,439
Be right there.

164
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,229
Oh!

165
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,771
You can't outrun me.

166
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,973
I won't have to.

167
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,056
Well, that was new.

168
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,300
A shape-shifter?

169
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,702
Yeah, I literally saw
a grown man, like,

170
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,572
M... morph into
a teenage girl.

171
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:54,973
That's fascinating.

172
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,142
Today's physicists have
always regarded

173
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,644
Programmable matter
as nothing more than a theory,

174
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:02,714
But I guess your shape-shifter
proves it can be done.

175
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,417
Wait, so he, or she,
or I... whatever.

176
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,520
This person
can actually transform

177
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,654
Into anyone they touch?

178
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,723
Yes, it appears so.

179
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,325
That includes you,
Mr. Allen.

180
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,360
Dr. Wells is right.
If you are touched while

181
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,696
You're the Flash,
and he transforms into you,

182
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,297
We run the risk of him exposing

183
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,333
That Barry Allen
is the man behind the mask.

184
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,868
Because at this point
we don't know

185
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,903
If the shape-shifter
is capable of absorbing more

186
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,505
That just
your physical characteristics.

187
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:28,373
Like he might be able
to copy my speed?

188
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,407
That would be bad.

189
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,710
Got it.
Hands off the meta-human.

190
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,178
Hands off the meta-human.

191
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,014
So how do we find someone
who can transform into anyone?

192
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,449
Well, I guess
like any problem,

193
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,150
You just go back
to the beginning.

194
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,086
In this case, that would mean
finding the first person

195
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,320
The shape-shifter
morphed into

196
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,755
When they discovered
their powers.

197
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,457
Yeah, can you pull up
the CCPD records

198
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,359
Of cases where the perpetrator
plead innocent,

199
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,227
Even thought they were caught
on camera committing the crime?

200
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,996
You're good, Barry Allen.

201
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,564
You're very good.

202
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:57,636
Look at this.
Multiple crimes of this manner

203
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:58,970
All dating back to a month

204
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,573
After the particle accelerator
explosion.

205
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:05,610
And the first one was?

206
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:08,647
Jacob Fisher. A teller at the
federal credit union.

207
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,383
Claims he was innocent, and was
framed by his best friend,

208
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,218
A hannibal bates.

209
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,819
I'll pass this along
to the CCPD,

210
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:15,921
See if they can
track him down.

211
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,723
- Good.
- Thank you, Dr. Wells.

212
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,425
Always here to help, Barry.

213
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:36,174
There it is.

214
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,642
This is all you have?

215
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,411
Well, it's a pretty
cut and dry case, detective.

216
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,880
Harrison Wells, Tess Morgan
are out on a Sunday drive,

217
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:44,282
The tires blow,
Wells loses control,

218
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,685
And, uh... Sadly Tess dies
on the scene.

219
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:49,254
Couldn't imagine carrying
that kind of guilt around.

220
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,391
So, uh... What are you two
hoping to find?

221
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,226
We're not exactly
sure yet.

222
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,695
You come all the way
from central city,

223
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,896
You don't know what
you're looking for?

224
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,264
Just following a hunch.

225
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,132
Uh, can you take us
to the accident site?

226
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,901
It's been 15 years.
I think the pictures will

227
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,035
Serve you better.

228
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,771
Still, we'd appreciate
a look.

229
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,407
Whatever you need.

230
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,810
Captain, I need those
witness statements

231
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,111
For the Joshua Brown trial.

232
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:18,350
Um, yeah, well,
like I told you, end of day.

233
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,719
Sorry, uh, Detective West,
Cisco Ramon,

234
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,988
This is A.D.A.
Laurel Lance.

235
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:23,990
Related?

236
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,191
Daughter.

237
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,892
Hi.
Hi.

238
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:29,327
Hey there.

239
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,730
You work at S.T.A.R. Labs
with Barry Allen, right?

240
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,198
Uh, yeah.

241
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,334
Can I talk to you privately
for a minute?

242
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,969
Sure.

243
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,975
So, uh... How is Allen?

244
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,012
Not too messed up from getting
hit by that lightning, I hope.

245
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,014
No, no.

246
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,382
How do you know Barry?

247
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:51,950
Are you guys, like,
friends or something?

248
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,151
Not really.

249
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,186
We met last time
he was in starling city

250
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,688
Visiting my friends.

251
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,392
John Diggle, Felicity Smoak,
and Oliver Queen.

252
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,962
Three people who have
absolutely nothing in common.

253
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,230
As far as I know.

254
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:07,699
Cisco, I know Barry's
The Flash,

255
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,800
And Oliver's the Arrow.

256
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,305
How do you know that?

257
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:18,043
Because I'm the Black Canary.

258
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,544
- Stop playing.
- It's true.

259
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,212
You stop it right now.

260
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,182
No.

261
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,052
Okay, okay.
Calm down.

262
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:31,056
I love you.

263
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:35,694
I mean, I love the way
that you beat up criminals.

264
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,330
Wait.

265
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,534
Why are you telling me this?

266
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,603
Because I need some
technical expertise.

267
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,672
I've been using
my sister's sonic device.

268
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:54,279
I was hoping you could
help... Modify it.

269
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:58,683
Yeah.
I think I've got some ideas.

270
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,453
Great.

271
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,172
What... are you
spying on me now?

272
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:29,440
Caitlin, what were you doing
at Wells's house?

273
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,410
I was gonna talk to him
and get some answers of my own.

274
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,313
You can't.
You cannot talk to him.

275
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,881
Oh, so I'm just supposed
to stand by

276
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,884
And watch all of you ruin
this man's life?

277
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,587
Ruin my life?

278
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,823
What are you talking about
"your life?"

279
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:49,327
Those nine months
that you were in a coma

280
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,629
Were the worst of my life.

281
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,966
I lost my reputation,
my fiance,

282
00:13:54,968 --> 00:14:00,505
And through all of that,
Harrison Wells stood by my side.

283
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,608
He told me everything
was going to be okay.

284
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:07,111
If Dr. Wells is
who you say he is,

285
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,214
Everything I've done
since the minute

286
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,150
I stepped foot
in S.T.A.R. Labs

287
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,886
Has been a lie.

288
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,189
Caitlin.

289
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,759
If I am right
about all of this,

290
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,730
And you tell him
what's been going on,

291
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:30,068
I'll never be able to get
my dad out of prison.

292
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,569
Barry.

293
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:34,772
If not for me,
just do it for him.

294
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:38,476
I can't believe
you're pulling the dad card.

295
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,345
That's dirty pool, Barry.

296
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,047
Just until Joe and Cisco
get back.

297
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,250
Please.

298
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,370
Turns out hannibal bates hasn't
been seen in well over a year.

299
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,772
Only remaining relative
is his grandmother.

300
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:09,807
She took out
a missing person's report

301
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,677
A couple of days after
the Jacob Fisher arrest.

302
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,679
Figure we could ask her
a few questions.

303
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,247
Like why anyone
in their family

304
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,749
Thought that naming a kid
hannibal

305
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,717
Wouldn't mean he'd grow up
to become a criminal?

306
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,422
Have you heard from your
grandson, hannibal, recently,

307
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,456
Mrs. Bates?

308
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,891
- Recently?
- Uh-huh.

309
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,360
No.
Why do you ask?

310
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,229
Oh, please.

311
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,765
Um...

312
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:37,368
Because you filed
a missing person's report

313
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,870
Over a year ago.

314
00:15:38,872 --> 00:15:41,572
Oh, yes, I certainly did.

315
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:44,609
You'll have to
forgive me, detective.

316
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,712
My memory is not quite
as it used to be.

317
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,013
Of course.

318
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:52,483
Uh, neither apparently
are my manners.

319
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,086
May I get you two something?

320
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,454
Coffee, tea?

321
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,222
Uh, no thank you, ma'am.
We're fine.

322
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:00,458
Oh, please.

323
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,793
It'll only take
a minute.

324
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,996
It's nice to have visitors.

325
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,300
Coffee'd be nice.

326
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,835
Thanks.

327
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:22,814
Ma'am, would you happen
to have a recent photograph

328
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:23,881
Of hannibal?

329
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,586
Ma'am?

330
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,560
She's gone.

331
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:38,196
I'll take the front.

332
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,504
Hey, we located bates.

333
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,872
He was impersonating
his grandma.

334
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:49,407
Barry, do not let him
touch you.

335
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,509
Or let him see you
use your super speed.

336
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,877
Well, how am I supposed
to catch him?

337
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,078
The old-fashioned way.

338
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,180
Run like a normal person.

339
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,183
Okay, all right.

340
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,351
Oh, man.

341
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,296
What do you want
us to do, Thawne?

342
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,031
Die.

343
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,282
Barry, call 911.

344
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
What do you want us to do,
Thawne?

345
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,762
Die.

346
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,363
I know what this
looks like, Cecile.

347
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:21,032
It looks like
one of your detectives

348
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,433
Shot two of your cops,

349
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,968
Both of whom are now
fighting for their lives.

350
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,336
That's not
what happened.

351
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,804
David, I am
the district attorney.

352
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,139
I can't ignore
what I just watched

353
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,440
Because you want me to.

354
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,741
We both know
there are things going on

355
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,543
In this city
that can't be explained.

356
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,846
Come on, David.
Until you show me something

357
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,248
Incontrovertible,
the best that I can do

358
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,019
Is promise to keep him out of
gen pop at iron heights.

359
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,163
Do you have any way
to explain this, Allen?

360
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,265
I'm working on it.

361
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,769
- Barry.
- Iris.

362
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,505
What is going on?
Everyone at CCPN is saying

363
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:01,507
That Eddie shot two cops.

364
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,440
How is that even possible?

365
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,774
We're not sure yet.

366
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,109
You don't think he did this,
do you?

367
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,878
- No, of course not.
- I need to see him.

368
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,646
You can't...
You can't see him, all right?

369
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,548
They're not gonna let you.
Look...

370
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,583
I'm gonna do everything
I can to help him.

371
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,719
- Okay.
- Okay?

372
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:15,953
Okay, I'm so sorry.

373
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:18,789
It's gonna be okay.

374
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,525
- Okay.
- I promise.

375
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:22,860
All right?

376
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,601
This is definitely the place.

377
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,938
Cisco, let's see
what we can find.

378
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,174
What is that?
A, uh, metal detector?

379
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,608
Uh, essentially.

380
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,277
Only instead of listening
for metal objects,

381
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,478
I'm listening for anything

382
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,246
That emits
a abnormal sound wave.

383
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,648
Right.

384
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,383
Where'd you find this kid?

385
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:46,851
It's a long story.

386
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,486
So, it must be interesting
having a daughter

387
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,887
Who is also the D.A.

388
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,923
Yeah, interesting's the word.

389
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:53,724
- I have a daughter of my own.
- Same line of work?

390
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:55,793
No, I wouldn't let her
anywhere near this nonsense.

391
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,195
Smart guy.

392
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,462
Overprotective.

393
00:19:58,464 --> 00:19:59,931
You two get along?

394
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,332
We don't always see
eye to eye,

395
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,834
But no matter how mad
she gets at me

396
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,169
Or how mad
I get at her,

397
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,071
There's a strong bond.

398
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,105
Why?

399
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,674
You two have a bit
of a rough patch?

400
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,475
Yeah, she, uh...

401
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:12,577
She kept something from me,

402
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,778
You know,
something important.

403
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,614
Lied to me about it
for months.

404
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,216
Hard to come back
from something like that.

405
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,318
Mm.
She give a reason?

406
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,953
Not one I could accept.

407
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,556
Ah. Well,
sometimes we lie for love.

408
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,198
Especially when it comes
to family, right?

409
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,294
- Joe!
- Yeah?

410
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:32,096
I think we got something.

411
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,432
Tachyons.
Little bits of time travel.

412
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:35,967
You sure?

413
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,304
Pretty sure, yeah.

414
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,941
I didn't shoot those officers.

415
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,510
Yeah, the captain certainly
plead your case.

416
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,179
The results of
the GSR Swab.

417
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:50,014
Detective Thawne's hands
are completely free

418
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,582
Of lead, barium, and antimony.

419
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,984
Yet no one can seem
to explain

420
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,319
How the surveillance video
clearly shows

421
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,621
Thawne firing his weapon.

422
00:20:56,623 --> 00:20:58,522
It only looked like
Detective Thawne.

423
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,991
Mr. Allen, no.

424
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:02,727
Aren't you supposed to be
the scientist around here?

425
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,199
It's hard to blame her.
That video is pretty damning.

426
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,835
No. No, we just have to
convince her.

427
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,004
Seeing is believing, barry.

428
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,972
They're gonna put me away.

429
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,781
Okay, look,
you get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

430
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:24,849
They'll set you up
with a burner phone.

431
00:21:24,851 --> 00:21:26,117
- I'll contact...
- No.

432
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,618
I run now,
that surveillance video

433
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,853
Is the least
of my problems.

434
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,254
No way I don't
smell guilty.

435
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,555
No way they'll let me
stay on the force.

436
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:32,790
Look, you said it
yourself,

437
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,091
If we don't find
hannibal bates,

438
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:35,026
You go to prison.

439
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:36,294
For a crime
you didn't commit.

440
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,896
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Not again.

441
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,730
This isn't like your dad,
Barry.

442
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:40,732
Eddie, look.

443
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,366
When you dad
was put away,

444
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,567
You were a kid.

445
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,969
There wasn't anything
you could do.

446
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,270
But you're not
a kid anymore.

447
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,571
You're a scientist.

448
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:51,242
Hell, you're The Flash.

449
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:52,677
You are going to find bates,

450
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,612
And you are going
to clear me.

451
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,547
So go do it.

452
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,684
All right.

453
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,791
Get me out of here
the right way.

454
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,225
I promise, Iris.

455
00:22:08,227 --> 00:22:09,960
Now, I'm just here
to shower and change,

456
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:11,429
And then I'm going
right back to my lab.

457
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,631
I swear I'm going to get
Eddie out of this, okay?

458
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,268
I'll call you later, all right?

459
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,007
Eddie? What in the world?
How did you get out?

460
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,109
Captain Singh called in
a favor.

461
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,610
Got a judge
to sign my release.

462
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,045
I was just on the phone
with Iris.

463
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,181
Why haven't you called her?
Hold on.

464
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:34,085
I have no idea who she is.

465
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,386
Barry, it's me.

466
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:11,155
Hello... You.

467
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,657
I think I figured out
a way to stop our shapeshifter

468
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,092
From morphing into
other people.

469
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:15,893
Oh, really?

470
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,361
What if I create
a serum

471
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:19,697
That will terminate
the polymerization reaction,

472
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:23,167
Essentially forcing the bonds
to revert to their original form

473
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,403
Stopping him from being able
to control his power.

474
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,937
You can do that?

475
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:30,708
- Yeah, I think so.
- Okay.

476
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,510
What's wrong with you?

477
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:33,978
Nothing.

478
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,880
Look, about last night,

479
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:38,582
I can't imagine
how hard this must be for you.

480
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,184
I mean, I know how desperate
you are

481
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,919
To solve your mom's murder.

482
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,055
But let's just
bury the hatchet,

483
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,758
And we'll go back
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

484
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,594
Figure out how to catch
this Everyman.

485
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,496
"Everyman?"

486
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:53,731
Bad nickname?

487
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:54,932
No.

488
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:57,535
No, I kinda like it.

489
00:23:57,537 --> 00:23:59,136
Okay, good.
Me, too.

490
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:10,981
Wait, hold up, Cisco.

491
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,751
Please tell me that's not
what I think it is.

492
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,986
Okay, that is definitely
a hand.

493
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,655
Okay, see, I thought
it was a foot,

494
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,857
But a hand is just as bad.

495
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,297
That is freaky.

496
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,299
That is proof, Cisco.

497
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,600
I'll need to test it
to be certain.

498
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,968
I'm gonna
grab my kit.

499
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,069
Okay, I'm gonna have to
call this one in.

500
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,371
I can't let you
do that.

501
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:37,508
Now I'm asking you,
cop to cop,

502
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,576
Keep this under wraps.

503
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:39,844
Forget you ever saw it.

504
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,812
- West, I can't do that.
- Listen, Lance,

505
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,581
If this is who
I think it is,

506
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,915
Anybody that knows
about this

507
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:45,983
Is in a hell of a lot
of danger,

508
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,885
Including my daughter.

509
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,253
As mad as you are
at Laurel,

510
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,988
I can't imagine
you wouldn't do anything

511
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,090
To protect her.

512
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,235
Hey.
Good to go.

513
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:06,637
Just need to give it
a little spin.

514
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:08,839
Oh.

515
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,577
Right.
Yes.

516
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:15,579
A spin.

517
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,184
So this, uh...

518
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,685
Serum that you're making,

519
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,320
Is it a temporary fix,

520
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:26,323
Or will it take away
his power permanently?

521
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,325
Not permanently.

522
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:31,829
Just long enough
so we can stop him.

523
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:35,299
And how long is it
going to take?

524
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,903
Not long.

525
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:42,606
We just need...

526
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:44,608
What are you doing?

527
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:57,922
Something I think
I should have done...

528
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:01,592
A long time ago.

529
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,131
Mm.

530
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,668
Barry, uh...

531
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,009
Oh, my god.

532
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,544
Look who's here.

533
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:23,047
Yes.
Her.

534
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:29,753
Hi, I have been looking
for you everywhere.

535
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,990
Here I am.
What's up?

536
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,225
Look, whoever is framing Eddie,
I got to thinking.

537
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:37,027
What if they've done
something like this before?

538
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,029
I went through CCPN's
crime archives,

539
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,332
And in the last 11 months,
there have been six crimes

540
00:26:41,334 --> 00:26:42,833
Committed by people
who later swore

541
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:43,901
That they were innocent.

542
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,235
None of them
had priors,

543
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,237
All of them had
rock-solid alibis.

544
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,407
- All right.
- So...

545
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,743
I hacked into my dad's
CCPD account,

546
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,746
And went through the footage
of Eddie shooting those cops.

547
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:56,914
Look.

548
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:57,915
What do you want us to do,
Thawne?

549
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:01,118
Die

550
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:06,924
What's wrong with you?

551
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,726
Huh?
Nothing.

552
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:11,629
I didn't do anything.

553
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:15,232
I don't know.
Seems pretty convincing to me.

554
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,968
Look again.

555
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,436
Eddie is not left-handed.

556
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,772
Look, Eddie is being framed,
and we need to figure out

557
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,440
Who is behind this.

558
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,643
And believe me,
when I get my hands on them,

559
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:26,645
They are going to be...

560
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,949
Oh, my god.
What did you do?

561
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:35,285
Your observations about the
shooter were spot on, Miss West.

562
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:37,521
He was indeed left-handed.

563
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,956
As is this man.

564
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:42,559
Our Barry...
Is right-handed.

565
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,396
Oh, I knew it.

566
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:47,931
- Never mind.
- Then this is him.

567
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,166
It is indeed.

568
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,968
I need to take him in
to the police.

569
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,102
If they can see what he can do,

570
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,604
Then maybe they'll let Eddie go.

571
00:27:53,606 --> 00:27:56,340
Perhaps it might be best
if Dr. Snow and I handle this.

572
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:57,141
Mm.

573
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,676
What are you two
going to do?

574
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,448
No. No, no, no.
I'm taking him in.

575
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,117
Of course.

576
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,353
Well, at least let me help you.

577
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:17,394
There is a reporter at work
who kept a file

578
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,763
Of these
sorts of things.

579
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:23,634
You know, all of the unexplained
events in the city.

580
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:26,403
This guy...

581
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:28,639
Definitely belongs
in that file.

582
00:28:28,641 --> 00:28:31,108
That's gonna be
a pretty big file.

583
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:40,617
You know who else
is in that file?

584
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,252
The burning man.

585
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:43,587
Oh, really?
What about him?

586
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,257
I thought he was just some
urban legend.

587
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:50,060
Help me!
Help me, help me, help me!

588
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,563
- Oh, no.
- Someone, please, help me!

589
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:55,432
Help! Help! These bad ladies
have kidnapped me!

590
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,301
- What's going on here?
- I need help!

591
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:59,870
I need help!
These bad ladies kidnapped me!

592
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:00,872
We did not kidnap her.

593
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,072
- No.
- Iris, drive.

594
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,474
- I can't.
- Call the police.

595
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:07,644
No. No, no, no.
She's dangerous.

596
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,445
Hey!

597
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:09,447
She's dangerous.
No!

598
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,648
Hey!
Where are you going?

599
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,673
Oh, Barry.

600
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,080
Aah!

601
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,114
For real?

602
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,382
Why did you slap me?

603
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,950
Because you were unconscious.

604
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,086
Smelling salts
work just as well.

605
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,754
Sorry.
You okay?

606
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,222
I think so, yeah.

607
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:54,057
Wait, Caitlin.
Bates, he was here.

608
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,626
Uh, yes, I know.

609
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,928
Okay, let's go.

610
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,130
You sure there's nothing else
I can do for you, detective?

611
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,532
You have done
more than enough.

612
00:30:01,534 --> 00:30:03,367
Thank you for everything,
Captain.

613
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,469
Listen, I should be
thanking you

614
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,703
For getting me
out of the office for a day.

615
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,405
Pushing papers,
reviewing budgets

616
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,073
Public all over my ass.
It's been a nice change.

617
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,476
I'd still be detective
if I could, but, you know,

618
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:14,711
Body just can't
take it anymore.

619
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,281
What you gonna do
when you got a bad heart?

620
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:22,152
I can think of something
that might make things better.

621
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:35,199
Cisco.

622
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,867
Laurel, hey.
Uh...

623
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,136
We're just about
to head back to Central City.

624
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:41,839
Were you able to
make that item?

625
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,512
I think this will
do the trick.

626
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,319
I bumped up the specs.

627
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:58,455
Quadrupled the range,
tripled the resonance.

628
00:30:58,457 --> 00:31:00,991
You should be able to do some
serious damage with this thing.

629
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:04,094
I can't believe you were able
to make it so quickly.

630
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:08,699
Eh. I've had some practice
with sound waves recently.

631
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:11,902
I think you should call it
"The Canary Cry."

632
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:16,073
I like it.
Thank you.

633
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,275
As promised.

634
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:23,380
Hey, you show this to anyone,
I'll kill you.

635
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,682
That's just an expression,

636
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:26,783
Right?

637
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,051
Nope.

638
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,269
Cisco?
You good?

639
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,803
Oh, I'm good.

640
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,140
So this hannibal bates
has turned into

641
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,342
Quite the meta-human.
Take a look.

642
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,779
His cells have the ability
to transmogrify

643
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:56,781
At quite the rate.

644
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,382
Which is how
he can become anyone.

645
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:00,017
Which is how he can
look like anyone.

646
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:02,686
Because he cannot appropriate
your memory or your powers.

647
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,922
Got it.
Hands on the meta-human.

648
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,890
Hands on the meta-human.
And to help you do that,

649
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:08,992
Dr. Snow has concocted
a solution we believe

650
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,327
Will stop him.

651
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,962
Yes. I've made a serum
that will create

652
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:14,298
A cortical reaction
around his cells.

653
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,633
Deprive those cells
of their electrical charge,

654
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,269
His shape-shifting days
are over.

655
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,304
Wow, that's great work.

656
00:32:20,306 --> 00:32:21,571
Thank you.

657
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:24,308
Um... No need
for a hug

658
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,045
Or anything like that.

659
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,047
Okay.

660
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,415
Oh, Barry.

661
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:32,816
We got a ping
from your cell phone.

662
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:35,118
Looks like hannibal bates
is at the airport.

663
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Payback time.

664
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,797
Guys, are we sure
he's at the airport?

665
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,967
According to the GPS
on your phone, he's there.

666
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,401
Yeah, but...

667
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:55,272
He could be any
of these people.

668
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:56,840
I'm not seeing him.

669
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,220
Gotcha.

670
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:19,663
Hannibal Bates.

671
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,632
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

672
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,304
Wait.
It's me.

673
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:30,140
Please don't hurt me.

674
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,263
Not so hero-like.

675
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,399
Treat all your women
like that?

676
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,177
Well, look at that.

677
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:11,048
I'm The Flash.

678
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:21,558
You may look like me...

679
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,395
But you're not as fast.

680
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,969
You're done imitating
innocent people.

681
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:51,888
Aah!

682
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,126
- Barry?
- Yeah.

683
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,527
The one and only.

684
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,736
Detective Thawne
has been released.

685
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:09,406
I have to admit
this is new territory for me.

686
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:12,042
This is new territory
for all of us.

687
00:35:12,044 --> 00:35:13,510
I certainly don't think
the law is prepared

688
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:16,246
To deal with this kind
of criminal.

689
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:20,450
Hopefully we can
catch up fast.

690
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,751
It's hard to believe
we live in a world

691
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,787
Where this kind of impossible
even exists.

692
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,390
Luckily it's also a world
where the Flash exists.

693
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:29,126
Uh, speaking of...

694
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,828
He left this list
of all the robberies

695
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,997
That Hannibal Bates
was involved in.

696
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,031
That's a long list.

697
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:36,633
With just as many
innocent people

698
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:40,370
Whose names
need to be cleared.

699
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,738
You know,
I saw the Flash once.

700
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,273
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

701
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,307
I was on my way
to the courthouse.

702
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,909
He blew past me.
It was...

703
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:49,813
It was just a blur of red
and a gust of wind.

704
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:52,015
But it was
pretty damn cool.

705
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,190
Iris.

706
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:02,959
Oh.

707
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:04,561
All charges
have been dropped.

708
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:05,695
I'm clear to go.

709
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:08,231
Oh, thank god.

710
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:11,801
Iris...

711
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,336
I need to tell you something.

712
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,740
You know what?
It can wait until we get home.

713
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,076
You were right.

714
00:36:20,078 --> 00:36:21,611
I was hiding something
from you,

715
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,513
And you deserve to
know the truth.

716
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,850
The reason I've been
so distant lately...

717
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,056
I've been working
with the Flash.

718
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:45,969
Let me out of here!

719
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:49,206
Hey, cutie.
Want to let me out of here?

720
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:53,043
Like anyone would be
dumb enough to fall for that.

721
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,446
Seen a lot of things
that you can become,

722
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,717
But who are you,
Hannibal Bates?

723
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:12,395
I, uh...

724
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:13,930
I can't remember.

725
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,070
I can't remember.

726
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,939
Well, let's lock up shop.
Good night, everyone.

727
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,386
What about dr. Wells?

728
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,388
Come here.

729
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,058
I need to show you
something.

730
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,729
This isn't possible.

731
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,865
Caitlin, I ran
the DNA test twice.

732
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,100
It's a perfect match.

733
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,502
This body is the real
Harrison Wells.

734
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,070
If this is Dr. Wells,

735
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:57,207
Then who have we been
working for this whole time?

736
00:37:57,209 --> 00:37:59,209
Dr. Mcgee said that
after the accident,

737
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:03,280
Wells became
a completely different person.

738
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:06,716
It's because he is
a different person.

739
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:24,768
Dr. Wells.

740
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,904
You here on business?

741
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:30,273
Business, no.
I came to give my regards

742
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,008
To Detective Thawne.

743
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,476
Glad it all worked out.

744
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,979
Yeah.
Crazy day for him.

745
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,280
Yeah.

746
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:40,650
Crazy day for us all.

747
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,185
Oh.

748
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:46,756
Detective, did you enjoy
your time in Starling City?

749
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,525
Not much time
for sightseeing.

750
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:49,726
I was working on a case.

751
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,329
- Oh.
- You used to live there.

752
00:38:52,331 --> 00:38:53,863
I did.

753
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,532
You ever go back?

754
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:58,768
No.

755
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,570
Too many memories
of Tess.

756
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,006
That's right.
Sorry.

757
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:06,676
You, detective, are one of
the few people I know

758
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:10,680
That truly understands
that kind of loss.

759
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:16,820
Iris's mother, you never
talk about her, do you?

760
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:21,124
No.

761
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,126
I don't.

762
00:39:23,128 --> 00:39:26,796
No?

763
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,565
You and I,
detective,

764
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:33,269
Are members of a rather
exclusive club, I suppose.

765
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:39,809
One who's membership
is too expensive.

766
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,379
Maybe we should have
another drink sometime.

767
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:43,646
Talk about it.

768
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,482
Yeah.

769
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:46,683
Yeah, we should
do that.

770
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:17,714
What are you doing?

771
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,115
After the accelerator
exploded,

772
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,750
I built a 3-D model
of S.T.A.R. Labs

773
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,820
So that I could pinpoint exactly
what caused the malfunction.

774
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,855
And you never ran this test?

775
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,757
Of course I did.
I just never had any reason

776
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,894
To look at any areas outside
of the pipeline or the cortex.

777
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,128
It's a big building.
Lots of places

778
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,863
For wells to hide something.

779
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,934
What is that?

780
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:42,238
That shouldn't be there.

781
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,675
I'm picking up more activity
around here.

782
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:49,712
Tachyons.

783
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,483
There.

784
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,343
Oh, my god.

785
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,837
Guys.

786
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,714
What the frak?

787
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,343
Greg, move your head.
