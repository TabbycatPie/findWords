19
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:03,220
My name is Barry Allen,

20
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,260
and I am the fastest man alive.

21
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,050
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

22
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,660
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

23
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,360
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

24
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,700
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,

25
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,120
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

26
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,390
and I saw him murder the woman that I love.

27
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,080
But I won't let that happen.

28
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,180
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future,

29
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,830
and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.

30
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,010
I am The Flash.

31
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,020
Previously on "The Flash"...

32
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,970
Grodd. He's got my dad.

33
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,380
Harry's my friend. I'm not gonna just abandon him.

34
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,680
I'm going back to Earth-2.

35
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,610
Now I am the ruler of Gorilla City,

36
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,470
and all the gorillas will follow anything I order.

37
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,090
Grodd the gorilla,

38
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,110
he's talking through Wells?

39
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,940
Yeah.

40
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,090
Who is this gorgeous intruder?

41
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,310
Her name is Gypsy.

42
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,650
She's a Collector.

43
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,090
Open a breach!

44
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,770
Time to warp out of this madhouse.

45
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,590
You will open the breaches,

46
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:02,590
and Central City will fall before Grodd.

47
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,620
Barry?

48
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,380
- Good morning. - Good morning.

49
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,520
You're in a good mood for 6:30 in the morning.

50
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,670
Yes, I am.

51
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,550
Was I too loud?

52
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,840
I did make breakfast.

53
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,820
We got pancakes and waffles,

54
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,870
some French toast,

55
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,900
bacon and sausage, perfectly cooked.

56
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,860
and I picked up some of that dark roast that you love so much.

57
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,100
Barry Allen, what has gotten into you?

58
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,320
Being with you makes me want to do things like this.

59
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,960
Come here.

60
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,710
I love you.

61
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,510
I love you.

62
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,910
So do you actually want any of this, or...

63
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,310
Yes.

64
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,620
And some of the food too.

65
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,100
Yeah.

66
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,010
Nice.

67
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,300
What...

68
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,260
are you doing?

69
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,530
I'm decorating!

70
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,930
Look at this place!

71
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,560
You're decorating the Speed Lab?

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,310
Yes, I'm decorating the Speed Lab.

73
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,370
You know, 'cause Francisco, you know,

74
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,420
he wouldn't let me decorate the Cortex,

75
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,090
'cause I made it look oh-so-jolly for Christmastime.

76
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,790
What are the balls for?

77
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,770
Do you know what those are? Lanterns.

78
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,040
You know what I always say: a fella that can't tell

79
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,380
the difference between balls and lanterns

80
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,100
is in trouble when the lights go out.

81
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,030
You go front to back.

82
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,960
Toothbrushing. You go front to back?

83
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,370
'Cause I'm a small circles kind of guy.

84
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,530
I wonder how the other Wells brushes his teeth.

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,740
- The murderer? - I'm fascinated

86
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,010
by the subtle differences between us, you know?

87
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,390
- And the not-so-subtle ones. - Like what?

88
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,590
Like the fact that I'm a genius and you're a moron.

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,930
Okay.

90
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,090
See you at the party.

93
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,390
Wow. What a transformation.

94
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,540
Again!

95
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,330
So this is H.R.'s contribution to the team?

97
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,850
Being Martha Stewart?

98
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,460
Guys, he's just trying to do something nice.

99
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,410
Heads up!

100
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,540
I'm not really good with this kind of thing.

101
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,650
You know what I got to do?

102
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,100
I got to take some lessons

103
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,700
from that guy in the green elf suit over there in Star City,

104
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,420
- what's his name? - Green Arrow.

105
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,520
Hey, what is all this?

106
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,900
Friend's Day!

107
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,990
- What? - Yeah.

108
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,930
- Friend's Day. - Friend's?

109
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,090
Oh, it's my Earth's equivalent

110
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,220
- of Valentine's Day. - Valentine's Day.

111
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,910
And I thought, like, after, you know,

112
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,230
our success with the gorillas,

113
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,150
that we should, like, celebrate the love.

114
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,970
Was all this necessary?

115
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,880
Yeah, Joe. Speaking of, where is your--

116
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,060
your lady friend? 'Cause I would like to--

117
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,100
No, you wouldn't like to do anything.

118
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,580
She's at work, which is where I should be going.

119
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
Yeah, I...

120
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,500
Look what I have, ladies and gentlemen.

121
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,750
I have your own personal Friend's Day card.

122
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,230
For yours truly, Ms. West.

123
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,290
- Thank you, H.R. - Captain.

124
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,200
- Thanks, H.R. - Leader of the ship.

125
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,900
- Thank-- thank you. - You're so welcome.

126
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,540
Oh, hi, Jesse "So Quick".

127
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,580
Yeah, I also made one for your grumpy old dad.

128
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,890
Ah, you know what I like?

129
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,070
- Yo' vibe. - Thank you.

130
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,790
Caitlyn.

131
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,310
I forgot the coffee!

132
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,930
"You have sped into my heart, Jesse Quick."

133
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,260
Oh, well, I guess that makes two of us.

134
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,710
Wow, H.R. is nothing like my dad.

135
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,120
He's so sweeten and thoughtful and understanding.

136
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,290
We should tell him.

137
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,300
Tell your dad about you moving here?

138
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,080
- Yeah. - Um, now?

139
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,200
Yeah, I mean, H.R. said there'd never be a perfect time.

140
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
Just got to rip the Band-Aid off.

141
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,190
- Yeah. - Okay, let's do it.

142
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,290
H.R. does make a good point.

143
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,470
Yeah, what's that?

144
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,200
It was a really big win for the team, beating Grodd.

145
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,140
I mean, we stopped a gorilla attack from happening.

146
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,810
Yeah, look at you, changing the future.

147
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,300
We're all changing the future,

148
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,020
one headline at a time.

149
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,990
Look, I don't know what the future's gonna bring,

150
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,540
but I hope every day is with you.

151
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,390
Which is why I wanted to ask you...

152
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,820
Barry Allen,

153
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,280
will you be my friend?

154
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,390
Always.

155
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,460
H.R. made this for you.

156
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,190
H.R. is an idiot.

157
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,510
So there's something I've been meaning to tell you.

158
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,630
- Okay. - So I-I'm just gonna say it.

159
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,830
I think that's wise.

160
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,060
I'm gonna move to Earth-1.

161
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,330
What?

162
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,430
- I'm gonna stay here. - Why would you do that?

163
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,970
Grodd is no longer a threat.

164
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,490
No, it's-- it's not that. Uh...

165
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,550
I want to be with Wally.

166
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,620
This whole thing has made us realize

167
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,210
that we have no idea what's gonna happen, you know, and--

168
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,500
And if we're gonna go through something,

169
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,030
we want to go through it together.

170
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,250
Yeah.

171
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,490
This guy?

172
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,930
You like him?

173
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,290
Yeah.

174
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,660
He makes you happy?

175
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,770
Dad...

176
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,490
Okay.

177
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,570
That's it?

178
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,950
You're not gonna yell?

179
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,350
You're not gonna throw that over there?

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,760
Your happiness is what matters to me.

181
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,140
You're both adults.

182
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,980
I respect your decision.

183
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,190
Don't screw it up.

184
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,640
Okay, that was weird.

185
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,230
I guess that this means that we gotta find you a place.

186
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,780
Me? More like us.

187
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,280
You know, sometimes it seems like everybody else

188
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,100
gets to have their love doughnut.

189
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,600
Where's my love doughnut?

190
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,380
Oh, love is complicated.

191
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,930
So, uh, where's Julian?

192
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,520
He's taking care of some family matters in London.

193
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,950
Just so you know,

194
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,290
we are just friends.

195
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,450
Yeah, the friend zone. I know it well.

196
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,280
Pretty sure I have a permanent residence here.

197
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,030
You know, maybe I should just swallow the pill.

198
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,070
Maybe my game just ain't strong.

199
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,430
Your game is so strong!

200
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,210
For what it's worth,

201
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,470
I think Lisa Snart was totally into you.

202
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,410
Lisa Snart.

203
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,720
Not that I would actually let you date her.

204
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,470
Cisco, I promise, there is a beautiful,

205
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,160
intelligent woman out there who's gonna challenge you

206
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,080
to be your best version of yourself.

207
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,010
In fact, she could be right around the corner.

208
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,520
Gypsy!

209
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,130
Who the hell is this?

210
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,340
Where am I?

211
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
Why am I locked up?

212
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,660
My powers don't work in here.

213
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,050
Yeah, it's kind of the point of the cell.

214
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,110
What happened?

215
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,940
I thought we were all on the same page.

216
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,580
I spared your life, and you said you'd go back to Earth-19

217
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,280
and tell everyone you killed H.R.

218
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,830
That's exactly what I did.

219
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,090
I told the council you were dead.

220
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't believe you.

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
I didn't come here to take you back!

222
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,990
I'm telling you!

223
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,480
Then why are you here?

224
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,160
I don't know.

225
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,740
The last thing I remember, I was on Earth-2...

226
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,080
hunting down another breacher.

227
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,810
Wait, you were just on Earth-2?

228
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,970
Where?

229
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,420
In the African jungle,

230
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,980
where I saw...

231
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,570
Let me guess, a gorilla?

232
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,890
Super tall? Anger management issues?

233
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,500
Grodd must have taken control of her

234
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,020
and sent her here to kill us.

235
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,620
Yeah, but she's on a different Earth than him,

236
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,580
and Grodd's telepathy can't cross dimensions like that.

237
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,300
Grodd said he always thinks ahead.

238
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,470
Just like the Reverse-Flash.

239
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,470
He didn't have you to open a breach,

240
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,920
so he used Gypsy instead.

241
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,360
So that means...

242
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,320
Grodd's here.

243
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,420
Something tells me he's not alone.

244
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,010
Any sign of him yet?

245
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,820
Not since you asked 30 seconds ago.

246
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,240
Okay, he's a giant gorilla,

247
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,690
who's probably leading an army of giant gorillas.

248
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,710
How can you not find him?

249
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,700
He's probably figured out a way

250
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,770
- to scramble our satellites. - Satellites.

251
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,960
We're talking about a genius super-ape here.

252
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,210
And a master strategist

253
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,220
who successfully fooled us on my Earth.

254
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,950
We Wellses, we don't fool easy, do we, hard hat?

255
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,150
Don't call me "Hard hat""

256
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,600
We have to find him before he hurts somebody else.

257
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,560
Don't worry, Barry, we will.

258
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,760
Every time I think we've beat him,

259
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,110
he comes back stronger, smarter,

260
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,260
and more dangerous.

261
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,360
He's evolving.

262
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,520
I keep trying to fight him the same way.

263
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,150
Okay, guys, look, we just have to come up

264
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,320
with a different way to beat him.

265
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,290
What we need to do is get ahead of him for once.

266
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,910
We can. You've seen the future.

267
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,990
You know there's an attack.

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,950
If we just figure out where that attack happens,

269
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,120
we can launch a preemptive strike against Grodd.

270
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,190
We can stop the attack before it ever starts.

271
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,600
And fortunately, we have someone

272
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,400
who can foresee future events.

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,120
Before they happen.

274
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,830
Okay, okay, there's only one problem.

275
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,290
I can only vibe what Barry saw,

276
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,600
and a ticker on the side of a bus stop

277
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,140
doesn't give us a whole lot of info.

278
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,220
What if we widen the scope of your vibe?

279
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,870
Then you can see more of the future.

280
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,980
Yes. I can do that.

281
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,280
Just need to borrow your vibe gear.

282
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,840
- Harry, that's my only pair. - I'll be careful.

283
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,370
- It's my only pair. - West, come with me.

284
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,640
- You have an engineer's mind. - Yeah, sure.

285
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,810
Happy to help.

286
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,180
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

287
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,410
Can you talk to Joe, see if he can rally CCPD?

288
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,450
Yeah, yeah, I'll let him know that

289
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,010
an army of sentient gorillas is about to storm the city.

290
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,720
He's gonna love that.

291
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,820
What about Gypsy? She's a really powerful meta.

292
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,100
Yeah, but how do we know she's not a Grodd sleeper agent?

293
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,260
She's not. I checked her out.

294
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,550
Can you convince her to help?

295
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,840
Bro, she won't say no to me.

296
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,870
No way.

297
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
You've got three speedsters, an ice queen,

298
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,740
and a guy who vibes almost as well as I do.

299
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,600
You don't need my help to stop Grodd.

300
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,830
Need I remind you, you're the one

301
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,420
who brought Grodd here in the first place.

302
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,590
Not by choice!

303
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,340
I was chasing a fugitive from my world on Earth-2

304
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,860
when Grodd ambushed me

305
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,540
and turned me into his damn puppet.

306
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,830
Okay, so then this is the perfect opportunity

307
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,500
for payback, right?

308
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,270
Don't tell me you're gonna run away from this.

309
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,530
I never run.

310
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,990
Then stand and fight with us.

311
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,560
We need you.

312
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,410
You need me?

313
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,380
Are you trying to Luke Starkiller me?

314
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,720
What if I am?

315
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,930
Is that what it's gonna take to get you to stay?

316
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,010
Here's a bonus:

317
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,960
you get to spend extra time with this face.

318
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,360
And look at this face. Come on.

319
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,930
Who doesn't want to get to spend extra time with this guy?

320
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,520
What?

321
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,280
The things I saw, when Grodd was in control of my mind,

322
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,980
the horrors in that monster's head,

323
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,320
I can never un-see them.

324
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,190
What horrors?

325
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,570
The city in ruins.

326
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,550
People in pain. Death everywhere.

327
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,930
That's what Grodd wants, what he's planning.

328
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,450
I'm sorry, Cisco.

329
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,680
This is your fight. Not mine.

330
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,110
Now, if you don't mind,

331
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,760
I still have a fugitive to catch, so...

332
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,360
Okay.

333
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,990
I understand.

334
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,000
Take care of yourself, Cisco.

335
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,680
Admit it. You are so into me.

336
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,550
West.

337
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,160
How are we coming along with that gear?

338
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,060
I've made all the adjustments you asked for,

339
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,100
so we should be good to go.

340
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,370
Good. Thank you.

341
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,910
Great.

342
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,550
Um, how exactly is this gonna help Cisco vibe any differently?

343
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,680
Ah, simple science.

344
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,450
We just broaden the overall harmonic resonance

345
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,240
of Cisco's vibrational frequencies

346
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,210
all while focusing them on a fixed temporal locus.

347
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,310
- Couldn't be easier. - Yeah.

348
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,260
You know, I got to admit, Harry,

349
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,880
I was super surprised at how cool you were

350
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,220
with Jesse staying on this Earth.

351
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,730
I thought, for sure, you were gonna freak out

352
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,060
and throw something or throw someone.

353
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,690
Well, my daughter's happiness is of the utmost importance to me.

354
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,550
And you make her happy.

355
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,070
I'm gonna do everything in my power to keep it that way.

356
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,570
I appreciate that, West.

357
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,670
I'm sure Jesse will too, after I'm... gone.

358
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,880
We're gonna come visit you on Earth-2 a bunch,

359
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,940
so you don't have to worry about that, Harry.

360
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,960
Yeah, right.

361
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,920
Uh, well, means the world to me,

362
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,830
seeing as I don't know how much time I have left.

363
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,910
Wait, y-you're sick?

364
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm not as well as I once was.

365
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,320
Have you seen a doctor?

366
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,230
Yes.

367
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,750
I have seen a doctor, West.

368
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,220
Is it serious?

369
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,480
Oh, man, Harry.

370
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,070
Man. Um...

371
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,540
- I'm sorry. - Me too.

372
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,000
Does Jesse know?

373
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,950
Appreciate you keep this between...us.

374
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,930
She doesn't know, and we wouldn't want to upset her.

375
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,340
SWAT's ready to roll whenever y'all are.

376
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,220
We find Grodd yet?

377
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,850
We're about to.

378
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,140
Cisco, you ready?

379
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,560
Harry, this thing, if it fries my brain--

380
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,810
"It's an improvement."

381
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,430
- Was that "Rocky"? - Yeah, Burgess Meredith.

382
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,700
Yeah, I'm ready.

383
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,280
Word of warning. Vibing blind,

384
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,040
it's like surfing a monster wave.

385
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,800
You need to stay above the temporal flow,

386
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,150
otherwise your consciousness can get sucked under.

387
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,460
And then what happens?

388
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,360
I don't know.

389
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,950
Guess we'll find out.

390
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
Wait, what?

391
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,780
Where are you, Ramon? What do you see?

392
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,640
I'm at an intersection.

395
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,110
State and Oakhill.

396
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,400
I think this is where it goes down.

397
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,460
That's a block away from the bridge.

398
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,050
That leads right to the heart of town.

399
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:35,250
If those gorillas get over that bridge...

400
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,810
They'll overrun the city in no time.

401
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,460
Not if we stop them first.

402
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,310
Eyes wide, everybody.

403
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,620
Grodd's army could be here any second, all right?

404
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,560
There's no sign of them.

405
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,760
You sure this is the right place?

406
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,450
According to Cisco, this is it.

407
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,760
Was it the right time?

408
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,180
We're too early.

409
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,440
No, Flash.

410
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,930
Too late.

411
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,300
- Grodd. - I remember,

412
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,320
this human is important to you.

413
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,810
Now...

414
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,470
he's all mine.

415
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,440
No! Hey!

416
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,410
Do not hurt him. I'm the one you want! Right?

417
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,210
I warned you, Flash.

418
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,020
And now I'm here on First Earth

419
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,340
to make good on my promise.

420
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,110
And when I'm finished, this city

421
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,620
and all the puny humans

422
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,390
will die.

423
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,360
No!

424
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,400
Joe!

425
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,340
Are you okay?

426
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,880
I think so.

427
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,830
I don't get it.

428
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,110
How is attacking Detective Joe West

429
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,320
a part of Grodd's plan?

430
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,110
- It wasn't. - Then what was it?

431
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,220
A distraction.

432
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,280
I don't care if Senator Ford is having doubts.

433
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,100
If the secretary doesn't approve that budget

434
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,050
first thing in the morning,

435
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,150
we're gonna have to make some serious cuts--

436
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,830
The hell was that?

437
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,000
That damn gorilla almost got me this time.

438
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,390
Shouldn't even have a scar.

439
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,700
Do you remember anything

440
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,250
from when Grodd was controlling you?

441
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,760
Not really. Just some flashes.

442
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,920
Flashes of what?

443
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,880
They were, like, these images...

444
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,330
places I've never seen before.

445
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,370
It was like I was seeing what he was seeing.

446
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,120
Gypsy said the same thing.

447
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,270
Here we go. I know that look.

448
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,200
That's the "I have a genius idea" Look.

449
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,370
A couple years back on my Earth,

450
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,720
there was a neuroscientist

451
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,600
that was able to achieve memory recovery

452
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,410
using transcranial magnetic simulators on brain-damaged--

453
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,300
We use that here but more as a depression treatment.

454
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,170
Well, in this experiment, the neuroscientist

455
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,570
focused all the energy on the occipital cortex

456
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,450
of the patients, allowing them to achieve

457
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:17,190
almost full memory recollection.

458
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
So you think the connection Grodd creates

459
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,350
in the brains of those he mind-controls

460
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,860
goes both ways?

461
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,010
Could be.

462
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,020
Maybe we could use Grodd's memories

463
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,590
that he left behind in Joe to figure out what his plan is.

464
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,090
We'd just make some TCM simulators.

465
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,590
- All it takes is some... - Magnets.

466
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,700
Throw together some magnets, make a helmet out of 'em.

467
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,650
Hold on. Y'all want to put a bunch of magnets

468
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,470
against my skull to look into the mind

469
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,140
of a psychotic, murderous ape?

470
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,010
Yeah.

471
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,730
Fine.

472
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,510
Let's make it happen,

473
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,970
before Grodd tries to kill somebody else.

474
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,000
It's gonna be okay.

475
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,850
Is everything okay?

476
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,900
Just tired of seeing the people I care about

477
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,310
be put in harm's way.

478
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,790
Yeah, but like always,

479
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,700
we're gonna work together and come up with a plan.

480
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,140
We're gonna stop Grodd, Barry.

481
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,160
And then what?

482
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,160
We just send him back?

483
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,780
He's just gonna come here again.

484
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,820
We have to end this once and for all.

485
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,860
Wait.

486
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,310
What? You want to kill Grodd?

488
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,530
Why not?

489
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,990
That's how their society in Gorilla City works--

490
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,080
kill or be killed.

491
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,800
That's why he wanted me to kill Solovar.

492
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,880
And you know what? I should have.

493
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,810
I showed too much mercy.

494
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,840
No, you did what was right, Barry,

495
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,930
as you always do.

496
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,850
That's what makes you a hero.

497
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,270
Oliver has killed.

498
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,190
He's still considered a hero.

499
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,310
Yeah, and he lives with the weight of that decision

500
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,850
every single day.

501
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,510
I think that sometimes, the only way to stop

502
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,380
bad things from happening

503
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,760
is to just get rid of what's causing them.

504
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,510
What is this really about?

505
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,590
Grodd or what happens to me?

506
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,320
I kill Grodd, his attack never happens,that

507
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,550
changes the future, and...

508
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,250
you live, yeah.

509
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,450
Your humanity, showing mercy,

510
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,150
that is what separates you from everyone else.

511
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,400
That's the reason that everyone looks up to you.

512
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,400
Don't compromise who you are... ever.

513
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,210
Losing what makes The Flash The Flash--

514
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,750
my life isn't worth it if that's the cost to save me.

515
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,660
There you are.

516
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,580
Hey, you know your dad's gonna be all right.

517
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,270
What's wrong?

518
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,690
Look, I've been thinking, and I...

519
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,050
I don't think you should stay here.

520
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,750
I think... It was a bad idea.

521
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,020
Wally, you asked me.

522
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,570
Yeah, and I shouldn't have.

523
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,840
I think you should go back to Earth-2...

524
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,600
spend as much time with your dad as you can.

525
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,850
Spend as much time with my dad as I can?

526
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,310
Wally, what are you talking about?

527
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,340
Your dad is sick, Jesse. He's really sick.

528
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:38,050
He doesn't have much time left.

529
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,750
Did he tell you that?

530
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,500
I'm so sorry.

531
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,040
He is... unbelievable.

532
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,140
So all you have to do is concentrate

533
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,930
on your memories of Grodd, okay?

534
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah, that won't be a problem.

535
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,810
All right.

536
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,200
Hey, dead man.

537
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,820
Seriously?

538
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,320
You told Wally you were dying?

539
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,860
- Dying? - You're dying?

540
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,120
I didn't say I was, uh...

541
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,180
I-I said I didn't know how much time I had left.

542
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,220
- None of us-- - Okay, what is wrong with you?

543
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,560
Is there seriously nothing you won't say

544
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,130
to get me to stay by your side?

545
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,540
- I don't-- - Look, whatever.

546
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,650
I'm moving here, whether you like it or not.

547
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,470
So all you have to do is concentrate

548
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,040
- on your memories of Grodd. - Yeah.

549
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,230
- You ready? - Waiting on you, dead man.

550
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:34,270
Hey, if I start to Grodd out at any point,

551
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,790
cut the power off immediately.

552
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,920
Of course.

553
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,860
All right, Joe, you ready?

554
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,910
- Yeah. - All right, then.

555
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,640
So here... we... go.

556
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,640
Joe?

557
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,860
I didn't know he could draw.

558
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,310
Well, that's the thing. Anybody can actually draw.

559
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,560
It's just that some have more developed visual cortex

560
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,510
and manual ability, as you know.

561
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,220
And right now, these magnets are taking that part of his brain

562
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,980
and lightin' it up.

563
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,090
Well, it worked.

564
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,980
Now we have a new problem.

565
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,680
We have to figure out who the hell this is.

566
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,970
Good evening, General.

567
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,630
Color and number of the day.

568
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,030
Purple 246.

569
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,550
Are you all right, sir?

570
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Sick.

572
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,400
Good.

573
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,290
General.

575
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,520
Yo, Rocky.

576
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,740
How you doin'?

577
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,990
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

578
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,780
No matter what I do to stop Grodd,

579
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,360
he just keeps finding new ways to attack,

580
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,220
new ways to destroy, and I...

581
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,630
Iris doesn't think I should,

582
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,770
but the only way this ends is if I kill him.

583
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,420
Kill him.

584
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,340
That might be the most idiotic thing

585
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,770
I've ever heard you say.

586
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,860
- Wait, what? - Iris is right.

587
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,030
If you don't want to listen, go ahead,

588
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,260
keep being an idiot.

589
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,370
I don't understand.

590
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,290
Don't. Kill. Grodd.

591
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,290
Harry, you of all people should understand.

592
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,470
I mean, you would have killed to save Jesse.

593
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,360
You were gonna kill Zoom.

594
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,180
Barry, there's a thousand things

595
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,940
I've done that I'm not proud of.

596
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,390
Some of them recently.

597
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,810
Every time I do one of those things,

598
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,760
it makes it easier to do it the next time.

599
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,120
I look at you, out there battling the darkness,

600
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,670
with honor and hope, and I'm reminded

601
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,720
there's always another way,

602
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,750
always.

603
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,530
Killing Grodd is not your answer.

604
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,430
Saving one life doesn't justify taking another.

605
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,980
Find the other way.

606
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,910
Guys.

607
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,560
We need you in the cortex.

608
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,520
What's up, Cisco?

609
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,430
We've got a behemoth of a problem.

610
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,190
Terrific.

611
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,370
So we ran our John Doe image

612
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,910
through every database.

613
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,050
And it was tough. I mean, the guy's a ghost.

614
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,560
We've been calling him Jason Bourne.

615
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,120
But then H.R. noticed something.

616
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,660
Well, at first, it was a real brain-twister,

617
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,720
but then I remembered a quote

618
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,740
from a renowned poet from my Earth, Alfred Yankovic--

619
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,190
Are you talking about Weird Al?

620
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,140
Why? 'Cause of the hair?

621
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,510
Get to the point already, if you have one.

622
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,180
I can, hard hat. It's his hair.

623
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,550
Standard military cut.

624
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,800
So we ran the image through

625
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,860
the Department of Defense database, and,

626
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,890
as Cisco would say, "Yahtzee."

627
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,330
I would say that.

628
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,280
Nice work, H.R.

629
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,380
I know.

630
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,500
DoD has him listed as

631
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,830
Air Force General Matthew McNally.

632
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,920
General Matthew McNally, and I'll give you one guess--

633
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,250
just guess what he's in charge of.

634
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,790
I know you're gonna say military weapons,

635
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,300
but I really hope you don't say military weapons.

636
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,620
It's worse, Barr.

637
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,390
Nuclear missiles.

638
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,570
McNally has the highest clearance.

639
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,810
He can have a rocket in the air in less than ten minutes.

640
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,520
So are the satellites back to functional?

641
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,640
We ran a full diagnostic.

642
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,970
Any nuclear weapon that's authorized to fire,

643
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,180
- an alarm will sound - Okay, good.

644
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,710
Does it sound like that? That's an alarm.

645
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,900
Yeah, it's that alarm, H.R.

646
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,510
Okay.

647
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,510
Short-range ballistic missile

648
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,350
authorized to fire from Fort Reynolds.

649
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,620
How much time do we have?

650
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,560
Minutes.

651
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,890
Grodd, what have you done?

652
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,080
Can we stop it from here?

653
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,620
Military weapons are basically analog.

654
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,510
I mean, they still use floppy disks.

655
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,920
I'm going after it.

656
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,100
Guys, no, look, I appreciate it,

657
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,230
but I need you to stay here, okay?

658
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,560
If I can't stop it,

659
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,410
I need you to get everybody to safety, okay?

661
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,490
All right, I'm with the missile.

662
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,780
Barry, to access the keypad, remove the panel

663
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,590
at the base of the missile vehicle.

664
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,050
All right.

665
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,700
All right, that's done. What's next?

666
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,800
Well, the good news is, this missile

667
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,780
has a built-in five-digit kill code.

668
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,800
Great. What is it?

669
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,480
That's the bad news. We don't know.

670
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,820
For real? Ah, well, then what am I supposed to do?

671
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,520
You have to try every combination, Barry.

672
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,570
It's okay; with this type of launcher,

673
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,590
you won't set off the nuke.

674
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,180
Barry, simulators are projecting

678
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,930
that hundreds of thousands will die.

679
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,890
Yeah, let's hope not.

680
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,220
Come on.

681
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,580
Five digits. How many combos is that?

682
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,980
- I'm guessing it's about... - Precisely 90,000,

683
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,260
which you would know if you weren't a moron

684
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,990
and you were an actual genius.

685
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,560
Two missiles are locked on target.

686
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,980
Guys, we need something else. This isn't working.

687
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,690
Plan B, anyone?

688
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,690
Work!

689
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,500
How much time does he have?

690
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,810
15 seconds.

691
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,120
Guys, I need something! This isn't working!

692
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,260
Something else!

693
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,970
You just got to keep going, Barry.

694
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,100
You just--just got to keep trying.

695
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,810
Six missiles are locked on target.

696
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,850
It worked.

697
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,500
It worked! We did it!

699
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,560
We did it!

700
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,230
Oh, thank God.

701
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,610
Flash stopped the weapon.

702
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,280
But he can't stop us all.

703
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,340
Attack!

704
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,190
Found them.

705
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,280
They're right outside the city.

706
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,480
Heading for State and Oakhill, fast.

707
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,800
Which leads right into downtown.

708
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,630
All right, so what do we do?

709
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,390
Barry, I know

710
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,310
we're speedsters and everything,

711
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,130
but we are way outnumbered here.

712
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,500
Yeah, I mean, he's right; how are the three of us

713
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,920
gonna take on all those gorillas?

714
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,120
We have to.

715
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,650
As much as I hate these gorillas,

716
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,620
especially Grodd, if you kill him,

717
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,600
the other ones might stand down,

718
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,270
but you might not be able to come back from this, Barry.

719
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,580
You know that, right?

720
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,130
I know.

721
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,020
But there's another way.

722
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,490
It's not gonna come to that.

723
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,530
Cisco, I'm gonna need your help.

724
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,510
Tracked her down on Earth-2.

725
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,660
Breach is taken care of.

727
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,930
Thank you.

728
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,070
Risky move coming to an Earth

729
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,890
where interdimensional travel is punishable by death.

730
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,780
Especially when I'm the one

731
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,470
who's supposed to uphold that law.

732
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,380
I need to talk to you.

733
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,050
I don't do long-distance relationships.

734
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,280
Don't get me wrong; this is something

735
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,650
I'd love to talk about in more detail,

736
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,870
especially if distance is your only hesitation.

737
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,440
But I'm here to talk about Grodd.

738
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,710
Okay, I see you don't take no for an answer.

739
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,820
Gypsy, please.

740
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,860
He's gonna destroy my city.

741
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,760
And he's gonna hurt the people I love.

742
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,920
I told you before, that's not my problem.

743
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,290
Look, just go back to Earth-1 before someone sees you

744
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,320
and I have to do something that I don't want to.

745
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,120
You know, you told me I could do things with my powers

746
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,590
I'd never even imagined, and you're right,

747
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,980
'cause I'm not just vibing people anymore.

748
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,440
I'm vibing what they feel.

749
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,590
And you know what I'm getting from you,

750
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,210
right here, right now?

751
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,500
You're more than this. You're like me.

752
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,190
You want to do something good.

753
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,620
Look, we need something to stop Grodd,

754
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,430
and I'm gonna need your help getting it.

755
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,450
Please, be the hero I know you want to be.

756
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,780
Wells, how long do we have?

757
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,640
Two minutes, Barry.

758
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,500
Two minutes? Ten seconds!

759
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,160
Can you not even tell time?

760
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,630
That's what I said. Ten seconds.

761
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,090
So got any pointers on how the three of us

762
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,110
are gonna save everyone and stop a few hundred gorillas?

763
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,210
Go for the legs?

764
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,090
Just try not to get caught,

765
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,580
'cause, trust me, they won't let go.

766
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,410
Well, that was not the start we're looking for.

767
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,620
Because...

768
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,820
How long do they have to last?

769
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,380
Hopefully not much longer.

770
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,070
Your city will fall, Flash.

771
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,150
There's only one way to end this.

772
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,680
You kill me.

773
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,990
But you won't do that.

774
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,840
All you care about is mercy.

775
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,220
Yeah, you're right.

776
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,380
Except I'm not the only one that wants to stop you.

777
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,930
Solovar!

778
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:49,350
I challenge you, Grodd!

779
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,840
And you will fall again!

780
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,660
Good-bye, Grodd.

781
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,180
Stop! Stop...

782
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,710
Death isn't the way.

783
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,650
He betrayed me.

784
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:12,520
I know, so leave him here, where he's from.

785
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,510
We won't let him go back to Gorilla City ever again.

786
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,640
Just spare his life, like I spared yours.

787
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,130
Send us home...

788
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,380
all of us.

789
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,750
How long is it gonna take

790
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,190
to put 100 gorillas through a breach?

791
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,950
We're gonna be here all night. You know what I ought to do?

792
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,560
Whip us up some cappuccino--

793
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,490
All the gorillas are back on Earth-2.

794
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,810
And Grodd?

795
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,030
I called Lyla. He's with A.R.G.U.S.

796
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,280
Good. I don't know about y'all,

797
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,440
but I don't ever need to see

798
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,900
a super-smart, telepathic gorilla again.

799
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,880
I'm with you.

800
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,030
Not that Grodd didn't have

801
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,630
some justification for mistrusting humans.

802
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,920
Whatever good was in Grodd is gone.

803
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,220
As far as I'm concerned, they can throw him

804
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,260
in the same cage as King Shark.

805
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,400
I'd pay money to see that fight.

806
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,010
All right, well, if the city doesn't need my help anymore,

807
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,720
I'm gonna head back to Earth-19.

808
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,820
Oh, really?

809
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:21,190
So you did all this for the city, huh?

810
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,780
'Cause I'm pretty sure there's a different reason

811
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,180
you chose to help us.

812
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,500
That's right. I was the only one

813
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,910
who knew where Solovar was.

814
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,420
Right, yeah. How could I forget?

815
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,220
Don't front.

816
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,800
You're into me.

817
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,410
Look, Cisco, I mean,

818
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,740
even if I was...

819
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,280
you couldn't handle me.

820
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,440
- Bye, guys. - Bye.

821
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,360
I'll marry that woman.

822
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,470
Yeah.

823
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,020
Okay, I better get this story in before I lose my job.

824
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,070
Okay.

825
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,660
You sure you still don't want to look into the future

826
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,170
and see what's changed?

827
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,110
No.

828
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,790
Think I'm done with that.

829
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:14,010
- Good. - I'll see you at home.

830
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,560
Hey, I'll walk out with you.

831
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,100
I got a date with Cecile.

832
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,900
Come on, guys. Let's go find Harry.

833
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,620
To review: this is my daughter.

834
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:30,530
There's nothing more important to me.

835
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,980
So you do right by my daughter,

836
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,730
or there is nowhere in the multiverse

837
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,190
I won't find you.

838
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,440
Dad.

839
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,260
They'd have to kill me.

840
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,720
Bye.

841
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,210
Bye.

842
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,570
Bye, Jesse Quick.

843
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,000
Always another way, Flash.

844
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,140
Always.

845
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,000
Babe?

846
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,550
Is that Grandma Esther's noodles?

847
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,060
And there's mint chocolate chip in the freezer.

848
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,870
And these are for you.

849
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,470
What is all this?

850
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,180
I've been really busy recently with...

851
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,560
trying to avoid the future.

852
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,480
And I forgot that there's always another way.

853
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,050
What is that?

854
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,750
Making the future...

855
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,880
our future.

856
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,370
My great-grandfather gave this to my great-grandmother

857
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,840
after World War II.

858
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,000
He wanted to propose before he was shipped out,

859
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,050
but he--he didn't have the money.

860
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,230
And he bought this three years later

861
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,990
when he was stationed in London.

862
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:18,860
Fought his way across France, all the way to Berlin,and

863
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,110
this ring...

864
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,240
around his neck with his dog tags.

865
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,340
And when he got back, she was waiting for him on the dock

866
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,060
of the Brooklyn Navy Yards.

867
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,390
He proposed on the spot.

868
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,420
After my mom passed away,

869
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,180
Joe held on to this for me...

870
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,540
until tonight.

871
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,480
- Barry... - Iris West,

872
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,750
will you marry me?

873
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,350
Yeah.

874
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,950
Inside of us, we both know you belong with Victor.

875
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,210
You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going.

876
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,650
Okay, I'm so confused.

877
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,540
Is it supposed to be about the War of the Americas?

878
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,140
Do you not like it? 'Cause this is my favorite movie.

879
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,310
No, no, I didn't say that.

880
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,420
I guess we just have more wars on my Earth.

881
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,630
Well, we can just watch something else.

882
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,940
Or we don't have to watch anything at all.

883
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:28,060
You know what I could go for?

884
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,680
Big Belly Burger.

885
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,620
I'll be right back.

886
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,570
Thank you.
