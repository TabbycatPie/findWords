00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,980
So you're really
staying here tonight?

651
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,848
Tonight.
Tomorrow night.

652
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,617
The night after that.

653
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,689
Do you think that
Eddie is cheating on me?

654
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,928
No.
Eddie's not that kind of guy.

655
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,363
Well, then
I don't know what else

656
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:13,831
he could be hiding from me.

657
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,168
Iris...

658
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,873
Remember when we were kids,

659
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:26,577
and Joe would come home
from work

660
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,280
with that blank expression
on his face?

661
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,182
[chuckles]
Yeah.

662
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,851
The "Earth to Joe" look.

663
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,052
How could I forget?

664
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,687
(Barry)
I never understood that look

665
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:41,392
until I started
working for the CCPD.

666
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:45,596
Showing up at crime scenes and
seeing someone murdered--

667
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:49,133
it can be ugly work.

668
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:50,868
(Barry)
And I'm lucky.

669
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,803
I get to hide behind
the science of it

670
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,638
and just stay in my lab,

671
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,407
but Eddie,

672
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:01,945
he's out there every day
in the darkness.

673
00:28:01,947 --> 00:28:04,882
I just--I think that maybe

674
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:07,618
if he doesn't want to talk
