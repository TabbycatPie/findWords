- Maybe.

I've just been offered a fellowship

- Yes!

23
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,409
Good boys. Okay.

24
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,707
Remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet.

25
00:01:18,803 --> 00:01:20,721
See you tonight.

26
00:01:21,268 --> 00:01:24,435
So, the life of a television reporter
is very rewarding,

27
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:28,211
and I strongly urge you
to consider it as a career.

28
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:30,224
Thank you.

29
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,304
- Yeah.
- Do you have a fiancé?

30
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:38,834
Marshall was here yesterday.
They just learned the word 'fiancé.'

31
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,658
No, I don't have a fiancé.

32
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:41,937
Then who do you live with?

33
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:45,033
Well, actually, I've got five dogs.

34
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:47,055
Don't you get Ionely?

35
00:01:47,089 --> 00:01:49,260
No, I've got five dogs.

36
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:52,625
My Grandma has five cats
and she gets Ionely.

37
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:56,113
Well, yeah, that's cats.
I'm not some pathetic cat lady.

38
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:58,256
Not that your grandmother is...

39
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,888
Does anyone else have a...

40
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,873
- Yes.
- Are you a lesbian?

41
00:02:01,968 --> 00:02:05,360
No, are you? Just because a woman
lives alone doesn't mean she's a...

42
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:09,008
Okay. Let's have a big hand
for Robin the reporter!

All right, our next guest is another friend...

44
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:17,839
So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks
'cause I just saw one. What up. Tiny five.

45
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:21,871
Laugh now. Those kids are monsters.
They're gonna eat you alive.

47
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:26,614
- What do you do?
- Please.

48

Kids, let's rap.

You guys don't give half a brown Crayola
what I do for a living, do you?

50
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,373
- KIDS: No.
- No, no. I know what you want.

51
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:38,982
- Magic.
- Yeah!

52
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:41,230
- Hello?
- Why hasn't she called yet?

53
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:42,925
Okay, you're making yourself crazy.

54
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:45,038
It's Saturday night.
Go out and do something.

55
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:49,037
No, what's the point of going out?
I got a girlfriend. For now.

56
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,669
Besides, if I go out,
who's gonna watch the news?

57
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:51,885
I'm like half your viewership.

58
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:55,567
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.

MAN: And, we're clear.

60
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:00,012
So, Scherbatsky. Got a boyfriend?

61
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:02,860
No, and why does this
keep coming up today?

62
00:03:02,956 --> 00:03:04,588
I just thought that guy you
were on the phone with...

63
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,371
What? Oh, no. That was Ted.
He's just a friend.

64
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:10,059
I mean, there was this moment
where we almost dated,

65
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:12,460
but we want completely different things.

66
00:03:12,556 --> 00:03:14,315
Anyway, now he has his girlfriend
in Germany...

67
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,043
and he thinks she's calling
to dump him tonight,

68
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,579
but I don't think she is.

69
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:20,235
And, besides,
we want completely different things.

70
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,752
- We should have sex.
- What?

71
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,235
Why not?

72
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:27,275
We're both available. We're both
attractive. We're both good at it.

73
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:28,810
At least, I'm good at it.

74
00:03:28,906 --> 00:03:32,458
And even if you're not, don't worry.
I'll have a good time either way.

75

clanging against the headboard,

77
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,977
I don't get involved with people I work with.

78
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:43,913
Get involved? Who said get involved?
I'm just saying we should have sex.

79
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,417
- MAN: We're on in five, four...
- It'd be fun.

80
00:03:45,513 --> 00:03:47,431
Having sex is fun.

81
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:49,161
Home number. Call me anytime.

82
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:52,435
A lot of local teams in action tonight.

83
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,422
Hey, guys.

84
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:59,430
Miss me?

85
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:04,101
I missed you, too.

86
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:51,810
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.

87
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:56,855
Listen, I know it's late,
but do you want to come over?

88
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:06,208
- Ted?
- Yeah. Hi, I'm here.

89
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,853
- Do you want to come over?
- Why? What's up?

90
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,578
Well, I just finally set up my new juicer,

91
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,858
and I was gonna make some juice.
And I was like,

92
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:20,562
'You know who likes juice? Ted.'

93
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:23,234
I love juice.

94
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:27,079
Great, so you want to come over
and make juice?

95
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,016
<i>When it's after 2:00 a.m. Just go to sleep.</i>

96
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:34,145
<i>Because the decisions you make after
2:00 a.m. Are the wrong decisions.</i>

97
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:37,175
Okay, sure, I'll come over, we'll...

98
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:39,616
- juice.
- Yes, we'll juice.

99
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:42,330
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

100
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,246
Bye.

101
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,415
This is fine. This is totally fine.

102
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,663
What's fine?

103
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,471
Oh, I'm going over to this girl's house
to make some juice.

104
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,527
Nice.

105
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:02,046
No, it's not like that.
We're juicing as friends.

106
00:06:02,142 --> 00:06:04,095
See, I have this girlfriend.

107
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,326
I would never cheat on her.
She lives in Germany.

108
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:11,326
See, she was supposed to call me
four hours ago to have a serious taIk.

109
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:14,238
I still haven't heard from her. I don't know.

110
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,509
Sorry to bug you with my problems.

111
00:06:16,605 --> 00:06:20,273
Guess cab drivers
are the new bartenders, huh?

112
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:22,267
You ain't kidding, kid.

113
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:24,573
Want a nip?

114
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,421
You could just let me out right up here.

115
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:32,380
- Where are you going to buddy?
- Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth.

116
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,877
Okay, here's where I left off
with the last guy.

117
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:38,076
See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over
to this other girl's house...

118
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:40,412
And you're wondering if I'd be upset.

119
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:42,844
Hi, Ted. Remember me? Your girlfriend.

120
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,955
Okay, relax. Robin's just a friend.

121
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,323
Right. You're gonna go make some juice.

122
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,628
Yes, yes. Juice is perfectly harmless.

123
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:51,387
In fact, it's healthy.

124
00:06:51,483 --> 00:06:54,331
Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering
what she looks like naked?

125
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:55,835
I am not...

126
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,842
Okay, even if I am wondering that,
it's only 'cause you put it in my head.

127
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:01,243
But I am just a manifestation
of your subconscious,

128
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,354
so actually, you put it in your own head.

129
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,506
Damn it!

130
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:05,818
Nothing's gonna happen.

131
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:08,410
- Right.
- Okay, okay. You want a second opinion?

132
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,424
Fine.

134
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,738
Hey. Did she call?

135
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,751
No. I need a ruling.

136
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,761
I'm... Yeah, this is stupid.
It's not even a big deal,

137

but I'm on my way over to Robin's
right now.

138
00:07:24,217 --> 00:07:27,480
She got a new juicer. Whatever.
We're gonna test it out.

139
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,494
Let me call you back.

140
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:36,823
Honey, there's a situation developing.

141
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,936
Do you remember the huge secret
that you told me...

142
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:41,112
that you weren't supposed to, but you did?

143
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,872
The thing about Robin?

144
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:43,143
You mean, how Robin's in love with Ted?

145
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:44,088
You mean, how Robin's in love with Ted?

146
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:45,144
- What?
- What?

147
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,575
Yeah. She told me already. Go on.

148
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,751
Wait. So I'm the only one
that she didn't tell?

149
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:51,447
She told you and not me?

150
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:54,327
Well, I guess I'm just better friends
with her than you are.

151
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:57,079
Well, I'm better friends with Ted
than you are.

152

- That is a lie.
- It is not a lie.

- Okay, that's it. You and me.
- You think you can take me? Come on!

You can see straight down into Hell.

171
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:43,187
It's bad. You should go home, dude.

172
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:46,259
Marshall, it's fine.
Nothing's gonna happen.

173
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:49,395
- Ted, what does your Mom always say?
- Nothing good ever...

174
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:53,395
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.
Go home! It's too late for juice.

175
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:57,203
Dude, Robin and I are just friends.
She doesn't even like me that way.

176
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,722
Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.

177
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:02,354
- What?
- It's a big secret.

178
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,290
So don't tell her I told you,
but she's very vulnerable right now.

179
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:09,646
And you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.

180
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:11,753
<i>- She likes me?
- Yes.</i>

181
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:15,249
<i>So you see why it would be
a very bad idea for you to go up there.</i>

182
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:17,263
<i>Go home, Ted.</i>

183
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:19,759
She likes me?

184
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,743
Go home, Ted.

185
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:26,158
You're right, I'll see you at home.

186
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:29,582
Good. He's going home.

187
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,216
He is so not going home.

188
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:33,328
I cannot believe you just told him that.

189
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:35,632
- What do you mean?
- Lily, here's what you just said,

190
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:36,975
'Ted, whatever you do,

191
00:09:37,071 --> 00:09:40,335
'don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl
who wants to have sex with you.'

192
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:43,759
And then she's gonna
make you some delicious juice!

193
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:47,855
No. He's not going up there.
He has more sense than that.

194
00:09:47,951 --> 00:09:50,383
<i>OLDER TED: I did
have more sense than that.</i>

195
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,238
- Keep the change. Thanks.
- Thanks.

196
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:56,491
<i>But after 2:00 a.m.,
my good sense was sound asleep.</i>

197
00:10:05,859 --> 00:10:07,682
So, you're doing this?
You're going up there?

198
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,282
You want to get out of the way?

199
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:11,296
I'm not in the way.

200
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,832
You know, if you had just called me, I...

201
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:18,879
(EXHALES)...

202
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,951
- Hi!
- Hey.

203
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:24,225
I got some vegetables. I got carrots.
I got beets.

204
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:25,857
Or we could just drink wine.

205
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:29,921
Wine not. Wow, that's the stupidest thing
I ever said.

206
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:31,425
Thanks.

207
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:33,057
Make it a big glass.

208
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:34,913
Sure.

209
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:38,048
So, how's it hanging? 'How's it hanging?'

210
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:39,744
Haven't you ever had one of those days...

211
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,848
where nothing at all
that monumental happens,

212
00:10:42,944 --> 00:10:46,911
but, by the end of it, you have no idea
who you are anymore,

213
00:10:47,007 --> 00:10:49,376
or what the hell you're doing with your life?

214
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:51,327
Do you ever have one of those days?

215
00:10:51,423 --> 00:10:53,216
About once a week.

216
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,839
I don't know. It was just a rough day,

217
00:10:55,935 --> 00:11:00,826
and the only person I wanted to see
at the end of it was you.

218
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:05,854
So, how was the big phone call
with your girlfriend?

219
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,758
<i>OLDER TED: When the clock strikes two,
just go to sleep.</i>

220
00:11:09,854 --> 00:11:11,772
We broke up.

221
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,798
What?

222
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:14,622
Yeah. Yeah. She finally called.

223
00:11:14,718 --> 00:11:17,181
We taIked for a while.
How hard long distance is,

224
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,481
and then she dumped me.

225
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,621
Ted, I'm so sorry.

226
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,634
That's just terrible.

227
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:26,587
I feel awful.

228
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:28,221
You're smiling.

229
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:30,235
Am I? No, I'm not.

230
00:11:31,004 --> 00:11:32,348
Well, I'm a news anchor.

231
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,981
Smiling is a part of the job.

232
00:11:34,076 --> 00:11:36,700
Thousands died
in a tragic avalanche today.

233
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,714
See?

234
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,850
You're smiling, too.

235
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:45,211
Yeah.

236
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:48,323
I have no idea what that's all about.

237
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:54,490
(SINGING)

238
00:11:54,587 --> 00:11:56,538
How much does Korean Elvis rock?

239
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:59,001
I'll answer that. Infinity.

240
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,871
He rocks infinity.

241
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:04,122
Okay, it's time for bed.

242
00:12:04,218 --> 00:12:06,258
What? No. It's 2:30.

243
00:12:06,362 --> 00:12:08,922
And nothing good ever happens
after 2:00 a.m.

244
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,610
You know, I have found in my travels...

245
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:15,801
that all the best things in life
happen after 2:00 a.m.

246
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:18,105
When I look back
at the best stories of my life,

247
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:22,073
the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape
I got in at the Russian embassy,

248
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:24,025
- the almost four-way.
- You never had a four-way.

249
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,425
- I said 'almost'!
- Well, all right.

250
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:28,793
All those things happened after 2:00 a.m.

251
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:35,328
Because after 2:00 a.m. Is when things get,
audience, say it with me, legendary!

252
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,136
- We gotta go.
- What's that? 'Interesting theory, Barney,

253
00:12:38,232 --> 00:12:40,922
'but I'll need some proof.' Okay.

254
00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:47,767
Korean Elvis. How would you like
to have a drink with me and my friends?

255
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:49,781
Rock 'n' roll.

256
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,148
And it begins.

257
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,041
So, hey. I got a new phone.

258
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:58,838
Same as yours. Look.

259
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:00,972
Oh, yeah, do you like it?

260
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,028
Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:05,667
This is some solid small taIk.

262
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:08,310
I had that other phone, and it was good,

263
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:11,317
but I think, the whole time,
a little part of me...

264
00:13:11,413 --> 00:13:13,397
wanted this phone instead.

265
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,411
This phone...

266
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:17,269

268
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:20,533
Oh, wow. Weird.

269
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:23,400
Yeah, I should probably take this.

270
00:13:23,988 --> 00:13:25,906
I'll be here.

271
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:33,844
- Hello?
- Ted. This is your main man K.E.

272
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,404
I want you to shake your tail feather
down here ASAP. You dig?

273
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,639
Okay. Sorry about that.

274
00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:40,244
Who... Was that Korean Elvis?

275
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,507
I'll explain later.
Hey, we're heading down to MacLaren's.

276
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:46,799
Actually, I'm at Robin's.

277
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,610
Yeah, and I might have done
something bad.

278
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:54,450
I just lied and told her I broke up
with Victoria.

279
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:57,778
Ted, I don't want to swear
in front of Korean Elvis,

280
00:13:57,874 --> 00:14:00,370
but what the bleep are you doing, dude?

281
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,577
What do you expect from me? It's Robin!

282
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:05,423
Victoria's great, but it's Robin!

283
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:08,305
I've made up my mind,
I'm gonna end it with Victoria.

284
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,673
- Gonna?
- Yes. First thing tomorrow.

285
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,005
Okay, but as of right now,

286
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:17,261
at 2:45 a.m. You still have a girlfriend.

287
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,016
Ted, I love you. I love Robin.

288
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:22,065
But if you do this right now,

289
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,392
your entire future with her
will be built on a crime!

290
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:29,238
<i>Just go home, Ted.
Don't do this the wrong way!</i>

291
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:30,800
I hate how you're always right.

292

It's my best and most annoying trait.

293
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:36,014
Okay.

294
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,028

- Hey.
- Hey.

00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:54,402
I should probably get going.
It's pretty late.

297
00:14:55,534 --> 00:15:00,180
- I'm sorry. I...
- Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.

298
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,110
- Can I call you tomorrow?
- Totally.

299
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:05,837
- Totally. Call me tomorrow.
- Okay.

300
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:09,030
- Good night, Robin.
- Good night, Ted.

301
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,361
Oh, my God! We're making out.

302
00:15:39,463 --> 00:15:40,839
- Right!
- This is crazy.

303

Right! Right!

304
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:48,102
Should we go to my room?
I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...

305

- Yeah.
- Yeah?

306
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,300
Yeah.

Real quick.

308
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,348

Say, Ted, how long do you think
that conversation's gonna be?

317

Length of an average pee? No.

318
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,491
We're gonna be on the phone
for at least 20 minutes.

319
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:34,243
Robin's out there. She's gonna think
you're in here taking a massive...

320
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,435
What do you want from me?
People break up. It happens.

Not like this.

322
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:44,226
Not from the bathroom of the girl
that you're about to sleep with.

323
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:46,240

<i>OLDER TED: And so, Barney was right.</i>

339
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,122
<i>The night was legendary.</i>

340
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:44,930
<i>It would come to be known as the time
Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the nards.</i>

341
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:51,140
Hey, you guys remember that time
that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the nards?

342
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:51,282
You're right.

343
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:52,354
You're right.

344
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,658
I owe you a real breakup call.

345
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:56,162
I'll call you tomorrow.

346
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:58,785
Good. So, you're gonna go home?

347
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,697
Why should I have to go home?

348
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:04,993
You know, there's every chance
Robin's the woman I'm gonna marry.

349
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,913
- Ted.
- It could happen!

350
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:11,169
And so, really, what's it gonna matter
in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night?

351
00:18:11,265 --> 00:18:15,014
Look, I know this is a moral gray area, but...

352
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:16,896
it's Robin.

353
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:17,953
And I'm exhausted.

354
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:20,704
I am. I'm exhausted from pretending
I'm not in love with her.

355
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,112
I think that makes this okay.

356
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,927
Oh, please. You just want to get laid!

357
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:27,128
Yes, I do. You got me.

358
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,727
That is exactly what I want right now.
And so what?

359
00:18:29,823 --> 00:18:31,359
I want this. She wants this.

360
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:35,455
It's happening. And if you have a problem
with it, don't be in Germany!

361
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:37,503
It's been nice pretending to taIk to you.

362
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,941
Thanks for not calling me and good night.

363
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,228
That's not your phone.

364
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,916
This isn't my phone.

365
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:53,883
Okay. Bye.

366
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,450
I thought it was mine, so I answered it.

367
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,484
- Was it...
- It was your girlfriend.

368
00:19:02,877 --> 00:19:05,485
You might want to call her back.

369
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:29,403
<i>OLDER TED: I called Victoria from the cab,
and we broke up.</i>

370
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,067
Yes, I'm...

371
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:33,147
<i>And there you have it, kids.</i>

372
00:19:33,243 --> 00:19:36,096
<i>The stupidest thing I've ever done.</i>

373
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,835
<i>In one night, I managed to hurt
two people I cared about.</i>

374
00:19:39,931 --> 00:19:45,229
<i>And none of it would've happened
if I had just listened to my mom.</i>

375
00:19:53,434 --> 00:19:57,209
<i>So, I guess if there's a lesson
to be learned here, it's this,</i>

376
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:59,425
<i>when it's after 2:00 a.m.,</i>

377
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:01,655
<i>just go to sleep.</i>
