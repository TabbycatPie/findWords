1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,720
I lost it.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,560
Fucking hell! No!

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,200
Last year was probably
the hardest moment of my life.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
I had the Red Bull demotion.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,600
I got moved from Red Bull to Toro Rosso.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,840
<i>Alex Albon,
after just 12 races in Formula 1,</i>

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,560
<i>has now replaced Pierre Gasly at Red Bull.</i>

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,200
It was a really horrible and...
and difficult time for me to go through.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Yeah, of course, I got a lot of shit.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,080
Did you get any advance warning?

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,520
Well...

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,880
Pierre was demoted
in a very public fashion.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,240
You're surprised by
the decision. Do you believe it was fair?

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,680
In 2020,
I feel I'm a more complete driver

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,680
and probably performing
at my best level at the moment.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,120
Alongside Lewis Hamilton
and Max Verstappen,

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,240
Pierre Gasly is...

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,440
...undoubtedly
the driver of 2020 so far.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,720
I deserve to go back to Red Bull.

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,520
And that's the target, yeah, that's clear.

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,360
Is it the jacket with the trousers
or the jacket with jeans?

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,320
- Whatever.
- My jeans are good. Don't touch my jeans.

23
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,760
Okay, that's nice.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,040
I think this is gonna go great. Look.

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,280
Get this.

26
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,720
Yeah, that's right.

27
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,280
- Oh my God!
- Here he is.

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,840
Who is this wild animal?

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,400
It's actually good, the weather now.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, when the sun's out,
it's getting much hotter.

31
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,160
Yeah, but you're hot all the time, right?

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,240
- No.
- When I get close to you, you get hot.

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
No, not really. Somehow... somehow not.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
Not anymore.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,520
"Not anymore"
means at some point, it worked!

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,640
Of course, yeah.

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
AlphaTauri is the new name
for Toro Rosso.

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,600
It is a solid midfield team.

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,040
Its only reason for existing
over the past decade

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,000
was as a Formula 1 school
for Red Bull's young drivers.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,880
Pierre's confidence
since going back to AlphaTauri

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,960
has completely transformed.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
<i>Pierre Gasly closing in.
They go side by side.</i>

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,120
Fuck yes!

45
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,600
<i>Sensational for AlphaTauri.</i>

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,320
<i>Now, can Gasly keep his foot in?</i>

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,720
<i>He can, to get past the Ferrari driver.</i>

48
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,040
Yes!

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,960
Ah, yes!

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,000
<i>That feels nice.
Good job, Pierre. Amazing race.</i>

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,480
But every driver that races at AlphaTauri
doesn't see their future at AlphaTauri.

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,120
It's a team where you prove your worth
to Red Bull Racing.

53
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,040
For me, it was good to be back.

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,520
Suddenly, I understood how to drive again.

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,440
This is a bit small, no?

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,200
Of course, the car is not as competitive

57
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,120
and, as a competitive guy,
you always wanna be in the fastest car.

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,080
My goal will always be to be
in that Red Bull car in the top team.

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,480
As long as I'm competitive,
as long as I'm pushing,

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,720
opportunities will come

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,360
and... and that's just my... my spirit
and mentality at the moment.

62
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,240
<i>Welcome to Spa-Francorchamps,</i>

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,320
<i>located deep in Belgium's Ardennes Forest,</i>

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,400
<i>one of the oldest Grand Prix circuits
in the world.</i>

65
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,800
<i>On this Friday morning,
it's Free Practice one.</i>

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,520
Hello, Netflix.
I'm totally not smiling right now.

67
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,040
<i>The scene of controversy a year ago</i>

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
<i>when the Red Bull team
dropped Pierre Gasly</i>

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,520
<i>from their second seat.</i>

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,080
Yeah, exactly.

71
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,080
- Here he is.
- Morning.

72
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,320
- Morning.
- Morning.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,480
It's very tough going back to Spa.

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,360
All these memories come back.

75
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,120
But I'm not someone gives up.

76
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,560
What's the plan?

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,240
To do the interviews
and the first one is Jennie Gow from BBC.

78
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,280
- Yeah.
- We'll do it by phone.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,160
<i>Now, Pierre,</i>

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,800
<i>we all remember the events
of Spa last year.</i>

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,040
<i>Obviously, getting demoted from Red Bull.</i>

82
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,800
<i>Why is it that you are
so much more comfortable</i>

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,160
<i>in the AlphaTauri team?</i>

84
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
<i>You seem happy,</i>

85
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,200
<i>your results speak for themselves,</i>

86
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,080
<i>versus that Red Bull second seat,</i>

87
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,320
<i>which is always one that's uncomfortable,
I think, for everybody that ever takes it?</i>

88
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
I don't want to go
into too much details about that,

89
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,520
but they gave Alex the seat last year
because he had some decent results,

90
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
um, and... and hopefully, the...

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,120
um, yeah, for the... the coming years,

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,840
it's gonna be decided
on the same, uh, on the same criteria.

93
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,760
But at the end of the day,
I'm not the one deciding.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,920
I think Formula 1 is highly personal,
highly political,

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,120
so, when it comes to Pierre,
he has a massive point to prove.

96
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Unfortunately, I've just had to
have one of the dogs put down, so...

97
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Oh no!

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,960
It's horrible because
they become such a part of the family.

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,640
The mood I'm in, I tell you,
ask me about Pierre.

100
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,520
It's exactly one year ago
when Red Bull swapped the seats

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,680
between, uh, Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon.

102
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,560
Would you say it's impossible

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,840
to have, one day,
Pierre Gasly back at Red Bull?

104
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,360
He's obviously, uh, back in
and doing a good job in the AlphaTauri

105
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,120
and of course, we monitor his progress.

106
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,720
To drive for Red Bull,

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,560
this team is all about delivering.

108
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,320
Obviously, we have a lot of information
on how he's performing and developing.

109
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,600
Pierre's driven some good races this year,

110
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
but he's also shown dips as well.

111
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,200
<i>Ça va?</i>

112
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,440
Pierre wouldn't have had
the chance to be in Formula 1

113
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,440
without Red Bull.

114
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
And the reality is, when you get there,

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,400
if you can't cope
with the pressure and scrutiny,

116
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,080
you're never gonna make it
at the highest level in... in Formula 1.

117
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
I feel people
are gonna critique my shaving.

118
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,640
You know, I've got
that kind of like puberty fluffy beard.

119
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,160
- You're an aggressive shaver.
- I'm an aggressive shaver.

120
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,160
I've never been taught how to shave,

121
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,480
so, um, if anyone wants to sponsor me,
Gillette...?

122
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,160
Gillette or Nivea.

123
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,760
Nivea aftershave.

124
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,520
I would say, based on your ability
to grow a beard,

125
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,400
aim for the aftershave products

126
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,600
as opposed to the actual shaving products.

127
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,520
Last year, I was very much
a schoolkid on my first day of school.

128
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,840
How do you get in this place?

129
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,960
We're not even halfway
through the season yet,

130
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,320
and I still feel very...
very new to the sport.

131
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,080
Alex's performances
so far in 2020 have been good...

132
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,840
...but not great.

133
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,360
Everyone at Red Bull would have expected
at least a podium by now.

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,320
Right. Let's see what we've got.

135
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,400
We're working very hard
with Alex at the moment

136
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,360
to try and find
the confidence in this car that Max has.

137
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,040
The car hasn't been easy this year.

138
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,560
Arguably,
it's been a harder car than last year.

139
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,160
And he's up against Verstappen
who is just in unbelievable form.

140
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,440
<i>How's the balance, Alex?</i>

141
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,880
This car feels very nervous
into turn one.

142
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,240
It just feels like I'm sliding
from entry to exit.

143
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,000
- Like the tires are gone.
- Okay.

144
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,240
You all right?

145
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,720
Does the car seem a bit more settled?

146
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,720
It's still nervous,
but at least it's predictable.

147
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,520
Yeah.

148
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,080
He doesn't sound
very happy at all, so...

149
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,920
A year ago,
I was fast-tracked into a big team,

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,040
but it doesn't mean that I'm here to stay.

151
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,920
You know, as a Red Bull driver,

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,920
you're expected to be
getting podiums, getting wins.

153
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,200
It doesn't feel
like he's enjoying driving the car,

154
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
the balance that he's got.

155
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
Based on the car this weekend?

156
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
Yeah, he's not been comfy in it. I...

157
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,520
It's starting to be a bit of a pattern of...

158
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,240
We just need him to get the...
to hit the ground running earlier.

159
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,400
That's all it is.

160
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,400
And then everything
to just be easier for him.

161
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,720
Anyway...

162
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,960
Some of that
will be experience as well.

163
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,360
He's not far
off the podium, though.

164
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Quiet.

165
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,400
Ah, it is, yeah.

166
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,840
Coming back to Spa reminded me
of all the memories from the year before.

167
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,000
<i>The fatal accident
of Antoine Hubert happened</i>

168
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,800
<i>at the famous Eau Rouge corner
just behind us.</i>

169
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
<i>at the most dangerous event of the season</i>

170
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,120
<i>in Formula 1 and Formula 2...</i>

171
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
Last year, I got moved
from Red Bull to Toro Rosso

172
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,400
and then Anthoine passed away
that same weekend.

173
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,640
It was the hardest moment of my life.

174
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,080
He was such a... a close friend.

175
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,920
Since we were little kids.

176
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,600
We had the same life goal.

177
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,520
He wanted as much as... as I wanted
to be in Formula 1.

178
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,840
Fucking crazy, eh?

179
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,080
After I got moved from Red Bull,
Anthoine sent me a message.

180
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,160
"Prove everybody wrong and...

181
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
show them your... your skills and talent."

182
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,120
<i>It is round seven
of this Formula 1 season in 2020.</i>

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,480
Hey. How are you?

184
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,960
We nearly got
your fucking number two!

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,960
You know he's gonna be the one
on the brink to turn five.

186
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Exactly.

187
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,720
There's only two teams
in the last ten years

188
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,120
that have won World Championships
and that's Red Bull and Mercedes.

189
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,080
And I genuinely think
that we have an outside chance,

190
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,680
but we need both drivers
to maximize the opportunity from the car.

191
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,000
You all right?

192
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,960
If we could put them under pressure,
they would crack.

193
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,440
Just go aggressive.

194
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,040
The pressure is gonna be on Alex

195
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,440
and the best way he can get around that
is to get his first podium.

196
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,480
<i>Here's the starting grid.
Hamilton on pole, Bottas, Verstappen,</i>

197
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,440
<i>Daniel Ricciardo is fourth
ahead of Alex Albon in fifth.</i>

198
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,600
<i>Pierre Gasly starts 12th for AlphaTauri.</i>

199
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,960
<i>He'll have his work cut out
to get anything in this race.</i>

200
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
- How much more time?
- Race is two minutes to green.

201
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,280
<i>Okay, Pierre,
you know the target.</i>

202
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
<i>And we're racing at Spa.</i>

203
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,720
Ah, fuck's sake!

204
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,480
Lost the rear a bit.

205
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,800
- Come on!
- Come on!

206
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,320
<i>Albon getting squirrelly
coming out of turn one</i>

207
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,880
<i>and that's enabled Ocon
to get ahead of him.</i>

208
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,960
<i>Albon now fighting back
after losing that place at the start.</i>

209
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,560
<i>Let's have another go at him.</i>

210
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
<i>Get stuck in.</i>

211
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240
Go on, Alex!

212
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,680
We can barely catch them with DRS.

213
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,640
<i>Onboard with Pierre Gasly.</i>

214
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,640
<i>You know what our race is.
We go all in.</i>

215
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,120
<i>It's all about maximum attack.</i>

216
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,160
After what happened to Anthoine...

217
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,240
I need to show everybody...

218
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,720
<i>Here they come into the hairpin.</i>

219
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,480
...that I'm performing better.

220
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,480
<i>Be careful there.
You have to be careful.</i>

221
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,080
<i>Pérez is gonna be
under pressure here from Gasly.</i>

222
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,640
<i>What a move that was!
Side by side through Eau Rouge.</i>

223
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,200
That's how we race!

224
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,760
<i>What a job. That's P11.</i>

225
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,120
<i>He's got a great chance.
In fact, he's already passed the Ferrari.</i>

226
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,440
Come on, Pierre.

227
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,480
<i>We are back in business. P10.</i>

228
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,480
<i>Gasly fancies a go, doesn't he?</i>

229
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,880
<i>That's, uh, P9.</i>

230
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,320
<i>Okay, head down, Pierre, head down.
Stroll in front.</i>

231
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,600
Come on, let's get him.

232
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,840
<i>Gasly's now into eighth place.</i>

233
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
<i>Alex Albon
not really making much of an impression.</i>

234
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,760
<i>Alex,
it's the last lap now. Stay strong.</i>

235
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Yep, okay.

236
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,320
<i>Uh, gap behind
to Ocon is reducing.</i>

237
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,680
<i>Esteban Ocon,
he's got Alex Albon in his sights.</i>

238
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,040
<i>He's gonna try the move to the outside</i>

239
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,880
<i>and he gets it done.</i>

240
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,360
Oh, for fuck's sake!

241
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,160
<i>Lewis Hamilton, another win.</i>

242
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,880
<i>Mercedes one-two.</i>

243
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,960
<i>It's third place for Max Verstappen,</i>

244
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,480
<i>and Alex Albon just holds onto sixth,</i>

245
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,840
<i>losing out on yet another podium.</i>

246
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,640
<i>Just couldn't make an impact.</i>

247
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,640
<i>Gasly crosses the line
with a fine performance,</i>

248
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,240
<i>gaining four positions to eighth place
and Driver of the Day as well.</i>

249
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,520
<i>I mean,
take a bow, Pierre Gasly.</i>

250
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
<i>What a drive, Pierre.</i>

251
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Wow!

252
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,200
Fuck yeah!

253
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,400
<i>Okay, Alex,
hard luck there in the end.</i>

254
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,720
Yep.

255
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,520
It was unreal.

256
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,840
It was a shit race, though.

257
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,240
There's not much more
you could've done.

258
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,920
When things don't go well,

259
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,320
I'm my harshest critic.

260
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,600
You can't... You can't hide it.

261
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,640
It's just really tough.

262
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,560
There's no point
feeling sorry for yourself

263
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,360
and that's all there is to it.

264
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Can we do a little foot tap?

265
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,160
Driver of the Day.

266
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,360
Dude, if it wasn't for social distancing,
I'd give you a hug. What an amazing drive.

267
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,120
You mastered six moves in the end.

268
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,040
Oh yeah?
My favorite one was the one on Pérez.

269
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,080
I was like, "If he keeps going,
we're both in the wall,

270
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,520
and I'm just fucking going for it, so..."

271
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,600
It's such a strange place
for Gasly to be in.

272
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,520
It's just bonkers how well he's done.

273
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,240
He's still got a point to prove

274
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
and he still wants that Red Bull seat.

275
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,000
Pierre, what you think
this strong form might potentially mean

276
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,320
for your future career,
from you being dropped by Red Bull?

277
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,680
At the end of the day,
it's... it's not my call.

278
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,600
I've always believed
as long as you put strong performances,

279
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,120
sooner or later, opportunities will come.

280
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,560
It's great to see
our sister team, AlphaTauri, uh,

281
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,160
doing a fantastic job.

282
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,680
Good for Pierre as well.

283
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,800
Uh, he looks very comfortable
in that environment.

284
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,160
He looks... looks, uh, relaxed

285
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,200
and he's driving at the potential
that we knew he had.

286
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
<i>Obviously,
Pierre got Driver of the Day today.</i>

287
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,720
<i>Does it put him back in the frame
for a future with Red Bull?</i>

288
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,560
Pierre? Um...

289
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,600
Well, I think he's...
he's, uh, performing well at AlphaTauri,

290
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,120
but I think we're, you know,
we're happy with the way things are.

291
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
- Okay.
- Cheers, guys.

292
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,840
See you next week.

293
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
Helmut and I looked at,
you know, the information.

294
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,360
Our decisions,
they're not just made on emotion.

295
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,040
They're based on facts.

296
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,680
They're based on a huge amount of data,
a huge amount of analysis.

297
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,360
From a team point of view,

298
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,440
there's been
nobody pushing internally to say,

299
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,640
"We've gotta have Pierre back."

300
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,880
<i>Welcome along
on a Friday afternoon</i>

301
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,560
<i>in this glorious part of Italy.</i>

302
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,400
<i>It's round eight
of the Formula 1 World Championship.</i>

303
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,920
<i>Nowhere excites quite like Monza.</i>

304
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,760
<i>At the Temple of Speed,
a final farewell after 43 years,</i>

305
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,080
<i>it's time to say thank you
at the Williams family's final race.</i>

306
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,920
I told him, now he has to deal
with you at home every day.

307
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,600
Thanks!
I'll be asking you for a job.

308
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,800
Do you need a PA?

309
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Sorry!

310
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,440
Why is it, as soon
as the cameras are on, you mess up?

311
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,400
I just hope we can overtake this time.

312
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,120
- I think it's gonna be hard.
- Yeah.

313
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,720
Ready for a good day.

314
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,560
Remember what I was saying earlier,

315
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,680
if they start hammering you,
don't stand for any bollocks.

316
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,680
We're in control.

317
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,400
You've had your ups and downs,

318
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,160
but Christian and the whole team,
they've been very supportive of you,

319
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,600
publicly at least.

320
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,400
Sometimes, in sport,
you get a result that changes everything.

321
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,200
Is maybe that what you need?

322
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,760
You think you can fight
towards the podium?

323
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,840
It could be that Red Bull
genuinely believe that Alex is the one,

324
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,600
that Alex has the potential
that Pierre didn't.

325
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,920
I don't... Look, I think
Alex is a great racing driver.

326
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,360
I don't think
we've seen the best of him yet.

327
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,000
Uh, we have no interest in... in having
Pierre back, you know, this season.

328
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,040
On the other hand, it could just be that...

329
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,480
they cannot bring themselves to admit

330
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,000
that they made a mistake.

331
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Rumble time.

332
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,560
Welcome to Gas-man's <i>Carpool Karaoke</i>.

333
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,640
So, do you want the news?

334
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,320
"No 2020 Red Bull return for Gasly,"

335
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Horner said.

336
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,760
"Alex is only going to get better."

337
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,520
"He's still pretty young and inexperienced

338
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,520
and we are doing all we can
to support and develop him."

339
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,480
But seriously, it's like...

340
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,000
It's a joke.
How they treat this is a joke.

341
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,840
I have my target.

342
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,480
The fight is on.

343
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,160
And now,
we're gonna score some fucking points.

344
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,320
Sometimes, Formula 1 is not fair.

345
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,600
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.

346
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,160
I feel this is, like, extra small.

347
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,080
No, it's just pumped guns.

348
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,520
But if I get knocked,

349
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,080
I just go back at it even harder.

350
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,120
- Radio check okay?
- Radio is good.

351
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,280
<i>We go to the grid.
Please confirm.</i>

352
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,080
Copy.

353
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,600
When things piss you off,

354
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,760
me, I use this energy
to make me even stronger.

355
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,920
The situation with Alex is very clear.

356
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,880
He knows the pressure that he's under
to deliver a result.

357
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,440
He needs to get a little bit more
of that "fuck you" attitude

358
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,840
that you see the great drivers have.

359
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,960
You know, as a Red Bull driver,
you need to perform

360
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,480
to... to kind of show
the big bosses, really,

361
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,880
that you're there to be in Formula 1.

362
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,800
<i>Alex Albon starts ninth,</i>

363
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,560
<i>desperate to end this run without a podium
for the Red Bull driver.</i>

364
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,360
<i>He's alongside Pierre Gasly
in tenth place.</i>

365
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,520
<i>Ten seconds. Ten seconds.</i>

366
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,280
<i>It's lights out and away we go.</i>

367
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,360
<i>Alex Albon
and Pierre Gasly wheel to wheel.</i>

368
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,280
<i>Oh, contact!</i>

369
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,480
<i>Gasly gets past him.</i>

370
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,640
Can you check my front?
I was sandwiched.

371
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,880
<i>We are checking.</i>

372
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
<i>Alex Albon getting it
all wrong at that first chicane</i>

373
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
<i>and losing places as a result.</i>

374
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,200
I've got no grip on these hards!

375
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,080
We've got a little bit
of floor damage on the left-hand side.

376
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,160
- So, we're gonna be at the back?
<i>- We are currently P14.</i>

377
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,800
<i>Albon in
serious trouble here. He's dropped to P14.</i>

378
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,720
<i>Okay, Pierre, box, box. Box, box.</i>

379
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,880
<i>Torque one in the pitlane.
Focus on reaction time.</i>

380
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
We are good?

381
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,960
<i>We are in a good place.
You're doing a very good job.</i>

382
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,400
<i>Push, push. Push, push.</i>

383
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,440
- <i>Leclerc behind you, one second.</i>
- Copy.

384
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,720
<i>And that is a very big accident.</i>

385
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,520
Leclerc is out?

386
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,640
<i>Confirmed. He went out.</i>

387
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,040
<i>Safety car. Safety car. Safety car!</i>

388
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,720
Okay, Pierre.
They are still clearing the track.

389
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,840
Pit-lane entry is closed at the moment.
I'll keep you posted.

390
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,400
<i>The pit-lane entry
is closed, but Hamilton's coming in.</i>

391
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,800
Who pitted in front of us?

392
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,520
Only Hamilton, but the pit lane
was closed, so he should have a penalty.

393
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,040
<i>Hamilton is under investigation</i>

394
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,720
<i>for pitting when the pit-lane entry
was closed.</i>

395
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,520
<i>And now, the pit-lane entry is open.</i>

396
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,760
There will be some cars
in the pit exit. Everyone is boxing.

397
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,080
Copy.

398
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,640
<i>This is pretty good for us.
This is pretty good for us.</i>

399
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,600
Copy.

400
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,440
<i>So,
this has really changed the order round.</i>

401
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,920
<i>Pierre Gasly pitted way before,
so he's a massive gainer in this.</i>

402
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
<i>Okay, Pierre,
we just gained 20 seconds.</i>

403
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,400
- Which position are we now?
<i>- P3.</i>

404
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,640
<i>Now the red flags are out.</i>

405
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,440
<i>We're red-flagging the race.
It's basically a reset.</i>

406
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,880
<i>Incredible scenes at Monza.</i>

407
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,200
<i>Pierre Gasly
is in an unbelievable position right now.</i>

408
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,200
<i>- When you stop, go to P3.</i>
- Copy.

409
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,480
<i>Hamilton is leading,
Stroll is second, Gasly is third.</i>

410
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,360
<i>And we're getting ready
to restart the race on lap 28.</i>

411
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,600
<i>Okay, Pierre,
you know the target now.</i>

412
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,200
Yeah, it's good for us
to just fucking push and see what we get.

413
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,800
In Formula 1,
you never know what can happen.

414
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,040
There is no way
I'm gonna miss this opportunity.

415
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,040
<i>And we're racing again.
Stroll dropping back.</i>

416
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,560
<i>Gasly up to second place.</i>

417
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,600
<i>Okay, push, push. Push, push.</i>

418
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,360
<i>Lewis Hamilton
holds the lead for the time being.</i>

419
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,920
How is the rear slip and braking?

420
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,040
<i>Still all good on data, Pierre.
Still all good on data.</i>

421
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,200
<i>News from race control.</i>

422
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,320
<i>It's a ten-second stop-and-go penalty
for Lewis Hamilton.</i>

423
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
<i>And he's coming in.</i>

424
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,640
<i>Hamilton into the pit lane
from the lead of the race</i>

425
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,280
<i>to serve
his ten-second stop-and-go penalty.</i>

426
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,080
<i>Pierre Gasly leads the Italian Grand Prix.</i>

427
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,640
<i>Head down, Pierre, head down.
Keep focusing on the pace.</i>

428
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Copy.

429
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,240
<i>Gasly, Sainz and Stroll,
the one-two-three.</i>

430
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,920
<i>Sainz closing in.</i>

431
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,240
Tell me the gap behind.

432
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,920
<i>Sainz, 2.1 behind
and Stroll is two behind him.</i>

433
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,800
<i>Seven laps to go, seven laps.</i>

434
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,640
<i>How long can Gasly
keep Sainz out of DRS range?</i>

435
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,400
I don't know
if we have more power,

436
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,080
but if we have, let's use it.

437
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,520
<i>This chance might never
come around ever again for both drivers.</i>

438
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,880
<i>You don't know in Formula 1.
You've got to take your opportunities.</i>

439
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,080
Winning a Formula 1 race
was one of my dreams

440
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,400
since I started to watch F1
when I was five years old.

441
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,080
But to win a Formula 1 race,
being in a midfield car,

442
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,120
you've got to risk everything.

443
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,760
<i>Sainz is giving it everything.</i>

444
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,000
<i>Gasly is under so much pressure.</i>

445
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,160
<i>Two more laps. Two more laps.</i>

446
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,520
<i>Okay, push, push. Push, push.</i>

447
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,040
<i>Sainz is charging the battery
to prepare to attack.</i>

448
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,160
<i>We can defend.</i>

449
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,640
<i>Sainz is now within one second.</i>

450
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
<i>Last lap. One more lap.</i>

451
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,760
<i>Carlos Sainz is going to get close,</i>

452
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,640
<i>but he's not gonna get close enough.</i>

453
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,960
Come on! Come on! Come on!

454
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:41,400
<i>Pierre Gasly wins the Italian Grand Prix!</i>

455
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Oh my God!

456
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,320
What did we just do?

457
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,160
<i>- What did you do?</i>
- We won the fucking race!

458
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,840
Yes!

459
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,720
Oh my God!

460
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,160
Oh my God, guys. We did it!

461
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,240
Oh my God! Yes!

462
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,880
<i>P1, Pierre, P1!</i>

463
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,480
AlphaTauri, Honda,

464
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,840
all the engineers, all the mechanics,
everybody in Faenza,

465
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,280
thanks to you, we... we did it.

466
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
We did it!

467
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah!

468
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,240
You're as good as your last race
in this game,

469
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,760
so perceptions can change

470
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,520
very, very quickly.

471
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,840
Pierre has done an excellent job.

472
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,480
He's driving like he has nothing to lose.

473
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,520
Number one!

474
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,680
<i>Okay, so, finishing order, uh,
was Gasly, Sainz, Stroll.</i>

475
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,440
<i>We were P15.</i>

476
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,680
Okay. Sorry, guys.

477
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,640
Look...

478
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,000
...the situation with Alex is very clear.

479
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,480
That race was a disaster for him,

480
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,320
so we need to see Alex
really grab that seat and make it his own.

481
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,160
The problem is if he doesn't,

482
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,520
then, you know,
we need to look outside and think,

483
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,680
"Okay, if Alex isn't gonna
make that next step,

484
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
who do we put alongside Max for 2021?"

485
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,440
<i>Well done to Pierre Gasly!</i>

486
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,840
This is such an amazing moment.

487
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,840
A moment I dreamed about
for so many years.

488
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,120
I just thought,
"Okay, we've done it."

489
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,640
"What more do I need to prove?"

490
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,800
Oh...

491
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,560
I know, in life,
you... you have many obstacles.

492
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,600
After the Red Bull demotion,

493
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,520
I had to face a big challenge.

494
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,680
I had to rebuild myself.

495
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,560
But it's only my third season in F1,
so I'm better than last year.

496
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,440
2021 is gonna be a better Pierre,

497
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,560
and 2022 is gonna be
an even better Pierre.

498
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,240
Ready to give my very best...

499
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,080
...to bring this team
as much success as I can.

500
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,720
Let me get this done,
then you can go.

501
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
I need to call my parents as well.

502
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,880
Have you heard them? Fuck,
I cannot imagine how they are right now.

503
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
What the fuck?

504
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,040
The target for the season is to survive
as a team.

505
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,280
- It's a very expensive business.
- Couldn't even do one lap!

506
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,120

00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,320
The German sponsors want German drivers.

00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,160
He needs to step it up.

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,040
If he doesn't, there are gonna be
some difficult decisions to be made.

511
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,000
It's incredibly hard.

512
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,920
He doesn't want to leave Formula 1.
