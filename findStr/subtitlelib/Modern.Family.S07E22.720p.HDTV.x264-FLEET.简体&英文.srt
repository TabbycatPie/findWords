00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,710
克莱尔  卢克床上有个女孩
Claire. There's a girl in Luke's bed.

40
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,410
卢克在哪儿
Where's Luke?

41
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,800
跟女孩在一起啊
With the girl!

42
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,380
我们该制造点噪音把她吓走吗
Should we just make a noise and scare her off?

43
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,390
是女孩还是负鼠
Is it a girl or a possum?

44
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,100
亲爱的  根本没人
Honey, there's no one there.

45
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,210
刚刚有的  我看到了一个女孩  还有头发
There was. I saw girl bumps and hair.

46
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,460
可能只是他的丘巴卡娃娃
It was probably just his Chewbacca doll.

47
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,700
不是娃娃  那是个毛绒动作玩偶
It's not a doll. It's a plush action figure.

48
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,540
只要他还跟那玩意儿一起睡
Well, as long as he's sleeping with that thing,

49
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,180
它就只会有陪睡这个动作
it's the only action he's gettin'.

50
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,930
我真是松了口气  我还没准备好他那样呢
I'm so relieved. I wasn't ready for that.

51
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,190
你以为你看到了根本不存在的东西
You thought you saw something that wasn't there.

52
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,260
很黑  我们还一起喝了一整瓶酒
It's dark, and we shared an entire bottle of wine.

53
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,850
确实黑
It is dark.

54
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,390
我都没看到你说"一起"时那种开玩笑的样子
I didn't see you do air quotes around "shared".

55
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,460
好吧  这些合同都没问题了
All right. These contracts are good to go.

56
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,270
只剩下检查了
All that's left is the inspection.

57
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,360
已经安排好了
Already scheduled it.

58
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,370
安迪  如果我能把你塞进一瓶古龙水里
Andy, if I could bottle you up

59
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,490
然后封起来  你知道我会把你命名为什么吗
and put you into a cologne, you know what I'd call it?

60
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,780
进取号
"Initiative."

61
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,950
黑白广告
The black-and-white commercial

62
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,620
会让模特都变成黑豹
would have models turning into panthers.

63
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,320
进取号  来自加州的中性香水
"Initiative -- a unisex fragrance from California."

64
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,310
尽管我想继续跟你打趣
I want to come back to this because it's fun,

65
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,290
但我需要你的建议
but I need your advice.

66
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,050
你还记得我在犹他州的堂兄吗
You remember my cousin back in Utah,

67
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,630
-那个房地产开发商  -记得啊
- the real-estate developer? - Yeah.

68
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,360
他的副总要辞职
Well, turns out his V.P.'s leaving

69
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,340
去自己开公司了
to start his own company,

70
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,040
然后我堂兄需要人接替他  现在就要...
and my cousin needs someone, like -- like, now.

71
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,340
那是个很不错的机...
That's a big opp-- 

72
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,740
你怎么回来了
What are you doing home?

73
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,500
你开玩笑吗  放假了啊  我回家过暑假啊
Are you serious? School's out. I'm home for the summer.

74
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,210
你知道的
You knew this.

75
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,510
我一定是走神了  我好开心你回来了
Must have slipped my mind. I'm so glad you're back.

76
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,320
就这样了吗
That's it?

77
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,630
桑杰的父母给他搞了个
Sanjay's parents are throwing him

78
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,030
三天的"欢迎回家"派对
a three-day "Welcome Home" party.

79
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,250
他们甚至用金盏花给他做了一套西服
They even made him a suit out of marigolds.

80
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,960
真是惊喜啊  小宝贝
This is a nice surprise, pumpkin.

81
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,130
是我在日历上
Was I too subtle with the way 

82
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,880
{\an8}艾娘娘回宫啦  接驾

83
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,880
写得还不明显  还是...
I put it on the calendar, or...

84
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,200
某人起床心情很好哟
Someone woke up in a good mood.

85
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,760
一个少年会这样子
And there is only one reason

86
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,440
只有一个原因
a teenage boy is ever like that.

87
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
是啊  因为今天是家庭露营训练日
Yep, because it's Family Camp training day!

88
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,240
我本来想说
Oh, I was gonna say,

89
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,090
一定是哈林篮球队来了
"The Harlem Globetrotters must be in town."

90
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,240
卢克和我正在为很重要家庭十项全能做训练
Luke and I are training for the big...Famcathlon.

91
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,890
你吃得...真不少啊
You're, uh, carb-loading.

92
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,450
好主意  哥们
Good idea, buddy!

93
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,650
挺饿[饥渴]呀
Hungry dude.

94
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,380
渴望家庭露营
Hungry for Family Camp!

95
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,470
别马上拒绝我  快想象一下我打扮成这样
Don't say "No" right away, but picture me with these.

96
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,210
亲爱的  你才八岁  你的身体还需要时间成长
Sweetie, you're 8 years old. Give your body time to develop.

97
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,170
这卷发  我想要烫头发
These curls! I want a perm!

98
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,790
你去看看你的同龄人
Take it from someone 

99
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,350
谁有烫头发的  你找不到的
who had a perm at your age -- you don't.

100
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,920
好了  你觉得我穿这身儿上飞机怎么样
Okay, what do you think of my airplane outfit?

101
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,510
我降落在密苏里的时候  我想马上融入其中
When I land in Missouri, I want to blend right in.

102
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,330
融入什么  坛罐乐队吗
With what? A jug band?

103
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,520
我今年夏天找到了一份工作
I got a job this summer

104
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,400
去密苏里州橄榄球队
as an assistant defensive coordinator

105
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,830
当助理防守教练
for the Missouri State football team.

106
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,740
我要回家啦
Go, Bears! I'm going home.

107
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,830
我最近工作又非常忙  这意味着
And I have been crazy with work, which means

108
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,370
莉莉得在我们俩之间来回跑
Lily will be going back and forth between the two of us.

109
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,590
不过我们俩在商量
It has been a little tense

110
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,310
时间安排的时候  有点小紧张
putting together a time-share agreement, though.

111
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,480
我可没有故意制造紧张
I haven't been making it tense.

112
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,580
是你把我们女儿
You're the one who treats our daughter

113
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,540
当成个阿鲁巴的度假房产似的
like she's a vacation property in Aruba.

114
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,460
也许应该提拔你做个超强防守[爱还口的]教练
Maybe you should be promoted to very defensive coordinator.

115
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,570
-给你  -你打出了
- There you go. - Okay, you typed up

116
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,510
我们要怎么分享我们的女儿
how we're gonna share our daughter.

117
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,320
这是什么  监护协议吗 
What is this -- some sort of custody agreement?

118
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,630
我起草了一份文件
I just drafted a document

119
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,640
内容大致是我们昨晚商量的东西
that reflects what we discussed last night.

120
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,100
你老是忘记你同意了的事情啊  小卡
You have a tendency to forget about things you agreed to, Cam.

121
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,070
那真是胡说八道
Okay, that's a bunch of hooey.

122
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,140
里奇  我忘记拿毛巾了  说明不了什么
Rich! I forgot to bring up the towels. That proves nothing.

123
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,810
我本不想打扰你  但我去法庭快迟到了
I wouldn't bother you, but I'm late for court.

124
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,190
非常清楚直白
It's really very straightforward.

125
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,770
如果密苏里连下超过三天的雨
If it rains for more than three days in Missouri,

126
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,290
我的时间就抵掉一些
that borrows against my time.

127
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,460
相反  如果莉莉去了体操营
Conversely, if Lily does go to gymnastics camp,

128
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,430
就要多给我一周
I get an extra week.

129
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,600
太难懂了
It's too confusing.

130
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,700
等等  你是律师  对吧
Wait -- You're a lawyer, right?

131
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,020
我能请你帮我看个东西吗
Can I actually have you take a peek at something for me?

132
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
你要干什么
W-What are you doing?

133
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,250
我在请律师呢
I'm lawyering up.

134
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,960
是啊
uh, yeah.

135
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,100
这份合同里有太多模糊用语了
There's a lot of ambiguous language in this contract.

136
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,120
我要是你就不会签的
I wouldn't sign it.

137
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,610
没人让他签啊
Nobody's asking him to.

138
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,030
我永远不会同意放弃国庆日那天陪莉莉的
You know, I never would have agreed to give up 4th of July,

139
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,720
现在我都担心
and now I'm worried

140
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,900
他在骗我放弃在好运饼干日那天陪莉莉的权力
he's trying to trick me out of Biscuit Bonanza.

141
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,250
好运饼干日
B-Biscuit Bonanza?

142
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,130
就是你听到的这样
It's what it sounds like.

143
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,490
是一个饼干烘焙比赛
It's a biscuit-baking competition,

144
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,950
比看看谁能把自己的饼干扔得最远
and then you see who can throw theirs the furthest.

145
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,190
我能展示一下证据A吗
May I present Exhibit "A"?

146
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,230
没关系  米奇尔  我才不在意国庆日
That's fine, Mitchell -- I don't care about 4th of July,

147
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,100
只要我能带莉莉参加好运饼干日
as long as I get Lily for Biscuit Bonanza.

148
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,340
好运饼干
Biscuit Bonanza?!

149
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,640
对  就是你听到的这样  是一个饼干烘焙...
Yeah. It's what it sounds like. It's a biscuit-baking --

150
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,780
算了  我从来没这么讨厌过我的声音
Okay, I have never hated the sound of my own voice more.

151
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,230
好  我要去挑衣服了
Okay. I'm gonna go pick up that costume.

152
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,810
什么  衣服  天呐  小卡
What costume? Oh, my God, Cam.

153
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,950
别忘了和胡娇吃早午餐
Don't forget about Pepper's brunch.

154
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,410
好  够了
Okay, stop it!

155
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,640
今天不是你第一天回去和克莱尔工作吗
Isn't it your first day back working with Claire?

156
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,450
我得先把这封邮件
I got to get this e-mail out first

157
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:11,230
发到那家搞错我订单的店里去
to a store that got my order wrong.

158
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,210
我看着像那种
Do I look like a guy

159
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,490
会穿一件全是菠萝的衬衫的家伙吗
who would wear a shirt with pineapples all over it?

160
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,330
有点
Kinda.

161
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,970
我想全用大写字母来显示我有多么生气
I want to use all caps to get across how angry I am,

162
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,020
但是输入每个字目前都按一次"Shift"键实在太慢了
but it takes forever to press "Shift" before each letter.

163
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,920
你为什么直接锁定大写
Why don't you just put on the caps lock?

164
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,840
可以这样吗
You can do that?

165
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,190
杰
Oh, Jay.

166
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,700
双击这里
Just double-click here.

167
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,340
不管用
Didn't work.

168
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,880
那是因为你没有双击
Well, that's because you didn't double-click.

169
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,610
你只是点击了两次
You just clicked twice.

170
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,780
有什么区别吗
The hell's the difference?

171
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,700
双击  看到没
Double-click. See?

172
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,980
我就是这样啊
That's exactly what I did.

173
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,220
双...击
Double...click.

174
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,800
不对  你只是点击了两次
No, you're still just clicking twice.

175
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,680
听我说  双击
Listen to me -- "Double-click."

176
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,560
不是  双...击
Not "Double...click."

177
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,790
我不是傻子
I'm not an idiot.

178
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,200
双击
Double-click!

179
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,290
这怎么可能是一样的
You can't possibly think that's the same thing!

180
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,600
那就是完全一样的
It's the exact same thing!

181
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,480
双击
Double-click!

182
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,490
双击
Double-click!

183
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,580
我...
Oh, what the...

184
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,990
这是我第一次说那个艹字头的字
It's the first time I've ever used the F-word.

185
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,340
发生什么事了
Ay, what's going on here?

186
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,280
连我都觉得你们在尖叫
Even for me, it's a little screamy!

187
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
我要去工作了
I'm going to work! Wh--

188
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,170
你怎么把他惹生气了
Why did you get him so mad?

189
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,010
我需要他有个好心情
I need him in a good mood.

190
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,870
我还得叫他下周跟我
I need to ask him to go with me next week

191
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,810
去华雷斯参加我表弟的婚礼呢
to Juárez to my cousin's wedding.

192
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,660
那里安全吗
Is that safe?

193
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,370
当然不
Of course not.

194
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,160
邀请函上写着  请快速跑到接待处
The invitation says "Short run to the reception".

195
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,040
万一泊车小弟因为我手短
What are the odds the valet slid the seat back

196
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,870
故意把椅子往后调怎么办
because of my weirdly short arms?

197
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:20,760
该死  我得接这个电话
Shoot. I should take this.

198
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,770
那钱包就给我了
Then I... should take this.

199
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,290
埃文
Evan.

200
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,240
我知道你为什么打给我
Look, I know why you're calling,

201
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,950
不  我没有改变主意
and no, I haven't changed my mind.

202
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,650
我不想接受这份工作
I still don't want the job.

203
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,260
所以你拒绝这么好的机会
So, you're turning down a chance

204
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,350
不肯回家乡接受这么棒一份工作
to move home for your dream job --

205
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,060
不愿开始自己的事业  就因为一个女的吗
an actual career -- all because of a girl?

206
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,790
这个叫海莉的一定很特别
This Haley must be something special.

207
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,730
喂
Hello?

208
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,260
信号好像断了
I think I lost you.

209
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,790
喂  埃文
Hello? Evan?

210
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,810
我挂了  回头再给他打
Dropped call. I'll try him back.

211
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,930
我就知道会这样
I knew it!

212
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,830
谢谢
Thanks. 

213
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,850
欢迎回来  杰
Good to have you back, Jay!

214
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,430
回来真好  哥们儿
Good to be back, buddy.

215
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,900
公司沟通小技巧
Little trick of the trade --

216
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,930
当你不记得某人名字的时候  就叫他哥们儿
when you don't know somebody's name, you call 'em "Buddy".

217
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,330
办公室还是老样子
So, the old office, huh?

218
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,710
你把灯放到那边去了
I see you got the lamp over there now.

219
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,020
我这么做过一次
I tried it there once.

220
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,170
你会知道结果的
You'll see.

221
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,400
你的办公室下午就能收拾好
Your office is gonna be ready this afternoon.

222
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,230
你要去拿新的...
Do you want to go pick up your new --

223
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,370
所以现在在忙什么  季度报告吗
So, what are we working on? Quarterly reports?

224
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,170
其实不是  这是人事文件
Actually, no. This is a personnel file.

225
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,830
我今天得炒了尼尔
I have to fire Neal today.

226
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,480
-尼尔  -对  尼尔
- Neal? - Yeah -- Neal.

227
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,050
在库房工作  喜欢加拿大那个胖乎乎的家伙
Works in the warehouse, loves Canada, heavyset fella.

228
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,240
你是说大哥们儿啊
Oh, you mean "Big Buddy".

229
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,140
他犯错造成的损失比我们靠他赚的还多
We are losing more in shipping screw-ups than he makes.

230
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,840
是时候了
It's time.

231
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,580
-你现在就要去吗  -不是
- You gonna do that now? - Oh. No.

232
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,810
其实我现在要去复印
Um, actually, right now, I was going to make copies

233
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,260
今天下午员工会议的安排
of the agenda for this afternoon's staff meeting.

234
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,720
我来吧  你要多少份
Let me do it. How many do you need?

235
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,990
12份双面打印
Uh, 12 double-sided --

236
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,870
爸  你确定要去吗
Dad, are you sure?

237
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,590
你知道复印室在哪吗
Do you even know where the copy room is?

238
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,550
克莱尔  拜托  这地方就是我建的
Claire. Please. I built this place.

239
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,530
好吧
Okay.

240
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,270
另一边
Other way.

241
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,470
-你好  杰  -晚点再说  哥们儿
- Hi, Jay. - Not now, buddy!

242
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
"哥们儿"策略对我爸可能有用
That "Buddy" stuff may have worked for my dad,

243
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,420
但我想要建立一种更私人的联系
but I wanted a more personal touch when I took over.

244
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,210
我希望大家能够开心地工作
I wanted this to be a fun place to work,

245
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,880
所以我在库房安了一台跳舞机
so I had an arcade dance game installed in the warehouse.

246
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,850
我觉得你稍微给他们一点甜头
I figure you give them a little sugar,

247
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,910
能够减轻炒掉人的消极影响
takes the edge off when you have to fire someone like...

248
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,760
发生什么事了
What is going on?

249
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,190
尼尔简直是为跳舞机而生的
Dude, Neal is tearing it up on this dance machine.

250
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,460
你看他的分数
Check out his score.

251
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,530
他动作相当快
He's pretty quick on that thing.

252
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,920
别担心  克莱尔
Oh, don't worry, Claire.

253
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,120
他肯定不可能打破你的记录
He's never gonna beat your record.

254
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,920
你的记录已经保持几个月了  无人能及
You've had that for months. No one's even come close.

255
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,940
我一点都不担心那个
Oh, I'm not worried about that.

256
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,770
好吧  戒备心别这么强嘛
Okay. God. Don't be defensive.

257
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,750
新纪录
New high score!

258
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,570
我成功了
I did it!

259
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,040
新纪录
New high score!

260
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,300
抱歉  克莱尔
Uh, s-sorry, Claire.

261
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,970
我可不想当破了老板记录的人
Yikes. I would not want to be the guy who just beat the boss.

262
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,510
我挺喜欢这份工作的
I actually like my job.

263
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,390
能帮我拉一下拉链吗
Hey, can I get a zip?

264
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
我要买这件
I'm gonna take it.

265
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,260
胡娇的派对很有趣却也令人费解
Pepper's parties are as fun as they are confusing.

266
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,750
仔细听我接下来说的
Okay, stay with me on this one.

267
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,560
百老汇性别错乱早午餐
Gender Blender Broadway Brunch.

268
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,080
你化妆成跟自己性别相反的百老汇角色
You dress as a Broadway character of the opposite sex,

269
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,750
而且派对不提供固体食物
and there's no solid food.

270
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,020
对于下巴脱臼的
It's a perfect party 

271
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,740
舞会皇后来说这个派对十分完美
if you're a show queen with a broken jaw.

272
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,540
不好意思
Uh, excuse me.

273
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,890
抱歉  普里契特先生  你的卡刷不了
Sorry, Mr. Pritchett. Your card has been declined.

274
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,000
不可能吧
Oh, no, that's impossible.

275
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,510
不  我试了三次了
No, I ran it, like, three times.

276
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,380
我貌似应该把卡剪掉
I think I'm supposed to cut it.

277
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,410
不要剪  我车里有现金
Oh, no, no! Don't cut it! I have some cash in the car.

278
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,960
你能帮我拉开拉链吗  好像卡住了
Can you just unzip me? I think it's stuck.

279
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,240
是卡住了  你要我剪开它吗
Oh, it is stuck. You want me to cut it?

280
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,230
不要  不要剪
No, no! Don't cut it!

281
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,530
天呐  你怎么那么想剪东西
God. You really want to cut something.

282
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,630
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

283
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,380
该死
Oh, damn it!

284
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,050
不好意思  跟你合影多少钱
Excuse me. How much for a picture?

285
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,870
我其实不是...
Oh, I'm actually not --

286
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,560
拜托了  我们女儿超爱"红发安妮"
Please. Our daughter loves "Annie".

287
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,930
好吧
Well, uh...

288
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,830
我收大概20刀吧
actually, I-I could use, like, $20.

289
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,410
20刀  金刚狼才收10刀
$20? Wolverine was $10.

290
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,900
我不想跟你吵  我只是需要...
Look, I don't want to fight. I just -- I just need --

291
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,880
喂  你砸场子呢
Hey, man. What the hell?

292
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,340
不是吧
No, no, no!

293
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,290
想让杰按我的想法做事很不容易
It's not easy to get Jay to do what I want,

294
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,020
所以有时候我得用上我的秘密武器
so sometimes I have to use my secret weapon.

295
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,900
不过当我懒得用秘密武器的时候
But when I'm too tired for that,

296
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,140
我会给他放催泪电影
I just play one of the movies that make him cry like a baby.

297
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,040
这是《追梦赤子心》吗
Is this "Rudy"?

298
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,800
我超爱这电影
Oh, I love this movie.

299
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,880
是吗
You do?

300
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,410
杰  我买了两张芭蕾舞的票
Jay, I got us tickets to the ballet,

301
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,540
可是我知道你周日要去打高尔夫
but I know that you're golfing on Sunday.

302
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,290
我都听你的
Whatever you want.

303
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,600
鲁迪虽然是个小人物
You know, Rudy was small,

304
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,140
他的心胸却很宽广
but he had a big heart.

305
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,480
乔  这些卡通都是什么
Joe, what are all these cartoons?

306
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,940
妈咪的电影都没有了
Now all of Mommy's movies are gone!

307
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,250
是曼尼做的
Manny did it.

308
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,470
我照顾这小家伙的时候该怎么做
What am I supposed to do when I babysit this guy?

309
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,340
跟他说话吗
Make conversation?

310
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,960
这孩子只会讲两个故事
The kid has two stories.

311
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,470
看  我是一棵树
Look. I'm a tree.

312
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,950
这还算是比较好的故事
That's the good one.

313
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,100
{\an8}普里契特橱柜公司

314
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,360
妈  你为什么不回我电话
Mom, why aren't you calling me back?

315
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,100
我在你公司  我有话跟你说
I'm at your work. I need to talk.

316
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,020
不好意思  你见到克莱尔了吗
Uh, excuse me. Have you seen Claire?

317
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,860
有人说她在下面
Someone said she was down here.

318
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,170
没有
Uh, nope.

319
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,710
我炒不了尼尔
I couldn't fire Neal.

320
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,070
人家会觉得我炒他
It would look like I was only doing it

321
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,450
都是因为他破了我的记录
to get back at him for beating my record.

322
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,160
游戏结束
Game over!

323
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,340
所以我别无选择  必须先破了尼尔的记录
So I had no choice -- I had to beat Neal's score.

324
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,410
喂
Hello?

325
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,530
复印机要怎么用啊
How do you work a copy machine?

326
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,700
你不是吧
You can't be serious.

327
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,070
我需要双面复印12份文件
I need to make 12 double-sided copies.

328
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,360
这是个不可能完成的任务
It's an impossible task.

329
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,960
你就不能找个人帮忙吗
Can't you just ask someone for help?

330
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,460
我大张旗鼓地回来上班
I made a big deal out of coming back here to work.

331
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,310
得表现出自己有用
I'd like to appear useful.

332
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,310
等等  屏幕上有个感叹号
Wait -- On the screen, there's an exclamation mark.

333
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:43,960
是不是好兆头
Is that good?

334
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,590
它应该不是因为当前状况而激动
I don't think it means it's excited about what's happening.

335
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,070
你有把原件放到托盘里吗
Did you put the original in the tray?

336
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,310
托盘  像上菜的托盘那种吗
Tray? You mean like a serving tray?

337
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,140
对的  杰  把纸放到上菜的托盘里
Yes, Jay. I want you to put papers in a serving tray.

338
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,630
你是怎么苟活至今的
How have you remained alive?

339
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,630
我找到了
I found it!

340
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,310
好  好
Yeah! Yeah!

341
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,050
简直了  卡纸了
Great! It's stuck!

342
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,840
没关系  千万别硬拉...
That's okay. Whatever you do, don't pull the --

343
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,090
等等  我把纸拉出来
Hold on. I'm pulling it.

344
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,330
不
No!

345
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,000
有了  新最高分  终于
Yes! New high score! Finally!

346
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,430
饿了吗
Are you hungry?

347
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,930
怎么了  又是惠特尼·休斯顿诞辰吗
What's wrong? Is it Whitney Houston's birthday again?

348
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,810
不是  亲爱的  我只是因为
No, honey, I'm just sad about 

349
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,230
要离开你那么久而伤心
being away from you for so long.

350
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:26,370
我们还能在一起度过六小时
We still have six hours together.

351
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,050
咱们来过特别的一天吧
Let's have a special day!

352
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,770
肯定很有意思
Oh, that would be fun.

353
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,710
我们可以去骑车或者野餐
We could take a bike ride or have a picnic.

354
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,490
我在想更持久的东西
I was thinking something a little more permanent.

355
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,090
好了  准备接橘子
Okay. Prepare to receive.

356
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,000
记住  关键就在靠在一起的力量
And remember, it's all about the strength of the nestle.

357
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,630
他脖子上有很小但清晰可见的红印
A tiny but noticeable red mark on his neck?

358
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,450
我不傻
I'm not an idiot.

359
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,760
某人一直在自己练接橘子
Someone's been practicing his orange grip.

360
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,580
跟上脚步
Pick up the pace!

361
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,570
我们要靠这个弥补
This is where we make up

362
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,570
你妈妈在呼啦圈的劣势
for your mom being so bad at Hula-Hooping.

363
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,350
走你
Shoot!

364
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,310
我在卢克的窗子下偶然发现了这个
I randomly found this in a bush under Luke's window.

365
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,130
可能是艾丽克斯找海莉借来穿
Alex probably asked Haley to borrow them,

366
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:02,950
海莉扔了这双鞋
Haley threw the pair,

367
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,780
艾丽克斯接到一只
Alex caught one,

368
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,940
另一只从窗户飞了出来
the other one flew out the window,

369
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,130
电话响了  她们就忘了  女孩子啊
phone call came, they forgot. Girls.

370
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,270
你在家干什么
What are you doing home?

371
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,540
接受家人一次又一次的打击
Being crushed over and over by family members.

372
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,900
收到你短信了
Got your message.

373
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,100
我知道你的意思可能不是"马上来"
I know you probably didn't mean "Come over right away,"

374
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,640
不过你知道我挺偏执的  所以
but you know how paranoidy I can be, so...

375
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,720
去我屋里谈吧
We should talk in my room.

376
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,350
好的
O...kay.

377
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,530
安迪  等等
Andy. Hold on a sec.

378
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,220
我知道我们刚才没谈完
I know we didn't get to finish our talk earlier,

379
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,340
因为艾丽克斯忽然出现
because of Alex's surprise pop-in.

380
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,850
听着
Listen.

381
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,080
如果你不接受犹他州的那份工作是因为我
If you're not taking that job in Utah because of me,

382
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,690
那你就错了
you're making a mistake.

383
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,820
我喜欢咱们在一起  但如果你因为我
I love you and me together, but it would break my heart

384
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,830
放弃这个梦想的职位
if I was the reason 

385
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,660
我会很伤心的
you gave up this dream career opportunity,

386
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,290
因为  说实话
because, honestly,

387
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,240
我不知道这里有多少未来
I don't know how much of a future there is here.

388
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,060
不过
But...

389
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,960
如果我们的联系真有我想的那么紧密
if our bond is as strong as we think it is...

390
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,420
我们会想办法回到对方身边的
we'll work our way back to each other.

391
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,290
好的
Okay.

392
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,000
他说的就是我想说的
What he said.

393
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,030
你们聊什么呢
Hey, what's all the buzz about?

394
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,250
终于有人超过尼尔无法超越的...
Somebody finally top Neal's untoppable --

395
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,400
怎么回事
What happened?

396
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,110
有人把跳舞机电源拔了
Someone unplugged the dance machine.

397
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,050
所以我的最高分没了
So my high score's gone?

398
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,410
是尼尔的最高分吧
Don't you mean Neal's high score?

399
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,500
不是  我得了805分  大概20分钟前
No! I got an 805, like, 20 minutes ago!

400
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,910
不是吧
Oh, come on!

401
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,070
你们不会认为我有那么生气
Y-You can't think that I'm really so upset

402
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:24,880
真的把...
that I would actually --

403
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,450
天呐  克莱尔
Damn, Claire. 

404
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,220
你没必要这样阴人家吧
You didn't have to go all "Black Swan" on the guy.

405
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,620
我们难道就这么不信任她吗
Are we really not believing this woman?

406
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,850
她始终对我们很坦诚
She's never been anything but honest with us.

407
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,080
我搞砸事情的时候  她都会告诉我
When I screw up, she lets me know it,

408
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,560
用很体贴的方式
but in a caring way.

409
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,920
对你也是  本纳德  汤姆
Same with you, Bernard...Tom.

410
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,890
马利  你懂的
Marie, you know it.

411
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,410
我们应该感谢她
It's time we started appreciating this lady.

412
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,280
她可能在跳舞游戏上得了800分
She may have gotten an 800 on the dance game,

413
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,580
如果你们问我的话
but if you ask me,

414
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,390
她在当老板游戏里得了1000分
she gets a 1,000 on the boss game.

415
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,090
好吧
Okeydoke.

416
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,990
衣服拿了吗
Did you get the costumes?

417
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,830
差点拿不了  信用卡没法刷
Barely. My credit card was denied,

418
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,750
某人又把车里所有现金花光了
and someone spent all the cash we had in the car.

419
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,840
对  都是我的错  我道歉
Uh, yeah. Those are probably both on me. I-I apologize.

420
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,020
咱们把我今天做的所有事抛到脑后吧
Let's maybe just forgive everything I've done today.

421
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,260
"所有事"  什么意思
"Everything"? What does that mean?

422
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,530
就是这个意思
It means this!

423
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,100
我的天
Ohhh, my God!

424
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,600
我只是想在走之前给她一份特别的礼物
I just wanted to give her a special treat before I left.

425
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,610
咱们不是说好要等她再大点吗
I thought we were gonna wait until she was older.

426
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,340
我是不是该把这个也写到协议里
Did I have to put that in writing, too?

427
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,120
我能不能告他  我想告他
Can I sue him? I want to sue him.

428
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,730
你们都有充分的理由生我气
You both have every right to be upset with me.

429
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,010
也许离开我几周是件好事
And maybe a few weeks away from me will do some good.

430
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,580
我打车去机场
I'm just gonna get a cab to the airport.

431
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,870
别小家子气了  我们开车送你去
Don't be crazy. We'll drive you.

432
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,590
不用了  我受不了在大庭广众下伤感的告别
No, I don't think I can handle a public emotional goodbye!

433
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,480
还记得这个可人儿吗
Remember her?

434
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,300
我去
Damn it!

435
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,370
爸
Dad?

436
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,970
日程表在我这  克莱尔
Of course I have the agendas, Claire.

437
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,460
我只是想  证明一点
I was just... trying to prove a point.

438
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,380
我是说  那些日程表有什么用
I mean, what do you need those things for, anyway?

439
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,940
日程表  就像拐棍  弱者才用
Agendas -- they're crutches. They're for the weak.

440
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,920
你以为开国元老会用这种东西吗
You think the founding fathers wrote down an agenda?

441
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,930
说的不就是独立宣...
Well, isn't the Declaration of Inde--

442
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,100
领导人就该领导  不是读稿
A leader leads, not reads.

443
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,130
拿着一叠日程表去开会
You go into that meeting with a bunch of agendas,

444
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,300
就是在寻求他们的认同
you're asking for their approval.

445
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,540
喜欢我吧  喜欢我吧  喜欢我吧
"Like me! Like me! Like me!"

446
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,550
我就不喜欢
I say "No"!

447
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,830
我跟你说过多少次
How many times have I told you --

448
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,630
当好老板的第一条规则就是
the first rule of being a good boss is

449
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,570
不要让员工成为你的朋友
"You don't need your employees to be your friends."

450
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,420
要让他们尊重你
You need them to respect you!

451
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,910
谢谢
Thank you.

452
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,950
我需要听的正是这些话
That is...exactly what I needed to hear.

453
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,250
-分内之事而已  -对
- I'm just doing my job. - Yeah.

454
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,190
相信自己  孩子
Just trust your gut, kid.

455
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,990
双击
Double-click...

456
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,640
自己
on...yourself.

457
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,010
什么这么香
What smells so good?

458
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,850
为我自己的"欢迎回家"大餐
I'm making my favorite lasagna

459
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,650
做我最喜欢的意大利千层面
for my own "Welcome Home" dinner.

460
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,680
能不能问你个事
Can I ask you a question?

461
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,150
-什么事  -你觉得你弟
- What? - Do you think it's possible

462
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,260
有没有可能在昨晚偷偷带女孩子回家
that your brother snuck a girl in here last night?

463
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,800
我不会那么惊讶
I wouldn't be too surprised.

464
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,740
所以你觉得他  他们已经
So you think he's -- t-that they've been --

465
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,820
得了吧  爸  别那么天真
Oh, come on, Dad. Don't be so naive.

466
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,330
谁都有过十七年华
We were all 17 once.

467
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,890
说得好像谁还是...
It's not like we all --

468
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,160
我在那坐了有20分钟
I sat there like that for 20 minutes.

469
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,860
然后又听到了更可怕的消息
And then I got some more awful news.

470
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,050
我刚收到邮件说家庭露营活动取消了
I just got an e-mail saying Family Camp was canceled --

471
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,570
报名人数不够
not enough sign-ups.

472
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,790
就这样吗
That's it?

473
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,370
你一点都不关心  是不是
You don't care at all, do you?

474
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,870
忙着跟昨晚那个姑娘缠缠绵绵
You're too busy running around with that girl from last night!

475
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,470
对  没错  我什么都知道
Yeah! That's right! I know everything!

476
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,310
你怎么能这样呢  卢克
How could you, Luke?

477
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,630
其实我不知道自己为什么这么生气
To be honest, I don't know why I was so upset.

478
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,240
我知道我是该生气
I knew I was supposed to be mad, 

479
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,520
但我说不出具体原因
but I couldn't figure out why,

480
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,740
所以我只能照套路先说他几句
so I just started saying a bunch of stuff.

481
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,030
就在我家
Under my roof?!

482
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,050
这句好诡异
That was weird.

483
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,780
在我付钱买的床上
In a bed that I paid for?!

484
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,150
说这话意义何在
What does that have to do with anything?

485
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,680
就在你爷爷的眼皮底下
With your grandfather watching?!

486
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,580
意义何在
What?

487
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,320
但这都远不够我真正想说的那么夸张
But it wasn't half as crazy as what I really wanted to yell,

488
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,050
那就是  "别再长大了"
which was "Just stop growing up!"

489
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,580
听着  我不保证我现在说的全部有道理
Look, I'm not sure everything I said here makes sense,

490
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,260
但是你真得谨慎点  有点敬畏心
but...just be careful and respectful.

491
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,340
而且你的确犯了一个大错
And you did break a big rule,

492
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,000
罚你一个月不准用家里的车
so no car privileges for a month.

493
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,290
我也用不着车了
I don't need it anyway.

494
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,820
我被人甩了
I just got dumped.

495
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,260
我们就那样在那里坐了20分钟
We sat there like that for 20 minutes.

496
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,600
第一天上班怎么样
How was your first day at work?

497
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,380
有点小困难
It was a little rough, 

498
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,370
但我好像也惹了点麻烦
but I kind of stumbled into something.

499
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,710
妈咪你不是要问他吗
Aren't you going to ask him, Mommy?

500
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,540
他在说什么
What's he talking about?

501
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,410
没什么
Nothing.

502
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,040
我本来想叫你下礼拜陪我去华雷斯
I was going to ask you to go to Juárez with me

503
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
参加我表亲婚礼的
next week for my cousin's wedding,

504
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,340
但我知道你肯定不愿意  所以我自己去
but I know that you don't want to go, so I'll go alone.

505
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,060
你真的不去吗
You're really not gonna go?

506
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,190
你也听见她说了  她自己去没事
Well, you heard her. She's fine going alone.

507
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,660
如果飞机落地的时候是她一个人出舱
If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with her,

508
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,580
你一定会后悔的
you'll regret it.

509
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,410
也许今天明天你没有感觉
Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow,

510
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,790
但很快你就会后悔  而且会后悔一辈子
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

511
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,890
你在说什么  《卡萨布兰卡》的台词吗
What did you say? Is that "Casablanca"?

512
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:47,480
{\an8}《卡萨布兰卡》中的经典台词

513
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,800
"不难看清  在这纷纷乱世"
"It doesn't take much to see"

514
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,890
"三个小人物的问题"
"the problems of three little people"

515
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,280
"其实无足轻重"
"don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."

516
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,180
"总有一天你会明白的"
"Someday, you'll understand that."

517
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,280
"好了  没事了"
"Now, now."

518
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,480
"没事的  孩子"
Here's looking at you, kid.

519
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,030
歌洛莉亚  关于那场婚礼
Gloria! About that wedding --

520
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,890
我已经在订机票了
I'm already booking the ticket!

521
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,260
好  它长出来了
Okay, it's growing!

522
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,930
我在跟信用卡公司打电话
I'm on hold with the credit-card company.

523
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,920
我们要不找找看今晚吃什么
We should probably try and figure out dinner.

524
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,980
我连冰箱里有什么都不知--
I have no idea what we even have in the --

525
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,680
天呐  莉莉你看
Oh, my God. Lily, look.

526
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,650
大爸给我们做了这么多吃的
Daddy made us all this food.

527
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,470
"加热20分钟  余生都要爱我"
"Heat for 20 minutes. Love me for the rest of time."

528
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,720
旭日东升塔马利[墨西哥玉米粉蒸肉]
"The sun will come out tamales."

529
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,930
天呐
Oh, my God.

530
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,320
你觉得他是不是在忙着做饭
You think he forgot about my curlers

531
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,760
所以忘了帮我摘掉卷发夹
because he was too busy cooking?

532
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,610
可能是吧  我不知--
Maybe. I don't kn--

533
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,010
是的  你好
Oh, yes. Hello?

534
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,790
好--  好的  谢谢
Oka-- Okay. Well, thank you.

535
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,550
大爸买了一张机票
Um, Daddy bought a plane ticket

536
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,750
准备在国庆日给我们一个惊喜
to surprise us on the 4th of July.

537
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,740
所以我的信用卡才透支了
That's why my credit card was over the limit.

538
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,730
我好后悔当时冲着他那样喊
Now I feel bad for yelling at him.

539
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,690
是  我也后悔了
Yeah, me too.

540
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,550
{\an8}到达大厅  出发大厅

541
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,900
那么  到这儿就该结束了[队尾]
So, this is the end of the line.

542
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,590
不  不是  我跟你说过的
No. No! I told you!

543
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,110
你会来看我  我也会去看--
You're gonna come visit, I'll come there --

544
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,390
不是  我说的是安检队伍
No. I meant security.

545
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,260
那我们...  不来那些煽情的套路了
So... none of that messy stuff,

546
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,110
又不是要永别
because this is not goodbye goodbye.

547
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,010
对  离别不舍的戏还是留给那边二位吧
Yeah. We'll leave the drama to those two.

548
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,120
"亲爱的  答应我永远不要忘记我"
"Promise me you won't forget me, my darling."

549
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,920
"我会的  除非这老土套装重领时尚"
"I'll love you until this pantsuit comes back in style."

550
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,280
"我不后悔与你度过的每分每秒"
"I don't regret a single minute I've spent with you."

551
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,690
"我觉得你是我真心爱过的第一个男人"
"I think you're the first man I've ever loved."

552
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,910
每分每秒  从不后悔
Not a single minute.

553
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,030
你真的是第一个
You really are the first.

554
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,720
在我成长的过程中  有猪和牛的陪伴
Now, I had pigs and cows when I was growing up --

555
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,650
小卡
Cam!

556
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,770
噢我的天  你们来这儿干什么
Oh, my gosh! What are you guys doing here?

557
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,650
我们俩反思了一整天
We spent the whole day thinking about ourselves,

558
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,540
然后意识到...
and then realized...

559
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,760
你一整天也都在关心呵护着我们
you've spent the whole day thinking about us, too.

560
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,780
所以我拿了点东西给你带回密苏里
So I brought you something to take to Missouri.

561
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,070
我要和你一起回去  大爸
I'm coming with you, Daddy!

562
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,140
我的天呐  我能整个夏天都和她在一起
Oh, my gosh! I get to keep her for the whole summer?

563
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,260
-是的  -但你不会想念她吗
- Yeah! - But won't you miss her?

564
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,160
不  不会
No. No.

565
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,060
因为我也要跟你们一起去
Because I'm coming, too!

566
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,460
我的老--  那你的工作怎么办
My good-- well, what about work?

567
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,680
其实我在密苏里也能完成工作
Well, I figure I could work from there,

568
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,250
然后时不时也能飞回来处理事务
and, you know, fly back when I need to.

569
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,750
避暑纳凉时能被新鲜饼干香气围绕挺好的
Think I could use a summer of smelling fresh biscuits --

570
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,080
还有  显然也能扔饼干
and, apparently, throwing them.

571
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,560
看看这是谁觉得自己第一年就有资格参赛
Well, look who thinks he's gonna qualify his first year.

572
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,450
我们要回去做密苏里人了
We're gonna be Missourians!   

573
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,180
有时候你会经历
Sometimes, you have one of those days

574
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,000
被众人围绕着
where you are surrounded by people

575
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,410
却仍然觉得十分孤独的时刻
but you still feel pretty lonely.

576
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,620
你只想回到家人身边汲取安慰
All you want to do is go home to the comfort of your family.

577
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,740
但有时即使是家人都无法给你这种安慰
But sometimes, even your family can't give you that comfort.

578
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,880
因为其实他们也会遭遇和你一样的孤独
Because it turns out they've all had one of those days, too.

579
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,910
你只能隐忍地等到这种煎熬结束
All you can do is wait for days like that to be over...

580
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,310
然后你就能好好睡下
so you can go to bed

581
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,910
希望醒来后是美好的一天
and hope you wake up to a better tomorrow.

582
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,600
菲尔
Phil.

583
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,400
菲尔  我好像听到卢克房里有声响
Phil, I think I hear something in Luke's room.

584
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,180
又来
Again?

585
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,930
怎么了
What?

586
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,720
我们知道你有多喜欢家庭露营训练日
We know how much you love Family Camp.

587
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,620
但是它被取消了
But it was canceled,

588
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,150
我也觉得你们都早就对它无爱了
and I thought you were all kind of over it.

589
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,510
我们可能对它无爱  但是我们爱着彼此
We may be over it, but we're not over us.

590
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,980
你觉得要不要办个升级版家庭露营训练日
What do you think about Family Camp 2.0?

591
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,730
对啊  菲尔  赶紧的  车马上就要到了
Yeah, Phil, come on. Cab's gonna be here any minute.

592
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,810
你不用收拾点行李吗
Don't you have some packing to do?

593
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,640
为什么我们老是要等你
Why are we always waiting on you?

594
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,420
我不知道我收拾完行李要去哪儿
I don't know where I'm packing for,

595
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,870
但是我太高兴了
but I love this!

596
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,120
真棒  这些看上去多美味啊
All right. How good do these look?

597
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,320
所以它们获评"纽约最佳美食"
That's why they call them "New York's Finest."

598
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,780
就是  有美食的陪伴
Yeah, who needs a campfire

599
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,680
没有篝火露营又如何
when we've got a metal box full of gray water?

600
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,660
好了各位  合个影
Okay, everybody, picture.

601
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,320
女士  能帮我们照张相吗
Uh, ma'am? Would you mind?

602
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,040
站到后面去  你这么高  行了行了
get in the back. Get in the back. You're tall. Okay. Okay.

603
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,450
好了  说茄...
All right. And...

604
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,700
现在又少一部手机了
And now we're down to three phones.

605
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,670
老板  是老爸
Hey, boss. It's Dad.

606
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,030
我知道我才刚回来上班
I know I just started back,

607
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,690
但是如果可以  我要请几天假
but I'm taking a couple of days off, if that's okay.

608
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,390
如果不可以也没办法  我在华雷斯  
And if not, too bad. I'm in Juárez!

609
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,560
老爸  我是米奇
Hey, Dad. It's Mitch.

610
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,100
那个  我现在和小卡在密苏里
Uh, I'm in Missouri with Cam.

611
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,080
不  我不是被他绑过来的
No, it's not a hostage situation.

612
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,910
您能不能顺路到我们家帮忙浇浇花草
Anyway, uh, can you swing by our place and water our plants?

613
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,400
还有  别忘了卧室里的那盆无花果
Oh, and don't forget about the ficus in the bedroom.

614
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,030
我知道你有多爱到我们卧室里去
I know how much you love to go in there.

615
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,910
我是你姐姐  花姑娘
