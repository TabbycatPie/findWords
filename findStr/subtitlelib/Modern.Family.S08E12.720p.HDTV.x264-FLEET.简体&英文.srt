垃圾  垃圾
Crap. Crap.

辣鸡  腊鸡
Crappacino. Charlie Craplin.

00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,800
在哥伦比亚  如果有老头开始朝着信件吼
In Colombia, when the old man starts yelling at the mail,

34
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,810
我们就把他放到沙洲上  等大浪送他归西
We put them on a sandbar and wait for the tide to come in.

35
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,500
迪尔加多遇到了情人节的两难选择
Well, Delgado's got a doozy of a Valentine's dilemma.

36
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,460
我发了短信试探两个妞
I texted out feelers for two dates.

37
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,820
维琪·卢是我的首选  但是亚历克莎·波茨
Vicky Noh is top choice, but Alexa Potts has been doing

38
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,870
最近走坏女孩风也让我挺心动
this bad-girl thing lately I'm into.

39
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,590
所以等待卢答应的同时
So, while I wait for a yes from Noh,

40
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,100
我要把波茨留在候补位置
I've got to keep Potts on the back burner.

41
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,790
要命了  他还在唧唧歪歪吗
Oh, my God. Is it still talking?

42
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,100
杰  你真没礼貌
Jay, that's so rude!

43
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,010
他总是想太多
He overthinks everything.

44
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,890
只要坏女孩有机会  你上就对了
If you have a shot at the bad girl, jump.

45
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,770
我也说不准
I don't know.

46
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,720
她有个继父
She has a stepdad who

47
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,670
只关注她性感的姐姐
only pays attention to her hot older sister.

48
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,880
我会亲自帮你拨电话给她
I will dial the phone for you.

49
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,550
乔的学校打电话来  说他惹麻烦了
That was Joe's school. He's in trouble.

50
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,950
我们得去跟老师见面
We need to go meet with the teacher.

51
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,080
他搞了什么事
What the hell did he do?

52
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,210
他打劫银行并挟持了18个人质
He robbed a bank and took 18 hostages.

53
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,100
我哪知道啊  快走吧
How would I know? Let's go.

54
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,840
没戏了
It's a no-go.

55
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,530
亚历克莎今晚想在大浴缸泡澡
Alexa wanted to use the hot tub tonight,

56
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,170
但她貌似找不到泳衣  没衣服穿
but apparently can't find her bathing suit.

57
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,680
如果你回家时身上没有淡啤酒味和池水氯味
If you don't come home smelling of light beer and chlorine,

58
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,210
你就不用回来了
Do not come home at all.

59
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:11,840
亲爱的
Uh, honey?

60
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,610
情人节快乐  我的爱
Happy Valentine's day, my love!

61
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,080
谢谢
Oh, thank you. Ooh.

62
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,370
我好喜欢这个  这是什么啊
I love this. What is it?

63
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,510
当年我们初吻时  就坐在这个门廊秋千上
It's the actual porch swing where we had our first kiss.

64
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,570
-不会吧  -你看看
- No. - Check it out.

65
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,850
25年前在后面刻的字还在呢
The carvings are still on the back from 25 years ago.

66
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,030
天啊  "菲尔爱克莱尔"
Oh, my gosh. "Phil hearts Claire."

67
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,180
亲爱的  这个放在我们家门廊上一定很赞
Oh, honey, this is gonna look so great out on our porch.

68
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,460
真不敢相信你把它弄回来了
I can't believe you did this.

69
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,440
没什么啦
It was nothing.

70
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,970
不过是打了几个电话  开了半天的车
I made a few calls, drove half a day...

71
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,840
喝了点酒  跟有咸猪手的同志房东讨价还价
..had campari and haggled with a handsy gay landlord,

72
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,550
接着拆解这秋千  装上货车
took the swing apart, loaded it in a van,

73
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,750
结果车在沙漠里没油了
ran out of gas in the desert,

74
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,260
还被一个可疑的州警骚扰
got harassed by a shady state trooper,

75
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,610
最后忍着剧烈的偏头痛开回家
and drove back with a blinding migraine.

76
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,630
反正是小菜一碟啦
But easy-peasy.

77
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,760
我超喜欢的
I love it.

78
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,440
敲敲门  情人节快乐
Knock, knock. Happy Valentine's day

79
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,090
或是我称之为"最适合去逛超市的一晚"
or, as I call it, "The best night to go to the grocery store."

80
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,770
这是你的情人节礼物
And here is your valentine's gift.

81
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,160
我亲手在办公室包装的
I wrapped it myself in the office,

82
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,300
然后像个傻子一样  把礼物忘在那了  所以...
And then, like a dingdong, I left it there, so...

83
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,650
闪闪惹人爱啊
Whoa, sparkly.

84
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,990
跟你一样  所以我才选这张包装纸
Just like you. That's why I picked the wrapping.

85
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,800
-绝对是她选的  -拆开看看吧
- She sure did. - Yeah. Go ahead.

86
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,980
克莱尔  我好像猜到这是什么了
Claire, I think I know what this is.

87
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,260
真不敢相信你送我这个
I can't believe you did this.

88
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,480
可不是嘛
I know, right?

89
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,350
你送我的是一块旧手表
You got me an old watch.

90
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,420
-很酷吧  -太酷了
- Pretty cool, right? - So cool.

91
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,190
我喜怒不形于色功力很高
I've got a crazy-good poker face,

92
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,790
但其实我并不喜欢那块手表
but I didn't love the watch.

93
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,470
我之前一直强烈暗示她
I'd been dropping these big hints

94
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,710
{\an8}哈里·胡迪尼  著名魔术师  逃脱艺术家

95
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,700
我想要胡迪尼的真品手铐
about a pair of genuine Houdini handcuffs

96
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,710
我们当地魔术用品店里在打折
on sale at a local magic shop.

97
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,230
是他1923年著名的眼镜蛇棺材逃脱表演里用过的
They're from his famous coffin of cobras escape of 1923.

98
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,630
那套戏法实在太震撼了
The trick was so shocking

99
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,370
姑娘们看了都自然开始分娩
that women went into spontaneous labor

100
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,690
汉子们看了都开始疯狂对打
and the men paired off in violent fighting.

101
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,730
表好像不会动
I, uh, don't think it's working.

102
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,200
我觉得吧
Oh, well, I mean,

103
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,630
我虽然是第一次看到这块表
I'm just seeing this watch for the first time,

104
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,110
但它好像有自动上发条机制
But it looks like it's got a self-winder.

105
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,120
-你只要动动手臂...  -没错
You just move your... Yeah.

106
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,370
给表上发条了它才会动
...arm around to keep it going.

107
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,820
我该走了
I should probably get going.

108
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,950
我母亲在卡车里等我
Mother's waiting in the truck...

109
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,420
她的耐心很有限
...And she's patient until she isn't.

110
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,460
我也该去上班了
Oh, and I've got to get to work, too,

111
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,400
得赶在那些单身妹子前开工
before all the single gals show up.

112
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,210
要不然等她们在洗手间大哭  往墙上砸
It's pretty hard to concentrate with all the bathroom crying

113
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,990
吃了一半的巧克力时  就很难集中精神工作了
and the half-eaten chocolates getting hurled at the wall.

114
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,970
-工作顺利  -我会的
- Have a good one. - I will.

115
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,810
花很漂亮啊
Wow. Those are nice.

116
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,100
是啊  在前廊发现的
Yeah, they were on the front porch.

117
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
是一个神秘的仰慕者送的
They're from a mystery admirer.

118
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,330
卡片写着"你不知道自己的魔力"
The card says, "You don't know your power."

119
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,830
这是我的错
Oh, that's my bad.

120
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,520
我之前穿着拉拉队短裤
I was power-washing the flagstones

121
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,480
-使劲在洗石板路  -花是送给我的
- in my old cheer shorts -- - They're for me.

122
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,660
别问我是谁送的
Yeah, don't ask who they're from,

123
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,310
因为我也不知道  但我会找出那个人
because I don't know, but I will find out.

124
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,340
你手臂怎么了
What happened to your arm?

125
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,140
我在给这块旧表上发条
Oh, I am winding an old watch

126
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,910
是你妈妈送给我的情人节礼物
that your mother gave me for Valentine's day.

127
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,560
挺不对等啊  你可是送了她这么赞的秋千
Oh. That's pretty uneven. You gave her this awesome swing.

128
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,370
妈妈到底从哪里捡到你这个暖男
Man, where did mom find a guy as sweet as you?

129
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,650
其实是她开车撞到我
Actually, she hit me with her car

130
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,210
我当时正在肯德基的停车场跳霹雳舞
when I was break-dancing in a KFC parking lot.

131
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,230
再说你妈妈也不是不浪漫
And your mother's not unromantic.

132
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,030
她只是最近工作很忙
She's just been busy with work lately.

133
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,150
反正你们的确也结婚25年了
Well, you've been married for like 25 years.

134
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,070
这话什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

135
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,600
你们俩之间的浪漫火花
You guys are overdue for the romance

136
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,840
老早前就该熄灭了
to fizzle out a little bit.

137
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,060
不知名的跟踪狂给你送了
Oh, well, it's nice to know that some dime-store posies

138
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,140
一束便宜的花
from an unnamed stalker have

139
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,200
你就瞬间变成情感专家了吗  真不错
made you an expert on matters of the heart.

140
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,800
其实你妈妈还是有浪漫细胞的
It so happens that your mother is still very romantic,

141
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,260
等我今天下午去她办公室送惊喜
which I will prove with a surprise visit

142
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,160
就能证明给你看
to her office this afternoon.

143
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,160
我来猜猜看  你在屋里拼好秋千
Let me guess -- you built this inside

144
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,660
而你没事先量过门的高度
and didn't measure the door?

145
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,760
卡片说得对  你不知道自己的...
Card was right. You don't know your own power...

146
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,330
毒舌魔力
to be mean.

147
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,430
谢谢你来帮忙
Thank you so much for helping us out.

148
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,990
反正雷纳要上班
Ah, yeah. Rainer has work, anyways.

149
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,090
他情人节这天
He does this Valentine's day thing

150
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,150
-都会用雷达追踪丘比特  -好有爱
- where he tracks cupid on the radar. - Aww, cute.

151
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,960
莉莉今天能晚点睡觉
Oh, and Lily gets to stay up a little later tonight

152
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,630
因为她在学校做了一件勇敢的事
because she had a big-girl moment at school.

153
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,150
没错  有个男生杰格  这歌名也能当名字了
Yes, this boy Jagger -- 'cause that's a name now --

154
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,480
嘲笑她  她当着大家的面教训了他一顿
teased her and she told him off in front of everybody.

155
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,880
我们为你感到骄傲  因为你用自己的话教育了他
And we're proud of you because you used your words.

156
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,040
她用的是我们的话  我们给她写过一段话
She used our words. We wrote her a little speech.

157
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,830
她狠狠地用来给那孩子上了一课
She really told that kid off good.

158
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,440
我们的社会教导女性要谦逊
Our society encourages women to be unassertive,

159
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,110
所以我们要想尽办法让莉莉更强大
so we need to do everything we can to -- to really empower lily.

160
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,650
我们虽然不追求女人
We may not get women,

161
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,150
但这恰恰让我们更理解女性
but that allows us to really get women.

162
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,600
我们不跟女性搞在一起
We may not hook up with women,

163
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,330
但我们真的很了解女性
but we really understand women.

164
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,020
我刚才就说得够清楚了
I think it was clear when I said that.

165
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,680
所以为什么要"早点开始约会"
So, what's with this whole "going out early" thing.

166
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,750
我们很久没有到外面约会过了
Well, it's been forever since we've had a date-night out,

167
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,940
所以我们列出了六件情人节心愿
and so we made a little list of the six things

168
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,060
是我们一直想做但没机会做的
that we love to do but never get to do.

169
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,130
真可悲
Ugh, pathetic.

170
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,830
我们可以这么吐槽自己  但你不行
Okay, we get to say that, not you.

171
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,000
不不不  是迪兰
No, no, no, it's Dylan.

172
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,390
每年情人节他都发短信给我  求我跟他上床
He texts me every Valentine's day begging to hook up.

173
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,610
的确挺悲哀
Oh, that is sad.

174
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,620
就是啊  几乎每次都失败
I know. It almost never works.

175
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,040
老家伙们
All right, you old bags,

176
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,840
把假牙戴上  带我出去浪
put your teeth in, you're taking me out.

177
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,800
萨尔  你怎么来了
Sal, what are you doing here?

178
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,920
今天是情人节
It's Valentine's day and my

179
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,230
而我的新德国男友维尔纳去外地了
new German boyfriend, Werner, is out of town,

180
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,110
我不喜欢一个人喝闷酒
and I don't like to drink alone.

181
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,720
前半句是真的
The first part's true.

182
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,200
其实我们已经订好计划了
Well, actually, we have plans.

183
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,050
但现在你们有更好的计划了
Aw, but now you have better plans.

184
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,740
福斯塔可以照看萨米
Fausta here can babysit Sammy

185
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,720
和那边那个亚洲娃
and General Tso over there.

186
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,870
萨米  跟你基佬叔叔们问好
Sammy, tell your guncles hello

187
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,850
用我教你的那样
like I taught you.

188
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,250
幸会
Enchante.

189
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,580
我正目睹的是什么情况
Ahh! What am I looking at here?

190
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,900
我要从娃娃抓起把他培养成基
I'm raising him gay.

191
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,110
告诉你米奇尔叔叔你觉得他那条裤子怎么样
Tell Uncle Mitchell what you think about those pants.

192
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,410
丑得惨绝人寰
Tragic.

193
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,410
他记住了
Oh, it's sticking!

194
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,660
快来  我们走
So, come on. Let's go. Uh...

195
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,660
如果有她照看孩子们
Hey, if she's watching the kids,

196
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,980
我不想当多余的第四者
I don't want to be a fourth wheel,

197
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,250
所以让我跟你们仨一起去吧
so I'll just come and join you three.

198
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,500
好主意
That-that sounds great.

199
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,790
米奇尔  我们去壁炉旁聊两句好吗
Mitchell, can I talk to you over by the fireplace?

200
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,680
好
Yeah, yeah.

201
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,330
-我们的计划怎么办  -你了解萨尔
- Hey, so what about our plans? - Look, you know Sal.

202
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,090
如果我们不答应她是不会走的
She's not gonna leave until we agree to this.

203
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,600
我们先哄她俩喝起来
So, look, we'll just get the two of them drinking.

204
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,110
她们不会注意到我们悄悄溜走
They won't even notice when we slip away,

205
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,230
然后我们就回到自己的心愿表上
and, you know, get back to our list.

206
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
-真是个好计划  -是吧
- That's a good plan. - Yeah.

207
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,600
反正我本来也不想做心愿表上的第一项
You know what? I didn't even want to do number one anyway.

208
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,540
那让我觉得自己肮脏又羞愧
It makes me feel dirty and ashamed.

209
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,270
好吧  那就不去起司蛋糕餐厅了
Okay, well, bye-bye, Cheesecake Factory.

210
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,320
就这样吧
Wow. All right.

211
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,070
我今天请二位过来是因为
I asked you guys to come in today because

212
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,680
乔送了我非常不合适的情人节礼物
Joe has given me a very, um, inappropriate Valentine's Day gift.

213
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,900
我想这应该是他从家里拿来的吧
I assume that he got this from home?

214
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,410
克拉克老师  我太抱歉了
Ms. Clarke, I am so sorry.

215
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,860
我保证乔根本不明白他在做什么
I'm sure that Joe doesn't even know what he was doing.

216
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,450
看来我终于有机会和儿子抢着看
Looks like I'm finally gonna get to fight with one son

217
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,760
《体育画报泳装女郎特辑》了
over the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.

218
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,520
杰  这不好笑
Jay, this is not funny.

219
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,270
我家族里的男人总是太过"敢性"
I come from a very long line of overly sexy men.

220
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,980
我表亲理卡多是性加者
My cousin Ricardo, he had a sex addition.

221
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,680
你是想说性"瘾"吧
You mean "addiction."

222
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,890
是的  抱歉
Uh, yeah, sorry.

223
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,280
他在家里"瘾"盖了一间炮房
He built an addiction onto his house

224
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,730
只用来和众多女友做爱
for making love to his many girlfriends.

225
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,930
你们只要让乔知道
Well, Joe just needs to know

226
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,040
送这种礼物是不合适的就好了
that this type of gift is not okay.

227
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,690
您是对的  我会和他谈谈的
And you're right, and I'm gonna talk to him.

228
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,600
我做错事了吗
Did I do something wrong?

229
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,690
你的确未经同意从妈妈的抽屉里偷拿东西
You did take something out of your mom's drawer without asking.

230
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,450
但这次我就先睁一只眼闭一只眼吧
But I'm gonna give you a pass on that one.

231
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,180
重点是  你送那种礼物非常不合适
The thing is, the gift was inappropriate.

232
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,270
可是你也送妈妈内裤啊
Well, you give underpants to Mom.

233
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,330
没错
True.

234
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,810
你每年都送
You do it every year.

235
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,110
你可以送那种礼物
Look, you can give that kind of thing

236
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,860
给你妻子或女朋友
to your wife or your girlfriend.

237
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:23,250
但送老师就不能这样了  知道吗
But it's a little bit different when it's your teacher, okay?

238
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,040
好吧  我能回到宁静室去了吗
Fine. Can I go back to the quiet room now?

239
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,340
我已经错过一半的午睡时间了
I already missed half of my nap.

240
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,750
你知道我不午睡会怎么样
You know how I get.

241
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,010
当然  去吧
Sure. Go ahead.

242
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,430
都讲清楚了
Everything's squared away.

243
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,000
克拉克老师  抱歉给您添麻烦了
Ms. Clarke, sorry for the trouble.

244
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,620
请问内衣可以还给我吗
May I have that back?

245
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,410
天啊  不好意思
Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.

246
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,050
我都不知道人类身材能到如此境界
I didn't know that real humans could have these dimensions.

247
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,080
-谢谢  -过奖了
- Thanks. - Thank you.

248
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,360
我好像不小心掉出了备份的酒店房卡
I seem to have dropped my spare hotel key.

249
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,400
-菲尔  -嘘
- Phil -- - Shh.

250
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,370
无论这个菲尔是谁  不必惊动他
No need to call whoever this Phil is.

251
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,500
你很安全
You're in no danger.

252
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,150
这张房卡是街尾华美达酒店422号房的
This key is to room 422 at the Ramada down the street.

253
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,570
找到机会就溜出来
Slip out when you can.

254
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,430
我会先把烟雾警报器关掉
I'll pre-disable the smoke detectors

255
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,910
这样在你甩掉那条得体阔腿裤时
so you don't set it off when you shimmy out

256
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,780
就不会因为太过惹火触发警报了
of those sensible wide-leg trousers.

257
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,220
在过去几年的情人节里
For the past several Valentine's,

258
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,910
我们会变身性感第二人格
we've adopted sexy alter egos --

259
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,260
狂野又随性的朱莉安娜
Juliana, wild and spontaneous,

260
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,220
和克莱夫  这位对
And Clive, passionate collector

261
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,640
搜集美女和古董航海图十分有热情的男人
of beautiful women and antique sailing maps.

262
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,720
克莱夫  我很喜欢这个主意
Clive, I love this id-

263
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,410
保留点体力  亲爱的
Save that energy, my dear.

264
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,980
在这间酒店房间时间不长
This hotel has a very short memory

265
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,450
但有很长的室外楼梯要爬
and a very long outdoor staircase.

266
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,590
克莱尔  你得把这些合同签好
Claire, you have to finish signing these contracts.

267
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,550
你好  菲尔
Hey, Phil.

268
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,170
我不是菲尔
Phil? No.

269
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,890
我叫克莱夫  朋友
Name's Clive, friend.

270
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,150
或许你能管一会儿事
Say, maybe you could take over here for a bit.

271
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,180
我会把你们女老板完整无缺送回来的
I'll make sure the boss lady's back in one piece

272
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,230
最晚不超过...
no later than --

273
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,680
有没有搞错
Oh, come on.

274
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,250
-你好  菲尔  -他现在是克莱夫
- Hi, Phil. - It's Clive, actually.

275
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,520
他们之间有玩角色扮演  就像你和你姐姐
Apparently they have a thing like how you and your sister

276
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,910
扮成毛绒玩具去参加那些聚会一样
go to those conventions dressed like stuffed animals.

277
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,990
克莱尔  你两点的预约到了
Oh. Uh, Claire, your 2:00 is here

278
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,070
你不能迟到
and you can't be late.

279
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,600
菲尔  我真的很感激你做的这些  真的
Phil, look, I really appreciate this. I do.

280
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,680
-只是我  -我去花店问过了
- It's just that -- - So, I spoke to the florist.

281
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,730
原来我的仰慕者
Turns out my admirer

282
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,180
是从普里契特衣柜公司订的花
sent these from Pritchett's Closets.

283
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,060
或许我的情路不顺  但我不用我妈
I may have a sad love life, but I don't need my mommy

284
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,670
送花来帮我抬高自尊心
trying to boost my self-esteem.

285
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,180
如果你真的想让我更有自信
And if you really want to give me some confidence,

286
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,440
为什么不在桌子上也摆张我的照片
how about a picture of me on your desk,

287
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,630
而不是只摆海莉和卢克的照片
and not just Haley and Luke.

288
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,910
首先  花不是我送你的
First of all, I didn't give you those flowers.

289
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,160
其次  我摆了你的照片
Second of all, there is a picture of you.

290
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,410
哪去了
Where is it?

291
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,790
问候您
Salutations.

292
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,000
你好
Yes, hello.

293
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,080
我有会要开
I've got a meeting.

294
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,930
本  你把合同什么的搞定
Ben, you're gonna finish the contract stuff.

295
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,440
玛格丽特  艾丽克斯交给你
Margaret, you're gonna take Alex.

296
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,750
你们去查是谁用我们的账户订花  好吗
You're gonna find out who's using our account for flowers, okay?

297
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,310
菲尔  亲爱的
Phil, honey,

298
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,750
我们晚点再庆祝情人节  好吗
We'll do Valentine's Day later, okay?

299
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,230
那个穿斗篷的人怎么那么眼熟
Do I know that guy in the cloak?

300
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,360
他是铰链专家  你可能在这见过他
Ah, hinge specialist. You might've seen him around.

301
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,620
遇到新奇的转环和角度奇怪的钩扣
He's the guy for offbeat swivels

302
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,270
我们都找他
and rare-beveled hook joints.

303
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,050
你刚刚说的一切都太挑逗人了
I find everything you just said very titil-

304
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,500
晚餐时我再弥补你  我保证
We'll make up for this later over dinner, I promise.

305
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,700
我一切都计划好了
I've got it all planned.

306
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,910
我都没必要搞克莱夫这一出
This whole Clive thing wasn't even necessary.

307
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,020
克莱尔早就计划好和我一起吃晚餐了
Claire was taking me out to dinner all along.

308
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,570
浪漫还像以往一样浓烈
Romance strong as ever.

309
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,630
玛格丽特  快帮我和菲尔
Margaret, get a reservation

310
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,140
预定一下晚餐  哪都行
for me and Phil tonight, anywhere.

311
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,060
我忙得根本没有闲心想这些事了
I've got too much going on to even think about it.

312
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,920
维尔纳人可好了
Werner is great.

313
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,780
他是个有钱的音乐家
You know, he's a rich musician,

314
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,450
总去巡演  不缠人
tours a lot, no strings.

315
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,580
那个吧
Well, um...

316
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,680
今天玩得真开心  但我们该...
...This has been fun, but we should, uh...

317
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,680
你哪也别想去  红毛
You're not going anywhere, carrot bottom.

318
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,910
我的天  那是雷纳吗
Oh, my god. Is that Rainer?

319
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,460
他为什么和别的女人在一起
Why is he with another woman?

320
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,960
貌似有捉奸好戏看了
That sounds cheat-y.

321
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,550
他是海莉的天气预报员男友
That's Haley's weatherman boyfriend.

322
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,210
-抱歉  小海  -我们快走吧
- Sorry, Hale. - We need to leave.

323
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,680
不行  你得和他当面对质
No, you got to go confront him.

324
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,040
我很难受  喝了好几杯了  不去比较好
Mm. I'm upset. I've had a couple drinks. No.

325
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,860
好吧
Okay.

326
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,810
和其他加拿大杂技演员一起世界巡演有趣吗
So, what's it like touring the world with other Canadian acrobats?

327
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,550
什么
What?

328
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,620
我们还以为你是杂技团的呢
We just assumed you were a member of cirque du soleil.

329
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,720
是啊  因为你柔软到能把
Yup, because you're bending over backwards

330
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,010
脑袋弯到背后来逃避面对事实
to avoid standing up for yourself.

331
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,220
为其他女性
And setting a good example

332
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,380
树立好榜样
for other women.

333
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,920
你们都这么想的吗
You both were thinking that?

334
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,560
-好  -终于
- Fine. - Finally.

335
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,620
我差点以为她
I was beginning to think she was weaker

336
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,080
比米奇尔的下巴还脆弱
than Mitchell's jawline.

337
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,890
大家都知道你为什么留那玩意儿
Everyone knows why you grew that thing.

338
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,120
好吧  这吐槽居然是来自一个
Okay, this coming from the woman who -- who won't admit

339
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,020
不愿意承认自己在情人节
that she's upset that her boyfriend abandoned her

340
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
被男友抛下的事实而不开心的人
on Valentine's day.

341
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,670
你不是刚跟印第安人
Oh, and didn't you just get back from learning

342
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,210
学种玉米回来吗
how to plant corn with the Indians?

343
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,640
因为在我们来看你就像早期定居者
Because you look, to us, like an early settler.

344
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,170
定居者
Settler.

345
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,040
我们是说你找了配不上你的人[定居]
We're saying that you settle.

346
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
你们在家排练过了  对吧
You practice this at home, don't you?

347
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,540
-才没有  -才没有
- We do not. - We do not.

348
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,690
我知道那雷声不可能是天使在打保龄球...
Now, I knew it couldn't be angels bowling, so --

349
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,780
我以为你今天要上班
I thought you were working today.

350
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,730
我们不是说好你再也不穿这件毛衣的吗
And didn't we agree that you never wear that sweater again?

351
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,890
-我...  -不好意思
- My...  - Excuse me.

352
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,320
我们在约会
We're kind of on a date right now.

353
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,730
-海莉  -省省吧  你这满嘴谎言
- Uh, Haley. - Oh, save it, you lying,

354
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,850
脚踏两条船的中年"指"男癌
cheating, middle-aged pointer.

355
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,140
你这人就是这样  指来指去的
That's what you do, you know -- you point.

356
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,730
靠一指神功挣钱  我们结束了
You point for your money! We are done!

357
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,360
情人节快乐
Happy Valentine's day.

358
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,990
我的发型
My hair.

359
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,880
刚才感觉真是又疯狂
Oh, that was crazy

360
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,240
又酸爽又糟糕  我现在不知道要怎么办
and great and awful and I don't know what to do.

361
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,830
我要回家了
I'm just gonna go home.

362
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,600
什么  别啊  我现在喜欢你了
What?! No! I like you now.

363
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,100
维尔纳有一艘带酒吧的游艇  一起去吧
Werner has a yacht with a full bar. Let's go.

364
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,610
这么嗨  我才不会让你回家
I'm not letting you go home in this mood.

365
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,530
好吧  去船上酒吧喝酒感觉像是
Okay, well, you know, that sounds kind of like

366
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,780
女生的活动  那...
a girl thing, so...

367
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,670
如果是雷纳打来找借口的
Oh, okay, if that's Rainer calling to make excuses,

368
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,100
别接
don't answer.

369
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,910
是可怜的迪兰打来求约炮的
It's just pathetic Dylan trying to hook up again.

370
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,840
我来搞定  嘿  小可爱
Let me handle this. Hey, boo boo.

371
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,610
又一位女性受我们激励
Well, another woman empowered.

372
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,450
-这就是我们的使命  -没错
- It's what we do. - Yes, it is.

373
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,850
好了  回到心愿表
Okay, back to the list.

374
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,210
等等  是莉莉
Oh, wait one second. It's Lily.

375
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,940
亲爱的  有什么事吗
Hey, honey. Is everything okay?

376
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,440
杰格听了我们那套话语很受伤
Jagger was very hurt by our speech.

377
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,510
莉莉没回他短信
She didn't answer his texts

378
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,410
因为我们叫她别回
'cause we told her not to.

379
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,190
很好
Good.

380
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,770
-他离家出走了  -真的吗
- He ran away. - He did?

381
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,140
大家正组成人链
People are forming a human chain

382
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,600
在森林里找他
to search for him in the woods.

383
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,630
好的  亲爱的  我们马上回家  好吗
Okay, honey, well, we'll be home soon, all right?

384
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,430
你觉得杰格这件事
Do you think we have some responsibility

385
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,810
咱们有责任吗
in this Jagger situation?

386
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,350
没有  没有
Ah...No. No.

387
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,350
他们自己要住到森林附近的
They -- they chose to build near the woods.

388
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,820
我们的建议是好的
Good advice is good advice, okay?

389
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,150
-也对  -二位  海莉呢
- That's right. - You guys, where's Haley?

390
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,120
她在码头边的一艘船上
Um, she is on a boat in the marina,

391
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,130
把你抛到脑后[后视镜外]了
putting you in her rearview mirror.

392
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,020
-船有后视镜吧  -应该有
- Boats have those, don't they? - I think so.

393
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,840
二位  我只是让那女士以为
You guys, I was only letting that woman

394
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,400
我们在约会
think we were on a date

395
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,780
因为她是一个名人网站的站长
because she runs a celebrity site

396
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,760
专从狗仔手里买照片
that buys photos from paparazzi, okay?

397
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,900
我想把其中一张拿回来
I was trying to get one of me back

398
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,080
因为照片里有海莉  就是这张
because Haley is in it and this is the photo.

399
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,590
-不  天  不  -我的天
- No. God, no. - Oh, my gosh.

400
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,790
刚起床的发型  喷嚏脸  UGG丑拖鞋
Bedhead, sneeze face, and ugg slippers?

401
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,600
海莉不接我电话
And now Haley's not answering my calls

402
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,260
而15分钟后我还得笑着
and somehow I'm supposed to smile through a weather report

403
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,360
播报天气
in 15 minutes?

404
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,310
别慌  雷纳
Pull yourself together, Rainer.

405
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,200
你可是天气播报员
You're a weatherman.

406
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,380
你会不会觉得我们的建议...
Do you think our advice --

407
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,610
糟糕透顶  对  对
Sucked? Yes. Yes.

408
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,680
我们得在海莉勾搭上迪兰前
We need to get to that boat

409
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,220
赶到船上去
before Haley hooks up with dylan.

410
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,850
她不会做那么蠢的事吧
She wouldn't do something that stupid.

411
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,190
你看到那双Ugg丑鞋了吧
Did you see the uggs?

412
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,500
好吧  对  对  对
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,530
妈  我回来了
Mom, I'm home.

414
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,260
我们买了情人节礼物
We got Valentines.

415
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,170
你好  丘利夫人
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kewley.

416
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,440
派对结束了吗
Is the party over?

417
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,570
出了点小状况
We had an incident.

418
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,360
你儿子给我们贝莉
Your son gave my Bailey

419
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,890
送了一个很奇怪的情人节礼物
a very strange Valentine's gift.

420
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,760
真对不起
I am so sorry.

421
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,550
你爸不是已经跟你说过这件事了吗
Didn't your father talk to you about this already?

422
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,670
对啊  他说可以送给女朋友
Yeah, and he said it's okay to give it to a girlfriend.

423
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,370
我们走了  贝莉才不是他女朋友
We're going. And Bailey is certainly not his girlfriend.

424
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,820
那是她的福气
She would be lucky!

425
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,350
那是贝莉吗
Is that Bailey?

426
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,390
我记得乔对她有意思
'Bause I think Joe has a little thing for her.

427
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,290
他的确有很有"意思"的东西给她
Yeah, he did have a little thing for her.

428
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,940
在这儿  他又来了
It's here. He did it again.

429
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,740
我就知道不能放心交给你去教育他
I knew I shouldn't have trusted you talking to him,

430
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,710
就算他杀了人你也会帮他脱罪
because you will let him get away with murder

431
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,920
因为他就是迷你版的你  你还特高兴
because he's a mini you and you like it.

432
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,950
更糟的是什么你知道吗
And you know what's worse?

433
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,490
你对曼尼那么小心眼
That you're so mean to Manny

434
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,170
就是因为他跟你不一样
because he's different than you.

435
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,460
首先  乔不是迷你版的我
First off, Joe is not a mini me.

436
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,070
垃圾  辣鸡  蜡鸡
Crap. Crapola. Crapinski.

437
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,340
好吧  可能有一点
Well, maybe a little,

438
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,880
也许我却是有点喜欢这事
and maybe I kind of like it.

439
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,270
可你为什么要把乔身上我的影子去掉呢
But why would you want to knock the Jay out of Joe?

440
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,590
你从拥有一个宝贝变成两个宝贝呢
Instead of one trophy, you get two.

441
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,130
到了  谢天谢地
Okay, thank God.

442
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,020
她在这呢
Oh, gosh, there she is.

443
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,410
你们怎么来了
What are you guys doing here?

444
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,720
需要水手来完成你们
Need a sailor to cross off number four

445
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,190
情人节心愿表的第四条吗
on that Valentine's day list of yours?

446
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,750
跟萨尔待了一会儿  嘴都没把门了
Was that mean i've been around Sal, I've lost my filter.

447
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,040
你知道吗  人非圣贤孰能无过
You know what? We all make mistakes.

448
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,440
等我们告诉你一个
Which is a-a funny thing to remember

449
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,290
很可笑的误会后  你回想起来都会觉得好笑
when we tell you about a very funny misunderstanding.

450
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,310
卡梅隆  米奇尔  真是惊喜
Cameron, Mitchell, what a pleasant surprise.

451
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,400
萨尔  你还好吗  你看起来怪怪的
Sal, you okay? You seem not yourself.

452
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,010
是啊  咋不眨眼呢
Yeah, I feel like you used to blink.

453
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,670
我听了你们的建议  给维尔纳打了电话
I took your advice. Called Werner.

454
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,650
跟他说我不想就这么委身下嫁
Told him I wasn't going to settle.

455
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,550
然后...
How did that --

456
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,050
然后呢
How -- how did that go?

457
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,550
他本来觉得我们或许能有未来
He was thinking that we might be something special,

458
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,400
然后我给他下了最后通牒
and then I gave him the ultimatum,

459
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,500
结果他说  "也许我们有缘无分"
and he said, "Maybe we're not actually meant to be."

460
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,560
什么情况  萨尔  你在干什么
I don't know what's happening. S-sal, w-what are you doing?

461
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,950
收拾收拾
Straightening up.

462
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,470
这是所有东西的...
You know, a place for everything...

463
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,950
-别  -...好去处
- No. - ...everything in its place.

464
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,560
这个如何
Hey, what about this?

465
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,920
这其实是从二战知名战舰上淘来的宝贝
This was actually salvaged from the Bismarck.

466
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,600
好...
That's...

467
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,650
你还助纣为虐
Why are you helping?

468
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,880
爽  男人都是坏东西
Feels good. Men suck.

469
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,440
不不  不是所有男人
No, no, n-not all men, okay?

470
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,660
我们刚跟雷纳谈了
We -- we just talked to Rainer,

471
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,130
他不是在约会
and, um, that wasn't a date.

472
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,050
什么
What?!

473
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,410
为什么砸了
Okay, why did you break that?

474
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,830
因为现在我气的是你们
'Cause now I'm mad at you!

475
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,620
你们让我跟他分手
You made me break up with him!

476
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,920
我的天 我得给雷纳打个电话
Oh, my God. Now I have to call Rainer,

477
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,720
还有迪兰
and Dylan.

478
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,180
-萨尔  亲爱的  -萨尔  别...
- Oh, Sal, sweetie... - Sal, you gotta --

479
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,260
酒洒了
You're spilling there.

480
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,300
-提起来  瓶口提起来  -笨手笨脚
- Lift it, lift it. - Oh, clumsy, clumsy.

481
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,640
让一切化作灰烬随风而去吧
I'll just make it all go away.

482
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,780
-别  我们还在船上呢  -住手  萨尔
- No! We are still on board. - No, Sal.

483
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,880
抱歉我们叫你打给维尔纳
We are sorry we made you call Werner.

484
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,500
我们不知道事情会变成这样
We didn't know that that was gonna happen.

485
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,270
你得理解一下你...
So you have to understand that you...

486
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,060
米奇尔你不来帮忙吗
Mitchell you want to step in here?

487
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,990
我吹到都头晕了
I'm getting dizzy.

488
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,670
我...
I am --

489
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,430
-别拦我  -不许再这样了
- Stop it! - Okay, no more.

490
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,930
不许再点火柴了  不许了
No more matches. No more matches.

491
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,260
好了  可是我也不知道该怎么做
Okay, what -- I don't know what to do.

492
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,570
好吧  或许我们可以...
Okay, well, maybe we should just...

493
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:26,970
维纳尔宝贝的托尼奖奖杯
Werner's precious Tony award.

494
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,800
他把它留在船上做为终极催情神器
He keeps in at sea as the ultimate aphrodisiac.

495
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,120
这不对女人催情吧
For women?

496
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,050
{\an8}托尼奖是美国剧场界最高荣誉
参选项目包含话剧与音乐剧  受到同性恋关注

497
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,050
再会[德语]  托尼奖最佳编曲奖杯
Auf Wiedersehen, award for best orchestration.

498
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,880
-要命了  -不行  萨尔  萨尔
- Oh, my God. - No. Sal, Sal.

499
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,030
-海利  快来帮忙  -不行
- Haley, help. - No.

500
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,550
我可不要告诉你同志儿子
I will not tell your gay son

501
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,070
你把一座托尼奖奖杯丢进海里乐
that you threw a Tony into the ocean.

502
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,850
-你快给我  -不要
- Give it to me! - No!

503
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,460
天啊  她掉下去了吗
Oh, my god. Did she fall in?

504
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,980
没有  
No.

505
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,270
"她"安全在我手里呢
 I've got her right here.

506
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,970
萨尔  我们真的很抱歉
Sal, we are so sorry.

507
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,460
如果不是我们出的馊主意
If it wasn't for our stupid advice,

508
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,630
你就不会没事找事  事情也就不会变这样
you would've left things alone and things might've been okay.

509
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,920
-你闭嘴  -好  好的
- Shut up! - Okay, okay.

510
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,870
冷冷的海水打醒我  让我看清了现实
That cold water woke me up to the hard truth --

511
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,680
老娘聪明绝顶  闭月羞花
I'm smart, I'm beautiful,

512
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,560
床技过人  却放弃寻找更好的人就嫁人了
I'm legendary in bed, yet I do settle.

513
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,740
维纳尔的确是配不上我啊
I mean, Werner is not good enough for me.

514
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,800
我能懂为啥你们俩白痴为啥不再找了
I mean, I get why you two idiots settled.

515
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,430
毕竟对方就是你们能找到最好的人了
This is the best you're gonna do, right here.

516
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,700
你们俩简直王八配绿豆
You're perfectly matched.

517
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,720
这么看的话  某种程度上感觉好甜啊
Well, it's kind of sweet when you look at it that way.

518
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,100
是啊  与你相遇好幸运
Yeah. We are very lucky.

519
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,280
情人节快乐
Happy Valentine's day.

520
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,620
是啊  情人节快乐
Yeah, happy Valentine's day.

521
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,390
闭嘴  懂得察言观色好吗  基佬们
Shut up. Read a room, poofs.

522
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,060
玛格丽特说是你负责保管电话记录
Hey. Margaret said you keep the phone records.

523
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,120
怎么了  你为什么需要拿记录
Why? What do you need them for?

524
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,940
我想找出是谁送我的花
I'm still trying to find out who sent me those flowers.

525
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,380
-你收在这里面吗  -别打开
- You keep them in here? - No, don't.

526
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,440
别啊
Don't.

527
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,400
本  为什么我的这张照片在你的抽屉里
Ben, why do you have this photo of me in your desk drawer?

528
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,960
我猜可能是有人在整我吧
I think someone's pranking me, probably.

529
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,600
-我要走了  -好的
- I'm gonna go. - Okay.

530
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,170
别走  其实花是我送的  好了吧
Wait, look. I sent the flowers, okay?

531
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,110
当你去年夏天来这里打工时
When you temped here last summer,

532
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,490
我也被你的魅力所打动
I became tempted by your charms.

533
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,410
谢谢欣赏  但你不是都要40岁了吗
Well, thank you, but aren't you like 40?

534
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,820
什么  我才26岁啊
What? I'm 26.

535
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,060
我  我小时候吃糖上瘾
I -- I had a sweetart addiction when I was a kid

536
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,350
永久伤害到胶原蛋白  所以显老
and I permanently damaged my collagen.

537
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,970
我谈过一个又一个
Wow. I've been in a series of bizarre,

538
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,390
离奇又羞耻的恋爱
shame-filled relationships.

539
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,320
你是我妈的员工  而我还在家里蹲
You work for my mother. You still live at home.

540
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,400
-再看看你吃的各种药  快吻我  -什么鬼
- Look at all those medications. Kiss me. - What?

541
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,900
你刚才的举动很屌
Whoa. Okay, that was very cool,

542
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,700
可是我得告诉你  我把人生奉献给衣柜
but you should know that I have dedicated my life to closets,

543
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,260
我疯狂迷恋你外公
I am obsessed with your grandfather,

544
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,870
而且睡觉都抱着穿着女睡衣的等身枕头睡
and I sleep with a body pillow that I put a nightgown on.

545
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:21,390
别再说了  你越说越吸引我
Stop, you're making it better.

546
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,470
给  今晚客人很多啊  先生
Here you go. Busy night, sir.

547
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,820
想必您已经订了位子
I assume you have a reservation?

548
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,090
是的  我妻子订的
Yes. My wife made it.

549
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,420
虽然送我礼物这件事她办砸了
She kind of dropped the ball on my gift,

550
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,720
但她成功在大名鼎鼎的恩里克餐厅订到位
but she came through with a table at the legendary Enrico's.

551
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,520
先生  很抱歉  恩里克是前面另一家餐厅
I'm sorry, sir. Enrico's is a couple doors down.

552
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,570
就你一个人吗
So, just yourself?

553
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,940
不是  我今晚会跟老婆在这见面
Uh, no, I'll be meeting my wife tonight.

554
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,990
你这么乐观就对了
That's the spirit.

555
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,370
我错过了什么
What'd I miss?

556
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,420
这个薪水太高技术太水的傻子推杆没进
This overpaid bum missed a putt.

557
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,170
我怎么能不喜闻乐见
I'm supposed to not like this.

558
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,250
杰  骂我智障吧
Well, call me an idiot, Jay.

559
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,160
的确  我跟亚历克莎一起进浴缸泡澡了
Sure enough, Alexa and I did end up in a hot tub together.

560
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,470
但在她喝到第三瓶啤酒时
But around her third beer,

561
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,880
我建议她喝点水免得脱水
I suggested she have some water to stay hydrated.

562
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,410
她就想用嘴堵上我的嘴
She tried to shut me up by kissing me,

563
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,220
我的确挺享受  可她一直叫我崔维斯
which I liked, but she kept calling me Travis.

564
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,930
要命了  他还在唧唧歪歪吗
Oh, my God! Is it still talking?!

565
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,030
乔  不许你这么不尊敬你哥哥
Joe, you don't ever disrespect your brother like that.

566
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,510
也再也不许你送其他小女孩或任何人内裤
And no more giving underwear to little girls, or anyone else,

567
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,480
因为这很痴汉还很欧洲人
'cause it's creepy and European.

568
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,700
罚你回房间待着
Now go to your room.

569
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,060
你的孩子遗传到你最佳的优点的确很开心
It's fun when your kids get your best qualities,

570
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,460
但当你看到他们也学到了
but it's a kick in the gut when they pick up stuff

571
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,960
你身上的缺点时  也很难受
you hate about yourself.

572
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,420
我看到了我丑陋没耐心的一面
I saw that ugly, impatient part of me

573
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,410
从我可爱的儿子嘴里冒出来
coming out of my adorable son.

574
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,840
但公平来说  他可爱的部分也遗传自我
In fairness, that adorable part also came from me.

575
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,500
我们都遗传到了我妈的红粉面颊  松软双唇
We both got my mom's crab-apple cheeks and pillow lips.

576
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,110
亲爱的  抱歉我迟到了
Hi, honey. I'm sorry I'm late.

577
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,500
我们出了场大事故
We had a whole incident -- mwah --

578
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,170
仓库里有台涂料混合器炸了
at the warehouse, a paint mixer blew up.

579
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,910
幸好我办公室里还留了这么一套吊带裤
Luckily I had these overalls in my office I could...

580
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,650
你生气了  是吧
Oh, you're mad, aren't you?

581
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,490
生气咩
Mad?

582
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:04,340
毕竟  这是我们度过最棒的情人节吗
I mean, was this the best Valentine's day we've ever had?

583
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,120
不是
No.

584
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,990
那这是最烂的吗  是的
Was it the worst? Yes.

585
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,470
我给了你很棒的礼物
I gave you a great gift.

586
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,420
我还试着到你办公室给你惊喜
I tried to surprise you at the office.

587
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,150
而你报答我的方式就是订位吃
You repaid the effort by making a reservation

588
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,340
卡车司机餐厅  还穿成像《汤姆历险记》男主
at a truck stop and dressing up like Tom Sawyer.

589
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,100
或许这种事在任何人身上都可能发生  克莱尔
But hey, maybe this happens to everyone, Claire.

590
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,920
浪漫如浪花  浪花死沙滩
Romance fizzles. Magic dies.

591
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,620
但至少我们可以记录下浪漫死去的确切时间呢
At least we can mark the exact time it happened to us,

592
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,760
多亏了你送我这手表
thanks to my new watch,

593
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,200
一只只有1950年的超忙电话接线员
which only a switchboard operator from the 1950s

594
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,380
能保持它持续上了发条
could keep wound.

595
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,760
你是说这只表吗
You mean this watch?

596
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,640
胡迪尼手铐
The houdini handcuffs.

597
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,800
我去上了魔术课来给你当情人节惊喜
I've been taking magic lessons as a Valentine's surprise.

598
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,940
等等  那个出现在你办公室的铰链销售员
Wait a minute. The supposed hinge salesman at your office.

599
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,560
伟大的大魔师
The great majesto.

600
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,220
我就说嘛  我没认出他
Of course. I didn't recognize him

601
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,230
因为他没穿他招牌的问号拖地长袍
without his floor-length robe covered in question marks.

602
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,350
而且我们真的在过旁边的那家
And we also really do have a reservation

603
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,920
超棒餐厅有订位
at that really nice place down the street.

604
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,450
所以我们赶紧买单走人吧
So, we should probably get your check.

605
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,980
不好意思  买单
Excuse me. Can we get the check?

606
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,360
但是你穿这样能去...
But are you really dressed for...

607
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,470
太赞了  我...
So wonderful. I can't...

608
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,900
走吧  亲爱的  我们该走了
Come on, honey. We should get going.

609
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,090
等等  你有手铐钥匙吗
Wait, uh, do you have the key?

610
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,210
没有  但是你有
No. But you do.

611
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,760
我不配有你如此贤妻
I don't deserve you.

612
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,070
亲爱的  你给了我一个永生难忘的情日
Honey, you gave me a V.D. I will carry with me always.

613
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,740
就好好说"情人节"吧
Let's say "Valentine's day."

614
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,000
我一直觉得你赢不了我的礼物  但你真赢了
You know, I never thought you'd beat my gift, but you did.

615
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,120
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

616
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,750
我开始觉得我的秋千礼物像是挥棒落空
I'm beginning to think that mine was a swing and a miss.

617
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,590
才没有  你的礼物正中红心
Hardly. Yours was fantastic.

618
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,390
要我说  秋千老婆两不空
But how about a swing with a Miss?

619
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,730
-你今天真是绝了  -对啊
- You are killing it today! - I know!

620
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,110
你又把它罩上了吗
Did you cover that again?

621
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,720
没有啊  太奇怪了
I didn't. That's weird.

622
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,970
什么鬼
What the hell?

623
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,250
我把它移到了门廊
I transported it to the porch.

624
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,580
不用谢
You're welcome.

625
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,220
我没请他这么做啊
I didn't ask him to do that...

626
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,050
也没告诉过他我们住哪里
or tell him where we live.
