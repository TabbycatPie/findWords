18
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,520
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

19
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,670
The aneurysm caused his back pain. Dr. Wolke missed it.

20
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:05,770
I screwed up.

21
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,780
Compressions.

22
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,890
Dr. Wolke.

23
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,880
He's dead.

24
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,310
Take as much time as you need.

26
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,210
The virus has damaged your mother's lungs.

27
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,290
We're doing everything we can to help her.

28
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,580
120 joules.

29
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,150
I've got hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin...

30
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,760
I'm twice the size of SJ General.

31
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,710
I should have twice the amount of tests.

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,600
Oh, my God, what happened?  Is he okay?

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,560
I'm a doctor. What happened?

39
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,590
I don't know. He was running. I honked.

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,260
All of a sudden, he was in front of my car.

41
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,460
Pedestrian versus car, GCS five at scene.

42
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,820
Rigid abdomen with active bleeding.

43
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,340
Flail chest with pneumo.

44
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,730
He needs an ex lap. Now.

45
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,720
We've got a massive hemoperitoneum.

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,550
I need two large suctions and lap pads in all four quadrants.

47
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,040
There's a grade-three liver laceration

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,210
in right lateral segments.

49
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,630
Liver stitch, number 1 chromic

50
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,880
on a blunt needle and a combat gauze.

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,670
What were you doing on your bike at that hour?

52
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:09,720
Heading into work.

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,130
Trying to prep for my budget meeting with Glassman.

54
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,680
Mobilize the liver to check for any associated diaphragm injury.

55
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,110
It's the other side of town.

56
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,120
I was taking the scenic route.

57
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,920
BP's dropping.

58
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,660
He's got another bleed. Add more lap pads and run the bowel.

59
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,060
There's a perforation near the terminal ileum.

60
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,980
Something tore through the intestinal wall.

61
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,170
It's shrapnel.

62
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,860
From the accident?

63
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,030
The coat's eroded.

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,730
It looks like it's been in there a while.

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,660
It must have gotten dislodged in the accident.

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,690
How does Asher seem to you?

69
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,920
He seems fine.

70
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,430
Too fine for someone who's just lost their first patient.

71
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,030
I don't have time to worry about people being too fine.

72
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,620
- He's faking it. - Good.

73
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,530
The brain releases serotonin when you smile,

74
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,450
even if you're miserable.

75
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,730
I feel better already.

76
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,140
Denial is not a proven strategy for psychological health.

77
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,840
Dwelling on things you can't change doesn't help either.

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,830
24-year-old woman came into the ER

79
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,540
complaining of abdominal pain and headaches,

80
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,810
and, surprise, she's pregnant.

81
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,220
Apparently not a happy surprise.

82
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,450
She wants an abortion.

83
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,230
Well, what's wrong with her?

84
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,430
I assume you haven't recently learned the value of sharing,

85
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,070
which makes me think there's another reason

86
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,090
you're unloading this onto the surgical department.

87
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,990
She has a congenital IgA deficiency

88
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,870
and a history of severe infections.

89
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,080
She'll need IV antibiotics

90
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,280
and close post-surgical observation.

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,230
I figured one of your newbies may as well learn something.

Lea's birthday is tomorrow.

98
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,350
There are many cute frogs and many romantic songs.

99
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,040
I can't decide.

100
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,270
It is my first gift as her boyfriend.

101
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,130
It needs to be... awesome.

102
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,920
Well, then, maybe singing frogs,

103
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,510
however cute, might be a mistake.

104
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,470
Try something more personal or romantic.

105
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,080
And find a resident who hasn't done a suction D&C

106
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,350
and teach them.

107
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,050
No, n... no. I'll do it myself.

108
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,380
I'm not going to teach anymore.

109
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,570
I'm a good surgeon. I'll do surgery.

110
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,580
Dr. Murphy, part of your job as a surgeon is to teach.

111
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,540
You can't opt out because it's difficult.

112
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,470
I am opting out because I'm bad at it.

113
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,970
Well, you can't opt out for any reason.

114
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,910
But I may have given you too much responsibility too soon,

115
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,020
so I will supervise your supervision

116
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,560
until you get the hang of it.

117
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,280
Pick someone.

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,720
Did you two lose something?

119
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,380
Our patient.

120
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,700
Rose Babcock.

121
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,560
She's post-op from repair of a distal radius fracture.

122
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,520
60s. White hair.

123
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,550
Looks at you like she's staring into your soul.

124
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,900
Does she have a limp?

125
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,720
No.

126
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,210
Well, I think she does now.

127
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,780
Ms. Babcock, did you fall down again?

128
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,190
Oh, no, I'm fine.

129
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,730
But... but there's a poor man in room 318

130
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,480
who's in a lot of pain.

131
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,430
Let's get you back in bed.

132
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,470
Yep.

133
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,500
Apply a new Tegaderm, not antibiotic ointment.

134
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,350
They breathe.

135
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,810
Don't make us handcuff you to the bed, Rose.

136
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,100
We charge extra for that.

137
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,860
Dry the skin more so it'll stick.

138
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,360
You're doing just fine, dear.

139
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,140
Heart rate's spiking in the 130s.

140
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,130
BP 162 over 95.

141
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,360
Are you feeling any pressure in your chest?

142
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,820
No, it's just anxiety.

143
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,290
Not mine. It's one of yours.

144
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,660
We're gonna pretend,

145
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,990
since it's happening in your chest, that it's yours.

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,350
20 milligrams IV labetalol.

147
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm fine.

148
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm an empath. I can feel what other people are feeling,

149
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,860
and one of you is very stressed out.

150
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,890
Olivia, stay where you are.

151
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,560
And one milligram of Ativan.

152
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,640
Keep away from me!

153
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,520
No! Step back!

154
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,760
Sir, you were in an accident. We're taking care of you.

155
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,020
Stop. Stop it! Now!

156
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,640
Get away from me!

157
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,050
I need you to hold him down while I administer Haldol.

158
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,610
Sir, please just...

159
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,270
I'm warning you.This room is being cleared.

160
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,970
No one is gonna hurt you.

161
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,360
Ben.

162
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,940
You're having a flashback.

163
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,960
You're not in Afghanistan.

164
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,030
You're in the hospital.

165
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,140
Look around.

166
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,490
What do you see?

167
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,250
Zoe?

168
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,360
Yeah. Yeah, baby, it's me.

169
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,150
Zoe, I... I couldn't sleep.

170
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,170
I... I went for a run, and I...

171
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,340
I heard an explosion.

172
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,430
And I don't... I don't know what happened after that.

173
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,580
You were hit by a car.

174
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,870
We had to do surgery, but you're gonna be okay.

175
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,910
It's okay.

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,670
Take him back to his room, make sure he didn't open his wound.

177
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,510
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,510
Dr. Murphy?

179
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,160
Rose is not your patient.

180
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,000
She was teaching me about her gift.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,340
She says the basis of empathy is curiosity,

182
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,790
which I find curious because...

183
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,260
I'm curious about the job you're supposed to be doing.

184
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,180
Who are you leading through the D&C?

185
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,170
None of them.

186
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,200
The only one who hasn't done one does not want to,

187
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,270
so I will.

188
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,680
Which resident?

189
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,840
Wanting to is irrelevant. It's their job.

190
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,410
Wanting to is irrelevant. It's your job.

191
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,670
I'm a Christian.

192
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,640
Performing an abortion goes against my beliefs.

193
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,940
Okay.

194
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,480
You may encounter a situation one day

195
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,060
where this procedure could save a woman's life.

196
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,330
Then I hope someone else can...

197
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,650
And it's my job to make sure you can perform all surgeries,

198
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,770
including abortions.

199
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,950
So where does that leave us?

200
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,210
I'll do the surgery.

201
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,700
I've only done one.

202
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,530
I'm sure there's a lot I still can learn.

203
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,230
Dr. Murphy, you have a new student.

204
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,520
Get her started running pre-surgery assessments.

205
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,020
Thank you, Olivia.

206
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,300
That's the kind of ambition I like to see.

207
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,940
He did three tours.

208
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,250
He came home after he was injured in some kind of explosion.

209
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,470
I don't really know what happened.

210
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,120
Some... He's tried to tell me about it several times,

211
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,140
but he just... He breaks down.

212
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,990
When was he diagnosed with PTSD?

213
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,880
Two years ago.

214
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,430
But he hasn't been the same since he got back.

215
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,000
At first, he was moody, irritable.

216
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,480
Little things would set him off.

217
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,110
Then the insomnia started.

218
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,130
His mind is just... It's never at rest.

219
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,820
Nights are the worst, you know? He, um...

220
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,440
He gets these terrible nightmares.

221
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,120
Flashbacks. Just...

222
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,450
We can't sleep in the same room anymore.

223
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,020
Make sure he stays off his feet.

224
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,310
Would you like us to arrange a psych consult?

225
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,560
We've been down that road.

226
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,600
Talk therapy, group therapy, exposure therapy...

227
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,290
endless medications.

228
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,770
Let us know if you change your mind.

Jillian, I need those stuff on the elective surgery for my budget meeting.

234
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,020
And a coffee.

235
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,640
Jillian?

236
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,810
She's not there. I need approval for this.

237
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,950
And this.

238
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,380
You said I couldn't give her the frogs.

239
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,970
Oh, you can't give her this either.

240
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,440
You don't know what it is.

241
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,630
I know it would mean more

242
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,260
if you had to leave the building to get it.

243
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,330
I would like to do the suction D&C surgery.

244
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,630
I assume your religious convictions haven't changed

245
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,780
- in the last few hours. - No.

246
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,710
But I believe I was put in this program for a reason.

247
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,360
So, if you think it's important for me

248
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,210
to learn how to do an abortion,

249
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,670
then I should learn.

250
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,530
Take Jordan to the skills lab. Run the surgery steps.

251
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,540
You two will handle the D&C yourselves.

252
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,190
With you.

253
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,080
How are you going to supervise my supervision

254
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,070
if you're not there?

255
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,560
I will help you prep and debrief afterwards.

256
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,700
But this patient doesn't need

257
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,390
a gallery of strangers standing around,

258
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,380
gawking at her most private experience.

259
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,720
Sorry to interrupt.

260
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,510
Ben woke up complaining of pain.

261
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,700
Did you check the incision?

262
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,250
The pain is in his arm.

263
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,480
Now test external rotation of the shoulder.

264
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,190
We're almost done.

265
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,700
Can you describe the pain?

266
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,280
We'll call it a 10.

267
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,980
It's been hurting for years, but, this is...

268
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,280
this is something else.

269
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,430
How did you injure your shoulder before?

270
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,710
I was in a...

271
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,870
I was in a convoy in Kandahar,

272
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,630
and there was a...

273
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,640
I dislocated my...

274
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,120
You don't need to discuss it with us.

275
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,540
What did you find?

276
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,300
Swelling, sensitivity to touch, discoloration.

277
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,530
- Could be CRPS. - What is that?

278
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,940
Well, it appears the car accident aggravated a prior injury.

279
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,780
You've developed complex regional pain syndrome.

280
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,100
We'll start you on Gabapentin and Dilaudid.

281
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,820
Opioids make me a little insane.

282
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,870
We could do a stellate ganglion block.

283
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,410
It's an injection of anesthetic near the spine

284
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,100
that blocks the pain signals,

285
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,330
and could also help the PTSD.

286
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,340
I've been treated for PTSD for years.

287
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,780
Why haven't I heard about this?

288
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,150
It's experimental, but promising.

289
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,950
The procedure comes with risks:

290
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,400
vascular injury, infection, major hematoma.

291
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,290
Dr. Lim, I've been taking a risk every time I go to sleep.

292
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,700
I want to do it.

293
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,900
Stellate block is an accepted procedure for treatment of pain.

294
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,050
Which you wouldn't have suggested

295
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,560
if the patient didn't also have a mental health condition.

296
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,020
I hear Jordan's back on the D&C,

297
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,860
in spite of her righteous indignation.

298
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,070
Is something chirping?

299
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,740
I think you're being unfair.

300
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,450
Well, if anyone's being unfair, it's me.

301
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,410
I told Jordan to do it.

302
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,460
I told her.

303
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,070
We make decisions that are hard to live with all the time.

304
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,020
We make them anyway.

305
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,790
And I told her pissing off the Chief

306
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,030
was a very bad way to start your residency.

307
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,390
Glad to hear you're still moonlighting

308
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,360
as surgical department camp counselor,

309
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,520
but I don't mean you were being unfair to Jordan.

310
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,260
You're being unfair to the patient.

311
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,600
She's facing an emotionally fraught procedure.

312
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,610
She needs the support of her doctors.

313
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,920
And who she's getting is a rookie

314
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,440
who thinks she's committing murder.

315
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,110
And Shaun.

316
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,270
I have a point.

317
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,770
I'll lead Jordan through the D&C myself.

318
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,810
You're happy.

319
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,570
Dr. Murphy will be happy.

320
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,060
My cup runneth over.

321
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,680
Now get whatever's in that box out of my department.

322
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,150
Morning sickness.

323
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,180
Nurse Ella's.

324
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,460
Rose claims she can feel her pregnancy.

325
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,760
She was right about the guy in Room 318.

326
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,430
He had a clot in his ankle.

327
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,240
I'm sure she picked up on some subtle clues,

328
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,900
like the guy moaning and grasping his ankle.

329
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,170
Get a CT to rule out abdominal injury from her fall.

330
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,210
We're going to insert a thin needle into your neck

331
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,140
so we can inject the anesthetic.

332
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,530
It may sting a bit.

333
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,510
Use an in-plane approach to place the needle

334
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:23,100
between the C6 tubercle and carotid artery.

335
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,770
You might feel some discomfort.

337
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,130
What's wrong?

338
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,320
Zoe's hurt.

339
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,240
I'm okay.

340
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,260
Get some ice.

341
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,610
Let me take a look.

342
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,640
What happened?

343
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,860
I hit her.

344
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,340
I was laying next to him.

345
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,550
I know I shouldn't,

346
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,220
but the shot just made his pain feel so much better.

347
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,280
- I thought... - Zo.

348
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,360
You didn't do anything wrong.

349
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,220
There was a noise in the hall.

350
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,630
- I lashed out. - I know.

351
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,930
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

352
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,780
Nothing's broken.

353
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,360
I can get you something for the swelling.

354
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,150
No. I'm okay. I'm gonna go home, get cleaned up.

355
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,300
I just need some time.

356
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,080
I love you.

357
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,560
I think we can help Ben.

358
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,610
There have been some promising results

359
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,180
using Vagal Nerve Stimulation to treat PTSD.

360
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,560
His scarring would make it impossible

361
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,330
to expose and find the nerve without damaging it.

362
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,630
Those scars are the reason that we need to try.

363
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,050
Imagine reliving your worst nightmare over and over again.

364
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,970
Why doesn't anyone around here

365
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,610
want to do the job they were hired for?

366
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,560
What Ben needs is psychological help.

367
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,660
I've ordered a consult.

368
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,710
Leave it to the people who are trained to do it.

369
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,720
It sets a bad precedent to force a resident

370
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,350
to do a procedure they're not comfortable with.

371
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,610
Wow. Does anyone around here not have an opinion

372
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,450
about who should do that damn abortion?

373
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,280
Jordan had a choice, and in my opinion, she made the right one.

374
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,490
It's not a true choice if you're coerced by your boss.

375
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,330
I asked her to do her job.

376
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,330
You took an opportunity from a resident who wants to learn

377
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,900
in favor of one who doesn't.

378
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,420
Is this song and dance about Jordan doing the procedure

379
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,840
or your niece not doing it?

380
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,060
Neither.

381
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,610
There's a misconception that Olivia came to St. Bonaventure

382
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,000
because of me.

383
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,940
She's here because of your reputation.

384
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,550
The great Dr. Lim,

385
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,190
a master class in technique, professionalism, empathy.

386
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,310
Lately, it doesn't seem like that reputation holds up.

387
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,660
I'm giving you an antibiotic to prevent infection.

388
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,700
The vacuum aspiration will take about 15 minutes,

389
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,880
and you'll be numbed with a local anesthetic.

390
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,700
Conscious sedation is also an option,

391
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,430
but you will need someone to drive you home afterwards.

392
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,900
Do you have any questions for me?

393
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,490
I'm scared.

394
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,340
Are you certain you wanna go ahead with the abortion?

395
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,220
Yes.

396
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,450
Then you don't have to be scared.

397
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,820
You're the making the right decision for you.

398
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,240
Give her another 400 micrograms of misoprostol.

399
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,890
I'll be back for the procedure.

400
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,940
This doesn't work.

401
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,100
I need these numbers in spreadsheet format.

402
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,320
- Thank you. - Oh, excuse me.

403
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,840
Dr. Park?

404
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,410
Rose's CT was normal.

405
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,590
Get an upper GI barium study.

406
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,860
First quarter supply costs you requested.

407
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,940
Also, one of your first-years seems upset.

408
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,650
He's been in the stairwell for a while.

409
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,250
Everything okay in here?

410
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,590
I just needed some quiet.

411
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,260
Surgeons come into the stairwell for two reasons,

412
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,390
fire drills or doctor trauma.

413
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,590
You having a fire drill?

414
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,360
I just wish we had a more effective treatment for Ben.

415
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,520
His head's so messed up, and we can't help him.

416
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,700
I don't think this is about Ben.

417
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,960
Have you ever lost a patient

418
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,420
you knew you could have saved?

419
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,060
When covid was at its worst,

420
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,770
we had to cancel all non-urgent procedures.

421
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,150
A young mom with a heart condition was

422
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,030
more urgent than I thought.

423
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,450
And she died waiting for me to put her on the schedule.

424
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,950
How do you get past that?

425
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:24,460
You get past it because that's the job.

426
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,550
You will always remember it.

427
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,550
And you will eventually stop reliving it.

428
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,060
How can you be so sure?

429
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,440
Because if you don't, you can't be a surgeon.

430
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,320
And I'm pretty sure you're a surgeon.

431
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,620
I should get back to work.

432
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,210
Insert the speculum.

433
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,180
Now dilate the cervix.

434
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,400
Begin suction.

435
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,710
Begin gentle suction in the uterus.

436
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,220
Is anything wrong?

437
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
You're okay.

438
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,630
Dr. Allen, I can take it from here.

439
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,140
Don't worry. We're almost done.

440
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,770
You're gonna be just fine.

441
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,990
You have no idea what that woman was going through,

442
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,150
and you made it worse for her.

443
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,070
I know. I didn't...

444
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,440
You had an opportunity to opt out

445
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,860
before you walked into that room,

446
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,320
but you agreed to do the procedure,

447
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,080
you took on an obligation to that patient,

448
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,280
and you failed her.

449
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,740
If you ever do anything like that again,

450
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,910
I will have you removed from my program.

451
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,790
Maybe you should be cleaning bedpans for a while.

452
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,580
Hopefully there's no moral objection to that.

453
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,600
Why are there adult toys on my desk?

454
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,970
I've heard good things about the Llama,

455
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,350
but online reviews aren't always accurate.

456
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,060
Do you have a favorite?

457
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,530
They're for Lea.

458
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,610
Which one do you like the most, Claire?

459
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,290
Evidence suggests that trauma changes the way the brain works.

460
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,990
An overactive amygdala can heighten someone's response

461
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,660
to emotional stimuli, including fear.

462
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,670
I think we should consider amygdala ablation for Ben.

463
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,340
That's crazy.

464
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,800
And completely outside the scope of our care.

465
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,720
We're s...

466
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,940
We're surgeons.

467
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,310
We fix physiological problems, not mental ones.

468
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,060
It is a physiological problem.

469
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,930
His brain isn't functioning properly.

470
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,940
If it was a tumor that was causing these reactions,

471
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,810
you wouldn't hesitate to remove it.

472
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,100
But there is no tumor.

473
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,770
You're talking about inflicting damage on his brain.

474
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,900
He could suffer a stroke

475
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,860
or come out in a coma or not come out at all.

476
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,410
If you use a stereotactic laser approach

477
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,070
rather than an open craniotomy,

478
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,370
you would greatly reduce the risks.

479
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,000
This is not your case!

480
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,210
You cannot jump into this one

481
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,500
because you don't want to do the one assigned to you,

482
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,870
which is to teach, which you've made my problem

483
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,500
just like you made Lea's birthday gifts my problem.

484
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,300
You need to grow up and accept some responsibility.

485
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,870
I was diagnosed with PTSD last year.

486
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,250
I kept it mainly private.

487
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,340
Melendez really helped me through it.

488
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,880
It was nice to have a friend to lean on.

489
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,760
So if you need one...

490
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,280
I feel

491
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:04,610
off.

492
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,280
Disconnected.

493
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,700
Like I can't catch my breath.

494
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,540
But

495
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,380
it comes with the job.

496
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,300
I'll get over it.

497
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,970
It's Ben.

498
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,430
Ben.

499
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,930
No one is gonna hurt you.

500
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,990
You're having a flashback.

501
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,110
I know where I am.

502
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,070
Every day since I came home,

503
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,540
I've felt like there's a monster chasing me.

504
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,460
I try to outrun it

505
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:00,380
but I end up hurting the one I love the most.

506
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,880
I'm a threat to everyone around me.

507
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,380
No, Ben, you just need help.

508
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,140
Nothing helps.

509
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,090
I can't smile. I can't laugh.

510
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,640
I can't feel anything but pain.

511
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,230
I make everyone around me

512
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,070
suffer.

513
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:30,440
Ben.

514
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:34,080
There's a surgery that may help.

515
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,310
I would like to scrub in on the amygdala ablation surgery.

516
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,390
Rose said you're feeling overwhelmed and need...

517
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,810
I don't wanna hear any more things that woman has said.

518
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,980
Your job is to supervise your residents.

519
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,280
Why are you here instead of doing that?

520
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,150
You said you were going to supervise my supervision,

521
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,980
but you didn't.

522
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,620
You took over my case.

523
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,490
I don't know what I was supposed to learn or how.

524
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,580
Scrub in.

525
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,630
Dr. Murphy, walk Asher through the probe placement

526
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,640
and trajectory to the amygdala.

527
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,430
I will supervise your supervision.

528
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:41,020
Okay, insert the probe perpendicular to the cortical surface.

529
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,660
Stop! You're off course.

530
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,830
On the current trajectory,

531
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,080
you will penetrate a branch of the choroidal artery

532
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,790
and cause a hemorrhage.

533
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,870
Step away from the probe.

534
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:06,300
Your job is to teach, not take over.

535
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,430
Adjust the probe one millimeter inferiorly.

536
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,190
Avoid the temporal horn on your right.

537
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,070
I can't see it on the image guidance.

538
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,190
Tell Asher what you see.

539
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:42,660
It should point toward your six o'clock on the Y axis.

540
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,500
You have to feel it.

541
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,130
The...

542
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,170
The tissue plane along the parenchyma is smooth.

543
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,720
It should feel like gliding.

544
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,060
You've reached the amygdala.

545
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,530
Ready to begin thermal laser ablation.

546
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,740
Rose's upper GI and labs were normal.

547
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,700
Should we keep her another day to observe?

548
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,540
No. If she's stable, let's send her home.

549
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,540
- Okay, I'll have Olivia... - Open your mouth.

550
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,420
Pardon me?

551
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,340
Open your mouth.

552
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,470
- I can, uh... - Shut your mouth.

553
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,850
- There's this rat. - A mouse.

554
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,310
A little dead mouse in the garage,

555
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,560
and the big, strong man is afraid to get it out.

556
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,690
Not afraid, disgusted.

557
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,770
Neither of us wanna deal with it,

558
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,820
so we are settling it in the only responsible way, a bet.

559
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,070
A dare. A series of dares, actually.

560
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,530
Whoever wusses out first has to...

561
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,120
Take those things out of your mouth.

562
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,740
I will discharge Rose.

563
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,240
You two, go home.

564
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,070
- We were just... - Being idiots at work,

565
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,120
while people are sick and dying.

566
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,920
Go home.

567
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,760
All your tests are normal. We're discharging you.

568
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,680
Right, because you're psychic.

569
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,010
I'm an empath, not a psychic.

570
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,140
Whatever the case, I would suggest you take it easy.

571
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
No drinking, no heavy lifting...

572
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,060
You have to let it out, dear.

573
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,940
It was you.

574
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,730
You made my heart rate spike.

575
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,650
You're about to implode.

576
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,790
There's nothing wrong with you... or me.

577
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,750
Code blue!

578
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:22,990
Yeah?

579
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,910
Dr. Lim, my behavior yesterday

580
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,790
was inexcusable and unprofessional.

581
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,420
I let you down. I let the patient down.

582
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,460
I am deeply sorry.

583
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,720
And I promise it will not happen again.

584
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,470
You let your personal judgment get in the way of doing your job.

585
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,060
You're right. That is inexcusable.

586
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,360
You said I had no idea what the patient was going through.

587
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,190
The truth is I kinda do.

588
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,370
Scared, alone, afraid of anyone finding out.

589
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,330
I chose my career over motherhood,

590
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,080
over my faith.

591
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,960
But I don't regret it.

592
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,720
And I know God forgave me

593
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,550
because I get to be here,

594
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,850
living my dream of being a doctor.

595
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,980
But I purposely try not to think about it.

596
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,740
You're off scut duty.

597
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,660
That's not why I...

598
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,530
Take it.

599
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,460
My name is Benjamin Alan Harris.

600
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,510
I'm in St. Bonaventure Hospital in San Jose.

601
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,640
Language and memory appear to be intact,

602
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,680
and your motor function is normal.

603
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,220
But that doesn't mean it worked, does it?

604
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,060
No.

605
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,430
We'll have to do an fMRI

606
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,270
to see how you respond to fear-inducing stimuli.

607
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,230
But we'll let you rest for now.

608
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,190
I'm not gonna rest until I know I'm better.

609
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,900
I want you to know how I got these scars.

610
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,240
No. Not now.

611
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,900
Just give yourself time.

612
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:32,080
I was in a convoy in Kandahar.

613
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,750
I was in a Husky, the big vehicle at the front.

614
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,000
Ben, you don't have to do this.

615
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,250
Ronnie was driving.

616
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,380
He was telling me a story,

617
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,170
something about a goat at the base,

618
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,050
or maybe it was a chicken.

619
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:47,380
I don't know. But...

620
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,770
We were laughing.

621
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,190
Then the world was on fire.

622
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,240
It's the Husky's job

623
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,960
to spot IEDs.

624
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,340
And I missed one.

625
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,300
I can't see their faces.

626
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,850
Just

627
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,650
bodies everywhere.

628
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,190
Dying alone,

629
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,190
without their families.

630
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,780
All I could do was hold their hand.

631
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,710
Are you okay, Ben?

632
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:42,170
Happy birthday to you

633
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,130
Happy birthday to you

634
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,470
Happy birthday, dear Lea

635
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,840
Happy birthday to you

636
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,040
Fun day.

637
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,930
What do you need?

638
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,230
We have a diagnosis.

639
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
I thought I felt someone here.

640
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,410
You've had a long day.

641
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,840
You have Prinzmetal's Angina, Rose.

642
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,550
A heart condition. But it's very treatable.

643
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,300
It explains all your symptoms,

644
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,050
and it's exacerbated by stress,

645
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,590
which is likely what caused your heart attack.

646
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:40,770
You need to stop seeking out other people's pain.

647
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,060
It's literally killing you.

648
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,970
You're the Chief of Surgery.

649
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,690
You could have sent somebody else to tell me this.

650
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,360
Sure.

651
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,660
But then I'd miss my chance to gloat.

652
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,700
You're here because you're hurting

653
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,240
and you don't know where else to go.

654
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,250
Go ahead. Use your magic.

655
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,090
Tell me what's wrong with me.

656
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,510
How do I stop feeling like this?

657
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,010
It doesn't work that way.

658
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,260
I don't have a magic wand.

659
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,010
I can only hold up a mirror,

660
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,520
make you slow down,

661
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,690
look at the parts of yourself

662
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,770
that you've been trying to ignore

663
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,740
because you're afraid if you look too closely, you'll break.

664
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,870
Maybe you will. I don't know.

665
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,660
Maybe breaking is the point.

666
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,370
You can't outrun your pain, Dr. Lim.

667
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,750
If you keep trying, it's gonna kill you.
