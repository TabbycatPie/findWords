18
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,030
It's just a migraine.

19
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,160
Honey, until we're completely sure...

20
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,450
Is the pain a tight band or pulsating?

21
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,410
Good question.

22
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,080
Pulsating, light bothers me,

23
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,250
nausea -- I get these all the time.

24
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,000
You said you didn't feel a, uh...what'd you call it? A...

25
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,170
An "aura." I know, but --

26
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,090
Exactly how often do you get these symptoms?

27
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,430
I just ask, since your boyfriend doesn't seem to recognize them.

28
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,980
Zane and I have only known each other for eight days.

29
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,310
It moved fast.

30
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,150
Ellie, did you feel your foot twitch?

31
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,450
No.

32
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,620
Positive Babinski.

33
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,920
What does that mean?

34
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,340
It's not a migraine.

37
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,070
Oh, that.

38
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,910
I was performing due diligence on my new roommate,

39
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,330
who might be a violent maniac,

40
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,540
and look what I found in his closet.

41
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,710
It's cute.

42
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,420
You moved in with two suitcases.

43
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,750
You only have four pairs of underwear.

44
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,500
How the hell did a parrot make the cut?

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,210
I'm a Parrothead.

47
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,010
A Jimmy Buffett enthusiast.

48
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,340
The "Margaritaville" guy?

49
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,880
Well, he has other, far better songs,

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,680
but yes, the "Margaritaville" guy.

51
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,720
It brings me luck.

52
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,010
Scary to think what your life would be like without it.

53
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,430
Can I have it back?

54
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,230
It's fun getting to know you better.

55
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,150
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice.

56
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,120
I was demonstrating a torch lift this morning, and -- bang.

57
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,160
"Ballet master."

58
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,500
You're a dancer?

59
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,790
God, no. I'm like the CEO.

61
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,710
At my age, I'd be the Betty White of the troupe.

62
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,920
Is she a dancer?

63
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,880
I don't know much about, uh...culture.

64
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,260
I assume I just sprained something, right?

65
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,140
Uh, we will need neuro and abdominal exams,

66
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,310
X-rays for fractures,

67
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,680
CBC for infection,

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,270
cultures to rule out a spinal abscess --

69
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,400
You're...new, aren't you?

70
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Uh, it's my second week here.

71
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,070
It's actually only my first day seeing patients.

72
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,200
Am I your first?

73
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,370
Yes.

74
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,990
Sorry. But...yes.

75
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,750
That's impressive.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,380
Whoever's supervising you must really trust you.

77
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,710
I'm not sure that's true.

78
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,130
They won't let me join their stupid gym

79
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,890
because I had high blood pressure.

80
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,310
How am I supposed to lower it if I can't work out?

81
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,720
200 over 105.

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,270
That is quite high.

83
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,140
I just told you it was high.

84
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,400
Are you a smoker?

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,440
Yeah. Pack or two a day.

86
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,150
More if I feel crappy.

87
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,570
And...

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,490
do you have diabetes?

89
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,530
You're reading those questions out of a book?

90
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,530
Yes.

91
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,120
Have you ever done this before?

92
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,250
I told you. You have to trust them.

93
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,290
I don't.

94
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,290
Then act like you do.

95
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,880
Go away.

96
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,850
Nothing more romantic

97
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,180
than spending one of your first dates in an E.R.

98
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,730
Well, stressful experiences release oxytocin.

99
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,060
Same hormone that creates emotional bonds.

100
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,320
This might actually cement their relationship.

101
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,360
Next to the hippocampus.

102
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,030
Is that...a tooth?

103
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,410
Dermoid cyst. Cool.

104
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,280
She's having a seizure.

105
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,620
Secure her airway. Push two milligrams Ativan.

106
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,840
Thank you for trusting us enough --

107
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Please report.

108
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,380
Uh, 58-year-old male dancer with back pain.

109
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,720
I ruled out red flags like osteomyelitis

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,680
and kidney infection, but I did find evidence

111
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,310
of a mild L2 compression fracture with moderate wedging

112
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,060
and evidence of impingement on the neural canal.

113
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,770
You want to start beta blockers?

114
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:46,190
Me? Yeah. I think my patient's a stroke risk.

115
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,860
B.P.'s 200 over 105.

116
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,280
It was the same at her gym earlier?

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Can you raise your arms?

118
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,290
Okay. Now try to squeeze my hands.

119
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,580
I just did all these tests with her.

120
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,790
I thought you were gonna give me stuff

121
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,960
to lower my blood pressure.

122
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,130
That would kill you.

123
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,340
Now push against my hands.

124
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,180
If she's in danger of having a stroke --

125
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,090
She's not. She's already having one.

126
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,010
Smoking on estrogen put her at high risk.

127
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,850
Loss of circadian blood pressure variation confirms it.

128
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,020
Stick out your tongue.

129
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,020
We gotta get a CTA.

130
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,400
No. We're treating with IV TPA.

131
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,860
Don't we need to locate the clot?

132
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,860
We just did.

133
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,900
Right deviation means a right vertebral artery occlusion.

134
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,330
Oh. You can close your mouth now.

135
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,790
Her seizure and coma were caused by a dermoid cyst.

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,260
It's a pocket of tissue with bits of teeth, hair, and fat.

137
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,170
She likely got it before she was born.

138
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,220
What can you do?

139
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,010
The less invasive option is to put in a drain

140
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,220
to release some pressure,

141
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,310
treat with anti-seizure meds and steroids,

142
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,520
then basically watch to see if the swelling goes down.

143
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,940
And the more invasive?

144
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,230
Surgical removal.

145
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,150
But the cyst is deep inside

146
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,980
and wrapped around major arteries,

147
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,490
so it is more likely to fix the problem,

148
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,280
but it carries risk of stroke or paralysis.

149
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,700
We need a decision quickly.

150
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,710
Ellie's sister is on the paperwork,

151
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,540
but we haven't been able to reach her.

152
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,090
Do you know where the parents live or any other siblings?

153
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,640
He might still be on a business trip, but, uh...

154
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,970
...you can try her husband.

155
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,150
If we can't reduce the swelling,

156
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,320
she will have permanent brain damage.

157
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,370
Is that him?

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,750
Brendan, we need you to make a decision.

159
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,340
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,050
I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure that I'm the right one to...

161
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,140
I mean, right now...

162
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,810
I hate her.

163
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,390
You don't.

164
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,100
You're angry.

165
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,730
You're hurt.

166
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,230
Because you love her.

167
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,910
58-year-old male dancer with back pain.

168
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:54,670
Moderate vertebral wedging and impingement on the neural canal.

169
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,210
Yes. I think an L2 compression fracture.

170
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,800
Prescribe anti-inflammatories, a brace, and PT,

171
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,050
then discharge him.

172
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,730
Do you want to re-check anything?

173
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,060
No.

174
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:29,410
Remember to floss your brain after every meal, people.

175
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,620
Aspirating.

176
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,340
Do you think we should be doing this?

177
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,130
I know we have to legally,

178
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,590
but maybe her husband isn't the one who knows her best,

179
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,380
knows what she wants.

180
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,340
Better than the guy who met her last weekend.

181
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,260
Arachnoid knife.

182
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,970
Mm, that guy -- she's in love with him.

183
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,760
Apparently.

184
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,140
Well, maybe she loves them both.

185
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,810
Aren't you a romantic?

186
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,350
Watch for perforators.

187
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,810
I've been polyamorous for years.

188
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
When I was monogamous,

189
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,660
I was jealous, possessive, egotistical.

190
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,870
Our patient wasn't honest. That's not cool.

191
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,120
But other than that...

192
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,620
Good margins all around.

193
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,540
Let's dry up the field and close her up.

194
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,920
I never would have guessed I was your first patient.

195
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,260
Felt more like the fourth.

196
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,600
By the way, did I detect an accent?

197
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,260
No.

198
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,890
I mean, I had one, but I worked really hard to lose it.

199
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,400
No one ever notices it anymore.

200
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,400
Eastern Europe?

201
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,770
Brooklyn.

202
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,860
Williamsburg.

203
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,280
I grew up Hasidic, speaking Yiddish.

204
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,070
I left it a long time ago.

205
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,240
You left the -- the religion?

206
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,290
The religion, the culture...

207
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,660
my family.

208
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,790
Must not have been easy, growing up that way,

209
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,710
knowing you were...

210
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,750
a doctor.

211
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,920
Excuse me?

212
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,720
My generation, you could get bashed.

213
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,510
You could get thrown in jail.

214
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,020
We had to learn codes, how to read each other.

215
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,890
You should thank your lucky stars

216
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,810
you get to live your life the way you want it.

217
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,230
I don't know what you went through.

218
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,610
Please don't pretend to know what I went through.

219
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,160
Sir?

220
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,450
My gut...

221
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,880
Code blue!

222
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,880
The surgery seemed successful,

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,220
but we need to monitor for seizures over the next 24 hours.

224
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,390
Is this high enough?

225
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,890
Um, a little to the left.

226
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,720
No. To the right.

227
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,600
Yeah.

228
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,400
You never said anything was wrong.

229
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:06,360
Can we have the room for a moment?

230
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,650
I'm sorry, but we really need to check

231
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,410
You're worried about talking in front of them?

232
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,200
Embarrassing me?

233
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,670
I didn't think anything was wrong.

234
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,340
When I met Zane, it --

235
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,130
...made me realize something was missing.

236
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,930
Or, at least, I think that's what I'm feeling.

237
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,310
You mind tilting your chin up?

238
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,180
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,770
Why couldn't you just talk to me?

240
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,110
Or -- or...leave me?

241
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,730
I don't know.

242
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,620
Were you happy?

243
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,290
With him?

244
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,340
I guess I should go.

245
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,350
Brendan?

246
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,480
Who are these people?

247
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,730
Ellie, do you know where you are?

248
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,440
Why am I in the hospital?

249
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,660
Suprarenal aortic aneurysm.

250
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,200
It ruptured as he was being discharged.

251
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,580
Clamping aorta now.

252
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,710
How much blood is he down?

253
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,000
We suctioned out two liters

254
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,380
and gave six units on the rapid infuser.

255
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,800
The aneurysm caused his back pain.

256
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,420
Dr. Wolke missed it.

257
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,800
I did an abdominal exam.

258
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,590
Aneurysms are very hard to catch.

259
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,680
Experienced doctors miss them all the time.

260
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,470
Potts scissors.

261
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:01,100
The aneurysm is 6.5 centimeters.

262
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,770
Dr. Wolke should have felt it.

263
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,610
It felt like... normal musculature.

264
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,820
I-I'm so sorry.

265
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,320
We'll never know what you felt.

266
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,320
There's no way to know if you, or any doctor, for that matter,

267
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,620
would have detected this.

268
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,870
I would have.

269
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,950
He asked me - if I wanted to double-check.

270
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,620
If I had, I would have caught the aneurysm before the rupture.

271
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,500
Stop it.

272
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,130
He made a mistake.

273
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,470
He might have.

274
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,630
But you did, too.

275
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,180
No. You told me to back off.

276
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,680
I didn't tell you to abdicate responsibility.

277
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:47,060
When a First Year asks if you want to re-check their work,

278
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,400
your answer should always be yes.

279
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,280
The fact they're asking is a warning sign.

280
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,330
I didn't know that.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,840
It's called retrograde memory loss.

282
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,670
Luckily, it seems to have been temporary.

283
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,880
She's lucid again.

284
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,840
We're running an MRI and lab tests

285
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,180
to see what caused it.

286
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,310
Thank you for, uh, telling me. I know I'm just the...

287
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,470
You care.

288
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,440
Maybe things with Ellie and I weren't always perfect, but --

289
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,480
It was exciting.

290
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
When I was with her...

291
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,660
never felt that way before.

292
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,030
I took care of her when she was sick.

293
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,740
I never strayed.

294
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,410
It wasn't about the things we did.

295
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,750
It was -- it was about...

296
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,420
being with her.

297
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,460
She stuck by me when I needed her.

298
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,630
Last year, I was -- I was drinking way too much.

299
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
It's hard to imagine being without her.

300
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,850
I just can't imagine being without her.

301
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,030
She's stable.

302
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,070
Q-hour neuro exams and monitor for signs of elevated ICP.

303
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,250
I believe you're getting a call, Dr. Park.

304
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,670
You're a Parrothead. Wear it proud.

305
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,130
Can we just agree to have some limits?

306
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,550
Maybe not everything I own is fair game.

307
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,640
No.

308
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,140
Perfect.

309
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,010
Trust me, it'll be worth every damn bit of sacrifice.

310
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,980
I've said that twice now.

311
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,150
You've said a lot of things twice. You have limited creativity.

312
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,480
Truth is, it wasn't creative at all.

313
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
It's from Jimmy Buffett's "Cheeseburger in Paradise,"

314
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,860
one of his "Big Eight," so big, even I know it.

315
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,030
You, sir, are no Parrothead.

316
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,530
Mia does woodwork as a side hustle.

317
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,620
She made it for me on our first trip to Hawaii.

318
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,450
Lovely.

319
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,790
Wait. No, that's not right.

320
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,620
"Pathetic"?

321
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,170
And do you toss away all mementos of

322
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,290
past friends and jobs?

323
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,380
If a job cheated on me, I might want to move on.

324
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,050
When's the last time you dated someone?

325
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,840
When's the last time you acted like a human being?

326
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,340
So, years?

327
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,050
Yeah, I definitely found the right word.

328
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,470
See you at home.

330
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,150
You can't sleep?

331
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,900
You want some warm milk?

332
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,740
My mother has, like, 18 "prescriptions" for this.

333
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,110
Some of them are actual prescriptions.

334
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,820
I can sleep

335
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,280
but need to figure out how to supervise better.

336
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,790
How many of these are you planning to read tonight?

337
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,160
Just the relevant sections of each.

338
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,290
Tech bros are always watching TED Talks on leadership.

339
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,170
That could be quicker than those books.

340
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,550
How about tomorrow, we have a date night?

341
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,600
Why would we need a date night

342
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,930
if we're in a relationship and living together?

343
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,520
Because it'll be fun.

344
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,060
I'll schedule date night for tomorrow.

345
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,400
Great. Think of something for us to do.

346
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,190
There is one thing that helps most people sleep

347
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,820
that my mother did not tell me about.

348
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,040
What makes a great manager?

349
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,710
Some say it's all about planning.

350
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,040
Others, charismatic leadership.

351
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,340
A third group --

352
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,050
Your temporary memory loss was caused by some fat

353
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,720
that leaked from your cyst.

354
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,930
We can remove it via a craniotomy,

355
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,180
but there is a real risk of more memory loss.

356
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,890
Maybe permanently.

357
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,230
What will I lose?

358
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,560
The time prior to the surgery.

359
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,860
Days, weeks, possibly months.

360
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,820
But if we don't operate soon,

361
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,690
the risk of brain damage only grows.

362
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,450
I can't do it.

363
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,870
I don't even know what I want right now,

364
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,130
but I do know that I don't want the decision about my marriage

365
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,000
forced on me by an operation.

366
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:24,920
Please...

367
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,180
find another answer.

368
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,150
You are not very good at your jobs,

369
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,650
and I'm not very good at teaching you,

370
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,570
so we are going to focus on one step at a time.

371
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,400
You will master each skill separately.

372
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
I've made a list of 400 skills.

373
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,990
I didn't have the time to finish it last night because --

374
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,790
Dr. Wolke, you will be focusing on physical exams.

375
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,620
You will find a list of the seven post-op tests

376
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,660
to be conducted on Carl.

377
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,710
Dr. Jackson, you will find relevant seminars

378
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,790
on conquering nerves in the workplace.

379
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,630
What are good activities for a date?

380
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,210
what does she like?

381
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,840
Cars, coding, "Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"

382
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,840
Sauvignon Blanc, Skittles, "RuPaul's Drag Race,"

383
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,720
camping...

384
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,100
I had a very romantic time camping in Big Sur.

385
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,560
This is for tonight.

386
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,690
I haven't gone on many dates.

387
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,730
But everyone loves movies.

388
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,620
Healing nicely.

389
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,920
No redness or swelling.

390
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,880
I'm gonna palpate around it now.

391
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,840
Look, I need to apologize.

392
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,850
For bringing up your personal life the other day.

393
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,060
No.

394
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,850
You have nothing to apologize to me for.

395
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,690
So...what's next on your list?

396
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,950
Checking for signs of infection inside your abdomen.

397
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,830
Open your eyes wider.

398
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,080
You have signs of jaundice.

399
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,420
I think your liver's failing.

400
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,090
The liver is being damaged by a new aneurysm.

401
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,550
How? A genetic predisposition or --

402
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,560
More likely, when we fixed the first one,

403
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
we increased the pressure upstream.

404
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,850
Can we stent the celiac?

405
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,230
Anatomy's too tricky.

406
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,860
Aortic to celiac bypass?

407
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,690
We'd just risk a new aneurysm forming upstream.

408
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,070
Maybe, but it solves the problem in front of us.

409
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,490
He'll die without an intervention.

410
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,910
He'll probably die either way.

411
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,760
Let's all take the time to research alternate solutions.

412
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,310
If we can't come up with something better in 24 hours,

413
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,870
we proceed with the bypass.

414
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,730
She's saying no for emotional reasons.

415
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,380
So the answer isn't medical.

416
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,570
It's emotional.

417
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,760
We think... Zane should talk to Ellie.

418
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,750
No.

419
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,440
I don't want him anywhere near her.

420
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,750
To convince her to do the craniotomy.

421
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,390
From you, it's self-serving.

422
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,010
From Zane...

423
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,820
Wait. If she doesn't want it --

424
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,670
You said you can't imagine life without her.

425
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,290
If you meant that, you'd risk anything to keep her alive.

426
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,930
Including her memories of you.

427
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,980
Well done, Shaunnie.

428
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,920
I really needed this.

429
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,920
The system update yesterday?

430
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,110
Went bananas.

431
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,750
I've been flooded with complaints.

432
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,150
Total nightmare.

433
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,790
How's work? Did the videos help?

434
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,570
Yes.

435
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,710
Tell me more.

436
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,610
One of my patients developed a secondary aneurysm.

437
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,980
Now I need to find a surgical fix by tomorrow.

438
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,900
Otherwise, he will probably die.

439
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,410
I brought Skittles.

440
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,600
- Shouldn't you be at the hospital? - Yes.

441
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,170
After you go to bed,

442
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,690
I plan to go back and do research.

443
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,250
Shaunnie... go to the hospital.

444
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,810
No, we made this schedule.

445
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,860
Someone else needs you.

446
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,380
More than I need you.

447
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,610
It's a hospital.

448
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,250
It's filled with sick people.

449
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,900
But tomorrow, will someone need you

450
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,250
to come up with a way to save their life?

451
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,820
Maybe.

452
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,630
Probably not tomorrow.

453
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,600
Okay.

454
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,030
I am canceling date night.

455
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,250
That's rude.

456
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,240
Oh, well.

457
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,840
Then...

458
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,260
I should...

459
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,850
go to the hospital.

460
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,700
They're prepping Ellie for surgery.

461
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,180
Any last-minute questions?

462
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,870
What should I do?

463
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,280
Forgive her.

464
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,020
Under the right circumstances, every human will stray.

465
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,290
We're not hardwired for monogamy.

466
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,120
I'm guessing you're not married.

467
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,810
I'm not saying that it's wrong to feel angry.

468
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,970
She wasn't honest with you.

469
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,800
The alternative to forgiving her is losing someone that you love.

470
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,110
Then what?

471
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,740
If she comes back to me just because she forgets him...

472
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,070
...my marriage wouldn't be honest.

473
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,460
I have an idea.

474
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,730
We could remove more proximal aorta

475
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,340
and extend the graft.

476
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,390
And rebuild the celiac trunk with what?

477
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,570
Dacron?

478
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,180
Branches are too complex.

479
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,100
This Lancet article on polymer materials...

480
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,770
doesn't work.

481
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,280
But thin-film nitinol?

482
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,160
Did we break him?

483
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,310
We have the material.

484
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,040
It's his veins.

485
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

486
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,240
Did we reestablish personal boundaries?

487
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,310
This morning's presentation's on...who's not moving on?

488
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,060
Exhibit A.

489
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,990
Canoodling on - a very romantic hillside with --

490
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,250
With my gay best friend. Can you leave?

491
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,390
Exhibit B.

492
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,340
A xxl Rob Gronkowski jersey.

493
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,080
Just the latest fashion style

494
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,450
from a woman who hates the Patriots?

495
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,650
Or an ex-boyfriend's --

496
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,610
Not an ex. I hooked up with Gronk.

497
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,270
Seemed worth preserving.

498
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,870
Rob? Or one of his brothers?

499
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,690
Props. I guess.

500
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,750
Exhibit infinitum --

501
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,150
two ticket stubs to "Quantum of Solace."

502
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,800
Now, you once called Daniel Craig "James Blonde,"

503
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,370
and yet 11 years later, these were in your drawer,

504
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,780
on top of an instruction manual for a 2019 cellphone,

505
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,150
which means you dug them out within the last year.

506
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,790
Why?

507
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,200
I can only assume you are currently

508
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,460
once again hooking up with the James Blonde fan.

509
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,370
How could you possible deduce --

510
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,840
I also read your e-mails.

511
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,040
You've been sleeping with an ex

512
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,300
without asking for any commitment.

513
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,450
It's just sex. It's not keeping me from anything.

514
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,790
What's more likely to prevent someone from moving on?

515
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,750
A parrot in a drawer or an ex in your bed?

516
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,340
I'm at least getting something hot from the situation.

517
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,250
You're just wallowing in failure.

518
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,240
So, if your bag's empty,

519
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,570
I'm naked and have to go to the bathroom.

520
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,670
It's called a Y-shaped vein graft.

521
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,630
Your aorta is damaged from the aneurysm

522
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,940
right where it branches off.

523
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,950
We're gonna find a vein in your leg that's similar in size,

524
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,480
cut it out, and use it to replace the damaged artery.

525
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,650
How bad is it?

526
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,530
This is an excellent solution.

527
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,000
If it works.

528
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,220
What are the actual chances that it doesn't --

529
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,110
that I'm gonna die?

530
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,410
I don't want to give a number.

531
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,120
I mean, I can't.

532
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,780
I literally can't. There are too many factors.

533
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,900
I can call in Dr. Murphy --

534
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't need to hear numbers.

535
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,700
How bad is this?

536
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,970
Bad.

537
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,350
Thank you.

538
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,450
Whatever happens, you're gonna be an incredible doctor.

539
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:33,310
And I am honored to have been your first patient.

540
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,580
I screwed up.

541
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,190
That first exam.

542
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,850
I felt something.

543
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,910
I should have known it was an aneurysm.

544
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,260
We could have saved you before it got bad.

545
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,800
Why...?

546
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,790
You were my first patient.

547
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,080
I need you to do something for me.

548
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,340
I need you to pray.

549
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,490
You must know a prayer for the sick.

550
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,560
I'm not a believer anymore.

551
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,270
Neither am I.

552
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,630
But...

553
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,680
Yehi rutsoyn milfuneykhu adoynoy eloyhay

554
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,040

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,720
Ayl nu refu nu loy.

558
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,280
Ellie, do you know these men?

559
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,320
Of course.

560
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,660
Brendan.

561
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,430
And --

562
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,780
And are...you a friend of Brendan's?

563
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,230
Something like that.

564
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,700
A lot has happened in the last week.

565
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,490
So before you went under, the doctors made a video.

566
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,790
It's sort of a-a message

567
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,650
from your old self to your new one.

568
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,360
I just want you to know...

569
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,910
that I love you.

570
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,770
Tell me about the day you met.

571
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,080
I was in the middle of an art exhibit in SoMa,

572
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,400
and I noticed this guy, and he was...

573
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,920
was looking at all the same paintings I had been looking at...

574
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,200
Need another 6-0 loaded backhand for the arterial stump.

575
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,280
Graft is secure.

576
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,010
Take off the Satinsky clamp.

577
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,310
Good perfusion to his lower body.

578
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,030
Heart rate's spiking.

579
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,560
There's no ST elevations.

580
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,480
B.P.'s tanking. Did he thrombose the graft?

581
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,690
Distal anastomosis is pulsatile.

582
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,140
But there is blood pooling in the left lower quadrant.

583
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,840
He's bleeding everywhere but the graft.

584
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,060
It's DIC.

585
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,080
Send a stat ROTEM and coag profile --

586
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,380
Start compression, give epinephrine, and get the defib.

587
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,090
- Set it to 120. - 120.

588
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,290
Clear.

589
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,530
Compressions.

590
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,030
No response.

591
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,150
Go to monophasic at 360.

592
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,670
Clear.

593
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,260
Why aren't you shocking again?!

594
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,560
He's in asystole.

595
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,340
Dr. Lim?

596
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,380
Dr. Wolke.

597
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,370
He's dead.

598
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,190
Time of death -- 7:23 P.M.

599
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,870
Take as much time as you need.

600
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,040
I was in love with him.

601
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,140
All those moments I had --

602
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,080
meeting at the gallery, the conversations...

603
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,590
I don't remember any of them.

604
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,920
But they were real.

605
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,970
And they brought up feelings.

606
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,570
Ones I don't remember having for a really long time.

607
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,510
But all they made me think of was you, Brendan.

608
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,670
Hearing how I met Zane just reminded me

609
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,780
how you and I met at Chelsey's party,

610
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,310
and you showed up in that ugly bomber jacket.

611
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,530
And Zane taking me to the hospital

612
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,810
reminded me how you nursed me for months

613
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,800
when I broke my femur in Aspen.

614
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,200
And the whole time...

615
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,620
...I just couldn't stop thinking about

616
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,090
how much I must have hurt you.

617
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,550
And I d--

618
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,450
I don't know if...

619
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,480
you can forgive me.

620
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:29,090
But I love you.

621
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,660
And I -- I want to come home.

622
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,570
Well, you're wrong.

623
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,890
That bomber jacket was really cool.

624
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,740
He died.

625
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,100
I tried stepping back.

626
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,330
I tried brainstorming.

627
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,710
And he died.

628
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,080
I don't know what people are thinking or feeling.

629
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,460
I can't communicate what I need.

630
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,880
And more patients will die.

631
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,710
You don't think your ASD had anything to do

632
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:26,500
with your patient's death, do you?

633
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,760
Because it didn't.

634
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:33,710
Asher wasn't sure about his abdominal exam.

635
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,040
I should have known that.

636
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,540
Shaun, you're gonna do most things

637
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,700
better than anyone else,

638
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:47,550
and there are days when you're gonna fail, like everyone else.

639
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,580
Today might be one of those days.

640
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,470
So...

641
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,650
...what do you do then?

642
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,980
You go home, you...

643
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,470
be with the people you love.

644
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,100
You take comfort in that,

645
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,020
and then you wake up tomorrow and start all over again.

646
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,030
You can go home.

647
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,010
I just...

648
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,770
...don't want to be alone right now.

649
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,500
I opened a Bumble account today.

650
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,000
I swiped right three times today.

652
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,200
Gronk's jersey didn't have a tag in the back.

653
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,170
It's symbolic.

654
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,740
You have any idea how much the real one will be worth one day?

655
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,430
Fair enough.

656
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,160
Wastin' away again in Margaritaville.

657
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:11,090
Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt.

658
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,960
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame.

659
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,880
But I know,

660
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,590
- It's my own damn fault.  - Damn fault

661
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,780
I'm glad you're here with me.

662
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,570
So am I.
