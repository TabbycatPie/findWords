13
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,400
My name is Barry Allen,

14
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,260
and I am the fastest man alive.

15
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,990
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

16
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,880
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

17
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,150
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

18
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,390
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

19
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,960
but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats,

20
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,070
and I am the only one fast enough to stop them.

21
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,690
I am The Flash.

22
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,640
Previously on "The Flash"...

23
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,920
Zoom wants you dead.

24
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,100
Do you think he can do everything really fast?

25
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,550
- How you doing, Dig? - You're fast.

26
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,600
Welcome to Earth-2.

27
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,300
Dad!

28
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,760
No! No!

29
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,430
Caitlin. That is your name, isn't it?

30
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,570
I hate the name Caitlin. I'm Killer Frost.

31
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,650
Ronnie and Caitlin's doppelgangers are evil?

32
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,480
If you're coming with us, we have to go.

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,710
Cisco!

34
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,180
Get ready to close the breach for good,

35
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,350
Zoom's coming.

36
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,140
No!

37
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,800
He's not dead. He's not dead.

38
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,020
Caitlin

39
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,030
He's not dead. He's not.

40
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,470
- Caitlin. - This isn't happening.

41
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,190
This isn't happening again.

42
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,710
Hey, I got you.

43
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,050
Come on.

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,420
- Open it up. - Allen...

45
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,000
- I need to go back. - I can't do that.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,810
- Open it up! - Allen!

47
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,760
The breaches are closed.

48
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,420
All the breaches are closed.

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,310
Why can't we just open one of 'em?

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,620
The Quark Matter energy that we used to seal the breaches,

51
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,590
it prevents them from being opened, ever again.

52
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,340
There's no going back to our world.

53
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,900
Wait.

54
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,280
We're trapped here for good?

55
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,650
Yes.

56
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,740
No, we can't just let Zoom get away with this.

57
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,700
He just murdered Jay right in front of us.

58
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,390
There's got to be something we can do.

59
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,570
There's not.

60
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,540
Not this time.

61
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,510
It's over.

62
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,360
No.

65
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,030
How's she doing?

66
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,740
Not good. We tried to get her to go home,

67
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,430
but she refused to leave, so, you know,

68
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,260
I just sat with her until she fell asleep.

69
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,990
First Ronnie, now Jay.

70
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,690
Yeah.

71
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,590
I'm afraid what this double dose of grief is gonna do to her.

72
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,250
I mean, she's pretty shell-shocked.

73
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,610
She'll be fine.

74
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:09,580
Snow's strong. She'll get past this.

75
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,870
But in the meantime, I would not say anything to her

76
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,010
about her counterpart from my Earth.

77
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,150
That goes for Joe and Iris too.

78
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,280
Why?

79
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,910
Because you don't want to influence their reality

80
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,530
in ways that should not be influenced.

81
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,050
Like in the same way as when Barry time-travels?

82
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,680
Exactly, but also,

83
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,340
what's the point?

84
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,350
Those people are not your people.

85
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,240
Their lives are not your lives.

86
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,030
Never were, never will be.

87
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,990
Bury it. Move on.

88
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,490
Yes?

89
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,340
Yeah. That I can do.

90
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,800
Allen?

91
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,000
So that's what we did.

92
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,540
We didn't talk about Earth-2.

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,970
We kept what happened there between the three of us

94
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,960
and got on with our lives

95
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,120
knowing there was nothing we could do now to stop Zoom.

96
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,640
Instead, we tried to just adjust to our new circumstances

97
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,480
and cope with our losses.

98
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,230
Jay's death took its toll...

99
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,550
left scars on all of us, some more than others.

100
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,410
And so to try and keep my mind

101
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,300
off thoughts of the surreal other life

102
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,170
I experienced that wasn't my own,

103
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,850
I kept running,

104
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,920
waiting for some other meta-human threat to rear its ugly head

105
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,350
and distract me from the frustration I was feeling,

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,110
and as fate would have it,

108
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,610
I did not have to wait long.

109
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,530
All good.

110
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,160
Hey, ugly! It's time for dinner.

111
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,530
I think Bruce has gone belly up.

112
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,630
Power down the grid.

113
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,020
We're gonna have to fish him out.

114
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,950
So this is where Waller kept all her secret projects, huh?

115
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,940
One of many sites, I'm learning.

116
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,750
I'm sure the new director of A.R.G.U.S. will clean up

117
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,470
the mess that Waller left behind.

118
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,500
Easier said than done, honey.

119
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,890
My wife can do anything she puts her mind to.

120
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,100
Code seven in aquaria three.

121
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,500
I repeat, code seven in aquaria three.

122
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,560
There is a breach in the aquarium!

123
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,250
You have an aquarium? Why?

124
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,790
What the hell?

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,220
Are you kidding me?

126
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,000
Seven, six, five,

127
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,900
four, three, two, one.

128
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,520
- Yes! - Time.

129
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,380
Ain't nobody faster than me.

130
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,360
I don't know about that.

131
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,430
Earth to Barry.

132
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,460
It's your turn, dude.

133
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,680
Yeah, it's time to show this little punk

134
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,390
who the fastest stack attacker alive is.

135
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,610
One of you guys go ahead. I'm gonna pass.

136
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,070
You're afraid of a little competition?

137
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,400
No, just not in a gaming mood right now.

138
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,620
Okay, well, I guess that makes me champ.

139
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,440
Right?

140
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,360
Anyway, I'm gonna go meet up with some friends.

141
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,380
All right.

142
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,750
- Bye. - Bye.

143
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,320
Maybe next time.

144
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,910
And I thought you were the competitive one in the family.

145
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:38,460
I know, right? What's up, Bar?

146
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,690
Nothing. Just--

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,060
I don't know, I don't think Wally likes me too much.

148
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,740
Well, we need to fix that.

149
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,420
I mean, you been so busy running between alternate realities,

150
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,710
you two haven't had a chance to spend any time together.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,250
What you want us to do together?

152
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,060
Get to know each other,

153
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,680
find something that you guys have in common.

154
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,560
He's part of the family now, Bar.

155
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,530
You're gonna have to give it a chance.

156
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,610
I know.

157
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,190
All right, well, look, I'm gonna head to bed, all right?

158
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,590
- Good night. - Good night.

159
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,330
Something is up with him,

160
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,520
and I don't think it's just Jay's death.

161
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,900
He's been acting weird ever since he came back from Earth-2.

162
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,690
Did he say anything to you about what happened over there?

163
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,370
No, not a thing. You?

164
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,390
Hey, so... I been thinking.

165
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,610
You've been working around the clock.

166
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,270
Maybe you want to get some rest, go home.

167
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,200
You know, a good night's sleep

168
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,880
wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

169
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,940
I'm fine.

170
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,420
Look, I get it.

171
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,290
You're having a hard time with what happened.

172
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,060
It's a lot to take so soon after--

173
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,280
I said I'm fine.

174
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,980
Did you hear that?

175
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,390
No, what?

176
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,100
Caitlin just bit my head off.

177
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,340
She's been all business, no emotion lately.

178
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,880
She's been...cold.

179
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,580
Cold?

180
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,370
Come on, Cisco.

181
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,540
This could be the beginning of her becoming evil.

182
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,670
You're not worried about that?

183
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,750
I'm not worried about that.

184
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,580
Caitlin's not gonna become Killer Frost.

185
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,960
You haven't mentioned anything about about Earth-2, have you?

186
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,070
No, 'cause I know how to keep a secret.

187
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,530
All right, well, look, I mean, it's gonna take some time

188
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,700
for her to heal.

189
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,490
We just got to be there for her, keep her busy.

190
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,000
That shouldn't be a problem.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,180
Oh. Hey, Dig, Lyla.

192
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,510
What are you guys doing here?

193
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,630
We came to give you the head's up, Barry.

194
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,220
About what?

195
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,280
A meta-human who escaped from A.R.G.U.S. Custody,

196
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,910
goes by the name King Shark.

197
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,310
King Shark?

198
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,630
You mean the half-man/half-shark that tried to kill you months ago.

199
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,760
I thought he was dead.

200
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,130
That's what A.R.G.U.S. wanted you to believe

201
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,370
when they snatched him up,

202
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,830
but believe me, this half-shark is very much alive,

203
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,520
and his biological imperative is telling him to do one thing.

204
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,380
That's kill you, Barry.

205
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,270
We're gonna need a bigger Flash.

206
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,600
So how do you know about King Shark?

207
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,320
Well, as the new director of A.R.G.U.S.,

208
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,910
Lyla's job is to clean up Amanda Waller's messes.

209
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,120
King Shark was one of the bigger and weirder ones.

210
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,650
And it appears under her directives,

211
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,720
A.R.G.U.S. had been monitoring meta-human activity

212
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,970
for the past two years.

213
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,640
Why?

214
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,500
Well, to see if any of those powers could be exploited.

215
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,790
Weaponized.

216
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,170
How do you know that he's coming after me?

217
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,070
While in our custody, he kept saying the same thing.

218
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,330
"Zoom wants the Flash dead"

219
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,990
And although he removed the tracker we had in him,

220
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,110
the readings we did receive show that he was

221
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,240
headed towards Central City.

222
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,370
Let him come.

223
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,500
Barry, this thing is a killing machine.

224
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,140
We just came here to warn you, man.

225
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,130
Let A.R.G.U.S. handle it.

226
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,500
Nah, I can't do that, Dig.

227
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,300
I'm sorry, but all year, we've been sitting ducks

228
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,290
for Zoom and his Earth-2 henchmen.

229
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,610
This is the last one.

230
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm not gonna just wait for him to attack.

231
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,490
I'm going after him first. I owe that to Jay.

232
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,920
Wells, he's from your earth.

233
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,180
What do you know about him?

234
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,030
Real name, Shay Lamden, he was a--

235
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,670
get this--marine biologist

236
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,390
before my particle accelerator changed him into King Shark,

237
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,200
and Zoom put him under his control.

238
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,580
So how did you track him when he attacked Barry?

239
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,770
Zoom sent him to this earth to kill Barry.

240
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,490
I just followed.

241
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,790
Yeah, but you did track Grodd down.

242
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,260
Can you find King Shark too?

243
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,890
I can try.

244
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:35,880
All right.

245
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,590
Okay, well, all these locations are next to a body of water.

246
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:42,620
There must only be a few hours

247
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,160
before he needs to get back into the water

248
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,930
to re-oxygenate his blood.

249
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,240
I can take the Waterfront.

250
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
Can you have your team handle the rest?

251
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,940
- I'll get them on it. - All right.

252
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,300
What about Dr. Lamden's doppelganger?

253
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,950
Maybe he could help us somehow.

254
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,200
Or not.

255
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,490
Looks like he died when the particle accelerator exploded.

256
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,980
What about next of kin?

257
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,560
He's got a widow, Doctor Tanya Lamden.

258
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,600
She's a research scientist at Nautilus Labs,

259
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,710
And she studies-- wait for it--sharks.

260
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,750
Maybe the two of you can go and see

261
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,360
if she's discovered anything in her research that could help us.

262
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,360
- Okay. - Sure.

263
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,810
Great.

264
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,790
- Hey, Digg. - Yeah?

265
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,870
How's that helmet treating you?

266
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,210
Could use some improvements.

267
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,680
I'll get to work on it.

268
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,240
Hey, Joe, what's up?

269
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,280
Hey, Bar, I talked to Wally,

270
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,480
He wants to meet up with you.

271
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,240
All right.

272
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,650
He's working on his engineering project at our place tonight.

273
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,960
He would love some help from that big brain of yours.

274
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,220
Okay, Joe, look, I'm sorry,

275
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,840
Right now is kind of a crazy time.

276
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,150
What? What's going on?

277
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,040
Remember that meta-human shark

278
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,170
that Patty was after and attacked me?

279
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:43,760
He's back?

280
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,290
I thought Wells--you know.

281
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,150
Yeah, me too,

282
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,700
but apparently, A.R.G.U.S. had him

283
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,180
and he escaped, and now he's heading for Central City.

284
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,860
I get it.

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,420
I'll tell Wally some other time.

286
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,200
Hey, you know what?

287
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,230
It's all good, I'll make it work.

288
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,310
Tell him tonight should be fine.

289
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,490
Are you sure?

290
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,260
- Yeah. - Thanks, Bar.

291
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,540
Yeah, bye.

292
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,650
Why?

294
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,160
It's been two years since your particle accelerator exploded.

295
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,980
Seems a little late to be asking questions about my husband,

296
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,980
doesn't it?

297
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,640
Your husband passed away from cancer, correct?

298
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,690
I suppose you could say that.

299
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,530
It only took three days for every cell in his body

300
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,910
to grow uncontrollably.

301
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,440
Whatever cancer he had, it turned him into something...

302
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,730
not human.

303
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,530
Well, that's why we're here, actually.

304
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,170
There's a meta-human in Central City

305
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,700
whose body seems to be mutating

306
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,070
in the same way as your late husband,

307
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,110
but he didn't die, he became a dangerous monster.

308
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,360
My husband was no monster.

309
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
That's not what she was implying.

310
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,150
What does this have to do with me?

311
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,680
We've read about the research you're doing here on sharks.

312
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,650
Yeah, I've had some encouraging results,

313
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,400
although still preliminary.

314
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,090
We need to see it.

315
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,600
I beg your pardon?

316
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,660
Your research, all of it.

317
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,530
What my colleague means to say is that

318
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,110
if you could please let us take a look at your findings,

319
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,720
it could help us stop this meta-human from hurting anyone.

320
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,920
You're with S.T.A.R. Labs. I'm just supposed to trust you?

321
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,130
Please, Mrs. Lamden.

322
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,120
This could help save lives.

323
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,820
I'll email you what I have.

324
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,100
Thank you.

325
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,200
- Little harsh. - I was being direct.

326
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,540
Yeah, well, that's one way to describe it.

327
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,320
You've been acting differently toward me

328
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,170
ever since you got back from Earth-2.

329
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,350
What's your problem, Cisco?

330
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,950
Nothing.

331
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,860
Let's just go.

332
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,030
Grid one, negative.

333
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,660
Grid four, negative.

334
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,540
Status check, grid two.

335
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,850
Grid two, negative.

336
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,920
Anything?

337
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,260
No, man, nothing yet.

338
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,010
Yeah, so far, nothing on our end either.

339
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,070
Let's just hope Wells is doing better than we are.

340
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,660
Hey, how's Felicity doing?

341
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,230
Well, I'm not gonna lie, Barry,

342
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,620
it was pretty rough there at first, but

343
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,220
you know Felicity, she's tough.

344
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,730
Yeah, she's just not returning any of my calls.

345
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,910
She has a lot going on right now.

346
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,650
Buddy, I'll ask if she can give you a call

347
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,840
when this is all over.

348
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,600
Just want to catch this thing, man,

349
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,130
have everything to do with Zoom and Earth-2 put behind us,

350
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,710
so we can just move on with our lives.

351
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,060
Starting to do that thing Oliver does, Barry,

352
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,640
carry the weight of the world on your shoulders.

353
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,740
Got to stop that, man, it's gonna slow you down.

354
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,740
Still nothing.

355
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,970
Status check, grid six.

356
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,740
Hold on, I think we got something.

357
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,550
So much for cleaning up after Waller's messes.

358
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,800
We don't find King Shark soon,

359
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,880
someone's gonna be cleaning up after mine.

360
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,780
We'll find him, Lyla.

361
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,200
All right, I searched the whole area.

362
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,280
He's gone.

363
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,610
Couldn't have gotten far.

364
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,360
Still, he knows we're here now.

365
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,510
We lost the element of surprise.

366
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,300
Not if Wells can figure out a way to track him.

367
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,220
In the meantime, we'll keep looking.

368
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,000
All right, I'll meet up with you guys later.

369
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,880
I got to go see Joe's son.

370
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,420
Okay, I thought our relationship was hard to follow.

371
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,570
See ya.

372
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,780
He's fast, John, get over it.

373
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,210
Never.

374
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,170
Joe thought I should have you take a look.

375
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,780
So, this is what I got so far for my project essay

376
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,000
to get into CCU's engineering program.

379
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,610
Turbine supercars?

380
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,060
Turbines? Like jet engines?

381
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,270
Yeah, yeah, it'd use an engine like the ones they have

382
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,220
in some helicopters, only it'd run on biodiesel.

383
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,780
- Cool. - It's very cool.

384
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,400
Yeah, you're gonna want to address

385
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,750
the fuel economy issue here.

386
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,020
It is a jet, so it's gonna burn through a lot of fuel.

387
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,480
Yeah, that's why I want to use biodiesel.

388
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,400
It'll run off of anything that burns with oxygen.

389
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,450
No, okay, but you also got a sound issue.

390
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,810
Gonna wake the neighbors...

391
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,090
for sure.

392
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,160
Anything else?

393
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,370
Well, I just... want to help, you know.

394
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,080
I'm just trying to make sure

395
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,440
they don't have any reason to say no.

396
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,900
Okay.

397
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,060
Sorry, Wally, I didn't mean that--

398
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,860
It looks really good.

399
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,190
All right, let's start over, okay?

400
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,100
Is it--

401
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,090
Why don't we go through it all together, work it out?

402
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,780
Sounds good.

403
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,710
Cool.

404
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,440
This is a complete waste of time.

405
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,550
We're not gonna find anything in Doctor Lamden's research

406
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,510
to tell us how to find King Shark.

407
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,650
Maybe I should take a look.

408
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,490
Oh, yeah, 'cause you're the doctor with a specialty in bio-chem.

409
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,650
I'm just saying maybe you could use

410
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,760
another set of eyes, considering.

411
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,250
Considering what?

412
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,130
Considering the way you've been acting lately.

413
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,570
What does that mean?

414
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,470
You are not yourself, Caitlin,

415
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,660
And it's freaking me out,

416
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,150
'cause you have this icy look in your eye

417
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,650
just like you did over there.

418
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,420
Over there?

419
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,520
You mean Earth-2?

420
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,410
No. Uh, no.

421
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,340
Um, what I meant to say was--

422
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,260
You met my doppelganger, didn't you?

423
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,830
What? No.

424
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,200
Cisco.

425
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,450
Look, I'm not supposed to say anything.

426
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,140
Why not?

427
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,500
Because I'm not supposed to say anything.

428
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,890
Francisco Ramon, if you don't start talking--

429
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:27,960
Okay, fine, yes, I met your doppelganger.

430
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,840
She's a coldhearted Ice Queen named Killer Frost,

431
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,510
a meta-human who enjoyed killing a lot.

432
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,460
There, great.

433
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,120
Now Harry's gonna kill me and throw myself across the room.

434
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,740
Cisco, I'm not a meta-human.

435
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,950
Okay, I hear you, but you're acting

436
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,540
just like she did over there.

437
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,690
You're being shut off. You're being detached.

438
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,500
You're being cold.

439
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,400
Because I have to be right now.

440
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,920
I just watched Jay get killed right in front of my eyes,

441
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,730
just when I was starting to feel normal again,

442
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,080
just when I was beginning to love.

443
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,710
So if I let myself feel,

444
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,640
if I let all of that pain and anger out,

445
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,630
it's never gonna stop,

446
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,710
and that's not gonna help me either,

447
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,900
so let's just get back to this research

448
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,250
and figure out how to find King Shark.

449
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,100
Okay.

450
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,500
Here you are.

451
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,740
Yup, just like back home, always working.

452
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,590
I'm trying to locate this King Shark.

453
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,840
He's here? On this Earth?

454
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,910
Yes, it turns out our friend Zoom

455
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,800
brought him here to kill the Flash.

456
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,880
Looks like he's stuck here just like we are.

457
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,480
It looks like he is, and so I need to figure this out

458
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,430
before more people get hurt, Jessie, so...

459
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,010
Probability distribution algorithm?

460
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,530
Partial matching strategies, yes.

461
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,610
Based on what?

462
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,010
Semantic trajectories -- water, Central City, the Flash.

463
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,250
What about mobility behaviors?

464
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,560
Jessie.

465
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,480
Look, you wanted me out of that room,

466
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,830
but now that I am, you don't want me here.

467
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,170
Just let me help, please.

468
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,560
Grab a marker.

469
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:28,940
Yeah.

470
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,740
Hardest part was amping the torque without increasing drag.

471
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,310
A heavier engine would only slow things down,

472
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,130
but this streamlined version should optimize

473
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,000
both the torque and the horsepower.

474
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,770
Yeah, I'm just worried it's -- won't be enough still.

475
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
Here, let's do this--

476
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,670
use a one-to-one transfer gearbox

477
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,830
to drop the output shaft of the engine,

478
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,580
reverse rotation and send more power to the torque converter.

479
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,470
I didn't come here for you to just do it for me.

480
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,970
I thought we were gonna work on this together.

481
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,150
Yeah, we are, I'm--

482
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,090
I'm just trying to speed up the process.

483
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,130
Why?

484
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,360
What, you got somewhere better to be?

485
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,090
No, Wally, I'm-- Wally.

486
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,510
All right.

487
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,830
Do you have a problem with me?

488
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,670
Who could have a problem with you?

489
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,390
You're Barry, right? You're perfect.

490
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,440
Never do anything wrong.

491
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,060
Always this, always that.

492
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:30,970
Wally.

493
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,800
I mean, take a look around you, man.

494
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,750
You're in every picture in this room.

495
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,780
You know, thanks for your help,

496
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,710
but I'll just take care of this myself.

497
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,820
Where's the Flash?

498
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,230
I know the Flash is here.

499
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,100
I can smell him.

500
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,380
Everybody get out!

501
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,530
Come on. All right, come on.

502
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,070
Where is he?

503
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,890
Right here!

504
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,280
Flash, Zoom wants you dead!

505
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,520
Yeah, I know.

506
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,580
Then you get to go home, right?

507
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,560
Well, guess what, man.

508
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:40,560
The breaches that Zoom used to bring you here,

509
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,740
they're all gone. I closed 'em, for good!

510
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,380
There's no more Zoom.

511
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,100
There's no way back to your Earth.

512
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,640
You're gonna be locked up here for a very long time.

513
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,440
You might be fast, but not as fast as I am in water!

514
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,370
You're not gonna catch me, Flash!

515
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,370
Okay.

516
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,950
You okay?

517
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,380
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

518
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,040
Think he broke a few things, but I'm good.

519
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't suppose my homeowner's insurance

520
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,190
covers a "Sharknado" attack.

521
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,820
I don't understand you people.

522
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,320
Jaws busts through your house like the Kool-Aid Man,

524
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,310
the Flash shows up, and y'all just act like it's no big deal.

525
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,160
Yeah, well, we've had a lot of weird things happen

526
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,240
in Central City over the past two years.

527
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,970
Weirder than a talking shark wearing pants?

528
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,830
Man, you'd be surprised.

529
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,010
Hey, you guys. Everybody okay?

530
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,900
Yeah, yeah, we're fine.

531
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,660
What'd you go hide under your bed?

532
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,170
Wally, come on.

533
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,630
You know, Joe and Iris told me a lot about you,

534
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,010
made it out like you could walk water, or something,

535
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,930
but they never mentioned anything

536
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,410
about you being a coward.

537
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,250
Okay, enough!

538
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,530
See you guys later.

539
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,730
Dad, you need to talk to him.

540
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,400
No. It's fine, I get it.

541
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,770
Look, I know you guys love me,

542
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,630
but please stop telling Wally all this great stuff about me.

543
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,150
Start telling him the truth. I'm not perfect.

544
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,680
I make mistakes that even the Flash can't fix.

545
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,430
Okay.

546
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,270
What happened with you on Earth-2?

547
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,830
The truth.

548
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:13,490
I shouldn't... tell you guys this, but...

549
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,730
I met your doppelgangers.

550
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,990
You were the cop in the family, a good one too.

551
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,680
I told you I would've made a good cop.

552
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,280
Don't get any ideas.

553
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,560
What about me then?

554
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,060
You were a lounge singer.

555
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,720
Yeah, you had this amazing voice, actually,

556
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,590
but you didn't like me at all.

557
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,590
You actually blamed me for Iris becoming a cop,

558
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,750
said that she only became one

559
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,900
To help her selfish husband's career.

560
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,810
Wait.

561
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,490
We were married?

562
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,640
And we went to go see Joe perform.

563
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,200
And that's when everything went wrong.

564
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,930
Um, some metas that worked for zoom showed up,

565
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,930
they were looking for me.

566
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,170
They knew I wasn't supposed to be there,

567
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,490
and they attacked,

568
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,480
and you got caught in the crossfire,

569
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,440
and...You died.

570
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,600
I knew that it wasn't you,

571
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,830
that none of that was this life,

572
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,990
but...

573
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,610
I mean, watching it happen in front of me, living that,

574
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,320
it didn't feel any different, because it was all still real.

575
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,810
And Jay warned me not to get emotionally sucked in

576
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,240
when I went there,

577
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,980
and then that's exactly what happened.

578
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,000
And now Joe West on Earth-2 is dead, because I showed up.

579
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,750
Barry, that-- that's not your fault.

580
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,390
Yeah, it is my fault.

581
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,680
It's all my fault.

582
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:06,190
Zoom,

583
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,150
this King Shark,

584
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,070
Jay's death,

585
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,210
it's all because of me.

586
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,290
And then I just left an entire world

587
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,800
at Zoom's mercy.

588
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,020
Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the suburbs,

589
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,150
King Shark shows up at your house.

590
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,460
I mean, I don't even know how he found me.

591
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,630
It's not like I was the Flash while I was at home.

592
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,740
Must be a reason.

593
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:47,810
Yeah.

594
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,770
Have you figured out a way to track King Shark yet?

595
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,430
No, I don't have enough information

596
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,470
to create an accurate location algorithm.

597
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,740
What about Dr. Lamden's research?

598
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,790
Anything that can help us?

599
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,730
I didn't think so at first,

600
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,080
but then I found something that I think might help us.

601
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,150
Sharks are predators.

602
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,270
In order to track their prey,

603
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,650
they use what's known as passive electrolocation.

604
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,070
Passive electrolocation?

605
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,440
Yes, it's how they sense the bioelectric potential

606
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,860
around a fish's body.

607
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,300
King Shark senses electricity in Barry's system.

608
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,170
Okay, that explains how King Shark can track Barry,

609
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,940
but how is that going to help us track him?

610
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,580
We flip it.

611
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,020
Instead of King Shark being the predator,

612
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,080
we make him the prey,

613
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,440
and track him using active electrolocation.

614
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,680
We reprogram our satellite to generate

615
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,610
a specific electric field and then measure

616
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,420
any electrical distortions that correlate

617
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,360
with a 1-ton walking shark.

618
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,180
That'll help us get him.

619
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,180
You help me out?

620
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,910
Sure.

621
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:39,400
Great.

622
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,560
Let us know when you locate him

623
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,790
and we'll take it from there.

624
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,660
Okay.

625
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,380
Let's get the team ready.

626
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,700
What exactly is that?

627
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,260
That, my friend, is bait.

628
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,410
You made a Flash lure?

629
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,560
It's the best I could come up

630
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,120
with given the time frame.

631
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,600
It's rigged to mimic and enhance

632
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,360
the electric field Barry's body generates.

633
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,890
King Shark takes one whiff of that,

634
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,330
cue the "Jaws" soundtrack.

636
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,620
Also stuffed it with enough tranqs

637
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,810
to knock him out for a month.

638
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,870
Should make him a lot easier to reel in.

639
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,230
And that container.

640
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,310
Strong enough to hold him once he's sedated?

641
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,510
It's made of promethium metal. It's impenetrable.

642
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,800
Meanwhile, we'll be able to keep track of King Shark with this,

643
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,090
and the cameras that are on the lure.

644
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,110
Whatever he does, we'll have eyes on him.

645
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,520
All right, then. Let's go fishing.

646
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,000
Caitlin, I don't understand why

647
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,470
I can't be the one playing Quint in this scenario.

649
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,850
I should be the one out there, not you.

650
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,910
I need to do this.

651
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,540
You know Quint dies, right?

652
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,220
Water is this monster's natural habitat.

653
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,640
He's gonna be a lot stronger here.

654
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,770
You sure about this?

655
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,210
This ends tonight.

656
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,880
Maybe he's not gonna fall for this

657
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,000
He's a shark. He'll come.

658
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,770
Anything, Cisco?

659
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,390
Uh, nope, nothing that looks like it could be him.

660
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,740
You programmed the satellite though, right?

661
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,620
Yes, Harry.

662
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,680
I mean, you punched in the correct parameters?

663
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,360
You're insulting my intelligence.

664
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,670
But they've been waiting for hours.

665
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,980
I know they've been out there for hours,

666
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,870
but you're insulting my intelligence with this, okay?

667
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,170
- I know. - Okay.

668
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,700
Hey, you set the right distortion scope, right?

669
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,480
Oh, for real? Okay.

670
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,020
You know what, we're gonna play a game here.

671
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,390
It's called, if you're from Earth-2,

672
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,530
you're gonna be quiet, okay?

673
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,300
Yeah.

674
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,750
Hey, Barry, are you okay?

675
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,180
Ever since Zoom beat me here and on Earth-2,

676
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,080
I've been running away from things,

677
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,500
instead of towards them.

678
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,700
That needs to change.

679
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:00,760
We'll get you back there.

680
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,760
I know.

681
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,640
Think of this as your first step.

682
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,390
Or swim.

683
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,570
Uh, hey, guys. What is that?

684
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,250
The big Kahuna. Guys, incoming.

685
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,430
He's headed for the bait!

686
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:40,750
He ate the lure!

687
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,490
Reel him in, all right?

688
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,970
Come on.

689
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,240
Where'd he go?

690
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,450
He's headed for the docks.

691
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,140
Go, go, go.

692
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,550
Get ready to fire!

693
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,550
Those guns won't stop me, Flash.

694
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:26,060
First I'll kill you, then I'll kill them.

695
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,860
Oh, yeah? Let's do this then!

696
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,810
Come on!

697
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,040
What is he doing?

698
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,860
He's electrifying the water.

699
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,470
Now we can reel him in.

700
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,570
Hell of a catch, Barry.

701
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,530
Yeah.

702
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,580
Let's just make sure he doesn't become

703
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,110
"The one that got away."

704
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,680
Won't let that happen again.

705
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,870
What are you gonna do with him?

706
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:15,740
I don't know yet. But one thing's for sure,

707
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,460
A.R.G.U.S.'s plans to turn King Shark into a weapon

708
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,080
died with Amanda Waller.

709
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,150
I think our time would be better served

710
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,660
learning about how he came to be

711
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,260
and how to cure him.

712
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,860
You know, you should really talk to Dr. Lamden.

713
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,920
She's done a lot of research,

714
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,140
and I think it could be helpful to you.

715
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,130
I'll do that.

716
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,610
Nice to see you again.

717
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,160
Well, thanks a lot, Dig.

718
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,050
Hey, I got to thank you, Barry.

719
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,380
Got Lyla get her first win,

720
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,080
I got to watch you run on water.

721
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,990
It was biblical.

722
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,180
Look, Barry, when I was in Afghanistan,

723
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,250
I lost a lot of friends-- brothers.

724
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,990
So losing Jay, I know what it feels like.

725
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,700
Question yourself. Blame yourself for his death.

726
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,740
And that guilt, it can tear you apart,

727
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,440
but trust me, man,

728
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,840
You got to get control of it,

729
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,040
Or it'll rip you up inside.

730
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,770
Use this, man, let it guide you,

731
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,020
so it never happens again.

732
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,510
- All right, thanks, man. - You got it.

733
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,010
Say hi to everyone for me, all right?

734
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:26,880
I will.

735
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,200
Yeah, okay. That's kind of freaky.

736
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,870
Yeah, yeah, see? I told you.

737
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,140
Hey, Oliver, what's up?

739
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,840
You're a really slow reader.

740
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,740
So?

741
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,640
I want one of these super cars.

743
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,170
I mean, especially

744
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,410
if I can run it off the bacon grease I collect? I mean--

745
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,750
Man, Wally.

746
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,830
I'm so impressed.

747
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,670
Thanks.

748
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,380
But Barry gave me a lot of help, so...

749
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,130
Yeah, he did, but this was all your idea,

750
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,880
This is your hard work. It's all you.

751
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,330
Barry'd say the same thing.

752
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,340
Would he?

753
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,000
Look, Wally.

754
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,640
Iris and I took Barry in when he was 11,

755
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,580
and the reason he came to live with us

756
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,450
is because his mother was murdered,

757
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,790
and his father was wrongfully imprisoned for it.

758
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,250
And I have been overprotective of that kid since that day.

759
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:48,120
We gave him all the love and support he needed

760
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,500
to get through that tragedy

761
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,000
and become the man he is now.

762
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,290
So that--that pride

763
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,660
you see when iris and I are talking about him,

764
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,260
is because...

765
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,830
things could have gone very differently.

766
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,080
But he's not perfect,

767
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,380
and he's not favored over you or Iris or anybody else.

768
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,600
So you have nothing to worry about.

769
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,600
He's my son...

770
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,630
just like you are.

771
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,480
What are you doing with those?

772
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,480
I'm adjusting the wavelength trigger,

773
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,530
See if I can get these to work over here.

774
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,710
So you can catch some breachers?

775
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,170
dear god!

776
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,360
Caitlin, your hands are freezing.

777
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,070
Caitlin. I've always hated that name.

778
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,990
Oh, no.

779
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,330
No, no, no, it's starting. You're starting to become--

780
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:48,030
Killer Frost?

781
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,670
That ain't right.

782
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,360
That ain't right, that's just rude.

783
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,240
Who put you up to this?

784
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,470
Barry put you up to this, didn't he?

785
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:00,410
Oh, I should've know you two were--

786
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,870
- Cold? - Yeah.

787
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,160
You deserve it

788
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,960
for thinking that I could ever become like her.

789
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,210
Cisco, you need to stop worrying about me.

790
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,280
I may be sad, I may want to be alone for a little while,

791
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,760
but I promise you,

792
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,420
Killer Frost will never exist on this earth, okay?

793
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,650
Besides, you tested me.

794
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,020
I don't even have the meta-human gene,

795
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,440
So please stop worrying about me, okay?

796
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,630
Okay.

797
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,520
Come on, Barry wants us upstairs.

798
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,280
For real, though, you got to work on that circulation.

799
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:35,370
You might have Raynaud's or something.

800
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,270
You know what Raynaud's is?

801
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,690
I'm a doctor, Cisco.

802
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,180
Hail, hail, the gang's all here.

803
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,670
What's good?

804
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,530
I need to apologize to you all.

805
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,270
Last year I made a choice

806
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:00,080
to go back in time and save my mother,

807
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,680
and that choice had a lot of consequences

808
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,890
that will haunt me for the rest of my life,

809
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,000
just like I know it haunts all of you too.

810
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,030
Zoom,

811
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,140
Jay's death...

812
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,880
it's all because of me,

813
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:27,140
but I own those choices.

814
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,600
We're the ones who opened the door to Earth-2.

815
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,690
We're the ones who brought Zoom here,

816
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,620
but we are also the ones who are gonna stop him.

817
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,450
How?

818
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,240
How are we gonna stop Zoom, Allen?

819
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,970
I don't know yet.

820
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,640
But those breaches aren't closed forever,

821
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,720
and we're not done with Earth-2.

822
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,150
Jay's death was not in vain.

823
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,310
We will meet Zoom again,

824
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,010
and the next time, I will beat him,

825
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,610
whoever that monster is.

826
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,810
Well, this is a complication.
