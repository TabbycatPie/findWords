1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,300
No begging. No begging.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,540
Stella, you're breaking my heart here.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,310
What's breaking your heart is that sausage and bacon.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,570
Can't you just pick one?

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,970
Don't worry. I'm gonna burn it off

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,180
on the golf course.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,020
How, Jay?

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,460
By riding the little cart

9
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,480
or by kicking the ball back into play?

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,660
Here. I'm gonna take Joe Fulgencio to the park.

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,550
Can you please stop by the grocery store?

12
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,960
Why doesn't the nanny do this?

13
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,470
You got to be kidding me!

14
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,900
Gloria has fired five nannies.

15
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,250
I don't like another woman in my house.

16
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,350
I want to be the star.

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,780
Stars have nannies.

18
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,050
You know that some of this is Manny's fault.

19
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,460
Manny!

20
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,040
So, Marie, what do you feel like doing for dinner tonight?

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,400
You're eating Dyno-Bites

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,600
because you are a little boy.

23
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,670
Mom!

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,660
I'm telling you, there's an embarrassing

25
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,800
press conference in that kid's future.

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,800
We're getting married in seven months.

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,970
Or eight months.

28
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,790
I worry about it raining in april.

29
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,310
Well, I worry about me sweating in may.

30
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,340
Oh, well, we can't decide on anything.

31
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,850
There -- there are too many choices.

32
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,040
Fortunately, one of our best friends

33
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,260
is an event planner.

34
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,330
- Pepper! - Pepper!

35
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,590
Here come the grooms

36
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,120
All dressed in fun tuxes from my Pepper collection

37
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,780
Ha, wow -- look at all your ideas.

38
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,340
Honey, this is just the index.

39
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,790
Ronaldo!

40
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,140
I brought linens and place settings

41
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,100
and invitations and stemware.

42
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,620
Hello. I'm Ronaldo.

43
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,610
Oh, don't be such a chatterbox.

44
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:25,270
And go and fetch the platter box.

45
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,280
Now, let's lose this couch.

46
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,930
Wow, you need that much space, huh?

47
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,130
No, it's hideous.

48
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,710

YYeTs.com

54
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,460
You're ruining my life!

55
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,580
These eggs are delicious.

56
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,570
What life?! Get out of my room!

57
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,610
I put milk in them.

58
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,860
It's not your room anymore!

59
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,290
Well, they sure are fluffy.

60
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,400
Mom!

61
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,010
- Hey, dad. - Morning, troops.

62
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,000
Claire, I owe you a pack of lady razors.

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,560
I'm just gonna go stand out in the yard.

64
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,580
Seriously, get out!

65
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,410
I told you it's not your room!

66
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,240
Tension between Haley and Alex

67
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,540
has been getting pretty high,

68
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,190
so our solution was to move Haley down to the basement,

69
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,580
which we were just about to do --

70
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,530
When my dad came out for a weekend visit.

71
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,700
Two weekends ago.

72
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,000
After my mom passed away,

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
he dated this woman named Annie,

74
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,630
and she broke up with him,

75
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,160
and then he seemed kind of down,

76
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,270
so I invited him out.

77
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,570
Gross! Those are my socks!

78
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,010
They are not! Mom!

79
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,670
I'm just gonna pop outside.

80
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,200
I should get her a rake.

81
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,910
Welcome to King's landing!

82
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,540
I am the evil boy king,

83
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,190
and I want your heads!

84
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,290
Oh, look how much they all love you.

85
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,640
Ohh, thanks.

86
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,830
I'm just trying to match the energy

87
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,450
of their video games and whosits and whatnots.

88
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,610
So, I'm gonna play tennis.

89
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,680
I can pick you up at noon.

90
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,870
- Oh, hi! Joan, right? - Yes.

91
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,410
Hi. I'm Andy.

92
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,210
I'm her manny -- male nanny.

93
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,490
Hi, I'm Gloria.

94
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,330
This might just sound a little crazy,

95
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,670
but I don't think Joan likes me.

96
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,620
Oh, that's not crazy. She doesn't.

97
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,040
Her husband's always staring at you,

98
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,510
and she's worried you're gonna steal him.

99
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,510
- What?! - Be happy, little guy.

100
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,250
This world belongs to you.

101
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,500
I would never steal anybody else's man,

102
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,290
especially not her fat husband.

103
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,850
Hey, he's not fat anymore.

104
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,890
I helped him lose 30 pounds.

105
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,130
Thank you, Andy.

106
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,870
Careful.

107
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,030
If I bring you home scratched,

108
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,410
I lose my deposit.

109
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,270
I'm kind of a chef, too.

110
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,820
Here, try this.

111
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,460
It's quinoa.

112
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,820
You actually burn calories while eating I--

113
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,140
So, Andy, tell me,

114
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
are you really happy with that Joan?

115
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,440
Every wedding is unique, like a snowflake.

116
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,650
And my job is to give you

117
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,420
the snowflake that makes everyone die with jealousy.

118
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,220
That's all we ever wanted.

119
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,000
So, let's start with a color palette.

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm thinking...

121
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,170
Purple.

122
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,670
- Purple! That is a color! - Wow!

123
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,540
We don't love -- yeah, we don't love purple.

124
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,020
Not our favorite, but...

125
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,780
- Excuse me? - Well, it's just that purple

126
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,080
might be a little bit bold for --

127
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,980
No, I get it. You think I'm an idiot.

128
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,130
- No. No! - No, we don't, Pepper.

129
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,950
Well, obviously, you know better than I.

130
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,060
After all, I've only put on

131
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,980
hundreds of magnificent weddings.

132
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,180
Come, Ronaldo.

133
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,410
They're not interested in planning a wedding.

134
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,200
They're interested in hurting people.

135
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,130
No, Pepper. Pepper, wait.

136
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,770
No, Pepper, wait. Listen. No, no.

137
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,500
We can consider purple.

138
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,060
This is just a lot for us to take in.

139
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,290
Of course. I get it. I...

140
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,490
Let the idea wash over you for a bit.

141
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,300
We had also discussed a more neutral palette.

142
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,540
Ronaldo! They're washing!

143
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,820
I'm sorry. He means well.

144
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,740
Now, let's talk about your entrance.

145
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,150
Yes. Entrance.

146
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,040
The idea of two men being able to marry

147
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,360
seemed like a fantasy,

148
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,000
so I see you riding down the purple aisle

149
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,410
on a...

150
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,750
...unicorn.

151
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,540
Are you sure, grandpa? It might be fun.

152
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,360
Sorry, Luke. I just don't think I have it in me today.

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,890
Did you see that?

154
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,760
When has your dad ever

155
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,700
not wanted to pull Luke's finger?

156
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,330
He's hurting, Phil.

157
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,490
I think he needs to see a therapist.

158
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,930
Claire, he doesn't need a therapist.

159
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,370
Why? Honey, that's what they do.

160
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,120
They help people cope with loss.

161
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,160
They'll even come to the house if we need them to.

162
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,720
I should talk to my dad. You know what?

163
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,990
He was pretty down after the divorce.

164
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,590
- I bet he has some insight. - Yeah, 'cause your dad's

165
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,220
so in touch with people's feelings?

166
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,610
When a man is overcome with emotion

167
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,940
at a Celine Dion concert,

168
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,740
- you do not tell him to grow a pair! - Phil!

169
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,840
The ship went down, but their love lasts forever!

170
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,170
Dad? Hi.

171
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,720
Yeah, listen. Uh, Frank is really depressed.

172
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,080
I think he should see a therapist.

173
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
- What do you say? - He doesn't need any of that!

174
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,730
Yeah? Uh-huh. T-that's exactly what I said.

175
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,950
- Give me that. - I-I...

176
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,980
Jay, what did you just say?

177
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,640
Take him out and meet some women.

178
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,440
1,000 therapists couldn't do what Gloria did for me.

179
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,510
Oh, I agree. Claire was wrong.

180
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,490
I'll tell you what. I know a fun place.

181
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,140
Tonight, you, me, and Frank out on the town.

182
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,710
Oh, fun! A three-way!

183
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,290
I already regret this.

184
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,820
Well, I'm excited, too. I got to get going, though.

185
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,830
All right. Bye.

186
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,800
Gloria, we're back!

187
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,820
Here! Let me lighten your load.

188
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,560
- Who are you? - I'm the new manny.

189
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,850
Am I being replaced?

190
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:29,670
Jay, Manny, meet Joe's new manny, Andy.

191
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,450
- Can I talk to you a second? -No, thank you.

192
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,030
We're gonna need to discuss this.

193
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,390
I get it. I understand it's a big decision.

194
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,350
But if it eases your mind at all,

195
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,570
know that I'm not just here for baby Joe.

196
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,810
I'm here for you, too.

197
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,930
Doesn't ease my mind at all.

198
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,490
My mission is to make all of your lives

199
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,910
happier and healthier.

200
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,160
Is this because I ate that party sub?

201
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,960
Ohh! Crackers!

202
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,120
I left my phone upstairs in the nursery.

203
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,970
Could you grab it for me?

204
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,370
I know people get all squirrelly

205
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,640
when they hear the word "Healthy."

206
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,860
Actually, Manny? My phone is in my pocket.

207
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,030
Sorry, bud.

208
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,880
But my goal is to get you healthy without --

209
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,610
Nope!

210
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,310
It is just a pack of gum.

211
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,120
My phone is still upstairs.

212
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,220
-- without you even realizing what's happening.

213
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,540
Wow. I'm such a dodo.

214
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,080
I didn't even bring my phone today.

215
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,050
I know what you're doing.

216
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,390
We are gonna talk about it.

217
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,630
Okay, well, you have my number, so I can start tomorrow.

218
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,020
- Call me. - I will!

219
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,030
Take care!

220
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,360
That's a nonstarter. Keep looking.

221
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,540
But he's perfect.

222
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,080
He's a man. It's weird.

223
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,570
He's a weird man.

224
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,830
He's like Phil, only I have to pay for him.

225
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,220
This is not a dictatorship! It's a democracy!

226
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:38,950
We vote!

227
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,640
No way. You always bully Manny, and he caves.

228
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,330
He's weak.

229
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:41,930
No offense.

230
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,670
Whoever thinks that we should hire Andy,

231
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,120
raise the hand!

232
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,600
No, sorry, mom. Not this time.

233
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,590
I can't have that energy in my house.

234
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,870
Fine. Cook your own dinner!

235
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,520
We will. We'll be fine.

236
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,720
So, what are we having?

237
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,650
You're on your own, kid. I'm going out tonight.

238
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,120
So, what do you think?

239
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,950
I like it.

240
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,060
Also, is it a little Willy Wonka?

241
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,560
You're tired. I'll come back tomorrow

242
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,650
when you're ready to be more constructive.

243
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,580
- Pepper, no. - Pepper.

244
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,020
Ronaldo, strike this.

245
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,570
Sorry. I thought I was wearing a cape today.

246
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,630
Oh. Oh, my gosh.

247
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,150
Ohh. What are we gonna do?

248
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,100
I-I think we have to fire Pepper.

249
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,410
That would kill him.

250
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,100
- He's on the brink as it is. - Why?

251
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,630
Since the proposition ocho was overturned,

252
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,780
he's done 50 gay weddings.

253
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,340
The man is exhausted, searching for new ideas.

254
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,200
You said "Ocho"

255
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,580
and then you said "50."

256
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,860
You see? Gays are so nit-picky.

257
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,000
In a straight wedding,

258
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,700
you just have to please the bride,

259
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,000
But the gays have such strong opinions!

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,720
It takes a toll on a great artist

261
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,950
like Pepper Saltzman.

262
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,440
You know, I've never thought of it that way.

263
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,190
I mean, look at us. We can't agree on one thing.

264
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,260
No, you're right.

265
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,900
I mean, Cam wants a rustic country theme,

266
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,820
and I'm looking for something

267
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,810
a little more contemporary and sophisticated.

268
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,550
And it's impossible.

269
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,950
But you can have both.

270
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,250
Casual elegance, classic with a twist.

271
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,220
Go on.

272
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,710
I'd start with raw, natural-linen table runners

273
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,510
to bring the two worlds together.

274
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,020
We eschew the classic round tables

275
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,010
for rectangular farm tables,

276
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,620
but keep the setting clean and modern.

277
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,010
And then...

278
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes!

279
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,720
No, I mustn't. This is wrong.

280
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,010
Pepper is my boss and my mentor!

281
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,200
Oh, and he's our friend. What are we doing?

282
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,380
We -- we got caught up. We gave in to temptation.

283
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,520
I-I should go.

284
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,030
- Don't! - I must.

285
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,680
Vintage handkerchiefs for the guests to cry into.

286
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,930
Ronaldo, wait!

287
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,630
French bistro stemless wine glasses.

288
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,160
I've said too much.

289
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,500
Ronaldo!

290
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,790
He's gone, Cam.

291
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,130
Guys, we can't stand around all night.

292
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,850
At some point, we have to talk to somebody.

293
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,980
Now, come on. How about those two?

294
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,860
Let's go over there.

295
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,780
Oh, my god. I don't know why I'm so nervous.

296
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,410
- Hello, ladies. - Not interested.

297
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,510
Wow. I-I just said hello.

298
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,430
We're just kind of having a girls' night.

299
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,500
Kathy, be nice. I'm marcy.

300
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,660
I'm Jay. This is Frank and, uh, Phil.

301
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,580
Hey-lo. I mean hey. Or hello.

302
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,790
I don't know.

303
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,220
And for the record, i just wanted to introduce my friend.

304
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,140
I wasn't trying to pick you up or anything.

305
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,540
I'm heartbroken.

306
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,010
We don't mean to disturb you.

307
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,520
Oh, you're not disturbing us.

308
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,820
You have sweet eyes.

309
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,900
Thank you. I'm from Florida.

310
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,520
I love Florida!

311
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,010
Would you like to sit down, Frank?

312
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,100
Well, I, uh -- yeah, sure.

313
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,110
Oh, my god. It's happening.

314
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,990
For your information, I'm married to a gorgeous woman.

315
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,490
Dad, Jay and I

316
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,090
- are gonna grab a drink from the bar. - Sure.

317
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,190
I think I have a picture of her here on this somewhere.

318
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,150
Yeah, she won beauty pageants.

319
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,740
Okay. I'm a catch.

320
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,480
Let's get out of here. This place is dead, anyway.

321
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,280
Hey, there's Casanova!

322
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,510
I didn't hear you come in last night.

323
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,390
So -- so, uh, how did it go with Marcy?

324
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,650
Oh, it was okay.

325
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,920
But I actually met someone else

326
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,280
while I was waiting for a taxi.

327
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,690
Well, all right.

328
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,140
And she's downstairs right now.

329
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,760
Well, all right.

330
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,300
Truth is, I, um, have a bit of a situation.

331
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,960
She says I owe her $500.

332
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,690
Please tell me you broke something of hers.

333
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,640
No, turns out she's a hooker.

334
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,630
You picked up a hooker?

335
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,200
Well, I didn't know she was a hooker.

336
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,080
We're in my kitchen. We have to stop saying "Hooker"!

337
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,720
You got to get her out of here

338
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,190
before Claire gets back from yoga.

339
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,280
She's not gonna leave until she gets the cash.

340
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,630
$500? I think you got ripped off.

341
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,140
- Hey, can I have a hit of that coffee? - Oh, that's fine.

342
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,820
Trust me. He did not get ripped off.

343
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,340
No, that's good. It's yours.

344
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,690
$247. I'm gonna have to run to an atm.

345
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,470
How could you not know?!

346
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,250
Well, the drinks, the flirting.

347
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,980
I couldn't think straight.

348
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,240
Have you ever touched the smooth,

349
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,910
taut skin of a 48-year-old woman?

350
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,380
I hope to one day,

351
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,420
but that's not gonna happen if Claire gets home and --

352
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,410
Hi! I'm back!

353
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,450
Frank, did you have fun last night?

354
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,040
No. He did not.

355
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,670
Hey. Who's the woman in the kitchen?

356
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,110
Beats me. I think I'll go freshen up.

357
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,380
There's a woman in the kitchen?

358
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,970
There's a woman in the kitchen. Yeah, she's a therapist.

359
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,580
The therapist that you recommended.

360
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,120
So I decided it was a good idea.

361
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,570
Oh, that means the world that you listened to me.

362
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,320
- Thank you! - Ohh, you should get a shower upstairs.

363
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,820
Oh, no, I want to say hi.

364
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,840
No, not sweaty like that.

365
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,800
You smell.

366
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,950
No, uh...

367
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,960
Hi! Hi, I'm Claire.

368
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,480
I'm Frank's daughter-in-law,

369
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,030
and I just want to thank you so much

370
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,080
for coming and helping him out this way.

371
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,730
- It was my idea. - No, it wasn't.

372
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:45,880
- Okay. - All right.

373
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,260
No, hey. I've never told anyone this,

374
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,890
but I have always wanted to do what you do.

375
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,580
I think I'd be really good at it.

376
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,180
- No, she wouldn't. - What are you talking about?

377
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,170
It's basically what I already do for the whole neighborhood.

378
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,760
At least this way, I get paid for it.

379
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,410
You know, I got a standing 10:30 I got to get to.

380
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,290
- Yes. Yes, you do! - Mom, I'm gonna throw up!

381
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,080
It is not cheese!

382
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,630
It is cruelty-free organic shampoo

383
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,870
with traces of churned goat's milk!

384
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,010
So cheese!

385
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,300
Ew, I need a bucket!

386
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,820
Ladies, we have a guest.

387
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,500
I am -- I'm really sorry about this.

388
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,430
I'm just at my wit's end with these two.

389
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,690
I don't suppose you have any experience with teenagers?

390
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,600
Oh, no.

391
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,050
You two remind me of me and my sister.

392
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,670
We used to fight all the time.

393
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,690
I used to accuse her of stealing my boyfriend.

394
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,830
She would accuse me of trying to stab her.

395
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,990
- You know, sister stuff. - Oh, my god.

396
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,550
Trust me, if I wanted to stab her,

397
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,380
that skank be stabbed.

398
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,800
She's not a therapist, is she?

399
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:39,950
Just...

400
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,540
I didn't sleep a wink.

401
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,570
I-I cannot stop thinking about Ronaldo.

402
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,290
I know.

403
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,180
I dreamt our wedding made

404
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,020
the cover of Modern Gay Grooms

405
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,610
and that there was a magazine called Modern Gay Grooms.

406
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,590
Okay, that's -- that's Pepper.

407
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,680
Let's just ask him to let Ronaldo take the lead.

408
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,170
And -- and risk hurting Pepper?

409
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,270
For all we know,

410
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,510
Ronaldo hasn't even given us a second thought.

411
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,900
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

412
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,940
What happened here yesterday was real.

413
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,930
Oh, Ronaldo! We felt it, too.

414
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,070
But what about Pepper?

415
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,490
- I left him. - What?

416
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,230
It's over. He doesn't look at me the way you do.

417
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,140
Ohh, this is all happening so fast.

418
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,540
For me, too.

419
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,000
But my heart was racing when I left here.

420
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,940
You are my muses-es.

421
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,190
Ohh. I feel so guilty.

422
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,400
One quick look. No one has to know.

423
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,310
Oh, Ronaldo, what have you done?

424
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,970
Mitchell! Cameron!

425
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,920
- Oh, no! - Uh, uh, quick! Hide!

426
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'll hide.

427
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,810
- Cam, not you. - Okay, yeah. Go, go, go, go, go.

428
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,410
Ronaldo left me.

429
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,080
- What?! No! - The swine!

430
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,610
Someone put it in his head that he could do this without me.

431
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,850
But mark my words, I will destroy him

432
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,030
and whatever wedding he thinks he's planning.

433
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,620
Okay, well, that's one way to go.

434
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,370
Daddies, there's a man in the bathroom.

435
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,230
- What? - That -- that's a Wiggles song.

436
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,920
That's a Wiggles song.

437
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,910
Daddy, there's a man in the bathroom

438
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,910
There's a man in the bathroom

439
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,350
It's okay, honey. It's okay.

440
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,110
He's in the shower

441
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,900
Ronaldo was nothing before I found him,

442
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,090
living in squalor in a dump barely bigger than this.

443
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,820
How could he do this to me?

444
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,470
Because you never listen to anybody!

445
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,710
I have good ideas, but you're too thick-headed to hear them!

446
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,910
Ronaldo, how did you get here?

447
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:20,370
It was you two. You plotted against me.

448
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,690
I bet that's not even a Wiggles song, is it?

449
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,530
- Is it?! - No.

450
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,640
Pepper, we can explain.

451
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,760
Do you have any idea how hard I work?

452
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,060
Well, maybe that's part of the problem.

453
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,570
I mean, you've been through the mill, Pepper.

454
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,460
Heard it.

455
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,090
I've done 53 gay weddings.

456
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,800
And... none of them are mine.

457
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,990
Ohh. Pepper.

458
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,600
And whose fault is that?

459
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,040
I feel like you're implying mine,

460
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,490
but I really don't see it.

461
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,940
How can a man with such flare for setting tables

462
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,160
leave no seat for one who loves him?!

463
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,570
- Oh, my god. - Ronaldo's in love with Pepper.

464
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,230
I know. That's why I said, "Oh, my god."

465
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,550
Pepper, do you hear what Ronaldo is saying?

466
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,500
Of course I do. I'm not a fool.

467
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,310
He thinks I can't set a table.

468
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,450
No. No, no, no.

469
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,080
Ronaldo is in love with you. Go to him.

470
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,850
What?

471
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,500
You're in love with me?

472
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,010
Si. It is true. Yes.

473
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,650
God, that would drive me crazy.

474
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,950
Ronaldo, I-I don't know what to say.

475
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,930
I mean, of course, when I hired you,

476
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,760
I found you very attractive.

477
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,050
That's why I hire all my people.

478
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,370
But I...

479
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,370
I never thought you...

480
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,640
would find me...

481
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,500
Perfecto?

482
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
Because that's what you are -- perfect.

483
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,840
No. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I can't.

484
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,340
Gloria, I forgot my towel!

485
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,120
Here it is. Nice and toasty from the dryer.

486
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,690
Gloria!

487
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,870
She ran to the store. Breakfast in 5.

488
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:05,990
Your underpants are pressed and on your bed.

489
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,670
Gloria!

490
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,180
So, if I'm hearing you right, you're not so much mad

491
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,530
about the prostitute in the kitchen

492
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,250
as you are about my lying to you.

493
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,770
No, I'm mad about the prostitute in the kitchen.

494
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,870
Hmm. That's my bad.

495
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,080
Yes, it is. It's your bad, Frank. Very bad.

496
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,750
Look, I'm a progressive woman.

497
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,440
I-I took a pole-dancing class.

498
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,480
I sent my daughter to college with condoms.

499
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,620
Wait, now, I think that sends the wrong message.

500
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,580
- Thank you very much. - No! You don't get to judge!

501
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,720
I...Frank, I'm --

502
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,550
I know you're upset about Annie breaking up with you.

503
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,550
Wait, Annie didn't break up with me.

504
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,660
I broke up with her.

505
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,940
- W-what? - Why? I thought she was so great!

506
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,520
Well, I got scared. I didn't know how to...

507
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,620
be with another woman.

508
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,900
I thought your mother and I would be together forever.

509
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,640
Ah... I'm sorry, dad.

510
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,090
I never would have gone through with it last night,

511
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,890
but, uh, Jeannie was so nice and professional.

512
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,500
Well, thank you, Frank.

513
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,320
And for what it's worth,

514
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,200
you got nothing to be nervous about.

515
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,360
You were wonderful.

516
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,340
Really? You think so?

517
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,370
Yeah.

518
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,080
If you love that woman, you should go get her back.

519
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,670
She'll be lucky to have you.

520
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,070
Seriously, I see a lot of guys your age.

521
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,140
Most of them can barely --

522
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,200
Okay. Let's get you in that cab.

523
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,750
I love your kids.

524
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,470
That Alex is like a little me.

525
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,660
- Yeah! - Oh, My God.

526
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,980
Good morning, boss, junior boss.

527
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,620
Grab a seat and check it out.

528
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,330
Egg-white omelet, high-protein smoothies,

529
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,830
then I thought we could put on our running shoes and go...

530
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,990
I need to cut you off right there, chief.

531
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,290
Seems my wife overstepped her bounds.

532
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,830
- Now, you seem like a nice guy. - Thanks.

533
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,230
But I don't think you're the best fit for this house.

534
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,760
- Are -- are you serious? - I'm afraid so.

535
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,670
Okay.

536
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,710
It was the underpants, wasn't it?

537
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,690
That didn't help.

538
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,490
Man, I came on too strong. Gosh dang it!

539
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,540
My dad warned me about that when I turned 14.

540
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,580
He said, "Son, you're about to be the man of the family.

541
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,710
You got to learn to give people time

542
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,920
to see how special you are."

543
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,500
Why were you the man of the family?

544
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,030
- He sort of died. - How?

545
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,180
I don't want to bring you down, little man.

546
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,100
Neither did my dad.

547
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,370
He'd say, "My disease can't be all bad

548
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,780
if it rhymes with 'answer.'"

549
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,090
Those are the flaxseed muffins that I just baked.

550
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,900
I'll just take them out and get out of here.

551
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,100
Andy, wait.

552
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,030
We're never gonna eat them.

553
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,490
Well, then... I'm sorry it didn't work out.

554
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,690
What didn't work out?

555
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,120
My mission here.

556
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,850
It was really nice to meet you, though, Mrs. P.

557
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,460
You didn't even give him a chance.

558
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,320
We took a vote, mom.

559
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,570
You got to respect the vote.

560
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,240
No! You make me hire these nannies that I don't like.

561
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,870
But when I find one that I like, you fire him?!

562
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,800
I am the one that spends most of the time around here!

563
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,810
SO I GET TO PICK!

564
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,980
Sometimes the louder we are, the less we're heard.

565
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,400
- You're frustrated right now, aren't you? - Yes.

566
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,700
Because you feel like they're not hearing you.

567
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,440
Yes.

568
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,540
Well, that's exactly how they feel.

569
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,440
I'm sorry that I ignored your feelings.

570
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,180
I promise that I will try not to yell so much.

571
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,340
- You're hired. - What?!

572
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,990
You better drink that smoothie. We're going on a run!

573
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,500
This isn't over.

574
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,430
Life isn't easy.

575
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,170
Sometimes we just need a little help,

576
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,370
getting your confidence back,

577
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,530
getting on the same page,

578
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,760
getting out of your own way,

579
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,740
or just getting moving.

580
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,610
And I'm pleased as punch to be the one --

581
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,100
Okay, this is tough enough without all the yammering!

582
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,960
Sorry.

583
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,570
What would you like to dance to?

584
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,580
I have to tell you we have to have some sort of square dancing.

585
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,030
We're not doing country.

586
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,360
No square dancing. We're not.

587
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,790
There will be no hoedown tonight. Pepper and I are on...

588
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,730
My family is going to throw a fit.

589
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,120
- They'll riot. - We're not getting married for them.

590
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,510
We're getting married for us.

591
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,340
And I think we have a decorative cake out front,

592
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,910
and then we have sheet cakes in the back.

593
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,470
Oh, I see! Is that the theme you're going for

594
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,150
-- tacky?!

595
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,930
Sheet -- like a sheet.

596
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,740
Oh, "Sheet."

597
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,560
I thought he said "Chic cake."

598
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,600
All of my cakes are chic.
