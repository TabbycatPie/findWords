1
00:00:01,064 --> 00:00:02,329
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:05,066
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,668 --> 00:00:08,735
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:11,805
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:15,375
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:17,277
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,647
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:24,017
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:26,953
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:28,488
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,191
When my mother left us, she was pregnant.

12
00:00:31,193 --> 00:00:34,527
Dad, I'm so sorry that
I didn't tell you sooner.

13
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:37,263
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

14
00:00:37,265 --> 00:00:39,299
You want Barry to get faster?

15
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:43,903
The more power he has, the more I can take.

16
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:46,873
- Don't let him take me back there.
- I won't.

17
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,508
You're going to help me

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,845
in return for your daughter's life.

19
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:54,748
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.

20
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:59,085
I know I'm moving pretty fast,

21
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:01,021
but stop me if you've
heard this one before.

22
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:03,289
Boy meets girl. Happens every day.

23
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,858
Except this boy was struck by lightning

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,960
and became the fastest man alive.

25
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:10,664
So nothing is ever that simple.

26
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,865
- Ho!
- Oh, my...

27
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh... ah... Careful!

28
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,502
- Oh, boy.
- Sorry!

29
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:16,803
It's all good.

30
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:18,738
It's all good.

31
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,907
Those weren't for me anyway, right?

32
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,843
They were. I didn't realize
roses were so flammable.

33
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:25,545
Oh, my gosh.

34
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:27,580
Well, it's the... it's
the thought that counts.

35
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:30,283
And, you know, and proper
fire safety management,

36
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:31,951
- that... that counts most.
- Yes.

37
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:35,555
I have spent most of my life

38
00:01:35,557 --> 00:01:37,357
feeling very unlucky.

39
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,325
Yeah, and now?

40
00:01:39,327 --> 00:01:41,594
Feels like I've been
struck by lightning twice.

41
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:55,108
Help!

42
00:01:56,144 --> 00:01:58,378
Help me...

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,584
Flash, everything you have will be mine.

44
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:06,252
- No!
- No!

45
00:02:06,254 --> 00:02:08,822
- No!
- Aah!

47
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:23,102
Okay, so there's my desk.

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,671
Upstairs is anti-crime and the CSI lab...

49
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:26,906
that's where Barry works.

50
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:29,642
And we have the open files...

51
00:02:29,644 --> 00:02:31,110
And that is a pencil.

52
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:33,079
That: stapler.

53
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:35,114
Okay. Sorry, Wally.

54
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:37,016
Obviously, your sister got the funny genes.

55
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:39,618
Captain. I want you to meet somebody.

56
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,187
This is my son Wally West.

57
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,722
Handsome young man, Joe.

58
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:44,423
Hey, he's a West. He can't help that.

59
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,325
Your pops here is a hell of a detective.

60
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:49,161
Obviously not.

61
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,198
Well, pleasure to meet you, Wally.

62
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:57,036
Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Wally.

63
00:02:57,038 --> 00:02:59,872
Yeah, I've always wanted a baby brother.

64
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:01,674
What about the White Shadow?

65
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:05,044
You're joking, but yeah,
we did call Barry that.

66
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,812
Well, he's been pretty busy.

67
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:08,581
He's doing a whole lot of running around.

68
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:11,484
But why don't we do
dinner? The whole family.

69
00:03:11,486 --> 00:03:13,319
I, uh, I got plans.

70
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:14,653
Oh, Iris'll cook.

71
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:15,955
Dad, we just met the kid.

72
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:17,156
We don't want to kill him.

73
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:18,624
All right, we do takeout. Chinese.

74
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:19,892
Whatever. Come on.

75
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:21,994
Where are your cuffs, taillights?

76
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:24,530
Come on, let's go.

77
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:25,965
You know that kid?

78
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:27,800
Uh, no... no.

79
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:29,835
You know, it's just what they say.

80
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:32,972
I got one of those faces.

81
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:35,207
I'll see you guys at dinner.

82
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:36,509
Uh, okay.

83
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,414
Any chance I could chat
with you for a minute?

84
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,982
Yeah, what's up, Detective?

85
00:03:42,984 --> 00:03:46,252
Oh, uh, I... I meant Iris.

86
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:48,788
Yeah, you're not needed.

87
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,490
I am needed... somewhere.

88
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:52,858
I'ma... go there.

89
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:56,996
What can I do for you?

90
00:03:56,998 --> 00:04:01,033
I just wanted to talk with you,

91
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:04,870
about Barry.

92
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:07,273
I know that Barry's...

93
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,074
you know, practically your brother.

94
00:04:09,076 --> 00:04:10,843
So I understand that your loyalty

95
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:12,912
is obviously to him, not me.

96
00:04:12,914 --> 00:04:16,048
But I was just hoping that
maybe you think I'm good for him,

97
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,017
so you'd want to help me figure him out.

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,786
Well, I mean, if you did that, you...

99
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:22,354
you would be the first.

100
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:23,876
Wonderful. That gives me tons of hope.

101
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:28,394
It's just...

102
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:31,964
he's being not distant, but...

103
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,098
Guarded.

104
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,900
Yeah. He's being guarded.

105
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:37,169
And he's waking up from these bad dreams

106
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,771
and not telling me about them.

107
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:42,041
And I know that we got close really quick.

108
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:46,545
It's just... it's like there's
something holding him back.

109
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,881
Here's the thing about Barry.

110
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:51,650
He has a bad habit of

111
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:54,353
carrying the weight of
the world on his shoulders,

112
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:56,956
burdens that aren't even his to bear.

113
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,657
But he doesn't have to do that with me.

114
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,659
Which is exactly what you should tell him.

115
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:19,378
Hey... no! Absolutely not!

116
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,080
You don't get to throw
somebody else's stuff

117
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,882
when you're pissed off.

118
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:26,919
Thank you.

119
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,960
What is this?

120
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:37,930
Wrong answers.

121
00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:39,632
Maybe you're asking the wrong questions.

122
00:05:39,634 --> 00:05:41,333
What does that mean?

123
00:05:41,335 --> 00:05:43,536
I've been thinking about
this a lot recently.

124
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:46,171
We keep trying to come up
with ways to make Barry faster,

125
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,308
but I still think we can figure
out a way to make Zoom slower.

126
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,776
We tried that already, remember?

127
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:52,444
Those darts didn't slow him down at all.

128
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:54,179
Yeah, I know... I'm not
talking about the darts, okay?

129
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:56,482
The darts clearly didn't
work. They just pissed him off.

130
00:05:56,484 --> 00:05:58,450
I'm talking about something else...

131
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:00,319
a way we can steal Zoom's speed.

132
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,226
How?

133
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,994
The Turtle.

134
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:11,430
As some of you may well know,

135
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:14,667
I've been deeply embroiled
in a secret, one-sided battle

136
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:15,834
with an invisible enemy.

137
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:17,269
No, not the Turtle again.

138
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,204
What? What is the...

139
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,307
- Or who is the Turtle?
- It's Cisco's white whale.

140
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:22,474
Half whale, half turtle.

141
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:23,809
No.

142
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:24,977
Do you see what you're doing, Caitlin?

143
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:25,978
Everybody's confused now.

144
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,279
Get to it.

145
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:28,847
I stumbled upon a few of these cases

146
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,583
when we were looking for the Reverse Flash,

147
00:06:30,585 --> 00:06:32,885
robberies that were seemingly
committed at high speed...

148
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,254
people holding their
beloved items one second.

149
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,122
Those items were gone the next.

150
00:06:37,124 --> 00:06:38,324
Tell me what you see.

151
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:46,065
So he can... what? Stop time?

152
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:47,900
No, no, no. Look at the time code.

153
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:51,136
It's still running.

154
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:53,005
Yeah, okay. So if he's not stopping time,

155
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,473
what is he doing?

156
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:57,443
He's slowing down everything around him.

157
00:06:57,445 --> 00:07:00,679
And that is why we call him the Turtle.

158
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,915
Why have you never mentioned
this guy to me before?

159
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:04,483
Oh, I don't know, I think we've just been

160
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:06,418
a little distracted, you
know, what with Captain Cold

161
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,886
and the Weather Wizard and Gorilla Grodd.

162
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,088
Do I need to go on?

163
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,389
Okay, so if we can catch him,

164
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:12,157
figure out how he uses his powers...

165
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,994
Maybe we can show Zoom what
life is like in the slow lane.

166
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:16,629
How would you even know where to find him?

167
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:18,097
Well, the robberies in the videos

168
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,665
all correspond with police reports

169
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,834
that were dismissed as
lost or missing items

170
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:23,002
instead of thefts.

171
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:24,169
The suspect's M.O. being...

172
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,372
Items of immense personal value.

173
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:38,150
Oh, it appears that there's
a press conference at CCPD,

174
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:40,919
because the Vandervoort diamonds
have just been recovered.

175
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,358
"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee."

176
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,727
The perpetrators who
committed this heartless crime

177
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,130
have been apprehended and
are now in our custody.

178
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:53,599
And we're happy to report that
the famed Vandervoort diamonds

179
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:55,501
have been returned to their rightful owner.

180
00:07:55,503 --> 00:07:58,971
The real gem is the return of
my great-grandfather's ring.

181
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:00,606
Getting that returned to the family

182
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,408
is what's most priceless to me.

183
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,143
Gotcha.

184
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,371
The ring is gone. What happened to it?

185
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:34,773
Lock this place down.
No one leaves this room.

186
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,041
Sweep the precinct!

187
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:43,471
Well, the good new is
whatever the Turtle did,

188
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:45,897
it only affected you temporarily.

189
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,098
Yo.

190
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,933
What was it like being in Turtle Time?

191
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:50,068
Yeah, no, it was weird.

192
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:52,103
It was like waves of inertness...

193
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,838
like all the energy was
suddenly sucked out of my body,

194
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,640
and then it would return.

195
00:08:55,642 --> 00:08:57,375
That's because that's
exactly what was happening.

196
00:08:57,377 --> 00:08:58,876
He has the ability to transfer

197
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:00,812
all the surrounding
kinetic energy into himself.

198
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:02,380
Leaving everyone else in a temporary state

199
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:03,382
of potential energy.

200
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:05,183
That's right.

201
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:06,517
So why could I still move?

202
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,919
Your speed.

203
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:09,420
Your speed allows you to change positions

204
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:10,922
faster than anyone else.

205
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:12,890
So you can convert your
stored potential energy

206
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:14,058
back to kinetic energy.

207
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,360
Excuse me, where are you going?

208
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:16,594
Trying to figure out

209
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,563
how to use this against Zoom.

210
00:09:18,565 --> 00:09:21,199
You remember Zoom?

211
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,967
"Cisco, please join me.

212
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:25,703
We'll use your idea and take
it to new scientific heights

213
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:26,838
and save the world."

214
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,673
Yes, I'd love to!

215
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,608
Okay.

216
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,844
Facial recognition
software found us a match

217
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:34,746
from the press conference footage.

218
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:37,815
The Turtle's name is Russell Glosson.

219
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:40,585
He was a small-time
thief who stopped thieving

220
00:09:40,587 --> 00:09:42,487
after the particle accelerator explosion.

221
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:43,988
All right, I'm gonna head to work...

222
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,323
catch Joe up.

223
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:47,225
Let me know if you find anything else.

224
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:53,531
You okay?

225
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,099
Yeah, yeah, it's just...

226
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:58,403
It's hard to... look at that

227
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:00,905
and not think about how I
can't help people anymore.

228
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:04,375
Well, we have lots of technology here.

229
00:10:04,377 --> 00:10:07,578
Why don't we figure out
how to get your speed back?

230
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,781
I'm a scientist too, Caitlin.

231
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,182
When I first got here,

232
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:14,018
all I did was work on
how to get my speed back.

233
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,056
Believe me, whatever test you could run...

234
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:19,357
I've already done it.

235
00:10:26,232 --> 00:10:27,765
The Turtle.

236
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:30,501
Cisco's been looking for this guy forever.

237
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:32,236
Singh just put an APB out on him.

238
00:10:32,238 --> 00:10:34,939
How did everybody know
about Glosson before I did?

239
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,710
Cisco's got a whole list
of unidentified metas.

240
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:40,144
The boys around here are calling him

241
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:41,479
Cisco de la Mancha.

242
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,651
Are you good? You seem a little jittery.

243
00:10:46,653 --> 00:10:48,619
A little anxious.

244
00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:50,254
Let's be honest.

245
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:52,457
I'm really nervous about this
whole dinner tonight

246
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:53,725
with Wally.

247
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:55,326
Come on, why... why are you nervous?

248
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:57,195
You're, like, the best dad ever.

249
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:58,930
He'll see that.

250
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:01,199
It'll be a whole lot
easier, you being there.

251
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,101
Joe, I wouldn't miss it.

252
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:06,704
- See you tonight.
- All right.

253
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:10,808
Hey, you.

254
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,310
- Hey.
- You got a sec?

255
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:13,778
Yeah.

256
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,279
I just...

257
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:17,949
I just want to make sure everything's okay.

258
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,117
Yeah.

259
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,651
Yeah, I'm... I'm... I...

260
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:21,919
don't want to nag.

261
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:23,121
That's not, you know, who I am.

262
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:25,189
I just...

263
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:28,526
I don't... I don't want you
to feel burdened by anything.

264
00:11:28,528 --> 00:11:29,827
No, I don't.

265
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:32,029
Okay.

266
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:35,400
Hey, wait. Patty, uh...

267
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,301
The New Years was always
a hard time for me.

268
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:40,138
Um... that's when my mom died,
so it's just those memories

269
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,706
all come out, and they're hard to put away.

270
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,107
So if it feels like I
haven't been communicating...

271
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,375
I'm sorry, Barry. I'm sorry.

272
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:45,410
I... I didn't know.

273
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,812
No, no, no, no, no.

274
00:11:47,814 --> 00:11:53,484
Look, we haven't had a
romantic night in a while.

275
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:56,754
What do you say tomorrow night
we get some dinner and drinks

276
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:59,223
and maybe a little... kissing?

277
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:00,858
That sounds like what we need.

278
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,827
Okay. All right, I'll see you later.

279
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:04,662
Okay.

280
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:12,103
Okay, I think we can call it.

281
00:12:12,105 --> 00:12:14,372
Wally is not coming.

282
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm sorry, Joe.

283
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,208
I know how much this meant to you.

284
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,580
He's a kid, right? I get it.

285
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:24,015
He could have at least called.

286
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,583
Well, there could be a number of reasons

287
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:27,752
why he didn't.

288
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:30,087
Thank you for being here.

289
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:31,923
I love you.

290
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,891
Love you.

291
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:36,928
See you in the morning, Bar.

292
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,329
Yeah.

293
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:47,839
Well, West family 2.0 is not
really off to a great start.

294
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:50,408
You've been quiet all evening.

295
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:53,911
The Turtle?

296
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:55,246
How do you know about him?

297
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,450
No...

298
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:02,320
no, I've just had a lot on my mind.

299
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:04,522
Patty?

300
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:08,092
We... we may have met for coffee.

301
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:09,327
Iris...

302
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:11,162
She really cares about you, Barry,

303
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:14,398
and she's just wondering
why you've been so guarded.

304
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,833
And what did you tell her?

305
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:18,469
I told her to talk to you.

306
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:20,638
Oh, that's not cool.

307
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,741
You know, she did mention that...

308
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:26,978
you've been having nightmares.

309
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,481
About Zoom...

310
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:33,317
killing her.

311
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:34,619
Look.

312
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:36,554
I know that things have

313
00:13:36,556 --> 00:13:38,956
been moving pretty fast

314
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,259
between you two.

315
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,729
But you realize you can't keep
things from her forever, right?

316
00:13:44,731 --> 00:13:47,798
One day, you're gonna
have to tell her the truth.

317
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,134
That I'm the Flash?

318
00:13:50,136 --> 00:13:52,236
I can't do that.

319
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:56,140
Barry, I wish a year ago
you had told me the truth.

320
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:58,175
So, what, you think that
I should just tell her?

321
00:13:58,177 --> 00:14:01,345
I think that if you are serious

322
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:03,681
about being with her,

323
00:14:03,683 --> 00:14:05,750
you have to.

324
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,025
All right, then that's what I'm gonna do.

325
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:16,328
I'll tell Patty I'm the Flash.

326
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:27,713
Hey.

327
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:28,948
You guys got anything?

328
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,783
I think we found the next target

329
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:33,986
for our 30-something,
meta-human, not-a-Ninja-Turtle.

330
00:14:33,988 --> 00:14:36,021
How long did it take you
to come up with that one?

331
00:14:36,023 --> 00:14:37,890
It just came out of my
mouth... did you see that?

332
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,158
- That was amazing.
- That was nice.

333
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,559
Central City Museum

334
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:41,927
is hosting a special
black tie event tonight

335
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:44,196
showcasing "The Crystal Ball."

336
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:46,065
It's a famous painting, apparently,

337
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,900
recently recovered from Markovia.

338
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,502
The painting is on loan to the museum

339
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:50,803
from the Silverberg family.

340
00:14:50,805 --> 00:14:52,505
Jacob Silverberg himself said,

341
00:14:52,507 --> 00:14:55,241
"The painting's safe
return means more to us

342
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:57,042
than all the money in the world.

343
00:14:57,044 --> 00:14:58,944
It's like they're begging Turtle to rob it.

344
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:01,180
Okay, yes. This is a plan.

345
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:04,216
So the Turtle will make his move,

346
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:07,453
and we can be there
waiting to take him down.

347
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,321
How do you look in a tux?

348
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,257
Come on, he's 6'2", he's
square-jawed, and he's jacked.

349
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,392
I think he looks fine.

350
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:14,527
I'm 6'4".

351
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,861
Oh, crap!

352
00:15:15,863 --> 00:15:17,630
Problem?

353
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:20,166
No.

354
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,667
No.

355
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:24,036
An opportunity, maybe. Hold on.

356
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:28,874
Hey, you.

357
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:31,043
- I'm excited to see you tonight.
- Yeah, me too.

358
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,946
Actually, about that...
um, so I know I said

359
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:35,881
"let's have dinner," but,

360
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:37,416
you've been wanting me to share more.

361
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:39,785
So I thought that I would share that

362
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:42,555
I love art.

363
00:15:42,557 --> 00:15:44,557
- Okay, interesting.
- Yeah.

364
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:46,625
No, I just, you know, I
can't get enough of art.

365
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:48,494
Anyway, there's this event

366
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,596
at the Central City Museum tonight.

367
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,431
They're showing this really famous painting

368
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:53,933
that I've always loved.

369
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:57,536
Actually, I don't know anything about art,

370
00:15:57,538 --> 00:15:58,671
but what's the saying?

371
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,306
I know what I like,

372
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:01,707
and I like you,

373
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,142
so count me in.

374
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:05,444
All right, great. I'll see you at 8:00.

375
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:06,979
- 7:00!
- Or 7:00.

376
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:09,748
- I'll see you at 7:00.
- Okay, 7:00 it is.

377
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,317
Bye.

378
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,185
You know, you're a
really great superhero...

379
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:14,653
- Thanks.
- A really great superhero...

380
00:16:14,655 --> 00:16:16,522
- Thank you.
- But do you think

381
00:16:16,524 --> 00:16:18,290
it's a good idea when you're fighting crime

382
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,825
to bring a date?

383
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:23,229
I'm gonna tell Patty that I'm the Flash.

384
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:27,066
Is that a bad idea? What do we think?

385
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:30,970
I will say, she put bullets
in King Shark and Harry.

386
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,338
- Yeah.
- So as far as I'm concerned,

387
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,606
that's Team Flash material to me.

388
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:35,641
All right, yes. Thank you, Cisco.

389
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:37,676
Yeah, thank you. Cool.

390
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,278
I'm gonna do this...

391
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,046
I'm gonna tell her.

392
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:46,285
Don't tell her.

393
00:16:46,287 --> 00:16:47,720
Huh?

394
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:54,126
You care for this woman.

395
00:16:54,128 --> 00:16:55,594
That's nice.

396
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:58,597
Then keep her as far away
from this as possible.

397
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:00,099
And here's why.

398
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:03,802
If Zoom finds out who you care for,

399
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:05,771
who you love,

400
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:08,240
who you live for,

401
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,909
he'll take them from you.

402
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,564
All right.

403
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:34,800
Keep your eyes open for the Turtle.

404
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:36,735
A sentence I never thought I would say.

405
00:17:50,351 --> 00:17:52,751
Cisco, are you and Harry in position?

406
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:54,386
I'm the security feed.

407
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,155
I've got the facial
recognition software running,

408
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,424
so we'll be able to spot
Turtle before he makes his move.

409
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:00,359
Turtle.

410
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,194
Why do you insist on giving them

411
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:03,662
ridiculous nicknames?

412
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:05,197
Me?

413
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:08,300
Who's the genius that came up with "Zoom"?

414
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:13,205
Yeah, well...

415
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:20,179
I'll tell you, about two years ago...

416
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:22,848
this is on Earth-2, now.

417
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,384
The CCPD there...

418
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:28,053
they got a 911 call

419
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,189
about a hostage situation,

420
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:32,858
but when the SWAT team got there,

421
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,994
there were no hostages.

422
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:37,162
It was a trap.

423
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:38,931
Zoom set a trap

424
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:43,635
in order to show the police
that they could not stop him.

425
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:47,606
And he killed 14 officers.

426
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:50,943
Men and women. Slaughtered them.

427
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:55,080
Left one alive to tell what happened.

428
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:58,250
That officer described

429
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:00,452
blue lightning

430
00:19:00,454 --> 00:19:02,654
"zooming" all about

431
00:19:02,656 --> 00:19:06,859
as his comrades, brothers
and sisters in arms,

432
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:09,194
were murdered.

433
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:12,097
That officer...

434
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,767
considered himself to be a lucky one,

435
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,369
spared in order to tell the tale.

436
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:23,509
Until Zoom went to his house
that night and killed him too.

437
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:28,113
Anyway, that's how he
got the nickname "Zoom".

438
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:39,124
If you ever need me to Vibe...

439
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:40,626
so you can know if she's still alive...

440
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:44,263
She's alive.

441
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,365
Right.

442
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,075
- No!
- No!

443
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,246
You have a really weird look on your face.

444
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:03,782
- Do I look weird?
- No, no.

445
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:07,453
You... look... like a dream.

446
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,822
You look very handsome.

447
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:13,759
I can't wait to see this painting.

448
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:15,094
What painting?

449
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,595
The painting. Uh, yeah.

450
00:20:16,597 --> 00:20:19,364
Me too, um, yeah.

451
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:22,868
How about we talk first?

452
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,503
I thought you'd never ask.

453
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,944
I can't figure you out, Barry Allen.

454
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,513
That is because I work hard

455
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,682
to hide who I really am.

456
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:39,852
You don't have to hide with me.

457
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:41,653
I just have to

458
00:20:41,655 --> 00:20:44,623
really trust someone

459
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,160
if they're gonna know the truth.

460
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:49,461
Do you?

461
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:53,565
I trust you, Patty.

462
00:20:55,369 --> 00:20:58,704
I trust you, too.

463
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,973
Patty...

464
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:06,311
After I was struck by lightning,

465
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:09,915
when I woke up...

466
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,553
We've got eyes on Turtle.

467
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,425
Barry, you were saying?

468
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,094
I have to go. I'm sorry.

469
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:23,762
What? What?

470
00:21:23,764 --> 00:21:25,197
But Barry...

471
00:21:27,334 --> 00:21:29,601
CCPD! Freeze!

472
00:21:33,774 --> 00:21:36,208
What?

473
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:43,849
Are you as fast as the Flash?

474
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:46,518
Oh, no. He is much slower.

475
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:49,721
This is a trap?

476
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:51,223
I'm slow...

477
00:21:51,225 --> 00:21:52,925
not stupid.

478
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,491
Oh, my God!

479
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,596
I got it. Come on.

480
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:49,635
Your pupils are normal.

481
00:22:49,637 --> 00:22:51,203
Your heart rate's a little low.

482
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,472
But other than that,
no concussive symptoms.

483
00:22:53,474 --> 00:22:55,641
I really do feel fine. What about Turtle?

484
00:22:55,643 --> 00:22:58,110
- No sign of him.
- Or the painting.

485
00:22:58,112 --> 00:23:00,813
He, must have gotten
away with it in the chaos.

486
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:01,914
Yeah, things went a little sideways

487
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,482
after your girlfriend decided

488
00:23:03,484 --> 00:23:05,718
to go all "Lethal Weapon"
1 through 4 on Turtle.

489
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,052
Oh, my God.

490
00:23:07,054 --> 00:23:08,687
Patty's gonna think I ditched her.

491
00:23:08,689 --> 00:23:10,522
I... no, I got to go.

492
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:12,024
Where are you...

493
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,059
finding Turtle is what's
important right now.

494
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:16,562
Yeah, this is important to me too.

495
00:23:16,564 --> 00:23:19,198
But we need to see if
your speed still works.

496
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,899
I think... I think it still works.

497
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:24,103
We still have to find out
how Turtle drained him of it.

498
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,807
Can I talk to you...

499
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,209
for a second?

500
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:41,787
You never got your champagne.

501
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,822
I couldn't find any flutes.

502
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:45,624
Hope that's okay.

503
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:46,925
Of course.

504
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,293
Here you go.

505
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:03,342
Let me go see if I can make myself useful.

506
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,549
I was right.

507
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:46,985
I thought that you would
look mad, and you do.

508
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,988
What happened?

509
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,894
I don't really have a good excuse.

510
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,162
Nothing?

511
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,897
Nothing? I mean, come on, Barry.

512
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,767
Anything is better than nothing.

513
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,402
I mean, come on.

514
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:06,071
Holy crap, I've been a
really, really cool girlfriend.

515
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,073
Most girls don't have the self-esteem

516
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:10,175
to handle the... plans?

517
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,111
Oh, no plans. That's cool.

518
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:13,645
Or the... or the...

519
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:16,448
waking up in the middle of
the night screaming again.

520
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,183
Fine, whatever.

521
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,819
And then... and then the
really, really fancy plans...

522
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,254
which were awesome.

523
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:25,657
And then you ditched me
right before I almost died.

524
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,427
I mean, when you put it that way, it...

525
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:31,330
I'm actually really upset.

526
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:32,965
Yeah, I know.

527
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:34,933
Look, we've been having fun.

528
00:25:34,935 --> 00:25:37,202
And fun has been so great.

529
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:40,038
But... I'm moving past fun

530
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,107
to the close part.

531
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:44,143
That's what I want, okay?

532
00:25:44,145 --> 00:25:45,878
That's where I'm going.

533
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,614
You need to figure out
what it is that you want.

534
00:25:48,616 --> 00:25:51,383
And do it fast.

535
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:58,323
Fast is my specialty.

536
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,090
Yo, pay up.

537
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:24,509
What?

538
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,545
You got someone tailing me now?

539
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:29,548
Why didn't you show up
for dinner last night?

540
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,183
Couldn't make it.

541
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:33,919
You tell someone you're gonna be somewhere,

542
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:36,188
you show up.

543
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:40,225
Guess I didn't have my
dad to teach me that, huh?

544
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:42,995
Is this why you came to Central City?

545
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:45,063
Not to get to know me or your sister,

546
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:47,199
but this nonsense?

547
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:49,768
No one in Keystone will race me anymore.

548
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,704
But I don't actually have
to explain myself to you.

549
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:54,773
Actually, you do.

550
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:57,142
This is illegal. I'm a cop, remember?

551
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:58,710
Oh, yeah. Yes.

552
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:00,979
The detective who didn't know he had a son

553
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:03,181
and who doesn't know anything about me.

554
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:06,485
I am trying to get to know you, Wally.

555
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:08,053
These races... that car...

556
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:11,290
that I won?

557
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:13,859
That's the only way that I can
pay for my mom's hospital bills,

558
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,694
get her the help that she needs.

559
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,562
You don't have to do this.

560
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:19,698
I have money saved. I
can dip into my pension.

561
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,133
I don't need your money.

562
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:24,970
I can take care of myself and my mom, okay?

563
00:28:24,972 --> 00:28:28,006
I'm the man of our house.
That position has been filled.

564
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:34,379
Go home to your family, Joe.

565
00:28:46,427 --> 00:28:48,393
Barry?

566
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,594
Hey...

567
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:09,549
What?

568
00:29:12,152 --> 00:29:14,152
What do you want from me?

569
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:17,022
The thing most precious to the Flash...

570
00:29:17,024 --> 00:29:18,657
you.

571
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:29,150
Patty?

572
00:29:40,997 --> 00:29:42,830
No, no, no, no, no.

573
00:29:42,832 --> 00:29:44,866
No.

574
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:47,768
Come on.

575
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:50,738
No... Joe!

576
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,474
Joe, I think the Turtle has Patty.

577
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:57,345
I... Look, just meet me at
S.T.A.R. Labs, all right?

578
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,137
What do you want from me?

579
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:25,039
I want you to stop moving...

580
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,309
Forever.

581
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:29,810
What do you get out of killing me?

582
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:31,712
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

583
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:35,349
That's much too... fast and messy.

584
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:38,586
I like to take things nice and slow.

585
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,755
You don't have to hurt me
to try to prove a point.

586
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:43,558
This isn't about hurting you.

587
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:47,094
This is about hurting
someone who values you.

588
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:49,730
Who, Barry?

589
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:51,732
No.

590
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:53,134
The Flash.

591
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:55,069
What does he have to do with this?

592
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,075
I saw the way he saved you.

593
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:03,110
Yes, that's what he does.

594
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:04,178
He's a hero.

595
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,247
He saves people who need saving.

596
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,683
That's a waste of time...

597
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:09,850
saving people.

598
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,823
They take everything for granted.

599
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:19,360
So you take the things
that matter most to them.

600
00:31:19,362 --> 00:31:23,231
My wife Rosalyn took me for granted.

601
00:31:23,233 --> 00:31:25,366
She wanted to leave me...

602
00:31:25,368 --> 00:31:26,801
the thing I valued most.

603
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,803
So that's what this is about?

604
00:31:28,805 --> 00:31:31,339
You're hurt because your wife left you?

605
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,276
I couldn't let that happen.

606
00:31:37,714 --> 00:31:39,480
So I made her mine.

607
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,184
Forever.

608
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,513
I do hope I spelled your name right.

609
00:32:15,318 --> 00:32:16,917
Bar... we'll find her.

610
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,586
I'm not getting any leads on this guy.

611
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,288
It's like he's totally fallen off the grid.

612
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,423
You know, it... any of
the stuff he's stolen,

613
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:24,925
- I can't find it.
- He keeps them.

614
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:27,695
He keeps them the way a serial
killer collects trophies.

615
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,263
He's stolen a lot of stuff.

616
00:32:29,265 --> 00:32:31,866
Which means he needs a lot
of space to store it, right?

617
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:33,000
That's where we start.

618
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:35,403
See if he rented any storage spaces.

619
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:37,538
No, no...

620
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,573
I'm not getting anything.

621
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:41,142
Wait a minute.

622
00:32:41,144 --> 00:32:44,545
His ex-wife used to be an
archivist for antiquities

623
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:47,248
at the Naydel Library before it shut down,

624
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,817
and it shut down three months
after the accelerator exploded.

625
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:51,819
That place is big enough
to hold Turtle's stuff.

626
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:53,287
Okay, all right.

627
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:54,689
Wait, Barry... we haven't even figured out

628
00:32:54,691 --> 00:32:56,424
how to neutralize the Turtle's power.

629
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:58,559
Well, I'm gonna have to power through it.

630
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:05,499
All right, I'm outside the library.

631
00:33:05,501 --> 00:33:07,401
Barry, the only way to save Patty

632
00:33:07,403 --> 00:33:09,503
is if you grab her in between
each of the Turtle's pulses.

633
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,372
You'll only have 2/10ths of a second

634
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:12,373
to make your moves.

635
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,841
I got it.

636
00:33:19,782 --> 00:33:21,749
No!

637
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:55,282
Ugghh!

638
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,091
I guess he doesn't care about you

639
00:34:04,093 --> 00:34:07,027
as much as I thought.

640
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:08,496
No...

641
00:34:13,002 --> 00:34:14,869
No, no... please!

642
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:50,037
Ooh!

643
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:56,844
No, it's all right.

644
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:02,683
Thank you. Thank you.

645
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:04,685
Thank you, whoever you are.

646
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,756
It's okay.

647
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:10,758
It's okay.

648
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:22,950
Hey, Turtle.

649
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:28,689
So you want to know my
new definition of irony?

650
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:32,159
Now you... are our most prized possession.

651
00:35:35,231 --> 00:35:37,264
Arrrhhhh!

652
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:41,769
- Patty okay?
- She is, yeah.

653
00:35:53,949 --> 00:35:55,315
Jay?

654
00:35:55,317 --> 00:35:57,284
Yeah?

655
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:01,321
I know.

656
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:03,791
Why didn't you tell me that you're sick?

657
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:07,961
The champagne.

658
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:10,197
You took my DNA off the glass.

659
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,132
You know I lost my husband...

660
00:36:12,134 --> 00:36:15,302
how hard that was for me to move on.

661
00:36:15,304 --> 00:36:16,837
How could you let me get close to you

662
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:19,439
knowing that soon I'd lose you too?

663
00:36:21,677 --> 00:36:23,143
I just...

664
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:27,381
I didn't expect... this.

665
00:36:27,383 --> 00:36:28,515
I didn't expect you.

666
00:36:28,517 --> 00:36:32,052
Then help me find a cure.

667
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:34,021
There is no cure.

668
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:37,691
The only way to save me
is to get my speed back.

669
00:36:37,693 --> 00:36:41,261
And the only way to do
that is to stop Zoom.

670
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:44,031
Then let's stop him.

671
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:47,434
Yeah.

672
00:36:56,545 --> 00:36:58,145
Hey.

673
00:36:58,147 --> 00:37:00,480
I think I left my sweater
here the other night.

674
00:37:00,482 --> 00:37:02,282
It's green.

675
00:37:02,284 --> 00:37:04,418
Oh, yeah.

676
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,887
I thought that didn't look like Barry's.

677
00:37:11,927 --> 00:37:14,194
Heading back to Keystone tonight.

678
00:37:14,196 --> 00:37:15,529
That's a fast trip.

679
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:17,397
Yeah, well, it's getting a little hot

680
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,432
in Central City for me.

681
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:20,000
Don't worry.

682
00:37:20,002 --> 00:37:22,903
I'll try not to run too
many lights on the way there.

683
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:30,244
You know, if you're waiting for an apology,

684
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:31,378
it's not coming.

685
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,547
No.

686
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:35,682
No, I'm... I'm the one that should be

687
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:38,418
apologizing to you.

688
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,954
I felt bad

689
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:44,458
not being there while you
were growing up, and...

690
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,861
I was pushing this whole father-son thing.

691
00:37:47,863 --> 00:37:49,930
I'm sorry.

692
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:52,065
Let's just slow down a bit.

693
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,867
I won't try to be your instant dad,

694
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:55,702
and you won't have to pretend that

695
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,604
you want to be my son.

696
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:03,310
Deal?

697
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:05,779
All that food for you?

698
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:07,381
Doesn't have to be.

699
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:09,449
You like chow mein?

700
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:10,817
No.

701
00:38:13,756 --> 00:38:15,489
But I like kung pao chicken.

702
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:28,902
Initial and sign.

703
00:38:28,904 --> 00:38:31,138
There you go. Thank you, guys.

704
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,539
Patty.

705
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,941
- Hey.
- Hi.

706
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:36,510
Can we talk... like, really talk?

707
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:38,078
Yeah, uh, no.

708
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,746
Now's not really an awesome time.

709
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:41,481
I have a mound of paperwork
on my desk I need to finish,

710
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:42,716
so I'm sorry, I can't.

711
00:38:42,718 --> 00:38:44,184
No, no, okay. Real... really quick.

712
00:38:44,186 --> 00:38:46,253
So you were right.

713
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:48,488
You were right about everything.

714
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,290
I've been closed off and weird,

715
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:53,260
and, all the things
that you said I was.

716
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:57,197
But mostly, I have not been honest.

717
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,167
Barry...

718
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:01,868
I'm leaving Central City.

719
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:06,873
What?

720
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:11,211
Before Mardon, and before my dad...

721
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:12,913
before everything...

722
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:15,849
I always wanted to be a CSI.

723
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:17,484
And four years ago, I was accepted

724
00:39:17,486 --> 00:39:18,819
into the Forensic Science program

725
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:22,456
at Midway City University.

726
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:24,191
That's a really great school.

727
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:25,258
Yeah.

728
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,327
Yeah, I know, I just...

729
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:28,695
I didn't go.

730
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:31,264
You know, I deferred to become a cop and...

731
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:34,267
catch my dad's killer.

732
00:39:34,269 --> 00:39:37,070
And I've done that.

733
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:39,706
So...

734
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,843
so it's time to move on.

735
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:44,845
From the job?

736
00:39:47,282 --> 00:39:49,216
From everything.

737
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:55,155
Patty. Patty...

738
00:39:55,157 --> 00:39:56,556
Pat...

739
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:09,236
Journal log entry number 113.

740
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:14,241
Jess...

741
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:17,544
I'm coming for you soon.

742
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:19,646
I promise.

743
00:40:19,648 --> 00:40:21,815
I was thinking earlier today about the time

744
00:40:21,817 --> 00:40:23,784
that you were four.

745
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:26,253
I took you to the
planetarium, just you and me.

746
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:27,988
I remember because it was the first time

747
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,990
I took you out all by myself.

748
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:31,925
The planetarium was crowded,

749
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:34,628
and you held my hand for dear life,

750
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,830
or maybe it was the other way around.

751
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:39,566
But it was in the Mars
exhibit that I lost you.

752
00:40:39,568 --> 00:40:41,068
Panic.

753
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,836
I had that place locked down in one minute.

754
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:44,771
I had every security guard looking for you.

755
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:47,808
And I could feel the fear
rise in the back of my throat

756
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,510
and something else rising also,

757
00:40:50,512 --> 00:40:55,382
some... dark instinct inside me

758
00:40:55,384 --> 00:40:58,251
about what I would do

759
00:40:58,253 --> 00:41:00,554
to the person who had taken you...

760
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:02,656
the things I would do...

761
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:06,960
Unspeakable things.

762
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:11,131
And it was in that moment that I realized,

763
00:41:11,133 --> 00:41:12,766
for certain,

764
00:41:12,768 --> 00:41:18,405
that I would do anything to get you back.

765
00:41:49,738 --> 00:41:52,205
- Gideon.
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

766
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:54,674
Where the hell am I?
