1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,970
战争要来临了
There is a war coming.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,490
可怕的战争
A-a terrible war.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,920
到时会一片混乱
There-there will be chaos.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,170
街上血流成河
Rivers of blood in the streets.

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,180
我知道的
I know it!

6
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,080
我能预见到
I-I can see it coming.

7
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,720
是时候了
It's time.

8
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,470
总得有人接替他  那不如就让我来
Somebody has to take over; it might as well be me.

9
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,580
我在查这其中的联系
I'm looking for a connection

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,920
阿卡姆规划和我父母案子之间的联系
between the Arkham plan and the murders of my parents.

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,330
马罗尼只要拿到阿卡姆的一块砖
If Maroni gets even a piece of Arkham,

12
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,090
就证明法尔科内不中用了
it'll prove Falcone is weak.

13
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,020
再也别回哥谭了
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

14
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,730
你好啊  詹姆斯
Hello, James.

15
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,570
老朋友
Old friend.

16
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,310
我告诉过你永远别回来
I told you never to come back here!

17
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,910
没人会去找死人
Nobody looks for a dead man.

18
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,000
你想要这份工作吗
So... you want the job, or what?

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,950
是的
Yes.

20
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,530
我要找的不是美女
I ain't looking for no girl.

21
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,270
而是武器
I'm looking for a weapon.

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,980
法尔科内以为他可以在
Falcone thinks he could hit me

23
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,290
我的地盘上滋事  还能安然无事
in my place of business and get away with it?

24
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,500
我要回击
I want to hit him back.

25
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:53,612

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,460
去散步吗
Fancy a stroll?

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,170
今天天气很好
It's a lovely day.

28
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,340
去活动一下腿脚  呼吸点新鲜空气
Stretch the legs, breath of fresh air.

29
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,110
我在忙
Busy.

30
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,190
我想问你一个问题  布鲁斯少爷
I've got a question for you, Master Bruce.

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,620
万一所有这一切
What if all this

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,830
都只是在浪费时间呢
was a complete and utter bloody waste of time?

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,960
万一你永远找不到杀害你父母的凶手呢
What if you never discovered who killed your mom and dad?

34
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,170
万一你永远没机会报仇呢
What if you never get to wreak revenge?

35
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,500
我不想报仇
I don't want revenge.

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,710
我是想搞明白这里面的门道
I want to understand how it all works.

37
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,350
哥谭的运行机制
How Gotham works.

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,480
你拿个茶匙从这里
Well, you'd have more chance

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,710
挖到地球另一端的中国都更容易些
digging to China with a teaspoon.

40
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,850
就拿阿卡姆项目来说
Take the Arkham project for instance.

41
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,750
法尔科内和马罗尼的犯罪集团
How did the Falcone and Maroni

42
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,480
是如何在交易中拿到如此大的份额的
crime families get such big shares in the deal?

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,450
我是说
I mean,

44
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,950
我知道市政府腐败成性
I know City Hall is corrupt,

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,490
可韦恩集团就不能做点什么吗
but why didn't Wayne Enterprises do something?

46
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,930
把那个蓝色的文件夹递给我好吗
Can you pass me that blue folder over there?

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,580
好吧  作为爱好
Well, I suppose as hobbies go,

48
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,590
这是比把自己
this is damn sight better

49
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,750
当猪扒一样放在火上烤要好得多
than grilling yourself like a bloody pork chop.

50
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,290
不过  还是不怎么健康  你说呢
Still, not particularly healthy, is it?

51
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,190
谢谢
Thank you.

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,490
你有在听我说吗
Are you listening to me?

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,610
当然
Y-Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

54
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,380
我一会儿再去散步
I'll take a walk later.

55
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,490
谢谢你  阿尔弗雷德
Thank you, Alfred.

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,100
我在阿卡姆项目上分到了一杯羹
I won a piece of Arkham.

57
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,900
我逼市长就范
I strong-armed the mayor.

58
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,610
让法尔科内认输了
I made Falcone back down.

59
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,220
你还说我不能抢一个破赌场吗
And you're telling me that I can't rob a lousy casino?

60
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,410
萨尔  赌场是法尔科内的心肝宝贝
Sal, the casino is Falcone's pride and joy.

61
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,650
这样做意义何在
I mean, what's the point?

62
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,980
就为了几千块钱去招惹法尔科内吗
For a few thousand bucks, why mess with Falcone?

63
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,600
就是要这个效果
That's the point.

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,320
目的就是要招惹法尔科内
Messing with Falcone.

65
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,730
我要他和他的人都知道  我们是不会服软的
I want him and his people to know we're not backing off.

66
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,330
阿卡姆只是一个开始
Arkham was only the beginning.

67
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,290
我们要接手这里  弗兰克
We're taking over, Frankie.

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,590
一步一步来
Inch by inch.

69
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,480
好吧  可是
Okay, but...

70
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,840
没有可是
But, but, but!

71
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,660
去想办法
Make it happen.

72
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
是  老板
Okay, boss.

73
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,310
你在看什么
What are you looking at?

74
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,780
你有话要讲吗
You got something to say?

75
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,850
没有  先生
No, sir.

76
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,120
完全没有
Nothing at all.

77
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,770
何必撒谎  我要钱买毒品

78
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,690
收好了  伙计
Here you go, buddy.

吸食

85

要付钱的
You got to pay for that!

86
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,190
别惹我  你个凡人
Do not vex me, mortal.

87
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,660
随你吧  宙斯
Suit yourself, Zeus.

88
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,250
说这话有点多余了
Hey, might look like the heel of a hobo's shoe--

89
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,430
这里有市中心最好的汉堡  对吗  以法连
best burgers in Midtown. Huh, Ephraim?

90
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,220
你说是就是吧
If you say so.

91
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,370
给我两个芝士汉堡
All right, I want two cheeseburgers,

92
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,050
不放酱汁  多加点酸黄瓜  再来两杯麦芽奶昔
uh, hold the sauce, extra pickles, two malted shakes.

93
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,230
我的请不要加酸黄瓜
No pickles on mine, please.

94
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,130
这你可得信我  吉姆
Oh, you got to trust me on this one, Jim.

95
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,510
是吗  好吧
Yeah? All right.

96
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,960
那就加上吧
Pickles, bring 'em.

97
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,820
你想等夏天穿泳裤时
All right, now, you want to look good

98
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,650
像我身材一样棒的话
in a swimsuit like me come summertime,

99
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,550
就得多吃这两样东西
you're gonna want a lot of this and a lot of this, huh?

100
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,610
真的吗
Is that right?

101
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,340
是你
You!

102
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,280
吉姆

得了  现在是午餐时间  放松

我们在...现在是午餐时间
We're on our... It-it's lunch!

107
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,770
饶了我吧大哥
Oh, brother.

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,220
吉姆  你别每次一听到警报响就炸毛
Jim, can't just pop up and jump every time you hear a bell.

109
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,800
哥谭市警局  有人在吗
GCPD! Anybody here?

110
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,080
这边  这边
Over... over here.

111
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:35,470
你没事吧  先生
You all right, sir?

112
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,400
没受伤吧
You okay?

113
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,340
谢天谢地你们来了
Thank God you're here.

114
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,670
有人丧命吗
Anybody dead?

115
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,050
应该没有
I don't think so.

116
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,470
那人在偷喝牛奶
Some guy, he was stealing milk.

117
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,640
我想制止他
I try to stop him,

118
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,800
他却把我的自动取款机拖走了
he hauls away my ATM machine.

119
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,360
好吧  既然没人死
All right, nobody dead.

120
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,330
而我们是凶案组的  现在又是午餐时间
We're homicide, and it's lunch.

121
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,300
所以只能祝您日安了  先生
So have a good day, sir.

122
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,400
打电话报警  自然会有人来帮你
Call 911, and someone will take good care of you.

123
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,620
等等  等等  只有一个人
Wait a minute, wait a minute. One guy did this?

124
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,110
为了几瓶牛奶就偷走你的ATM机
Stole your ATM over milk?

125
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,430
那人瘦瘦小小的
Little skinny-ass dude.

126
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,690
拿着吉他盒
Guitar case.

127
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,070
跟奶牛都死光了似的猛喝牛奶
Drinking milk like there's no more cows.

128
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,470
他说"别惹我  你个凡人"
"Don't vex me, mortal," He says.

129
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,390
抱歉  他说什么
Sorry, what?

130
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,210
听我说  如果每次有个把自己
Listen, if I had a dollar for every hobo skeez

131
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,350
当上帝的痞子走进门  我都能得到一美元
that walks through that door, thinks they're God,

132
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,850
我就不用苦逼开店了
I wouldn't be here.

133
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,130
但这个混蛋  他可不是闹着玩的
But this son of a bitch, he wasn't fooling around.

134
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,620
好吧  你能描述一下他的车
All right, you get a description of the vehicle,

135
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,750
车牌之类的吗
license plate, something?

136
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,630
他没有车
He didn't have a vehicle.

137
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,720
那他怎么把你的ATM从墙上拽下来的
Then how'd he pull your ATM from the wall?

138
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,870
他怎么拿走的
How'd he take it away?

139
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,320
我说的就是这个啊  伙计
That's what I'm telling you, man.

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,850
他就是赤手空拳地把机器拉走的
He pulled it out of here with his bare hands.

141
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,580
哥谭
第一季  第五集

142
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,530
《哦  我亲爱的爸爸》
--普契尼

143
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,670
无聊死了
I'm bored.

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,290
可怜的小宝贝啊
Poor little baby girl.

145
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,460
一直窝在这儿
Cooped up in here all the time.

146
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,770
你想要点刺激
You want some excitement.

147
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,580
是啊  我们能不能出去转转
Yes, I do. Can we just go somewhere and...?

148
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,250
这样如何
How's that?

149
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,540
够刺激吗
Excited now?

150
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,860
干吗打我
What'd you do that for?

151
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,440
我为什么选中了你
Why are you here with me?

152
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,590
因为我是你的秘密武器
I'm your secret weapon.

153
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,950
没错
Exactly.

154
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,840
但你有没有在帮我完善你自己呢
But are you helping me help you?

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,550
没有
No, you're not.

156
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,490
你连个曲子都学不好
You won't even learn the damn tune.

157
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,720
我告诉你了  这很重要
I told you this is important.

158
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,170
对不起  妈妈
I'm sorry, mama.

159
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,710
我不是你妈妈
I'm not your mama.

160
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:34,780
你虽说是我的小宝贝  但我不是你妈妈
Now, you might be my baby girl, but I'm not your mama.

161
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,090
你还不够格
Not yet.

162
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,410
这你得努力争取
You have to earn that.

163
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,820
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

164
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,010
这家伙是谁
Who is this guy?

165
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,150
还没查到身份
No positive I.D.

166
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,890
现在只知道他是个流浪汉
As of yet, he's a street guy.

167
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,630
我们认为应该是这东西导致了
We think that this thing has something to do with his...

168
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,540
他过分亢奋
excessive joie de vivre.

169
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,700
我们在嫌疑人的吉他盒里找到了这个
Yeah, we found it in the suspect's guitar case.

170
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,090
是种药品
It's some kind of drug.

171
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,010
一剂药有这效果
A drug did that?

172
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,700
尼格玛发现了少量残留药物
Nygma found traces of the drug.

173
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,080
他明早就能查出这究竟是什么鬼东西
He'll have a read on what the hell this thing is by tomorrow morning.

174
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,160
我们会去查大力士的身份
Meantime, we'll try and ID The strong man.

175
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,270
我知道你们的家族都有不满
I know your families are upset.

176
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,890
不过让他们放心
But tell them

177
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,230
人人都能在阿卡姆项目中分一杯羹
everybody got a piece of the Arkham project.

178
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,790
这是个商业策略
It was a business decision.

179
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,840
我们没输  马罗尼也没赢
We didn't lose, Maroni didn't win.

180
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
但马罗尼觉得他赢了
Maroni thinks he won.

181
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,730
他觉得他大赢特赢了
He thinks he won a great battle.

182
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,330
我们得煞煞他的威风
We need to hurt him.

183
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,130
不行
No.

184
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,550
如果我们不强硬反击  他就会觉得...
If we don't push back hard, he's going to think...

185
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,610
尼克拉  那个蠢货只是被我牵着鼻子走罢了
Nikolai, that fool will think what I want him to think.

186
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,740
现在不要反击
No push back, not yet.

187
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,000
我们国家有一句俗话
In my country, we say,

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,850
即使是蠢货  有了牙齿  照样咬得了国王
"Even a fool may bite the king, if he has teeth."

189
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,070
少说点什么俗语吧  尼克
Can the folklore, Niko.

190
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,250
我们不在你的小破国家
We're not in your godforsaken country.

191
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,290
这儿是哥谭市  这里有管道设置  电力
We are here in Gotham, where we have plumbing, electricity,

192
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,750
还有法尔科内阁下做老大
and Don Falcone is the boss.

193
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,590
他对马罗尼是放长线钓大鱼  闭嘴吧你
He's playing that cluck Maroni on a long line. Done!

194
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,250
这么生气干吗  菲什
Why so angry, Fish?

195
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,860
我有话直说  这也有罪吗
I speak my mind. Is no crime.

196
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,100
而且我向你保证  我们国家
And I assure you, in my country,

197
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,640
也有全部的现代化设施
we have all modern conveniences.

198
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,320
唯一的区别在女人
Only difference: ladies.

199
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,180
她们都待在厨房  或是床上
Ladies are in kitchen or in bed,

200
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,910
这就因人才能而异了
depending on their talents.

201
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,430
你妈妈做菜肯定很差劲
I bet your mother was a lousy cook.

202
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,760
别谈论我妈妈
Don't speak of my mother.

203
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,380
不然怎样
Or what?

204
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,160
你要打女人吗
You gonna hit a lady?

205
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,190
够了
That's enough.

206
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,060
大家不要闹不和
There'll be no bad blood here.

207
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,050
对不起  法尔科内阁下
My apologies, Don Falcone.

208
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,800
我们需要彼此
We need each other.

209
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,660
我们是一家人
We're family.

210
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:23,050
打扰一下  有见过这个人吗
Excuse me. You seen this guy by chance?

211
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,840

见过  我认识他
Yeah, I know him.

217
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,990

是个吉他手
He's a guitar player.

219
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,070
吸毒成瘾
Strung out like string.

220
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,000
他干了什么
What'd he do?

221
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,290
没干什么坏事
Uh, nothing bad.

222

其实他继承了一笔遗产

223
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,080
-此前没人知道  -没错

还有农场和马匹  真的很不错
Farm, horses, real nice.

和酒店情况一样
Same as the bodega.

230

这么多牛奶是怎么回事
Yeah, what's with all the dairy products?

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,860
先生
Sir?

232
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,000
哥谭市警局
GCPD.

233
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,450
把双手举起来
Let me see those hands.

234

可现在我好难受
And now I-I don't feel so good.

240
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,690
不太对劲
Something's wrong.

241
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,130
我要更多

我说了别碰我
I said no!

255

256
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,570
搞什么
What the hell?

257
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,570
如果这药传开  肯定不可收拾
God help us if that drug gets out.

258
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,910
瞧瞧这里乱成了什么样
Will you look at this shambles?

259
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,040
如果你妈妈还在世会怎么说
What would your mother say?

260
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,600
知道吗  我很想
You know, I have a half a mind to

261
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,030
把这些东西都扔进火里
stick all this lot straight into the bloody fire.

262
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,890
不要
No fire.

263
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:12,130
走着瞧
We'll see about that.

264
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,530
赶快起来吧
Come on, up you get.

265
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,510
韦恩集团明天要举办一场慈善午宴
Wayne Enterprises is hosting a charitable luncheon tomorrow.

266
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,940
我擅自代表你接受了他们的
And I took the liberty of accepting their kind invitation

267
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,420
盛情邀请  布鲁斯少爷
on your behalf, Master Bruce.

268
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,240
很好
Good.

269
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,720
有早餐吃吗
Is there breakfast?

270
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,870
嗯  我去给你煎个蛋吧
Yeah, I'll make you an egg.

271
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,970
你的意思是要去吗
Does that mean you'll go?

272
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,730
是的
Yes.

273
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,790
我有一些问题要问董事会
I have some questions I need to ask the members of the board.

274
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,980
什么样的问题
What kind of questions?

275
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,170
关于阿卡姆的问题
About Arkham.

276
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,280
看起来那些黑帮的股权
It seems very likely those gangsters were actually

277
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,000
都是韦恩集团提供的
given their shares in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.

278
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
生意就是这么做的  不是吗
Well, that's how business is done, isn't it?

279
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,280
是吗
Is it?

280
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,220
我父母不是这么做生意的
M-My parents didn't do business that way.

281
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,650
对吗
Did they?

282
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,760
对
No.

283
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,750
他们不这么做  布鲁斯少爷
No, they didn't, Master Bruce.

284
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,560
当然  董事会也许根本就不知情
The board might not know, of course.

285
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,160
他们用了很多巧妙的掩盖手段
There's quite a bit of clever camouflage used.

286
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,330
空壳公司  海外账户等等
Shell companies, offshore accounts and so forth.

287
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,140
好吧  那么你
Right. So, you-you've...

288
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,810
就是研究这些发现的吗
learned all that from all this, did you?

289
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,480
调查工作做的真棒
Fantastic detective work.

290
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,200
但是  我还是很想把这些
I still, however, want to get the whole lot

291
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,020
都一把火烧了
and chuck it straight in the fire.

292
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,350
什么都不要烧掉  阿尔弗雷德
Don't put anything in the fire, Alfred.

293
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,650
这是命令
That's an order.

294
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,970
是  布鲁斯少爷
Right, Master Bruce.

295
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,140
什么都不烧
Nothing in the fire.

296
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,960
重大新闻

297
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,620
我们在哥谭市中心现场直播
We are live in downtown Gotham

298
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,660
一种新型致命毒品正传入大街小巷
where a deadly new drug has hit the streets.

299
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,900
该毒品被称为"毒蛇"  使用者
Nicknamed "Viper," users of this mystery drug

300
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,920
将力大无比并获得充满力量的快感
acquire great strength and a euphoric sense of power,

301
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:53,510
{\an8}"毒蛇"袭击哥谭

302
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,170
但此状态只能持续几小时
but only for a few brief hours.

303
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,990
之后无一例外地都以极其悲惨的方式死去
Then, without exception, they die a horrible death.

304
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,360
放我出去
Let me out!

305
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,470
-快走  -放开我
- Come on! - Get off me!

306
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,540
放开我
Let go of me!

307
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,160
别拿你的脏手碰我
Get your crummy hands off me!

308
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,940
简直非凡无比
It's really quite remarkable.

309
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,190
毒蛇通过某种方式触发了未使用的DNA
Viper somehow activates unused DNA.

310
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,580
使身体开始将骨骼中的钙质当做燃料消耗
The body starts to burn calcium from the skeletal system as fuel.

311
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,720
导致受害者对牛奶和奶酪产生强烈渴求
Hence the victims' cravings for milk and cheese.

312
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,770
因为他们亟需补充被消耗的钙质
They're desperately trying to replace the missing calcium.

313
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,470
但是补充入不敷出
But they can't consume enough.

314
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,620
最终
Essentially,

315
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,490
他们的骨头会碎掉
their bones crumble.

316
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,180
于是导致他们窒息而死
Then they suffocate and die.

317
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,860
你以前见过这种东西吗
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

318
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,800
没有  谁也没见过  完全是新东西
No. Nobody has. Totally new.

319
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,490
我激动的心情简直无以言表
I cannot tell you how thrilled I am to be...

320
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,420
已经几小时没有新案件了
No new reports for a few hours now.

321
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,030
也许结束了  也许他们没这种药了
Maybe they're done. Maybe they ran out of the stuff.

322
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,990
恐怕并非如此
I doubt it.

323
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,310
谁会在街上散播这种东西啊
Who would put this on the street?

324
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,130
目的又是什么
Why?

325
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,390
甚至都不是在卖
Th-They're not even selling it.

326
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,530
完全是免费赠送的
They're giving it away.

327
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,970
就是这么创造市场需求
That's how you create demand.

328
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,230
为一种迅速致命的毒药吗
For a drug that kills you that fast?

329
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,110
但死前能让你觉得自己是世界之王
Well, first it makes you king of the world.

330
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,310
肯定会有人要的
There'll be takers.

331
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,610
绝对会造成伤害
There'll be mayhem, that's for sure.

332
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,980
但都是针对游民
But it's skell-on-skell mayhem.

333
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,850
如果我们让好市民都乖乖在家待几周
If we keep the decent citizens indoors for a couple of weeks,

334
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,010
不去管那些混蛋
let the scumbags have at it,

335
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,100
犯罪就终结了
voila - the end of crime.

336
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,800
设想真不错
Yeah, that's a nice thought.

337
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,810
但是不行
But no.

338
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,700
这东西不容易制造吧
This stuff seems hard to make, no?

339
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,410
这需要复杂精巧的技术
Oh, it takes a high level of technical sophistication.

340
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,250
是最先进的实验室造出来的
A state-of-the-art lab made this stuff.

341
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,860
哥谭最大最好的实验室是哪个
Okay, so who has the biggest and best lab in the city?

342
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,790
最好的是韦赞制药
The best is WellZyn.

343
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,280
但这肯定与他们无关
But this is not them.

344
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,310
他们是韦恩集团的子公司
They're a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.

345
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,560
身价数十亿的大企业
Multibillion-dollar corporation.

346
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,080
有什么理由干这种事呢
Why would they be doing this?

347
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,340
不知道  但不妨就从顶端开始排查吧
I don't know, but we might as well start at the top.

348
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,110
抓住她  抓住她
Grab her! Grab her!

349
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,920
-别乱动  -放开我
- Come on, here! - Let go of me!

350
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,670
放开我  放开我
Get off me! Get off me!

351
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,630
太赞了
Fascinating.

352
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,000
太赞了
Fascinating!

353
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,250
爆炸性新闻  混乱持续...
Breaking news. Continued mayhem...

354
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,550
或许我该雇那人去拿下赌场
Maybe I should hire that guy to take the casino.

355
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,400
也许你该吸点"毒蛇"  鼓鼓勇气
Maybe you should snort some Viper, grow a pair.

356
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,920
不管怎样  我要拿下那个赌场
Either way, I want that casino taken.

357
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,590
没问题  我们会拿下的
Sure, we'll take it.

358
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,500
那里防守严密  有10个武装守卫
I mean, it's tight as a nut-- ten armed guards

359
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,010
防爆门  监视器
blast-proof doors, cameras.

360
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,360
我们会损失几个人  但我们会拿下那里的
We're gonna lose a few guys, but we'll take it.

361
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,450
打扰一下  先生们
Excuse me, gentlemen.

362
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,470
我听到了你们关于赌场的谈话
I couldn't help but overhear your conversation regarding the casino.

363
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,220
管好你自己的事
Go mind your business.

364
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,140
对不起  当然了  真对不起
I'm sorry. Of course. So sorry.

365
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,980
不
No.

366
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,560
告诉我  赌场怎么了
Tell me, what about the casino?

367
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,010
我认识赌场锅炉房的看门人
I know a janitor who runs the boiler room of the casino.

368
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,700
我相信他能轻易带你们进去
He could get you inside quite easily, I believe.

369
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,020
有一些没人知道的通道
There are access tunnels that nobody knows about.

370
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,850
通道
Access tunnels?

371
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,640
坐下  到这儿来
Sit down. Come here.

372
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,610
谢谢您  先生  这真是天大的荣幸
Thank you, sir. A great honor indeed.

373
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,630
你叫什么来着
What's your name again?

374
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,250
这儿的人都喊我"企鹅"  先生
Everyone here calls me Penguin, sir.

375
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,240
你不喜欢这名字  是吧
You don't like that name, huh?

376
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,110
好吧  你错了
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

377
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,670
这是个好名字
It's a good name.

378
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,550
很称你
Works for you.

379
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,220
你是怎么认识这个看门人的
So how do you know this man? The janitor?

380
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,270
我有些人脉
I have connections.

381
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,060
他可靠吗
Reliable, is he?

382
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,010
我觉得我可以说服他可靠点
I think I can persuade him to be.

383
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,210
老大  这人就是个穿西装的洗碗工
Boss, this guy is a dishwasher in a suit.

384
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,440
淡定
Relax.

385
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,590
是这样吗  企鹅
Is that right, Penguin?

386
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,090
你只是个洗盘子的吗
Are you just a dishwasher?

387
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,070
因为我觉得不像
'Cause I don't get that vibe.

388
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,150
你表面上毕恭毕敬  但是...
You come off as all humble, but...

389
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,450
你心里不安分  是吧
you got a little player in you, huh?

390
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,850
您真会看人啊  先生
That's very perceptive of you, sir.

391
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,780
我猜这就是您能被尊称为"阁下"的原因
I guess that's why you're the don.

392
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,250
我不是个洗盘子的
I'm not a dishwasher.

393
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,550
而且  可以说  我不是第一回干这个了
And this isn't my first rodeo, so to speak.

394
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,170
你以前干过  是吧
So, you've rode some bulls, huh?

395
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,560
我就知道
I knew it.

396
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,240
那就说来听听吧  牛仔
Well, tell all, cowboy.

397
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,510
我的真名叫奥斯瓦尔德・科波特
Well, my real name is Oswald Cobblepot.

398
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,740
我觉得等您听了我的故事
And I think that once you hear my story,

399
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,660
您就会认同我能成为您的得力手下  先生
you'll agree that I could be a great asset for you, sir.

400
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,380
是个很长很有趣的故事
It's a long, funny story really.

401
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,730
但以免吓着您  最重要的是...
But the headline, just so you're not surprised...

402
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,440
我以前为菲什・穆尼工作
I used to work for Fish Mooney.

403
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,680
菲什・穆尼
Fish Mooney?

404
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,450
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

405
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,710
我参与过不少法尔科内家族的生意
I was privy to many aspects of the Falcone family business.

406
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,250
-直到他们试图杀我  -这样啊...
- Until they tried to kill me. - Yeah, well...

407
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,970
没想到吧
Hello.

408
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,160
可以说...
Suffice it to say...

409
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,200
还真是个有趣的故事
That is a funny story.

410
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,310
我是泰勒・里斯
I'm Taylor Reece,

411
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,340
韦赞制药公关部的总顾问
general counsel, public relations for WellZyn.

412
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,890
早上好  先生们
Good morning, gentlemen.

413
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,760
多谢替我们省趟跑腿了
Thank you for saving us a trip.

414
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,350
我们一听说你们的调查就赶来了
We were en route as soon as we were apprised of your inquiries.

415
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,920
韦赞制药致力于营造良好的社区关系
WellZyn is committed to good community relations.

416
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,100
你对"毒蛇"有什么了解
What do you know about Viper?

417
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,610
只知道新闻上说的那些
Only what we see on the news.

418
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,790
韦赞制药和这起悲剧毫无关系
WellZyn has no connection to this tragedy.

419
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,830
我们会大力采取法律手段
We will vigorously pursue legal action

420
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,010
追究那些提出相反论调的人的责任
against any individuals making assertions to the contrary.

421
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,780
我们需要按按钮
Do you think we push a button

422
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,050
还是她能自动倒带
or does she just rewind automatically?

423
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,780
我们在找一名韦赞制药的员工
We're looking for an employee of WellZyn's.

424
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,780
一名耳朵严重受伤的男性
Male with a severely damaged ear.

425
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,910
是的
Y-Yes.

426
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:17,640
我要说明  你说的这人我的确有印象
Full disclosure-- that does raise a flag.

427
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,630
这是斯坦・波托斯基
That's Stan Potolsky.

428
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,480
他作为生化学家在我们公司做了几年
He worked for us for several years as a biochemist.

429
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:34,330
主要负责一些个人护理用品
Uh, primarily personal care products.

430
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,380
洗发水  牙膏之类的
Shampoos, toothpastes.

431
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,450
后来发生了什么事
So what happened?

432
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,940
斯坦觉得自己的工作不够重要而倍感受挫
Well, Stan was frustrated that he wasn't doing more important work.

433
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,780
他日渐不满  情绪不稳定
He grew disgruntled and unstable.

434
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,260
我们想给他找医生  但他拒绝了
We tried to get him help, but he resisted.

435
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,930
去年4月  出了件事
Last April, there was an incident.

436
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,440
他因为跟上司起争执
He tried to cut off his own ear

437
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,180
试图割掉自己的耳朵
during a disagreement with his supervisor.

438
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,300
看来没他想得那么容易
Guess it was harder than he thought.

439
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,270
我们不得不解雇他
We had to let him go.

440
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,200
知道他住址吗
Last known address?

441
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,770
他被解雇后
Well, after he was terminated,

442
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:06,950
都没回来收拾办公桌
he didn't even clear off his desk.

443
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,120
直接不见了  没人找得到他
Just disappeared, off the grid.

444
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,680
你早就知道  是不是
You knew, didn't you?

445
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,760
你知道是他
You knew all along it was him.

446
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,800
所以你急忙赶来警局
That's why you came to see us so fast.

447
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,320
不是这样的
That's incorrect.

448
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,330
只有装备先进的实验室才能制出"毒蛇"
Viper can only be produced in a state-of-the-art lab,

449
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,860
比如你们的实验室
like yours.

450
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,230
斯坦・波托斯基是个聪明人
Stan Potolsky is a brilliant man,

451
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,510
完全有能力建他自己的实验室
perfectly capable of building his own lab.

452
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,450
不过欢迎你们来检查我们的设施
But you are more than welcome to examine our facilities.

453
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:33,920
当然得有合适的许可
With full and proper clearances, of course.

454
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,310
当然
Of course.

455
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,280
我们这就去准备文件
We'll get the paperwork started.

456
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,560
律师
Lawyers.

457
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,130
都是人渣
Scumbags, the lot of them.

458
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,550
有一些吧
Yeah, some of them.

459
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,860
去找斯坦・波托斯基吧
Let's go find Stan Potolsky.

460
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,530
怎么  难道开车到处乱转吗
What, drive around looking for him?

461
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,030
不  我让调度发全境通告
No. I'll call dispatch, have them put out an APB.

462
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,270
好  那我去前台
All right, I'll check with the desk,

463
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,620
看有没有人提过他
see if his name's come up.

464
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,450
你是戈登吧
Gordon, right?

465
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,520
是的  你是谁
Yeah. Who the hell are you?

466
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,240
你乖乖地马上跟我走
You got to come with me now, nice and quiet like.

467
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,400
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

468
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,290
放松  我们有个共同的朋友

469
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,490
是吗  是谁
Oh, yeah, who's that?

470
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,460
奥斯瓦尔德・科波特
Oswald Cobblepot.

471
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,400
没错  就是他
Yeah, him.

472
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:10,480
你现在要是不跟我走
And if you don't come with me now,

473
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,890
我们就砍下他的头
we're gonna put his head in a bag

474
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,690
然后寄给法尔科内
and send it to Falcone,

475
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,490
这样你就尴尬了  对吗
which would be embarrassing for you, no?

476
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,790
或许是我们被耍了
Or maybe we've been misinformed.

477
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,850
要是你对他毫无印象
I mean, if I'm not ringing any bells here,

478
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:23,440
你可以不用理会
you can go on your merry way.

479
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,450
不  我跟你走
No, I'll come.

吉姆  说实话就好
Jim, just tell the truth.

487
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,070
要喝一杯不  吉姆

我在喝尼格龙尼[意大利鸡尾酒]

491
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,370
我们这位朋友讲了个精彩的故事
So, our friend here told me a fascinating story.

492
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,890
从没听过这么棒的故事
Never heard a story so good.

493
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,280
很难相信是真的
It's hard to believe it's true.

494
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,140
真的  是真的
It is, it's true.

495
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,210
闭嘴  闭嘴
Shut up! Shut up!

496
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,030
再说一句  我就把这个塞你喉咙里
One more word, and I'll jam this down your throat.

497
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,200
我也想客气点  吉姆
I try to be civil, Jim.

498
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,530
但我这人一句话不说两遍
But I'm not the kind of man that likes to ask twice.

499
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,910
所以我们这么办...
So here's how it's gonna go.

500
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,800
且慢  马罗尼先生  我不知道...
Slow down, Mr. Maroni. I don't know...

501
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,850
住口
No! No. No.

502
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,220
先让我说完
You let me finish.

503
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,400
有你说话的机会
You'll have your turn to speak.

504
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,630
好了
Okay, then.

505
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,870
我要你给我讲个故事
I want you to tell me the same exact story

506
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,510
要和企鹅讲的一模一样
that Penguin told me.

507
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,030
什么故事
What story is that?

508
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,210
你最好清楚  我的朋友
Oh, you better know what story, my friend.

509
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,900
因为如果你们俩说的故事一样
Because if you tell me the same story he told me,

510
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,710
我就可以相信它的真实性
then I could believe it's true.

511
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,390
我就会高兴
Then I'm happy.

512
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,270
但你们要是说的不一样  妈妈哟
But if you tell me another story, oh, mama.

513
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,100
就说明有人对我撒谎
Then someone's lying to me.

514
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,370
我不知道谁在撒谎  你们俩都别想活
And I don't know which one, and the both of youse will die.

515
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,530
-懂了吗  -懂了
- Understand? - Yes, I do.

516
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,790
很好
Good.

517
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,970
那么
So...

518
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,650

我们当时根本不认识...
We didn't even know each other then...

522
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,920
我怎么说的
What did I say?!

523
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,000
把他放到切片机上
Go put him on the slicer.

524
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,670
不要  不要

525
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,260
如果我不满意我听到的  就把他的脸绞烂
If I don't like what I hear, slice his face prejute.

526
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,100
抱歉

联手陷害马里奥・佩珀为韦恩案凶手

她是科波特先生当时的雇主

589
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,900

他是我的学生
He was a student of mine.

617
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,190
十分聪明
A very brilliant student.

618
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,370
你们这些年一直保持联系
And you've stayed in touch over the years.

619
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,330
是的
We have.

620
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,860
他虽然是生物化学家
He may be a biochemist,

621
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,430
但哲学是他的爱好
but philosophy is a passion of his.

622
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,620
你能跟我们说说韦赞制药解雇他的事吗
What can you tell us about WellZyn firing him?

623
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,600
为韦赞制药做的研究
Research for WellZyn

624
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,720
让他进入了阴暗的道德角落
led him into some dark moral corners.

625
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,230
韦赞说他是做洗发水的
WellZyn said he made shampoo.

626
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,030
这有什么好阴暗道德角落的
Where are the dark moral corners in that?

627
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,020
洗发水
Shampoo?

628
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,210
他们是这么说的
They say that, do they?

629
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,070
不不  斯坦设计
No, no, Stan designed

630
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,400
药物武器
pharmaceutical weapons

631
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,480
给作战部队使用
to be used by combat troops.

632
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,170
这种药对人产生后生作用
Drugs that worked on an epigenetic level.

633
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,030
想象下  一支军队  其士兵无比强壮
Imagine an army made up of soldiers so strong

634
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,550
他们可以用双手将人撕碎
that they can tear a man apart with their bare hands.

635
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:35,510
当然  起初  药是有副作用的
Of course, at the beginning, there were side effects.

636
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,760
是啊  死亡
Yeah, death.

637
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,330
但毒蛇只是首批药物
But Viper was the first batch.

638
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,980
第二版中他们做了改良
They worked out the kinks in the second version.

639
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,710
并称之为毒液
Called it Venom.

640
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:49,080
到那时  斯坦有些想通了
By then, Stan had acquired some clarity.

641
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,000
他向上司请求中止这一项目
He appealed to his bosses to end the program.

642
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,200
他们拒绝了  于是他便越级上报
They refused, so he went over their heads

643
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,190
直接找了托马斯和玛莎・韦恩
to Thomas and Martha Wayne.

644
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,700
他说服了他们中止项目
He convinced them to shut it down.

645
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,770
他们死后
And when they died,

646
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,940
韦赞立刻重启了项目
WellZyn immediately revived the program

647
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,640
这次韦恩集团不再干涉
with the blessings of Wayne Enterprises.

648
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,370
最终  斯坦别无选择
In the end, there was nothing for Stan to do

649
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,400
只能采取激进的手段
but to resort to more radical measures.

650
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,610
杀人
Killing people.

651
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,650
你对此似乎并不感到愤怒  教授
I'm not hearing a sense of moral outrage, Professor.

652
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,240
如果你不介意
If you don't mind,

653
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,440
我的愤怒要留给
I'll reserve my moral outrage

654
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,410
这件事中真正的恶人
for the true villains of this piece.

655
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,740
你是指韦赞制药
You mean WellZyn.

656
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,060
是你跟波托斯基合谋
You planned this with Potolsky.

657
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,120
-是的  -他在哪
- Yes. - Where is he?

658
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,280
赶快说
Talk fast, bub!

659
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,140
你能把我怎么样  我一把老骨头  行将就木了
Oh, what are you gonna do to me? I'm an old man! I'm dying.

660
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,240
我希望你早日就木  你个恐怖分子
I'll help you die quicker, you terrorist.

661
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,790
很快  斯通将发表一则声明
Soon, Stan will issue a statement

662
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,820
而世界将无法无视他
the world won't be able to ignore.

663
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,810
很快
Soon?

664
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,490
-今天吗  -你们已经太迟了
- Today? - You're already too late.

665
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,010
-你跟我说他...  -等等
- Now, you tell us where he is right now... - Wait a minute!

666
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,160
等等  你说你要赴约
Wait a minute! You said you had an appointment, right?

667
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,320
你要去哪
Where were you going?

668
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,330
棒极了
Bravo!

669
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,620
你问对问题了
You've asked the right question.

670
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,840
迈出了启蒙的第一步
The first step to enlightenment.

671
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:15,280
他在哪
Where is he?!

672
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,410
-波托斯基在哪  -那些伪君子
- Where's Potolsky?! - Those hypocrites.

673
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,460
空洞的利他主义无法抹去他们的罪行
Empty altruism will not erase what they've done.

674
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,290
他们必须付出代价
They must pay.

675
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,460
谁  谁要付出代价
Who? Who must pay?

676
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,750
韦赞制药
WellZyn.

677
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,900
韦恩集团
Wayne Enterprises.

678
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,980
大家终将
Everyone will finally

679
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,230
-看清他们的真面目  -怎么看清
- see them for what they are. - How?

680
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,760
波托斯基去哪了
Where's Potolsky headed?

681
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,470
什么是利他主义
What's altruism?!

682
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,900
慈善
Charity.

683
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,120
我知道他去哪了
I know where he's going.

684
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,150
请问您姓名
Name, please?

685
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,210
这是布鲁斯・韦恩
He's, uh, Bruce Wayne.

686
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,200
这是布鲁斯・韦恩
He's Bruce Wayne.

687
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,930
-这边请  谢谢  -谢谢
- Just this way. Thank you. - Thank you.

688
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,730
韦恩集团
Wayne Enterprises is

689
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,520
是援助之手
a helping hand...

690
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,520
那是玛希斯女士
Oh, that's Miss Mathis.

691
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,070
她跟你父亲有密切合作
She worked closely with your father.

692
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,430
请坐吧  布鲁斯
Please, sit, Bruce.

693
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,380
能见到你出来活动真是太好了
It is so good to see you out and about.

694
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,440
能来我很高兴
Glad to be here.

695
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:16,260
我们韦恩集团的全体员工都十分替你难过
All of us at Wayne Enterprises are so sorry for your loss.

696
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,930
你们都是董事会成员吗
So, are all you here on the board?

697
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,010
不是的
Oh, heavens no.

698
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:23,690
我们只是中层管理人员
We're middle management.

699
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,360
董事会不会来参加这种活动
The board members don't do this sort of thing.

700
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,460
是吗
No?

701
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,470
为什么
Why not?

702
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:34,440
因为他们很忙啊  布鲁斯
Well, they're very busy people, Bruce.

703
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,290
你的家族建立了一个
Your family created a company

704
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,780
价值亿万的公司
worth billions and billions of dollars.

705
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,500
多厉害啊
How awesome is that?

706
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,420
真厉害
Awesome.

707
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,860
我想跟董事会谈谈  因为
I wanted to speak to them because I've found

708
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,910
我在阿卡姆项目中似乎发现了违法行为
what looks like serious irregularities in the Arkham project.

709
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,890
违法行为
Irregularities?

710
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,710
我向你保证  布鲁斯  韦恩集团
I can assure you, Bruce, that Wayne Enterprises

711
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,610
绝不会与罪犯合作
would never countenance doing business with criminals.

712
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,300
-这是不可能的  -希望如此
- Just wouldn't happen. - I hope so,

713
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,920
但我想亲自跟董事会谈谈
but I'd like to speak directly with the board myself.

714
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,060
你能帮我安排吗
Can you make that happen?

715
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,090
我当然会试试
I can certainly try.

716
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,320
发送

717
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,010
他们更喜欢通过法律调解手段
They prefer to communicate with minors

718
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,480
跟未成年人打交道...
via the usual legal mediation, but...

719
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,770
晚上好  女士们先生们
Good evening, ladies and gentleman.

720
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,000
这是代表所有生灵的一则公益宣言
This is a public service announcement on behalf of all living creatures.

721
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,190
你们听说过一种叫毒蛇的药物吗
You've heard of a drug called Viper?

722
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,020
那是我做的
That's me.

723
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,980
是我为韦赞制药做的
I made it for WellZyn,

724
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,980
韦恩集团的一家子公司
a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.

725
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,060
是真的吗
Is this true?

726
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,500
当然不是  布鲁斯
Of course not, Bruce.

727
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,030
这人显然是疯了
I mean, this man is clearly insane.

728
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,710
空调机在哪  屋顶吗
The AC plant-- where is it? On the roof?

729
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,170
正前方  舞厅那边的楼梯
Straight ahead, staircase across the ballroom.

730
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,120
清空舞厅
Clear the ballroom!

731
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,590
我本希望用街头游民做演示就足矣
I hoped that a demonstration using street people would suffice,

732
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,540
但看来只有重要人士
but seems bad things only truly happen

733
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,000
遭遇不幸才能引起关注
when they happen to important people.

734
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,470
比如你们
Like you!

735
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,540
哥谭市警局  大家都出去
GCPD! Everybody out!

736
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,410
快走
Now!

737
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,370
关掉
Turn it off!

738
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,350
不行
Can't do that.

739
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,680
关掉  否则我开枪了
Turn it off or I'll shoot!

740
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,790
开枪吧
Go ahead.

741
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,760
我的工作完成了
My work is done.

742
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,790
转过身  把手放在头后
Turn around! Put your hands behind your head!

743
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,450
十指交叉
Interlock your fingers!

744
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,890
没事的
That's all right.

745
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,530
你生气又困惑
You're angry and confused.

746
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,070
这我理解
I understand.

747
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,740
再不需要动用暴力了
There's no more need for violence.

748
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,470
别开枪
Don't shoot!

749
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,150
多谢你了
That's considerate of you.

750
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,010
我要走了
I'm leaving now.

751
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,050
去39号仓库看看
Go look in warehouse 39.

752
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,450
你哪都别想去
You're not going anywhere!

753
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,570
我去哪都行
I can go anywhere I want!

754
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,760
别
Don't do it!

755
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,320
看来好东西也会嫌多
You really can have too much of a good thing.

756
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,930
空的
Nothing.

757
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,350
你以为呢
What'd you expect?

758
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,880
这儿可是哥谭
It's Gotham.

759
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,420
我是玛希斯
It's Mathis.

760
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
我在大楼外  他们来了
I'm outside the site. They're here.

761
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,160
不  还是别动他们
No. I think we should leave them be.

762
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,760
他们在这儿什么都找不到
There's nothing here for them.

763
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,210
如果他们查到什么  我们再做考虑
We'll review that if they get close.

764
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,820
韦赞制药  备忘录

765
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,740
都10分钟了
It's been ten minutes.

766
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,860
我保证  我的朋友很可靠
I-I assure you, my friend is reliable.

767
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,300
你怕吗  企鹅
You scared, Penguin?

768
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,130
你的声音又发抖了
Your voice is doing that shaky thing.

769
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,120
没有  先生
No, sir.

770
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,590
我很好
I'm fine.

771
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,240
你不用强撑的
You don't have to act tough.

772
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,000
紧张是好事
Nerves are a good thing.

773
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,360
或许我是有点紧张  先生
Perhaps I am a bit jittery, sir.

774
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,210
很好
Good.

775
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,940
你该紧张
You should be.

776
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,360
如果我的手下出不来  你也别想活
'Cause if my boys don't make it, neither do you.

777
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,770
吃瘪吧  法尔科内  你个孙子
Take that, Falcone, you son of a bitch!

778
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,560
我说了  弗兰基
Huh? I told you, Frankie,

779
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,710
这小子有两下
the kid's a player.

780
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,120
他有前途
He's got a future.

781
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,020
你像个老太太似的磨蹭什么呢  走啊
What are you waiting here like an old lady? Go!

782
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,080
给我解开
Untie me.

783
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,050
说"求你"
Say "pretty please."

784
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:38,070
求你
Please.

785
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,210
有时候我觉得你不喜欢我
Sometimes I think you really don't like me.

786
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,950
如果我不喜欢你  怎么会支持你接手
Now, would I be backing your takeover if I didn't like you?

787
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,970
在法尔科内面前嘛
And that stuff with Falcone--

788
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,870
总得装装样子给那老头看
well, we have to look good for the old man.

789
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,450
如果他发现我们在合作
If he figures we're working together,

790
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,690
我们就死定了
we'd be cooked.

791
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,460
耐心点
Patience.

792
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,580
我耐心快没了
I have no more patience.

793
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,540
那老头必须死
The old man has to go.

794
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,380
我们得尽快出手
We must strike soon.

795
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,220
是啊
Yes. Mm.

796
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,220
但要温柔一击
But softly.

797
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,060
打扰
Excuse me.

798
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,680
我听到了你哼的那首咏叹调
I couldn't help but overhear that aria you were humming.

799
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,500
是啊  我最喜欢那首了
Oh, yes. It's my favorite.

800
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,540
我也是
Mine, too.

801
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,240
那好啊
Ah, well, there you go.

802
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,110
抱歉
I'm sorry, I-I just...

803
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,180
我没想打扰你的
I-I didn't mean to bother you.

804
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,540
我年轻时  我妈妈总给我唱这首曲子
My mother sang that to me when I was young.

805
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:27,210
她这辈子  一直给我唱这首歌
Her whole life, she sang that to me.

806
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,520
我好久没听过了
I hadn't heard it in a while, and I...

807
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,160
都忍不住笑出来  你看上去...
I had to smile because you look...

808
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,840
抱歉  我在瞎唠叨呢
Anyhow, sorry, I'm rambling on.

809
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,790
没事的
No, that's okay.

810
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:41,850
你想听听吗
Do you want to listen?

811
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,310
是啊  好啊  谢谢
Well, yeah. S-Sure, thank you.

812
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,310
我们坐下吧
Let's sit down.

813
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:41,299
