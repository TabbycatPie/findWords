ranked taco in Chicago, so...

180
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,281
- Wrong place, wrong time.

181
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,153
- Check this out.
We looked at the pattern

182
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,589
of the previous robberies.

183
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,199
The crew knew when these places
would be fat

184
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,158
and how to slip away
without being detected.

185
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,116
They case these joints,
probably ate there.

186
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,814
Makes sense they're
from the neighborhood.

187
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:47,989
- If they're worried about
her being a witness

188
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,207
why not just silence her there?

189
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:50,513
- She's a white girl.

190
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:51,906
Maybe they thought
she was worth something.

191
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:53,429
- Or they grabbed her
for other reasons.

192
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,909
- When we find this crew,
we find her,

193
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:57,041
so search databases
for anyone convicted

194
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:58,695
of robberies living around
Little Village.

195
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,697
Now let's get some extra
patrol units in here,

196
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:03,134

with an open warrant.

197

two separate directions.

207
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,596

Okay, there are a lot of
undocumented immigrants

209

scared of being deported.

210

you want to find your daughter,

211
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,342
so do I.
But it's my job

Yeah.
Right, give it to me.

probably a different woman.

Thanks for your help.

216

to collect the reward.

218

or are you chasing the money?

219
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:55,578
But do you have any more
information?

220
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:56,971
- What, are we a bunch
of telemarketers?

221
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,320
- Hank, the phones
just started blowing up.

222
00:08:58,363 --> 00:08:59,669
People are calling us directly.

223
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,018
- 500 grand's got
a way of making people

225
