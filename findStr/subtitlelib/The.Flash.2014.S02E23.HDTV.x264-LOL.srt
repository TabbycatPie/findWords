1
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:04,095
This season on The Flash...

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,862
- Who are you?
- My name is Jay Garrick.

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:08,064
Where I came from, I was
a speedster like you.

4
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,334
Before I arrived on your
Earth, I was in a fight

5
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,501
with a man named Zoom.

6
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,002
He will do whatever it takes

7
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:15,071
to ensure he's the only speedster

8
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,072
in any world.

9
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,107
Never forget:

10
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,809
I am the fastest man alive.

11
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,546
I get these feelings
sometimes, these vibes.

12
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:25,449
- Cisco, what did you see?
- I saw Jay. He's Zoom.

13
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,950
Who's the man in the iron mask?

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,585
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

15
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,053
What do you say

16
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,421
you and I give this a shot?

17
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,756
Yeah, I would like that.

18
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,324
I've always measured my success

19
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,260
by counting the number
of victims I've had.

20
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,728
But now I think I'm
going to start counting

21
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,763
the number of Earths I conquer instead.

22
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,431
Earth-2 is splitting in half.

23
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,033
Tell me I did not just see
the end of the world.

24
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,703
- Dad? No. No!
- This is what's gonna make you

25
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,472
just like me.

26
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,415
Jay? No!

27
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:56,388
No!

28
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,050
Dad?

29
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,152
Dad? Hey! Hey!

30
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:03,052
Hey, look at me.

31
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,187
Look at me. Dad.

32
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,155
Don't leave. Not again.

33
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,490
Not again. Dad!

34
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,824
Come on. Come on. Come on.

35
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,626
It's all right. No.

36
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:10,802
Dad.

37
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,316
No, Dad.

38
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,292
I told you family was a weakness.

39
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,590
You feel the anger, don't you, Flash?

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,393
And now...

41
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,370
the two of us are the same.

42
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,933
No! No!

43
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,368
There you go, Flash!

44
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:52,803
Use your anger,

45
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,714
just like I did.

46
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,083
I got you, Zolomon!

47
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,084
Go on, Barry.

48
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,285
Embrace your anger.

49
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,895
End me!

50
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,405
Let me do it for you.

51
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,778
So close, Barry.

52
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,673
Another time remnant.

53
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,741
You see, Barry,

54
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,209
there could be two of you.

55
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:09,120
You just have to be
willing to kill yourself.

56
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,549
Yeah.

57
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,459
You're almost ready.

58
00:03:26,551 --> 00:03:29,844
And comfort us today

59
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:31,713
with the word of your promise

60
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,515
- HUSBAND & FATHER - HENRY ALLEN
- as we return our brother to the earth,

61
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:36,484
- BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER - NORA ALLEN
- and leave us with the hope

62
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:39,729
that, one day, we'll meet again.

63
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,480
My father's...

64
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:07,023
I can't do this right now.

65
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:10,593
It's okay, Barry.

66
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:14,655
Henry Allen.

67
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:18,059
Henry suffered two great
losses in his life.

68
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:22,897
He lost his wife, Nora,
and he lost Barry.

69
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:24,766
He suffered guilt,

70
00:04:24,776 --> 00:04:26,735
embarrassment,

71
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:29,204
ridicule, shame, and
everything that comes

72
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:33,396
with being blamed for a
crime he didn't commit.

73
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:37,511
Henry Allen was proof
that love can get you

74
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:39,580
through the darkest of days,

75
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,226
and that love will keep him
alive in all of our hearts.

76
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:01,077
I'm gonna find him, Dad.

77
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:07,449
I promise you I'm gonna take
from him what he took from you.

78
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:31,174
Hey.

79
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:33,907
Hey.

80
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,137
I thought maybe you
should eat something.

81
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,906
I'm not hungry. Thank you, though.

82
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:38,981
Yeah.

83
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,779
Barry...

84
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,582
I had no idea that you were The Flash.

85
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,551
What you did for me,

86
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,620
all the things that
you've done for everyone,

87
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,222
this whole city...

88
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:57,599
And now this with your dad and Zoom.

89
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:02,297
I'm so sorry.

90
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:03,965
Thanks, Wally.

91
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,733
If there's anything you need,

92
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:08,102
you just say the word.

93
00:06:08,112 --> 00:06:09,979
All right.

94
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:13,107
Guys,

95
00:06:13,117 --> 00:06:15,476
Zoom's still out there.

96
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:17,378
We need to come up with a plan.

97
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,613
The man can crack open
breaches to Earth-2.

98
00:06:19,623 --> 00:06:21,216
I mean, if he can do that,

99
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:22,884
what else can he do that
we don't know about?

100
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,987
Right after he killed his time remnant,

101
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:27,922
he told me I was "almost ready."

102
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:29,357
Almost ready for what?

103
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,391
I don't know.

104
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:32,160
Yep. Classic psychopath.

105
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,528
Why can't they ever just
say what they want to do?

106
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:36,898
We also have to figure out
why I keep vibing Earth-2

107
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:39,533
- being ripped to shreds.
- Seriously.

108
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:42,270
It's like I'm watching
"Transformers" in 4-D,

109
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,406
but, like, ten times more realistic

110
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,242
and with much better acting.

111
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:49,978
Look, if you can vibe the future,

112
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:52,747
we need to stop Zoom
before that happens.

113
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,623
I'm gonna get some air, all right?

114
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,996
I got it.

115
00:07:18,383 --> 00:07:21,675
When I was in the Speed Force,

116
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,711
I felt like...

117
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:27,382
I'd finally come to
grips with her death,

118
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:31,819
with not saving her when I went back.

119
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:35,056
And then the moment...

120
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:40,461
where I'm finally at the
place I can move on,

121
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:42,604
my father's taken from me.

122
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:48,403
How am I ever supposed
to find peace with that?

123
00:07:48,413 --> 00:07:50,004
I don't know, Barry,

124
00:07:50,014 --> 00:07:52,073
but you're gonna have to
find a way to do that,

125
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:54,050
or it's gonna tear you apart.

126
00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:00,889
I just miss him so much already.

127
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:10,992
Zoom.

128
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:12,668
Barry, no!

129
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:16,939
Bad time, Flash?

130
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,235
Thought I'd give you some time to mourn.

131
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:23,004
This ends now.

132
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:24,405
Not yet.

133
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:26,907
There's always more to take, Barry.

134
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:28,742
You're gonna stay away from them.

135
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:30,311
Well, that's completely up to you.

136
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:32,513
- What?
- When we first met,

137
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:35,183
I told you that Zoom
needed to be the best.

138
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:39,354
You just didn't realize I
was talking about myself.

139
00:08:39,364 --> 00:08:41,222
Is that what this is about?

140
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:43,524
A race, Barry,

141
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:45,426
between you and me...

142
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:47,561
to see who's the fastest.

143
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,796
this is over,

144
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,098
and you get to be the hero.

145
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,732
I'm not racing you.

146
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:54,268
Then your father won't be
the only person you love

147
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:56,237
that I'll take from you.

148
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:58,106
Think about it, Flash.

149
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:01,275
All I want to know is who's
the fastest man alive

150
00:09:01,285 --> 00:09:04,245
on either world.

151
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,254
I'll be waiting.

152
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,140
So Zoom wants to race you?

153
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,675
He's obsessed with being the best.

154
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,143
Why would we trust him?

155
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:19,811
He just wants to race.

156
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,612
You know, it actually makes sense

157
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:24,182
in a completely-off-your-rocker
sort of way.

158
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:26,117
That can't be everything he wants.

159
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:27,152
It isn't.

160
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:28,687
This Magnetar

161
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:31,422
that's being developed
by Mercury Labs...

162
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:33,199
turns out, it can act as a pulsar.

163
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:37,095
What is a pulsar?

164
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,130
It's a power amplifier
with a highly magnetized,

165
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,332
dense rotating core

166
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:43,802
that can be easily weaponized.

167
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:47,238
Nah, that's not dangerous at all.

168
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:49,040
That's what happens to Earth-2.

169
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,409
What happens in my vibes is
because of this machine.

170
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,812
That thing is powerful
enough to destroy a planet?

171
00:09:53,822 --> 00:09:54,979
A lot more than just a planet,

172
00:09:54,989 --> 00:09:56,681
if it has the right power source.

173
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:57,982
Like what?

174
00:09:57,992 --> 00:09:59,617
Like me.

175
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,152
That's why he wants to race.

176
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:04,622
He wants to siphon the
energy I create when I run.

177
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:06,557
He wants to siphon the
energy off both of you.

178
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,026
When Jay captured me,

179
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:09,961
he said that he used
to measure his success

180
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:12,163
by counting the number
of victims he had,

181
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,798
but now he was gonna measure it

182
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:16,667
by counting the number of
Earths he conquered instead.

183
00:10:16,677 --> 00:10:19,370
He doesn't want to just destroy Earth-2;

184
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,840
he wants to take out every other
planet in the multiverse.

185
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,874
How many are there?

186
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:24,342
Infinite.

187
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:26,377
Yeah, well, he can do that?

188
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:28,913
If he can create a breach to
Earth-2 all on his own...

189
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:30,181
He can get to all of 'em.

190
00:10:30,191 --> 00:10:33,417
One pulse to destroy them all.

191
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:35,061
I guess I don't have a choice.

192
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:37,930
I have to race him.

193
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:41,333
And I have to win.

194
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:50,068
Bare.

195
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:52,637
Don't race him.

196
00:10:52,647 --> 00:10:53,671
It's not that easy.

197
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:55,240
Yes, it is. You just say no.

198
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,607
We find another way to stop him,

199
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,042
together, like we always do.

200
00:10:58,052 --> 00:10:59,944
And do what, Joe?

201
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:02,781
Just sit around and wait for
him to kill somebody else?

202
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:06,050
Wally? Iris? You?

203
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,518
No. No way.

204
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:10,789
He needs you, Bare. He needs you
speed again to get what he wants.

205
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,792
We have the advantage here.

206
00:11:13,802 --> 00:11:16,094
All I have to do is beat him, Joe.

207
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:18,997
That saves the multiverse,
this whole city,

208
00:11:19,007 --> 00:11:21,232
all of you.

209
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:24,751
I won't let another person I
love die when I can prevent it.

210
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,605
This...

211
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,817
isn't just about racing Zoom, is it?

212
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:34,412
You want to kill this guy.

213
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:36,681
Of course I want to kill him, Joe!

214
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:38,649
I want to do a hell of a lot
more than just kill him!

215
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:41,585
I want him to suffer for
everything that he's done!

216
00:11:41,595 --> 00:11:42,520
And he's going to.

217
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,088
Come on, Bare.

218
00:11:44,098 --> 00:11:46,657
Think about what you're saying.

219
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:50,228
I have to be willing to
do whatever it takes.

220
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:52,396
I'm sorry, but I'm racing him,
whether you want me to or not.

221
00:11:52,406 --> 00:11:55,934
And I can't talk you out of it?

222
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:57,168
Not this time.

223
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:59,245
Then I'm sorry too.

224
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:19,732
Wha...?

225
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:26,339
What are you doing?

226
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,472
Why did you put me in here?

227
00:12:34,482 --> 00:12:36,507
Because you're too angry right now.

228
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:38,542
You can't race him like that.

229
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,912
Without a plan, you're... you'll lose.

230
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:44,782
Keeping me in here is gonna
get everyone killed.

231
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,318
I'm the only one that can
stop him; you know that.

232
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:50,889
You race Zoom on his terms,

233
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:52,123
you'll lose.

234
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:54,225
This is not your decision to make!

235
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,895
- It is this time.
- No.

236
00:12:56,905 --> 00:12:59,697
We all made it together.

237
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:02,533
What?

238
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:03,534
All of you?

239
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:05,270
Bro, I went back and forth.

240
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,338
I was, like, a good 60/40 at first.

241
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:09,073
Ramon.

242
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,742
Yeah, yeah, we all made the decision.

243
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,544
Come on.

244
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,546
Allen.

245
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:17,048
Allen.

246
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:19,550
This is for your own good.

247
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,785
Don't do this.

248
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:22,653
Guys, come on. Iris?

249
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:24,522
Cisco, come on, man.

250
00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:25,523
You have to let me...!

251
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,925
you have to let me stop him!

252
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:28,600
You have to let me...!

253
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:35,666
Did we make the right call here?

254
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:37,209
Yeah, we did.

255
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:46,821
You okay, Joe?

256
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:49,257
Yeah, that was just a little
harder than I anticipated.

257
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,267
Yeah, locking up Barry...

258
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:53,795
That was the easy part.

259
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:58,266
Now, using our plan to take
down Zoom without Barry,

260
00:13:58,276 --> 00:13:59,634
that's gonna be the hard part,

261
00:13:59,644 --> 00:14:02,170
but it's gonna be a lot easier
once we know where he is, Ramon.

262
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,205
Chill, man. I'm working on it.

263
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:05,015
Work harder.

264
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:05,593
SIGNATURE DETECTED

265
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:06,808
- Got it.
- TRACE COMPLETED

266
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:08,309
He's at the industrial park on Leawood.

267
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,552
- Give me that.
- Yep.

268
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:12,847
That is some serious
nerd love right there.

269
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,583
Snow.

270
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:17,586
Look, everybody here would understand

271
00:14:17,596 --> 00:14:20,288
if you don't want to
go through with this.

272
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:21,723
Jay may be a monster,

273
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,524
but there's a human
inside of him somewhere.

274
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,359
I've gotten to that part of him before.

275
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:26,661
I know I can do it again.

276
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:28,496
I want to stop him, Harry,

277
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:31,265
for good.

278
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:33,201
Ramon.

279
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:35,904
So let's go over the plan again.

280
00:14:35,914 --> 00:14:38,172
Okay, Caitlin will distract Jay

281
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,308
so that you and Harry can
hit him with the boot.

282
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:41,610
Cisco's gonna open the breach,

283
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,411
and we're gonna put him through it.

284
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:44,646
I'll disarm the Magnetar.

285
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,481
Destroy the Magnetar...

286
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:48,216
Save the multiverse.

287
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:50,085
One more thing. We need to agree.

288
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:51,920
We all made this decision together,

289
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,190
so if anything goes
wrong, we stick with it.

290
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,001
Let's load up.

291
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:12,807
Hey.

292
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,209
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

293
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:16,611
You know, I've just been thinking.

294
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:18,579
You know, what's... what's next?

295
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:19,514
What's next?

296
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:22,150
We stop Zoom.

297
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,217
Right.

298
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:24,519
Right, I guess...

299
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,354
I don't know, I mean... after that.

300
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:28,890
I don't know. Haven't really
given it much thought.

301
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,925
Yeah, no... no, I know you haven't.

302
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:33,662
Guess I've just... I've been
thinking about it a lot lately.

303
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:36,330
You know, I see the way you
are with everyone here...

304
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,366
Caitlin and Cisco,

305
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:40,035
Iris and Joe,

306
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:42,203
Barry,

307
00:15:42,213 --> 00:15:43,437
especially Barry.

308
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:46,240
You care about these people a lot.

309
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,477
You know, but... but my friends?

310
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:50,879
They're all back home

311
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:52,747
on our Earth.

312
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,415
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

313
00:15:54,425 --> 00:15:57,886
you know, when this is all over,

314
00:15:57,896 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm gonna go back home

315
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,388
to live my life.

316
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:01,690
But if you need to stay here

317
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,060
so that you can live
yours again, I get that.

318
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,094
I understand. It's okay, because...

319
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:07,729
- I...
- No, Dad.

320
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:11,399
Seeing you happy,

321
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:14,510
that is all I've ever wanted for you.

322
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:31,986
Okay. In position.

323
00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:33,855
Copy that. We got you.

324
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:36,791
Okay. Snow, you ready?

325
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:38,267
As ready as I can be.

326
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,664
Cisco.

327
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:46,267
Cisco, you good?

328
00:16:46,277 --> 00:16:47,635
Define "good."

329
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:50,972
Ramon. You're gonna be great.

330
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:52,406
Snow.

331
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,742
When you're ready.

332
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:56,144
Okay.

333
00:16:56,154 --> 00:16:58,613
You got this.

334
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,790
Here we go.

335
00:17:04,963 --> 00:17:07,421
Jay?

336
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:08,631
Caitlin.

337
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:12,468
Jay!

338
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:19,868
How did you find me?

339
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:22,771
Doctor McGee said the Magnetar
was stolen from her labs.

340
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:24,572
I knew that it had to be you,

341
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:26,983
so I tracked you here.

342
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,778
I tracked you here, Jay.

343
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:33,148
No one else knows.

344
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:36,151
I told you, if you left me...

345
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:37,451
That if I betrayed you,

346
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:39,520
you'd show me no mercy, I know.

347
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,023
But I just want to
explain why I did that.

348
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:44,826
Please, Jay.

349
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:45,927
Talk.

350
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:47,295
Good job, girl.

351
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:49,497
Now draw him towards you.

352
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:51,532
I made a mistake.

353
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:55,170
I am so sorry that I abandoned you.

354
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,470
But you have to understand,

355
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,439
what you said to me...

356
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:01,176
that there was a dark side of me...

357
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:04,545
that I was more like Killer
Frost than I knew...

358
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:06,948
I didn't want to accept that.

359
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,584
I tried to lock the
darkness inside of me.

360
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:15,290
But you knew that that was
already a part of me now.

361
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,059
And you're the only one who did.

362
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:23,531
And now, I'm ready to
accept who I really am.

363
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,808
Cisco, get ready.

364
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:30,104
I am so sorry that I hurt you.

365
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:34,742
But now I want to be the
one that only you know.

366
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:36,510
Please, Jay.

367
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,120
Let me try.

368
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:46,855
One more step.

369
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:50,566
I knew you'd eventually
come around, Caitlin.

370
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:55,437
But it's too late.

371
00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:01,911
Now, Ramon!

372
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:08,042
Damn it.

373
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,043
Tranq him!

374
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:10,311
Tranq him!

375
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,453
Gun is jammed!

376
00:19:11,796 --> 00:19:12,922
Is working.

377
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:28,271
Dad!

378
00:19:46,046 --> 00:19:47,537
Did you see my dad?

379
00:19:47,547 --> 00:19:49,306
No, the vibe keeps changing.

380
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:51,474
It's like my brain is channel
surfing or something.

381
00:19:51,484 --> 00:19:52,809
They must be on the move.

382
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:54,044
That's why the vibe's in flux.

383
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:56,412
Keep trying.

384
00:19:56,422 --> 00:19:57,848
Hey, did you turn off the Magnetar?

385
00:19:57,858 --> 00:19:59,249
No, there's no messing with that thing.

386
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:00,817
Whatever he did to it...
we try and touch it,

387
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:04,721
we try and move it...
this planet's done for.

388
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:07,365
Iris.

389
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:10,235
What's wrong?

390
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,032
Zoom took Dad.

391
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,800
What? How?

392
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,078
We tried to stop Zoom by pushing
him through the breach, but...

393
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:23,073
he took Joe with him.

394
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,875
Well, where's Barry?
Did he go after him?

395
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:29,112
He's not with us. He's
in a cell in the intake.

396
00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:33,383
Wait, you... you tried
to stop Zoom alone?

397
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:34,692
Long story.

398
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:41,925
Well, we have to get him back.

399
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:44,995
Wally, before Zoom took
Dad, we all agreed

400
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:46,329
that if we got him off this Earth,

401
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:47,898
we would close the breaches for good,

402
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:52,402
and we would never open them again,

403
00:20:52,412 --> 00:20:55,939
under any circumstances.

404
00:20:55,949 --> 00:21:00,243
Why... why would you do that?

405
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:02,545
No. No way, that's not gonna happen.

406
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:03,980
He made us all agree to it.

407
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,615
Well, guess what. I
didn't agree to that.

408
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,716
Wally...

409
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:09,452
Iris, I already lost my mom.

410
00:21:09,462 --> 00:21:11,821
If Dad...

411
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:13,431
I...

412
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:31,607
I will say,

413
00:21:31,617 --> 00:21:35,812
if anything, Barry sure has an
ample number of fathers to kill.

414
00:21:35,822 --> 00:21:38,014
If you're gonna kill me,

415
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,482
kill me.

416
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,484
It doesn't matter.

417
00:21:41,494 --> 00:21:43,019
You're not racing anybody.

418
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:44,421
Come on, Joe.

419
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:46,589
You know Barry better than that.
You raised him.

420
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,791
He'll say yes if he
thinks he can save you.

421
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:50,226
Not this time.

422
00:21:50,236 --> 00:21:51,970
I made sure of it.

423
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,632
Who is that?

424
00:21:56,642 --> 00:21:58,335
It would just confuse you.

425
00:21:58,345 --> 00:21:59,810
Try me.

426
00:22:03,116 --> 00:22:05,342
I got my speed the same way Barry did.

427
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:07,543
When I got struck by the
dark matter and electricity,

428
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:10,447
I became Zoom, the fastest man alive.

429
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:13,350
Wasn't long before I had
this Earth on its knees.

430
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,650
But it wasn't enough.

431
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,120
I wanted more.

432
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,289
I wanted to be faster.

433
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:21,491
So I created a speed drug.

434
00:22:21,501 --> 00:22:23,093
Velocity-9.

435
00:22:23,103 --> 00:22:25,362
It made me faster than I
ever thought possible,

436
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:27,197
fast enough to break the
dimensional barrier,

437
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:30,333
fast enough to run to
other universes, other Earths.

438
00:22:30,343 --> 00:22:33,970
And then, one day, on one
of those other Earths,

439
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,505
I discovered him.

440
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:37,207
He's another speedster?

441
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:39,275
Yeah, you could say that.

442
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:42,479
That was right about the time I
discovered something else too.

443
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:46,849
All that V-9 I'd been injecting into
my system had a little side effect.

444
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:49,052
It was killing you.

445
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:50,987
I searched for a cure.

446
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:52,722
I tried everything.

447
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:54,524
I even tried to manipulate
the Speed Force,

448
00:22:54,534 --> 00:22:56,826
but let me tell you, the Speed Force,

449
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:58,828
the Speed Force does not
like its rules being broken.

450
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:02,765
Now it's been sending its
enforcers after me ever since.

451
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:07,003
So you brought him here
to steal his speed.

452
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:09,205
I tried, but it wouldn't take.

453
00:23:09,215 --> 00:23:11,274
But then the skies parted,

454
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:12,642
and I saw Barry,

455
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,810
and then I stole his speed.

456
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,079
I won.

457
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:18,981
I beat the rules of the Speed Force.

458
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:22,185
Why keep him here?

459
00:23:22,195 --> 00:23:24,454
Trophy.

460
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:27,190
And a little idea I had for fun.

461
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,461
You see, I got so tired
of being the villain,

462
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:34,597
so I decided to be the hero too.

463
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:37,633
I even borrowed his name,

464
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:41,946
Jay Garrick.

465
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,042
You know what's gonna
be great, Detective?

466
00:23:46,052 --> 00:23:47,877
After I beat Barry in the race

467
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:50,280
and prove that I'm the fastest
man alive on any Earth,

468
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:54,050
he's gonna rot in a cage
just like the one Jay's in now.

469
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,687
And then I'll have a
Flash from two worlds

470
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,630
to keep me company.

471
00:24:11,344 --> 00:24:13,169
Look.

472
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:16,033
Everyone's gonna freak when they
find out I did this, but I don't care.

473
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:18,216
We need your help, Barry.

474
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,473
SECURITY SYSTEM ALERT

475
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:26,182
Hey, guys,

476
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,650
Barry's not...

477
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,985
In his cell anymore.

478
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:29,617
Wally!

479
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:31,787
What? I wasn't just gonna
stand here and let this happen.

480
00:24:31,797 --> 00:24:33,156
You let him take Joe?

481
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,924
What the hell were you thinking?

482
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,526
Allen, there was nothing we could do.

483
00:24:36,536 --> 00:24:37,727
You could've let me race him!

484
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,996
Allen! You're not racing Zoom!

485
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:41,831
What are you gonna do? Are
you gonna tranq me again?

486
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,466
Don't tempt me.

487
00:24:43,476 --> 00:24:45,735
Look, I know you guys made a
pact to keep Zoom on Earth-2,

488
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:47,570
but you did that without me and Wally.

489
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,339
All right? You don't get to do that!

490
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:51,774
Barry, look at yourself
right now; you're not okay.

491
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:53,643
Cisco, my dad was just
killed in front of me!

492
00:24:53,653 --> 00:24:55,145
Do you have any idea how that feels?

493
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:56,679
Watching someone you love die?

494
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:57,980
Yes, I do.

495
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,149
Cait...

496
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:00,216
Look, Barry.

497
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:02,752
I... I know how cold and angry

498
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:04,720
and distant that can make you.

499
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,955
But when this happened to me,

500
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:08,291
you were the one who kept me in check.

501
00:25:08,301 --> 00:25:10,092
You told me to stop and take a breath,

502
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:12,295
and that's all we're
telling you to do now.

503
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:13,796
I'm telling you I'm good.

504
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:15,598
Really? You're good?

505
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:17,700
Because it seems to me you want
to do more than stop Zoom.

506
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,569
It seems to me you want revenge.

507
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:20,703
If that's why you're doing this,

508
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:23,347
Allen, you will lose.

509
00:25:25,318 --> 00:25:26,509
Look, you guys.

510
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,445
I... you may not think I can do this.

511
00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:31,281
You may think I'm too angry.

512
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:34,016
But we're running out of time!

513
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:35,385
I have to beat him,

514
00:25:35,395 --> 00:25:36,786
and I'm going to,

515
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,021
whether I have your help or not.

516
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:40,964
So which one is it?

517
00:25:42,768 --> 00:25:44,060
So how does this work?

518
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,529
It's the same way we took Iris
into the Speed Force.

519
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:48,164
Harry does his best Frankenstein,

520
00:25:48,174 --> 00:25:50,866
you hold my hand, and I vibe you there.

521
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:52,343
All right, let's do it.

522
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:04,013
I'll do it.

523
00:26:04,023 --> 00:26:06,182
Say when and where. I'll be there.

524
00:26:06,192 --> 00:26:09,319
Cisco's learned how to bring
people into his vibes.

525
00:26:09,329 --> 00:26:11,221
There's one condition.

526
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:12,322
You bring Joe back.

527
00:26:12,332 --> 00:26:15,157
But if he's harmed in any way,

528
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,158
it's off.

529
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:17,627
I'll bring him,

530
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:20,062
and I won't release him
until after we race.

531
00:26:20,072 --> 00:26:22,131
Deal?

532
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:24,742
Deal.

533
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,712
I tell you, Jay might be crazy-pants,

534
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:38,856
but he can pick a venue.

535
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:46,455
Brought the whole crew with you?

536
00:26:46,465 --> 00:26:47,990
Can't say I blame you.

537
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,491
- Dad.
- Wally!

538
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,460
It's gonna be one hell of a show.

539
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,195
Let him go.

540
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:55,197
After we race.

541
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:57,800
Cut the crap. We know you
plan to power up the Magnetar

542
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,335
so you can destroy the multiverse.

543
00:27:00,345 --> 00:27:03,272
Bravo. You figured it out...

544
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:04,874
almost.

545
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,642
I don't want to destroy all of it.

546
00:27:06,652 --> 00:27:09,078
This Earth is at the
center of the multiverse.

547
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:12,682
It's the access point to every
other Earth in existence.

548
00:27:12,692 --> 00:27:15,623
One trans-dimensional shockwave, and...

549
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:18,387
Leaving just our Earth.

550
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:20,556
How generous of you.

551
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:23,266
Need to have some place to hang my cowl.

552
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,804
You might want to say your good-byes.

553
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:36,639
Don't worry.

554
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:38,574
I'm gonna save your dad.

555
00:27:38,584 --> 00:27:39,642
No.

556
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:41,978
You're gonna save our dad.

557
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:43,913
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs. It's safer.

558
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,547
We're not going anywhere.

559
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:47,249
We got eyes and ears right here.

560
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:48,517
Either he goes,

561
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:50,127
or we all die together.

562
00:27:53,332 --> 00:27:54,832
We believe in you.

563
00:27:57,803 --> 00:28:00,362
Wait.

564
00:28:00,372 --> 00:28:02,598
Barry,

565
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:03,941
kick his ass.

566
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:11,941
What are the rules?

567
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:14,268
One lap around the inside of this loop

568
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:15,978
will produce about 1 gigawatt of energy,

569
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:20,449
and I need 500-plus to power the
Magnetar enough to do the job.

570
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:22,184
Once it's full, I win,

571
00:28:22,194 --> 00:28:24,620
because there is no stopping it.

572
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,155
So all I have to do to beat you

573
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:28,724
is stop you before that happens.

574
00:28:28,734 --> 00:28:31,060
Yep. It's that simple.

575
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,764
But if, at any point, you decide
you don't want to race anymore,

576
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:37,066
dear old dad number two is a dead man,

577
00:28:37,076 --> 00:28:40,069
as well as your little fan club.

578
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,204
They're not my fan club.

579
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:45,074
They're the reason that I'm running,

580
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:46,516
why I'm gonna beat you.

581
00:28:49,454 --> 00:28:52,389
Let's see what you're made of, Flash.

582
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:57,553
Just say when, Zoom.

583
00:28:57,563 --> 00:28:59,689
Run, Barry.

584
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:00,630
Run!

585
00:29:22,088 --> 00:29:23,921
He's powering up the Magnetar.

586
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,763
Come on, Barry. Catch up.

587
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,534
Which one's Barry?

588
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:47,244
Both of them.

589
00:29:47,526 --> 00:29:49,246
- He made a...
- Time remnant.

590
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,120
Go, all right? Go!

591
00:29:56,393 --> 00:29:58,088
I'll explain later, Joe.

592
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:03,526
A remnant?

593
00:30:04,013 --> 00:30:06,864
Stole my trick, Flash.

594
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,533
But you're too late.

595
00:30:12,938 --> 00:30:16,198
Bye-bye, multiverse.

596
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,474
No!

597
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:29,278
What's the time remnant doing?

598
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,046
He's creating his own pulse.

599
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:33,883
- Why would he do that?
- Because...

600
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:35,918
if that's out of phase,

601
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:37,719
it'll counteract that one.

602
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:39,930
Wait, his body can't handle that.

603
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:42,424
Then what's gonna happen?

604
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:44,434
He'll die.

605
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:21,430
You're a hero, Barry.

606
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,834
You couldn't kill me before.

607
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:27,410
You won't kill me now.

608
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,918
I don't have to.

609
00:32:04,206 --> 00:32:06,798
Okay, so you ran back in time

610
00:32:06,808 --> 00:32:09,568
and made a copy of yourself?

611
00:32:09,578 --> 00:32:12,604
Well... basically.

612
00:32:12,614 --> 00:32:13,771
Yeah.

613
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:15,974
It's called a time remnant.

614
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:19,777
It's not something that
I can do every day,

615
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:22,481
but I needed a way to
draw the Time Wraiths

616
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:25,183
out of the Speed Force,
hoping they'd be more upset

617
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,152
at what Zoom had done
than they'd be with me.

618
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,420
Is that what I look like

619
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,255
when they start talking about science?

620
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,456
Pretty much.

621
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:34,292
Don't worry, Wally. It'll
get easier to understand.

622
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:36,294
Well, how does that even work?

623
00:32:36,304 --> 00:32:37,895
Same way Zoom did it.

624
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:41,633
I ran back in time
moments before I left.

625
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:43,868
It's the only way I can
be in two places at once.

626
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:47,672
Okay, so the time
remnant, it's still you?

627
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:49,112
Yeah.

628
00:32:49,122 --> 00:32:50,922
But he died.

629
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,647
He was willing to sacrifice
himself for all of us.

630
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:57,949
That's how much he loved us.

631
00:32:57,959 --> 00:33:00,785
You know what? We'll just...
we'll forget about it.

632
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:02,687
Barry, I'm glad you're okay.

633
00:33:02,697 --> 00:33:03,821
You know what?

634
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:05,857
- In battle, choose your weapon wisely.
- Here.

635
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,125
- All right? Some people choose a gun.
- Oh, I don't know...

636
00:33:07,135 --> 00:33:09,027
I choose a Phillips-head screwdriver.

637
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:10,728
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. You're so particular.

638
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:11,963
Ramon, can you just please...

639
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,131
have you ever worked with a tool before?

640
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,132
I'm working with one now.

641
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:15,133
Are you ready?

642
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:16,301
One,

643
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:17,402
two,

644
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,378
and...

645
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:24,776
I don't know what's more annoying,

646
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:26,311
being in that thing

647
00:33:26,321 --> 00:33:27,987
or listening to you
two arguing about it.

648
00:33:44,306 --> 00:33:45,530
You're...

649
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,365
I'm Jam Garrick,

650
00:33:47,375 --> 00:33:50,210
the real Jay Garrick.

651
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:56,575
What?

652
00:33:56,585 --> 00:33:57,717
I'm sorry. I... I'm sorry.

653
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:11,289
Bare.

654
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,857
He looks just like him.

655
00:34:12,867 --> 00:34:14,392
He looks just like my dad, Joe.

656
00:34:14,402 --> 00:34:15,393
I can't believe this.

657
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:16,528
My dad told me.

658
00:34:16,538 --> 00:34:17,795
He told me this. He said

659
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,997
his mom's maiden name was Garrick.

660
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:21,499
I just never thought that that meant...

661
00:34:21,509 --> 00:34:23,134
- Hey, Barry, Barry.
- I never thought it meant...

662
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,902
Barry, he doesn't know that.

663
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:26,471
He doesn't know

664
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,640
that he's your dad's doppelganger, okay?

665
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,909
You want me to tell him
that you had to leave?

666
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:33,612
No. No.

667
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:34,912
You sure?

668
00:34:34,922 --> 00:34:35,980
Yeah.

669
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,915
I just need a minute.

670
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,191
I'll be all right.

671
00:34:45,032 --> 00:34:46,190
- That's smart.
- Because of...

672
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,759
- yeah, and there it is.
- Genius.

673
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:50,395
So the reason you
didn't have your powers

674
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:52,864
is because there was a
dampener in the mask.

675
00:34:52,874 --> 00:34:54,966
You see?

676
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:57,377
I don't want to see
this thing ever again.

677
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:02,774
So your powers are back.

678
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,943
I see Jay... excuse me... Hunter...

679
00:35:05,953 --> 00:35:07,712
stole your color scheme too.

680
00:35:07,722 --> 00:35:09,581
He took a lot of things that were mine,

681
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:10,882
except for that.

682
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:13,117
That's... that's all him.

683
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:15,253
He said it was his
father's from the war.

684
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:18,956
Ironically, on my... on our Earth...

685
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:20,892
this helmet stood for hope.

686
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:23,428
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

687
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:27,432
Well, maybe I can
continue that sentiment,

688
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:30,302
take something from him, for a change,

689
00:35:30,312 --> 00:35:33,379
make it my own.

690
00:35:36,951 --> 00:35:38,476
It suits you.

691
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:40,845
Thank you, all of you,

692
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:44,616
for saving me from Zoom,

693
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:48,252
especially you, Flash.

694
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:49,454
You're welcome,

695
00:35:49,464 --> 00:35:50,630
Flash.

696
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:56,894
Now all I have to do
is find my way home.

697
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,196
And where's that?

698
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:00,707
I think you would call it Earth-3.

699
00:36:02,113 --> 00:36:03,643
Well, I can get you to Earth-2.

700
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:06,490
My daughter and I can
help you with the rest.

701
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,826
We can?

702
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:11,329
Yes, we can.

703
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:13,339
We're going home.

704
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:19,879
Okay.

705
00:36:24,085 --> 00:36:26,177
Snow.

706
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:29,347
You're a tremendous scientist, but...

707
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:31,082
you're an even better person.

708
00:36:31,092 --> 00:36:33,184
Don't make me cry, Harry.

709
00:36:33,194 --> 00:36:35,160
I've done enough of that already.

710
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,656
Detective Joe West...

711
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,025
Harry.

712
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:42,868
You have great kids.
You take care of them.

713
00:36:43,292 --> 00:36:44,328
Same to you.

714
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:46,964
You take care of that beautiful girl.

715
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:50,301
Yes, sir.

716
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,177
Hey.

717
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:59,476
I'm a better man than I
was when I got here,

718
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:00,577
and that's 'cause of you.

719
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:03,281
I'm not the same either.

720
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:05,082
Hey, don't be surprised

721
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:06,951
if I project myself over to Earth-2

722
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,452
every once in a while, you know,

723
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:10,362
just to throw your stuff
across the office.

724
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:15,801
I'll miss you too, Cisco.

725
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:24,601
So I guess I can't text you
from another Earth?

726
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:26,904
I guess not.

727
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:28,314
That's too bad.

728
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:35,212
Thank you guys, seriously,

729
00:37:35,222 --> 00:37:36,588
for saving our home.

730
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:38,582
Ready?

731
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:40,326
Yeah.

732
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,845
Can't stop thinking about
my dad's doppelganger.

733
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:44,648
Seeing him, knowing that he's out there,

734
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:46,183
that should've made it easier.

735
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,818
It doesn't.

736
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:50,287
It just made me miss him even more.

737
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:53,657
I can't even imagine how
hard that must have been.

738
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,293
We just won.

739
00:38:56,303 --> 00:38:58,862
We just beat Zoom.

740
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:01,340
Why does it feel like I just lost?

741
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,337
Because you've lost a lot
in your life, Barry,

742
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:09,681
more than most.

743
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:12,584
But...

744
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:16,780
Maybe you and me

745
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,616
seeing where this thing goes,

746
00:39:19,626 --> 00:39:23,429
maybe that can give you
something for a change.

747
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,660
That's all I've ever
wanted to hear you say.

748
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,363
And I wish that I was in a place

749
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:35,232
where I could try that with you.

750
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:39,036
But I feel so hollowed
out inside right now.

751
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:43,374
I feel more broken than
I've ever felt in my life.

752
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:46,177
If I'm ever gonna be
worth anything to you,

753
00:39:46,187 --> 00:39:49,313
I need to fix what's wrong with me.

754
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:53,392
I need to find some... some peace.

755
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:59,690
Barry, listen to me.

756
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,460
You waited for me for years.

757
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,862
You let me get to a place
where this was possible.

758
00:40:05,872 --> 00:40:08,199
So I am telling you

759
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:12,035
I am gonna do the same thing for you.

760
00:40:12,045 --> 00:40:14,205
Wherever you need to go,

761
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:16,574
whatever you need to do,

762
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:19,042
do it.

763
00:40:19,052 --> 00:40:22,087
And when you get back, I'll be here.

764
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:24,948
Okay.

765
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:27,426
I love you, Barry.

766
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:45,269
I love you too.

767
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,312
And I always will.

768
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:08,099
That's why I'm so sorry.

769
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:12,103
But I have to do this.

770
00:41:26,953 --> 00:41:29,821
- Barry!
- Mom!

771
00:41:35,962 --> 00:41:37,588
Barry!

772
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:38,955
No!

773
00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:40,399
No.

774
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,802
You're not gonna kill her this time.

775
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:54,213
You're not gonna kill her ever again.

776
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:19,104
No.

777
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:21,473
I'm not gonna hurt you.

778
00:42:21,655 --> 00:42:23,227
I'm not gonna hurt you.

779
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:24,272
Okay?

780
00:42:24,282 --> 00:42:26,800
I'm not gonna hurt you.

781
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,003
You're safe.

782
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:35,309
You're safe now.
