16
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,420
My name is Barry Allen,

17
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,560
and I am the fastest man alive.

18
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,430
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

19
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,170
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

20
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,120
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

21
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,160
After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse,

22
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,250
I ran back in time

23
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,850
and created the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

24
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,600
I restored the timeline to how it was,

25
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,780
only to find things weren't as I left them.

26
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,920
I brought new threats to our world,

27
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,270
and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.

28
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,520
I am The Flash.

29
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,280
Previously on "The Flash"...

30
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,030
What is that?

31
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,510
Another epidermal husk,

32
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,200
a fully-intact human pelt.

33
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,420
Do we have any theories as to what's causing them?

34
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,790
- I am Alchemy. - Well, what do you want?

35
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,100
To help people achieve their true potential.

36
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,130
I know you want this more than anything,

37
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,240
but you have to face the fact that it might not happen.

38
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,270
There's a whole multiverse of Harrison Wells out there.

39
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,970
- Call me HR. - You're a fake.

40
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,730
Let me prove my worth.

41
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,470
If I fail, I will right back to my Earth.

42
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,120
If I succeed,

43
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,760
I will have done some good with my life.

44
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,710
Caitlin, these powers you have,

45
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,010
the more you use them,

46
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,480
the more difficult they're going to be to reverse.

47
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,600
I'm fast,

48
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,470
really fast.

49
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,180
I might even be the fastest man alive.

50
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,930
And when I'm running,

51
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,670
there's no greater feeling in the world.

52
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,480
I can move through the city like a guardian angel,

53
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,410
protecting people who need me.

54
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,400
You gotta slow down.

55
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,220
And watch where you're going, okay?

56
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,710
- Okay. - Okay.

57
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,790
Cool skateboard, though.

58
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,850
Thanks.

59
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,270
They even have a name for me.

60
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,170
They call me "Kid Flash."

61
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,540
Kid Flash?

62
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,940
Yeah, the name needs some work, but, Dad,

63
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,190
I'm telling you, it all just felt so real

64
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,380
like it was actually happening.

65
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,940
And how often are you getting these dreams?

66
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,240
Last couple nights.

67
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,310
Last couple?

68
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,180
Wally, this is exactly

69
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,170
what Frankie Kane said happened to her.

70
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,550
She had dreams, a lot of painful ones,

71
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,770
and then she started hearing Alchemy's voice in her head

72
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,390
until she became Magenta.

73
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,200
This is totally different, Dad.

74
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,360
No. No, it's not.

75
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,300
Yes, it is.

76
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,390
I'm a speedster in my dreams.

77
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,050
I'm not an evil split personality.

78
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,670
I'm helping people, not hurting them.

79
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,420
Dad, this could mean that

80
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,970
my powers are finally manifesting.

81
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,280
No, I think this means that you have a lot in common

82
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,540
right now with people who either ended up in prison or dead.

83
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,830
Except for the fact that I got hit by the dark matter

84
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,650
from the particle accelerator explosion,

85
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,030
just like Jesse.

86
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm going to class.

87
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,930
Hey, Julian, do you want me to get started

88
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,880
on the DNA analysis for you?

89
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,650
Why would I need you to do that?

90
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,390
I don't know, I just figured

91
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,360
we worked so well together last time.

92
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,120
What, that I'd want to do it again?

93
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,360
One shared case and one shared drink

94
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,480
does not make us mates, okay?

95
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,520
Miss Horton.

96
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,550
Mr. Allen.

97
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,200
- Mr. Albert. - Morning.

98
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,390
New one?

99
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,260
Yeah, number six.

100
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,210
Found it last night.

101
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,400
Well, this should come as a welcome surprise.

102
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,780
You've been reassigned to meta-human

103
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,480
crime scene investigation full-time.

104
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,250
Full-time?

105
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,460
We're pouring all the resources we can

106
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,220
into figuring out this husk problem,

107
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,520
especially considering the last one turned out to be

108
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,150
that evil speedster, The Rival.

109
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,370
Any questions, concerns,

110
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,090
you guys direct them to Judge Hankerson, yeah?

111
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,400
- All right. - Thank you.

112
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,670
Joe.

113
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,290
Cecile.

114
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,820
I didn't know you were gonna be over here.

115
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,550
Any excuse I have to run into you, I take it.

116
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,720
You know, I'm really looking forward to tomorrow night.

117
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,480
So am I.

118
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,490
- Yeah? - Yeah.

119
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,350
Okay, good, then I,

120
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,240
- I'll see you then. - All right.

121
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,440
Yo. Is that what I think it was?

122
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,570
You asked her to movie night with us?

123
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,700
That's awesome. When did you do that?

124
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,800
How'd you do it?

125
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,420
As much as I'd like to gossip with you

126
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,820
like a teenager right now,

127
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,200
there's something else we need to talk about.

128
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,330
What?

129
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,640
Wally.

130
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
He's been having dreams.

131
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,980
Dreams?

132
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,350
Saving people,

133
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,120
becoming a speedster.

134
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,820
He called himself Kid Flash.

135
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,330
Kid Flash, he-- he said that name, specifically?

136
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,600
He's in trouble, isn't he?

137
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,680
If Wally's having dreams of being Kid Flash,

138
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,200
then he's in trouble,

139
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,610
yeah, but don't worry, okay, we'll figure it out.

140
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,780
- I'll see you later. - All right.

143
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,610
We have a problem.

144
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,710
Yeah, we do. He's still here.

145
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,200
Cisco, comedy of the obvious.

146
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,830
I made a pact to justify my presence on your Earth

147
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,660
and I think I got something.

148
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,760
- We're all ears. - Okay.

149
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,040
I read every news report I can get my hands on.

150
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,130
And I have come to the conclusion

151
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,650
that this very operation

152
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,350
is a ticking time-bomb.

153
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,580
What do you mean?

154
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,550
You can't spend all your time working on--

155
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,410
working on whatever-- whatever this is.

156
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,280
This-- this is a very delicate

157
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,870
set of power-dampening cuffs.

158
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,520
We need them to stop the meta-humans.

159
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
My point exactly.

160
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,860
It's not gonna be long

161
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,680
before people start putting the pieces together

162
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,350
and figure out what you're doing here.

163
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,760
You're working with The Flash.

164
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,010
Okay, so what's your idea?

165
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,970
The perfect disguise.

166
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,730
We reopen this laboratory

167
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,470
{\an8}and I become the face of the new S.T.A.R. Labs

170
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,140
Museum.

171
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,780
There's only one problem with that.

172
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,370
It's your face.

173
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,880
You're kind of a known murderer around these parts.

174
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,070
You see, the evil Wells,

175
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,320
not to be confused with the dick-ish but not evil Wells,

176
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,900
he confessed to killing Barry's mother.

177
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,960
So basically, if you step foot outside this lab,

178
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,430
you'll be arrested.

179
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,900
What-- you're just telling me this now, you two rascals?

180
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,740
What about the cryptogram? What about the message?

181
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,140
Come to this Earth. Get a fresh start.

182
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,280
Well, what about your r¨¦sum¨¦

183
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,220
as a world-renowned genius scientist?

184
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,330
That's a good point. I guess we're even.

185
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,300
If a string is in a knot, patience will untie it.

186
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,750
Patience can do lots of things. Have you ever tried it?

187
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,850
My dear ma used to say that to me all the time

188
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,410
any time I had a problem.

189
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,790
Now I have a problem.

190
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,230
I guess I'm gonna use that adage to figure it out.

191
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,150
S.T.A.R. Labs Museum, think about it.

192
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,650
You think everyone on Earth-19 is missing crayons in the box,

193
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,210
or just him?

194
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,770
Paging Dr. Snow.

195
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,740
- You are out of it. - Sorry.

196
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,490
This have anything to do with your recent visit with Mom?

197
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,260
I just-- I haven't been sleeping well,

198
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,740
but I'm okay.

199
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,450
Coffee?

200
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,500
Perfect.

201
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,060
So I did have powers?

202
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,550
I was Kid Flash?

203
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,380
In Flashpoint, yes.

204
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,540
I knew that this was happening.

205
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,150
Why didn't you tell me before?

206
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,190
Because...

207
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,020
Because why?

208
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,840
All right, fine, Wally, it, look--

209
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,250
in that timeline,

210
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,430
you were fighting The Rival.

211
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,550
Edward Clariss?

212
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,150
Edward Clariss, yeah.

213
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,430
You couldn't stop him.

214
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,000
There was no S.T.A.R. Labs.

215
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,320
There was no team to help you.

216
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,730
It was just you and Iris.

217
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,350
The two of you were a brother-sister

218
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,840
superhero crime-fighting team.

219
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,850
Why didn't you tell us this before?

220
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,950
You didn't want to know about your Flashpoint lives.

221
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,530
But look, listen to me,

222
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,190
you got hurt, all right?

223
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,880
You got hurt bad.

224
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,360
So what?

225
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,660
That's that me, it's not this me.

226
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,510
And I want to be a speedster.

227
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,900
I-- I want to be a flash.

228
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,760
No, no, no, you don't.

229
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,890
Yes, I do.

230
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,210
You're not hearing what he's saying.

231
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,420
He's telling us it's not safe.

232
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,600
Who cares what Barry's saying?

233
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,850
How do we even know he's telling the truth?

234
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,630
Wally, come on, this isn't because of

235
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,750
the particle accelerator, it's because of Dr. Alchemy.

236
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,260
It's the same thing that happened to Frankie Kane.

237
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,670
- You don't know that. - Yes, we do.

238
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,110
And we need to try to keep it from happening.

239
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,220
Why don't we just say what this is really about?

240
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,070
You're okay with Barry having powers;

241
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,480
you're okay with Barry running into danger,

242
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,740
fighting all these metas.

243
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,480
He can screw up over and over again

244
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,780
You're okay with all of it because he's Barry.

245
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,880
But you won't give me the same amount of leeway

246
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,970
because at the end of the day,

247
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,260
you just don't trust me.

248
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,650
You know that's not true, Wally.

249
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,860
I don't need you fighting my dad's battles for him.

250
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,270
Say it, Joe.

251
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,690
You don't trust me, do you?

252
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,360
Wally...

253
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,350
That's what I thought.

254
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,120
No. No, you're not listening to me.

255
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,500
I said the shares are undervalued

256
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,360
so if the stock drops, you should buy more, not less.

257
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,730
No, that-that's not how it works.

258
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,560
Look, just look at its balance sheet.

259
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,110
If you sell now, you're going to lose a lot of money.

260
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,210
I understand that.

261
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,550
Of course it's your money.

262
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,230
Just hold onto it then.

263
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,290
You know what? If you're not gonna listen...

264
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,120
Petechiae around the eye, the crushed larynx.

265
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,820
This poor chap has got

266
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,860
fingerprints all round his neck.

267
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,220
He's clearly been strangled.

268
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,480
I heard multiple witnesses

269
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,540
said the man was attacked by a shadow.

270
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,340
So a meta from Neverland's made the trip

271
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,570
to Central City. Fabulous.

272
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,130
So far there's no forensic evidence

273
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,200
that there was an assailant.

274
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,860
No laceration marks. No fingernail marks.

275
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,900
No DNA evidence underneath the fingernails even?

276
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,440
Nothing yet, we'll have to wait and see.

277
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,630
There's always something.

278
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,290
Bag the body up and I'll meet you back at the lab.

279
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,600
Yeah. See ya.

280
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,340
Oh, and Julian, um,

281
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,830
I'm going to that movie in the park thing

282
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,520
with Joe and his--or my-Iris and some other friends.

283
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,680
If you felt like going, it starts at 8:00.

284
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,800
We're all a bunch of nerds, so

285
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,980
you'll fit right in.

286
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,380
Well, that's a very enticing offer, Allen,

287
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,770
but I'm actually seeing my girlfriend tonight, so.

288
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,870
Oh, you have a girlfriend? I didn't know that.

289
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,460
I'm sure there's lots about me that you don't know.

290
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,930
- Cheerio. - Yeah.

291
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,180
- Albert. - Detective.

292
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,160
Anything?

293
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,980
With the--uh, nothing yet, at least.

294
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,560
Have you seen Wally this morning?

295
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,770
No. Why?

296
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,690
He left the house in a huff.

297
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,200
He won't answer my calls.

298
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,620
Iris is out there looking for him right now.

299
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,050
Did you want me to run around the city?

300
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,570
Maybe if I can't get ahold of him.

301
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,220
What Wally said, it's partially true.

302
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,050
I didn't answer his question because

303
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,850
I--I don't trust him with these powers

304
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,430
the same way I trust you with them.

305
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,870
You got to talk to him about that.

306
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,430
You know, tell him why, especially now.

307
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,790
I will, I mean, just gotta find him first.

308
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,890
Look, I'll just keep calling him.

309
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:48,140
He's got to answer at some point, right?

310
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,080
Man, I feel bad, too.

311
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,580
It's your first date with Cecile

312
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,720
and you got to worry about this.

313
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,890
Don't worry about that.

314
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,940
That's one part of my life I can control.

315
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,720
Yes?

316
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,490
Have you seen HR?

317
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,380
Maybe he's meditating in his room.

318
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,140
No, he's not there.

319
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,090
HR, you're needed in the Speed Lab, now.

320
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,790
He could be doing inversion stretches in the intake.

321
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,780
You saw that too, huh?

322
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,420
HR! He's not there.

323
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,900
Probably just brewing another pot of coffee.

324
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,840
- It's all he drinks. - Not that either.

325
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,350
Okay. Why do you need him so badly?

326
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,750
He's going through my stuff, but now...

327
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,550
He's just being stupid about it.

328
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,410
Stupid about what?

329
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,010
God, I swear I fixed the security system.

330
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,230
Who the hell are you?

331
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,360
HR
HR.

332
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,850
Apologies.

333
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,120
HR
HR.

334
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,690
See? Ah. What you've just been witness to

335
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,260
was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.

336
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,360
Okay, I see what's going on here.

337
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,490
You don't have facial transmogrification

338
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,830
on this planet, do you?

339
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,350
No, we certainly do not.

340
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,740
Well then,

341
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,760
it's a good thing for me I found this little contraption

342
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,090
in my satchel-forgot I brought it.

343
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,100
It's so fun.

344
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,770
So fun? How does this work?

345
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,670
Light refraction technology.

346
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,990
Light refraction?

347
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,560
I think--I don't-- Randolf,

348
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,310
my--business partner,

349
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,940
he's sort of more with the science.

350
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,960
But this little sucker is gonna go a long way

351
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,470
to solving my Harrison Wells facial issues.

352
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,910
I'm gonna hang onto this until I get my power cuffs back.

353
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,170
What, your power cuffs?

354
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,260
Your meta-human power-dampening cuffs?

355
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,170
Those very ones, the ones that are missing all of a sudden.

356
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,970
What--you think-- you think I took them?

357
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,620
I didn't take them. What do I need cuffs for?

358
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,370
I just got to this Earth. I came alone.

359
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,350
I haven't met anyone yet; it's gonna take a while,

360
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,680
even when I do meet them, to get to the cuff stage.

361
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,410
Hey, guys?

362
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,790
Guys, I need you in the Cortex.

363
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,950
Killed by a shadow? That's a new one.

365
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,940
Maybe that's what killed Edward Clariss.

366
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,500
Clariss was a meta-human.

367
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,970
This victim doesn't appear to be.

368
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,020
Do we know if this shadow meta is from the

369
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,640
particle accelerator explosion or from Dr. Alchemy?

370
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,630
Not yet, no.

371
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,760
We actually haven't found any evidence to process.

372
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,940
If only we had a way, Francisco,

373
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,190
to see what happened.

374
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,370
Where was the crime scene located?

375
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,800
In Chubbuck, uh, Palmer and Racine,

376
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,580
around 11 last night.

377
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,150
That's gonna give me night terrors.

378
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,030
- Shade. - What?

379
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,080
We had a meta-hominid on my planet

380
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,160
who could do virtually the same thing,

381
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,730
called himself "Shade."

382
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,910
What did he do, throw his side-eye at his enemies?

383
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,580
Few I know, it's a terrible nickname, right?

384
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,360
But what Shade could do was vibrate at such a high frequency

385
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,270
he created the illusion that he was a shadow.

386
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,440
That's how I phase.

387
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,500
Do you think he's doing the same thing?

388
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,370
He has to be.

389
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,520
Heat signature's fluctuating.

390
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Red shift is ridiculous.

391
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,900
Okay, so he is.

392
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,670
He must be slowing down his molecules whenever he attacks.

393
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,600
So we just have to figure out a way to keep them slowed down,

394
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,510
and that should be enough to grab him.

395
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,730
All right, can you get started?

396
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,940
Okay, but, like, right this minute?

397
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,820
Yeah, I'm sor--we just--

398
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,790
we gotta stop this guy fast so we can focus on Alchemy.

399
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,270
Wally has been having

400
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,850
dreams about being a speedster,

401
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,610
Alchemy dreams.

402
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,280
He was a speedster in Flashpoint?

403
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,220
Anyone else gonna have powers we should know about?

404
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,340
No.

405
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,830
All right. I'm gonna work on Shade.

406
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,710
- I'll supervise. - You're gonna find my cuffs.

407
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,110
I'll have to find some cuffs.

408
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,550
All right, I got to get back to work

409
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,460
before Julian loses his mind.

411
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,330
Wally, it's your dad, again.

412
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,740
Just give me a call back, all right?

413
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,700
Or a text, I just need to know you're okay.

414
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,060
I'm okay.

415
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,510
Wally.

416
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,650
You can't do that.

417
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,440
You can't just disappear.

418
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,140
I just wanted to let you know

419
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm fine, so.

420
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,630
Come here.

421
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,630
Listen, you were right.

422
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,350
I do treat Barry differently than I treat you.

423
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,270
But not because I think Barry's better than you.

424
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,670
Then why?

425
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,330
Wally, you're a lot like I was as a kid.

426
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,400
You're fearless and you take risks

427
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,470
and that makes you a handful just like I was.

428
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,480
And now you're getting powers.

429
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,150
That alone would make me nervous

430
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,390
because I know what I would have done if I got powers.

431
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,310
But you're not getting your speed

432
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,120
the same way Barry got his.

433
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,430
You're getting your speed the way

434
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,720
Magenta and The Rival got theirs.

435
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,200
So it's not that I don't trust you, Wally, it's just

436
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,880
I don't trust what's going on with you right now.

437
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,790
And that scares the living hell out of me.

438
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,260
I know, Dad.

439
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,900
I get it.

440
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,890
Okay, so

441
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,000
let's get you to S.T.A.R. Labs

442
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,890
- and see what we can do. - All right.

443
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,190
Wallace.

444
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,740
Wallace West.

445
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,440
Wally.

446
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,940
Wally!

447
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,350
Hey, Cisco.

448
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,470
Yes?

449
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,480
I took your cuffs.

450
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,850
Why?

451
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,210
Because I need them.

452
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,950
Is--is this some sort of, um,

453
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,440
bold fashion choice 'cause you're not a meta-hu--hu--

454
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
human.

455
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,070
Surprise.

456
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,560
It started a few months ago.

457
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,020
That's why you went to see your mom,

458
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,220
to see if she could help you.

459
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,480
But she can't.

460
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,280
I've run every test.

461
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,120
There's nothing that anyone can do.

462
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,680
I need a favor.

463
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,780
I need you to vibe me in the future

464
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,950
because I need to know if I become...

465
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,760
her.

466
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,520
You're not gonna become her.

467
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,510
Okay, just because you have these powers

468
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,790
doesn't mean you're gonna turn into Killer Frost.

469
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,790
I think it might.

470
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,070
Please?

471
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I just need to know for sure.

472
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,700
I need to know if I become evil

473
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,710
because if I do, I have to leave

474
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,300
and never come back.

475
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,440
And?

476
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,050
I didn't see anything.

477
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,400
You're fine.

478
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,620
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

479
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,700
Please, um,

480
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,420
don't tell anyone about this yet, okay?

481
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,540
- Of course. - Okay.

482
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,060
According to this, all your vitals are fine, Wally.

483
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,600
Wally, what did you see?

484
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,030
I was Kid Flash again,

485
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,150
but this time it wasn't a good dream.

486
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,180
I was fighting The Rival at some abandoned sawmill.

487
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,940
That's what happened in Flashpoint before you got hurt.

488
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,210
They're not just dreams,

489
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,450
they must be memories of that life.

490
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,420
More and more people are getting powers.

491
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,890
Okay, so how do we stop this?

492
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,280
I mean, is there any stopping it even?

493
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,380
If Alchemy could reach you at CCPD,

494
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,950
he could probably reach you from anywhere, right?

495
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,700
I have a suggestion.

496
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,120
Why don't we throw Wallace in the pipeline

497
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,560
until we figure this situation out.

498
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,530
You want to lock him up?

499
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,220
Yeah, I agree with Joe, we lock him up

500
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,080
because think about this.

501
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,150
We can't stop Alchemy from getting into Wallace's head,

502
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,770
but we put him in the pipeline, then we control the situation

503
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,490
from there on out.

504
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,350
As much as I don't like it, Dad,

505
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,300
maybe he's not wrong.

506
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,390
But only till we figure out

507
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,650
a better way to make you safe.

508
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,730
Yeah, I agree with Joe.

509
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,240
I'm gonna cancel this movie with Cecile.

510
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,870
Wait, wait, you've got a date with Cecile?

511
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,520
Yeah, I was gonna bring her

512
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,150
to movie in the park tonight.

513
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,530
Well, don't not go.

514
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,730
You've put your life on hold for us long enough.

515
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,230
Yeah, Dad, he's right, I mean,

516
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,870
go be Joe West; you're always Dad.

517
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,230
Yeah, we'll stay with Wally, and make sure nothing happens.

518
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,020
I told her all of you were coming with me.

519
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,630
Am I gonna be the only one that shows up?

520
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,590
I would love to see a movie.

521
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,550
- What movie is this? - "The Shining."

522
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,240
"The Shining," oh, I love that movie.

523
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,330
That movie freaks you out.

524
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,060
You have never made it past the part with the Grady twins.

525
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,900
That's--that's-- that was--

526
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,760
I was younger.

527
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,910
Why don't I go with you?

528
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,360
You sure you don't want stay...

529
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,500
No, I want to be with you.

530
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,040
Either way, the more the merrier.

531
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,640
Let's do it.

532
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,530
Hell, this will be great fodder for my novel.

533
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,050
Hold on, you guys didn't tell him about?

534
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,360
Joe, no.

535
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,820
They--they told me,

536
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,650
finally, the little scamps.

537
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,090
But I think that I've worked my way

538
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,500
around that little problem.

539
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,710
Watch this.

540
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,410
Let me just...

541
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,670
What--what did you do?

542
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,890
Did you just neuralyze us?

543
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,020
No, I gave you a simple retinal adjustment

544
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,200
so all of you can see me, HR,

545
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,230
while the rest of the world sees...

546
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,060
Randolf Morgan.

547
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,830
Joe, I promise, I'll be so--I'll be so quiet.

548
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,800
You won't even know I'm there. Silent observer.

549
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,450
All right.

550
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,820
Wally, keep me posted.

551
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,920
Yeah, I'll be fine.

552
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,990
Just go have fun.

553
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,030
That's great.

555
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,190
All right, we want to be 2/3 to the back,

556
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,790
- right in the middle. - That's a very small screen.

557
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,160
Like, I don't know if we're gonna be able to see from--

558
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,610
No, HR, the screen is perfect, okay?

559
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,080
- We'll be able to see fine. - But we're so far--

560
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,480
That's where the engineer sits

561
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,960
- when he mixes the sound, all right? - All right.

563
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,530
When you want to get the Kubrick experience, that's...

564
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,920
- All right, yeah. - The sweet spot, right there.

565
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,180
I don't know, maybe we get a little closer, like right by...

566
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,480
Why don't you let us worry about the seats?

567
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,800
You take care of the snacks and the drinks.

568
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,780
Great idea.

569
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,720
Any time.

570
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,520
Oh, I don't--

571
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,770
I'm pretty sure they're

572
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,070
not gonna take the money from my Earth.

573
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,500
- I don't think. - What?

574
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,140
- What is this? - That's a helbing.

575
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,120
Here's what you're gonna do.

576
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,530
You're gonna get us what we need,

577
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,570
you're gonna do that, go over to that stand over there.

578
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,090
- Great idea. - You're gonna get us some

579
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,790
licorice sticks, some Jujubes.

580
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,260
Licorice...Juju...

581
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,640
Yeah, and coffee.

582
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,470
Do you want anything?

583
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,790
- No thanks. - Okay.

584
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,870
Okay.

585
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,750
You okay, Cisco?

586
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,080
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

587
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,620
just trying to deal with HR.

588
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,650
Yeah, 'cause you've been on edge

589
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,530
ever since you vibed me.

590
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,820
Are you gonna tell me what you saw?

591
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,950
What? I told you what I saw.

592
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,000
No, but, for real.

593
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,050
I can tell when you're not being honest with me.

594
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,600
Am I her?

595
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,850
Yeah.

596
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,400
Yeah, you're her.

597
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,080
I--I saw the both of us

598
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,380
fighting.

599
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,020
Like full-on Vibe versus Killer Frost.

600
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,540
It's like we're meta-frenemies.

601
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,480
Well, have you ever vibed anything from the future

602
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,020
that didn't come true?

603
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,460
Just Earth-2 being ripped to shreds.

604
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,600
But that doesn't mean that can't happen again.

605
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,140
Caitlin,

606
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,530
you have to tell them.

607
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,080
You have to tell the team.

608
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,550
We have to figure out what's going on.

609
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,520
No. It's too late.

610
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,960
There's nothing you can do.

611
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,040
Nobody else needs to know.

612
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,460
I haven't been to a movie in forever.

613
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,840
I come whenever I can, I mean,

614
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,310
sort of a summer tradition with the kids.

615
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,400
Yeah?

616
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,170
You know, it's funny, you don't really peg me

617
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,890
for a, uh, horror movie type.

618
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,260
I thought maybe you'd be more of a chick-flicky.

619
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,240
- Oh, you got jokes. - Yeah.

620
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,500
I might be mad if you weren't so gorgeous.

621
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,350
Gorgeous, really?

622
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,100
If I'm so gorgeous, then how come you're

623
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,810
spending more time looking at that than you are at me?

624
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,770
You know what?

625
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,010
You're right, Cecile, I'm sorry.

626
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,160
My son, Wally, he's...

627
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,050
going through some changes and I'm just--

628
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,100
Just really concerned.

629
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,510
Joe, we can do this another time.

630
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,410
No-no-no-no, I really want to be here with you, I do.

631
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,120
It's just that when one of my kids is hurting I'm...

632
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,510
Can't think about anything else at all.

633
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,650
Completely understand.

634
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,560
- You have kids? - Yeah.

635
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,800
Daughter.

636
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:57,960
Just turned 18.

637
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,740
I have less than a year before she leaves me for college.

638
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,510
Oh, man, you should have brought her.

639
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,770
I drag you away from her so you can watch a horror movie.

640
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:07,240
Not many men could.

641
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,800
I'm just glad you finally figured out what you want.

642
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,440
Me too.

643
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,430
Wally, you okay?

644
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,960
I hate that we have to do this.

645
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,070
He so badly wanted powers, and, now, to keep him locked up

646
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,990
so he doesn't get them, it's...

647
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,430
It's hard, I know.

648
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,160
I don't know if you actually do.

649
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,270
What does that mean?

650
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,190
All Wally wants to do is to help people.

651
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,130
And to see you do that every day while all he can do

652
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,550
is stand by and watch,

653
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,010
It's hard being a bystander sometimes.

654
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,570
You don't feel that way too, do you?

655
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,660
Barry...

656
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,150
Come on.

657
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,900
My contributions here are limited.

658
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,660
I don't know science.

659
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,050
I don't have powers.

660
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,620
I don't know how to help you.

661
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,520
I couldn't do this without you.

662
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,710
That's not true.

663
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,830
That is true.

664
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,060
Whether you realize it or not, there is no Flash

665
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,530
without Iris West.

666
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,740
I'm wolfing this.

667
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,240
- I'm telling you, it's so good. - It is good.

668
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,040
What is it about popcorn and the movies?

669
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,170
Hey, you okay?

670
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,540
Yeah, fine.

671
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,760
- Hi, I'm Caitlin. - Hi.

672
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,560
Cecile. Nice to meet you.

673
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,130
- And you must be Cisco. - That's me.

674
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,040
Nice to meet you.

675
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,090
Don't forget about me.

676
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,290
Hello.

677
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,960
I'm HR.

678
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,440
HR Randolf.

679
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,160
It's amazing to meet you.

680
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,430
- All right, now. - Amazing.

681
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,060
And so then-- then she says to me,

682
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,650
"Oh, so you are hot chocolate from another land."

683
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,070
I said, "Okay, easy, now."

684
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,490
Then she, "Wait a minute.

685
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,680
Do you speak a foreign language?"

686
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,370
What did you say?

687
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,080
Well, I said, "Sure."

688
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,560
"As long as I know the words."

689
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,070
"As long as I know the words."

690
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm gonna smack somebody.

695
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,820
Everybody, move, move!

696
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,690
It's Shade.

697
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,280
He's at Hofherr Park.

698
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,670
Wallace.

699
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,850
Wallace West.

700
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,560
The time has come

701
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,800
to restore what was taken from you.

702
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,580
The time has come

703
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,700
to set you free.

704
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,640
Hey, hey, the same thing happened to Frankie.

705
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,490
You have to fight through the pain.

706
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,930
Are you okay?

707
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,130
I think so.

710
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,120
Find me.

711
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,960
And I will release you from all of this.

712
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,400
Wally, what is it?

713
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,560
You have to open the door.

714
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,650
I--I can't do that, Wally. I can't.

715
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,740
I can make you whole again.

716
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,910
Open the door! I need to get out!

717
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,960
Now!

718
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,270
Flash, just who I came to see.

719
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,020
So you like shadows?

720
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,250
Want to try and catch mine?

721
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,910
Barry, we're in the van. Can you hear us?

722
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,000
And I just got tossed on my ass like a rag doll.

723
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,990
That's not good.

724
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,280
All right, guys,

725
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,270
I cannot do anything if I can't see him.

726
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,880
Can we light this place up?

727
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,840
Light's gonna slow down his molecular vibration

728
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,210
so we can catch him.

729
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,560
How are we gonna light this place up?

730
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,950
- See all these cars? - Yeah.

731
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,620
- I hack into their computers. - Yeah?

732
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,480
- The park's overhead lights. - Yeah?

733
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,590
Blast this guy with more lumens

734
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,390
than a Pink Floyd concert. - Yeah.

735
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,620
What are you doing?

736
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,820
He's gonna need these.

737
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,560
- She took... - She took the cuffs.

738
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,190
Okay, just drop it, all right?

739
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,370
Barry, I'm in.

740
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,440
Okay.

741
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,630
All right, wait until my mark.

742
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,540
And by mark,

743
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,860
I do mean

744
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,540
next time that I get punched.

745
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,990
Mark.

746
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,390
Flash!

747
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,420
Don't like the light, do you?

748
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,770
Nowhere to hide now.

749
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,550
Get me out. Get me out--ah!

750
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,380
Help me!

751
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,080
Please, make it stop.

752
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,830
- Iris! - Hey, Wally, Wally, Wally, look.

753
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,310
It's over, okay? Come on, come on...

754
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,570
Find me.

755
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,640
Stay out of my way.

756
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,270
Wally, stop.

757
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,710
Stay out of my way!

758
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,100
Wally wasn't himself.

759
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,900
He was possessed.

760
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,370
Alchemy was calling for him.

761
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,730
I knew I shouldn't have left.

762
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,650
It's okay, Joe, nothing happened.

763
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,130
He's not okay, Barry.

764
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,520
This thing's coming after him, and--

765
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,790
and there ain't a damn thing we can do?

766
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,870
Well, we stopped Shade.

767
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,950
And now we can focus on Alchemy, all right?

768
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,020
Unless he sends another meta to Central City to attack.

769
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,920
Then we're in trouble.

770
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,300
You think Shade was a distraction?

771
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,920
I agree with Iris I think the attack on Wally

772
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,420
and the attack by Shade happened at essentially the same time.

773
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,200
So that's not a coincidence.

774
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,510
If that's true, that means Alchemy's gonna sending

775
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,610
another one of his metas soon.

776
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,790
We don't know that.

777
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,040
Barry, we found six husks.

778
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,510
So besides Shade, Magenta, and Clariss,

779
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,200
there's still three unaccounted for.

780
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,410
Okay, well, if more come, then we'll stop them.

781
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,320
But Alchemy can't get Wally if he stays in the cell.

782
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,890
Barry, we can't just let Wally suffer in there.

783
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,130
And besides, burying our head in the sand

784
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,900
is not gonna make Alchemy go away.

785
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,730
Ignoring the problem does not get rid of it.

786
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,320
You're gonna have to face it.

787
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,400
Don't we?

788
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,790
- What? - Nothing.

789
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,190
Come on, Caitlin.

790
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,130
Not right now, Cisco.

791
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,060
I--just--I can't just keep this in.

792
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,500
You have to tell them.

793
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,350
Tell them what?

794
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,210
I have powers.

795
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,340
What?

796
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,340
What kind of powers?

797
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,180
The cold kind.

798
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:42,000
Happy now?

799
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,330
So, what, we're just gonna keep secrets from each other?

800
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,990
Yeah, well, this wasn't your secret to tell,

801
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,180
was it, Cisco?

802
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,430
I did that because I care about you.

803
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,620
If you cared about me, then you would have

804
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,480
let me tell them all when I was ready.

805
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,910
Because this is happening to me, not you.

806
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,970
I'm the one turning evil.

807
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,480
I'm the one who's gonna have to leave soon.

808
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,970
I vibed the two of us fighting each other in the future.

809
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,750
She was Killer Frost.

810
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,310
- I'll go talk to her. - I got it.

811
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,320
How long have you known?

812
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,630
A few months.

813
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,800
First I didn't want to accept what was happening to me.

814
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,670
And then I had to.

815
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,220
So then I tried to suppress my powers.

816
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,620
There's no suppressing these powers.

817
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,510
I just can't believe that this is my life.

818
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,680
It shouldn't be.

819
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,030
None of what's happening to any of you should be.

820
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,210
What do you mean, any of us?

821
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:06,330
I mean...

822
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,120
Dr. Alchemy.

823
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:10,840
Wally.

824
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,810
You getting powers.

825
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,810
Even Dante being dead in this timeline.

826
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,960
It's all because I created Flashpoint.

827
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,460
Even Iris, who, I don't know, I think

828
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,890
she's disappointed that she doesn't have powers

829
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,810
and everyone else does.

830
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,510
And no matter what I do now,

831
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,810
everything's different.

832
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,260
So none of this happened before?

833
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,980
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

834
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,470
Wally's up.

835
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,390
Okay.

836
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,490
How you feeling?

837
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,990
I've been better.

838
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,250
What do we do?

839
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,890
We got to come up with something.

840
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,490
Use me.

841
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,510
No. No, no, hell no.

842
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,190
Alchemy's calling for me to go to him.

843
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,190
Follow me wherever he is,

844
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,290
and we can stop him.

845
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,840
No. We're not asking you to do that.

846
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,350
This is our chance to stop him

847
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,540
We have to do it.

848
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,600
Wally...

849
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,120
Dad, he--he wants me.

850
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,950
He's hurting me.

851
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,810
So let me fight back.

852
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,190
Wally?

853
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,810
Find me.

854
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:29,980
Turn him on his side.

855
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,660
All right, get him over, come on.

856
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,850
This should help.

857
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,180
It's a mild sedative.

858
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,540
- What is that? - Lorazepam.

859
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,530
It works on seizures.

860
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,530
Hopefully it'll work on whatever this is.

861
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,760
These episodes keep happening more frequently.

862
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,220
Yeah, and this is just a temporary fix.

863
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,450
If we don't stop it too, he could suffer

864
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,140
from permanent brain damage.

865
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,660
We don't have a choice.

866
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,910
We have to do what Wally wanted; we have to

867
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,150
use him to find Alchemy.

868
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,700
No, we're no-- it's too dangerous.

869
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,500
So is doing nothing.

870
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,610
Need I remind everyone that Dr. Alchemy

871
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,220
has a rock that shoots lasers, so

872
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,030
who knows what he has up his sleeve?

873
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,080
Cisco's right.

874
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,670
What if we're walking into a trap?

875
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,350
You guys aren't walking into anything.

876
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,770
You guys are gonna stay here.

877
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,380
If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it right.

878
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,270
What does that mean?

879
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,960
It means that if I'm gonna put Wally at risk,

880
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,110
I'm gonna use everything in my power to protect him.

881
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,320
Double-check your packs. Make sure we have everything.

882
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,910
- Good to go. - Okay.

883
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,230
So what's the plan, Detective?

884
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,750
This lunatic, calls himself Alchemy,

885
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:26,380
he's the one responsible for all these husks

886
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,180
we've been finding all over town.

887
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,630
But we believe we found a way to get his location.

888
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,550
How?

889
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:36,070
By using his next target.

890
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:37,950
Your son?

891
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,740
We'll stop him, Joe.

892
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,230
Where's Julian?

893
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,550
He didn't come in today.

894
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,070
What, he never misses a day. You call him?

895
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,720
Yeah, it went straight to voicemail.

896
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,220
Well.

897
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,300
All right, gents, move out.

898
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,360
Let's roll.

899
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,530
All right, be safe.

900
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,690
We'll see you in a few.

901
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,950
You ready?

902
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,090
Yeah.

903
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,690
Hey, you remember when I said that you remind me

904
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,260
of myself as a kid?

905
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,880
I was never this brave.

906
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,150
They've just left.

907
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,970
I'm almost done. I'll be right there.

908
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,700
Cisco, I am so sorry about how I reacted.

909
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,470
I understand why you told everyone.

910
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:25,240
Never helps when we keep things from each other.

911
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,000
You're right.

912
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,130
And I'm glad that you told everyone.

913
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,020
I'm just not very good at asking for help.

914
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,830
I get that from my mom.

915
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,080
You're better than your mother.

916
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,150
I don't know.

917
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,950
I'm just so terrified because she said

918
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,150
if I keep using my powers, then

919
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,810
it'll be impossible to stop them.

920
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,010
Your mother might be one of the most accomplished

921
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,290
scientists on this planet,

922
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,830
but when it comes to the impossible,

923
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:02,100
we're the experts.

924
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,460
We're gonna help you, Caitlin.

925
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,940
- Okay? - Okay.

926
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,270
Let's go help Wally.

927
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,150
You got it.

928
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,750
We're moving in.

929
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,240
Just remember, once you get in there,

930
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,330
we're not gonna have eyes

931
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,310
Copy that.

932
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,680
Of course, dude uses an abandoned subway to set up shop.

933
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,610
Of course he does.

934
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,400
Where's Grodd when you need him?

935
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,190
Gro--Gorilla Grodd?

936
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,130
You have sentient gorillas on your Earth too?

937
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,730
Oh, yeah, yeah, we do, many.

938
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,880
Many. Yeah.

939
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,510
Come to me.

940
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,530
Wallace.

941
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,110
Everybody set?

942
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,140
We're good.

943
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,590
Just lead the way.

944
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,400
You okay?

945
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,800
Yeah.

946
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
It's okay to be scared, Wally.

947
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,970
I am.

948
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:29,920
You are?

949
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,980
Keeps me alert.

950
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,320
Then I'm on high alert.

951
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,310
Let's do this.

952
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,520
Hello, Wally.

953
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,660
Are you him?

954
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,400
Are you the voice I've been hearing inside my head?

955
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,960
I am Alchemy.

956
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,940
I've been having visions

957
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,890
of another life.

958
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,050
Where--where I have speed, where, I'm...

959
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,150
The Flash.

960
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,380
I can give you that back,

961
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,870
should you desire it.

962
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,950
I just want the pain to stop.

963
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,550
It will, child.

964
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,590
Whatever you desire,

965
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,780
I will see it so.

966
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,450
Now tell me,

967
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,250
do you wish for the life that was taken from you

968
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,940
to return?

969
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,600
What I wish for...

970
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,970
is all of you gone.

971
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,690
It's a trap!

972
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,700
The boy has been chosen, Flash.

973
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,200
And you will not stand before what must be...

974
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,570
Ever again!

975
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,920
No!

976
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,670
Get on your knees!

977
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:51,050
Now! Don't move! Don't move!

978
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,440
Get down!

979
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,260
On the ground.

980
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,150
I said get on the ground.

981
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,140
That was a grave mistake.

982
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,810
- You okay? - I'll be fine.

983
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,430
Wally?

984
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,690
Yeah.

985
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,920
It's over, Alchemy.

986
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,150
Over?

987
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,590
You have no idea

988
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,630
what's about to begin.

989
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,610
What the hell?

990
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,080
Did you guys see that?

991
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,130
See what?

992
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,710
Go. Get the hell out of here!

993
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,160
Wally, move towards the door! Stick with me!

994
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,750
The other way! The other way! Go! Go! Go! Go!

995
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,820
Wally, go!

996
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,480
You all right?

997
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,200
Wallace.

998
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,050
Wallace West.

999
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,480
Take your power.

1000
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,260
Wally.

1001
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,740
Wally, don't!

1002
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,750
Wally!

1003
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,630
Who are you?

1004
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,010
Savitar.

1005
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,710
The God of Speed.
