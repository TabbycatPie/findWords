14
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,760
My name is Barry Allen.

15
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,040
I am the fastest man alive.

16
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,170
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

17
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,850
I saw a ball of lightning.

18
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,150
Inside the lightning there was a man.

19
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,570
He killed my mom.

20
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,060
I swear to God I didn't do this.

21
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,200
- Where's mom? - What happened that night was impossible.

22
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,750
Then an accident made me the impossible.

23
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,170
You were in a coma.

24
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,160
- For how long? - Nine months.

25
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,510
Your muscles should be atrophied,

26
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,610
but instead they're in a state of cellular regeneration.

27
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,790
I wasn't the only one affected, was I?

28
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,730
We've been searching for other meta humans like yourself.

29
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,970
All my life I've wanted to do more.

30
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,840
And the first chance I get to help someone, I screw up.

31
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,470
The good you do must far outweigh the bad.

32
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,360
You're not gonna be in here much longer.

33
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,210
Whoever killed mom,

34
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,900
I think I finally have a way to find them.

35
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,270
This is the part where I'm supposed

36
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,960
to do the whole intro thingy.

37
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,830
Barry Allen, fastest man alive...

38
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,060
But you know all that already.

39
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,070
All right, let's get to the good stuff.

40
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,880
You see that smoke? That's a fire

41
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,590
on Western and 3rd in downtown Central City.

42
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,390
And that blur? That's me on my way to it.

43
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,350
I'm going 352 miles an hour.

44
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,880
And it's a slow day.

45
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,510
This is Ladder 52.

46
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,940
We're still at least two minutes out.

47
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,310
People are gonna die in there.

48
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,270
I know.

49
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,480
Barry?

50
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,370
Barry!

51
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,290
What? Did I miss it?

52
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,460
You overshot by about six blocks.

53
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,300
My bad.

54
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,200
Paige!

55
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,850
My daughter! Has anyone seen my daughter?

56
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,890
Paige!

57
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,660
You there yet?

58
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,150
What are you doing?

59
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:42,950
Nothing.

60
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,390
Who were you talking to?

61
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,240
- No one. - Are you talking to Barry?

62
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,750
- Who? - Barry Allen?

63
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,810
Struck by lighting? Was in a coma for nine months?

64
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,170
Woke up being able to run faster than the speed of sound?

65
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,410
- Ring a bell? - No.

66
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,630
Haven't talked to him.

67
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,360
Cisco, there's fire everywhere!

68
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,570
Cisco, are you still there?

69
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,670
Mom?

70
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,080
Mommy!

71
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,480
Mommy!

72
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,070
Everybody's out.

73
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,730
What else you got for me, Cisco?

74
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,310
Barry, it's Caitlin.

75
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,060
Hey, Caitlin.

76
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,050
How's your day?

77
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,420
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs. Now.

78
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,260
On my way.

80
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,620
Have you both lost your minds?

81
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,920
Who do you think you are?

82
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,510
Well, I'm the eyes and ears, and he's the feet.

83
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,450
This isn't funny.

84
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,340
You could have gotten yourself killed.

85
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,020
You can't be running around the city

86
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,830
like some supersonic fireman.

87
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,740
Why not?

88
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,920
This is what we talked about: Me using my speed to do good.

89
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,820
We talked about you helping us contain

90
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,150
other people who might have been affected

91
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,330
by the particle accelerator explosion.

92
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,440
Meta-humans.

93
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,610
And aside from Clyde Mardon, we haven't found any.

94
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,780
People in this city still need help.

95
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,900
And I can help them.

96
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,220
We can help them.

97
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,390
Will you please say something?

98
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,380
I think what Caitlin is saying,

99
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,550
in her own spectacularly angry way,

100
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,430
is that we are just beginning to understand

101
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,770
what your body is capable of.

102
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,630
Not to sound like a broken record, Mr. Allen...

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,420
I do caution restraint.

104
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,300
Dr. Wells...

105
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,010
I doubt restraint is how you got to be the man you are today.

106
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,280
In a wheelchair and a pariah.

107
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,310
Lack of restraint is what made me these things.

108
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,980
Know your limits.

109
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,430
Don't expect me to patch you up

110
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,120
every time you break something.

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,180
Hey, uh... anything happen out there today?

112
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,650
The sensors in the suit were kicking back

113
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,770
some weird telemetry,

114
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,800
like your vitals spiked for a few seconds.

115
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,720
Never felt better.

116
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,280
Hey, Joe, everything all right?

117
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,790
Great. I got a fresh crime scene...

118
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:05,780
a dead body...

119
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,620
detectives interviewing witnesses...

120
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,700
Miles of that yellow tape stretched over everything.

121
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,010
I'm only missing one thing. Can you guess what that is?

122
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,410
I'll be right there.

123
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,640
My day job beckons.

124
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,900
When do you think he'll realize

125
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,680
he didn't take his clothes?

126
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,640
Perp made off with a bunch of handguns,

127
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,100
at least six Glock 19s.

128
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,810
Fitted with extra ammunition magazines.

129
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,840
Somebody's looking to do a whole lot of bad.

130
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,740
Hey, sorry I'm late.

131
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,400
Doing a little fall shopping, Mr. Allen?

132
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,010
I was going so fast this morning, I didn't even notice.

133
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,290
I downloaded the surveillance footage off the video camera.

134
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,380
Looks like only one perp.

135
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,310
Footage may only show one, but it was six guys.

136
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,640
Look, the tracks. They're all crossing each other.

137
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,090
Six sets of footprints. Six guns stolen.

138
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,420
We should be looking for a crew.

139
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,150
Weird.

140
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,550
The shoes, it looks like they're all the same size.

141
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,660
Men's tens, I'd guess.

142
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,100
Just like you, Captain.

143
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,270
Not that you're a suspect, sir. I--

144
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,460
Your ability to multi-task is truly remarkable.

146
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,500
The way you can embarrass me, the Captain, and yourself

147
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,760
- all at the same time. - Joe, I'm sorry.

148
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,260
I'm starting to think "Joe, I'm sorry" is

149
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,040
my actual name considering how often you say it to me.

150
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,050
I'm dealing with a lot right now.

151
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,300
Look, I know you are.

152
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,140
Believe me, I'm dealing with it, too.

153
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,620
I've always had a very simple set of beliefs.

154
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,650
Gravity makes things fall. Water makes things wet.

155
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,150
And up until a few weeks ago, I believed

156
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,620
the fastest man could run a mile in four minutes.

157
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,720
Not four seconds.

158
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,890
I could do it in three.

159
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,810
Not relevant.

160
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,230
You haven't said anything to Iris about all this, have you?

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,450
No, I made you a promise. I keep my promises.

162
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,400
Keep on lying like that,

163
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,220
you're liable to get struck by lightning again.

164
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,490
Get up to the lab.

165
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,920
Start processing the evidence from the gun store.

166
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,760
Hey, Iris.

167
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,290
Did Barry run away again?

168
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,350
Unless that's one of your homework questions, little lady,

169
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,500
it's none of your business.

170
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,640
Go on back to your room.

171
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,000
I want to see my dad.

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,330
I already said no, Barry.

173
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,010
He didn't do those things. He didn't hurt my mom.

174
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,750
I was there that night. I saw.

175
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,610
- There was a man. - Yeah, I know.

176
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,330
We've gone through this already.

177
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,650
Then why can't I go see him?

178
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,490
Because I said so.

179
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,790
You're not my father! You can't tell me what to do!

180
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,030
Right now, I am the only adult that gives a damn

181
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,690
what happens to you, so yes, I can tell you what to do.

182
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,050
Now go to your room.

183
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,350
I hate you!

184
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,670
This is all of your fault.

185
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,050
I could have taken European folklore

186
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,190
to cover my sociology requirement, but no.

187
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,890
You said, "Take journalism, Iris.

188
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,430
Reporters have all of the fun."

189
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,850
Guess what, Barry? Reporters have none of the fun.

190
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,850
Journalism is boring. I'm bored.

191
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,560
I blame you. What?

192
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,070
Why are you staring at me like that?

193
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,100
You look really nice.

194
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,620
Thanks.

195
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,670
Why don't you look nice?

196
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,150
This afternoon? Suit and tie?

197
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,000
The university is giving Simon Stagg...

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,710
- Simon Stagg. - some big award.

199
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,460
- And you agreed... - To explain the science stuff

200
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,650
for your article. It's all coming back to me now.

201
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,670
How fast can you get home and change?

202
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,480
Pretty fast.

203
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,830
Hey, Allen.

204
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,470
Joe asked me to see where you're at

205
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,340
on the evidence from the gun store shooting.

206
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,770
Oh, hey, Iris.

207
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,700
Detective.

208
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,130
Please, guys, just kiss already.

209
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,410
I already know, remember?

210
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,730
Thanks for being so cool about this, Barry.

211
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,320
I know it's not easy keeping a big secret.

212
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,650
I'm getting used to it.

213
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,200
I find it quite remarkable,

215
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,140
having once been a timid freshman

216
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,740
at Central City University,

217
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,480
to be standing before you now,

218
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,430
the Regents Choice for man of the year.

219
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,040
While I very much appreciate the award,

220
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,700
the real honor for me is knowing that

221
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,490
my work in organ transference

222
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,470
helps give people a second chance at life.

223
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,550
Thank you all very much for coming.

224
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,690
Okay. All right, first things first...

225
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,310
Simon Stagg's work in cellular cloning

226
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,480
has led to huge advancements

227
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,490
in the future of organ replacement...

228
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,960
Are journalists allowed to drink on the job?

229
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,450
Okay. If you are bored already,

230
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,640
just wait till we get to the science behind

231
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,130
cellular regeneration.

232
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,620
I have missed this, Barry.

233
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,540
I feel like we haven't spent any quality time together

234
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,040
since you woke up from the coma.

235
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,610
Yeah, I've had a crazy few weeks, I know.

236
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,770
I thought maybe you'd been avoiding me because of Eddie.

237
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,550
I know you think it's wrong, me dating my dad's partner,

238
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,550
- and I just-- - No.

239
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,480
That is not it. At all.

240
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,940
Mr. Stagg, I was wondering if I could get a quote

241
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,040
from you for my article.

242
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,170
Not now, miss.

243
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,940
I'll just make something up.

244
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,920
So... what were you gonna tell me?

245
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,600
You looked like you were about to say something.

246
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,620
Yeah--

247
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,470
Quiet down! All of you!

248
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,690
Oh, my god.

249
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,550
Quiet!

250
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:24,760
How considerate!

251
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,510
You're all wearing your finest jewelry!

252
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,280
Almost like you knew we were coming to rob you!

253
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,790
Now everybody line up!

254
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,230
Don't. Don't.

255
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,270
Freeze!

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,460
D-d-drop your weapons!

258
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,280
Barry.

259
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,840
Barry.

260
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,400
Barry!

261
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,530
I turned around and you were gone.

262
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,040
What happened? Are you okay?

263
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,070
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I...

264
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,100
I went after them to try and get the plates.

265
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,130
- Wha--? - And I...

266
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,730
I fainted.

267
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,620
- Hi. - Iris.

268
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,260
Where were you?

269
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,570
Dad, go easy.

270
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,230
I found him outside. He fainted.

271
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,290
You want me to get you a paramedic, Allen?

272
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,400
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Eddie.

273
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,500
I thought I was dead.

274
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,840
I saw the gun go off, and then-- boom.

275
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,250
Suddenly I'm outside.

276
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,470
I have no idea how I got there.

277
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,420
Let me talk to you for a second.

278
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,490
Yeah.

279
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,680
You chased those gunmen, didn't you?

280
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,860
Yeah, they must be the same guys

281
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,760
that knocked over the gun shop earlier today.

282
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,450
And what were you going to do when you caught them?

283
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,770
Ask them nicely to pull over?

284
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,000
You're not bulletproof.

285
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,150
Wait. Are you?

286
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,100
- No, but-- - Okay.

287
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,710
No more heroics.

288
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,310
Chasing bad guys is not your job.

289
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,140
It's mine. You're not a cop.

290
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,690
Promise me.

291
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,360
Promise.

292
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,810
And you know Iris is not stupid.

293
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,150
Start making better excuses than "I fainted."

294
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,120
I...

295
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,790
You lied to us.

296
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,430
How could you not tell us you're experiencing dizzy spells?

297
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,770
We're your doctors.

298
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:40,830
God knows what's going on inside your body.

299
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:43,270
Your cells are in a constant state of flux.

300
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,620
You could be experiencing cardiopulmonary failure

301
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,890
or a transient ischemic attack.

302
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,010
Mini stroke. Probably not.

303
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,090
You of all people should know that in science, we share.

304
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,100
We do not keep secrets.

305
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,870
Wow... I haven't seen anyone make her that angry since Ronnie.

306
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,960
Ronnie was Caitlin's fiance?

307
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,350
The one that died the night of the accelerator explosion?

308
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,130
Yeah. He is...

309
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,810
missed.

310
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,360
Now...

311
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,280
Let's figure out why this is happening to you.

313
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,190
We're all set.

314
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,440
A little padding. Just in case.

315
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,270
Yeah.

316
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,440
You're sure about this, Cisco?

317
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,460
Most home treadmills have a maximum speed of about

318
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,910
12 miles per hour.

319
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,060
This one has been Cisco'ed. Trust me.

320
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,210
It can handle your speed.

321
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:40,820
Okay.

322
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,430
Heart rate, blood pressure, nerve conduction all normal.

323
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,180
For Barry.

324
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,650
Brainwave function within standard limits.

325
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,860
I told you the treadmill could take it.

326
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,610
Caitlin.

327
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,670
Look at the glucose levels.

328
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,600
Oh, my god. Of course.

329
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,970
- Right? - It was so obvious.

330
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:05,870
Glucose levels. Barry!

331
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,440
We think we know why you keep--

332
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,610
passing out.

334
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,590
Barry!

336
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,960
Where's Barry?

337
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,290
Taking a shower.

338
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,170
At three o'clock in the afternoon?

339
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,400
If I go up those stairs, am I gonna see Barry Allen?

340
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,460
Or are you gonna be grounded for a week for lying to me?

341
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,220
I'm sorry, daddy.

342
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,330
But don't worry. I know where he went.

343
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,150
Me too.

344
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,860
I passed out again?

345
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,000
Total metabolic failure

346
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,380
brought on by acute hypoglycemia.

347
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,510
I'm not eating enough.

348
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,140
So an I.V. bag and I'm good to go?

349
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,240
Try 40.

350
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,040
Guess you were thirsty.

351
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,960
We're gonna need to fashion you a new diet

352
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,490
based on your metabolic changes.

353
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,690
I've done a few calculations. You need to consume

354
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,150
an amount equal to roughly 850 tacos.

355
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,740
Unless we're talking cheese and guac,

356
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,890
which is like a whole other set of equations.

357
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,810
For Mexican, I recommend Tito's.

358
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,000
On Bruckner avenue?

359
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,420
Best burrito in the city.

360
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,850
Detective West.

361
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,590
What brings you to S.T.A.R. labs?

362
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,410
When I couldn't find you at your lab,

363
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,130
I started doing a little research.

364
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,010
Turns out there's been reports of a red streak around the city,

365
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,230
stopping muggers, rescuing people from burning buildings.

366
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,180
You didn't tell him we were working together?

367
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,570
Joe, I can explain.

368
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,430
You already have a job in law enforcement, Barry.

369
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,350
I suggest you get back to it.

370
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Don't look at me. I'm on your side.

371
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,400
Detective.

372
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,780
We all want what's best for Barry.

373
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,800
If you wanted what was best for Barry,

374
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,340
you'd try to talk him out of this lunacy

375
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,380
instead of encouraging him going out there risking his life.

376
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,180
You saw a man control the weather.

377
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,890
What are the police gonna do against someone like that?

378
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,790
Since the accelerator explosion

379
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,820
we suspect there may be more like him.

380
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:34,760
And you're gonna do what?

381
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,130
Catch them?

382
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,960
Are you insane?

383
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,800
You think because you can run real fast

384
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,980
that you're invincible? You're not!

385
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,450
You're just a kid.

386
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,720
My kid.

387
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,260
I'm not your kid, Joe.

388
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,520
And you're not my father.

389
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,810
My father's sitting in iron heights.

390
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,090
Wrongfully convicted.

391
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,030
You were wrong about him.

392
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,160
And you're wrong about this.

393
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Now I may not be able to help him,

394
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,250
but if I can save someone from a burning building

395
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,020
or stop some armed thieves, I'm gonna do it.

396
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,750
And you can't stop me.

397
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,340
So don't try.

398
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,330
You think you're so smart.

399
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,720
All of you.

400
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,750
But you don't know what you don't know.

401
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,120
And I hope that you're clever enough to figure it out

402
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,110
before somebody gets killed.

403
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,020
Where's the rest of your crew?

404
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,570
Just me.

405
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,870
What do you want, Black?

406
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,800
The only thing I still want in life...

407
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,260
Your boss dead.

408
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,510
It's not my fault you and your team moved too slow.

409
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,890
I told you where Stagg would be, not how long he'd be there.

410
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,530
I need his full itinerary.

411
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,880
And security access to his office and home.

412
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,880
Screw you.

413
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,300
I've got a reputation in the security business.

414
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,260
It's one thing if my employer gets iced.

415
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,880
It's another if it happens in his bedroom.

416
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,600
You'll do what I ask, Mr. Java.

417
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,910
What the hell are you gonna do to me without your army?

418
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,350
I am an army.

420
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,680
Come to yell at me again?

421
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,630
Simon Stagg's head of security was murdered last night.

422
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,430
The coroner took some skin samples.

423
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,080
Hopefully they belong to the killer.

424
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,520
See if you can find a match.

425
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,060
Can't be a coincidence that Stagg's benefit was attacked last night.

426
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,480
I'm going to interview Stagg now.

427
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,150
- I'll come with you. - Your job is in here.

428
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,400
Stay in here and do it.

429
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,260
- Hey, dad. - Hey, baby.

430
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,410
Gotta go.

431
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,150
Why is my dad mad at you?

432
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,720
Work stuff.

433
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,460
Why are you mad at me?

434
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,900
You were supposed to meet me at Jitters

435
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,360
to give me some scientific background for my article.

436
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,820
And I didn't show up.

437
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,390
And now I have to come up with a new article topic in 24 hours

438
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,970
or I fail the assignment.

439
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,860
- Iris-- - Don't say that you're sorry.

440
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,320
Okay, I know that you are.

441
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,880
What I don't know is what is going on with you.

442
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,180
We grew up one bedroom down from each other.

443
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,110
Do you honestly think that I don't know when you're happy?

444
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,510
Or sad or depressed or lost?

445
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,250
I'm gonna ask you one last time, Barry Allen,

446
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,170
and you better be honest with me.

447
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,080
What the--

448
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,130
You want to know what's happening.

449
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,770
I'm fast now.

450
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,700
God, I just want to tell you.

451
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,540
How I feel.

452
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,540
How you make me feel.

453
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,020
But I can't.

454
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,530
Hell is going on with you?

455
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,860
We are not done talking about this.

456
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,090
That's impossible.

457
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,110
There was a murder last night.

458
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,540
These skin cells belong to the murderer,

459
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,200
but these cells are naive.

460
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,730
Stem cells that they can replicate

462
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,700
and become any cell the body needs.

463
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,110
They only come from babies.

464
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,060
This means your killer is what, a newborn?

465
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,300
You honestly think that someone wants to kill me?

466
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,160
Well, we're not sure, Mr. Stagg, but...

467
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,300
an event you were being honored at was robbed at gunpoint.

468
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,990
And your head of security was found murdered this morning.

469
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,090
I am a scientist and a philanthropist.

470
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,460
We're not often the targets of assassins.

471
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,820
Well... what about lawsuits?

472
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,840
You got about 20 of those pending against you.

473
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,970
It is a sad fact of life, Detective, that

474
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,400
when you earn a lot of money,

475
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,840
people who haven't think they can take yours.

476
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,930
People like this guy, for example?

477
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,350
Danton Black?

478
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,860
Danton Black.

480
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,830
You fired him. Now he's suing you.

481
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,830
Unfortunately, our working relationship wasn't successful,

482
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,050
but I can assure you both of one thing.

483
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,960
Danton Black...

484
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,980
is not a killer.

485
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,670
He's a clinical researcher, not a criminal mastermind.

486
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,210
Now, if I can help you in any way, please let me know.

487
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,170
I want these people caught as much as you.

488
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,420
Then here we are!

489
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,110
Down!

490
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,370
Captain, what's going on?

491
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,150
Not now, Barry.

492
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,370
An armed gunman is shooting up Stagg Industries.

493
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:05,810
Joe's there.

494
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,660
Get him out of here. I'll cover you.

495
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,820
Ready? Go.

496
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,470
Go!

497
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,450
No.

498
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,820
Whoever you are, give yourself up.

499
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,730
Sorry.

500
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,340
We are not going anywhere.

501
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,560
Until Simon Stagg is dead.

502
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,000
Sorry.

503
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,620
The abrasions are already rapidly healing.

504
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,780
Yeah, I got my ass handed to me.

505
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,410
You got blood on my suit.

506
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,020
I think some of it belongs to him.

507
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,960
Another not-so-friendly meta-human.

508
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,570
Danton Black.

509
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,480
He's a bio-geneticist specialized in therapeutic cloning.

510
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,430
Growing new organs to replace failing ones.

511
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,450
Apparently Stagg stole his research and then fired him.

512
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,650
I saw Black create duplicates from his own body.

513
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,840
That's pretty ironic.

514
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,230
The guy specialized in cloning

515
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,070
and now he can make xeroxes of himself.

516
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,500
If he was experimenting on himself

517
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,040
when he was exposed to the dark matter wave

518
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,040
released by the particle accelerator explosion--

519
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,060
Meet captain clone.

520
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,440
Don't worry. I'll come up with something cooler.

521
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,660
Where are you going?

522
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,670
Joe was right.

523
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,330
I'm in way over my head.

524
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,100
Yeah, I'm fast, but I am no warrior.

525
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,620
Man, I could barely fight one meta-human, let alone six.

526
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,870
Barry.

527
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,760
I understand.

528
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,440
Today was a setback.

529
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,780
But any grand enterprise has them.

530
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,800
And we can never learn to fly without crashing a few times.

531
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,520
This wasn't a grand enterprise, Dr. Wells.

532
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,560
This was a mistake.

533
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,150
Dad!

534
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,460
Sorry. No physical contact.

535
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,670
Five minutes, Allen.

536
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,330
Sit down, son.

537
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,000
Barry, how did you get here?

538
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,370
I ran here. Joe wouldn't bring me.

539
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,830
- He wouldn't let me see you. I hate him. - No, no.

540
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,170
Don't--don't say that.

541
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,410
It isn't Joe that doesn't want you to come here.

542
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,690
I don't want you to come here.

543
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,990
I don't want you to see me like this.

544
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,060
You have to let him go.

545
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,810
My dad didn't do these things.

546
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,300
He didn't hurt my mom.

547
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,660
It was the man in the lightning.

548
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,060
The lightning man killed my mom.

549
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,100
- Barry, look at me. - Not my dad.

550
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:09,990
Look at me.

551
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,620
You can't help me.

552
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Okay? Now Joe's gonna look after you until I can get out of here.

553
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,430
You just be the good boy that your mom and I know you are.

554
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,460
Dad?

555
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,790
Dad?

556
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,960
Detective, was the gunman apprehended?

557
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,300
The shooter's whereabouts are unknown at this time.

559
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,060
We consider him armed and extremely dangerous.

560
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,650
Thank you. No more questions.

561
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,810
Nice work, Eddie.

562
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,990
Nah. Right place, right time.

563
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,970
No, you were a hero today.

564
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,320
CCPD still has a killer on the loose.

565
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,400
I should get back to the precinct.

566
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,760
So did you come here for caffeine,

567
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,320
or are you finally gonna tell me what's going on with you?

568
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:35,550
Mr. Stagg,

569
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,160
I wish you would reconsider our offer for protective custody.

570
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,190
Danton Black has proven he is willing to kill,

571
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,630
and he's got... friends.

572
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,660
And trust me, they're all dangerous.

573
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,160
I've increased my security, detective.

574
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,750
I hope Black comes looking for trouble.

575
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,470
'Cause he'll find plenty.

576
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,440
Spoken like a true philanthropist.

577
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,750
or is it humanitarian?

578
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,470
I'm sorry. I can never remember

579
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,490
which one you're pretending to be, Simon.

580
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,640
Harrison...

581
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,260
Don't get up.

582
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,270
Another fan of yours, doctor?

583
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,780
Can we talk, detective?

584
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,720
So you were right.

585
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,570
Barry's not the only one who's special.

586
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,190
This guy that tried to kill Simon Stagg today, he could--

587
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,830
Replicate spontaneously.

588
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,290
Yeah, we know.

589
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,140
Did you know about Barry?

590
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,450
When he was first in his coma

591
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,480
you came to the hospital, and you asked me

592
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,360
if you could take him to S.T.A.R. Labs.

593
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,810
Did you know what he could do?

594
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,500
I had my suspicions that he was...

595
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,430
affected.

596
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,590
Hey, Joe...

597
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,000
I was never looking to become the senior member

598
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,700
of a secret crime fighting unit.

599
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,400
You and I both know

600
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,390
we are the only ones equipped to protect Central City.

601
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:08,090
Maybe I'm more interested in protecting Barry.

602
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,100
But of course he's all set to fly

603
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,600
into the fire right along with you.

604
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,570
No, he's not.

605
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,200
Not anymore. He quit.

606
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,210
He didn't tell you?

607
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
I haven't seen him.

608
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,060
Well I'm sure it's only temporary.

609
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,300
From what I know of Barry,

610
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,000
when he sets his mind to something...

611
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,500
No one's gonna talk him out of it.

612
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,130
But the next time he suits up...

613
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,540
runs headlong into danger...

614
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,680
he will fail.

615
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,050
Why?

616
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,320
He doesn't think he's capable.

617
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,000
Doubt...

618
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,830
is his real enemy.

619
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,430
Joe, not whatever's lurking out there.

620
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,360
And as long as you continue to doubt him,

621
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,000
he'll keep doubting himself.

622
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,980
And for the record...

623
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,240
I care about him, too.

624
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,640
Guess you were hungry.

625
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,420
Stress eating.

626
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,010
I came to say I'm sorry.

627
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,500
And you're right. I have been distant.

628
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,980
- Correct. - Kind of a jerk.

629
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,740
You should apologize more often.

630
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,780
You are really sensational at it.

631
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,150
So... what were you going to tell me the other day?

632
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,600
I thought I had to do something.

633
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,440
Something I thought was important,

634
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,250
but it turns out that I'm not very good at it.

635
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,690
But what I am good at is being your friend.

636
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,380
So if you need help coming up with

637
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,230
- a new topic for your article-- - I found one.

638
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,150
Something that actually interests me.

639
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,540
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

640
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,030
it's been all over the internet this week.

641
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,090
At a building fire...

642
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,250
at a bank heist...

643
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,680
even the other night when those robbers

645
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,700
shot at the security guard,

646
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,830
he said he was whooshed outside.

647
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,550
Something out there is saving people.

648
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,040
I thought you were taking journalism,

649
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,570
not science fiction writing.

650
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,150
Ever since I have known you

651
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,680
you have believed in the impossible.

652
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,830
What if you were right?

653
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,050
What if you were right about the night that your mom died?

655
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,570
Look, I told you I'm through.

656
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,830
I know, but you need to get to S.T.A.R. Labs

657
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,470
right now.

658
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,600
- Barry, it's okay. - It is not okay.

659
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,590
Black is here, and he's just... standing there.

660
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,130
That's not him, is it?

661
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,190
It's one of his replicates.

662
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,510
How did you get it?

663
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,710
I grew him.

664
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,930
I isolated a sample of Black's blood from you suit

665
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:45,400
to see if I could trigger the in vitro cultivation process

666
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,270
and learn how Black multiplies.

667
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,240
So I exposed the target cells to a protein gel,

668
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,800
and they began replicating...

669
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,740
into that.

670
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,970
Why isn't he...

671
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:56,110
it doing anything?

672
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,540
We did a brain scan.

673
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,040
Involuntary motor functions are active, little else.

674
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,410
We think it's acting as a receiver.

675
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,280
The clones are an empty shell without Black.

676
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,790
Shut down the real Black,

677
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,670
and you might shut them all down.

678
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,720
But how do we know which one's the real Danton Black?

679
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,940
That occurred to me given your own passing out.

680
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,710
Black has limits, just like you.

681
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,180
Controlling all of those clones

682
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,480
must require a tremendous amount of physical strength.

683
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,930
So, look for the one showing signs of weakness or fatigue.

684
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,310
He's the prime.

685
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,250
Just a theory...

686
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:26,470
but one you might want to put to the test, Mr. Allen.

687
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,050
Plus, I whipped up these high-calorie protein bars

688
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,010
for you to keep your metabolism up.

689
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,550
Any more of them?

690
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,570
Nope.

691
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,240
Why did it start moving?

692
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,650
The prime.

693
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,220
My guess is, the prime is on the move.

694
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,400
This one heard the summons to battle.

695
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,140
And I know where he was summoned to.

696
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,830
Stagg industries.

697
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,780
You should call it in.

698
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,680
Police can't fight this.

699
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,440
What Black's become, like Mardon...

700
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,720
beyond me.

701
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,570
Maybe way beyond them, too.

702
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,940
The only person it's not beyond

703
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,120
is you.

704
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,400
You gotta do this. I get it.

705
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,360
So for once in your life, do what I tell you to do.

706
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,070
Go stop him.

708
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,710
Just get me those figures by morning, okay?

709
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,930
Freeze. Don't move.

710
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,830
Hello, Danton.

711
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,470
Goodbye, Simon.

712
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,570
Stay here.

713
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,330
I know Stagg stole your research,

714
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,650
but that doesn't give you the right to murder.

715
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,170
You think this is about my job.

716
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,760
This is about Elizabeth.

717
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,370
She was my wife.

718
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,180
She had a degenerative coronary disease.

719
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,960
She'd been on the transplant list for years, but...

720
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,520
time was running out.

721
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,290
So if I couldn't get her a new heart...

722
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,940
You were gonna grow her one.

723
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,860
I was so close.

724
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,020
Until Stagg stole my research.

725
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,250
So he could reap the glory.

726
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,360
And I got to bury my best friend.

727
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,260
Now...

728
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,190
I'm alone.

729
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,060
Remember, Barry. Find the prime.

730
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,760
There's too many of them to fight.

731
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,290
Barry, you need to isolate the prime.

732
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,890
I can't. It's impossible.

733
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,870
Nothing's impossible, Barry. You taught me that.

734
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,200
You can do this.

735
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,000
Barry.

736
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,180
Barry, are you all right?

737
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,590
I'm fine.

738
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,140
I'm fine.

739
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,820
It's done.

740
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,480
Hang on!

741
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,440
No!

742
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,040
Don't.

743
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,440
Central city police officials are now confirming

744
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,040
- former employee Danton Black-- - Tried to save him.

745
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,350
Doesn't sound like he wanted to be saved.

746
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,900
Some people, when they break...

747
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,620
They can't be put together again.

748
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,530
Some people heal even stronger.

749
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,440
I hope so.

750
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:29,500
Well, at least Multiplex

751
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,480
won't be able to hurt anyone else.

752
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,090
Told you I'd come up with a cool name.

753
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,580
Yeah, I may be the one in the suit doing all the running...

754
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,780
but when I'm out there helping people,

755
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,810
making a difference...

756
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,190
you're all out there with me.

757
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,490
Finally realized something,

758
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,630
we were all struck by that lightning.

759
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,930
Hungry?

760
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,130
Pepperoni, olives... and jalapenos.

761
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,690
Just like you like it.

762
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,870
Thank you.

763
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,980
You were wrong.

764
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,320
I have been wrong a lot this week.

765
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,880
You're gonna have to be more specific.

766
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,080
You said that one of things driving you

767
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,850
to run around out there was that you couldn't help your dad.

768
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,830
You can help him.

769
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,910
We can.

770
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,130
We're gonna figure out

771
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,870
who or what killed your mother that night.

772
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,840
And then we're gonna get your father out of prison.

773
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,030
Together.

774
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,480
Joe, what I said about you not being my father--

775
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,730
Barry, I know.

776
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,150
I know I'm not your father.

777
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,120
You're right. You're not.

778
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,410
You're just... the man who kept me fed

779
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,800
and in clothes...

780
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,920
who sat beside my bed at night until I fell asleep

781
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,840
because I was afraid of the dark...

782
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,300
helped me with my homework...

783
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,950
you taught me how to drive and shave...

784
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,700
and you dropped me off at college.

785
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,340
Sounds a lot like a dad to me.

786
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,990
Every kid dreams of being a superhero.

787
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:59,120
Having powers. Saving people.

788
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,490
But no kid thinks about what it's like when you're a hero

789
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,050
and you're not saving people.

790
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,150
Truth is...

791
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,700
not much else changes.

792
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,960
You still hurt. You still love.

793
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,740
You still wish and hope and fear things.

795
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,510
And you still need people to help you with all of it.

796
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,390
In some ways, that's the best part.

797
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,840
Barry, an armored car was just hijacked on Griffin Avenue.

798
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,630
Get your ass over there.

799
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,130
I got it. Actually...

800
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,020
The best part?

801
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,810
It's this.

802
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,820
Wells...

803
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,860
Who the hell let you in here?

804
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,900
You been having a party out there?

805
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,970
I'm sure you saw on TV.

806
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,650
A former employee of mine tried to kill me.

807
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,340
Former employee with the ability to replicate...

808
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:57,900
faced off against a man who could move at super speed.

809
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,390
You've seen him too, haven't you?

810
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,460
Indeed, I have.

811
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,890
Extraordinary.

812
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,930
The power he possesses, it's like the--

813
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,120
it's like the gods of old.

814
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,260
it's like Mercury on earth.

815
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,500
Can you imagine if you could control his power?

816
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,970
If you could--if you could harness it?

817
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,620
You could change what it means to be human.

818
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,310
The man in a red mask is the key,

819
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,890
and I'm gonna get him.

820
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,270
The man in the red mask.

821
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,620
He's called the flash.

822
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,690
Or at least...

823
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,180
He will be one day.

824
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,990
What the hell?

825
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:47,180
Forgive me, Simon.

826
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,010
I worry you think that you will think this is personal,

827
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,260
and it's not.

828
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,030
It's just that the man in the red mask...

829
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,210
the fastest man alive...

830
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,690
he must be kept...

831
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,160
safe.
