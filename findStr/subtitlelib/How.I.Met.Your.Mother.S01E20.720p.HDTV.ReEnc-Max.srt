00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:18,551
<i>OLDER TED: Kids, about eight months...</i>

4
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:20,623
<i>into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's
engagement,</i>

5
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,484
<i>there occurred
a game-changing emergency.</i>

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,286
- Van Smoot is available.
- Oh, my God.

7
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:28,138
<i>OLDER TED: Van Smoot House
was a gorgeous mansion...</i>

8
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:29,382
<i>right on the Hudson River.</i>

9
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:32,060
<i>It had everything Marshall and Lily
wanted for their wedding,</i>

10
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:35,852
<i>but it was never available.
And then, suddenly, it was.</i>

11
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:38,020
There was a cancellation
two months from now.

12
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:40,316
You want to have our wedding
in two months?

13
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:41,814
No. It's impossible.

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,618
It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream.

15
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:48,093
No, there's just not enough time.
There's no...

16
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:49,400
Mini-vomit.

17
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:52,045
Okay, look, look, look.
I know that it's sudden, but check it.

18
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:55,106
If we don't take this, guess who's
on their way with a deposit check?

19
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:57,112
Todd and Valerie?

20
00:00:58,739 --> 00:00:59,983
<i>OLDER TED: When you're
planning a wedding,</i>

21
00:01:00,078 --> 00:01:01,672
<i>there's always one couple
with similar taste...</i>

22
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,840
<i>that seems to be one step ahead of you.</i>

23
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:06,696
<i>Todd and Valerie were that couple.</i>

24
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:11,688
We got to make a decision.
Todd and Valerie are in motion.

25
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,038
Van Smoot!

26
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:16,333
No! Kids, color!

27
00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:23,095
- Baby, pick me.
- Come on, come on, come on.

28
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,151
(ALL SCREAMING)

29
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,723
Hello, Marshall. Lily.

30
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:41,193
Todd. Valerie.

31
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,989
Stairs.

32
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:50,823
I can't believe it.
We got Van Smoot House.

33
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:56,199
It is on. It is on! Like the former
Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.

34
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:58,157
- What?
- You're a wonder.

35
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,229
Wow. You guys are getting married
in two months.

36
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:01,631
How are you going to get everything done?

37
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:04,882
Division of labor.
Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up.

38
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:08,469
Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.

39
00:02:09,249 --> 00:02:12,277
<i>OLDER TED: Robin had been mad at me
since the night I slightly exaggerated...</i>

40
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,795
<i>my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness.</i>

41
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:17,814
- Was it...
- It was your girlfriend.

42
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,215
You might want to call her back.

43
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,295
Or, actually, Robin,
why don't you go to the florist?

44
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:29,587
And, Ted, I could use your keen
architectural eye on the invitations.

45
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,443
Wow, that was really awkward, Lil.

46
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,103
And still.
It's still really awkward right now.

47
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,062
Hey, what about me? What's my job?
What do I get to do?

48
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:42,720
Okay, your job is very simple.

49
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:47,501
At the wedding, do not sleep with
anyone even remotely related to me.

50
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:49,507
(LAUGHS)

51
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:53,021
Lil, you know I can't promise that.

52
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:02,036
Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out.

53
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:07,037
Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.

54
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:10,060
Crap! Band! We forgot a band!

55
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:12,874
It's just gonna be silence
and then people chewing.

56
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,891
(SHUSHING)
Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!

57
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:18,548
- Who?
- The 88.

58
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:21,321
They're this awesome band.
They played my law review party.

59
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,126
They were found guilty.
On three counts of rocking.

60
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:26,262
Yeah, I saw them two months ago
at my cousin Bonzo's wedding.

61
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:27,314
They were great.

62
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,055
John 'Bonzo' Bonham from Led Zeppelin?

63
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:33,307
Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer
from Led Zeppelin who died in 1980,

64
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,595
got married two months ago.

65
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,012
Look, I can't sign off on a band
I've never even seen.

66
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:41,053
We don't even know
if they can play our song.

67
00:03:41,148 --> 00:03:43,571
They're going to have to
come over here and audition.

68
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:47,619
Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're like
The Wiggles of wedding bands.

69
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:49,988
Well, then I have to say no.

70
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:53,867
Baby, they're only holding the date
until Monday.

71
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:56,959
Well, are they playing
anywhere this weekend?

72
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:59,247
Let me check their website.

73
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,103
What?

74
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,525
Lily, you're being a wee bit intense
about this band thing.

75
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,783
Intense? I have a wedding to plan
in nine weeks for 200 people.

76
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,940
Even if a dinosaur
should poke his head out of my butt...

77
00:04:12,036 --> 00:04:13,662
and consume this coffee table,

78
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:17,087
- I need you to roll with it, okay?
- Wow.

79
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:20,941
Guys. I just tasted an amazing caterer.

80
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:24,341
- We already have a caterer.
- Oh, right. You're getting married.

81
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:26,466
You see what I did there?

82
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:31,287
It looks like The 88 are playing
at a high school prom...

83
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:33,169
in New Jersey tomorrow.

84
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:35,240
A prom? Can we go to that?

85
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:40,054
Yeah, we'll just call the high school,
they'll let us stand in the back and watch.

86
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,902
- Yeah. No, they won't.
- Why not?

87
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,783
'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.

88
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,217
No sweat, we'll just sneak in.

89
00:04:45,313 --> 00:04:47,258
We're not sneaking
into a high school prom.

90
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,138
Yes, we are. It's the only way.

91
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:50,668
You're getting on board with Barney's idea?

92
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:52,612
Man, you really have snapped.

93
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,003
It's nine weeks till the wedding.
At this point,

94
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:57,234
I'd say yes to just about anything.

95
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,240
- Well...
- No, Barney.

96
00:05:01,543 --> 00:05:04,731
<i>OLDER TED: And so, Aunt Lily
hatched the plan to crash a prom.</i>

97
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:06,357
- I'll go with you.
- Really?

98
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:07,887
Yeah, I never got to go to my prom.

99
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:10,309
We always had field hockey nationals
in the spring.

100

(FEIGNED COUGHING)

101
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:13,019
Lesbian.

102
00:05:13,114 --> 00:05:15,346
The cough is supposed to cover
the 'lesbian.'

103
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,820
No, I'm trying to start a thing
where the cough is separate.

104
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:21,530
Do you think we look young enough
to blend in at a high school?

105
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,367
Please, I'm ageless, Scherbatsky
just needs a good night's sleep,

106
00:05:24,463 --> 00:05:27,714
and you've got 'statutory'
written all over your body.

107
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:29,148
Hey, why don't we all go?

108
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:31,252
I don't know.
More people might be harder to sneak in.

109
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:33,579
We don't want to mess things up for Lily.

110
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:36,448
Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I
have been planning...

111
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,137
on having a guys' night out
before the wedding.

112
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,635
Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?

113
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,855
Sounds awesome. We should go out
and just get fricking weird.

114
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,970
- Yeah.
- 'Cause, you know,

115
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:45,373
you'd be a bad, bad man,

116
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:46,839
and I be an outlaw.

(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) What?

119
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:53,438
Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't
drive off no cliffs now, you hear?

120
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,444
Lame!

121
00:05:56,243 --> 00:06:00,952
But seriously, leave me a message,
and we'll meet up later.

122
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,155
All right, what do you think?

123
00:06:05,286 --> 00:06:06,880
Horrible.

124
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:09,621
You're gonna make such a great dad.

125
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:12,873
You look so classy and nice.
You're gonna stick out like a sore thumb.

126
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:15,072
Have you seen how the kids
are dressing these days,

127
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,462
with the Ashlee and the Lindsay
and the Paris?

128
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:21,542
They all dress like strippers.
It's go ho or go home.

129
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:24,156
Well, we have to get in.
I have to see this band,

130

'cause we have to
make a decision by Monday,

131
00:06:26,197 --> 00:06:27,886
'cause I'm getting married in 71 days,

132
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:29,033
and we still don't have...

133
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:31,998
(SHUSHING) Sweetie,
just focus on one thing at a time, okay?

134
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:35,026
Right now, you just have to dress
like a whore and that's it.

135
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:37,002
- All right.
- That's the spirit.

136
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:39,195
Now, ladies, slut up.

137
00:06:42,676 --> 00:06:48,606
I never thought this would be a bad thing,
but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.

138
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:51,949
- I didn't know I still had this.
- What?

139
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:55,496
The dress I wore to my actual prom.

141
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:05,054
Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom,
and not like in a corporate, plastic way.

142
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:08,551
Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul.

143
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:12,246
You look great, too, Scooter.

144
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:16,251
So, big news. I heard from umpire school.
I'm in!

145
00:07:16,656 --> 00:07:21,308
Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.

146
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:24,503
You mean happy for us, right, babe?

147
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:28,387
Scooter, you're gonna be
an umpire someday.

148
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:32,428
No, baby.
We're gonna be an umpire someday.

149
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:35,367
Nice.

150
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:38,523
Now, you ladies look good,
but your outfits are missing just one thing.

151
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:41,647
No, Barney, this is as far as we're going
to go. I'm not showing any more...

Hmm.

156
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:50,779
- Robin, are you tearing up?
- No.

157
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,555
- Robin, are you tearing up?
- No.

158
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:56,948
I've never been to prom before, okay?

159
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,083
- We got to go. See you.
- Bye, have fun.

- Bye.
- See you.

don't they, Ted?

162
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:07,467
- So, what, we ready for tonight?
- Yeah.

163
00:08:07,563 --> 00:08:08,774
Just one thing we got to do first.

164
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:09,826
Shot of Jim Beam?

165
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:10,973
- Yeah.
- Yes!

166
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,479

200 wedding invitations.

- I'm sorry, dude,

168
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,572
but you saw how stressed out she is.

169
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:20,567
Come on! You've been doing
wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break.

170
00:08:20,663 --> 00:08:22,162
Once you're married, if we go out,

171
00:08:22,257 --> 00:08:24,265
and you get so drunk
you throw up, it'll be sad,

172
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:27,103
but if we do it tonight, it'll be less sad.

173
00:08:27,671 --> 00:08:30,667
Okay, it'll be cool. I'll tell you what.
We'll make a game out of it.

174
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:34,173
First one to stuff 100 invitations
gets a big prize.

175
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,218
Do I look like I'm four?

176
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:39,147
All right, what kind of prize
are we taIking about?

178
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,939
Wow, a lot more security
than when we were kids.

179
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:44,501
- Is this gonna work?
- Yeah.

180
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:48,071
Look, when I was 17,
I used to sneak into clubs all the time.

181
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:51,171
It's all about confidence. Follow me.

I'm getting married in two months, and...

Hey, hey.

188
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:14,928
I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be
a student or the date of a student.

189
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:18,224
Wow.'Ma'am?' Check and mate.

Scherbatsky?

193
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:29,696
Hey, guys.
You want to take two hot girls to prom?

194
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:32,029
We don't have that kind of money.

195
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:34,320
- For free.
- Oh, hell yeah.

196
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:37,288
- Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.
- Hi.

197
00:09:37,383 --> 00:09:39,294
- Shall we?
- Sure.

198
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:43,664
I knew it would happen. This is the dream.

199
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,385
Hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?

200
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:48,242
Don't worry about me. I'll get in.

Yeah, what the hell? It's prom.

207
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:18,970
That tastes like cough syrup.

208
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:22,955
Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol.
Our fake IDs say we're only 20.

209
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,727
We didn't realize it till after we bought them.

Life's going to be rough, boys.

<i>I was wondering if you guys could
play Good Feelingby the Violent Femmes.</i>

I know it's probably not in your repertoire,

214
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:43,695
but I'm getting married and my fiancé
wants to hire you guys as the band,

<i>but I can't sign off on it

217
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:48,350
and what kind of wedding band
would you be...

218
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:51,091
if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?

219
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:55,139
Look, I'm kind of wasted right now,
so I didn't understand any of that.

220
00:10:55,235 --> 00:10:58,071
But if you get us the sheet music,
we'll play your song.

00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,124
Okay.

We should be out in a bar getting in fights.

Hey, if I got in a fight,

- Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame!

I don't even want to go, anyway.

Things have been so weird between us.

What'd she say? What'd she say?

243
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,573
He lied and told me he broke up
with his girlfriend...

244
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,294
to try to hook up with me.

245
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,725
I mean, I know he apologized for it
but it's just... It's not easy to forgive.

Well, look,
if you absolutely must bring Ted,

my own eyes out if he comes.

Okay, bye.

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,313
I just don't want everything
in my life to be decided already.

258
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:51,692
What's decided?
I go to umpire school, you go to college.

259
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:53,828
We move into my dad's house
in Staten Island.

that's the end for us.

There's still so much I want to do.

264
00:13:11,104 --> 00:13:14,758
I want to travel, live overseas as an artist,

265
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:17,658
maybe have a lesbian relationship.

266
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,707
Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause
you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.

267
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:24,713
I can't believe this.

268
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:27,648
I can change.
I can look more like Kurt Cobain.

Please, just don't leave me!
I'm nothing without you, baby.

of pressure on me! It's too much!

- What?

own video game company or something.

No, you won't accomplish anything
you set out to.

00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:59,785
Nice to meet you, Marshall.
Guess we're hall mates.

331
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,791
Yeah.

332
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:03,674
<i>(VIOLENTFEMMES PLAYING
GOOD FEELING)</i>

333
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,680
It works.

334
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:09,822
- Violent Femmes. I love this song.
- Me, too.

335
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,770
I didn't have any of the experiences
I set out to.

336
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:22,288
The travel, the bohemian art life,
my big lesbian experience.

337
00:17:22,736 --> 00:17:24,646
I didn't do any of it.

338
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,984
Lily, you're marrying
your best friend in the world.

339
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,870
I mean, isn't that worth
all the other experiences combined?

340
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:35,327
Yeah.

341
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,865
And, look, you can still travel.
I mean, you can still paint.

342
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:42,209
And as far as your lesbian experience...

343
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,609
- Happy?
- Yeah.

344
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:49,992
- So field hockey, huh?
- Shut up.

345
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:54,766
Trespassing, assaulting a minor.

346
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:58,150
And this mascot costume you stole
cost $5,000.

347
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,222
We can have you guys arrested,
you know that?

348
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:02,580
Oh, come on, you're the one who let in
a kid with nunchucks.

349
00:18:02,676 --> 00:18:05,322
You call yourself security guards?
I was just defending my boy here.

350
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,351
- I totally could have taken that kid.
- Yeah, and I totally had your back, so...

351
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:11,251
- Well, I didn't need it, but thanks.
- Yeah, you did, and you're welcome.

352
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:14,120
No, the kid was totally like
a white belt and I'm gigantic.

353
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:17,594
Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need
to get in there for one more song.

354
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,601
Absolutely not.

355
00:18:20,336 --> 00:18:23,651
You guys will thank me for this later, okay?

356
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:27,529
- Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...
- Hey!

357
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,874
You know, for a turtle,
he's surprisingly quick.

358
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:39,748
This one goes out to that redhead girl
and that tall guy.

359
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:42,224
<i>(PLAYINGGOOD FEELING)...</i>

360
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,885
- So, how was your first prom?
- You tell me.

361
00:19:05,981 --> 00:19:10,793
I hated my dress, my date got wasted
and puked on me, there was a huge fight,

362
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:12,800
and I kissed a girl.

363
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,874
So, basically, it was a prom.

364
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:16,755
(LAUGHS)

365
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,641
Okay, I've missed you.
Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way,

366
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:27,052
not even in an l-forgive-you way.
Just in an I've-missed-you way.

367
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:30,101
I'll take what I can get.

368
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:35,275
And that, my friends, is why
you don't get your money's worth...

369
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,294
when you wear jeans to a strip club.

370
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:44,136
So you got to admit,
The 88 are rocking our song.

371
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:46,142
Yeah, it's good.

372
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,374
Band. Check.

373
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:52,967
Two months, baby. Two months.

374
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:57,015
Two months.

375
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:06,546
Two months.
