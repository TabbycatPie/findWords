1
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,805
We're not doing any
exercises that you don't know. All right?

2
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:13,965
That's important.

3
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:15,925
So, we get
the central nervous system firing

4
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:18,805
in sort of a race intensity.
It's really high intensity.

5
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:21,525
<i>And then the lateral band walk,</i>

6
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,845
<i>we'll do that twice through.</i>

7
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:25,845
And then we'll go get in the sauna
and shower.

8
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:28,205
No cameras in this room, though.

9
00:00:29,205 --> 00:00:30,765
You don't want to see
what happens in there.

10
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,085
Let's go!

11
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:36,845
<i> I think motorsport has been</i>
<i>in my blood since I was a kid.</i>

12
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,085
Power. Up. Power.

13
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:42,085
<i>I was actually two years old</i>
<i>when I was given my first go-kart.</i>

14
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:45,205
Power, power, power, power!
Run! Run! Come on. Push, push, push.

15
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:48,125
My name is Carlos Sainz,
I drive for Renault Sport Formula One.

16
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:49,525
Faster feet. Come on.
Faster, faster, faster...

17
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:51,365
<i>Born in Madrid, Spain.</i>

18
00:00:51,445 --> 00:00:52,845
Smash it against the wall.
Come on.

19
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:54,965
<i>When I was nine years old,</i>

20
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:58,605
<i>I remember seeing Fernando Alonso</i>
<i>winning the World Championship.</i>

21
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:08,325
<i> In 2005, I meet Fernando Alonso</i>
<i>in the Spanish Grand Prix.</i>

22
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:11,925
<i>I remember going back home</i>
<i>and saying to my dad,</i>

23
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,885
"I want to be like Fernando Alonso.

24
00:01:13,965 --> 00:01:15,725
I want to be a Formula One driver."

25
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:20,485
<i>I hope one day I can add my name</i>
<i>to the list of Spanish drivers</i>

26
00:01:20,565 --> 00:01:22,405
<i>that have won a Formula One race.</i>

27
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:30,365
Fernando, who will win in
the championship between you and Carlos?

28
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:34,845
I think, uh, this is difficult to predict,

29
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:38,165
but, you know,
it depends of our teams a little bit.

30
00:01:38,245 --> 00:01:42,165
But, um, if I have to bet my money,

31
00:01:42,245 --> 00:01:44,805
I will put on McLaren and myself.

32
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:52,245
<i>What's happening to Carlos Sainz</i>
<i>in his battle with Fernando Alonso?</i>

33
00:01:54,885 --> 00:01:56,965
<i>Sainz has taken</i>
<i>the long way around, onto the gravel.</i>

34
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:59,365
<i>That's never gonna win out</i>
<i>that particular Spanish duel.</i>

35
00:02:01,245 --> 00:02:03,845
<i>Fernando Alonso is on his way home now!</i>

36
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:08,045
<i>Fifth place in this race</i>
<i>and what a performance that is!</i>

37
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:13,165
I think it was definitely a good race,

38
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:14,885
and we should be proud of that,
but yeah,

39
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,245
I think there is a lot more to come.

40
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:21,685
<i> Carlos Sainz now</i>
<i>puts Fernando Alonso under pressure...</i>

41
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:24,525
<i>Is he gonna try and launch one?</i>
<i>He is, down the inside!</i>

42
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:27,245
<i>Alonso saw him coming.</i>

43
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:38,085
<i>And there's Carlos Sainz.</i>

44
00:02:38,965 --> 00:02:42,885
<i>But Fernando Alonso got the inside line</i>
<i>and just cuts him off.</i>

45
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:53,485
<i>Fernando Alonso is my racing hero,</i>

46
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,405
<i>but I really wanna beat him,</i>

47
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:58,645
<i>because I've been losing against him.</i>

48
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:00,725
<i>I really want payback.</i>

49
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:36,685
<i>My view of McLaren</i>
<i>has always been</i>

50
00:03:36,765 --> 00:03:40,285
<i>that they are the best racing team</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

51
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:46,205
<i>When I got the call to work here,</i>
<i>it was extremely, uh, special.</i>

52
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:48,485
My name is Zak Brown.

53
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:51,165
I'm executive director
of McLaren Technology Group.

54
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:58,325
<i>I've been in motor racing my entire life.</i>
<i>I'm now 46 years old.</i>

55
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:01,245
<i>We have a lot to offer at McLaren.</i>

56
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,285
<i>We've been absolutely dominant</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

57
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,125
<i>And McLaren</i>
<i>have already broken</i>

58
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,965
<i>just about every record in the book.</i>

59
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:12,325
<i> To show up every day</i>
<i>and look down the boulevard,</i>

60
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:15,445
<i>and have the first thing you see</i>
<i>is Niki Lauda's car.</i>

61
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:21,205
<i>And Ayrton Senna's car.</i>

62
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:25,405
<i> Ayrton Senna crosses the line.</i>
<i>He is world champion.</i>

63
00:04:26,445 --> 00:04:29,645
<i>We've got thousands of employees</i>
<i>running around here</i>

64
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:33,085
<i>that all share</i>
<i>the same passion and desire to win.</i>

65
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:38,845
<i>We've got a massive fan base,</i>
<i>but it's been pretty hard to cheer for us</i>

66
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,965
<i>'cause we've not been anywhere near</i>
<i>racing at the front.</i>

67
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:45,165
You know, it's been
a difficult five-year run.

68
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:46,605
-Yeah, take that. Okay.
-Get rid of this...

69
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:48,765
'cause you're kind of shifting.
This is all drivers.

70
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:52,525
<i> I felt I could contribute</i>
<i>to making a difference.</i>

71
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:54,485
We do everything in dollars.

72
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:56,165
If you're happy for me to flip them
all to dollars...

73
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:58,405
-put that down on the last page.
-Flip 'em. Flip 'em all to dollars.

74
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,125
-Okay.
-Otherwise it starts becoming a bit...

75
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:02,645
<i>And so, I wanted</i>
<i>to get into an environment</i>

76
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:06,045
<i>that I had some work to do,</i>
<i>as opposed to maybe joining</i>

77
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,565
<i>a team that's on the top,</i>
<i>and you've got kind of only one way to go.</i>

78
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:31,765
<i> Winter testing is</i>
<i>the first opportunity that we get</i>

79
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:34,765
<i>to see the new cars for this year</i>
<i> out on track.</i>

80
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,005
<i>It's really a first opportunity</i>

81
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:39,685
<i>for the teams to put their cars</i>
<i>through their paces,</i>

82
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:43,365
to see if they're as good
as they hope they're gonna be,

83
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:45,605
if they're as fast as they hope
they're gonna be,

84
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:47,885
and crucially, if they are reliable.

85
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:53,245
<i>The stakes have really never been higher</i>
<i>for McLaren.</i>

86
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:59,645
<i>They are trying to rebuild themselves into</i>
<i>a competitive championship-winning team.</i>

87
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:05,165
After so many years of disappointment,
if they don't get it right this year,

88
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:07,085
they're gonna lose their driver.

89
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,005
I think Fernando is
one of the best drivers

90
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:14,605
in the history of Formula One.

91
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,605
<i>I don't think there is a team</i>
<i>that wouldn't love to have Fernando</i>

92
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:20,765
<i>in their racing car.</i>

93
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:24,125
<i>So, to have him stay with us, I think,</i>
<i>is a big vote of confidence</i>

94
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:27,165
<i>of how he feels we will race this year.</i>

95
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:33,525
My name is Fernando Alonso.

96
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:36,765
I am two times world champion
and I race for McLaren.

97
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:42,125
<i>I have a lot of power on the things</i>

98
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:45,885
<i>that I may say,</i>
<i>so I feel that responsibility,</i>

99
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:50,085
<i>that leadership, and I try to guide</i>
<i>the team in the best way possible.</i>

100
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:56,685
<i>I feel confident this year.</i>

101
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:59,125
<i>We wanna come out pretty strong</i>
<i>and demonstrate</i>

102
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:01,725
<i>that we're gonna be back</i>
<i>to our winning ways.</i>

103
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:04,045
<i>Radio check.</i>

104
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,725
<i> Okay, Fernando.</i>
<i>Yeah, that sounded clear for me.</i>

105
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:14,405
<i>Winter testing is always a moment</i>
<i>of the year where we are all optimistic.</i>

106
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:20,885
<i>We have a lot of trust</i>
<i>and faith on the car.</i>

107
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:28,645
<i>We try to stretch the car, you know,</i>
<i>to the maximum.</i>

108
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,285
<i>Okay, nice work, Fernando.</i>

109
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:42,965
I need multi-function C2,
position four, please.

110
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,325
<i> Yes, okay.</i>

111
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,325
<i>When I joined the team, we were</i>
<i>fighting for the world championship</i>

112
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:53,365
<i>and that was a different role</i>
<i>than what we have now,</i>

113
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:57,525
<i>which is trying to fight back and bring</i>
<i>the team back to the top positions.</i>

114
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:05,285
<i>Okay, Fernando,</i>
<i>this pace is really good.</i>

115
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:06,325
<i>Copy.</i>

116
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,085
- Alonso.
<i>-  It is Alonso!</i>

117
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,605
Alonso's had a crash. Well, he's gone off.

118
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:26,005
A wheel has come off his car.

119
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,565
<i>It's rare</i>
<i>this happens in testing.</i>

120
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:38,965
<i>It's better that it happens now than</i>
<i>it happens once you get to the first race.</i>

121
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:43,565
But it's... shall we say,
it's a worrying thing to happen?

122
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:49,765
Fernando's not gonna be happy.

123
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:02,365
<i>In Formula One, it's not easy</i>
<i>to hide anything in winter testing.</i>

124
00:09:05,285 --> 00:09:08,365
If we assume that it's like this
for the rest of the day...

125
00:09:09,045 --> 00:09:10,845
Then we go to another plan.

126
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:13,605
<i>So many people</i>
<i>and so many cameras.</i>

127
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:16,725
<i>There are a lot of eyes on everyone.</i>

128
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:18,645
Yeah.

129
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:22,885
We need to have this?
At this crucial moment?

130
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:24,205
I don't want to...

131
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:25,645
Go and handle it. Go.

132
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:53,565
<i>We are ready for a cracking</i>
<i>2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix.</i>

133
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:56,485
<i>The paddock is really</i>
<i>starting to come to life.</i>

134
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:58,405
I'm excited. Excited to be back here.

135
00:09:58,485 --> 00:10:00,765
Obviously, I'd love to win.
It should be a fun race.

136
00:10:01,245 --> 00:10:05,845
<i>The race that could just</i>
<i>conjure up anything in the next 51 laps.</i>

137
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:08,725
<i>And you can feel it,</i>
<i>the pressure in the air.</i>

138
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:14,525
Make sure to be
very clear in your analysis of the tires.

139
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:18,245
But it's better to have--
Even if one is the best,

140
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:21,325
it's better to have two optimized
than one that is...

141
00:10:21,405 --> 00:10:24,205
-One and a half?
-Yeah. Not-- Not half for a grand prix.

142
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,085
The electronics...

143
00:10:26,165 --> 00:10:28,725
<i>2018 has to be</i>
<i>a season where Renault</i>

144
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:30,325
<i>shows that we are progressing...</i>

145
00:10:31,085 --> 00:10:35,405
<i>and for our ambition to be fighting at</i>
<i>the top in a few years' time is credible.</i>

146
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:37,725
My name is Cyril Abiteboul.

147
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:40,125
I am Managing Director
of Renault Sport Formula One.

148
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:44,605
<i>But what's fantastic</i>
<i>is our line-up of drivers.</i>

149
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:51,205
<i>Carlos and Nico</i>
<i>is one of the strongest in the grid.</i>

150
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:59,125
-You won't make it...
-No, there was no turning back.

151
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:01,005
<i>The midfield is extremely tight.</i>

152
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:07,245
<i>McLaren, right now, uh...</i>
<i>they are our most direct competitor.</i>

153
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,245
<i>If we have the ability to beat them,</i>

154
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:12,685
<i>it will say a lot about</i>
<i>the progression of Renault.</i>

155
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,805
<i>We need to deliver</i>
<i>what people are expecting from us.</i>

156
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:20,605
<i>If I don't deliver... I'm fired.</i>

157
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,805
<i>There's always gonna be people</i>
<i>making mistakes in Baku.</i>

158
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,165
<i>For me, it's one of the most</i>
<i>challenging tracks</i>

159
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:40,765
<i>in Formula One at the moment.</i>

160
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:47,205
<i> And just a reminder about</i>
<i>the tailwinds in three, four, 15 and 16.</i>

161
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,405
<i> If you stay out of trouble,</i>

162
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,685
<i>you could actually think about</i>
<i>a top five finish.</i>

163
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:54,605
<i>Radio check.</i>

164
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,125
<i>Yeah, Fernando,</i>
<i>loud and clear for me.</i>

165
00:11:56,205 --> 00:11:59,645
<i>It is the fastest street circuit</i>
<i>in the world and you know</i>

166
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:02,885
<i>always that gives a lot of adrenaline</i>
<i>for the spectators.</i>

167
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:04,045
<i>And for drivers as well.</i>

168
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,085
<i>So the cars begin</i>
<i>the formation lap in Baku,</i>

169
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:10,285
<i>one more chance to warm their tires</i>
<i>and warm their brakes...</i>

170
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:19,805
<i>It's a very particular track,</i>
<i>because you've got the first sector</i>

171
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:22,805
<i>that is dominated</i>
<i>by ninety-degree corners.</i>

172
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:25,525
<i>If you talk to the drivers,</i>
<i>they'll tell you that it's like driving</i>

173
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:27,165
<i>very, very fast in a cage.</i>

174
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:32,245
<i>Then you've got sector two,</i>
<i>which is very twisty in the old town.</i>

175
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:33,885
<i>So, that's very different.</i>

176
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,765
<i>Sector three is pretty much</i>
<i>one corner and a straight.</i>

177
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:44,405
Okay, Fernando, five seconds to go.

178
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:02,125
<i> It's a dash down to turn one then,</i>
<i>who's gonna come out on top?</i>

179
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:05,205
<i>So far, all getting away cleanly.</i>

180
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:09,365
<i>And there's damage!</i>

181
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,525
<i>Wow, it's full of debris.</i>

182
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:16,965
<i> There's contact</i>
<i>down into turn two!</i>

183
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:21,125
<i>Fernando Alonso and Sirotkin</i>
<i>going wheel to wheel.</i>

184
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,045
<i>Oh, no!</i>
<i>There's contact for Fernando Alonso.</i>

185
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,965
<i>Puncture switch.</i>
<i>Puncture switch.</i>

186
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:31,565
<i>And Ocon in a collision.</i>

187
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,605
<i>Ocon is out of the race!</i>

188
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:43,085
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

189
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:47,285
<i>You take care in corner one, corner two,</i>
<i>and they crash into you.</i>

190
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:52,085
<i>Fucking stupid!</i>
<i>It's a black flag situation.</i>

191
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:55,445
<i>What this guy's been doing?</i>
<i>Destroy the complete race.</i>

192
00:13:56,925 --> 00:14:01,365
We had two punctures
and the car was nearly undriveable.

193
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:04,445
<i>Okay, I need to box.</i>

194
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:09,405
<i>It was not fair to have that damaged car</i>
<i>on lap one</i>

195
00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:11,765
<i>and not having the possibility</i>
<i>to fight back.</i>

196
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:18,405
<i>You know, that anger to go back</i>
<i>to the pit lane and change those tires--</i>

197
00:14:20,565 --> 00:14:23,805
<i>You know, the desire of "keep racing".</i>

198
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:28,645
<i>It was not the moment to retire that car.</i>

199
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:35,845
<i> I think most drivers</i>
<i>would have parked the car</i>

200
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,245
<i>and wouldn't have even thought</i>
<i>about continuing in the race.</i>

201
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:52,565
Okay, Fernando, the race isn't over
for us. The race isn't over.

202
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,965
Okay, Carlos, how is the balance?

203
00:15:06,045 --> 00:15:07,285
<i>Yeah, all good.</i>

204
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,725
<i>Here goes Carlos Sainz.</i>
<i>He's up in sixth place.</i>

205
00:15:12,285 --> 00:15:14,805
<i>Tries to go around the outside.</i>
<i>Nothing doing.</i>

206
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:18,605
<i>At that point in the race,</i>
<i>I really started attacking</i>

207
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,005
<i>and really pushing flat out.</i>

208
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,565
<i>Carlos Sainz. He's on Verstappen's tail.</i>

209
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:26,205
<i>Brilliant racing from all three drivers.</i>

210
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:32,725
<i>My name is Carlos Onoro,</i>
<i>I'm Carlos Sainz's manager and his cousin.</i>

211
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:38,485
<i>I mean, for me,</i>
<i>it's heart attack after heart attack.</i>

212
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:42,485
<i>Qualifying until the end of the race,</i>
<i>it's like a roller-coaster.</i>

213
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,165
<i>Carlos Sainz looking very racy...</i>

214
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,125
<i>And it means a lot</i>
<i>to be racing against Red Bull</i>

215
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:50,885
<i>and to be pressuring them.</i>

216
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,805
<i>In a race like Baku where you see</i>
<i>that he's fighting for fourth,</i>

217
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,965
<i>for fifth position, which is not normal,</i>
<i>it's always exciting.</i>

218
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,925
<i> Verstappen might go</i>
<i>down the inside. And he does so!</i>

219
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:05,605
A podium is always something
that you are aiming for.

220
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:08,485
<i>The difficulty is that there</i>
<i>are three top teams,</i>

221
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:11,085
two cars each.
That's already sixth position.

222
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,765
<i>That leaves little room for us,</i>
<i>but who knows?</i>

223
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:17,125
<i>Maybe there will be</i>
<i>that opportunity for us,</i>

224
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:20,285
<i>and we need to be sure to seize</i>
<i>that opportunity if it's given.</i>

225
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:25,045
<i>Sainz swoops</i>
<i>round the outside of Verstappen.</i>

226
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,085
<i>Nice move there</i>
<i>from the driver in the Renault.</i>

227
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:34,645
<i>Tires are super soft.</i>

228
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:37,085
<i>I'm starting to degrade a bit</i>
<i>at the rear tires.</i>

229
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:40,005
<i>I'm going to start losing time</i>
<i>with the Red Bulls.</i>

230
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:42,005
Okay, so, box this lap.
Box this lap.

231
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,205
<i>Coming.</i>

232
00:16:43,765 --> 00:16:47,725
<i>Carlos Sainz into the pits, then.</i>
<i>He's had to let the Red Bulls go.</i>

233
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,605
<i> The Red Bulls had pulled away.</i>

234
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:09,045
<i>They were ten, fifteen seconds ahead of me</i>
<i>and they were both fighting each other.</i>

235
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,125
<i>Ricciardo desperate</i>
<i>to get past Max Verstappen.</i>

236
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:15,565
<i>But Verstappen aggressively defending</i>
<i>against his teammate.</i>

237
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,965
- <i> Yellow flags turn one. Take care.</i>
<i>- Yellow turn one.</i>

238
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:40,765
- <i>Debris at turn one.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Double yellow at turn one.</i>

239
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,165
<i>Both Red Bulls off at turn one.</i>

240
00:17:50,165 --> 00:17:52,725
That's 25, 30 points
we just fucked away there.

241
00:17:56,525 --> 00:17:59,525
<i>When you are driving for one</i>
<i>of the teams in the midfield,</i>

242
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,965
<i>I'm not gonna say I would celebrate</i>
<i>the top team's crashing into each other,</i>

243
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:08,445
<i>but if Carlos goes up two places</i>
<i>because the drivers decide to collide,</i>

244
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:11,405
<i>it's good for him,</i>
<i>and he gained two places for free.</i>

245
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:16,925
<i>Safety car. Safety car.</i>
<i>Safety car in this lap.</i>

246
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:19,605
<i>Okay, which position am I?</i>

247
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:21,325
<i>You're currently P-7.</i>

248
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:22,525
<i>Okay.</i>

249
00:18:24,245 --> 00:18:26,685
Now we've got--
I don't know how many laps to go,

250
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:31,285
but not many until the end,
so... new tires.

251
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:33,245
We need to overtake Grosjean.

252
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,205
<i>Right, onboard then with Grosjean.</i>

253
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:38,845
<i>He's weaving around, trying to get</i>
<i>temperature into the tires...</i>

254
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:41,445
<i>And he's gone and crashed!</i>

255
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,925
Oh! Ooh. There you go.

256
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:49,125
<i>Okay, Grosjean crashed.</i>
<i>Nice one. P-6.</i>

257
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,005
Safety car...

258
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:00,365
I'm fucking speechless.

259
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,125
I cannot fucking believe it.

260
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:08,285
That's how quick things can change
in Formula One.

261
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,485
Ouch.

262
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,885
<i>Back with Fernando Alonso.</i>

263
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,405
<i>Fernando, you're doing</i>
<i>an amazing job. This pace is really good.</i>

264
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:19,845
<i> Okay.</i>

265
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,205
<i>Okay, guys,</i>
<i>how many laps to the end are we now?</i>

266
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,525
<i>Seven laps remaining now.</i>

267
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:29,165
<i>You're gaining four-tenths per lap</i>
<i>to the cars ahead.</i>

268
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:32,285
<i>- Keep focus.</i>
<i>-  Copy.</i>

269
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,085
<i>There's a puncture</i>
<i>for Valtteri Bottas!</i>

270
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:38,685
<i>It's a flat!</i>
<i>He ran across some debris.</i>

271
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:39,605
Oh!

272
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,605
Ah, tire failure!

273
00:19:45,445 --> 00:19:47,605
<i>At that point, I remember thinking</i>

274
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:49,725
<i>about giving it a shot</i>
<i>at that podium place.</i>

275
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,205
Let's go, Carlos.

276
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,365
Let's go, let's go.

277
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:03,925
<i>We have two laps remaining now.</i>

278
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:04,845
<i> Copy.</i>

279
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,205
<i> Sainz has pulled out</i>
<i>from behind the slipstream.</i>

280
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:12,365
<i>Nice move, there.</i>
<i>And he's now up into fifth place.</i>

281
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:17,165
<i>Nice job, Carlos. We need</i>
<i>to focus on the last lap. The last lap.</i>

282
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:18,325
<i>Copy.</i>

283
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,805
<i>Hamilton takes the checkered flag</i>

284
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:31,085
<i>and Carlos Sainz comes home</i>
<i>to finish in fifth.</i>

285
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:38,445
<i>That means Fernando Alonso finishes</i>
<i>as the second Spaniard in this race.</i>

286
00:20:39,245 --> 00:20:42,685
- <i>Nice job, mate. P-5, well done.</i>
<i>- Good job, guys.</i>

287
00:20:44,005 --> 00:20:48,165
<i>Following his earlier incident,</i>
<i>it's amazing Alonso finished at all.</i>

288
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:51,925
<i>Only a driver of his caliber</i>
<i>could've gotten that car to the end.</i>

289
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:58,205
Well, you feel proud of your team,
of your, um, abilities also,

290
00:20:58,285 --> 00:21:01,365
driving that car,
of your commitment.

291
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:07,245
You ended up with a P-7 and you feel,
very, very proud of that drive.

292
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:11,725
<i>It was, by far, the best race</i>
<i>of the season for me, personally.</i>

293
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:15,845
<i>Despite the start, we will fight</i>
<i>until the checkered flag.</i>

294
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,205
-You did great. Podium next.
-Yeah.

295
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:23,285
<i>Finishing fifth</i>
<i>was the best team result</i>

296
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,285
<i>since we returned to Formula One.</i>

297
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:29,965
<i>But we are still behind McLaren</i>
<i>in terms of the championship.</i>

298
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:32,525
-Well done, mate. Nice drive.
-Thank you.

299
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:35,365
<i>It was one of those weekends</i>
<i>that you go back home really happy</i>

300
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:38,325
<i>because you've contributed</i>
<i>to a very big team result.</i>

301
00:21:38,405 --> 00:21:41,925
Yeah, really good.
The Red Bulls were all over the place.

302
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:43,845
Thank you.

303
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:46,125
You guys must have been enjoying it
from the outside.

304
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,365
Yeah, we did. Yeah, yeah.

305
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:49,565
LeClerc got
a very good slipstream from me.

306
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:51,325
But then I got him back easily.

307
00:21:51,405 --> 00:21:54,085
I said, "This guy is not beating me.
No fucking way."

308
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:57,925
I went-- I went bananas to him like...

309
00:21:58,645 --> 00:22:02,765
<i>Azerbaijan Automobile</i>
<i>Federation. Well done, gentlemen.</i>

310
00:22:15,765 --> 00:22:18,085
No, no, no. Come on!

311
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:19,165
No, no.

312
00:22:21,765 --> 00:22:23,085
<i>Every time I'm in Spain,</i>

313
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:25,085
<i>I try to organize a dinner at home.</i>

314
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:27,005
How badly they’re playing!

315
00:22:27,085 --> 00:22:29,685
<i>You get</i>
<i>to disconnect a bit from the races</i>

316
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,365
<i>and you really get to have fun.</i>

317
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:32,765
That's a foul!

318
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,965
Don't let him go. Of course.
I love it.

319
00:22:37,525 --> 00:22:41,165
<i>Carlos, he's</i>
<i>my younger cousin, so we are very close.</i>

320
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:44,125
<i>We've been very close</i>
<i>since he was born, basically.</i>

321
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:47,725
- Hey! Fuck off, man!
- I can't believe it.

322
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,965
No shit. What a shitty pass, Marcelo.

323
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:52,645
<i>His father is my uncle.</i>

324
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:58,325
<i>Even if you haven't heard</i>
<i>about Carlos Sainz, the motorsport legend,</i>

325
00:22:58,405 --> 00:23:01,965
<i>when you meet him,</i>
<i>you can tell he's a powerful guy.</i>

326
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:06,245
- Damn it! Come on man!
- Come on please!

327
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:10,925
Look! Cheat, cheat! Damn!

328
00:23:11,005 --> 00:23:14,285
<i>And obviously,</i>
<i>if you know something about sports,</i>

329
00:23:14,365 --> 00:23:16,925
<i>Carlos's father is an icon of motor sport.</i>

330
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:25,165
<i>For Carlos Junior, growing up with his dad</i>
<i>has had positives and negatives.</i>

331
00:23:25,245 --> 00:23:29,525
<i>You've got free advice from a legend.</i>

332
00:23:29,605 --> 00:23:31,645
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>I think it was a little bit tough</i>

333
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:34,285
<i>because everywhere</i>
<i>that Carlos went racing,</i>

334
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:38,325
<i>he was, like, pointed out that,</i>
<i>"Look, that's the son of Carlos Sainz.</i>

335
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:39,725
<i>I wanna beat that guy."</i>

336
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:45,205
<i>That kind of jealousy,</i>
<i>he has had to prove a lot of people wrong.</i>

337
00:23:56,045 --> 00:24:01,365
<i>If I could be invisible,</i>
<i>I would love to be invisible.</i>

338
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:07,005
- How's it going?
- Good.

339
00:24:08,005 --> 00:24:10,685
<i>This is his life, his sport, his time.</i>

340
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:16,005
<i>I have been enough time in the camera,</i>
<i>so I'm quite happy to leave him alone.</i>

341
00:24:17,485 --> 00:24:20,605
<i>Obviously, I know that my dad</i>
<i>is a very famous name.</i>

342
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:27,325
<i>I'm incredibly proud to be his son,</i>
<i>but me, personally,</i>

343
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:30,565
<i>I want to create my own name,</i>
<i>my own career in Formula One.</i>

344
00:24:34,965 --> 00:24:38,045
<i> Carlos is still growing,</i>
<i>he's still maturing, somehow,</i>

345
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:42,045
<i>and I remember</i>
<i>how I was with 22, 23.</i>

346
00:24:42,605 --> 00:24:46,285
<i>He's quite smart... sometimes.</i>

347
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:48,725
Ollie!

348
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:51,405
Aw! Look at this!

349
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:55,965
This is not a dog.
This is... a piece of shit!

350
00:25:07,845 --> 00:25:09,085
Carlos!

351
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:22,405
Everyone, the F1 world champion.

352
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:25,565
Give a big hand to Fernando Alonso!

353
00:25:27,605 --> 00:25:29,765
Fernando Alonso!

354
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:33,725
Hi, everyone. Well, the truth is…

355
00:25:35,005 --> 00:25:37,685
<i>It is emotional</i>
<i>racing in Spain for me.</i>

356
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:41,605
<i>You know, it is once a year</i>
<i>that you have the home Grand Prix.</i>

357
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:44,125
Please do not push.

358
00:25:44,205 --> 00:25:47,245
For safety reasons,
please do not push, <i>por favor.</i>

359
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:52,085
<i>You know, the amount of work</i>
<i>you put off track to make people happy,</i>

360
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:55,165
<i>to sign as many autographs as possible,</i>

361
00:25:55,245 --> 00:25:59,125
<i>to take time for the kids,</i>
<i>to take pictures,</i>

362
00:25:59,205 --> 00:26:01,765
<i>to give presents, you know,</i>

363
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:05,365
<i>whatever you can do to make people happy,</i>
<i>you try to do it that weekend.</i>

364
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:06,765
Fernando!

365
00:26:15,485 --> 00:26:18,965
They want us to do a lap in these ones,
but we cannot fit in the seats. Too small.

366
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:23,085
Yeah, it is a bit.
I've not been go-karting in fucking years.

367
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,965
- Yeah?
- I'm too old.

368
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:26,125
Still fun. Still good fun.

369
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:27,885
Yeah, I haven't done it for so long.

370
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:30,525
<i> Karting has been, for me,</i>

371
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:33,365
<i>probably the best part</i>
<i>of my racing career.</i>

372
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:36,685
<i>I've been in go-karts</i>
<i>for more than 15 years</i>

373
00:26:36,765 --> 00:26:41,645
<i>and probably the best memories</i>
<i>are coming from that part of my life.</i>

374
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:44,765
Yeah. None?

375
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:47,765
To hold on, it's hard. So hard.

376
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:49,805
You ahve to go little by little.

377
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:50,965
We can't overtake?

378
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:54,005
You can't, no.
It's just an exhibition today.

379
00:26:54,085 --> 00:26:56,125
But you overtake.

380
00:26:56,205 --> 00:26:57,765
Today is just an exhibition.

381
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:00,965
Today we came here
to see you taking it easy.

382
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:04,085
<i>When you start racing</i>

383
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:06,725
<i>and you jump in a go-kart</i>
<i>for the first time...</i>

384
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:12,085
<i>um, there is some kind of, uh, freedom.</i>

385
00:27:16,365 --> 00:27:18,925
<i>As a kid, you normally follow your parents</i>

386
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:21,565
<i>and your friends</i>
<i>and your teacher at the school.</i>

387
00:27:21,645 --> 00:27:25,765
<i>Everything is always</i>
<i>behind, uh, some rules.</i>

388
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,965
<i>The first time you are behind the wheel,</i>

389
00:27:29,045 --> 00:27:32,725
<i>you are yourself and you are alone</i>
<i>on the race track.</i>

390
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:38,725
<i>That feeling, I think, together</i>
<i>with the speed and with the adrenaline,</i>

391
00:27:38,805 --> 00:27:41,965
<i>is something</i>
<i>that is difficult not to fall in love.</i>

392
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:05,565
<i>My dad comes nearly to every race,</i>
<i>maybe 16, 17 races a year out of 21.</i>

393
00:28:06,645 --> 00:28:11,245
<i>My sisters and my mom told me</i>
<i>that he gets a bit too nervous</i>

394
00:28:11,325 --> 00:28:13,845
<i>if he doesn't come</i>
<i>to a Grand Prix weekend.</i>

395
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,605
Come on!

396
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:24,685
I reckon Grosjean's not coming
around turn one.

397
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:27,485
What do you reckon?

398
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:32,045
- He might make one, but two...
- Okay, yeah.

399
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,845
<i>In the midfield,</i>
<i>all Spanish eyes</i>

400
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:37,205
<i>will be looking</i>
<i>at  Fernando Alonso in the McLaren</i>

401
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:39,285
<i>and Carlos Sainz in the Renault.</i>

402
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:44,365
<i>Alonso's in eighth, just one place</i>
<i>ahead of his fellow Spaniard.</i>

403
00:28:49,045 --> 00:28:50,765
Just do what we agreed.

404
00:28:51,325 --> 00:28:53,725
<i>I am a competitive guy.</i>

405
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:56,165
<i>I always visualize winning.</i>

406
00:28:58,885 --> 00:29:03,365
<i>That guy who was your hero,</i>
<i>your killer instinct immediately comes in</i>

407
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:07,085
<i>and you suddenly take it</i>
<i>as one rival more that you want to beat.</i>

408
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:12,285
<i>When you are on the grid,</i>
<i>you go into that zone,</i>

409
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:15,685
into that moment of,
"this is just a car and yourself."

410
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:21,125
<i>Compete, race, win.</i>
<i>You just need to deliver.</i>

411
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:24,285
<i>- </i><i>And radio check, Carlos.</i>
<i>- Yeah, all good.</i>

412
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:27,205
<i>There is</i>
<i>only one guy who's allowed</i>

413
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:30,445
<i>to talk to the driver</i>
<i>when he's out there on track.</i>

414
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:34,325
<i>It's a race engineer,</i>
<i>and for Carlos, it's Karel.</i>

415
00:29:36,365 --> 00:29:38,085
<i> Okay, Carlos. Good luck, mate.</i>

416
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:48,005
<i>Last car approaching the grid.</i>

417
00:29:57,485 --> 00:29:59,965
<i>And it's a good start</i>
<i>for Carlos Sainz.</i>

418
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:01,525
Let's go.

419
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:04,405
<i>Can he keep</i>
<i>ahead of Alonso into turn one?</i>

420
00:30:08,525 --> 00:30:10,085
<i>Oh, he just manages it.</i>

421
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:14,965
<i>But he's out wide and in the gravel.</i>
<i>That's Alonso's chance</i>

422
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:17,645
<i>to go out round the outside,</i>
<i>he's in trouble too.</i>

423
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:19,805
<i>And off is Grosjean!</i>

424
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,885
<i> Massive accident.</i>

425
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,725
<i>That looks like Romain Grosjean</i>
<i>very much out of this race.</i>

426
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,525
<i>Oh, and there's a Renault</i>
<i>involved as well.</i>

427
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:43,885
<i>Is that Carlos Sainz? I think it is.</i>

428
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,285
-Is that Carlos?
-Shit!

429
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:56,765
<i>No, that looks like</i>
<i>Nico Hülkenberg.</i>

430
00:30:56,845 --> 00:30:59,005
<i>Hülkenberg is out of this race.</i>

431
00:30:59,485 --> 00:31:00,525
That's Hülkenberg!

432
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,325
<i>It was Grosjean.</i>

433
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:05,485
<i>Exactly why I said at the beginning,</i>
<i>I said he's not coming around turn one.</i>

434
00:31:09,085 --> 00:31:12,925
<i>We can get racing once again.</i>
<i>Sainz is up in eighth place.</i>

435
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,205
<i> And Sainz is pressuring</i>
<i>Magnussen for seventh.</i>

436
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:17,605
<i>Tries to go around the outside</i>
<i>at turn three.</i>

437
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:19,925
<i>Not gonna get through there.</i>
<i>Down into eleventh.</i>

438
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:23,805
<i>And here's Alonso in eleventh. He's now</i>
<i>trying to attack Ocon in the same way</i>

439
00:31:23,885 --> 00:31:25,805
<i>and he is going to go around the outside.</i>

440
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:28,045
<i>He's still got it, hasn't he?</i>
<i>What a move!</i>

441
00:31:29,885 --> 00:31:31,285
Okay, Carlos, so box this lap.

442
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:34,285
<i> Coming in, Carlos, pit lane.</i>

443
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:37,485
<i>So you will be close</i>
<i>to Ericsson on pit exit.</i>

444
00:31:37,565 --> 00:31:38,485
<i>Okay.</i>

445
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:50,045
<i>Alonso's caught Hartley</i>
<i>on the straight. And he's got him.</i>

446
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:55,525
<i>Sainz is going for it here</i>
<i>with Marcus Ericsson.</i>

447
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:58,165
<i>Trying to go around the outside.</i>
<i>Ericsson just leans on him.</i>

448
00:31:58,245 --> 00:31:59,965
<i>Oh, they're gonna touch,</i>
<i>aren't they?</i>

449
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,845
<i>That is some great</i>
<i>side-by-side action.</i>

450
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:03,245
<i>Unbelievably close.</i>

451
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:05,245
<i>He has to look after his tires.</i>

452
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:06,965
<i>Our race isn't with Ericsson, mate.</i>

453
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:10,085
<i>Sainz is desperate</i>
<i>to overtake Ericsson.</i>

454
00:32:10,165 --> 00:32:11,965
<i>But Ericsson is long overdue a pit stop.</i>

455
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:16,045
<i>Don't forget, these tires need to last</i>
<i>Sainz until the end of the Grand Prix.</i>

456
00:32:16,205 --> 00:32:19,805
<i>Why I cannot pass?</i>
<i>He's too fast on the straight.</i>

457
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:21,205
<i> Keep him calm. Keep him calm.</i>

458
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:22,445
<i>He doesn't need to pass.</i>

459
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,405
<i>And it's the cars behind</i>
<i>he needs to worry about.</i>

460
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,405
<i>Does he know that's</i>
<i>LeClerc and Alonso behind him?</i>

461
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:33,925
Okay, Carlos,
behind you have LeClerc and Alonso.

462
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,565
<i>Let's stay calm.</i>
<i>We need to focus on tires.</i>

463
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:38,805
<i>Copy.</i>

464
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:42,085
<i>In the race, you go into</i>
<i>that more aggressive mode.</i>

465
00:32:42,165 --> 00:32:43,805
<i>You know that you are</i>
<i>in your home Grand Prix</i>

466
00:32:43,885 --> 00:32:45,485
<i>and you know that you need to make moves</i>

467
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:48,765
<i>to try and gain positions,</i>
<i>to try and put on a good show.</i>

468
00:32:48,845 --> 00:32:51,845
<i>His race is with LeClerc</i>
<i>and Alonso behind, not Ericsson.</i>

469
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:53,325
<i>That's what I just told him.</i>

470
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,125
<i> Well, tell him again,</i>
<i>and tell him to drop back</i>

471
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:57,645
<i>and stop fucking racing him. Please.</i>

472
00:32:58,245 --> 00:33:00,165
<i>If you won't tell him, I will tell him.</i>

473
00:33:00,245 --> 00:33:03,125
<i>He's going to wear his fronts out,</i>
<i>and we're gonna lose this race.</i>

474
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:07,885
<i> Look after the tires</i>
<i>and bring it home, please.</i>

475
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,925
<i>Marcus Ericsson is finally</i>
<i>off to the pits,</i>

476
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:14,605
<i>unleashing Sainz into seventh place.</i>

477
00:33:14,685 --> 00:33:18,405
<i>But just behind is Charles LeClerc,</i>
<i>who's getting passed by Fernando Alonso.</i>

478
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:20,365
<i>Alonso in eighth now.</i>

479
00:33:23,445 --> 00:33:25,725
<i>Next car behind you now</i>
<i>is Alonso.</i>

480
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:28,485
<i>Six laps to go.</i>

481
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:31,365
<i>We just had quite a pressure drop</i>
<i>through turn three.</i>

482
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,725
<i>When you say "drop,"</i>
<i>you mean a little tiny, wincey one</i>

483
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:36,805
<i>or something to be scared of?</i>

484
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:39,125
<i>Quite scared, yeah.</i>
<i>We were down to around two bar.</i>

485
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:40,045
<i>Okay.</i>

486
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:44,525
<i>Oh, the engine, engine.</i>

487
00:33:45,925 --> 00:33:48,525
- <i>It's fuel pressure.</i>
<i>- I had a fuel drop-out.</i>

488
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:50,445
<i>Turn the engine up, please, Karel.</i>

489
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:52,285
<i>Scenario one, scenario one.</i>

490
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,965
<i> Sainz has engine trouble.</i>
<i>He'll be down on power</i>

491
00:33:56,045 --> 00:33:57,245
<i>for these final few laps.</i>

492
00:33:58,485 --> 00:33:59,445
Broken?

493
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:03,405
I cannot believe it,
we were so close to the end.

494
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:08,205
<i>Carlos Sainz has Fernando Alonso</i>
<i>breathing down his neck.</i>

495
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:10,885
<i>Right, what can we do</i>
<i>through three?</i>

496
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,405
<i>We can go a little bit easier</i>
<i>through three</i>

497
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:14,365
<i>- so we don't get those drop-outs?</i>
<i>-  I'll suggest that.</i>

498
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:16,005
<i>It will help,</i>
<i>but it probably won't stop it.</i>

499
00:34:16,085 --> 00:34:18,885
<i>Okay, Carlos, we need to take it easy</i>
<i>through turn three.</i>

500
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:21,005
<i>How easy? Like, how much?</i>

501
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:22,365
<i>We need a big lift-off.</i>

502
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:26,245
<i>Like that is good.</i>
<i>Like that is very good.</i>

503
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:27,925
<i>Okay, keep doing that, please.</i>

504
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:30,925
<i>Alonso is eight seconds behind,</i>
<i>eight seconds behind.</i>

505
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:33,085
<i>So, I really needed to slow down,</i>

506
00:34:33,165 --> 00:34:36,005
<i>but at the same time,</i>
<i>I had Fernando pushing behind me.</i>

507
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:38,205
<i>Okay, Fernando,</i>
<i>Sainz is slowing.</i>

508
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:41,485
<i>Now I want 100% focus on Sainz.</i>

509
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:43,165
<i>Okay.</i>

510
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:49,165
He said, "Engine, engine."
He has to take the third turn very slowly.

511
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:51,205
You'll see how Fernando
pushes now.

512
00:34:51,685 --> 00:34:54,965
<i>Fernando Alonso has just put in</i>
<i>his fastest lap of the race.</i>

513
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:57,605
<i>Okay, Carlos, five laps to go.</i>

514
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,285
<i>I asked to my engineer</i>

515
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:01,405
<i>to keep telling me</i>
<i>the lap times of Fernando.</i>

516
00:35:01,485 --> 00:35:05,405
<i> Okay, two laps to go,</i>
<i>and a five-second gap to Alonso behind.</i>

517
00:35:10,965 --> 00:35:14,205
<i>Fernando, last lap</i>
<i>you were two seconds quicker than Sainz.</i>

518
00:35:14,285 --> 00:35:16,845
- One lap left, right?
- One lap.

519
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:20,325
<i>Alonso</i>
<i>is continuing to gain on Sainz.</i>

520
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,285
<i>This is the last lap.</i>

521
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,965
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>if we were gonna make it.</i>

522
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:30,285
There it is, come on.

523
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:40,005
<i>And there's Carlos Sainz!</i>

524
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:43,805
<i>And the Renault does it!</i>

525
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:48,085
<i>Finishing seventh in front</i>
<i>of McLaren's Fernando Alonso.</i>

526
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:51,325
What a relief.

527
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:55,165
Look where Fernando had him already.
Up to his neck.

528
00:35:56,045 --> 00:35:58,565
<i>Nice job, mate, P-7, P-7.</i>
<i>Well done.</i>

529
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:02,485
<i>Good job, Carlos. We beat McLaren.</i>

530
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:09,005
Ah, when he opened the radio and went,
"Engine, engine, engine,"

531
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:10,965
-it's like, "No fucking way."
-I know.

532
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:12,685
Great to get ahead of Alonso at the start.

533
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:17,645
And McLaren. We've overtook them
in the championship.

534
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,045
<i>We had some high hopes.</i>

535
00:36:20,885 --> 00:36:23,805
<i>I think we are the underdogs now.</i>

536
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:27,085
<i>It's not a place McLaren is used to being.</i>

537
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:29,605
So, we dropped one point behind Renault.

538
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:35,725
<i>It's a very decent finish for us.</i>

539
00:36:36,565 --> 00:36:41,085
<i>I think we have a team that is definitely,</i>
<i>finally starting to believe.</i>

540
00:36:44,525 --> 00:36:45,845
<i>Fernando was, you know,</i>

541
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:49,685
<i>the first world champion</i>
<i>in Formula One for Spain.</i>

542
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:57,485
<i>Carlos has a great respect for him.</i>
<i>You know, he's competing with his hero.</i>

543
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:00,525
<i> Good job, guys. Good job.</i>

544
00:37:02,205 --> 00:37:05,205
<i>Fernando is the best driver</i>
<i>in motor sport at the moment.</i>

545
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:08,845
So, I know I'm fighting against the best,
even if it's for P-7.

546
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:16,165
<i>Obviously, Fernando and Carlos</i>
<i>are a different generation.</i>

547
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:21,685
<i>Carlos knows he's the next Spanish driver</i>
<i>in Formula One,</i>

548
00:37:21,765 --> 00:37:24,005
<i>but he wants to do things his own way.</i>

549
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,085
It's incredible, no? How life is?

550
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,005
You know, when I met him when I was ten,

551
00:37:30,085 --> 00:37:33,205
<i>who would've told me that,</i>
<i>14 years later,</i>

552
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,045
<i>I would've ended up</i>
<i>battling against the best.</i>

553
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:38,165
- Okay, cheers, guys.
- Cheers!

554
00:37:43,485 --> 00:37:46,165
<i> This year, I have to look</i>
<i>for another contract.</i>

555
00:37:46,245 --> 00:37:48,565
<i>Daniel is very much at a crossroads.</i>

556
00:37:48,645 --> 00:37:50,245
<i> What if I just break free?</i>

557
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:53,085
<i>Max is their chosen star.</i>

558
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:54,605
<i> The better I do,</i>
<i>the better offers I get.</i>

559
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,245
Until I lift that trophy,
I won't be satisfied.

560
00:37:57,925 --> 00:38:00,125
<i>This is my time.</i>
<i>It's my fucking time.</i>

561
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,805
<i> What has happened</i>
<i>to Daniel Ricciardo?</i>

562
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:05,205
<i> I'm losing power...</i>
