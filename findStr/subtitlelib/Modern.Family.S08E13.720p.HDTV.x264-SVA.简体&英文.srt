最新海外影视剧下载

28
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,590
好了
Okay.

29
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,710
螺丝刀
Screwdriver?

30
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,400
备用螺丝刀
Backup screwdriver.

31
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,340
我家族是代代相传的能工巧匠
I come from a long line of handy men.

32
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,390
以前我爸爸什么都自己修好
My dad used to fix everything --

33
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,790
修剪草机  修车子  还阉[修]猫
lawnmowers, cars, our cat.

34
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,610
所以当维修工人试图坑我后
So it made sense that I tackled the clothes dryer

35
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,890
我自然就决定自己修烘衣机
after the repair guy tried to rip me off.

36
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,630
我才不要花350刀
I'm not paying $350

37
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,010
来修一个只值28刀的湿度传感器
for a moisture sensor that costs $28.

38
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,260
我会自己修好它
I'll fix it myself.

39
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,660
维修工作很复杂的
It's a complicated job.

40
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,280
你知道我以前在俄罗斯是干什么的吗
You know what I did back in Russia?

41
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,020
我知道啊
Yeah, yeah, I know.

42
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,080
你是个医生  要不就科学家
You were a doctor or a scientist.

43
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,520
我是修烘衣机的
I fixed dryers.

44
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,710
我意思是  我干这一行很久了
I've been doing this a long time is my point.

45
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,710
本大爷可不是任人宰割的软柿子
Well, your Phil Dunphy is no push-over.

46
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,100
恐怕要坚定地拒绝你了
I'm afraid it's a hard nyet.

47
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,990
其实这些衣服也够干净了
I guess these are clean enough.

48
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,420
我很快就能把这机器修好  亲爱的
I'll have this thing running in no time, honey.

49
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,000
我有维修教学影片
I have an instructional video,

50
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,820
而且我把拆下来的每个零件都做了标记
and I'm labeling each part as I take it out.

51
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,180
"右后角
"Right-back corner.

52
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,550
弯弯的小东西
Tiny elbow-y thingy.

53
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,480
我的右手边  即是烘衣机的左边"
My right. Dryer left."

54
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,930
你们不能到别的地方修吗
Can't you do this somewhere else?

55
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,430
是啊  烘衣机才是该自己搬出去住的那个人
Right, the dryer's the one that needs to get its own place.

56
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,940
宝贝  反正你也该起床了  我们要上烹饪课
Honey, you have to be up anyhow. We've got our cooking class.

57
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,940
我想早点到  抢占前排的炉子
I want to get there early and grab a stove up front.

58
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,370
天啊  妈妈  你跟那个厨师
Oh, my God, Mom. You and that chef.

59
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,780
你能不能轻点骚
Keep it in your apron.

60
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,870
妈妈很迷恋电视上那个大厨查尔斯·杜蒙特
Mom's obsessed with this TV chef Charles Dumont.

61
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,490
她每天都收看他的节目
She watches his show every day.

62
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,260
不过她好像也没有专心听
Not sure she listens, though.

63
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,840
加少许糖
A pinch of sugar,

64
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,830
你的味蕾就会像法国人一样弃械投降
and your taste buds will surrender like the French.

65
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,620
抱歉  这个哏有点太干...奶酪了
I'm sorry, that joke was a little fromage-y.

66
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,890
-他说盐吗  -是糖啦  糖
- Did he say salt? - Sugar. Sugar. Sugar.

67
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,940
我还真想让他尝尝我有多甜呢
Mmm! I'd love to give him some sugar.

68
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,100
但我很肯定他刚刚说的是盐  宝贝
But I'm pretty sure he said salt here, baby.

69
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,370
-试试味道  -不要
- Take taste. - Oh, no. Aah!

70
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,850
-嗯  -好吃吗
- Yeah. - Yeah?

71
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,150
确实别有"风味"
That's got something in it.

72
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,230
烹饪搭配的酒快喝完了
Oh, almost out of cookin' juice.

73
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,940
好了  下一步非常重要
All right, the next step is very important.

74
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,050
你真的不用暂停吗
You sure you don't want to pause it?

75
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,140
不用
Oh, no, I'm good.

76
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,190
不能再这样下去了
We got to fix this.

77
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,850
我们不能告诉她  她做的菜有多难吃
We can't tell her how bad her food is,

78
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,730
因为那会让她伤心欲绝
because that would destroy her.

79
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,230
所以当我得知杜蒙特大厨要来城里
So when I found out Chef Dumont was coming to town,

80
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,030
我就给我俩报名上课  让他来当坏人
I signed us up for his class so he could do it.

81
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,280
场面挺激烈的是吧
I know. Pretty intense, huh?

82
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,610
现在我就把传感器
Now I just grab the sensor

83
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,140
放到...
and put it --

84
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,390
里面棉絮挺多啊
Oh, a little linty.

85
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,830
早知道应该先清空...
I probably should have emptied...

86
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,470
零件都没事吧
Aah! Are the parts okay?

87
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,370
没事
Yeah, they're fine.

88
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,300
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

89
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,570
我不知道...
I don't know --

90
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,610
好了  乔  把球投过来吧
All right, Joe. Fire it in here, buddy.

91
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,290
好棒
Ooh! Yes!

92
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,080
太好了  我不用跟这个儿子也说
Good! Now I don't have to tell another son

93
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,950
有些男孩的天赋跟其他男孩不同
that some boys have different gifts.

94
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,300
干得好  小强棒
Good job there, slugger.

95
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,180
这是怎么回事  歌洛莉亚
What the hell's going on here, Gloria?

96
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,100
我觉得自己好像已经死了
I feel like I died.

97
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,790
我是以游魂视角在看我再婚的家人
I'm watching my family as a ghost.

98
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,150
别傻了  如果你真死了
Don't be silly. If that happened,

99
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,340
我早就已经把这些家具全换掉了
I would have changed all this furniture.

100
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,630
我请了盖里教练
I hired Coach Gary.

101
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,670
他会教乔怎么投球
He's gonna teach Joe how to throw.

102
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,720
乔是他们队里最弱的一个
Joe is the worst on his team.

103
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,500
我听见了哦
I hear you!

104
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,200
你儿子交给我保准没问题  杰
Your son's in good hands, Jay.

105
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,740
去年我带领队伍拿下了冠军
I led my team to the championship last year.

106
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,110
本来幼儿组不该计分的
We weren't supposed to keep score,

107
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,610
但我在脑子里偷记下来了
but I did in my head.

108
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,610
这太离谱了
This is crazy.

109
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,000
这种事情孩子应该跟自己爸爸学
Kid's supposed to learn the stuff from his dad,

110
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,150
例如打棒球  开车
baseball, how to drive a car,

111
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,610
还有怎么跟新泽西州人打架
how to fight a guy from Jersey.

112
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,760
当你觉得你已经拿走了他的刀...
If you think you took his knife...

113
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,930
他身上还有一把
He's got another one.

114
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,600
乔的投球方式都是跟杰学的
Joe learned to throw by copying Jay,

115
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,610
可是杰投得乱七八糟  因为他肩膀不好
but Jay throws all crazy because of his bad shoulder.

116
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,280
像这样投  孩子
Like this, buddy.

117
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,790
我勒个...
Son of a...!

118
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,070
我勒个...
Son of a...!

119
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,430
乔在尿尿时会用口哨吹
It's the same reason Joe whistles

120
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,700
《感伤之旅》也是这个原因
"Sentimental Journey" when he pees.

121
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,700
{\an8}1944年发行的歌曲

122
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,000
你看起来人挺好的
You seem like a nice guy and all,

123
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,710
但我来教他就行了
but I got this.

124
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,850
没问题  盖瑞教练懂的
Hey, no sweat. Coach Gary gets it.

125
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,320
别忘了带走你的球
Hey, uh, don't forget your ball.

126
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,800
没关系  杰  有些男孩的天赋跟其他男孩不同
It's okay, Jay. Some boys have different gifts.

127
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,230
-我去开门  -好的  谢谢
- Let me get the door. - Ok, thank you.

128
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,150
你好  有什么事吗
Hi. Can I help you?

129
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,200
我来找莉莉
I'm here for Lily.

130
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,520
我知道这一天迟早会来
I always knew this day would come.

131
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,980
她应该不是来认亲的
Probably not what she's here for.

132
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,150
你怎么会认识我们女儿
How do you know our daughter?

133
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,340
不认识  她雇我来打扫卫生
I don't. She hired me for a cleaning job.

134
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,260
啥
Oh. What?

135
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,510
真准时啊
Wow. Right on time.

136
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,560
等一下  莉莉  你请了清洁工吗
Wait, Lily, did you hire a cleaning lady?

137
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,920
是啊  用你手机上的应用请的
Yeah, with an app on your phone.

138
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,820
爸爸说我的房间乱得跟猪窝一样
Daddy said my room was a pig sty.

139
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,690
我们回头再讨论你对猪的这个
Okay, we'll double back to that unnecessary

140
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,490
没有必要且有违事实的辱骂
and inaccurate slam on pigs.

141
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,510
而且我想小爸的意思是叫你自己打扫房间
And I think daddy meant for you to clean your room.

142
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,950
我们不能让你帮她打扫房间
We can't have you cleaning our daughter's room.

143
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,980
这样会传递错误的信息
It just -- It sends the wrong message.

144
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,230
我们也可以给你们差评的  知道吗
We get to review you guys, too, you know.

145
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,520
你去打扫房间
Go clean your room.

146
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,020
这不公平  你们什么都用手机应用解决
It's not fair. You guys use apps for everything.

147
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,460
我们才没有
No, we don't.

148
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,300
这个嘛...
Well...

149
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,650
好吧  我们出去吃饭时会用"优步"叫车
Okay, there's Uber for when we eat out...

150
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,530
在家吃饭会用"美团"叫外卖
and Postmates when we eat at.

151
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,350
各种家务就交给"寻人理事"找帮手
And TaskGrabBag for stuff around the house.

152
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,080
"洗衣到府"  "车位地图"
And Washio and ParkMe

153
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,630
还有那个请专人来
and the one where the guy comes over

154
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,880
帮家里壁炉生火的应用
and builds a fire in your fireplace.

155
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,870
"专人取火"啊  我喜欢那个
Oh, LogBuddy. I love LogBuddy.

156
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,900
我们必须以身作则
We need to start leading by example.

157
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,200
从现在开始  我们都要更自力更生
From now on, we're all gonna be a little more self-reliant.

158
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,500
首先  我自己来生火
For starters, I'll build the fires.

159
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,680
可是"专人取火"那个人会打扮成猛男伐木工
But the LogBuddy guy comes dressed as a lumberjack.

160
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,920
我也有猛男法兰绒衬衫啊
I have a flannel shirt.

161
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,150
那些多出来的零件到哪里去了
Where are all the extra pieces?

162
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,530
没有多余的  我全装上了
There aren't any. I used every last one.

163
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,670
你是不是丢掉了
Did you throw them away?

164
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,400
你可以直说  我不会生气的
You can tell me. I won't be angry.

165
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,980
我把烘衣机修好了  克莱尔
I fixed the dryer, Claire,

166
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,440
你有幸见证这一奇迹般的时刻
and you get to be here for the moment of truth.

167
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,220
拔掉保险销
Pull the pin.

168
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
真的修好了
It works.

169
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,520
我以前都不知道你是如此巧手
I had no idea you were so good with your hands.

170
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,010
很有男子气概
Very manly.

171
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,580
前面我的拇指还被老虎钳夹到了
I pinched my thumb with a pair of pliers earlier.

172
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,960
我都没喊疼
Not a peep.

173
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,770
卢克  你爸和我要上楼去
Luke, daddy and I need to go upstairs

174
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,470
私下谈些事情
to discuss something in private.

175
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,430
去就别废话  快被你们恶心得一生不举了
Just go. You're ruining sex for me.

176
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,850
床单都因为摩擦太激烈起静电了
Oh, we just created some static in these sheets, huh?

177
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,520
-那感觉真是太棒了  -是啊
- That felt amazing. - Yeah.

178
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,110
我深入那台烘衣机把它修了个落花流水
I got all up in that dryer and fixed the hell out of it.

179
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,260
我觉得我无所不能
I feel capable of anything.

180
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,310
你猜怎么着
You know what?

181
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:54,850
我要展开那项工程了
I'm gonna build it.

182
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,520
-邓菲塔吗  -邓菲塔
- Dunphy Tower? - Dunphy Tower.

183
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,570
邓菲塔
Dunphy Tower --

184
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,620
我的首次商业房地产开发
My first commercial real-estate development.

185
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,330
我从小就梦想能建这样一栋楼
I've been dreaming of building it since I was a kid,

186
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,920
现在终于要成真了
Now it's all happening.

187
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,200
好吧  虽然没了楼顶的蹦床公园
Well, minus the trampoline park on the roof

188
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,190
和通向我死党家的地道
and the tunnel to my best friend's house.

189
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,690
我仍抱着希望能有一根消防队那种钢管
I am still holding out hope for a fireman's pole

190
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,510
可以直接滑到地下停车场
that takes you to the parking garage.

191
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,970
如果你认为自己终于准备好了就做
Well, if you're sure you're finally ready.

192
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,580
我当然准备好了  
Of course I am.

193
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,090
我可是刚刚修好了烘衣机的男人
I just fixed the dryer.

194
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,790
那是我这辈子干过的最满足最爽的事了
And it was the most satisfying thing I've ever done.

195
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,040
我起身穿衣服吧
I'll just get dressed, I guesse.

196
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,730
菲尔  我又不是不知道我们在哪
Phil, I know where we are.

197
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,580
刚才是我开的车
I drove.

198
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,560
你知道这是什么地方
You know what this is,

199
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,460
但我要告诉你这里将会变成什么地方
but I'm about to tell you what this could be.

200
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,490
我最不喜欢这种说话方式
This is my least-favorite way of talking.

201
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,550
你所站之处将成为未来的邓菲塔
You are standing on the site of the future Dunphy Tower.

202
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,480
1011平方米的混合应用土地
A quarter acre of mixed-use space

203
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,430
在这片住户高速士绅化的区域
in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood.

204
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,010
商业房地产开发啊
Commercial real estate, huh?

205
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,650
不像你的作风啊
This is a departure for you.

206
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,460
我每一个细节都考虑过了
I thought about it down to the last detail.

207
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,740
想象一位开心的工人
Imagine a happy worker

208
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,590
从上班坐车方便的办公室下楼来这
coming down from their transit-friendly office

209
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,630
喝杯高级咖啡或者做做瑜伽
for a fancy coffee beverage or yoga,

210
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,060
你猜那边还有什么好东西
and what's that over there?

211
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,340
我希望那只是洋娃娃的断腿
A doll's foot, I hope.

212
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,990
农场直供的狗狗面包店
A farm-to-table dog bakery.

213
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,710
我带斯黛拉去过丹麦村的一家
Ooh, Stella and I went to one of those in Solvang.

214
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
我给她买了个法式乳蛋狗饼
She got a quiche.

215
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,400
看起来特好吃  我差点没忍住和她分着吃
It looked so good, I almost split it with her.

216
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,850
我不想逼你投资
I don't want you to feel pressured to invest,

217
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,290
但我想让你知道这不是一时兴起
but I want you to know this isn't a whim.

218
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,760
这件事我已经构想了很久了
I've been thinking about this a lot.

219
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,320
是什么让你决定出手的
What got you off the sidelines?

220
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,130
这可能听起来有点蠢
This is gonna sound silly,

221
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,260
但我今天修好了一台烘衣机
but I fixed a dryer today.

222
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,730
我把它彻底拆开还换了传感器
I took it all apart and swapped out the sensor.

223
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,720
你少来了
Get out of here.

224
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,130
修理工跟我要价350块
The guy wanted 350 bucks.

225
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,010
我自己只花了28
I paid $28.

226
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,150
真厉害
Holy cow!

227
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,540
你为什么等到现在才告诉我这件事
Ho come we haven't been talking about this the whole time?

228
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,460
因为这个项目让我太兴奋了
Because I'm so excited about this project.

229
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,350
我真的认为这会是一项好投资
I-I really think this could be a good investment.

230
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,390
你不必多说了
I don't want to hear any more.

231
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,180
涉及到生意的时候
You're the most cautious guy I know

232
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,160
你是我认识的人中最谨慎的
when it comes to business.

233
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,850
如果你认为这是个金矿  我入伙
If you think this is a slam dunk, I'm in.

234
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,590
真的吗
Really?

235
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,950
因为我已经准备好出价了
'Cause I have an offer ready to go.

236
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,200
你一发话我就发出去
You say the word, I hit "Send."

237
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,390
发吧  我一直在找投资商机
Do it. I've been looking for investment opportunities.

238
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,520
如果你有信心  那我也有信心
If you're confident, I'm confident.

239
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,470
因为你很清楚害我血本无归
Because you know what I'll do to you

240
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,780
你会有什么下场
if you blow my money.

241
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,730
好了  你将学到
All right, you are about to get

242
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,120
关于自力更生的宝贵一课  小姑娘
an important lesson on self-reliance, young lady.

243
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,290
每当他叫我"小姑娘"就知道是来真的
I know he's serious when he calls me "Young lady."

244
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,460
我爸也一样  好啦
My dad did the same thing. Okay.

245
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,920
不再靠我们的手机来摆脱家务了
Okay, no more doing chores with our phones.

246
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,110
我们要亲力亲为
We're going to get our hands dirty.

247
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,170
米奇尔  快来像修体毛一样修整这丛植物
And, Mitchell, you're gonna start right here and manscape this.

248
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,430
-真的吗  好吧  -猜猜你的任务是什么
- Really? Okay. - And guess what you're gonna do?

249
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,950
我能像咱家园丁那样负责往水泥上浇水吗
Can I be in charge of watering the cement like the gardener?

250
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,250
{\an8}新铺的水泥地也像草皮一样需要浇水养护

251
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,250
不行  你得趴到草地上去
Nope. You're gonna get down on your hands and knees

252
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,660
拔杂草
and pick weeds.

253
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,430
你知道我在你这个年纪都要做些什么吗
You know what I had to do when I was your age?

254
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,850
我得爬遍整块玉米田捡石头
I had to crawl through a cornfield and pick up rocks.

255
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,350
捡不到一百块石头都不让我吃早饭
I couldn't even have breakfast until I picked 100.

256
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,910
我会在头上绑一个手电筒  深入田间
I'd strap a flashlight to my head, and off I'd go.

257
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,980
一块石头  两块石头
One rock, two rocks,

258
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,010
我的天哪
Oh, my God!

259
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,790
这叫戏剧张力好吗
It's called dramatic tension.

260
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,710
-是叫蜂窝  就在那  -什么
- It's called a beehive. Right-Right there. - What?!

261
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,510
没错
Yep. Mm-hmm.

262
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,110
-不  何止是蜂窝  -没错
- Oh, Oh, no. It's worse. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,440
-还是马蜂窝呢  -我讨厌马蜂
- Those are wasps. - Oh, I hate wasps!

264
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,230
不  我不是在骂你  佛莱彻先生
No, not you, Mr. Fletcher. The...

265
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,530
拜托
Come on.

266
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,050
歌洛莉亚
Gloria?

267
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,180
菲尔说服我投资了一家小型商场
Phil got me to invest in a mini-mall,

268
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,380
所以你这阵子最好克制点
so you might want to dial back

269
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,110
少买几双鞋
on the shoe purchases for a while.

270
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,580
等一下等一下
One second. One second.

271
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,660
"确认订单"
"Place order."

272
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,360
你刚才说啥  亲爱的
What did you say, baby?

273
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,870
-抽屉修好了  -搞毛啊
- Drawer's fixed. - What the hell?!

274
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,510
别这样一声不响突然吓人
Don't sneak up on people like that.

275
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,420
我很可能一拳揍昏你
I'm liable to have knocked you out.

276
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,670
我表示怀疑
I doubt it.

277
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,020
再说我本来正准备修的
I was gonna fix that, anyway.

278
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,070
你还说要清理屋檐排水沟呢
Ay. Like you were going to clean the gutter?

279
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,850
盖里教练已经清完了
Coach Gary did it already.

280
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,100
一点都不麻烦
It really wasn't a problem.

281
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,170
我不怕高  还有一双大手
I'm not afraid of heights, and I've got big hands.

282
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,710
真是有趣的个人情报
Those are fun details.

283
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,550
这家伙就像想抢走我的生活似的
It's like the guy was trying to steal my life.

284
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,360
我还和迪迪在一起的时候有他在就好了
I wish he'd shown up when I was married to Dede.

285
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,540
我会直接给他配把钥匙
I would have made him a key.

286
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,670
让我送你到门口  尽管貌似
Let me show you out, although you sound like

287
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,250
你已经对我家很熟悉了
you know the place pretty good already.

288
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,750
杰  我周五晚上有个约会
Hey, Jay, I've got a date Friday night.

289
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,570
能把你的车借我吗
Can I borrow your car?

290
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,230
没问题  你可以借你妈的车
Sure, you can borrow your mother's car.

291
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,190
是哪个姑娘这么幸运
Who's the lucky girl?

292
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,330
瑞秋·卡普托
Rachel Caputo.

293
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,510
她和曼尼一起做校报
She and Manny work on the school paper together.

294
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,440
号外号外  那姑娘特可爱
Extra, extra! She's a cutie.

295
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
多谢你帮忙
Thanks for your help.

296
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,760
我不过弹了一段尤克里里
Hey, I just played the ukulele.

297
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,040
歌是你自己唱的
You sang the song.

298
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,810
丘比特教练
Yeah. Coach Cupid!

299
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,880
好了  快走吧
All right, gear.

300
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,360
错过公交车就麻烦了
You don't want to miss that bus.

301
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,660
再次感谢  盖里教练
Thanks again, Coach Gary.

302
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,290
他都不是你的教练
He's not even your coach.

303
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,760
我得喝杯威士忌连看几部007
I need a scotch and a James Bond marathon.

304
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,610
那你可能要失望了
You may be out of luck.

305
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,110
刚才电视突然坏了
The TV wasn't working a minute ago.

306
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,490
听起来像是卫星天线的问题
Sounds like the satellite dish.

307
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,130
可能是大手男乱搞我排水沟时撞歪了
Big hands probably mess it up poking around my gutters.

308
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,660
-让我上去看看  -别别别
- Let me check it out. - No, no, no.

309
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,190
可能会很危险的
That might be very dangerous.

310
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,610
让我去把盖里教练叫回来  让他帮你
Let me go grab Coach Gary, and he can help you.

311
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,390
我说了我自己去
I said I'd do it.

312
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,670
但我很肯定盖里教练
Yeah, but I'm sure Coach Gary

313
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,210
不介意多留一会的
wouldn't mind sticking around.

314
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,980
我自己出去修就行了
I'm getting out and pressure myself!

315
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
感谢大家来上课
Thank you all for coming.

316
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,660
有谁想现在就去巴黎
Who here wants to go to Paris right now?

317
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,630
我[法语]
Moi!

318
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,510
不  我们不是要真的上飞机
No. We're not getting on a plane.

319
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,150
这些普通的食材将带我们体验巴黎的味道
We'll be transported by these humble ingredients.

320
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,700
他是不是很棒
How great is he?

321
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,750
超棒  仔细听他说的每一句话
So great. Listen to everything he says.

322
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,030
看看你们的左边  再看看你们的右边
Look to your left. Look to your right.

323
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,860
这节课结束前
Before this class is through,

324
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,240
你们都会学会做伯爵烤鸡
all of you will know how to make earl roasted chicken

325
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,540
我知道这个食谱
Ohh! I know this recipe.

326
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,930
我在睡梦中也能做出来
I could make this chicken in my sleep.

327
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,000
咱还是醒着做吧
How about we try it awake?

328
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,170
让我们从最重要的食材开始  百里香
Let's start with the most important ingredient -- thyme.

329
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,440
没错  "白丽"美人切百里香
That's right. It's time to chop thyme.

330
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,520
他和电视上一样有哏
He's just like he is on TV.

331
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,080
是啊
Yeah.

332
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,230
百里香和鸡肉非常搭
Thyme and chicken play together very well,

333
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,460
不像狗跟鸡在一起玩[搭]那样
unlike dogs and chickens.

334
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,540
悲惨故事  我的救援惠比特犬与我
Tragic story, my rescue and I

335
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,230
住在个都市农场边上...
live next to an urban farm and...

336
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,000
天啊  我可以用这个作范例吗
Oh, my, do you mind if I use this as an example?

337
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,070
荣幸之至
Oh! Avec pleasure.

338
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,860
看到她怎么切这些根茎了吗
See how she's chopped it stems and all?

339
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,250
这是错的
That's wrong.

340
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,320
马虎可是会毁了这道菜
Sloppiness like this can ruin a dish.

341
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,800
我都不知道呢
Oh. I had no idea.

342
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,550
果然你在草药这一领域
I suppose when it comes to herbs, though,

343
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,420
你也算是鼠[尾草]一鼠二
you owe something of a sage.

344
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,920
-好双关  -谢谢
That's clever. Thank you.

345
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,150
但双关不能吃
You can't eat clever.

346
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,360
不许动  警察
Freeze! Police!

347
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,270
我是房产经纪人  不是罪犯
I'm a realtor, not a criminal.

348
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,120
那你当房产经纪人的功夫不够火候
Oh, well, then you're not doing it right.

349
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,140
吉尔
Hey, Gil.

350
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,430
如果你的客户真考虑
If one of your clients is actually thinking

351
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,490
买这块雷区的话
about buying this minefield,

352
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,360
那就是他们犯的第二大错
that would be their second bad decision.

353
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,930
-第一大是雇了你  -我猜到了
- First was hiring you. - Yeah, I got it.

354
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,910
你不会真劝你的客户
You're not gonna push one of your clients

355
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,230
买这块破地吧
into this swamp, are you?

356
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,470
可能它只是需要一个
Maybe it just needs a developer

357
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,460
有远见的开发商
with a little vision.

358
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,330
没啥远见  还没嗅觉
Very little vision and no sense of smell.

359
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,050
这块地让穷人区埃尔塞贡多
This neighborhood makes El Segundo

360
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,380
闻起来像美容化妆品店
seem like a Sephora.

361
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,690
它正处于转型期
It's in transition.

362
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,200
是啊  转型成费卢杰[伊拉克城市]
Yeah, it's turning into Fallujah.

363
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,390
我得走了  不然会被打劫的
I'm out of here before I get jacked.

364
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,950
-你还要在这待一阵子吗  -说不定呢
- You're gonna be around for a while? - I might.

365
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,480
那你可以给我搞点借代毒品美沙酮
Maybe you can score me some methadone.

366
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,310
鲍勃
Hey, Bob.

367
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,440
好消息  菲尔  他们接受了你的报价
Good news, Phil. They accepted your offer.

368
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,810
没有还价吗  我可能出的太高了
Without a counter? Maybe I came too high.

369
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,480
随便吧  他们很开心
Whatever. They were really happy.

370
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,210
是
Are...

371
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,180
等下  鲍勃  我儿子的电话
Hold on, Bob. It's my son.

372
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,190
卢克  怎么了
Luke, what's up?

373
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,550
爸
Dad?

374
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,540
烘衣机好像出问题了
I think something is wrong with the dryer.

375
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,220
但我已经修好了啊
But I-I fixed it.

376
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,470
好到无话可说
I fixed it good.

377
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,430
我马上到
I'll be right there.

378
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,770
快点  它好像要跑了
Hurry! I think it's leaving.

379
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,290
现在  这是生鲜食品
Now, this is fresh produce.

380
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,470
我甚至不能描述
I can't even describe...

381
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,020
三振出局
Strike three!

382
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,520
这算哪门子的提高
How exactly is this an improvement?

383
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,020
反正是杰选的那个灯
Jay picked that lamp.

384
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,470
对了  你有见到他吗
By the way. Have you seen him?

385
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,050
我不知道我怎么困住的
I don't know how I got stuck.

386
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,350
我从14岁开始就经常上房顶
I've been on roofs since I was 14 and discovered

387
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,190
发现那是看埃塞尔·伯京卧室最好的地点
it was the best way to see into Ethel Burkin's bedroom.

388
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,270
老女人  50多岁
Older gal. 50s, I think.

389
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,000
放到现在估计都不会多看她一眼
Today you probably wouldn't give him a second look,

390
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,550
但那会儿还没网络
but this was before the Internet.

391
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,750
不看她就得看百货内衣目录
It was either that or a Sears catalog.

392
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,750
我能拍个照吗
Can I take a picture of this?

393
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,250
有时候我朋友觉得我的故事太扯
Sometimes my friends don't believe my stories.

394
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,990
应该有更好的方法
There's gonna be a better way of doing this.

395
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,070
正相反  米奇尔
On the contrary, Mitchell.

396
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,360
这简单极了
It's simplicity itself.

397
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,900
我打掉马蜂窝  掉到垃圾桶里
I dislodge the nest. It falls into the trash can.

398
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,030
你盖上盖子
You close the lid.

399
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,890
那我们就有一桶愤怒的马蜂
Then we just have a barrel full of angry wasps.

400
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,560
它们会很快被送到郊外的农场
They will be swiftly transported to a farm up state

401
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,090
在那儿它们会更加幸福
where they'll be much happier.

402
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,080
它们还能见到我朋友的狗呢
Ooh, they'll see my friend's dog.

403
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,860
是啊  没错
Yeah, just like that.

404
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,860
{\an8}常见的骗小孩宠物没死掉  只是送去乡下的借口

405
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,450
好啦  首先  我们打掉马蜂窝
All right. First, we just have to dislodge the nest.

406
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,390
不  不  不
No, no, no, no!

407
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,330
我脸上有一只  还有
There's one on my face. There's one --

408
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,400
别动  我被敌人发现了
Don't move. I've been compromised.

409
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,600
快进屋里
Get in the house!

410
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,440
喔  喔  喔  真是个坏主意
Ow! Ow! Oh! Ow! Ooh! Bad idea!

411
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,070
我本是要把你们送到农场呢
Ow! I was gonna take you to a farm!

412
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,210
我可能得把这个配菜的名字改为
I may have to change the name of this side dish

413
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,890
不"菜"的土豆烤菜
to "Potatoes au great-in."

414
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,580
改前改后没啥差别啊
I'm not hearing a difference.

415
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,680
烤"菜"双关...
Gratin...

416
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,400
这很独特
Oh, this is...unique.

417
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,730
是的  太谢谢你啦
Yes, thank you very much.

418
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,420
在你的节目中  你总是敢于冒险尝试
You know how on your show you were always taking chances

419
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,540
相信你的直觉
and trusting your instincts?

420
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,860
我也这么做了
Well, that is what I did.

421
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,490
那是因为我直觉很准
That's because I have good instincts.

422
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,520
你什么事做得好
What's something you do well?

423
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,450
烹饪
Cook?

424
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,200
不
No.

425
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,830
妈  我想他想说的是
Uh, mom, I think what he's trying to say

426
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,970
你应该严格按照他的食谱来做
is that you should more closely follow his recipe.

427
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,910
用他提到的食材
You know, use the ingredients that he mentions.

428
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,800
而且都该测量好
Measure stuff.

429
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,040
-对吧  -才不是
- Right? - Not at all.

430
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,250
正如我在我的第三本书
As I say in the foreword

431
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,100
《谁不会做饭》的前言中所说
of my third book, "Who Can't Cook?"

432
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,230
"有些人就是不会做饭"
"Some people can't cook."

433
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,890
别难过
Don't feel bad.

434
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,010
美食烹调很难
Gourmet cooking is tough,

435
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,680
不过你做的鸡肉"更难"嚼
though not as tough as your chicken.

436
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,280
真不敢相信会听到你这话
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

437
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,100
就是因为像这样的情况
It's times like this

438
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,330
我才希望我们有退款政策
I wish I had a refund policy.

439
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,200
等下
Wait a second.

440
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,120
我这几个月
I have been making

441
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,840
一直给我的家人做这些
this food for my family for months now.

442
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,590
每周日都做一顿大餐
I make a big meal every Sunday.

443
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,710
我是上班族妈妈
I'm a working mom.

444
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,430
这是我一周中为家人做些什么
It's my one chance a week to give my family something

445
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,650
弥补我错过的时光的唯一机会
and make up for the time I haven't spent with them.

446
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,740
你是在告诉我  我一直在给我家人做垃圾吗
Are you telling me I've been giving my family garbage?

447
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,500
等下
Wait, uh...

448
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,530
海莉  亲爱的
Haley, honey,

449
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,870
我给你做的是垃圾吗
have I been serving you garbage?

450
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,530
你觉得我会说什么
What do you think I said?

451
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,890
她是最好的厨师
She is the best cook ever.

452
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,220
我们喜欢她做的所有的菜
We love all of her meals.

453
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,460
-是不是像音乐一样悦耳  -太棒了
- Am I singing? - So good.

454
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,570
太
So...

455
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,630
杰
Jay?

456
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,700
杰
Jay!

457
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,350
我在上面
I'm up here.

458
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,150
我的天啊  天妒英才  英年早逝啊
Ay, Dios mio! Your time was too short!

459
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,320
我在屋顶
I'm on the roof.

460
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,900
好的
Ah. Oh, okay.

461
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,030
下来吧  电视已经好了
So come down because the TV's working already.

462
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,940
我很享受待在这儿
You know, I'm kind of enjoying hanging out up here.

463
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,100
等会儿我再下去
I-I'll be down in a little bit.

464
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,030
如果乔想锻炼投球的手臂
Hey, if Joe wants to work on his throwing arm,

465
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,470
他可以投个空瓶子上来
maybe he can toss up, uh, an empty bottle.

466
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,930
你被困在上面了吗
Are you stuck up there?

467
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,820
困住  才没有
Stuck? No!

468
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,150
我随时想下来就可以下来
I can come down whenever I want to.

469
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,590
我只要把身体挂到天台边缘
I just have to... dangle my body out over the edge

470
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,930
然后凭感觉踩上
and then reach blindly

471
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,220
不应该踩的梯子最顶端那一阶就行了
for that top rung of the ladder you're not supposed to use.

472
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,560
但我等会再回去
But I'll be in in a little bit.

473
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,410
我这还有些事要搞定
I got a few things I got to do.

474
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,060
我得先保养一下这个房顶
Got to maintain the roof.

475
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,890
这可是你家房子的帽子
It's your house's hat.

476
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,170
我打电话给了一个
I called the one person

477
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,010
我绝不可能在他面前感到丢脸的人
I couldn't possibly be embarrassed in front of.

478
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,430
外公的电话
It's grandpa.

479
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,470
不要接  不能让他知道这件事
Don't answer! He can't know about this.

480
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,390
我们有一个基本上是因为我有能力
We have a verbal contract that's largely based

481
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,290
修好烘干机才达成的口头协议
on my ability to fix dryers.

482
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,290
拜托一定要好
Please work.

483
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,180
成功了
Yes!

484
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,690
..吧
Maybe.

485
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,340
-那是什么味道  -失败的味道
- What's that smell? - Failure.

486
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,930
小卡  那个蛰伤看起来挺严重的
Oh, Cam, that sting looks really bad.

487
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,410
我们应该带你找个医生看看
We -- We should get you to a doctor.

488
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,300
被马蜂蜇[上流人笑]就找医生吗
A doctor for a wasps sting?

489
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,310
{\an8}WASP: 原指殖民时代来自英国的新教上流社会移民
这类白人常带有种族主义  排外主义  反同  文化种族优越感

490
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,710
行啊  让我们戴上大礼帽
Yes, let's put on our top hats

491
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,310
在去的路上再吃点英国小圆饼
and eat crumpets while we're on our way.

492
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,960
好啦  我知道你觉得自觉言之有理
Okay, I know you think you're making a point.

493
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,360
以前在农场的时候
Back on the farm,

494
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,550
每次我们除掉马蜂窝的时候
every time we would take down a wasp nest,

495
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,920
我总是要被蛰一下
I would get stung.

496
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,970
这事你应该提前说的
Something you might have mentioned.

497
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,440
我从没需要擦过那些高级的药膏
And never once did I need fancy medicine.

498
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,660
就是抹上一点泥
Just a little mud.

499
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,790
没错  莉莉
That's right, Lily.

500
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:52,020
大爸就是这么自立自强
Daddy's being self-reliant.

501
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,830
你觉得他说的泥有几成机率是指真的泥土
What do you think the chances are he means actuall mud?

502
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,590
几率非常高
Pretty good.

503
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,810
就像我阿姨多特说过的
Like my Aunt Dot said,

504
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,820
"不论是被蜜蜂蛰了还是背疼
"Whether it's bee stings or back aches,

505
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,190
一点泥巴就可以帮助你缓解疼痛"
a little mud is good for what ails you."

506
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,880
我怎么不记得见过哪个多特阿姨
I don't remember meeting an Aunt Dot.

507
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
她已经去世了
She died.

508
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,790
15分钟后
15 minutes later.

509
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,390
好吧
All right.

510
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,630
我想我给你做了一点
I thought I'd make you a little bit --

511
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,940
要了亲命
Oh, my God!

512
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,950
咋了  我的脸吗
What? My face?

513
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,700
很糟糕吗  我感觉很糟糕
Is it bad? It feels bad.

514
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,490
它看上去有一点像
It looks a little like

515
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,120
电影里人的脸被融化掉的样子
you stared directly into the Lost Ark.

516
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,300
-我想照镜子看看  -你不会想看到的
- I want to see. - You don't.

517
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,360
你觉得会不会是因为我擦了泥才让它恶化了
Do you think maybe me putting mud on it made it worse?

518
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,120
我是不知道把脏兮兮的泥土直接擦在伤口上...
I don't know how putting dirt directly into a wound --

519
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,600
会不..会  你要去哪
It -- It -- Where are you going?

520
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,970
去找医生  我想要重新找回我的颜值
To the doctor. I want to be pretty again.

521
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,520
好吧  那咱们不自力更生了吗
Well, w-what about being self-reliant?

522
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,820
伤的是人家的脸蛋啊  快点啦
It's my face! Let's go!

523
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,800
马蜂  它们还在门外
Wasps! They're still out there!

524
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,670
可以  我能等
Yeah, I'll hold.

525
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,620
我要撤回这笔交易
I'm pulling out of the deal.

526
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,740
为什么  怎么啦
Why? What happened?

527
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,700
我并不是你心目中那
I'm not the man you thought 

528
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,170
大白天跟你滚床单的霸气男人
you had middle of the day sex with.

529
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,860
亲爱的  我听说烘干机的事了
Honey, I heard about the dryer.

530
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,720
不只是因为这个
It's not just that.

531
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,080
我还遇到格尔  他觉得这是自寻死路
I ran into Gil. He thinks it's a bad idea.

532
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,530
我也得顾虑你爸投进来的钱
Your dad's money is on the line.

533
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,060
我从没做过像这样的事
I've never done anything like this.

534
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,710
谁管格尔·索普觉得怎么样
Who cares what Gil Thorpe thinks?

535
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,880
世上没人比你还懂房地产不是吗
Nobody knows more about real estate than you do,

536
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,060
而且你已经琢磨这项目很久了
and you've been thinking about this project for a long time.

537
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,500
我对你有信心
I believe in you.

538
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,140
你也应该对自己有信心
You should believe in yourself.

539
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
鲍伯
Yeah, hey, Bob.

540
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,070
是菲尔
It's Phil.

541
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,290
删除掉抽身条款吧  咱们干到底
Remove the contingencies. Let's do this.

542
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,800
这是真的吗
Is that a fact?

543
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,110
感谢你告诉我这事
Thanks for letting me know.

544
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,150
格尔·索普也给了个后备开价
Gil Thorpe made a backup offer.

545
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,000
他只是想把我给吓走
He was just trying to scare me away.

546
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,590
我真是以你为荣
Oh! I am so proud of you!

547
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,090
貌似我们两个
Wow. Looks like the both of us had

548
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,160
今天都遇到了一点信心危机
a little crisis of confidence today.

549
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,930
今天上烹饪班时...
In my cooking classs...

550
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,980
-然后呢  -是这样的
- Yes? - Yes, well,

551
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,930
杜蒙特大厨居然大言不惭说
Chef Dumont had the audacity

552
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,670
我压根就不是块做饭的料
to tell me that I can't cook.

553
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,540
幸好  有她在现场反驳了他的屁话
Luckily, this one was there to straighten him out.

554
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,160
我要给你做一顿庆祝晚餐
I'm gonna make you a celebratory dinner.

555
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,640
我觉得我应该有大多数材料了
I think I've got most of the ingredients.

556
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,170
我真是等不及啦
I can't wait! Mm-hmm.

557
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,280
就给了你一个任务
You had one job.

558
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,080
杰
Hi, Jay.

559
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,140
靠  她打给你搬救兵了
Oh, crap. She called you.

560
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,130
手给我
Give me your hand.

561
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,360
为啥  好让你再羞辱我一次吗
Why? So you can show me up again?

562
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,980
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

563
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,230
你就省省吧
Give it a rest.

564
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,460
大摇大摆带着你那强健的年轻肩膀
You come in here with your young shoulders,

565
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,900
还有尤克里里来显摆
your ukulele.

566
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,900
杰  我从来没有想要羞辱你啊
I'm not trying to show you up, Jay.

567
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,950
我是想给你制造好印象
I'm trying to impress you.

568
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,240
你为毛会想给我制造好印象啊
Why the heck would you want to do that?

569
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,290
其实跟你现在有点像
I guess you could say like you,

570
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,440
我在自己的事上有点搁浅了
I'm stranded in my own way.

571
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,230
我实在很不喜欢这么说话
This is my least-favorite way of talking.

572
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,540
杰  我老实告诉你
I got to tell you, Jay,

573
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,360
我想退出运动界了
I'm over the whole sports thing.

574
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,870
可你才刚赢得冠军啊
But you just won the championship.

575
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,560
没错
Exactly.

576
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,470
对我来说世上已无龙可斩
And there's no more Dragons to slay.

577
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,140
这不是比喻  我是指去年打败的队
That's the team we beat last year --

578
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,280
淡蓝宝宝龙
the Baby Blue Dragons.

579
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,160
我还是完全没懂你啥意思
I'm not seeing how I figure into this.

580
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,800
我想自己创业
I want to start my own business.

581
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,340
而你是成功多年的前辈
You've been so successful.

582
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,300
我在想或许能找你当我的导师
I was thinking maybe you could be my mentor.

583
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,270
哪方面的生意
What line of work?

584
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,540
预组装凉亭
Pre-fab gazebos.

585
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,530
赞耶
Nice!

586
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,660
把每家的后院变成自家的市中心广场
Every backyard could be its own town square.

587
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,690
我就知道你会懂
I knew you'd get it.

588
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,330
毕竟  所有的凉亭
After all, what's a gazebo but...

589
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,950
-都是户外的衣柜嘛  -户外的衣柜嘛
- An outdoor closet! - an outdoor closet?

590
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,670

00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,710
你都不需要请教我
You don't need me.

597
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,650
好啦
All right.

598
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,270
这是你独自坐在空荡荡后院
Is this you sitting alone in an empty yard

599
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,680
幻想着如果你有...
wishing you had....

600
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,830
一个凉亭

601
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,200
