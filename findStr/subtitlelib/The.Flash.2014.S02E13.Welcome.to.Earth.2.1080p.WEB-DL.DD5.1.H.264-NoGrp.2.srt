1
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:02,965
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:05,701
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,703 --> 00:00:08,738
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,774
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,378
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,169
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,615
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:23,986
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:27,290
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,292 --> 00:00:29,025
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:31,794
I'm in full-on Vibe mode right now.

12
00:00:31,796 --> 00:00:34,530
I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris.

13
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:35,765
I felt slower.

14
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:38,367
I did it. I stole your speed.

15
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:39,702
I gave it to Zoom.

16
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:41,137
Give me back my daughter.

17
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:45,141
Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.

18
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:46,442
I told you we're a team.

19
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:47,977
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

20
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:49,412
We're going to Earth-2.

21
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:53,978
Journal log entry 115,

22
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,214
my last entry.

23
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:59,751
On this earth, we're closing the breaches,

24
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:01,386
all of them.

25
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:05,590
Soon, every portal
between this earth and mine

26
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:07,158
will no longer exist.

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,196
I've become distracted by this Earth,

28
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:13,665
its problems, its people.

29
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,866
29.

30
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,868
28.

31
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,369
27.

32
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:19,904
26.

33
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:22,340
But the one thing I never lost track of

34
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:24,008
was you, Jesse.

35
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,511
You are my conscience, my beating heart.

36
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:28,146
You're the reason I made it this far

37
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:30,815
in my fight against Zoom, and now

38
00:01:30,817 --> 00:01:34,052
I just need you to hang on.

39
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:39,357
Hang on a little bit longer because...

40
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,092
I'm coming to get you,

41
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:44,863
and this time...

42
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:46,231
I'm not coming alone.

43
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:59,811
Bam. Uhh, that's how it's done.

44
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:01,246
- Ooh.
- Whoo.

45
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:02,747
He shoots. He scores.

46
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,716
Not bad for a guy who got a C in gym.

47
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:05,783
D plus.

48
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:07,385
Straight up F right here.

49
00:02:07,387 --> 00:02:09,187
Can't believe it.
We closed all the breaches.

50
00:02:09,189 --> 00:02:10,788
All except the one.

51
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,390
Our last way to Earth-2.

52
00:02:12,392 --> 00:02:13,992
Ready?

53
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:16,728
Yeah, I just have a few things
to take care of first.

54
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,930
Just a reminder, Allen...

55
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,798
Clock's ticking.

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,567
It always is.

You know you haven't made lasagna

59
00:02:27,874 --> 00:02:28,973
since I left for college?

60
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:31,042
Well,

61
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:33,378
college is a hell of a lot
closer than another Earth.

62
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,780
Hey.

63
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:38,583
Did you tell Henry?

64
00:02:38,585 --> 00:02:40,752
No. I... look, if he knew,

65
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:42,620
he would just try to talk me out of it

66
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:45,223
and he probably would, so...

67
00:02:45,225 --> 00:02:48,426
Dad, can you give us a minute?

68
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,131
Yeah, I'll make us some coffee.

69
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,435
Look, Iris.

70
00:02:57,437 --> 00:03:00,905
I know that this is...

71
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:04,208
Nuts is the only word
I can think of right now,

72
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,878
but it's not like I've never
done anything dangerous before.

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,782
Look, I... I get why you are doing this.

74
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:12,684
Innocent people are in danger.

75
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:15,253
That's always been the direction
that you've run in,

76
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,956
even... even when you ran
a little bit slower.

77
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:21,459
I just...

78
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:23,461
I want to make sure
that you're not doing this

79
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:25,964
because you think that you don't
have anything left here anymore.

80
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:31,502
This isn't about Patty.

81
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,104
It's not.

82
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:36,107
I mean, of course, you know,

83
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:38,209
I miss her a lot,

84
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:40,979
but I know what I have here.

85
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:43,281
I love my life.

86
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:46,384
I love my job, being The Flash.

87
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:50,021
I love you and Joe.

88
00:03:50,023 --> 00:03:52,523
I'm not trying to escape.

89
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,360
I promise.

90
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:57,929
Go win, Barry,

91
00:03:57,931 --> 00:04:01,733
and then come home.

92
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:03,301
All right.

93
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,337
All right, Barry, listen to me.

94
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,172
You're about to go
through the looking glass.

95
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,907
You're gonna see things that look and feel

96
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:11,042
familiar, but they're not.

97
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,777
Up is down. Black is white,

98
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,812
and do not let yourself
get sucked in emotionally,

99
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:16,814
and good luck.

100
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:18,483
Look, if we're not back

101
00:04:18,485 --> 00:04:20,718
in 48 hours, that means that Zoom has us.

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,787
If that happens,

103
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,022
you have to close the breach.

104
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:25,823
We're not gonna do that.

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,494
You get yourself back here
in one piece, all right?

106
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:30,862
Don't make me come and get you.

107
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:32,997
No.

108
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,367
I wrote this for my parents and Dante.

109
00:04:36,369 --> 00:04:39,771
If I don't come back,
make sure he gets them.

110
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:41,239
Cisco, you're coming back.

111
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,374
Caitlin, please.

112
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:46,511
Okay, I will.

113
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:48,479
Thank you.

114
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:51,916
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

115
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:53,484
Okay.

116
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:59,257
You too, Harry. Snow.

117
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,725
I hope you get your daughter back.

118
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:02,760
I'll make sure you get your son back.

119
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,567
You don't have to do this.

120
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,336
Yeah, I do.

121
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:15,440
Is anybody else feeling panic right now?

122
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,341
I chickened out of bungee
jumping when I was 18,

123
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:19,077
but this is categorically a lot scarier.

124
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,678
Once I turn the speed cannon on,

125
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,081
the three of you will be able
to pass through unharmed,

126
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,349
but Barry, you need to make
sure you keep your speed up.

127
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,350
Mm-hmm.

128
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:28,719
I... I got no spit.

129
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:30,555
- "Jaws."
- I'm not just quoting "Jaws."

130
00:05:30,557 --> 00:05:32,990
I mean my mouth is really dry right now.

131
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:34,358
Do not get distracted

132
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,594
by anything you see along the way.

133
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:38,162
What are we gonna see?

134
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:40,698
Everything.

135
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,567
Do it, Jay.

136
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:51,275
Okay, let's go.

137
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:07,425
Caitlin, look out!

138
00:06:09,062 --> 00:06:11,529
You okay?

139
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:13,131
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

140
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,800
What happened?

141
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:17,869
With the rest of the breaches closed,

142
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,971
the energy surge
to this last remaining breach

143
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:21,706
must have destabilized it.

144
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,541
Well, what does that mean?

145
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:25,409
As long as it's unstable

146
00:06:25,411 --> 00:06:27,478
Barry and Cisco will be trapped over there.

147
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,733
Holy 2001.

148
00:06:48,735 --> 00:06:51,969
I feel like I just opened my third eye.

149
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,873
Oh, my God.

150
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:01,679
Come on.

151
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:03,080
Ow.

152
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,498
Welcome to Earth-2.

153
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,700
Toto, I've got a feeling

154
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:39,968
we're not in Kansas anymore.

155
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,669
This is amazing.

156
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,805
Half these things
are just ideas on our Earth.

157
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:46,040
- Come here.
- I mean...

158
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:48,510
Oh, yeah.

159
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,614
- Ramon.
- What?

160
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:54,082
Not a sightseeing tour.

161
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:55,450
Speak for yourself.

162
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:58,753
We want our grandkids
to know we did cool stuff.

163
00:07:58,755 --> 00:07:59,888
- Dr. Wells.
- Henry.

164
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,955
Welcome back.

165
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:02,123
We weren't expecting you.

166
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,692
- Ahh!
- Yes...

167
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:05,860
I didn't tell anyone

168
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,428
I was coming back.

169
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,630
I thought you might've left town

170
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:09,631
with all that's been happening.

171
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,499
- Right.
- Are your friends okay?

172
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:14,402
Yes, they're... they're fine.

173
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:17,539
They're excitable.

174
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,806
This is, um...

175
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:20,375
Henry Hewitt, lab assistant.

176
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,910
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

177
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,244
And you... um, this is Barry.

178
00:08:23,246 --> 00:08:24,279
This is Cisco.

179
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,613
- I'm Cisco.
- Yeah.

180
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:28,116
And you are just a nice, normal guy.

181
00:08:28,118 --> 00:08:29,450
Okay, um...

182
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:30,818
Dr. Wells, will you and your visitors

183
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,986
be needing the conference room?

184
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:33,121
Not necessary, Henry.

185
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,455
Our visit will be short.

186
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:35,790
- Okay.
- Good to see you.

187
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:38,459
Good to see you, sir.

188
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:39,861
He's a bad guy on Earth-1.

189
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:41,029
He looks just like him.

190
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,737
A reminder that a citywide
curfew has been issued.

191
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:52,840
No unauthorized person
is to be out after 9:00 p.m.

192
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:54,576
A recent increase in Zoom attacks

193
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,744
has led Mayor Snart to extend the curfew.

194
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,880
The curfew was first issued after a series

195
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:00,715
of terror attacks throughout the city...

196
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:02,617
It's worse.

197
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:03,785
It's worse than when I left.

198
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,353
Zoom has turned up his reign of terror.

199
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:06,888
All right, then let's find Zoom fast.

200
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,922
Cisco, do your thing.

201
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:11,125
All right, Zoom...

202
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:14,262
You can run, but you can't hide.

203
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,170
All right, you know what?

204
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:23,871
You guys are crowding my space a little bit.

205
00:09:23,873 --> 00:09:25,440
I can't perform like this
under pressure, okay?

206
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:26,774
If you could just step back
just a little bit,

207
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:27,909
I need to do my thing. All right.

208
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:29,043
- My mojo.
- Yes, all right.

209
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,111
Thank you.

210
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:31,713
Take two...

211
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:33,214
Mm, ah.

212
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,352
All right, Zoom.

213
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:39,554
You can run...

214
00:09:39,556 --> 00:09:40,855
Ramon, what's happening?

215
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:42,790
You know, I don't know, okay?

216
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,659
I can't see anything.
I don't know what's wrong.

217
00:09:44,661 --> 00:09:46,327
Maybe I lost my powers.

218
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:47,595
I didn't lose my powers.

219
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:49,197
Why would you lose your powers?

220
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,798
Oh, here we go, the wavelength trigger's

221
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,767
not responding, but that only happens if...

222
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,135
The frequency is imbalanced.

223
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:55,737
What?

224
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,573
Our Earth vibrates at a
different frequency than yours.

225
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:00,274
Harry, without that frequency...

226
00:10:00,276 --> 00:10:01,376
We're up a creek.

227
00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:02,543
The latest attack

228
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,345
was orchestrated by Zoom,

229
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:06,581
and we understand that citizens

230
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,782
of Central City are scared,

231
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:10,184
but I can assure you the CCPD

232
00:10:10,186 --> 00:10:11,853
- has been working diligently...
- That's me.

233
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:13,454
Yeah, it is.

234
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:15,156
Under the leadership of Detective West.

235
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,725
We will stop Zoom. That's a promise.

236
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,661
"The leadership of Detective West."

237
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:21,129
So Joe's still a cop here.

238
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:24,132
Yeah, but more importantly, I'm still a CSI.

239
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:26,000
I have a plan.

240
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,039
What just happened?

241
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,074
Oh-ho-ho-ho, doppelganger.

242
00:10:33,076 --> 00:10:34,976
Wait, wait, wait, wait, how did I get here?

243
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:37,945
What... who are... who are you?

244
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:40,014
How do you look like me?

245
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:41,482
Allen, what are you doing?

246
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:44,152
Harrison Wells.

247
00:10:45,789 --> 00:10:47,555
The Harrison Wells.

248
00:10:47,557 --> 00:10:49,957
Oh, my God, am I in S.T.A.R. Labs?

249
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,828
Okay, I have no idea what is going on here,

250
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,064
but I've always wanted to meet you.

251
00:10:56,066 --> 00:10:59,500
Your thesis on string phenomenology

252
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:00,935
was revolutionary to me.

253
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,170
- Oh, man.
- I had the magazine

254
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,971
laminated so I could keep it.

255
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:06,107
- I... I just want to emulate...
- This guy's incredible.

256
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:07,975
I won an award for it,
right over there, you see?

257
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,811
Oh, it's beaut...

258
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,412
Wh... wh... what did you do?

259
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:12,580
What's wrong with you?

260
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:13,881
Have you turned into an evil you?

261
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,384
Relax. Just knocked him out.

262
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:19,020
Oh, well, why'd you even
bring him over here?

263
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:20,154
So he could become him.

264
00:11:20,156 --> 00:11:21,823
While you guys work on the goggles,

265
00:11:21,825 --> 00:11:25,126
I will go to CCPD as him
and see if I can figure out

266
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:27,395
what information they have
on Zoom's previous sightings.

267
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,163
We can use those sightings
to triangulate Zoom's hideout.

268
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:30,431
Good. That's a good plan.

269
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,733
Just remember what Jay said, okay?

270
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:33,267
Things here are all sorts of trippy.

271
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,103
Look, it'll be fine.

272
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,175
I can handle it.

273
00:11:41,177 --> 00:11:43,311
It'll be easy.

274
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:54,756
Whoa.

275
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:05,199
Yo, this is crazy.

276
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:07,135
Get your hands off me.

277
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:08,936
Captain?

278
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:12,173
Look, I don't know nothin',

279
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:14,509
so I ain't sayin' nothing'.

280
00:12:14,511 --> 00:12:15,576
Okay.

281
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:16,978
Deadshot, wh...

282
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:19,814
That's not funny, Allen.

283
00:12:19,816 --> 00:12:21,315
I hate that nickname.

284
00:12:21,317 --> 00:12:22,884
Okay, look, I know I'm not...

285
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:24,819
I'm not the best shot
in the department, but...

286
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:27,388
Not the best?

287
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,890
Lawton, you are the worst

288
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:30,491
shot in the entire department.

289
00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:31,826
Hey, why don't you book Singh here,

290
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:33,127
and I'll be in there in a moment?

291
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,162
Whatever you say, partner.

292
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:36,898
- Mm.
- Come on.

293
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, and just for the record,

294
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:41,469
my marksmanship proficiency ratings

295
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:43,104
went up by two points last month.

296
00:12:43,106 --> 00:12:44,405
All right?

297
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:45,706
Two points.

298
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,974
Whoo.

299
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:48,509
Iris.

300
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:53,214
You're Detective West.

301
00:12:53,216 --> 00:12:54,315
The one, the only.

302
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:55,917
Yeah.

303
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,787
Can I see you for a second, CSI Allen?

304
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,856
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

305
00:13:01,858 --> 00:13:03,624
Hmm.

306
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:06,227
Um, what are you doing?

307
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:07,562
What?

308
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:09,597
I think a little office PDA

309
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,098
between husband and wife is okay.

310
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,601
Husband and wife?

311
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:16,304
Yeah, that's what happens
when you do the vows,

312
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:17,572
exchange the rings.

313
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:18,840
Where is your ring?

314
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:19,874
Uh...

315
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:22,276
People should know

316
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:23,578
that you are a taken man.

317
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,615
- That's so weird.
- What's that?

318
00:13:27,617 --> 00:13:29,116
My meta-human alert app.

319
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:30,518
It thinks that you're a meta-human.

320
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,053
That is so weird.

321
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:33,588
Yeah, it must be on the fritz.

322
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,623
Mm, let's go.

323
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:37,158
Where are we going?

324
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,626
Home.

325
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:40,962
Come on.

326
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,473
Where do you people get off

327
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:55,443
robbing Central City's Royal Bank?

328
00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:58,813
This town belongs to Zoom,

329
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:02,850
and those of us he deems worthy
enough to enforce his will.

330
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:05,019
Here.

331
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:06,687
Take it.

332
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,426
Thanks a million.

333
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:15,062
Or should I say two?

334
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:22,270
Hmm.

335
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,839
No.

336
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,142
Wait, please.

337
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:29,143
Don't hurt me.

338
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:30,144
Hurt you?

339
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,780
I just want to give you a kiss.

340
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:48,462
Now what did I tell you
about watching that behind?

341
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,197
I thought that was your job.

342
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,840
Good thing the only man I can kiss

343
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:01,375
is the only one I want to.

344
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:03,110
Just got word some breachers came through.

345
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,912
Ooh, you know my favorite thing

346
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,881
is to kill people from other Earths.

347
00:15:06,883 --> 00:15:08,549
Today's your lucky day.

348
00:15:18,403 --> 00:15:20,770
Oh, gosh.

349
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,944
This is nice.

350
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,947
Our home.

351
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:32,815
I mean, I forgot, I guess.

352
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:40,981
What is wrong with you?

353
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,816
You've been acting weird all day.

354
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:49,389
Um...

355
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:52,225
I'm just not myself, I guess.

356
00:15:53,796 --> 00:15:55,395
Your mom called.

357
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:21,021
Allen residence.

358
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,789
Hello?

359
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,058
- Uh, hello?
- Mom.

360
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,361
Wow, you certainly
took your time calling back.

361
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:34,134
Yeah, um, I'm... I'm sorry about that.

362
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:36,069
Thank you so much

363
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:38,071
for the anniversary tickets to Atlantis.

364
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:40,974
Your dad and I have always wanted to go.

365
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:43,643
Um, I'm... I'm really glad you liked them.

366
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,346
Are you okay?

367
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:49,583
You sound kind of strange.

368
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,017
I'm fine.

369
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:52,152
I'm... I'm...

370
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:53,587
Hey, I know. Maybe I should

371
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:55,889
give the plane tickets to you and Iris.

372
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,624
Nice little romantic getaway.

373
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,926
You two could get started
on giving me a grandchild.

374
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:05,165
No, I want you to use them.

375
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:08,134
I'm really glad to...

376
00:17:08,136 --> 00:17:09,936
hear you happy, Mom.

377
00:17:09,938 --> 00:17:12,572
Aw, I love you, Barry.

378
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:16,109
I love you too.

379
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:18,078
Okay, bye-bye, honey.

380
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:25,118
Baby, what's wrong?

381
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,419
Uh, nothing.

382
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,021
It was, uh...

383
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:30,390
Um, it was just good to talk to my mom.

384
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:33,827
We should get ready, yeah?

385
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:35,829
- Yeah.
- Okay.

386
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:45,972
Where is he?

387
00:17:45,974 --> 00:17:48,008
Where is he?

388
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,843
I don't know. I can't find him anywhere.

389
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,912
Yeah, well, he better show up soon

390
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:53,179
because he's been gone for hours.

391
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:54,614
and we only have so many of those left

392
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,283
before Zoom needs the speed.

393
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:58,518
Oh, you're talking about Barry.

394
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,186
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

395
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:01,655
Don't worry about him. He'll be fine.

396
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:02,956
Who'd you think I was talking about?

397
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,224
I thought you were talking about me.

398
00:18:04,226 --> 00:18:05,625
- You?
- Yeah,

399
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,526
'cause we found Barry's double,

400
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:07,627
so where the hell am I?

401
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,795
You know, I always thought

402
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,564
in another life I was, like,

403
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:12,098
I don't know, like a really

404
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,401
wealthy, famous inventor,

405
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,903
you know, sort of like
the Earth-2 Elon Musk.

406
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:19,906
Only with less RBF, obviously.

407
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:21,341
Here's some advice for you.

408
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,343
How about spending more time
looking for Zoom

409
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:25,645
and less time worrying about
what someone who is not you

410
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,515
is doing with their life?

411
00:18:53,575 --> 00:18:54,808
Whoa.

412
00:18:57,412 --> 00:18:59,112
Joe can sing.

413
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:01,114
He's the best.

414
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:03,183
Right.

415
00:19:14,162 --> 00:19:16,830
Ooh.

416
00:19:16,832 --> 00:19:18,064
Hey, baby.

417
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,165
Hi.

418
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,533
Mm, oh, yeah.

419
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,135
Joe, hey.

420
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:23,737
It's Joseph, Bartholomew.

421
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,538
Pop, be nice.

422
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,806
You too, babe.

423
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:27,807
I'll be right back.

424
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:29,909
Yeah.

425
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:34,714
So you're a singer.

426
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:37,917
So you're still an idiot.

427
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:44,324
Are you upset with me?

428
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:47,293
Or you just... you just don't like me?

429
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:48,495
Have you lost your mind?

430
00:19:48,497 --> 00:19:50,096
Central City's going to hell

431
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:51,831
in a handbasket because this lunatic Zoom

432
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,233
is running around killing folks,

433
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,534
and you got my daughter on the front lines.

434
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:56,269
Wait... wh... me?

435
00:19:56,271 --> 00:20:00,507
It has always been about you, Bartholomew.

436
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,546
You're the most
selfish person I've ever met.

437
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,635
And I'm a musician; we're all selfish.

438
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,170
You wanted to get your PhD

439
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,505
so you could further your career,

440
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,140
and she had to become a police officer

441
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:10,374
to pay your tuition.

442
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,143
We both know

443
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,244
that she'd be safer going back

444
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,412
to write at the newspaper.

445
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:17,548
Oh, Dad, please, stop.

446
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,684
CCPN was an internship.

447
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,019
All I did was get coffee for real writers.

448
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,956
Being a cop like grandpa is what I love.

449
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:28,359
You raised me to be tough, and I am.

450
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,663
Everything's fine,

451
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,699
and we're here to have fun, right?

452
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,967
Right.

453
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:39,503
Everything's great.

454
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,845
How's it going?

455
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:50,915
Uh, slow, which is not a good adjective

456
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,417
when it comes to a speed cannon.

457
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,687
Well, we got another problem.

458
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,690
Why do we always
have to have another problem?

459
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:02,893
You've got to see this.

460
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,229
Somebody call The Flash.

461
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,736
His name is Adam Fells,

462
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:14,238
but he calls himself Geomancer.

463
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,407
So this meta-human is a breacher?

464
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,009
No, Fells died on my Earth.

465
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:19,610
This must be his Earth-1 doppelganger.

466
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,013
Well, at least now, we know his name.

467
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:23,781
Might be a little easier to track him down.

468
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,282
Yeah, but with Barry gone,

469
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,718
how are we gonna stop him
even if we do find him?

470
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,222
Well, Jay, you could shoot
yourself up with that stuff.

471
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:32,556
What was it? Velocity...

472
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,859
- Velocity-6.
- I cannot take V-6.

473
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,727
But it gave you your speed
back long enough to get that

474
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,362
bullet out of Wells, saved his life.

475
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,564
Joe, don't ask me to take Velocity-6 again.

476
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,433
Look, Jay, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do,

477
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,435
but Barry is protecting your world,

478
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:46,170
and our world needs a Flash right about now.

479
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,014
Jay.

480
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:58,582
Caitlin, I like the way you look at me

481
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,552
with warmth and pride, and I'm not...

482
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:02,787
I'm not worthy of those.

483
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,021
Yes, you are.

484
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:06,157
No, I did a terrible thing, Caitlin.

485
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,593
When my world's particle
accelerator went off,

486
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,262
I became a speedster.

487
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:12,997
I became the fastest man alive,

488
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:16,033
only... only it wasn't enough for me.

489
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:19,737
I wasn't... I wasn't fast enough.

490
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,772
So I figured with my scientific background,

491
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,274
I could increase my powers,

492
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,810
and... I did.

493
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:29,413
So you've taken Velocity-6 before?

494
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,749
Yes.

495
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:35,886
But there were some unforeseen side effects.

496
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:38,355
This is why you didn't want Barry to take it

497
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,958
or even know about it.

498
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,327
Zoom never stole your speed.

499
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,963
This is what's making you sick.

500
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,866
Velocity-6 is killing you.

501
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,535
I wasn't lying when I said
that stuff was dangerous.

502
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,540
I've made so many mistakes.

503
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,009
You have something now

504
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,778
that you've never had before.

505
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,079
Me.

506
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:06,550
And I'm gonna figure this out.

507
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:27,705
So can we talk more about
why Joseph doesn't like me?

508
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:29,607
What's there to talk about?

509
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,509
I mean, you can't stand him either.

510
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:33,878
Right.

511
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,680
Look, I can love you both

512
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,716
even if you don't love each other.

513
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:42,987
The meta-human warning app.

514
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,962
Don't stop singing, old man.

515
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,898
That's our song.

516
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,181
So which one of you lounge lizards

517
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:06,616
is in the wrong universe?

518
00:24:06,618 --> 00:24:08,151
Hmm?

519
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,990
Show of hands.

520
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:14,227
Don't be shy.

521
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:16,396
No, no, no.

522
00:24:16,398 --> 00:24:18,331
Hey, handsome.

523
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,333
You got something you want to tell me?

524
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,568
No.

525
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,638
No?

526
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,677
Baby, no one's talking to me.

527
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:31,811
What if I make 'em scream?

528
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:33,246
CCPD!

529
00:24:33,248 --> 00:24:35,315
Everyone get out of here. All right, go, go.

530
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:37,917
You are both under arrest.

531
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,753
Ladies first.

532
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:42,588
Caitlin.

533
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,093
I haven't heard that name in a long time.

534
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:48,795
But that is your name, isn't it?

535
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:50,196
Your real name?

536
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,298
Please, look...

537
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,834
I know you.

538
00:24:54,836 --> 00:24:56,002
Don't do this.

539
00:24:56,004 --> 00:24:59,105
If you knew me at all,

540
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:02,008
you would know that I hate the name Caitlin.

541
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,944
I'm Killer Frost.

542
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:08,815
Go, all right. Go, go!

543
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:12,618
Iris, look out!

544
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:15,955
Dad!

545
00:25:15,957 --> 00:25:17,990
Oh, my God.

546
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:25,965
Well, hello, breacher.

547
00:25:25,967 --> 00:25:27,467
He's a speedster, babe.

548
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:28,701
Oh, I'm shivering.

549
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:30,503
I've been dying to kill The Flash.

550
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:32,004
I don't want to hurt you.

551
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:35,074
Trust me, you won't.

552
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:42,849
Kill him.

553
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,356
Come on.

554
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:53,393
God, this is making me so hot.

555
00:26:18,753 --> 00:26:20,386
This ain't over, breacher!

556
00:26:20,388 --> 00:26:22,388
Barry!

557
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,859
Oh, my God.

558
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:29,629
Barry?

559
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:33,699
Killer Frost and Deathstorm.

560
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:35,368
- You know them?
- More importantly,

561
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,503
they know you now;
they know that you're here.

562
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:40,473
So Caitlin and Ronnie's
doppelgangers are evil?

563
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:42,275
Those are some dope names, though.

564
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:44,343
This was supposed to be
a surgical mission, Allen.

565
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:46,078
Find Zoom's lair. Rescue Jesse.

566
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,014
Get in, get out, not get involved.

567
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:50,917
All right, well, look, I am involved, okay?

568
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:53,052
Joe's in the hospital.
They nearly killed him.

569
00:26:53,054 --> 00:26:54,120
No, he isn't.

570
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:56,155
Joe West, your Joe West,

571
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:57,723
is alive and safe on your Earth,

572
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:59,826
so is Caitlin, so is Iris.

573
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:00,960
These people, Barry,

574
00:27:00,962 --> 00:27:02,161
they're mirror reflections.

575
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:04,063
As far as your life is concerned,

576
00:27:04,065 --> 00:27:05,898
they don't exist.

577
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,734
Killer Frost, Deathstorm,
they know that you're here.

578
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:10,770
Then it's not long before
Zoom does too, and then

579
00:27:10,772 --> 00:27:12,772
my daughter's dead, and that's on you.

580
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:15,775
Jesse still has time, okay?

581
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:17,210
Iris and Joe need me now.

582
00:27:17,212 --> 00:27:18,678
I have to get back to them! She is not Iris!

583
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,979
She is Iris!

584
00:27:19,981 --> 00:27:21,147
Okay, she is to me!

585
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:23,082
No matter what universe I'm in,

586
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:24,450
they are my family!

587
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:25,918
I would think by now you should get

588
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,320
how important family is.

589
00:27:27,322 --> 00:27:28,621
I'm going, Wells.

590
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:30,389
I have to.

591
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,460
Find Zoom.

592
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:44,604
I ran Adam Fells through BCI.

593
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:47,607
Not exactly a model citizen
before he was a meta-human.

594
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,775
Multiple counts of robbery and assault.

595
00:27:49,777 --> 00:27:51,410
Well, if he thinks he's gonna use my city

596
00:27:51,412 --> 00:27:54,247
for a steel cage death match with The Flash,

597
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:55,781
he's got another thing coming.

598
00:27:56,784 --> 00:27:58,351
Hey, what are you doing here?

599
00:27:58,353 --> 00:28:00,353
Wait, were we supposed
to meet up or something?

600
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:02,288
No, I was... I was just nearby.

601
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,530
Everybody okay?

602
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:11,697
Fells has been spotted.

603
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:13,165
Pasko and Fourth.

604
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:15,801
Go.

605
00:28:15,803 --> 00:28:18,337
I got to go, son.

606
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,505
Joe...

607
00:28:36,491 --> 00:28:38,558
Dad, are you okay?

608
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:44,256
Damn meta-humans.

609
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:48,994
Only thing I hate more...

610
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,629
is hospitals.

611
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:55,333
Are you okay?

612
00:28:55,335 --> 00:28:57,903
Yeah.

613
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,137
Just worried about you.

614
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,707
There's a first.

615
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:07,379
Baby.

616
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:09,781
Yeah, yeah.

617
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,655
You ever notice every time

618
00:29:16,657 --> 00:29:18,990
just before I do a number,

619
00:29:18,992 --> 00:29:20,659
I close my eyes for a hot second

620
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:21,927
and I take a deep breath?

621
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:25,430
You ever wonder what I was doing?

622
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,832
Trying to remember the lyrics?

623
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:33,805
I say a little mantra to myself

624
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,274
every time before I sing.

625
00:29:38,178 --> 00:29:39,578
"This one is for Iris.

626
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,416
My baby girl."

627
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:51,656
Every song's for you, baby.

628
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:54,626
Every single one.

629
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,528
Dad, don't talk like this, okay?

630
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,297
Wh... B... Barry.

631
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:01,499
Yeah?

632
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:08,173
You take care of her.

633
00:30:08,175 --> 00:30:10,175
Mm.

634
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:13,645
Dad?

635
00:30:13,647 --> 00:30:16,147
Dad? Dad? Nurse!

636
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:17,315
Doctor! Nurse!

637
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,817
Dad!

638
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:19,784
Iris.

639
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:26,524
No, no, no!

640
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:29,160
No! No!

641
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:30,595
It's okay.

642
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:45,286
Aww, darn it.

643
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:48,227
You don't have to do this, Lawton.

644
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:49,944
We're partners, right?

645
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:51,445
You've always had my back,

646
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:52,813
and I've got yours.

647
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:57,351
Oh, Iris.

648
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:00,087
- Do I know you?
- Does she know me?

649
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:03,524
Uh, this is my good friend, Cisco Ramon.

650
00:31:03,526 --> 00:31:06,427
- Good friend?
- Yeah.

651
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:08,429
Cisco works at S.T.A.R. Labs,

652
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:11,232
and he has built a weapon
that he believes we can use

653
00:31:11,234 --> 00:31:13,534
to neutralize, um, Killer Frost's powers.

654
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:14,802
Great, thanks.

655
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:16,037
I'll take it.

656
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:20,741
Uh, please, I should really take this.

657
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:22,210
All right.

658
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:24,111
One of my snitches gave me a lead

659
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:25,947
on Killer Frost and Deathstorm's location.

660
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:27,215
We're gonna bring them in.

661
00:31:27,217 --> 00:31:29,483
Okay, um, I'm coming with you, Iris.

662
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:31,586
No. Barry, I just lost my father.

663
00:31:31,588 --> 00:31:33,287
I cannot lose my husband too.

664
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:36,023
All right, well, Cisco's
the only one that knows

665
00:31:36,025 --> 00:31:37,992
how to operate the device,
so you have to take him.

666
00:31:37,994 --> 00:31:40,428
I can't put a civilian in harm's way.

667
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,129
Look, I've seen fire, and I've seen rain.

668
00:31:42,131 --> 00:31:47,468
I can handle myself, okay, Mrs. West-Allen.

669
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:55,476
I love you.

670
00:31:58,615 --> 00:32:00,081
I love you too.

671
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,682
Lawton, let's move.

672
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:03,851
Yeah, uh...

673
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:10,157
We need to work on finding Jesse.

674
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,692
Are you sure this is what
you want to be doing?

675
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:12,927
I am, all right?

676
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:14,762
Right now, we have to help Iris.

677
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:16,297
Just make sure no one else gets hurt.

678
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,452
CCPD! It's over, Fells!

679
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:40,755
No offense to you boys in blue,

680
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:42,523
but I'm waiting on the man in red.

681
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,091
You better hope The Flash doesn't show up,

682
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:45,159
or you're finished.

683
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:46,560
See, that's funny.

684
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:48,195
I don't think he will show.

685
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:50,865
I've been causing tremors for days

686
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,833
and no sign of him.

687
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:55,569
I think he's gone.

688
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:58,973
What is it they say in boxing?

689
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:02,009
Let's get ready to rumble.

690
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,117
What the...

691
00:33:12,755 --> 00:33:14,755
I heard you were looking for The Flash.

692
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:16,691
Looks like the Velocity-7 is working.

693
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:18,359
Now, go get him.

694
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:24,965
That's a new one.

695
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:26,901
Is that all you have?

696
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:31,138
You don't ever want to see all I have.

697
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,979
The Velocity-7's wearing off.

698
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,917
You've heard what an eight
on the Richter scale

699
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,019
can do to a city.

700
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:48,723
Imagine what it's gonna do to your skull.

701
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:01,335
You hurt?

702
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:03,237
My pride

703
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,939
and my body.

704
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,174
Pride and my body.

705
00:34:20,957 --> 00:34:23,324
You really sure this is the place?

706
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:26,694
Maybe you should stay in the car, Lawton.

707
00:34:26,696 --> 00:34:29,830
Look alive, gents.

708
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:44,745
Hey, maybe... maybe your snitch was wrong.

709
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:46,981
I mean, maybe they're not even here.

710
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:55,689
No, they're here.

711
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:03,464
You didn't knock.

712
00:35:03,466 --> 00:35:05,032
How rude.

713
00:35:08,137 --> 00:35:09,703
Drop 'em.

714
00:35:18,948 --> 00:35:21,182
Ronnie.

715
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:23,884
Is Martin Stein in there?

716
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:26,153
Oh, I haven't let him out in years.

717
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,922
Doesn't talk much anymore.

718
00:35:29,158 --> 00:35:30,991
You killed my father, you evil bitch.

719
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:32,393
He shouldn't have palled around

720
00:35:32,395 --> 00:35:33,461
with a breacher.

721
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:34,528
That's a big no-no as far

722
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,363
as Zoom's concerned.

723
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:38,098
I can't believe you two work for Zoom.

724
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,969
No, they work for me.

725
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:43,504
I work for Zoom.

726
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:51,445
Who the hell are you?

727
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,950
Well, that's funny.

728
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:59,053
I was just gonna ask you the same thing.

729
00:36:02,325 --> 00:36:04,358
- Doppel...
- Ganger.

730
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:11,313
What the hell is going on here?

731
00:36:11,681 --> 00:36:13,047
Are you two related to each other?

732
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,464
Oh, I knew there was another me here.

733
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,763
And I knew you were coming, Cisco,

734
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:18,664
even before you entered the breach

735
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:20,166
and set foot on this world.

736
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:24,170
See, we're all connected...

737
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,772
Francisco.

738
00:36:25,774 --> 00:36:27,673
My name is Vibe.

739
00:36:27,675 --> 00:36:30,243
Reverb.

740
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,912
Actually not the worst name
you could've come up with,

741
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:34,947
but not the best.

742
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:39,619
I've been watching you, Vibe,

743
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:42,655
and I have to say
I am extremely disappointed.

744
00:36:42,657 --> 00:36:44,524
Yeah, I know the feeling.

745
00:36:44,526 --> 00:36:46,225
I'm not sure what's worse,

746
00:36:46,227 --> 00:36:47,527
the fact that you're part of Zoom's gang,

747
00:36:47,529 --> 00:36:49,595
or that weird samurai situation

748
00:36:49,597 --> 00:36:51,130
you got going on on the top
of your head there.

749
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:54,000
Listen to this.

750
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:56,803
What if Zoom

751
00:36:56,805 --> 00:36:58,738
wasn't running the show anymore?

752
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,873
What do you mean?

753
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:03,009
You don't even know how powerful you are.

754
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:04,977
All you use your powers for

755
00:37:04,979 --> 00:37:07,113
are these cheap parlor tricks

756
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:11,217
when you... you could be a god.

757
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:13,786
We could be gods.

758
00:37:19,727 --> 00:37:22,195
Are you Cloud City Vadering me right now?

759
00:37:22,197 --> 00:37:25,865
Are you out of your mind?

760
00:37:25,867 --> 00:37:29,035
Let's turn them over to Zoom.

761
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,536
Speak to me like that again,

762
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:32,538
and I will shatter
your entire nervous system

763
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,507
without breaking a sweat.

764
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:41,214
So, Vibe...

765
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:44,016
Do you want to run Central City?

766
00:37:44,018 --> 00:37:45,751
What do you say?

767
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:50,590
I say...

768
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:52,358
Flash, save us!

769
00:37:56,598 --> 00:37:58,064
Hey, that didn't hurt you, did it?

770
00:37:58,066 --> 00:37:59,365
- No. Why would it?
- I don't know.

771
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:00,933
And who the hell are you?

772
00:38:00,935 --> 00:38:03,035
Look, Detective,
just get out of here, all right?

773
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:04,670
No, not without them.

774
00:38:15,316 --> 00:38:17,149
Stay here!

775
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:20,820
Round two.

776
00:38:22,257 --> 00:38:24,357
Look, mirror-mirror, I already told you

777
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,769
I'm not going to the dark side with you.

778
00:38:34,113 --> 00:38:35,412
You're a rotten shot.

779
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,851
I'm not.

780
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:44,388
Are you telling me I can do that?

781
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,322
I can show you.

782
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:54,464
No!

783
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,142
Stop, both of you!

784
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:06,610
Zoom wanted him alive.

785
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:08,211
You know what Zoom will do

786
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,646
if you don't obey him.

787
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:15,352
No!

788
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,254
That.

789
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:24,127
What did I say you should do

790
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:26,964
if you encountered a speedster?

791
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:29,666
Leave him unharmed.

792
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:37,007
Does this look unharmed to you?

793
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:53,757
I'm happy to see at least one of you

794
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,727
knows their place.

795
00:40:02,735 --> 00:40:04,101
Barry!

796
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:07,637
No.

797
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:11,575
No.

798
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:25,856
Sorry.

799
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:28,058
Did I forget to say this might sting?

800
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,460
It's not my first road rash.

801
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,696
I'm a speedster, remember?

802
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:35,365
You made sure no one will forget that today.

803
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:37,134
Thanks to you.

804
00:40:37,136 --> 00:40:39,002
The Velocity-7 held up pretty well.

805
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,404
Moving on to Velocity-8.

806
00:40:40,406 --> 00:40:43,240
I'm gonna figure it out, I swear.

807
00:40:43,242 --> 00:40:46,343
I just need you to figure out
how to re-stabilize the breach.

808
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:49,746
Barry, Cisco, and Wells
still have 24 hours to go.

809
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:52,182
So we have one day,

810
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:54,284
or they could be stuck there forever.

811
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:27,584
Jesse. Jesse!

812
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:29,920
Hey. I'm here with your dad!

813
00:41:29,922 --> 00:41:31,621
We're gonna get you out of here, all right?

814
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:33,256
I promise.

815
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,794
It's not wise

816
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:44,000
to make promises you can't keep, Flash.

817
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,170
Look around.

818
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:53,310
This is the last place

819
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:56,513
you'll ever see.

820
