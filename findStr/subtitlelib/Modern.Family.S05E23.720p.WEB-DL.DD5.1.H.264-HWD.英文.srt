1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,910
Good morning, almost husband!

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:06,320
Good morning, almost...

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,920
Oh, calm down.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,010
This can't be the first time

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,960
you woke up with another men in your bedroom.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,820
Happy wedding day!

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,130
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,370
You pay for a full-service wedding,

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,510
you get our full packages.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,480
Oh, close, honey, so close.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,740
- And we are crossing... - We're crossing

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,590
and trays down.

13
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,830
Napkin.

14
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,410
Relax. Enjoy.

15
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,060
The car will pick you up at 4:00

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,330
to whisk you away to your beautiful hilltop wedding.

17
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,900
How's the weather?

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,250
I had a dream it rained on everyone.

19
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,070
Dry as a bone.

20
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,100
The only thing it will be raining tonight is men.

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,310
We really need it.

22
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,730
Has anyone heard from Sal?

23
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,420
No.

24
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,680
And I will never understand

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,060
why you asked that boozy us-hag to

26
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,350
officiate your wedding.

27
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,620
We didn't exactly ask Sal.

28
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,690
Sal...

29
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,890
...we have something very important to talk to you about.

30
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,910
Yeah, we hope that maybe you would be open to the idea --

31
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,490
Yes! I will totally officiate your wedding!

32
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,510
Oh, my drinks!

33
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,180

38
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,450
Hey, best man.

39
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,010
Hello, blushing bride.

40
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,670
I feel like I should hate that more.

41
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,730
Yeah, I think I might go with "Best person."

42
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,480
Anyway, I'm just calling

43
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,420
to see how you're doing.

44
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,340
I'm great.

45
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,380
Really?

46
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,140
I-I-- is this about mom again?

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,920
I told you -- I'm fine.

48
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,680
My mother can't come to the wedding.

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,170
She was at a yoga retreat,

50
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,670
and she fell out of a warrior pose,

51
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,860
and she broke her hip.

52
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,430
Should we consider the possibility

53
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,370
that someone pushed her?

54
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,710
Cam, please.

55
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,340
They were a bunch of peace-loving hippies

56
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,210
who spent two weeks in the rainforest with my mother.

57
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,230
Of course someone pushed her.

58
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,010
I'm actually relieved she's not coming.

59
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,040
She's given me the gift

60
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,320
of a crazy-free wedding.

61
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,080
I know. I was just a little sad for you.

62
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,220
Mom's a no-show,

63
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,100
and you and dad are hardly even speaking.

64
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,370
Enough about Dad.

65
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,250
He doesn't get gay weddings,

66
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,360
and I don't get track suits as casualwear.

67
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,570
Can we please talk about something happy,

68
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,650
like my honeymoon in Mexico?

69
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,280
Oh, yeah, you're gonna want to take a look at the weather channel.

70
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,200
Hilarious.

71
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:14,710
Love you.

72
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,700
Love you, too.

73
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,660
You're gonna get the gift today, right?

74
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,850
Don't we have a year to do that?

75
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,780
No, I have a husband to do that.

76
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,440
They fell in love with

77
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,380
this very specific turquoise Italian glass bowl.

78
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,070
I looked everywhere, finally found one,

79
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,590
and we're not going to that wedding without it.

80
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,390
Wait. I-I thought you were taking me to the eye doctor.

81
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,990
They said I'm not supposed to drive myself home.

82
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,970
No, no, no, no.

83
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,830
I'm picking up Luke from his wilderness trip.

84
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,020
Alex can take you.

85
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,860
That's a bummer.

86
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,100
Aww, dad, I'm touched.

87
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,340
No, not because of you. I'd just rather pick up Luke.

88
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,150
Than go to the eye doctor.

89
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,130
I-I love spending time with you.

90
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,580
Don't worry -- you're fun.

91
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,440
My dad would never admit this,

92
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,230
but when he wants fun,

93
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,770
he goes straight to Luke.

94
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,090
They have a weird connection.

95
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,700
They're like Batman and Robin.

96
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,210
Dad and I are more like

97
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,270
Batman and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

98
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,020
Honey, don't be like that.

99
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,450
You're super fun!

100
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,550
You sure I can't get Luke?

101
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,290
I heard that!

102
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,520
Let's do this!

103
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,040
Hello.

104
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,280
Hey, mom. Gloria wants to know

105
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,670
if she can do your hair and makeup last

106
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,110
after me and Cam's mom.

107
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,510
It's fine.

108
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,930
Something about Luke -- I've lost interest.

109
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,650
Okay, love you. Bye!

110
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,050
Damn, this is the best cup of coffee I ever had.

111
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,890
Manny roasts his own beans every friday night.

112
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,370
That kid's gonna be roasting his own beans for a long time,

113
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,430
if you know what I mean.

114
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,440
Can I just say thank you again for letting us stay here?

115
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,870
You have thanked us enough with that big bag of deer meat.

116
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,780
Hey, mom.

117
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,600
Can you see this?

118
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,520
What pimple?

119
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,330
I knew it.

120
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,680
I can't go looking like this.

121
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,290
Weddings are where you meet girls.

122
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,570
Not at this one.

123
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,460
- Well, we better be going. - Yeah.

124
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,130
Have a great spa day.

125
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,570
Men don't have spa days.

126
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,260
We're just going to the club, taking a steam,

127
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,830
having a couple of rubdowns.

128
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,940
Do they serve cucumber water at that place?

129
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,380
Sometimes they do a strawberry-basil mix.

130
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,320
- Merle? - Yes, ma'am?

131
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,860
Be back in time for me to do your tie.

132
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,950
Uh, yes, ma'am.

133
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,670
I'm so sorry you had to see that.

134
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,470
See what?

135
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,490
The way we just snapped at each other.

136
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,640
Are you joking?

137
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,970
Obviously, Merle and I are going through a heck of a rough patch.

138
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,130
If I talked to Jay that nice,

139
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,900
he would think I'm cheating on him.

140
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,240
Mrs. P...

141
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,460
...my darn taxi never came.

142
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,340
I'm gonna miss my flight.

143
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,160
No.

144
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,770
I just --

145
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,050
I don't want to deal with this right now

146
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,020
'cause I'm already so scared of flying.

147
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,180
I just hate everything about it --

148
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,420
Except for the food.

149
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,330
I don't understand how they get such bold flavors

150
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,480
out of that tiny kitchen.

151
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,710
Haley, can you drive Andy to the airport, please?

152
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,920
She doesn't want to do that.

153
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,540
Aww, you get me.

154
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,390
Haley.

155
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,460
I don't have a car. I got dropped off.

156
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,240
I guess we can take my car.

157
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,370
That's settled. Go.

158
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,280
Fine.

159
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,340
Okay.

160
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,340
We really need to hurry.

161
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,820
Relax. We'll get there.

162
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,720
You just worry about

163
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,190
being strapped in a giant metal tube

164
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,670
30,000 feet in the air.

165
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,550
That's right -- I heard.

166
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,330
- Hey. - What?

167
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,450
I just thought of something.

168
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,320
What's going on with my hair today?

169
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,780
Daddy's going to do it up really pretty with flowers.

170
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,400
Not you, right?

171
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,570
No, other daddy.

172
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,690
Oh, thank god.

173
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,410
Mitchell, this is not my tuxedo!

174
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,680
They gave me the wrong order!

175
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,370
And the fuchsia gown didn't tip you off?

176
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,440
I have like nine shirts this color.

177
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,470
I'm wearing a shirt this color.

178
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,870
Okay, deep breaths. Deep breaths.

179
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,750
We have plenty of time to go to the dry-cleaner.

180
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,360
We knew that there would be a bump today,

181
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,210
and here it is. We're getting it done early.

182
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,310
This is our bump.

183
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,240
Okay, okay, so this is our bump.

184
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,220
I can't handle this.

185
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,980
We're getting married in five hours,

186
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,790
I don't have my perfectly tailored tux.

187
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,200
I can't just go buy something off the rack.

188
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,780
I'm not Cindy Crawford.

189
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,720
Why a woman?

190
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,640
I'm just wondering.

191
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,610
What are we gonna do?

192
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,670
We could eat.

193
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,130
We just need to get in touch with the owner.

194
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,670
Y-you, uh, you know his name, right?

195
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,950
It's...Aziz something? .

196
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,800
Oh, oh it's -- it's -- uh, no, it's A-Amir.

197
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,330
It's -- it's not amir, no.

198
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,800
Oh, no, it's, uh, Ahmad.

199
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,480
It's Achmed.

200
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,610
No. Oh, it's on the ticket.

201
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,870
Now I'm just feeling racist.

202
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,070
- What is it? - Here it is.

203
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,850
- It's... - Jerry.

204
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,720
- J-- oh, Jerry. - Amari.

205
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,770
Jerry Amari.

206
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,980
There you go.

207
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,550
Can you see better in here?

208
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,070
A little, but those drops are really hanging on.

209
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,730
I'm like Han Solo right when he came out of the carbonite.

210
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,240
Really? Nothing?

211
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,410
I get it. It's "Star Trek."

212
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,540
You're breaking my heart.

213
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,950
Save it for Luke. He'll love that.

214
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,140
Can we just get the gift and get out of here?

215
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,340
Right, but first things first.

216
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,400
Let's put on some funny hats,

217
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,340
act like they're not there,

218
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,010
and then walk around all serious.

219
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,270
What's the point of this?

220
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,760
That's good. You're nailing it.

221
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,120
Hey, honey.

222
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,300
How was the eye exam?

223
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,880
Great.

224
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,590
I can barely see.

225
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,790
I'm wearing giant sunglasses and a girly hat.

226
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,170
Alex and I are having a blast.

227
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,440
But you got the gift, right?

228
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,740
That's what people tell me.

229
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,010
Honey, the bowl.

230
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,060
I have the bowl.

231
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,050
It's beautiful.

232
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,380
I'll -- I'll see you at home.

233
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,320
Hey, here's a thought --

234
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,790
Now that you told mom you got the bowl,

235
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,070
how about we actually go get it?

236
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,420
Yes, no more fooling around.

237
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,510
Let's go get the bowl.

238
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,460
Oh, right after we find out our sleep number.

239
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,060
There's my guy.

240
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,760
I thought dad was picking me up.

241
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,310
Oh. I missed you, too.

242
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,180
Come here.

243
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,020
So, did you have fun?

244
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,920
Yeah.

245
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,110
What was your favorite thing?

246
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,200
I don't remember.

247
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,150
It was yesterday.

248
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,650
Hot dogs. Can we go now?

249
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,310
Honey, I feel bad that you have to leave early.

250
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,550
What are you missing today?

251
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,670
Boating.

252
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,130
Well, I mean, we have a little time.

253
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,790
You don't mind waiting in the car?

254
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,670
So, Cam tells me you and Mitch had a little dust-up.

255
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,530
Yeah.

256
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,250
A couple of weeks ago.

257
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,280
That kid can hold a grudge.

258
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,330
A little uncomfortable about that wedding, are you?

259
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,050
Well, you know what I'm feeling, right?

260
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,540
I'd like to think I've evolved on the subject.

261
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,120
We got a couple of lesbo swans in the pond.

262
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,700
They seem pretty happy.

263
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,640
Hey, Jay.

264
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,120
Hey, Howard, Larry.

265
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,150
This is my, uh...

266
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,490
This is my friend Merle, and he's visiting from Missouri.

267
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,710
Ooh, the "Show me" state.

268
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,180
Don't say that in here!

269
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,290
So, what brings you to town, Merle?

270
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,800
Well, uh, my -- our --

271
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,680
Jay's and my...kids are getting married today.

272
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,400
Congratulations.

273
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,540
Isn't that nice?

274
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,450
Father of the bride, father of the groom

275
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,510
taking a steam together the day of the wedding.

276
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,790
Yeah, something like that.

277
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,510
The day my son got married -- piece of cake.

278
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,050
But the day I lost my little girl --

279
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,160
Ohh, that wrecked me.

280
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,620
So, which one of you has to suffer through that today?

281
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,330
You know what? It's too hot in here.

282
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,240
- Yeah. - Let's go.

283
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,530
Mm-hmm. Real evolved.

284
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,150
Your swans would be ashamed.

285
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,360
Well, I guess I first noticed it after Pameron moved out,

286
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,730
and Merle and I just started

287
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,680
sniping at each other.

288
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,780
Yeah, like that bloodbath this morning?

289
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,350
Ohh. Again, I am so sorry.

290
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:04,470
But Merle is not the type you can talk to about things.

291
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,740
I mean, the man's had a toothpick in his mouth

292
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,110
our whole marriage, and I can't say a word.

293
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,930
No, you can't sit on your feelings.

294
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,370
You will explode!

295
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,590
I have, like, 10 little explosions every day,

296
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,270
so I don't have the big one.

297
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,810
The women in my family --

298
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,760
sometimes, they shoot their husbands.

299
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,790
Well, we've had 48...good years.

300
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,120
I...guess we're just gonna run out the clock.

301
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,030
No!

302
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,890
You're still...

303
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,510
You have...

304
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,260
That is bad attitude!

305
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,230
You have to tell Merle what is bothering you.

306
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,190
Oh, he doesn't want to hear all that.

307
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,750
He gets all closed off and macho.

308
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,000
You're ticklin' my piggies.

309
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,190
You get used to that.

310
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,390
It's a shame Mitchell's mother couldn't make it to the wedding.

311
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,370
For who?

312
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:58,720
Mm, things still rough between the two of you?

313
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,950
Merle, things have always been rough.

314
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,440
That woman never stopped complaining.

315
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,200
Finding the strength to leave Dede is the hardest thing I ever did,

316
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,830
but the best decision I ever made.

317
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,890
Well, you sure made a score with that Gloria.

318
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,330
Big-time.

319
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,500
I bet you landed her

320
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,530
before she got a gander at those hooves of yours.

321
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,810
You're welcome, by the way.

322
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,190
So, what are you gonna do in Utah?

323
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,680
Well, me and my girlfriend

324
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,370
haven't seen each other in a while,

325
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,830
So we're gonna be like a couple of bunny rabbits...

326
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,790
just hopping all over town.

327
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
Is this her?

328
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,860
Yep, that's my Beth.

329
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,770
Huh. She's pretty.

330
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,330
Yeah. She's the most beautiful creature, inside and out.

331
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm just the luckiest guy ever to get to love her.

332
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,680
Okay, she may be real,

333
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,740
but no way you are.

334
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,750
Who talks like that?

335
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,560
You know, I hate when you say things like that

336
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,000
because you are funny, and you are pretty,

337
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,860
and you are smart and in an original way,

338
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,740
so why shouldn't a guy feel lucky to love you?

339
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,730
Shut up. Be normal.

340
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,690
- Hey, my phone just buzzed. Can you read it? - Yeah.

341
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,410
I don't want to put our lives at risk.

342
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,370
It's, uh, it's from the airline.

343
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,280
Your flight's delayed three hours.

344
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,830
- Three hours?! - Yeah.

345
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,940
Ohh! Jinkies!

346
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,470
I guess we can just drop me off at a coffee shop,

347
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,970
and I can take a cab from there.

348
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,850
Okay.

349
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,610
Actually, I really need to wake up.

350
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,720
Maybe I'll grab a coffee with you, if you don't mind.

351
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,680
Please.

352
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,710
The more I talk to people,

353
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,760
the less I imagine plummeting to my death

354
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,310
in a fiery spiral of screaming and crying.

355
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,930
Pretty dark for someone who just said "Jinkies."

356
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,550
Well, I guess we have

357
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,790
different definitions of "Emergency," then.

358
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,940
You know, I'm just gonna say it --

359
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,130
911 dispatchers have a little bit of attitude.

360
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,940
Well, you requested a S.W.A.T. Team.

361
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,310
Is anybody else hungry?

362
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,680
Mitchell! Mitchell!

363
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,890
Look at this.

364
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,900
Do you think you could fit in there?

365
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,030
I'm not doing that.

366
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,650
Then what am I gonna wear to our wedding --

367
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,820
My black funeral suit?

368
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,200
Is that the tone you want to set?

369
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,530
You wore it to one funeral.

370
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,060
And you didn't even know Bea Arthur.

371
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,360
- I felt like I did. - I know.

372
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,040
It's Pepper. He'll know what to do.

373
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,930
Yes. Pepper. Disaster.

374
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,270
It's not a disaster. It's just a wildfire.

375
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,890
And it's most certainly not going to burn down your wedding.

376
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,980
- What?! - What?

377
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,660
There's a wildfire near the venue.

378
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,610
No!

379
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,770
Yes, but it's fine.

380
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,320
Ronaldo is going to text-blast the guest list,

381
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,370
tell them the wedding is being moved from 5:00 to 1:00.

382
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,520
Oh, my god!

383
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,830
Don't panic.

384
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,140
Would somebody please turn off that wretched waterfall?!

385
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,200
Kill the waterfall immediately!

386
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,870
The fire is already 28% contained.

387
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,030
That doesn't sound like a lot.

388
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,530
Just get dressed and look pretty.

389
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,050
I'm going to send the car for you in one hour.

390
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,150
Have you lost your mind?!

391
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,490
Go! You disgust me!

392
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,350
Go!

393
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,210
Okay.

394
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,470
Now what are we gonna do?

395
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,700
No, I guess maybe --

396
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,960
No, th-- Cam, there's no way I could fit through there.

397
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,060
You two exhaust me.

398
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,080
What?

399
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,930
We have to be there in an hour!

400
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,820
I can't go like this!

401
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,930
Look at me!

402
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,640
I hate you.

403
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,790
Prepare yourself for the best burger of your life.

404
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,430
We got to go.

405
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,660
Maybe we should try on more hats.

406
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,820
Do you think we have time?

407
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,170
It's not working!

408
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,910
And there's no oar?

409
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,820
We are literally up a creek without a paddle?

410
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,030
Okay, Lily, Lily!

411
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,480
Okay, you're gonna press the green button to start it,

412
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,980
and then you're gonna look for number 9-1-3.

413
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,970
And then, when you see it go by,

414
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,390
you press the red button to stop it, okay?

415
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,650
Okay.

416
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,110
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

417
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,950
I get us into these situations, and I freak,

418
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,520
and then you always fix the problem.

419
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,090
Well, now, we each have our own gifts.

420
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,980
It's just it's easier for me

421
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,340
to stay calm in the face of --

422
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,580
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, oh!

423
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,750
- Lily, Daddies coming for you! - Oh, my god!

424
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,320
Okay, now, Lily, press the red button!

425
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,780
I'm breaking the window!

426
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,800
Put that down!

427
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,060
Thank god you're here.

428
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,520
Are you breaking into my store?

429
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,070
Uh, no.

430
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,420
Why would you even say that?

431
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,090
My alarm went off.

432
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,840
Oh, well, okay, that is a coincidence

433
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,320
Because his tuxedo is in there,

434
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,190
and we're getting married in an hour.

435
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,070
You are totally saving us.

436
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,660
You know, I freak out at situations like this,

437
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,440
which forces him to fix the problem,

438
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,150
- You know? - I do. I do.

439
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,410
So, I'm over here, freaking out,

440
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:39,480
while he's somewhere else, fixing the problem.

441
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,900
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

442
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,170
Well, maybe that's a good thing, you know --

443
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,190
the yin, the yang?

444
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,330
Yeah, whatever, Jerry.

445
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,010
Where'd she come from?

446
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,770
Oh, oh, because she doesn't look like us?

447
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,630
- That's offensive. - Oh, Jerry.

448
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,610
What are we going to do?

449
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,910
I know how to get up there.

450
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,010
- I'm blind. - Follow me.

451
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,540
- Oh, I'm not doing that. - Alex!

452
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,680
Excuse me, could someone help me to find the back of the line?

453
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,060
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

454
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,600
- Go right here.  - Are you sure?

455
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,540
Can I help you?

456
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,720
Yes, picking up for Dunphy.

457
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,370
It's on hold, I believe.

458
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,930
Beautiful day, huh? I was told.

459
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,530
Here we go. Credit card?

460
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,660
Uh, just to be sure -- that is turquoise, right?

461
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,950
Because my wife said it also comes in emerald.

462
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:32,370
Yes. Sir, it's a very long line.

463
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,960
Okay. Um, can I have it for one second?

464
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,150
Thank you.

465
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,880
Yep, that doesn't feel like turquoise.

466
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,540
You can feel color? You got to be kidding me.

467
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,360
When you lose one sense,

468
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,740
all your other senses become heightened.

469
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,650
That's why you sound so loud and judge-y to me.

470
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,830
My mistake, sir.

471
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,730
- I'll be right back. - Okay.

472
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,810
Here it is.

473
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,610
Hey, he's messing with the blind guy.

474
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,120
Thank you -- wherever you are.

475
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,700
I don't think he's really blind.

476
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,590
Excuse me.

477
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,790
My father suffered methanol poisoning

478
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,840
on a humanitarian mission in Honduras

479
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,150
resulting in permanent neurological dysfunction

480
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,830
and irreversible blindness.

481
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,140
It's been hard enough on our family

482
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,040
without people like you making it worse.

483
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,190
If he feels it's not the bowl,

484
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,980
it's not the bowl.

485
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,400
I'm so sorry.

486
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,900
I'll check on the turquoise.

487
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,630
Okay, that was kind of fun.

488
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,550
I'm winking at you right now.

489
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,430
Ohh, this is not working.

490
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,340
We are never gonna get there on time,

491
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,320
and I am the best person.

492
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,500
Oh, god!

493
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,980
I think I just broke a nail on a turtle.

494
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,060
You're the one who wanted to come out here.

495
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,150
Yes, I did,

496
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,630
because I wanted to spend some time with my son.

497
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,110
You've --

498
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,750
You've been pushing me away so much lately,

499
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,530
And I don't want you to grow up to be the kind of kid

500
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,760
who doesn't care if his mom shows up at his wedding.

501
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,070
What are you talking about?

502
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,760
Nana isn't coming today, and Mitchell's relieved.

503
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,060
I'd be really sad if you missed my wedding.

504
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,330
Really? You promise?

505
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,410
Totally. And so would Kate.

506
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,140
Who's Kate?

507
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,950
Upton -- my wife, your daughter-in-law.

508
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,130
Get on board.

509
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:09,910
Come on.

510
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,430
Then what has been going on with you recently?

511
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,940
You've been so moody.

512
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,270
I'm sorry, but I'm sick of going school

513
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,300
and hearing teachers say,

514
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,150
"You're Alex Dunphy's brother?

515
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Really?" Like I'm an idiot.

516
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,700
Oh, honey, you're not an idiot.

517
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,490
I forgot the paddle

518
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,230
even though we just learned the boating checklist yesterday.

519
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,820
Alex would never do that.

520
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,410
And if she did, she'd probably, like --

521
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,480
I don't know --

522
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,270
use this fishing rod to cast out and hook us on the shore

523
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,150
because "I'm so smart."

524
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,800
And then she'd pull us in

525
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,310
because everything she does always works.

526
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,180
Oh, my god. It's working. It's working!

527
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,570
Figures. Alex.

528
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:49,690
Don't move.

529
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,280
The lighting is really cool right now.

530
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,670
Wh are you doing? Don't smile.

531
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,980
Why? It's my favorite thing.

532
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,930
No, really, be serious.

533
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,000
Look out the window.

534
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:02,260
Look.

535
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,440
That is honestly the best photo anyone's ever taken of me.

536
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,250
Thank you.

537
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,990
You mind if I send a copy to Beth?

538
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,940
Andy, um...

539
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,130
When I read the text about your flight,

540
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,380
I saw the text from Beth telling you not to come.

541
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,560
Yeah, she doesn't mean that.

542
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,350
She said, "It's over."

543
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,590
That can mean a lot of different things.

544
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,430
Your phone's buzzing again.

545
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,450
Oh, my god. The wedding got moved up.

546
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,490
I have to go.

547
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Andy, are you sure about getting on that plane?

548
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,990
Yeah, yeah. I-I'm fine.

549
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,140
You know, she does this every once in a while.

550
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,500
She just likes the drama.

551
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,040
- But I -- okay. - Haley,

552
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,430
I appreciate your concern -- I really do --

553
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,400
But I've been in this relationship off and on for eight years,

554
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,850
So I kind of know what I'm doing, all right?

555
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,310
Thank you for the ride.

556
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,660
It's a tool of the trade.

557
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,680
The car one says "Toyota."

558
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,840
I have eyes on the grooms.

559
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,970
I'm three feet behind you.

560
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,380
How's it going? Are people showing up?

561
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,760
It's all under control.

562
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,020
Surprise! Guess who's on time.

563
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,630
Oh, my god!

564
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,060
Sal, wow, you're pregnant.

565
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,320
Congratulations!

566
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,690
Thank you. We're really excited.

567
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,310
You're huge.

568
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,590
Nice teeth.

569
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,020
Uh, so, w-where's Tony?

570
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,950
Oh, beats me.

571
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,900
Haven't spoken to him since the divorce.

572
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,820
Yeah, it's, uh, Eddie. Eddie! Baby!

573
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,050
Come here! Come meet the girls!

574
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,810
Eddie.

575
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,920
- This is Eddie. - Eddie.

576
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,970
Cam, Mitch, Peps, this guy.

577
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,460
This is Eddie, my baby daddy.

578
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,830
So, why didn't you tell us?

579
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,510
Oh, you know,

580
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,900
we just wanted to get through that first trimester

581
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,120
before we let the cat out of the bag.

582
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,400
When was that -- last summer?

583
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,540
So, y-you're -- you're how far along now?

584
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,890
About four months. Right, honey?

585
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,000
Just about the exact amount of time eddie and I have been together.

586
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,990
I don't understand.

587
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,410
Four is this many, yes?

588
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,420
Si?

589
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,980
Hola, handsome boys.

590
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,260
You two look gorgeous.

591
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,470
- Gracias. - Oh, thank you.

592
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,350
Pretty nice, huh? Like a regular wedding.

593
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,370
Good start, Jay.

594
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,610
Hey, Merle, it's your son's wedding --

595
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,410
Maybe lose the toothpick?

596
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm getting tired of this nagging.

597
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,820
- I'm leaving you. - What?

598
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,930
Not if I leave you first!

599
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,370
No, no, no, you don't mean this!

600
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,750
Oh, don't you feel bad, honey.

601
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,390
You have helped me today.

602
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,940
Thanks for getting me over the hump.

603
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,930
What did you do?

604
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,710
Wow. We're doing this

605
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,390
Are you ready?

606
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,310
I don't want to wait another minute.

607
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,490
Lily, hit it.

608
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,400
On 3, boys.

609
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,210
1, 2 --

610
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,510
Attention! Attention, please!

611
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,230
The fire has jumped the freeway.

612
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,090
I'm really sorry, folks.

613
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,640
I'm gonna have to evacuate everyone immediately.

614
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,860
So, this our bump.
