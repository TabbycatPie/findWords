00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,365
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,648
JEFF MALONE: What I want is to work
at Pearson Specter

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,647
and to keep seeing you.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,171
Those two things are not
both going to happen.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,327
You've been here for three months.

6
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,841
All you've done is hit singles
and I need a goddamn home run.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,882
- Jonathan, listen...
- I don't want to hear it.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,411
Start making us some real money.

9
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,090
A man like Walter Gillie

10
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,730
isn't gonna listen to a guy like you,

11
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,525
offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

12
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,768
Walter, I can't guarantee you we'll win,

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,327
but I can guarantee you
that I will never sell you out.

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,726
All right, I'm in.

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,245
You're talking hostile takeover.

16
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,727
- Gillie Industries...
- Logan, we have a conflict.

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,041
You're either with me or against me.

18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,561
And that includes all
$1 billion of my business.

19
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,803
Get moving on drawing up
a tender offer for Logan Sanders.

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,604
Do you remember when I told you

21
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,882
that I once had an affair
with a married man?

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,766
It was him.

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,851
You're up early.

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,401
So are you.

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,761
Well, I have to be.
You don't.

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,609
I was already awake.

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,326
- Thinking.
- About last night? Look, Mike, I...

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,522
It's okay. I'm good.

29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,121
You're good with me working
on the takeover with Logan?

30
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,685
Why do you not
seem to believe me?

31
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,131
Because you weren't
good last night.

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,562
Which was before this morning
when I realized that that's work.

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,760
This isn't.

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,004
So, as long as we don't let
that affect this...

35
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,201
We won't.

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,811
In that case, let's set
some in-home ground rules.

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,520
Obviously, the first...

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,483
Uh, respecting
each other's privacy.

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,567
Exactly.

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,729
The left-hand side of the desk belongs
to the United Nation of Ross.

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,080
- You're not a nation.
- I have a flag.

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,811
Fine, as long as we agree
that any perusal of my phone

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,810
- is considered a breach of my borders.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,571
I thought you liked it
when I breached your borders.

45
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,681
Mmm, well, those are
different kind of borders.

46
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,566
- In that case, a breach is allowed.
- Allowed?

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,409
Encouraged.

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,924
- Requested.
- (WHISPERING) Demanded.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,764
- Let's go make you late for work.
- Mmm.

50
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,644
LOUIS: Jessica, lam telling you.

51
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,649
The SEC is gonna send
Jeff Malone after us,

52
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,525
and nobody is better suited
to beat him down than...

53
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,041
You guessed it,
because we all know

54
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,930
that this is better than this,
which will result in this,

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,527
which will also result in this,

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,211
and this,

57
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,804
and this.

58
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,724
And what do I want in return?

59
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,484
Oh, you know what I want.

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,491
You've always known.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,206
And after I win,

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,848
you'll not only be willing
to give it to me,

63
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,724
you're gonna be begging
to give it to me.

64
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,846
Ha!

65
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,601
- Louis.
- B... Not now.

66
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,643
- Louis, I have to talk to you.
- Not now.

67
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,125
How many times have I told you?

68
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,924
Unless you have photoshopped
my head onto a dragon,

69
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,764
do not interrupt me
while I'm perfecting my pitch.

70
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,451
Your pitch doesn't need
to be perfect. It needs to be now.

71
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,806
- Why?
- Malone is here.

72
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,770
- He's here?
- In the lobby.

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,924
- And Jessica just asked to see you.
- Okay, out of my way.

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,123
Aren't... Aren't you going
to bring your easel?

75
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,841
Oh, I don't need an easel
to kick this suckefs ass.

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,241
Jessica.

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,722
Jessica, I got your message,
and I just wanted to...

78
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,242
Louis, this is Jeff Malone.

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,530
Yeah, I know who he is.
He's with the SEC.

80
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,802
He was until this morning.

81
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,764
We brought him over
because we have reason

82
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,405
to believe they'll
be coming after us.

83
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,362
Wait, what?

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,642
Jeff is our newest senior partner.

85
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,243
He's going to be taking on the SEC.

86
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,766
Because you suck.

87
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,326
And I wanted to introduce him
to you first

88
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,609
because you're a loser.

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,682
Who can get him up to speed
on Felton Securities.

90
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,367
Because you're never
going to be a name partner.

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,289
And you're both experts in finance.

92
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,924
Louis, I'm really looking
forward to working with you

93
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,524
- on Felton Securities.
- Yeah, me too.

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,365
You suck.
You're a loser.

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,081
Louis?

96
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,044
Is there something else?

97
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,364
No. Nothing.

98
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,085
How long have you been
working on that?

99
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,042
Two hours.

100
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,321
You know it's called a brief, right?

101
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,205
- You know his name's Harvey, right?
- You make a compelling argument.

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,246
So, I got your note.

103
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,450
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Um...

104
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,007
Logan Sanders.

105
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,201
What about him?

106
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,847
We sort of dated a few years ago.

107
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,202
Wait, hang on. Define "sort of."

108
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,845
- Definitely.
- Define "dated."

109
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,881
- We had an affair while he was married.
- Holy shit.

110
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,725
- I know. And I...
- Yes, you have to tell Harvey.

111
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,089
Because, Rachel, if there's
two things that Harvey hates,

112
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,568
it's things being kept from him
and things being kept from him.

113
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,522
I know.

114
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,968
- Then what am I doing here?
- I don't know how to tell him.

115
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,686
Quickly, because Logan's
gonna be here in an hour.

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,804
And, Rach, it's less important
how you tell Harvey

117
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,969
than that you tell Harvey. Go.

118
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,561
Okay-

119
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
These are nice.

120
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,569
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

121
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,923
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

122
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,249
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

123
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,682
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

124
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,451
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,042
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

126
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,081
All right!

127
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,603
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

128
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,490
The greenback boogie

129
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,410
I was wondering all day
if you would be here.

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,521
I can't do this.

131
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,802
- What? Rachel...
- It's wrong.

132
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,327
Wrong?
You're the one who kissed me.

133
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,249
And I was wrong.

134
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,361
No, you weren't.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,128
My whole life I've done everything
that I was supposed to do,

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,165
and all it did was make me miserable.
Ever since I met you...

137
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,008
I can't stop thinking about you,
and all I want to do...

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,930
Logan... Logan, if we do this,

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,883
someone's gonna find out at some point
and then what?

140
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,086
I don't care.

141
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,731
Okay-

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,604
Harvey, I need to tell you...

143
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,281
Rachel?

144
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,521
Logan.

145
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,089
- Where's Harvey?
- I don't know. I'm early.

146
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,970
- He doesn't like it when people...
- What are you doing here?

147
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,645
I'm Harvey's associate.

148
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,730
You did it, you went to law school.

149
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,248
- Not exactly. I'm in law school.
- Rachel, that's great.

150
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,291
- I'm really proud of you.
- I'm just gonna come back.

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,243
You came in here to tell him about us,
didn't you?

152
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,645
How'd you know?

153
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,321
It's all over your face.

154
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,647
- Logan...
- Please don't tell him.

155
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,807
I have to tell him.

156
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,761
Rachel...

157
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,285
Do you know what people think

158
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,402
when a son takes over
his father's company?

159
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,926
That his father's proud of him?

160
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,326
That he didn't earn it.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,526
Which is why I'm not looking
to advertise the fact

162
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,607
that I once had an affair.

163
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,724
You're not advertising it.
You're disclosing it to counsel.

164
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,161
Okay, look, you want the truth?

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,726
I'm not proud of the way
I was back then.

166
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,248
The way I treated Allison,
the way I treated you.

167
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,211
But I'm not that person anymore,

168
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,288
and I don't want people
to think that I am.

169
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,528
And I understand that,
but I work for Harvey,

170
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,286
and I can't keep things from him
that he needs to know.

171
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,731
- He doesn't need to know this.
- Yes, he does.

172
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,682
Why is that?

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,162
Because I happen to live
with the man on the other side

174
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,441
of the takeover battle.

175
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,641
Oh, no. You need some
"me time" already?

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,163
It's not "me time."
It's "I'm gonna kick your ass time."

177
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,404
I think we both know you only
kick ass after eating a hot dog.

178
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,921
I could be drinking a juice box
and still kick your ass.

179
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,004
I don't think so, because I have this.

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,681
Just read it to me.

181
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,801
"Harvey Specter,
you are summoned to appear..."

182
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,207
You gotta be kidding me.
You're subpoenaing me?

183
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,641
- Oh, yeah.
- I filed a TRO.

184
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,047
- I'm gonna block your tender offer.
- Bullshit, you are.

185
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,685
Well, we'll see what the judge has to say.

186
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,211
Oh, right.
You got your hands full.

187
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,049
Here, let me get that
for you. There you go.

188
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,369
Hearing's at 2:00. I'll see you then.
Oh, Harvey, the suit...

189
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,687
It's a little dated for court,
don't you think?

190
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,328
Did you get everything
settled with HR?

191
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,561
Yeah.

192
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,530
Comer office.
You really must like me.

193
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,687
(CHUCKLES)

194
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,604
Don't get too excited.

195
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,449
You know, the last two partners
that had this office

196
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,561
didn't survive the year.

197
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,284
Then it's a good thing
I'm much better than they were.

198
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,601
You don't even know
who they were.

199
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,529
That doesn't matter, Jessica.
I know who I am.

200
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,726
Me too. Cocky lawyer in a comer office
who hasn't done a thing for me yet.

201
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,691
Yet.

202
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,648
By the way, I understand it's
tradition for the name partner

203
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,205
to welcome a new partner with lunch.

204
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,520
Jeff, when I told you
that our relationship

205
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,927
is now purely professional,
I was serious.

206
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,611
Jessica, what's not purely professional
about lunch?

207
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,161
Unless you mean the sex
that will be following lunch?

208
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,006
Oh, you're not hearing me.

209
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,849
Oh, I'm hearing you.
I'm just ignoring you.

210
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,009
But I promise I won't be
ignoring you at lunch.

211
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,721
<i>Cock!!-</i>

212
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,609
Harvey. Harvey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

213
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,607
Yeah, sure, come on in.

214
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,364
I was actually hoping
that we could talk in my office.

215
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,970
- What's the...
- You're early.

216
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,731
Did you...
Oh, you two haven't met.

217
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,410
Rachel, Logan. Logan, Rachel.

218
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,721
- I guess you didn't.
- Didn't what?

219
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,526
We actually have met before.
That's why I was trying to find you.

220
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,404
- To tell me you met our client?
- No.

221
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,524
To tell you that we used
to be in a relationship together.

222
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,766
You looking to get back together?

223
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,007
- No.
- No.

224
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,884
- Then I don't give a shit.
- Good.

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,684
Then we can move on to why
you didn't tell me that the guy

226
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,962
on the other side of this fight
used to be your associate.

227
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,770
- I was going to.
- When?

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,689
In 20 minutes, when you were
scheduled to be here.

229
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,131
Unfortunately, I have to reschedule.

230
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,685
- Why?
- I have court.

231
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,450
Mike's alleging I broke privilege.

232
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,369
- Did you?
- Yes, technically,

233
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,925
when I told you to move
up our timeline.

234
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,929
Now, if you'll excuse me.

235
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,965
Wait a minute.
If you... If you broke privilege,

236
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,241
what are you gonna tell the judge?

237
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,850
I don't know,
but until I think of something,

238
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,849
I'm going to confuse the shit
out of everyone I can.

239
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,327
- That doesn't make any sense.
- It makes total sense.

240
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,050
No, it doesn't, Your Honor.

241
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,531
Hold on. Let me get this straight.

242
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,802
- You work for him?
- Worked. I was his associate.

243
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,570
Not the best associate, Your Honor.

244
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,444
- Is that relevant?
- No, but I'd like it on the record.

245
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,369
Well, it's on there now
whether we want it there or not.

246
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,450
And all I'm saying is, there's no
attorney-attorney privilege.

247
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,561
Finally, a fact.

248
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,682
An irrelevant fact,
because at the time of the conflict,

249
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,848
- I was his client.
- Not the best client either.

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,241
Mr. Specter, shut up.
Now you're his client?

251
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,567
No, I was his client... Okay.

252
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,444
I was an associate
at Pearson Specter,

253
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,164
and then I left
to become an investment banker.

254
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,647
It's very confusing. I'd dismiss
the whole motion, Your Honor.

255
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,484
I said, "Shut up."

256
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,924
Are you an attorney
or an investment banker?

257
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,962
I'm an investment banker.

258
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,320
Then what the hell
are you doing in my chambers?

259
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,771
Acting as my own attorney.

260
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,531
And no matter how much he tries
to confuse the issue, he can't.

261
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,882
I told him I was going
after the same company he was

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,207
and he used that knowledge
to move up his tender offer.

263
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,761
- He waived conflict.
- That doesn't apply to privilege.

264
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,326
Bottom line is, he doesn't
have proof of anything.

265
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,601
I don't, but he does.

266
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,290
Unfortunately, he can't force me
to testify. There's no precedent.

267
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,368
Fortunately, there is.

268
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,928
So go ahead, ask him
if he did what I'm saying.

269
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,608
Mr. Specter, do I need to swear you in?

270
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,208
- Give him the TRO.
- You know, I'll do more than that.

271
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,561
Not only can't your client
make a tender offer for 60 days,

272
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,882
they can't purchase
any more stock until then either.

273
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,004
I'm telling you,
we need to negotiate with him.

274
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,246
You mean pay him off?

275
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,044
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

276
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,323
Every day this drags on,
it's millions out of your pocket.

277
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,920
Well, from where I'm sitting,
all I can see is a lawyer

278
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,771
trying to distract me from the fact
that this whole thing is his fault.

279
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,881
If I didn't break privilege,

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,685
he might have locked this whole thing
up before you knew what hit you.

281
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,004
- Fine. We'll negotiate.
- No, I'll negotiate.

282
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,728
- No, not without me.
- Do I need to draw you a picture?

283
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,441
- You, Mike, Rachel.
- Harvey, I appreciate your concern,

284
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,927
but this is my first deal,
so unless you're gonna pay him off

285
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,361
with your money,
I'm gonna be at that meeting.

286
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,290
What are you doing?

287
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,291
I'm writing in my diary.

288
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,049
Isn't that what your dictaphone is for?

289
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,686
No, my dictaphone
is for my singular triumphs,

290
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,280
like when Harvey told me
I was the man,

291
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,049
and my diary is for
my most agonizing defeats,

292
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,771
such as when Jessica just told me
I'll never make name partner.

293
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,121
Louis, she didn't say that.

294
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,608
Well, she might as well have.
She just gave Malone the comer office.

295
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,491
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

296
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,408
And what's more is I think I agreed
to give him Felton Securities.

297
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,563
- Well, un-agree to it.
- No, I can't.

298
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,883
- I shook his hand. The die is cast.
- God damn it, Louis.

299
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,967
You know how this works.

300
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,969
First it's a case. Then it's a client.

301
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,970
Before you know it,
you're on the 38th floor with Ted.

302
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,684
- Who's Ted?
- Exactly.

303
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,047
Holy shit.

304
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,566
- What did I just do?
- I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

305
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,808
You're gonna stop writing
in that pussy diary,

306
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,644
and you're gonna show
Jessica you're the one

307
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,683
who should be sitting
in that corner office.

308
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,801
All right.

309
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,688
Ready the dictaphone.
We're gonna need it.

310
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,531
Hey. How are things
going with Logan Sanders?

311
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,927
- You have no idea.
- Do I want to have an idea?

312
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,042
Not unless you wanna hear
about how Mike Ross

313
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,606
- is still causing us trouble.
- Nope.

314
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,291
You don't care about Logan Sanders
at all, do you?

315
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,401
No.

316
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,403
This isn't a coincidental
encounter, is it?

317
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,324
No, it is not.

318
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,608
You are having lunch
with Jeff Malone today.

319
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,200
Come on, Jessica. You banged him. The
least you could do is take him to lunch.

320
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,407
That is not funny.

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,968
Wait a second,
you want me to take him to lunch

322
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,845
- because you banged him.
- Harvey...

323
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,442
I want you to go ahead
and say "banged"

324
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,609
to my face one more time.

325
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,242
I'm not going to but not
because I'm scared of you.

326
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,840
Whatever lets you sleep at night,
white boy.

327
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,406
Donna, tell Paul Porter
he's meeting me for lunch.

328
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,205
When he gets there,
tell them to seat him with Jeff Malone.

329
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,731
Who's he not having lunch with?

330
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,569
- Jessica.
- Oh, done.

331
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,648
Aren't you gonna ask me why?

332
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,967
She asked you to go
because she didn't want to.

333
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,445
You're sending Porter
because you don't want to,

334
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,562
but you didn't have
the balls to say no to her face.

335
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,287
Is that it?

336
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,644
- The balls are debatable.
- Balls are never debatable.

337
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,089
- Ah, hey there.
- Hey.

338
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,369
Louis, listen, I just, um...
I just wanted to say one more time

339
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,528
how much I'm really looking
forward to working with you.

340
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,529
Aw, well, I would just like
to say for the first time

341
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,689
that you will not be working with me,
because I will not be giving you my jock,

342
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,161
- let alone my case.
- Yeah.

343
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,450
Okay, I get it.

344
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,730
- So, you're the guy?
- Yeah, I am the guy.

345
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,366
No, not that guy, Louis.
Definitely not that guy.

346
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,648
You're the guy in every office
who wants to piss

347
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,411
on the new guy, you know,
to mark your territory.

348
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,841
So why don't I just walk you on
down to my office?

349
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,849
I'm gonna let you get your
little piss on in my corner,

350
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,486
- and then we can move on.
- Oh, I've moved on.

351
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,364
I've set the deposition
for Todd Smith tomorrow.

352
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,322
You don't think I know about that?

353
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,930
I don't give a shit
whether you know it or not.

354
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,447
It's my job to determine
whether Todd Smith is guilty.

355
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,688
And who do you actually think
is better at determining

356
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,451
whether a guy is guilty
of insider trading, Louis?

357
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,042
A career prosecutor for the SEC,
or a monkey in some Italian suit?

358
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,525
- (CHUCKLES) A monkey?
- Monkey.

359
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,483
Well, you're nothing
but a crowing cock.

360
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,728
And the last cock that
walked into my office

361
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,444
learned what all
the other cocks learned,

362
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,688
that I eat cock for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

363
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,928
Louis, you're gonna let me
in that deposition tomorrow

364
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,922
whether you like it or not.

365
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,201
Why, because you're
gonna run to Jessica?

366
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,687
No, simply because I'm gonna tell
everyone here in the office

367
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,690
that you said you eat cock
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

368
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,485
Yeah, that's right.
It's goddamn delicious.

369
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,045


370
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,641
(BARKS)

371
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,650
So what, you think you can handle
Todd Smith better than me?

372
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,604
Well, let's just see.
Let's just see what you got.

373
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,289
Saw you scheduled a meeting with Mike.

374
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,482
I assume that means
you're going to offer him a deal.

375
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,967
It could mean I'm going to offer him
a trip to Disneyland.

376
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,922
But it doesn't.

377
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,804
Of course not, he'd probably
want to wear mouse ears,

378
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,810
and then nobody wins.
You're welcome.

379
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,604
I didn't thank you.

380
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,722
Since you scheduled the meeting
when I'm at law school,

381
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,410
which you did to cut me out.

382
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,603
Did you get your name
on the wall since lunch?

383
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,964
- No.
- Then let's get something straight.

384
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,730
I didn't set that meeting.
Donna did.

385
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,083
And if I didn't want you there,
I'd just tell you to your face.

386
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
So, let me tell you now.
You're not going to that meeting.

387
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,729
Because you think I can't handle it?

388
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,161
Because I'm not throwing
gasoline on a pile of matches

389
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,725
just to see what happens.

390
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,811
Now, if you're done wasting my time,
you just gave me an idea.

391
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,041
You're welcome.

392
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,286
- Harvey, what are you doing here?
- You said it yourself.

393
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,721
I never brought you a gift
when you moved in.

394
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,968
- Still don't see an orchid.
- Flowers die.

395
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,289
I thought I'd bring something better.

396
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,602
Me.

397
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,926
Across the table from you.

398
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,329
- Where's your client?
- He doesn't need to be here.

399
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,331
This fight started with you and me.
So let's you and me settle it right now.

400
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,044
You mean you don't want him
here because you don't think

401
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,804
Logan Sanders and I
can be in the same room.

402
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,844
- I don't think. I know.
- Harvey, I'm a grown man.

403
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,770
I can sit across the table from somebody
who had a history with Rachel.

404
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,609
Maybe, but you both
have a brain and a dick,

405
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,131
and if you get in
that room together,

406
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,288
the brains aren't gonna be
leading that conversation.

407
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,085
Fine, you tell me
that you have the authority

408
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,009
to negotiate a deal, and I'll negotiate.

409
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
But you can't. 'Cause you don't.

410
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,768
And I'm not gonna agree
to something here today

411
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,803
just to have Logan reject it tomorrow.

412
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,809
So, go home, get some sleep,
and then the three of us

413
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,570
will do this again in the morning.

414
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,362
Look, here's the thing Todd,
you're not actually our client.

415
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,720
Felton Securities is.

416
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,808
And it's my job to find out
if you're telling the truth.

417
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,366
- Bullshit. It's my job.
- Louis, I'm handling this.

418
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,891
No, you're not.

419
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,963
If he doesn't stop lying to me,
I'm gonna cut him looser

420
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,003
than Jared's pants
after a Subway diet.

421
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,326
I'm not lying to you.

422
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,566
You took a tip. All right, Todd.

423
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,409
You took a tip,
used it for your client, and...

424
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,649
- Yes, and now you're trying...
- God damn it, Louis!

425
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,247
Listen, if you don't back
the hell off my interrogation,

426
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,126
I'm gonna pick his scrawny ass up
and use him to beat the shit out of you!

427
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,083
Stop it! You think
I don't know what you're doing?

428
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,770
You're trying to rattle me.

429
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,965
- Uh-oh.
- What?

430
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,286
Uh, your vein.

431
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,561
- Here?
- It's bulging.

432
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,330
Just like mine did,
right before my heart attack.

433
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,408
- Louis, he's not gonna...
- What? Have a heart attack?

434
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,409
That was exactly my thought
ten seconds before I was slumped

435
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,681
on the courtroom floor.

436
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,041
- Oh, wow, it's just like Jenkins.
- Jenkins?

437
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,565
No shit, Jenkins too?

438
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,125
No, he was sitting
right next to me, hand to God.

439
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,288
And, Louis, you should have seen
his wife and kids at the funeral.

440
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,449
- Funeral?
- Yeah, you have kids, Todd?

441
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,527
Yeah, I have two kids.

442
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,847
Yeah, well whether
it's a heart attack or prison time,

443
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,530
if you do not stop lying to us,

444
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,642
they're never going to see
their father again.

445
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,961
Do you understand what I just said?

446
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,320
You are never going to play
soccer with them...

447
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,408
Okay. Okay, I am lying to you.

448
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,801
- But please, you gotta help me.
- Well, we want to.

449
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,321
But, T-dog, you gotta be
straight up with your homies

450
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,963
- if you want us to have your back.
- The truth is, I'm gennaphobic.

451
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,048
I have to wash my hands
throughout the day.

452
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,567
And they get dry. I mean really dry.

453
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,808
So, I have to put on a lot of lotion.

454
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,922
And I know this sounds ridiculous,

455
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,327
but my finger must have slipped
on the keyboard, and I...

456
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,566
I hit the wrong stock.

457
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,003
You're saying that you didn't
even mean to buy that stock?

458
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,770
Nope, but then it skyrocketed,

459
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,530
and I wasn't gonna tell everybody
that I only bought it

460
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,927
because I suffer from dry skin.

461
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,928
Please, you can't cut me loose.
I mean, I... I can't go to prison.

462
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,881
Unsanitary.

463
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,971
Not that it's any of my business,
but it was straight before.

464
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,488
- I know.
- Oh, I get it.

465
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,206
Look less together.
Get underestimated.

466
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,009
You gotta wave your hand slower.

467
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,810
- Thanks.
- No problem.

468
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,526
If you want soap, you just click
your heels together three times.

469
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,563
How do you think
I'm planning to get that dryer to work?

470
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,611
You know, you think you wouldn't
have these problems,

471
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,485
- considering what you guys charge.
- Oh, no, I don't work here.

472
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,205
- But you, uh...
- I used to.

473
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,287
You're Mike Ross.

474
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,925
And you're Logan Sanders.

475
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,171
Paper towel?

476
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,726
Don't mind if I do.

477
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,529
- After you.
- Don't mind if I do.

478
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,120
- I see you two have met.
- We have.

479
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,561
And don't underestimate him
because of his tie.

480
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,081
I have always estimated
that tie correctly.

481
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,524
- Now, can we talk about business?
- Depends on what you're proposing.

482
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,801
That you walk away.

483
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,571
That doesn't sound like much of a deal.

484
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,445
Well, he forgot to add the part
where you walk away $20 million richer.

485
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,009
Pure profit. No risk.

486
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,926
Win-win.

487
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,001
Sounds good.

488
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,244
Guess I just have one question.

489
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,929
What exactly are you going to do
with this company?

490
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,725
All due respect, I don't see
how that's any of your concern.

491
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,888
All due respect, you're the one
coming to me with an offer.

492
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,684
So if I say it's my concern, it is.

493
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,690
Mike, you're asking about
a competitor's business plan.

494
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,883
And if he wants to not be competitors,
then he needs to answer my question.

495
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,490
Okay, I'll tell you.

496
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,887
I'm gonna do what anyone
would and sell it for parts.

497
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,442
No deal.

498
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,050
Okay, Mike. You win.

499
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,048
Let's, uh, make it 30 million.

500
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,560
You could make it a billion, Logan,

501
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,330
and the answer is still
gonna be the same,

502
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,285
'cause I made a promise
to Walter Gillie

503
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,687
that I would fight
to keep his company alive.

504
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,968
And I don't think he's gonna
believe that cutting a deal

505
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,050
to sell his workers out
is keeping that promise.

506
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,571
I thought you said he was smart.

507
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,489
I am, which I why I know
what's going on here.

508
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,529
- What exactly is that?
- No one ever tells you no.

509
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,922
You're used to getting what you want.

510
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,443
But that's gonna stop right now.

511
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,723
You're right.
I do always get what I want.

512
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,524
I don't see how this time's
gonna be any different.

513
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,766
I'll tell you
how it's gonna be different.

514
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,769
This time you're talking
about something that I care about.

515
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,530
So, if you think I'm gonna step aside...

516
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,881
Yeah, I don't care
if you step aside or not.

517
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,123
When I see something
I want, I take it,

518
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,480
and then I do whatever
the hell I want with it.

519
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,331
And what I wanna do with this company
is strip it down,

520
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,169
- flip it over...
- Okay, that's enough.

521
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,248
No, no, no, let him talk.
I wanna hear this. Keep going, Sanders.

522
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,249
No, I don't need to
because you know how this ends.

523
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,522
Yeah, I do, with me and Walter Gillie
on one side

524
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,369
and you crying to your daddy
on the other.

525
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,967
- We're done.
- You're right. We are.

526
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,890
Listen, the next time I say
"Don't come to a meeting,"

527
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,967
don't come to a meeting.

528
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,321
- Hey, he came at me just as hard as...
- I don't give a shit what he did.

529
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,364
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Where are you going?

530
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,845
To get you this company.

531
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,485
- What are you talking about?
- Weren't you listening?

532
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,931
He just gave up his weak spot.

533
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,486
- Was that true about Jenkins?
- I don't even know a Jenkins.

534
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,967
But I do know Todd's vein
wasn't bulging.

535
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,969
And, Louis, you were actually
pretty good in there.

536
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,761
- Yeah, I was. And so were you.
- So, we're in agreement.

537
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,802
Yeah, you don't completely suck.

538
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,048
I just meant that we should stick
by Todd Smith.

539
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,887
That story was so ridiculous,
it just might be true.

540
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,321
Great, I'll call Felton
and make the recommendation.

541
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,403
Well, hold up.
You're gonna do what now?

542
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,603
- Call my client?
- Louis.

543
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,688
It may be your client,
but it's still my case.

544
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,929
- Like hell it is, Jeff.
- Okay. Okay, you call.

545
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,202
Oh, I plan to.
And when I do I'll be telling them

546
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,129
that Mr. Slippery Fingers
is no longer our problem.

547
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,608
Just one second ago
you said you believed him.

548
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,007
Yeah, I also told you that
his story was so ridiculous

549
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,201
and nobody would believe it.

550
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,004
Well, then it's our job
to make them believe it, Louis,

551
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,647
- or this guy could wind up in prison.
- He is not my concern, Jeff.

552
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,370
Felton Securities is.

553
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,365
Walter Gillie knows what he's doing.

554
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,727
Yeah, so do I. He's letting
your pension go unfunded,

555
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,604
so he can hoard a billion dollars.

556
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,122
No, that money is earmarked
for expansion into Asia,

557
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,408
and I believe in Walter's vision.

558
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,205
You might, but do
the workers you represent?

559
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,689
- You're acting as if our fund is empty.
- I'm acting as if it's 40% full.

560
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,610
And let me guess,
you're gonna fill up the rest.

561
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,451
Someone else wants
to acquire Gillie' company

562
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,891
before we can make an offer.

563
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,726
If you vote to block it,

564
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,327
we will fully fund your pension
the day we take over.

565
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,008
You're talking about me
selling out my friend.

566
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,691
I'm talking about $500 million.

567
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,529
And why can you fund it and they can't?

568
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,722
Well, they can with half
that billion, but they won't.

569
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,571
Because like I said,
he's hoarding it for that pipe dream.

570
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,001
You're gonna take
that billion for yourselves.

571
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,326
Half.

572
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,568
The other half goes to you
and your union,

573
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,524
the men Walter Gillie
supposedly cares about.

574
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,968
Pete, this is gonna happen
whether it's me or someone else.

575
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,849
And someone else may not
give you the chance to do

576
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,610
what you were elected to do.

577
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,725
Protect your people.

578
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,811
. HEY-
. HEY-

579
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,608
How'd your meeting
with Harvey go today?

580
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,565
I thought talking
about work was against the rules.

581
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,524
Mmm, talking about work is.
Talking about our day isn't.

582
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,608
I mean, if we can't do that,
then we're letting the case

583
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,643
come between us, right?

584
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,366
My meeting with Harvey went fine.

585
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,041
But you didn't take the deal.

586
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,409
Because it wasn't a good deal.

587
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,561
Fine.

588
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,202
Okay, what's the matter with you?

589
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,244
What's the matter is that
I heard what happened.

590
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,684
- From him?
- No, from Donna.

591
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,922
But it could have been
from any of the 50 people

592
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,246
who saw the two of you
going at it.

593
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,521
- Rachel...
- Just tell me this.

594
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,251
Did you refuse the deal
because it wasn't good enough

595
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,486
or because it came from Logan?

596
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,801
You think I didn't take this deal

597
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,604
because of your history
with this asshole?

598
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,131
Well, you did
just call him an asshole.

599
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,129
He's an asshole because
he's willing to decimate a company

600
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,004
just to put some money
in his pocket.

601
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,642
Look, I gave my word
to Walter Gillie.

602
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,728
That's what I told Harvey
and what I told Logan

603
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,490
and what I didn't think
I'd have to tell you.

604
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,367
I'm just saying, all of this
could have been over today.

605
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,290
You think I don't
want this to be over? I do.

606
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,640
But I can't take that deal.

607
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,967
And we said we wouldn't let this
come between us.

608
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,491
So don't.

609
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,245
- Hi, Donna.
- DONNA: Hey, Louis.

610
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,361
What can I do for you?

611
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,123
Oh, well, I just came in
to bring you this and this

612
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,963
and all of these.

613
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,447
Those are the last seven
Todd Smiths you evaluated.

614
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,447
- Donna...
- Seven.

615
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,891
And you didn't cut
one of them loose.

616
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,048
- You heard me and Malone.
- I did.

617
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,844
And you're cutting
this guy loose just to spite him.

618
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,882
That's ridiculous.

619
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,287
Okay, so this has nothing
to do with Malone?

620
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,401
Nothing.

621
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,411
- Where'd you get that?
- Come on. You know where I got it.

622
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,726
Louis...

623
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,090
I know he took your dream.

624
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,967
I mean, she didn't even consider me.

625
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,482
Just brings him in, have me train him,
and gives him the comer office.

626
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,089
Hey, did I ever tell you
about the time that I auditioned

627
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,929
for Hamlet in college?

628
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,643
- Obviously, you played Ophelia.
- No, Christy Kiff did.

629
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,569
I was her understudy,

630
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,682
and I was so jealous.

631
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,406
I found myself wishing that
something would happen to her,

632
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,525
that she would get sick
or she would twist an ankle.

633
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,530
And then, the day before we closed...

634
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,571
Her father died.

635
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
- Donna, that wasn't your fault.
- But I still felt horrible

636
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,725
and ashamed

637
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,731
'cause my jealousy had brought out
something really ugly in me.

638
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,688
And as you can tell,
I still regret that.

639
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,401
You know you've never told me a story
about yourself like that before.

640
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,360
I've never told anyone
that story before.

641
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,769
Louis, I know how badly
you wanted this.

642
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,363
But this is a man's life.

643
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,086
We won't cut him loose.
I'll tell Malone.

644
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,484
I'm proud of you, Louis.

645
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,125
JONATHAN: Did you get an offer
to walk away from your takeover?

646
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,891
- I did.
- What was the offer?

647
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,288
- Thirty million.
- And you turned it down?

648
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,606
What the hell is wrong with you?

649
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,926
They're gonna rip the company apart.

650
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,805
I don't care if they wanna use
Walter Gillie' head as a paperweight.

651
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,491
You said you wanted a grand slam.
That offer is a double.

652
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,931
Well, I'd rather have
a double than nothing.

653
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,121
Look, I know
what I am doing here.

654
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,281
Do you?

655
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,845
Because they just
flipped the head of the union.

656
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,803
And without his vote,
we don't have shit.

657
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,684
- What?
- These guys play to win.

658
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,804
They just promised a half billion dollar
donation to their pension fund.

659
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,366
And unless Walter Gillie is
gonna match it, we're done.

660
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,766
Yeah.

661
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,160
That's what I thought.

662
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,081
You get that $30 million,
or you find yourself another job.

663
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,283
(KNOCKING)
Donna.

664
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,527
- Did you need something?
- No, but Louis does.

665
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,848
He was planning to pitch you
that he take on Jeff Malone

666
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,803
before you and Harvey
even met him.

667
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,365
He saw Woodall coming
before we did?

668
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,007
And if he won, he was hoping that
that would mean name partner.

669
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,208
I empathize with that, Donna. I do.
But I have to make decisions

670
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,324
- based on what's best for the firm.
- And I'm not here to change your mind,

671
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,363
but maybe if you did
something else for Louis.

672
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,402
Such as?

673
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,251
Giving him the comer office.

674
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,410
- You mean Jeff Malone's office?
- He could move to Louis'.

675
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,365
I appreciate you letting me
know about Louis,

676
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,925
but I'm not going to do that.

677
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,201
Well, why not?
Jeff Malone just got here.

678
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,129
Because I said so.
Now if you'll excuse me...

679
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,049
You're sleeping with him.

680
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,446
- What?
- Of course.

681
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,251
That glow, the morning meetings,
you had Harvey take your lunch.

682
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,522
How could I miss it?
I'm losing my edge.

683
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,326
Donna, there is nothing
going on between...

684
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,805
You're not losing your edge.

685
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,763
But I ended my relationship
with Jeff Malone the day that I hired him.

686
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,530
And I respect that.

687
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,611
But you said you make decisions
based on what's best for the firm.

688
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,530
Isn't giving Louis his dignity back
good for the firm?

689
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,886
Hey, I got your message.

690
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,843
Usually when someone
wants to talk business...

691
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,200
I want to take your offer.

692
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,921
Mike, that offer's gone.

693
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,323
And what if I told you I'd take less?

694
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,000
I'd say I can't give you less.

695
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,610
Come on,
you're the guy who settles.

696
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,451
I'm telling you I wanna settle.

697
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,642
You're telling me you have to settle.

698
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,364
And I know that
you can get that offer back.

699
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,925
It's not my job to get it back.

700
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,849
And even if it was, you think
he's gonna give you a nickel

701
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,689
- after what you said to him?
- What I said to him?

702
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,041
- What about what he said to me?
- I don't care what he said to you.

703
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,851
I gave you a way out, and you insisted
on going to that meeting.

704
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,928
You didn't do that for me.
You did that for your client.

705
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,686
What difference does it make?
It was a win-goddamn-win.

706
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,690
- And you shit all over it.
- Now I'm saying, I'll take it.

707
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,610
Yeah, well, it doesn't work that way.
I'm here as a courtesy.

708
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,848
You're only here because you lost.

709
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,883
- Harvey, I'm...
- Enough.

710
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,091
That company's fate is sealed.
It always has been.

711
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,124
And the next time
you walk away from the table,

712
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,641
be prepared to walk away
from the table.

713
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,886
(SIGHS)

714
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,926
Wanna pour me one of those?

715
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,366
Help yourself.

716
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,724
So what's going on with Mike Ross?

717
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,530
How do you know I'm thinking
about Mike Ross?

718
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,846
Who else would it be?

719
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,405
He got you on the ropes?

720
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,446
No, I got him.

721
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,847
- And he's about to go down.
- How do you know?

722
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,291
'Cause the only way
to stay in the game

723
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,051
is to get Walter Gillie
to give up his dream.

724
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,171
And you don't think he has the stomach
to rip off the arm to save the body.

725
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,281
No, he doesn't.

726
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,204
You don't seem to feel
good about that.

727
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,766
No, I don't.

728
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,841
Harvey.

729
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,603
Do you remember
when I gave you the Collins case?

730
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,727
Yeah.

731
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,723
It was brutal, what we had to do.

732
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,603
It was my first taste of that kind of thing.

733
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,290
And you loved it.

734
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,521
What's your point?

735
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,931
Some people love the taste of blood.
Other people, hmm.

736
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,884
Better to find out who you are
sooner than later.

737
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,889
You saying I'm doing him a favor?

738
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,404
I'm saying, you're being who you are
and letting him be who he is.

739
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,486
What are you doing?

740
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,602
I'm just thinking about how much
I'm going to miss having my own office.

741
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,291
Put your pride away, okay?
You can still go back to Harvey.

742
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,640
I went back to Harvey.

743
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,090
The money's off the table.

744
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,603
Then you have to flip that vote.

745
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,445
The only way to do that
is to get Walter Gillie

746
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,121
to put $500 million
into that pension fund.

747
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,607
And if he does that,
he loses his expansion.

748
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,687
Mike, then do it.

749
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,327
Amy, when his son died,
this company became his family.

750
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,448
If he doesn't expand, then
his company's gonna die too.

751
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,881
I ask him to do that,
then I'm no better than Logan.

752
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,889
No, you are better,
because after you do this,

753
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,525
you're still gonna fight
to keep them alive.

754
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,244
Gillie is not gonna
see it that way.

755
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,089
He's just gonna see
some slick banker

756
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,208
who sold him a bill of goods
just to end up doing

757
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,482
what everybody else
was at least up front about.

758
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,886
Hmm.

759
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,083
Then why don't you
just pack up your shit

760
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,009
and crawl out of here with
your tail between your legs?

761
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,771
Because if you don't have
the stomach to handle this,

762
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,320
then you don't belong here.

763
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,642
Hey, uh, got your message.

764
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,603
Is there something wrong
with Felton Securities?

765
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,165
- Not at all.
- Oh, thank God.

766
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,329
I just assumed since you wanted
to meet here in Malone's office.

767
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,805
- Oh, this isn't his office anymore.
- Oh, did he get fired?

768
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,088
No, but he is moving.

769
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,523
Louis, I know it hasn't always been easy
for you to embrace new partners,

770
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,564
but you've made
a great effort with Jeff.

771
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,087
All in a day's work.

772
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,522
And your day's work has benefited
this firm for years.

773
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,006
So we thought it was time to show you
a little overdue appreciation.

774
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,247
This office?

775
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,805
I gave this office to Jeff because
I wanted him to feel valued here.

776
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,325
But the truth is,
I... I should have given it to you.

(SNIFFLES)

778
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,211
I don't know what to say.

779
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,083
Okay. All right, let it out.
(SOBS)

780
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,371
No way. Pete Kreeling
would never side with them.

781
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,245
He would, and he has,
because they offered what you couldn't,

782
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,886
- security for his workers.
- They're my goddamn workers.

783
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,889
Then show them
that you care about them.

784
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,043
Fund the pension, and fund it now.

785
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,650
You told me you'd fight
to keep this from happening.

786
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,967
I told you I would fight
to protect your company.

787
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,684
And right now, this is
the best way of doing that.

788
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,280
You're talking about
using my expansion money.

789
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,165
If you don't use it now,
there's gonna be nothing to expand.

790
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,123
You son of a bitch,
you manipulated me.

791
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,289
No, I told you a war was coming
and that you needed a war chest.

792
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,765
Well, now is the time to crack it open.

793
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,202
You told me what I wanted to hear
to get me on your side.

794
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,731
- You're the same as them.
- You're wrong.

795
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,922
I looked you in the eye,
and I told you that I wanted

796
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,128
to save your company.
They looked me in the eye

797
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,730
and told me they wanted
to rip it apart.

798
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,080
You're the same as them!

799
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,009
And you're an naive old man
having a tantrum

800
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,770
because he's not getting his way!

801
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,608
That expansion was my dream.

802
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,121
I know.

803
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,483
But now it's time to wake up.

804
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,243
Fund the pension, Walter.

805
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,450
Pete Kreeling's vote
stays in our favor, and...

806
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,248
We live to fight another day.

807
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,762
No.

808
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,406
I just wanted to thank you,
you know, for the new office.

809
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,561
It's a downgrade.

810
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,966
Not to me.

811
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,048
I also wanted to thank
you for lunch.

812
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,924
- I didn't show up for lunch.
- I know.

813
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,610
You thought you were
sending me a message.

814
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,929
- I was sending you a message.
- Not the one you wanted, Jessica.

815
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,442
You see, because what I heard is that
you don't trust yourself around me.

816
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,324
If I didn't,

817
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,924
I wouldn't have put you right next door.

818
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,690
Jessica, say what you will,

819
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,689
but we both know
where this is headed,

820
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,920
you and me watching these.

821
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,166
- You think you know me that well?
- Well, if I don't,

822
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,611
I'm about to.

823
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,451
Neighbor.

824
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,804
More. More. More. Ah.

825
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,451
Thank you.

826
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,320
Happy comer office.

827
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,171
Open it.

828
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,089
- Is this...
- Me.

829
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,961
As Ophelia.

830
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,246
- But I thought you...
- Yeah, well...

831
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,642
Sometimes bitter memories...

832
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,808
Become bittersweet...

833
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,209
When you share them with a friend.

834
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,845
You here to pick up Rachel?

835
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,688
No. No, I just came by to say thanks.

836
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,807
For what?

837
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,966
For not giving me a way out.

838
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,291
- You funded the pension.
- Hundred percent.

839
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,728
You just got rid of half your war chest.

840
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,811
Maybe, but I also
did what you thought I couldn't do.

841
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,371
I got the vote back.

842
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,324
Maybe now you'll realize
that I'm willing to go the distance.

843
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,730
- All you did was make it to round two.
- Oh, so you thought

844
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,247
this was gonna be like
one of those early Tyson fights,

845
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,442
the ones that only lasted 45 seconds.

846
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,850
Remember what happened the first time
someone made it out of round one?

847
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,041
And whatever did happen
to Buster Douglas?

848
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,485
I don't know, but wherever he is,
they can't take that title away from him.

849
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,841
Hey.

850
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,926
Hey.

851
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,929
- What you working on?
- You know what I'm working on.

852
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,160
You wanna go home?

853
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,691
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

854
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,605
Harvey.

855
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,531
Guess that means you're
gonna be working late, huh?

856
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,564
Um...

857
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,883
Thanks to the guy we're up against.

858
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,005
He is proving to be much tougher
than everyone expected.

859
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,811
- Everyone?
- Not everyone.

860
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,489
He sounds like a real douchebag.

861
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,044
You know, he's not that tough.

862
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,043
I can work on this tomorrow.
Let's get out of here.

863
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,362
You really gonna
work on that tomorrow?

864
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,927
No, I'm going to work on it later tonight,
but at least I'll be home.

865
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,042
MIKE: Oh. Think I can
take a look at it when you're done?

866
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,606
- RACHEL: I think not.
- MIKE: Just a proofread?

867
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,926
RACHEL: Ah, still no.
