1
00:00:00,843 --> 00:00:02,076
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:04,845
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,853
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,890
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:15,493
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:17,395
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:20,765
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:24,135
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:26,237
I am The Flash!

10
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:29,174
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:31,475
I get a vision of something
that's already happened,

12
00:00:31,477 --> 00:00:32,944
and then it's gone.

13
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,445
I don't want anyone
to know about this.

14
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:35,980
When you created the Singularity

15
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:38,717
above Central City, you
also created a breach

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,352
between my world and yours,
connecting our two earths.

17
00:00:41,354 --> 00:00:44,089
52 breaches in Central
City and the biggest one

18
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,890
just happens to be
in our basement.

19
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:47,792
The person who broke into
my facility last night

20
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:50,394
was Harrison Wells.

21
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:52,731
Hey, put him down!

22
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:57,235
Who the hell are you?

23
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:01,634
Hello.

24
00:01:01,635 --> 00:01:02,858
EARTH TWO

25
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,375
For those of you
who don't know me,

26
00:01:04,377 --> 00:01:06,444
my name is Harrison Wells.

27
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:07,289
We know you.

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,788
8 MONTHS AGO

29
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:12,183
Today, the future has arrived.

30
00:01:12,185 --> 00:01:15,186
Our city has seen incredible...

31
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:18,923
impossible things: meta-humans...
men and women...

32
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,725
with extraordinary abilities:

33
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:23,027
the ability to soar
above buildings,

34
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:26,931
to run faster than
the speed of light.

35
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,367
Unfortunately, most
of these meta-humans

36
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,804
have chosen the wrong path with
these powers, a dark path.

37
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:35,874
My team and I at S.T.A.R.
Labs are committed

38
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:38,709
to keeping up with
these perilous times,

39
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:40,945
and so may I present
to you our new line

40
00:01:40,947 --> 00:01:42,781
of meta-human awareness apps?

41
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:48,210
NEXT GEN TABLET
S.T.A.R. LABORATORIES

42
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:54,392
This technology will allow
you to instantly detect

43
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:56,094
the presence of a meta-human.

44
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:58,263
You'll be instantly alerted
to an approaching speedster,

45
00:01:58,265 --> 00:01:59,563
like Zoom or like...

46
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:07,605
Flash.

47
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:14,245
Welcome, Flash.

48
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:16,080
Tell them the truth, Dr. Wells.

49
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:18,382
Everything that has happened to
this city the past two years

50
00:02:18,384 --> 00:02:19,784
is because of you.

51
00:02:19,786 --> 00:02:21,419
You created all of us metas.

52
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,788
You created Zoom.

53
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,256
I created Zoom?

54
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:27,091
11 hours before the
first meta sighting,

55
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:29,227
enormous blasts of
dark matter radiation

56
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,229
were silently expelled
beneath this lab.

57
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,664
I'm sorry, Flash, I believe
all this fast running

58
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:35,099
may have scrambled your brain.

59
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,568
You take no responsibility
for the wreckage

60
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,137
your mistakes have caused.

61
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,973
Admit it, Wells, and
then maybe you can truly

62
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:44,175
help me do something about it.

63
00:02:44,177 --> 00:02:47,262
Help you, because I'm the greatest
tech entrepreneur of all time?

64
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:49,147
You're the superhero,

65
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:51,082
and we would all be safe

66
00:02:51,084 --> 00:02:54,819
if you would just do
your job and stop Zoom.

67
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:05,529
Well, I guess it's safe to say
the speedster sensors work.

68
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:10,034
- You okay, Dad?
- I'm fine, sweetie.

69
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,903
Now where was I?

70
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:15,706
Oh, that's right, the future.

71
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:27,752
Very strange to be holding
your autobiography,

72
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,687
especially when you
didn't write it

73
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,322
and it's not about you.

74
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:36,794
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,
meet Dr. Harrison Wells

75
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,496
from Earth-2.

76
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:41,699
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,702
So let me get this straight.

78
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:48,506
You're the doppelganger of
the man who murdered his mom

79
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,909
and is responsible
for both Ronnie

80
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:52,410
and Eddie's deaths?

81
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:53,577
Yeah, but he's not
even the doppelganger

82
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,346
of the Dr. Wells that we knew

83
00:03:55,348 --> 00:03:56,881
because that Dr. Wells'
body had been taken over

84
00:03:56,883 --> 00:03:59,284
by the Reverse Flash, who
was really Eobard Thawne

85
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:03,988
and Eddie's distant
relative from the future.

86
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,990
Yeah, I didn't follow any of that.
I'm my own man.

87
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:07,258
I had nothing to
do with the murder

88
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,592
of your mother or
your friend Ricky.

89
00:04:08,594 --> 00:04:10,461
- His name was Ronnie.
- Him either.

90
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:13,031
You told me you have
proof of your identity?

91
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:16,334
This almost hit me when I
went through the portal.

92
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:18,269
Your stabilized breach
downstairs connects directly

93
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,305
to the S.T.A.R.
Labs on my Earth.

94
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:21,672
Technically, this could be mine,

95
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:23,808
but I want to run
some tests on you.

96
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,243
I'll be genetically
indistinguishable

97
00:04:25,245 --> 00:04:26,377
from my Earth-1 counterpart.

98
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,812
Your tests will reveal nothing.

99
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:29,047
Great! Still gonna run 'em.

100
00:04:29,049 --> 00:04:30,315
Be my guest.

101
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:32,016
Why are we even
listening to him?

102
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:33,784
How do we know he's not
evil like the other guy?

103
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:35,320
He saved my life last night.

104
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,088
The question is why.

105
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,789
I'm guessing you didn't
travel between dimensions

106
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,024
just to meet The Flash.

107
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,692
That's exactly what I did.

108
00:04:41,694 --> 00:04:44,762
I came here to help you, Barry,
to stop your greatest enemy.

109
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,130
He already did that.

110
00:04:46,132 --> 00:04:47,765
I'm not talking about
Reverse Flash.

111
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,268
I'm talking about Zoom.

112
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,669
I see you've already
heard of him.

113
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,172
Yeah, Zoom has been
sending meta-humans

114
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:56,707
from your world through
the breaches to fight me.

115
00:04:56,709 --> 00:04:59,210
Well, they're the symptoms.

116
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:01,045
Zoom's the plague,

117
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,614
one that's infected my world,
and now he's coming for yours.

118
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:04,748
What do you know about Zoom?

119
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,985
Everything.

120
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:10,288
I created Zoom.

121
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,857
I'm responsible for all
the Earth-2 meta-humans,

122
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:14,292
a fact I've ignored
for far too long,

123
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:18,296
but now I'm doing
something about it.

124
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,531
Yeah, well, we're
batting a thousand

125
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,467
against these breachers.

126
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,668
You're batting a
thousand, Cisco?

127
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,337
What's your sample size?

128
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:29,073
Ten? Less?

129
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:32,276
Zoom is obsessed with speed.

130
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,612
He will never allow there
to be another speedster

131
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:36,214
in the multiverse, and
he's gonna keep sending

132
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:38,916
these metas here,
one after the next,

133
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:40,385
all with the same goal:

134
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:43,287
to kill The Flash unless
we stop him together.

135
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,823
Last time we listened to
a guy with your face,

136
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,892
some bad things went down.

137
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:50,928
We lost people we cared about.

138
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,531
Everyone loses someone
they care about, Snow.

139
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,566
The real test of
character is what you do

140
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:57,768
once they're gone.

141
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,554
Joe! Put the gun down!

142
00:06:16,556 --> 00:06:18,956
How is he still alive?
How are you still alive?

143
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,025
I don't know,
because you missed?

144
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:22,726
Hey, I'm trying to keep
him from shooting you.

145
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:25,129
You're not helping. Let's
take a walk, all right?

146
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,398
It's all good.

147
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
We know someone who
can verify everything

148
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:31,802
that this guy just said.

149
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:34,205
Be careful.

150
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:35,506
I don't suppose you
have a Big Belly Burger

151
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,375
in this universe, do you?

152
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:38,776
This isn't happening.

153
00:06:38,778 --> 00:06:41,179
I know that this is
a lot to take in,

154
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,414
but that guy back in that
room, that's not Wells.

155
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,850
Dr. McGee swore she saw Wells.
He broke into Mercury Labs.

156
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:48,719
What? Why didn't
you tell me this?

157
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:50,254
Because I didn't believe her.

158
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:51,589
I didn't even want to
consider Wells was alive.

159
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:54,258
Eddie erased that
Wells from existence.

160
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,695
This guy is...
he's someone else,

161
00:06:57,697 --> 00:07:00,030
and he says he's here
to help us stop Zoom.

162
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:01,165
How can you even look at him?

163
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,933
You think this is easy for me?

164
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:06,237
The guy in there looks, moves,
sounds exactly like the guy

165
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,838
that drove a knife through
my mother's heart.

166
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,208
I have to resist the
urge to kill him.

167
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,676
I'm trying my best to
get past that, okay?

168
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:15,079
You shooting him...
that's not helping.

169
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,595
After all our losses,
I thought at least

170
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:18,999
we were free of Wells.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,170
I just want one week where
we're not surprised

172
00:07:22,171 --> 00:07:23,524
by somebody from our past.

173
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:25,313
I better go fill in Iris.

174
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,741
Good luck.

175
00:07:32,982 --> 00:07:34,174
I hope you're happy, Linda.

176
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,172
Tanner's lawyers are
threatening to sue us.

177
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:37,607
I'm sorry, Chief.

178
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,409
I don't care how many
touchdowns Tanner throws.

179
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,745
I'm not interviewing some roided
out jerk who hit his wife

180
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:43,779
unless it's to hold
him accountable

181
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:46,216
for domestic violence.

182
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:48,017
All right, run your story, Park.

183
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,187
The sports page used to be
a lot less complicated.

184
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,055
She shoots.

185
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,924
She scores.

186
00:07:54,926 --> 00:07:57,360
Larkin's the best editor
I've ever worked for.

187
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:58,961
It's just, every
once in a while,

188
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:00,430
you have to remind him
it's the 21st century.

189
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:10,973
But that's not really him,

190
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:13,309
the Wells who Eddie
gave his life to stop?

191
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,711
Apparently not.

192
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:20,816
That's life in Central
City these days, right?

193
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:23,786
- You sure?
- Dad, I'm fine, really.

194
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:26,256
Good.

195
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:27,423
I want to keep you that way.

196
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,626
- Dad.
- Take it.

197
00:08:29,628 --> 00:08:31,361
I taught you how to
use it for a reason.

198
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:33,229
And I'm praying
that Barry's right

199
00:08:33,231 --> 00:08:34,631
and this Wells means us no harm.

200
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:36,166
Last year, you had Eddie
to look out for you,

201
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:40,670
but now, you can't
murder somebody

202
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:44,774
that everybody thinks
is dead, right?

203
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,909
Put it away.

204
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:52,114
You do realize that when I said

205
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,284
I wanted a drink, I didn't
mean a latte, right?

206
00:08:54,286 --> 00:08:55,685
I was talking about alcohol.

207
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,420
Like, mind-numbing alcohol.

208
00:08:57,422 --> 00:08:59,889
All right, look, you got
give him a chance, okay?

209
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:01,624
He's not a speedster.

210
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:06,028
He's just a regular, normal
guy from another universe.

211
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,764
I never thought I'd
miss time travel.

212
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:09,965
Time travel?

213
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,934
- Hey! Are you kidding?
- Hi!

214
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:14,837
Is there a meta-human
who can time travel?

215
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,972
Time... no. Time
travel's not real.

216
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,274
'Cause that would
be pretty cool!

217
00:09:18,276 --> 00:09:20,610
Not so sure about that.

218
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:22,912
Patty, you know
Cisco Ramon, right?

219
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:25,047
Yeah, you're the scientific
advisor on meta-humans

220
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:26,316
to the CCPD, right?

221
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:28,017
- Yeah, that's me.
- Nice.

222
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,019
Hey, Barr, did you hear I
was right about King Shark?

223
00:09:30,021 --> 00:09:32,455
King Shark? Nice name.
I like her.

224
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,090
Yeah, yeah, King Shark
almost ate The Flash.

225
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:35,958
Oh, nah, I'm sure The
Flash had it handled.

226
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,893
Oh, no, I was there.
I saw it all.

227
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:39,662
Some hooded guy saved his life.

228
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,797
Wait, and you're not, like,
traumatized or anything?

229
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,133
I just watched a
half man-half shark

230
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:45,935
take on the fastest man alive.

231
00:09:45,937 --> 00:09:48,471
I love this city.

232
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:51,241
See... sorry.

233
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:52,975
Oh, uh, Captain just texted me.

234
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:56,346
He wants me to write
my police report.

235
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,314
Uh, you maybe want
to write it with me?

236
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:01,417
Uh, I can't tonight. I'm busy.
Um, yeah, sorry.

237
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:02,719
Oh, yeah, okay.

238
00:10:02,721 --> 00:10:04,520
I've just got science stuff.

239
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:07,423
Stuff I gotta science
the stuff out of.

240
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:09,024
Maybe next time.

241
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:12,395
- Yeah! Coolio.
- Yeah.

242
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:14,364
But I'm gonna actually
skip the coffee

243
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,965
and go get a head start, so...

244
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:17,567
Good to see you guys.

245
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:19,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

246
00:10:19,971 --> 00:10:21,571
- For real?
- Stop, all right?

247
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:23,873
I was gonna ask her out,
and then a man-shark

248
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,608
tried to eat me, and then Dr.
Wells the sequel showed up.

249
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,310
Okay, can we not use the name "Dr.
Wells"?

250
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:28,911
I'm just gonna call him "Harry."

251
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,480
Okay. Harry, yeah.

252
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:32,282
Listen, there's always
gonna be Harrys out there,

253
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:33,849
but you can't let the
Harrys of the world

254
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:35,718
get in the way of you
living your life.

255
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,186
Ask Patty out.

256
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,021
You gotta... you gotta be bold.

257
00:10:39,023 --> 00:10:40,556
That's tough talk.

258
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:44,927
When was the last time you
asked a girl for her number?

259
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:46,562
Watch and learn.

260
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:48,798
I'm watching.

261
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,534
Hi. What can I get you?

262
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:54,937
- Hi, there.
- Hi... again.

263
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:00,976
Do you want some coffee?

264
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:02,211
Yeah, I'll get some coffee.

265
00:11:02,213 --> 00:11:04,314
No, uh, no, I don't want coffee.

266
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:05,782
You know what I do want though?

267
00:11:05,784 --> 00:11:07,283
I want to ask you this.

268
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:10,152
Do you want to go out with me?

269
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:17,493
To... we... I mean, we could
go get coffee or we...

270
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:21,163
No.

271
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:23,199
That's a no.

272
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:26,135
That's totally cool. It's cool.

273
00:11:26,137 --> 00:11:27,503
Respect.

274
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,833
Yo, dude, you good?
It's her loss.

275
00:11:58,536 --> 00:11:59,969
Hey, what's up?

276
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:01,337
We have another breach.

277
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:02,672
What? How do you know?

278
00:12:02,674 --> 00:12:04,374
Central City Bank.
You gotta go now!

279
00:12:04,376 --> 00:12:05,375
All right.

280
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,085
You got my attention.

281
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:19,887
Flash.

282
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,670
Her name is Doctor Light.

283
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,906
Small-time thief on my
Earth until exposure

284
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:41,041
to the dark matter from
the Particle Accelerator

285
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,943
and became a meta-human
with the ability

286
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,145
to derive power from starlight.

287
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:46,680
Oh, very cool.

288
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,449
Stars having a temperature
of 5,300 degree kelvin

289
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:50,784
and a blinding
luminosity, I would say,

290
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,319
"Not very cool at all."

291
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,121
You know, our Dr. Wells
may have been evil,

292
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:55,689
but you're just a dick.

293
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,626
Okay, so obviously,
Zoom brought her here

294
00:12:58,628 --> 00:13:00,260
from your Earth like the others.

295
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:02,329
Now that we know that,

296
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:03,897
we can use that to
gain advantage.

297
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,532
What do you mean?

298
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:10,237
We capture Doctor Light and
use her to lure Zoom here.

299
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:11,772
You are insane!

300
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,941
Okay, we are not
luring Zoom anywhere!

301
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:15,208
Apparently, they
know each other,

302
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,677
and Jay is not a fan.

303
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,212
Well, well, well.

304
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:22,116
Like everyone else, I assumed
Earth-2 Flash was dead.

305
00:13:22,118 --> 00:13:24,118
Why am I not surprised to
find Jay Garrick here,

306
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,255
still alive and in hiding a
full universe away from Zoom?

307
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,723
I'm not in hiding.

308
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,660
Zoom nearly killed me
and stole my speed

309
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:34,361
before the Singularity
pulled me here.

310
00:13:34,363 --> 00:13:35,863
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

311
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:38,265
Well, whatever the
case, in your absence,

312
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:41,869
Zoom has only gotten
more powerful, faster.

313
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,838
Barry, you have to defeat
Zoom now while you still can.

314
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,640
No, this isn't the
time to be reckless.

315
00:13:46,642 --> 00:13:48,508
We don't even know why Zoom
sent Doctor Light here.

316
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,243
She's a thief, not a killer.

317
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,012
Zoom can make people do
things out of character.

318
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:53,781
Thief or not, she'll kill you.

319
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:55,215
All right, look, hey,

320
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,350
we can decide what to
do with Light later.

321
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,887
First, we have to
find her, okay?

322
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,326
Hey, how did you know

323
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:08,228
that she was breaking
into the bank?

324
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,165
I got an alert on my phone.

325
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,167
There's a little ring-a-ding

326
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:14,467
every time, like, there's
a robbery at a bank.

327
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,036
- What?
- But you know what?

328
00:14:16,038 --> 00:14:17,938
I think I can get the S.T.A.R.
Labs satellite

329
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,307
to scan for any irregular
solar radiation emissions

330
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,643
and we can find
Doctor Light's light.

331
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:27,981
Okay, I'm gonna also call Joe,
see if CCPD has any leads.

332
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:30,818
Why don't we keep them
apart until I get back?

333
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,420
I am sure that won't
be a problem.

334
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:39,694
CENTRAL CITY POLICE

335
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:45,665
- Hey!
- Hey.

336
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,334
How's your science stuff?

337
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:48,535
I finished it.

338
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:50,137
Um, did you get
your report done?

339
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,671
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:55,142
It wasn't as much fun writing
it by myself, but...

341
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,376
I'll see ya.

342
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,212
Yeah.

343
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:02,616
Hey, do you ever feel
completely overwhelmed

344
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:03,884
by everything that you
have to do in a day

345
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:05,518
and it feels like the one thing

346
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,521
that you actually want to do
is the thing that gets lost?

347
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,190
I'm confused. What?

348
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:13,827
I've been thinking, for
a while now actually,

349
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,629
would you want to get
dinner with me sometime?

350
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:18,098
Yeah, this isn't gonna
be one those things

351
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,768
where I get really excited
and then, you know,

352
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,269
more science stuff
comes up, right?

353
00:15:22,271 --> 00:15:25,372
No, no, that's not...
um, tomorrow?

354
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:26,874
We can grab an early dinner.

355
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:29,476
I don't want to wait anymore.

356
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:33,914
Okay. Looking forward to it.

357
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:43,270
DR. WELLS LEAVES CENTRAL
CITY IN BLACK HOLE

358
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:45,034
S.T.A.R. LABS DISASTER
ONE MONTH LATER

359
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:47,695
WELLS CONFESSES TO NORA
ALLEN MURDER POST MORTUM

360
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,297
Hey, Harry.

361
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,365
Hey, over here.

362
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,734
Hey!

363
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:57,971
Come inside. Use my workroom.
Use my computer!

364
00:15:57,973 --> 00:15:59,873
- I don't care!
- Thanks.

365
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,775
You and Wells prime have very
different musical tastes.

366
00:16:01,777 --> 00:16:03,210
His were better.

367
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,379
This Harrison Wells and
I are very different

368
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:07,815
but similar in some respects.

369
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:09,883
I see he made almost
the same mistake I did

370
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,285
with the Particle Accelerator.

371
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,886
He did a lot of terrible things,

372
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,222
and none of them
were by mistake.

373
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,258
What did he do to you?

374
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,860
I know he caused
the Singularity,

375
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:21,929
murdered Barry's mother,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

376
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:23,396
What did he do to you?

377
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,398
You can barely look
me in the eye.

378
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,201
Why is that? What
did he do to you?

379
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,437
He shoved his hand
through my chest.

380
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,604
He stopped my heart.

381
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:36,409
Okay, that would do it,

382
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:38,912
but you survived that.

383
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,482
Only because Barry
erased that timeline.

384
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:44,818
I see. Barry traveled in time.

385
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,256
Twice.

386
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,524
- Here's how it is.
- What's the deal?

387
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:53,126
You don't have to like me.

388
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:54,794
I don't like you,

389
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:58,131
but you have to work with me
to stop Zoom and Doctor Light.

390
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,868
Can you do that?

391
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,169
I guess we'll see, won't we?

392
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:04,104
I guess we will.

393
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,106
One more thing...

394
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,507
you said you were
going to re-task

395
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,309
the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite?

396
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:11,611
To scan for solar emissions,
yeah, we're up and running.

397
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,812
I'd like to examine
your program.

398
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,147
I want to see if it works.

399
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:16,316
Don't worry. It'll work.

400
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:25,359
Harry's starting to
get on my nerves.

401
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:27,794
The silent alarm just went off
at the Bank of Central City.

402
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,163
- That's gotta be Doctor Light.
- Could be a trap.

403
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,132
Barry, trust me, Doctor
Light is not a killer.

404
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,935
- You can talk to her.
- Okay.

405
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,982
Looking for this?

406
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,984
I know Zoom sent you
here to kill me.

407
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,786
Good news, you don't
have to do that.

408
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:54,388
Not if I can get out of
town with that cash.

409
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,989
And then what?

410
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,857
Zoom's not gonna like that
you ditched him, right?

411
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,626
My friends and I can help you.

412
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:02,729
Nobody can protect me from Zoom!

413
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:03,964
All right, why don't
we take it down

414
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:06,566
a lumen, have a
normal conversation,

415
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:08,902
all right?

416
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,637
Thank you.

417
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,574
Linda?

418
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:17,344
- Linda Park?
- How do you know my name?

419
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,346
I don't understand.

420
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,349
This was a mistake.

421
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,322
Barry, what's happening?

422
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:31,591
I can't see. Guys, I can't see.

423
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,907
I still can't see.

424
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,442
How long is this gonna last?

425
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,344
You're suffering from
solar retinopathy.

426
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:43,413
Your retinas are
severely damaged.

427
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,981
You're lucky you're not
permanently blind.

428
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,983
But with your rapid
regeneration abilities,

429
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:48,218
your sight should return soon.

430
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,019
6.25 hours by my estimation.

431
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:51,854
All this could have been avoided
if you just stopped Light

432
00:18:51,856 --> 00:18:53,423
instead of
chitchatting with her.

433
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,924
She caught Barry off guard.

434
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,859
Always an excuse
with you, right?

435
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,894
He's the fastest man alive. How
could she possibly do that?

436
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:01,231
Because Light looks exactly
like my ex-girlfriend,

437
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:03,233
Linda Park.

438
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:05,868
That's why Zoom sent her...
because he knew you'd hesitate.

439
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,703
That means Zoom had
to have known somehow

440
00:19:07,705 --> 00:19:09,339
that Linda was your ex.

441
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,307
Which is why Barry
has to act now,

442
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:13,643
before Zoom sends another
double from Barry's life.

443
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:15,411
All right, right now, I'm
more worried about Linda.

444
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,714
When I saw who was under
the mask, I said her name.

445
00:19:18,716 --> 00:19:20,450
What if Light didn't even
realize that she had

446
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:22,318
a doppelganger here until
I accidentally told her?

447
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,120
The first thing that
Atom Smasher did

448
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,422
when he crossed the breach was
to kill his doppelganger.

449
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:28,258
Yeah, but Light's not
like Atom Smasher.

450
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,959
We should keep an
eye on your Linda.

451
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,861
All right, I'll go.

452
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:33,029
Sorry.

453
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:34,230
- Bro.
- Barry!

454
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:36,399
- What?
- Okay, okay.

455
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:38,768
You can't do anything
until your sight returns.

456
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,538
No, no, no, come on, here's
the little rail here.

457
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,207
- I'll do it.
- I'll go with you!

458
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:45,708
- Hey, Barry!
- Hey.

459
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,411
I came as soon as I heard...

460
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,280
You look just like him.

461
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,933
I'm guessing my counterpart did
something to offend her as well?

462
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,117
Her fianc?died because of him.

463
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:03,893
Iris, I know it's
weird seeing him.

464
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:05,928
Yeah, it's just a lot
to process lately.

465
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,264
Wells, my mother.

466
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,833
How are you doing with
that, by the way?

467
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:14,170
I mean, now that she's gone,

468
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,206
okay.

469
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,074
Yeah, Iris, um, look...

470
00:20:18,076 --> 00:20:19,242
Yeah.

471
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:20,543
Thanks.

472
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:22,512
You know you can
talk to me about it.

473
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,548
Yeah, I know, but
really, I'm fine, okay?

474
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,283
I should be asking
how you're doing.

475
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:29,885
That's me. I got it.

476
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:31,721
- Barry, let me help you.
- I got it.

477
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:33,889
All right.

478
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:36,693
Uh, "Running a little late. P."

479
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:37,627
Who's P?

480
00:20:38,482 --> 00:20:39,862
P.

481
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,797
- That's Patty.
- My dad's partner Patty?

482
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,300
What is she running late for?

483
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:47,437
Um, our first date.

484
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:50,306
That's so great! She's great.

485
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:52,508
Yeah, no, Patty's great.
I just, you know...

486
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,176
I doubt she's gonna
give me another shot

487
00:20:54,178 --> 00:20:55,378
when I have to cancel on her.

488
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,912
Don't cancel.

489
00:20:56,914 --> 00:20:59,482
I'm blind, Iris. A
literal blind date.

490
00:20:59,484 --> 00:21:00,550
It's not gonna work.

491
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,051
Hey, we are in S.T.A.R. Labs.

492
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,453
Come on, there's gotta
be something here

493
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:05,087
that can help you get
through the night.

494
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,223
Yeah.

495
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,959
Or someone.

496
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,864
Cisco, hey!

497
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:18,033
- To your left. Other left.
- Cisco.

498
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:25,308
Sorry.

499
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:29,912
Sorry.

500
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:32,991
Okay. She's two steps
in front of you.

501
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:36,437
- Nice glasses.
- Hey, hey!

502
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:38,832
- Touchdown.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

503
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,037
- I...
- No, don't be.

504
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:42,191
I... You know, I actually judge
my dates on whether or not

505
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:44,630
they stand me up, so you
are off to a great start.

506
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:46,381
What do you mean? Who
would stand you up?

507
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:47,631
I have a reputation.

508
00:21:47,632 --> 00:21:51,701
Not that kind of reputation.
That's not what I meant.

509
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:53,703
That's embarrassing.

510
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:56,038
You know, I actually... I
arrested a boyfriend once.

511
00:21:57,409 --> 00:21:59,409
A very ex-boyfriend,
while we were at dinner.

512
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:02,412
He got really wasted and decided
to insult the waitress,

513
00:22:02,414 --> 00:22:04,547
so I cited him for
public intoxication.

514
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:06,749
- That is hilarious.
- Yeah.

515
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:09,752
Special.

516
00:22:09,754 --> 00:22:11,987
So...

517
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:13,489
Dude, she looks amazing.

518
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:15,325
You have to tell her
how amazing she looks.

519
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,427
You look amazing, Patty.

520
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:20,396
Uh, thanks, I actually
had a really hard time

521
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:22,198
trying to figure out
what to wear, like,

522
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,067
if I should wear a dress or if
this color was a little weird.

523
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:26,636
No, you look great.

524
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:30,740
Um, yeah, no, that... what
would you call that color?

525
00:22:32,355 --> 00:22:32,942
I can't tell.

526
00:22:32,944 --> 00:22:34,544
- The feed's black and white.
- I don't know.

527
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:36,846
Yeah, whatever it is, that
color should thank you

528
00:22:36,848 --> 00:22:38,214
for wearing it.

529
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:40,015
My man.

530
00:22:40,017 --> 00:22:42,785
- Smooth.
- Not smooth.

531
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:46,823
Oh, wine list. Here we go.

532
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:51,093
Uh, yes, uh, got it. Thank you.

533
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,864
Um, you know, why don't you...

534
00:22:54,866 --> 00:22:56,432
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay.

535
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:58,267
The guy always picks.
Why don't you choose?

536
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:02,338
Yeah, what do you
want, red or white?

537
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,440
Whatever you'd like. Uh, yeah.

538
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:06,809
You got this. Why do
you even need me?

539
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:16,352
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

540
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:17,453
Classic stakeout fuel.

541
00:23:17,455 --> 00:23:18,788
Yeah.

542
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,690
You have coffee on
your Earth, right?

543
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:23,092
I think coffee's the one
constant in the multiverse.

544
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:29,098
So I don't mean to pry, but
when Wells keeps referring

545
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,868
to you and Zoom, what's
he talking about?

546
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,703
I fought Zoom many times,

547
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,938
each time barely
escaping with my life.

548
00:23:37,776 --> 00:23:39,776
So yeah.

549
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:41,811
Maybe I didn't always confront
him when I should have.

550
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:43,312
Truth is, Zoom scared me.

551
00:23:43,314 --> 00:23:47,483
He stole the most precioushing
from me: my speed.

552
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:49,519
I didn't want Barry to
suffer the same fate.

553
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,954
Well, maybe if you just
sat down with Wells,

554
00:23:51,956 --> 00:23:53,456
talked to him about it...

555
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,458
No, no, no. Do not
trust Wells, Caitlin.

556
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,026
The guy was more than
happy to make money

557
00:23:57,028 --> 00:23:58,895
off the meta-human problem
with his tech apps,

558
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,797
and now he's obsessed with Zoom.

559
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,099
Something has changed and not
just because I disappeared.

560
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:09,705
Well, I don't trust Wells.
I trust you.

561
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:15,978
So I've actually been
dying to ask you,

562
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,313
what was it like to be
struck by lightning?

563
00:24:17,315 --> 00:24:20,883
Life-changing, to be honest.

564
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:22,485
Did it hurt?

565
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:25,087
I mean, all I really remember
is feeling electricity

566
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,489
surging through my body.

567
00:24:26,491 --> 00:24:28,558
It was an intensity
I had never felt,

568
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,162
like I was instantly connected
to everything around me.

569
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:35,331
Then I woke up from a
coma nine months later.

570
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,066
Waking up in the
future like that,

571
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:39,902
it's like time travel.

572
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:42,805
- Sort of, yeah.
- Yeah.

573
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:46,442
When I was nine, I
actually drowned.

574
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,043
I hit my head on
the diving board

575
00:24:48,045 --> 00:24:49,712
and fell into the swimming pool.

576
00:24:49,714 --> 00:24:52,748
Uh, my heart stopped for,
I think, two minutes

577
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,518
until my dad rescued
me and saved my life.

578
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,886
Yeah.

579
00:24:56,888 --> 00:24:59,889
So I guess we've
both cheated death.

580
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:03,292
I've been through a
few things in my life

581
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,461
that taught me not to
be afraid of anything.

582
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,096
I think fear is what
holds people back

583
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:09,164
from being who they should be.

584
00:25:09,813 --> 00:25:11,467
Preach!

585
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:14,436
Yeah, I'm still here,
creepin' and peepin'.

586
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:15,905
You okay?

587
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:19,675
Sorry, I just... yeah, I
really agree with that.

588
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:21,544
Really?

589
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:27,016
I think another thing, too,
I think you can't see me.

590
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:29,719
- Abort!
- What? What do you mean?

591
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:31,554
I think you can't see me.

592
00:25:31,556 --> 00:25:33,155
Come on, I would not
be a good detective

593
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,657
if I couldn't have
figured this one out.

594
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,593
I don't know.

595
00:25:37,595 --> 00:25:40,496
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

596
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:43,966
I'm really sorry and embarrassed

597
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:45,367
I didn't say anything.

598
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:48,470
- I had my pupils dilated earlier.
- Barry.

599
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:50,172
- Oh, my God!
- Barry!

600
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,608
And I really didn't
want to cancel.

601
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,612
Barry! I lost my eyes!

602
00:25:56,614 --> 00:25:59,982
No, you have a great smile.

603
00:25:59,984 --> 00:26:02,618
Really, how do you
know I'm smiling?

604
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,753
Just a hunch.

605
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:09,625
Okay, so what else is
different about our worlds?

606
00:26:09,627 --> 00:26:11,527
Do you have Tahiti?

607
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,996
Never been, but I
do love Atlantis.

608
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:15,932
As in the lost city submerged
in the ocean somewhere?

609
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:18,500
Well, it's actually above
water on my Earth.

610
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:19,936
One of my best friends
is from there.

611
00:26:19,938 --> 00:26:21,336
I would love to see it.

612
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:23,839
It's special.

613
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:26,809
It's the kind of place
you never want to leave.

614
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:55,972
Hello, gorgeous.

615
00:26:55,974 --> 00:26:57,673
- Everybody out, now!
- Go!

616
00:26:57,675 --> 00:27:00,910
Go, go, go. Go, move, quick.

617
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,178
- Except you.
- I don't think so.

618
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,780
No, no, she's leaving with us.

619
00:27:04,782 --> 00:27:07,783
- Not today.
- What do you want from me?

620
00:27:07,785 --> 00:27:09,685
Your life.

621
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:16,175
Doctor Light.

622
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,631
Oh, no. Go.

623
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:26,752
I've never killed anyone before,

624
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:28,554
but it's not murder if
it'ur double, right?

625
00:27:28,556 --> 00:27:30,056
Why are you doing this?

626
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:32,358
It's the only way that
I can stay alive.

627
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,893
To become you.

628
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:35,194
I'm sorry, Linda.

629
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:40,132
No!

630
00:27:44,438 --> 00:27:47,273
- How is this possible?
- You couldn't understand.

631
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:49,342
Light!

632
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:50,709
Flash.

633
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:53,112
I thought I took
care of you outside.

634
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:05,724
Please don't let go. I may trip.

635
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,227
Okay, I won't. I promise.

636
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:10,963
- Two more steps.
- All right. Missed one.

637
00:28:10,965 --> 00:28:13,599
There you go.

638
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:16,068
It's funny how we skipped

639
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,871
straight to the
hand-holding part.

640
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:21,874
Yes.

641
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:24,777
We, uh, have arrived
at my car, so...

642
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:32,518
Well, do you think we've reached
the good night kiss stage?

643
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:55,674
Um, this is burgundy,
by the way,

644
00:28:55,676 --> 00:28:57,176
and you look great in it.

645
00:28:57,178 --> 00:28:59,979
- Now you can see?
- Yeah, I can.

646
00:28:59,981 --> 00:29:02,248
That must have been some kiss.

647
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,517
I guess so.

648
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,821
- Sorry.
- No, it's mine too.

649
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:10,889
Weird. Cisco, hey.

650
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:12,724
Sir?

651
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:19,198
I saw myself.

652
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,567
How is that even possible?

653
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:24,870
Sounds like you have
an evil meta-twin.

654
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:29,008
And now Larkin's dead

655
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,810
because someone who looks
like me wanted to kill me?

656
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,379
Linda, none of this
is your fault.

657
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:35,714
We're gonna figure it
all out, I promise.

658
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,383
How you doing?

659
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:41,053
I'm alive, thanks to Iris.

660
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,956
Turns out she's as badass with
a gun as she is with a pen.

661
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,424
Yeah, she is.

662
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:46,758
I'm just happy that you're safe.

663
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,327
I've arranged a security detail

664
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:49,795
around the clock,
just to be sure.

665
00:29:49,797 --> 00:29:51,663
I can take you to
them if you're ready.

666
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,966
Yeah.

667
00:29:58,106 --> 00:29:59,938
This is because of me.
I should've been here.

668
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,340
Barry, you were blind.

669
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,109
There's nothing that
you could have done.

670
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:05,277
You think this mask can
help us find that woman?

671
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,779
Any evidence on this is
just gonna match Linda.

672
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,681
I'll think in something else.

673
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,817
Light's not gonna kill again.

674
00:30:14,588 --> 00:30:16,555
Caitlin, are you guys okay?

675
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:19,158
- Yeah.
- Barry, I'm sorry.

676
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,493
Doctor Light's never
killed before.

677
00:30:20,495 --> 00:30:22,294
I thought we could
reason with her.

678
00:30:22,296 --> 00:30:25,964
You cannot reason with someone
under Zoom's influence,

679
00:30:25,966 --> 00:30:28,434
and now a man is dead
because of you, Garrick.

680
00:30:28,436 --> 00:30:30,269
This whole thing
is because of you.

681
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:31,937
He doubts himself
because of you,

682
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:34,606
but believe me, Barry can
do what you could not.

683
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:36,108
Barry can stop Zoom.

684
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,910
I spent two years hunting Zoom.

685
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:41,313
Wrong! Zoom hunted you!

686
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:43,282
You spent the last two
years of your life

687
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:45,784
running, running,
running from Zoom.

688
00:30:45,786 --> 00:30:48,120
Zoom would have killed me
just like he will kill Barry

689
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:49,688
if you lead him down this path!

690
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,557
No, because he is not like you.

691
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:54,060
Barry runs towards
danger, not from it,

692
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:56,228
because Barry's not a coward.

693
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:09,841
Enough!

694
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:15,647
You were pretty hard
on Jay in there.

695
00:31:15,649 --> 00:31:19,618
Maybe you should be
hard on Jay too.

696
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,253
I've seen what you
can do, Barry.

697
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:23,655
I've calculated how
fast you can run,

698
00:31:23,657 --> 00:31:26,892
and you should be teaching
Jay, not the other way around.

699
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:33,966
You know, before I learned
that the other Wells

700
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:37,869
was the man who murdered my
mom, I looked up to him.

701
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:40,038
He was my mentor, actually.

702
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:47,346
So my doppelganger,

703
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:49,748
a man who looks exactly like me,

704
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,717
betrayed you.

705
00:31:53,053 --> 00:31:55,321
I'm sorry, I'm not him,

706
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:58,190
so you need to listen to
me when I say you can

707
00:31:58,192 --> 00:32:02,328
take care of Zoom, and
all we have to do

708
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,130
is capture Doctor Light.

709
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:07,933
I thought about testing
the mask for Light's DNA,

710
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:09,435
but it would only have Linda's.

711
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:12,538
The mask, what mask?

712
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,072
Light's mask.

713
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,177
How did you get this?

714
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,212
Iris shot it off Doctor Light
when she attacked Linda.

715
00:32:20,214 --> 00:32:22,181
You know how to use the
mask to find Light?

716
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:23,449
Yes, I do.

717
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:26,118
All we have to do
is give it to him.

718
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,286
Why me?

719
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:30,389
Because you have powers.

720
00:32:32,393 --> 00:32:35,894
What are you talking about?

721
00:32:35,896 --> 00:32:39,097
I developed this watch
to detect meta-humans.

722
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:49,708
You never got an
alert on your phone.

723
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:55,347
You never reprogrammed the S.T.A.R.
Labs satellite,

724
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,882
and this is why.

725
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,119
He's a meta-human.

726
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,371
Cisco, have you known about this

727
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:10,024
and you didn't say
anything to us?

728
00:33:10,025 --> 00:33:11,991
Yeah, I was gonna tell you.

729
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:13,159
Thanks a lot, Harry.

730
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:17,997
I swear I was, but I didn't.

731
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:21,501
- I was just... I was afraid.
- Afraid of what?

732
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:25,672
Dr. Wells said the dark matter
gave me this, this gift.

733
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:30,677
He said that one day
I'd thank him for it.

734
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:32,479
What if I become like him?

735
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:36,049
Cisco, I don't think any
of us would become evil

736
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:37,383
if we all of sudden got powers,

737
00:33:37,385 --> 00:33:38,952
even if they were from Dr.
Wells.

738
00:33:38,954 --> 00:33:43,222
Yeah, maybe you're right.

739
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:45,291
I should have said something.

740
00:33:45,293 --> 00:33:47,126
That's my fault. I'm sorry.

741
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:48,528
Well, you can be sorry later,

742
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,129
because right now, we
have to use your powers

743
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:51,565
to find Doctor Light.

744
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:54,935
Cisco, your abilities,
how do they work?

745
00:33:54,937 --> 00:33:57,471
Uh, I get these
feelings sometimes,

746
00:33:57,473 --> 00:34:00,440
these vibes, visions
of the breachers

747
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:01,908
when they come to this Earth.

748
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,543
I just... I'm not sure
what triggers it.

749
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:05,479
Sometimes it just happens.

750
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:08,281
Sometimes it's when I'm
touching something of theirs.

751
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:10,383
Touch the mask.

752
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:12,686
You want to find
Doctor Light, do it.

753
00:34:37,312 --> 00:34:38,478
I don't think it's working.

754
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,446
Try again.

755
00:34:41,917 --> 00:34:43,562
Try again!

756
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:55,328
- I'm sorry, it's not...
- Again!

757
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,631
- I can't control it.
- Because you're afraid.

758
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:59,198
I'm telling you I don't
know how it works!

759
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,867
I can't just make it happen!

760
00:35:00,869 --> 00:35:03,570
I'm telling you, yes, you can!

761
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:16,315
South Plaza train
station, platform 15.

762
00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:19,118
What are you waiting for?

763
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:28,862
Oh, guys, the
platform's crowded.

764
00:35:28,864 --> 00:35:30,229
Are you sure she's here?

765
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:31,731
She should be wearing
a black trench coat.

766
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,868
Black trench coat. Found her.

767
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,471
Everybody, get out of here.
Go, go, hurry!

768
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:44,177
Why won't you just let me leave?

769
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:46,746
I can't let you leave. You
killed an innocent man.

770
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,114
That was an accident.

771
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:50,249
Trying to kill
Linda Park wasn't.

772
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:52,819
It's the only way that I
can be free from Zoom,

773
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:54,120
unless I kill you.

774
00:35:54,122 --> 00:35:55,722
I can't let you do that either,

775
00:35:55,724 --> 00:35:57,223
so we've got a problem.

776
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:59,292
We'll see.

777
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:01,160
Guys, should have talked
about this before I left,

778
00:36:01,162 --> 00:36:02,462
but how should I stop her?

779
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:03,630
Keep trying different
angles, Barry.

780
00:36:03,632 --> 00:36:05,164
Find her blind spot.

781
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:12,271
I can't get close enough.
What should I do?

782
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:13,807
I don't know.

783
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,308
I gotta tell ya,
that's not exactly

784
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,543
the answer I was looking for.

785
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:19,079
You need to confuse her.

786
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,346
Give her more than one target,

787
00:36:20,348 --> 00:36:21,781
so she does not know
who to fire at.

788
00:36:21,783 --> 00:36:23,483
All right, how do I do that?

789
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:26,319
By running so fast, you
create multiple afterimages

790
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:29,022
of yourself, you
create a speed mirage.

791
00:36:29,024 --> 00:36:32,291
A wha... speed Mir...
I've never run that fast.

792
00:36:32,293 --> 00:36:33,727
Well, from what I've been told,

793
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:35,161
you've traveled through time.

794
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:37,063
You'll be more than fast enough.

795
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:38,898
Okay.

796
00:36:55,984 --> 00:36:58,251
- Barry?
- I can't do it.

797
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,720
- Yes, you can, Barry.
- Hey, Dr. Wells is right.

798
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:02,756
You are fast, faster
than I ever was

799
00:37:02,758 --> 00:37:04,423
and better than I ever will be.

800
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:06,726
Don't let fear and doubt hold
you back like it did to me.

801
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,128
You're The Flash, Barry.

802
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,229
Show Light what that means.

803
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,442
Where are you?

804
00:37:28,516 --> 00:37:31,051
I'm right here.

805
00:37:35,394 --> 00:37:37,640
Doctor Light is safely
locked in the pipeline.

806
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:39,774
Nicely done.

807
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:42,677
Wells, thank you
for helping Barry

808
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,711
put away Doctor Light.

809
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:45,513
So what now?

810
00:37:46,235 --> 00:37:48,650
We do what Dr. Wells said.

811
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:51,786
We use her to lure Zoom here,
end this once and for all.

812
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:53,087
You can't be serious.

813
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:54,522
More breachers are gonna come.

814
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:55,990
More innocent people may die.

815
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:58,126
I can't let this happen anymore.

816
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,794
You're making a mistake.

817
00:37:59,796 --> 00:38:03,230
Ok, Zoom is a nightmare
you can't wake up from.

818
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:05,700
I've already had my
worst nightmare.

819
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,168
His name was Reverse Flash,

820
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,071
and I spent a long time
being afraid of him.

821
00:38:10,073 --> 00:38:12,406
I'm not gonna be afraid anymore.

822
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:14,742
Okay, Barry.

823
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,477
You may be faster than me,

824
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:18,846
but you're not ready to
fight Zoom by yourself.

825
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:20,815
That's just it, Jay.

826
00:38:20,817 --> 00:38:22,449
I'm not gonna fight
him by myself.

827
00:38:22,451 --> 00:38:24,118
I've got all of them to help me.

828
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,121
I've got Dr. Wells.

829
00:38:27,123 --> 00:38:29,190
I've got you.

830
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,661
No, I can't in good conscience
help you when I know

831
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:36,297
it'll only lead to you
losing your speed,

832
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:38,132
or even worse,

833
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:40,134
your death.

834
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:43,071
Optimism must be
an Earth-1 thing.

835
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:46,808
You all need to ask yourself
why this man, for years,

836
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,776
wouldn't admit that
he was responsible

837
00:38:48,778 --> 00:38:51,345
for the Particle Accelerator
exploding underground.

838
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:54,749
He may not be Harrison
Wells from your Earth,

839
00:38:54,751 --> 00:38:57,952
but he has just as many
secrets as the one you knew.

840
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,957
Jay, please don't go.

841
00:39:05,061 --> 00:39:07,161
I'm so sorry, Caitlin.

842
00:39:15,571 --> 00:39:17,138
Have a nice day.

843
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,940
What can I get... you?

844
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:21,075
Yeah, I know, this
is supes awkward,

845
00:39:21,077 --> 00:39:22,610
probably more for
me than for you,

846
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:24,645
but I just want coffee, okay?

847
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:27,414
Just three flashes,
one of them decaf.

848
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,016
That's it.

849
00:39:32,555 --> 00:39:35,757
Are you sure that's
all you want?

850
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:36,991
Oh, that's funny.

851
00:39:36,993 --> 00:39:38,359
You just want to
shoot me down again?

852
00:39:38,361 --> 00:39:40,795
No, no, no, no.

853
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:45,233
What I mean is, I just
moved to Central City,

854
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:48,535
and it's a pretty big change
from where I come from.

855
00:39:48,537 --> 00:39:50,337
Everything here
is so big and new

856
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:52,673
and filled with meta-humans.

857
00:39:52,675 --> 00:39:55,843
Yeah, well, when you factor
in the size of the city,

858
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:58,379
the chances of running
into a meta-human are

859
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,613
actually pretty low.

860
00:40:01,017 --> 00:40:02,616
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

861
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:06,154
you kinda caught me off
guard the other day,

862
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:08,189
but now I'm a little
more prepared,

863
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:12,894
so I just want to make sure,
is coffee all you want?

864
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,033
Hi, I'm Cisco Ramon.

865
00:40:19,035 --> 00:40:21,068
Kendra Saunders.

866
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,837
It's nice to meet you.

867
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:24,205
Are you okay?

868
00:40:24,207 --> 00:40:25,973
Yeah, I just...

869
00:40:25,975 --> 00:40:28,642
I was getting used to Jay
being part of the team.

870
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:31,179
Well, look, Jay is a hero.

871
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,782
They always seem to show
up just when you need 'em.

872
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:37,518
Yo, peep that.

873
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,288
That's how it's done,
young Padawan.

874
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,655
- Nice.
- Going on a date next week.

875
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:43,457
Things are looking
up for Cisco Ramon.

876
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:44,658
I guess so.

877
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,260
Still stuck with these
powers, though.

878
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:47,862
Just don't know how
to feel about 'em.

879
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,563
Hey, look,

880
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:51,565
you don't gotta go
through it alone.

881
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:54,235
And now you need a cool name.

882
00:40:54,237 --> 00:40:57,705
Oh, snap! You're totally right.

883
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,640
I gotta think about this one.

884
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:00,975
Well, you know me.
It's gotta be perfect.

885
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:03,096
Something that really
sings, you know?

886
00:41:03,813 --> 00:41:05,847
Something like...

887
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:07,748
Vibe?

888
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,784
Vibe.

889
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:13,354
Vibe.

890
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:26,241
-TUSUBTITULO-
-IS NOT OVER YET-

891
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:30,370
EARTH TWO

892
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:35,943
Your father has abandoned you.

893
00:41:35,945 --> 00:41:37,378
You're lying!

894
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,014
My father's the
smartest man alive.

895
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:44,118
He'll find me, he'll save me,
and then he'll kill you.

896
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,155
I will not die.

897
00:41:48,157 --> 00:41:51,125
What happens to you
and your father

898
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:54,395
is still to be decided.
