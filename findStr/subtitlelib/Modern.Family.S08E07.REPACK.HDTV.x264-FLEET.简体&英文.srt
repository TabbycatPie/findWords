都怪我的医生烦人

我就开始唱70年代的慢摇滚

稍等一下
One second.

104
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,970
你为什么要那么叫我

卢克莫名其妙在主席竞选中赢了我

而我到现在还无法释怀
and I still can't get over it.

107
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,090
毫不夸张地说  人类离骑在马背上
Not to be hyperbolic, but humans are a decade away

108
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,090
跟人猿战斗的年代已经不远了

你是想告诉我
You're trying to tell me

110
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,950
这里一切都很正常吗
that there's absolutely nothing weird going on here?

111

你穿的就像乡村背景的
You are dressed like a character

112
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,540
《人鼠之间》加强版的角色
out of "It's Raining Mice and Men".

113
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,840
我完全不知道你在说啥
I don't know what you're talking about, okay?

114
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,480
我享受这场派对可是多过享受
I am enjoying this more than a farm animal

115
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,160
某次看残疾农场动物在做...

非常坏的事

120
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,830
我需要先把小卡哄开心了才敢告诉他
I need Cam in a good mood before I tell him.

121
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,860
你出轨了吗  听起来像是出轨了

-我不能说  -米奇尔

轮到你来体会搅乳桶的炽热了
It's your turn to feel the burn on the churn!

124
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,780
那我最好脚底抹"油"  冲去搅"黄油"啦
Well, then I "butter" get over there.

125
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,770
好啊  来吧
Okay, come on!

126
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,240

所以他们这么刚好家里有
So, did they just happen to have this costume

129
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,590
这件符合你大小的制服吗
lying around in your size?

130
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,990
虽然很诡异  但确实如此
Weirdly, they did.

131
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,660
不不不  德怀特
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, Dwight

下周有本赛季最重要的比赛之一

133
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,340
我不能让你把他弄生病了
and I can't have you getting him sick.

134
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,510
我的单核细胞增多症已经好了
Yeah, I'm over the mono.

135
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,580
但还是有可能有传染性
But it could still be contagious,

136
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,600
而我想到一个适合你的有趣造型
and I have a fun costume idea for you.

137
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,840
打扮成旧时代的银行抢匪怎么样
How about being an old-timey bank robber?

138
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,290
要在警长赶到之前把脸遮住
You gotta cover that face before the marshal gets to town.

139
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,510
发生什么事了
Hi! Oh, what happened?

140
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,850
没什么  就是做了个韩式激光换肤
Oh, nothing, just a Korean laser peel.

141
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,260
超级疼  但是皮肤新生出来以后
Hurt like hell, but once the skin regenerates,

142
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,570
能让我这双赚钱的手年轻十岁
it's gonna take ten years off these money makers.

143
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:40,570
她来了
Hey! There she is.

144
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,880
多谢你送她过来

146
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,180
所以我邀请他来跟我们一起过感恩节

147
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,910
我超爱这个乡村主题
I am loving this country theme!

148
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,330
让我想起当初给塔尔萨市的十二新闻台
This reminds me of when I worked for Newscenter Twelve

149
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,030
工作的日子  除了这里没有刻薄的醉汉
in Tulsa, except no one here's bitter and drunk.

150
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,490
我就怕你待在这里会觉得格格不入
Gosh, I would hate for you to feel weird, though,

151
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,180
毕竟这可是家庭聚会
since this is just for family.

152
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,390
我们的老邻居杰瑞是不是
Isn't that our old neighbor, Jerry,

153
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,520
正在往自封袋里装前菜
stuffing appetizers into a ziplock?

154
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,470
雷纳  我们很欢迎你留下
You know what, Rainer, you are more than welcome to stay.

155

谢谢
Thank you.

156
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,490
好吧  我觉得最重要的是
Okay, well, I guess the main thing

157
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,970
邓菲家的人都能齐聚在此
is all the Dunphys are here.

158
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,800
雷纳  明天天气会怎样
Hey, Rainer, what's the weather going to be like for tomorrow?

159
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
晴空万里  温度最高在23摄氏度左右
Clear and sunny skies, highs in the mid 70s,

160
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,690
但伞还是不能忘了  因为周一...
but hang onto that umbrella 'cause Monday...

161
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,580
我只想知道明天的
Yeah, I just needed tomorrow,

162
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,400
因为明天是我们的家庭橄榄球赛
because that's when we're having our big family football game.

163
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
还记得去年吗
Remember last year?

164
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,720
我们用的那战术
We ran that play?

165
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,040
海利式超远长传
The Haley Mary?

166
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,930
可是明天我们...
Uh, but tomorrow we're supposed...

167
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,670
预计是晴天吗  你说过了
To have sunny weather? Yeah, you said that.

168
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,920
雷纳周末要带我去卡波
Rainer's taking me to Cabo for the weekend.

169
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,440
{\an8}卡波圣卢卡斯  墨西哥海边度假胜地

170
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,440
所以我有个问题
So, I had a problem.

171
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,970
我不知道我的吹风机
I wasn't sure if my hairdryer

172
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,150
用墨西哥的电还能不能运转
ran on Mexican electricity.

173
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,180
还有  要怎么告诉我爸
Oh, and telling my dad.

174
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,770
我有两个问题了
I had two problems.

175
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,440
医生把这称为"癔病性阳痿"
Doctor's call it "Hysterical impotence."

176
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,120
就是说身体上没毛病
There's nothing physically wrong, per se.

177
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,010
但因为我离婚的创伤
But because of my divorce trauma,

178
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,610
可能影响到了我下面的小兄弟
I guess I'm rewired down there.

179
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,980
-我懂了  -时髦都市人
- I get it. - Okay, city slickers,

180
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,420
猜猜谁家后院里有个真正的爱畜乐园
guess who has a genuine petting zoo in the backyard?

181
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,990
* 夏日微风  让我舒爽 *
* Summer breeze makes me feel fine *

182
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,310
瞧瞧
All right!

183
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,100
好多动物
Animals!

184
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,200
卡梅隆  你还做了个长得像米奇的稻草人
Oh, Cam, and you had the scarecrow made to look like Mitch!

185
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,210
不不不  那稻草人是我妈从老家寄来的
No, no, no, my mom sent that out from Missouri.

186
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,050
他从小伴着我长大
I grew up with that.

187
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,630
我连跳舞都是跟他学的呢
I even learned how to dance with it.

188
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,590
但经你这么一说  我貌似是有个理想型  
I guess, now that you mention it, I do have a-a type.

189
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,840
-那只山羊头上是啥  -我的伟大创意
- Hey, what's on this goat's head? - That's my big idea --

190
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,460
摄相机记录下大伙的快乐时光
a camera to capture everyone's delight!

191
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,630
-猜猜我管这叫啥  -羊动专业摄影吗
- Guess what I call it. - Goat-Pro?

192
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,630
{\an8}音似此类运动专业摄影机GoPro

193
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,510
你取的这名字...  也不赖
That's also a...good name, yep.

194
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,400
看啊  乔  这是一只山羊
Look, Joe. This is a goat.

195
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,860
我好害怕
Ahh, I'm scared!

196
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,830
不不不  没什么好害怕的
No, no, no, there's nothing to be scared of.

197
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,080
它就是这么跟别人说"我爱你"
That's the way he says, "I love you."

198
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,900
这么多动物之中  这货的叫声
Of all the animals, this one is the one

199
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,700
跟告密者在被施以极刑时的惨叫最像
that sounds the most like an informer being tortured.

200
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,040
我不能再有一个怕动物的儿子
I cannot have another son that is afraid of animals.

201
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,310
曼尼五岁时  他去爱畜乐园玩
When Manny was 5, he went to a petting zoo

202
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,880
双肩包里装满了松露爆米花
with a backpack full of truffle popcorn.

203
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,200
在人们终于把那些猪从他身上拽下来时
By the time they pulled the pigs off him,

204
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,490
他全身上下只剩一只袜子了
he was only wearing one sock.

205
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:07,660
乔  放心
Joe, relax.

206
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,510
动物不会无故攻击人类的
Animals don't attack people for no reason.

207
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,470
放开我  快点放开
Let go of me! Oh, let go of me!

208
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,030
快逃  杰瑞  他们可会欺负人了
Run, Jerry! They do terrible things!

209
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,240
好消息
Good news.

210
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,360
我们提前寄出的洗发产品包裹
The box of hair products we pre-shipped has arrived

211
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,090
已经抵达度假村了
and is waiting for us at the resort.

212
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,640
我不在乎我们的头发了
I don't care about our hair anymore.

213
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,520
你这是在胡言乱语
Hey! That's crazy talk.

214
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,060
我还是没足够的勇气告诉我父母
I still haven't gotten up the guts to tell my parents.

215
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,830
我妈也许能接受  但我爸一定会抓狂
My mom will be cool, but my dad is gonna freak out.

216
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,110
那我去告诉他
Well, I'll tell him.

217
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,050
我和你爸是好哥们
Your dad and I are buds.

218
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,390
而且我特擅长跟人说坏消息的同时保持微笑
And I am excellent at delivering bad news with a smile.

219
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,930
这意味着海岸巡防队员
And that means the Coast Guard

220
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,030
能回家与家人一同度过假期
will be spending the holidays with their families,

221
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,710
因为此次搜索行动已被叫停
because the search has been called off.

222
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,050
你果然厉害
Wow, you're good.

223
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,780
菲尔  你好
Phil. Hey.

224
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,590
我知道最近我们一直聚少离多
I know we haven't been spending enough time together lately,

225
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,130
但我在卡波预约了超赞的度假别墅过周末
but I scored this amazing villa in Cabo for the weekend,

226
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,180
我想带个特殊的人一起去
and I wanted to take a special someone.

227
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,180
我在听
Listening.

228
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,650
我知道你有家庭橄榄球大赛
I know you have your big family football game,

229
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,570
但别墅紧临大海  可以在海滩上骑马
but it's right on the water. Horseback riding on the beach.

230
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,220
我已经看见我俩穿白衬衫策马奔腾了
I see us both in white shirts.

231
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,000
-菲尔  -克莱尔  我知道
- Phil. - Claire, I know.

232
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,680
听起来像是我一生中最美好的周末  我的朋友
It sounds like the best weekend of my life, mi amigo,

233
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,690
但我不能去  要享受家庭时光
but I can't. It's family time.

234
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,970
-他是想带海莉去  -没错
- He wants to take Haley. - Yeah.

235
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,260
你以为我在邀请你吗
Did you think I was asking you?

236
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,280
咋啦  作为好哥们不能逗逗你玩吗
What... brother can't yank a brother's chain?

237
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,380
小题大做想搞事啊
You trippin'?

238
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,790
哥们真逗
This guy!

239
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,130
我会给你发些照片的
I'll send you some pictures.

240
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,650
-好啊  -但在裸体沙滩拍的就不发了
- Okay. - But not from the nude beach. Ooh!

241
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,020
真好笑因为裸体的是我的宝贝女儿
Oh, that's funny 'cause it's my naked daughter!

242
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,200
而你把她从我身边夺走了
And you're taking her away!

243
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,550
不哭不哭
It's okay.

244
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,400
看见没  它们很喜欢被你抚摸
See? They like it when you pet them.

245
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,860
如果你凝视着它们的眼睛
And when you look into their eyes,

246
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,830
就会发现它们其实很聪明
you can see that they're very smart.

247
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,810
它们也有内心和灵魂
They have a very deep soul.

248
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,720
他叫什么名字
What's his name?

249
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,930
一只山羊还要什么名字  让你摸你就摸
Name? It's a goat. Just touch it.

250
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,000
我知道海莉去卡波让你很郁闷
I know it's a bummer, Haley going to Cabo.

251
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,700
她去不去还不一定呢
I wouldn't salt those margarita glasses just yet.

252
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,720
等我让她记起家里的感恩节周末多好玩
Once I remind her how much fun Thanksgiving weekend is here,

253
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,180
她就哪也不想去了
she's not going anywhere.

254
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,620
希望效果会好过你上次那个
Well, I hope it goes better than

255
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,550
"白雪溜冰团比科切拉音乐节更酷"的
your big presentation on why the Ice Capades

256
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,110
推销大作战
were cooler than Coachella.

257
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,500
宝贝
Hey, honey.

258
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,330
我听说你们计划着要去旅行
I heard you had some tentative travel plans.

259
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,640
其实我们刚刚在网上确认了航班
Actually, we just checked in for our flight online.

260
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,290
谢谢你在这件事上这么开明
Thanks for being so cool about this.

261
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,250
当然
Of course. Mmm.

262
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,840
有饮用水真好
Potable water.

263
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,740
咱美国人都对干净的水源习以为常了对吧
We take this stuff for granted stateside, don't we?

264
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,790
我们去的是五星级度假村
It's a five-star resort.

265
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,220
我很肯定水会很干净的
I'm sure we'll be fine.

266
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,760
闻闻那些小吃的香气
Smell those side dishes.

267
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,700
等到明天赛前野餐时
They're gonna be even better tomorrow

268
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,760
味道肯定更好
at the post-game picnic.

269
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,020
你知道有什么不像野餐一样放松吗
You know what's not a picnic?

270
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,430
在卧室里穿上拖鞋时
Putting on your bedroom slipper

271
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,860
发现脚上爬满了蝎子
and getting an ankle full of scorpion.

272
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,730
谢了  老爸  我愿意冒这个险
Thanks, Dad. I'll take my chances.

273
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,240
你上次去科切拉音乐节前也是这么说的
That's what you said about Coachella,

274
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,170
而你错过了克丽斯蒂·山口和小蟋蟀杰明尼
and you missed Kristi Yamaguchi doing a triple twist lift

275
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,420
{\an8}克丽斯蒂·山口为美国著名花样滑冰选手

276
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,420
做转体三周托举
with Jiminy Cricket.

277
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,210
-怎么了  -你血压那么高不能吃这个
- What? - You are not allowed to eat those with your blood pressure.

278
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,240
别担心  这些薯片的影响
Don't worry. These chips won't show up

279
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,720
几周后才能看出来  到时我已经换医生了
for a couple of weeks, and by then I'll have switched doctors.

280
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,740
不好意思  歌洛莉亚下令了
Sorry, Gloria's orders.

281
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,650
杰  看起来你需要跳跳方块舞放松一下
Hey, Jay, looks like you could use a little square dance.

282
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,260
那是我最不想做的...
That would be about the last...

283
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,330
{\an8}* 拉住你的舞伴  转个圈 *
* Ho, grab your partner, swing 'em 'round *

284
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,710
{\an8}* 换上最好的衣裳  进城逛 *
* Put on your best suit and go to town *

285
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,770
小卡  你为什么
Cam, why are you...

286
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,710
{\an8}* 吃点玉米  把马骑 *
* Eat some corn and ride a horse *

287
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,720
{\an8}* 问俺们爽不  当然爽 *
* Are we having fun? Why, yes, of course *

288
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,240
够了  我要走人了
That's it! I'm out of here!

289
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,840
我要去药房买点阿司匹林
I need some aspirin. I'm going to a pharmacy.

290
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,890
我也去  没什么理由
I'm coming too. No reason.

291
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,980
这年头抛下家人貌似是不需要理由的
Apparently, you don't need a reason to leave your family.

292
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,230
我也去  我的方便面和抗抑郁药不够了
I'll go too. I'm out of ramen and Xanax.

293
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,080
这是什么情况
What's happening?

294
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,750
我们天气预报圈里管这叫
This is what we in the weather game

295
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,770
"高压[力]系统"
refer to as a "High-pressure system."

296
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,270
此情此景让我想起
This reminds me of the time

297
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,010
我撞见你边看《壮志凌云》边"撸黄油棍"
I walked in on you watching "Top Gun".

298
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,790
你别再提起那件事了
You need to stop telling that story.

299
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,480
无论你对小卡做了什么
Whatever you did to Cam,

300
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,700
肯定没糟到那份上
it can't have been that bad.

301
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,880
也肯定不值得你这么牺牲
And it is not worth this.

302
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
也许你是对的  也许我过于担忧了
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm worrying too much.

303
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,300
没错
You are.

304
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,540
我把小卡的费兹波小丑服送人了
I gave Cam's Fizbo costume away.

305
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,310
我的天  这里即将发生灭门惨案
Oh, my God, he's gonna kill everyone in the house.

306
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,110
当时卡车已经到了  各种纸箱子混在一起
The truck was here, and there were so many boxes,

307
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,800
你也知道我一扔旧货就会兴奋得昏了头
and you know how excited I get about a deduction.

308
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,590
听我说
Listen to me.

309
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,690
他不会相信那只是意外的
He's not going to believe that this was an accident.

310
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,870
你永远永远不能告诉他
You can never, ever tell him.

311
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,170
他会发现衣服不见了的
He's gonna know it's missing.

312
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,040
屁大点活动他都要拿出来穿
I mean, he pulls it out for everything.

313
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,510
生日派对  早午餐  高温瑜珈
Birthday parties, brunches, hot yoga...

314
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,220
我得等到时机对了再说
I-I need to wait for the right moment.

315
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,610
时机永远也不会对的
There's not gonna be a right moment.

316
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,490
每当我抱着小猪崽  
Hey, ain't nothing in the world that can get me down

317
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,020
这世上再也没有什么能把我打倒了
when I'm holding a little piglet.

318
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,020
看看她
Look at her!

319
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,710
是时候了  亲爱的
It's time. Sweetie?

320
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,360
-不要  -不要什么
- Don't do it. - Don't do what?

321
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,540
我需要你坐下听
I need you to sit down for this.

322
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,330
坐在草包上
Take a bale.

323
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,420
想想孩子们
Think of the children.

324
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,150
莉莉  德怀特
Lily, Dwight.

325
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,640
我把菲茨宝送人了
I gave Fizbo away.

326
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,430
-什么  -我知道那套衣服对你意义深远
- What? - I know how much that costume meant to you,

327
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,380
我真的非常非常抱歉
and I am so, so sorry.

328
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,540
这需要好好消化
Well, it's a lot to process.

329
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,640
我理解人难免会犯错
I know. Accidents do happen.

330
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,350
而且我正抱着一只小猪崽
And I am holding a little piglet.

331
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,740
我原谅你了
I forgive you.

332
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,480
如果你们不介意的话  我要去油炸火鸡了
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turkey to deep fry.

333
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,620
给  抱着康纳
Here. Hold Connor.

334
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,290
-不...好吧
- No, I... Okay.

335
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,480
我嫁给了这个星球上
I married the sweetest,

336
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,970
最温柔最善解人意的男人
most understanding man on the planet.

337
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,310
或者他对你做了甚至更糟糕的事情
Or he did something even worse to you

338
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,230
只想让你有个好心情
and wants to get you in a good mood.

339
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,090
不会的
No.

340
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,050
肯定是
Yes!

341
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,330
你不用遮住你的脸
You don't have to cover your face.

342
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,490
我不在乎小卡教练说的传染性接吻病
I don't care what Coach Cam says about mono.

343
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,650
而且你的可爱我没抵抗力
You're way too pretty.

344
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,670
别这么说
Oh, no.

345
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,810
我有些受宠若惊
I mean, listen, I'm flattered,

346
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,690
但虽然你长这么  那么高
but even though you are so, so tall

347
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,890
你还在上高中  而我
you are in high school and I'm...

348
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,050
超美
Very beautiful.

349
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,030
好吧
Well...

350
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,810
我本来要说上大学  但还是谢谢你
I was going to say, "in college," but thanks.

351
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,240
别这样  天哪
Stop it, oh, my God!

352
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,390
爸爸要把我逼死了
Ugh! Dad is killing me.

353
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,170
他企图让我感到愧疚然后不去卡波
He's trying to guilt trip me out of going to Cabo.

354
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,830
他什么时候才能让我过自己的生活
When is he gonna let me live my own life?

355
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,340
也许等你不再住在他的地下室
Maybe when you stop living out of his basement

356
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,510
不再吃他的东西时
and eating all of his food.

357
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,760
你说得对  我就是受害者
You're right. I am a victim.

358
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,000
我该买这个迷你漱口水给海莉
I should get this tiny mouthwash for Haley.

359
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,670
这是抛弃家人去旅行装
It's the abandon-your-family travel size.

360
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,990
我的天
Oh, dear God.

361
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,680
我知道  炸玉米粒  这时候在买一送一
I know -- Corn Nuts, two-for-one sale.

362
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,050
我感觉上帝在对我竖中指
I feel like God's giving me the middle finger.

363
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,400
不  那是我妻子的离婚律师
No. That's my wife's divorce lawyer.

364
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,330
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

365
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,470
那个混蛋也是我前妻的律师
That bastard was my ex's lawyer.

366
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,000
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

367
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,460
我打赌他是来这买超小号避孕套
I bet he's here to buy some extra-small condoms,

368
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,600
需要找药剂师买的那种
the kind that they keep behind the counter.

369
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,020
少啰嗦
Shut up.

370
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,170
我一直做梦他快要渴死在沙漠里
I keep having this dream that he's dying of thirst

371
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,760
然后我开车撞飞他
in the desert, and I hit him with my car.

372
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,590
-我以为你已经走出来了  -我本来也以为
-I thought you were over it. -I thought I was.

373
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,420
趁我的手铐还没炸开  我们快走吧
Let's get out of here before my cuff explodes.

374
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,090
他已经毁了我的家庭
Yeah, he already ruined my family.

375
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,340
我不想他再毁了我的感恩节
I don't want him to ruin my Thanksgiving too.

376
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,660
不
No.

377
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,860
我们哪也不去
We're not going anywhere.

378
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,050
是时候有人站出来
It's time someone stood up

379
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,690
对抗那些堂而皇之闯进我们生活
to the weasels who sweep into our lives,

380
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,420
破坏我们家庭
break up our families,

381
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,360
带走我们挚爱去卡波的黄鼠狼了
and take our loved ones to Cabo.

382
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,780
我感觉你在把事扯到自己身上  但你说得对
I feel like you're making this about you, but you're right.

383
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,920
你知道我什么时候开始有高血压的吗
Do you know when my high blood pressure started?

384
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,020
从我遇到那个人开始
When I met that guy.

385
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,660
这时候是不是该有人说  "把他拿下"
Is this when someone's supposed to say, "Get him!"

386
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,400
-不  -你把他按住
- No. - You hold him down.

387
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,070
我来用这只矫形鞋打他
I'm gonna beat him with this orthopedic shoe.

388
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,400
-来吧  -我们别想出第一个主意就行动啊
- Come here! - Let's not lock into our -- our first idea.

389
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,720
我爱你  山羊先生
I love you, Mr. Goat!

390
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,700
你看  乔
Aw, you see, Joe?

391
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,610
听妈妈的话  现在你就有新朋友了
You listen to Mommy, and now you have a new best friend.

392
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,640
什么
What?

393
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,010
你冷  我去给你拿条毯子
You're cold? I'll go get you a blanket!

394
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,180
如果他是去给猪拿毯子
Well, if he was going to get the pig a blanket,

395
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,510
你们知道应该怎么称呼吗
you know what that would be called.

396
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,480
猪包毯吗
Pig in a blanket?

397
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,650
{\an8}一种以香肠为主菜的配菜佳肴  状似热狗面包

398
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,650
好吧  这哏我也算喂到你嘴边了
Okay, I teed that one up for you.

399
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,400
好了  该炸火鸡了
All right, it's time to fry this turkey.

400
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,480
你俩谁能来帮我把防溅护目镜放下来
Somebody please lower my splatter goggles, boys?

401
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,370
叫你呢
You heard him.

402
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,600
你去
You do it.

403
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,530
你又不是放眼镜主席  随便使唤人
You're not the president of goggle lowering.

404
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,240
如果有办投票我就能当
I would be if they took a vote.

405
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,470
小卡能做错什么呢
What could Cam have done?

406
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,780
也许是他出轨了
Maybe he's the one who's having an affair.

407
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,220
我在杂志上看过出轨征兆
I saw a list of clues in a magazine.

408
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,260
他最近有没有加健身房会员或者买性感内衣
Has he joined a gym or bought sexy new underwear recently?

409
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,800
很感谢看得起我们
I think it's sweet that you think

410
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,380
觉得我们还有余力出轨  但我们真的很累
we're capable of having an affair, but we're just so tired.

411
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,720
好了各位
All right now, boys,

412
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,250
一定要像这样轻轻地慢慢地放下去
the key is you drop it nice and gentle like.

413
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,630
接吻病
Mono!

414
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,630
脱缰之羊
Runaway goat!

415
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,630
你是想躲去畜棚吧
Aw, you wanted to run to the barn!

416
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,970
我来反转一下这个悲伤的故事
Let me put a positive spin on this.

417
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,940
谁喜欢吃羊肉
Who here likes goat?

418
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,510
你这个畜生
Hello, you son of a bitch.

419
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,680
希望那个除臭剂好用  因为你就是个臭家伙
Hope you like that deodorant, 'cause you stink!

420
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,600
退疣灵
Wart remover --

421
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,280
见效的话  你全身就要不见了
well, if that works, there'll be nothing left.

422
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,770
哎哟哟  诺伯特和普里契特
Well, well, well. Norbert and Pritchett.

423
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,070
杰  一直没机会向你道谢
Jay, I don't think I ever got a chance

424
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,440
多谢你让我赚进了第一辆法拉利
to thank you for buying me my first Ferrari.

425
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,770
祝你开下悬崖
I wish you drove it off a cliff.

426
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,780
我的豪宅就在悬崖上
Like the one my house is on,

427
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,950
也是用你的钱买的  太感谢了
which you also paid for, thank you?

428
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,710
我们不是要把他拿下的吗
This doesn't sound like we're getting him.

429
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,690
你们想要免费法律建议吗  伙计们
Look, you want some free legal advice, fellas?

430
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,040
送你们三个词  娘们  滚吧  废柴
Three words -- Ladies. Leave. Losers.

431
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,300
不  先生  我们有三个字送你
No, sir, we have three words for you.

432
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,330
你 有没 羞...
Have you no sh-- have you --

433
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,860
没有...  没羞没躁  四个字
have no -- have you no shame -- it can be four words.

434
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,890
这傻蛋是谁
Who's this chuckle-head?

435
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,080
你永远也不会认识的人
Someone who you're never gonna know,

436
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,550
因为我结婚以来大部分时间都很幸福
'cause I'm happily married most of the time.

437
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,490
大家都这么说
Aw, that's what they all say.

438
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,940
然后有一天你老婆醒了之后说  "我的天
Then one day your wife wakes up and says, "Oh, my God!

439
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,240
我嫁了个傻逼"
I married a moron!"

440
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,740
她给我打电话  我接起来说
She calls me, and I'm like,

441
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,470
"你好  傻蛋夫人..."
"Hello, Mrs. Chuckle--"

442
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,290
挺准的
Yeah, that's about right.

443
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,770
他可能是心脏病发了
He might have had a heart attack.

444
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,240
我们好像该做点什么吧
We probably ought to do something.

445
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,020
我之前有看到那边有香槟
Oh, I saw some champagne back there.

446
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,250
他倒这儿了
It's the guy on the ground!

447
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,020
拿着除颤器  我去报警
Oh! Take the defibrillator, I'll call 911.

448
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,510
两位帮帮我  我根本不会用这个
Guys, help me out. I don't know what I'm doing.

449
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,730
我看了好多《实习医生格蕾》
I watch a lot of "Grey's Anatomy,"

450
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,880
不过所有不浪漫的镜头我全快进了
but I fast-forward through the non-romantic scenes.

451
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,190
不不不  不能救他
No no no, we're not gonna save him!

452
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,850
杰瑞  别这样  杰瑞
Jerry, no, Jerry.

453
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,030
杰  把他拉开
Jay, get him off me!

454
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,050
看看他的购物篮  活得也不是舒适
Look at his basket. Wasn't much of a life.

455
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,510
天啊  我肯定会后悔的
Ah, hell, I'm gonna regret this.

456
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,690
我感觉好点了  普里契特  应该只是胀气
I'm feeling better, Pritchett. I think it was just gas.

457
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,050
以防万一
Better safe than sorry.

458
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,780
一部分错在我
Oh, I deserve some of the blame.

459
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,390
我把农场风情画弄得太有吸引力了
I made my farmscape too inviting.

460
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,980
好吧  简直一团糟
Okay. This is a mess.

461
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,180
我们要怎么办
What are we gonna do now?

462
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,130
艾丽克斯  需要牺牲多少条羊命
Alex, how many goats have to die

463
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,590
你才能停止对高中小鲜肉
until you get a handle on your insatiable appetite

464
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,790
无休止的渴望
for high-school boys?

465
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,370
其实  这是我的错
Actually, I-it's my fault.

466
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,330
德怀特  我们长得好看的人
Ooh, Dwight. We're good-looking guys.

467
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,820
不为自己有吸引力而道歉
We don't apologize for it.

468
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,600
我把毯子拿来了  山羊先生
I got you a blanket, Mr. Goat.

469
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,000
不不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

470
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,580
我们去烟囱旁边等圣诞老人
We're going to wait for Santa Claus by the chimney!

471
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,100
但今天是感恩节啊
But it's Thanksgiving.

472
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,520
山羊先生怎么办
What about Mr. Goat?

473
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,430
为什么我听不到他的声音了
How come I don't hear him anymore?

474
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:58,120
山羊先生没事啦
Ay, Mr. Goat is fine!

475
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,700
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

476
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,410
你说什么  山羊先生
What is it, Mr. Goat?

477
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,170
他说他想静静
He's saying that he needs some time alone.

478
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,880
看  这些是给圣诞老人的饼干
Look, there's some cookies for Santa.

479
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,650
给你  去烟囱边坐着等好吗
Here, why don't you go and sit by the chimney and wait.

480
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,480
圣诞老人
Santa!

481
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,830
我不应该插嘴你孩子的教育
Hey lookit, it's not my place to try to parent your kids.

482
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,690
-很好  -但是我们在农场上学到的就是
- Good. - But one thing we learn on the farm

483
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,380
死亡是生命的一部分
is that death is a part of life.

484
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,000
你敢告诉乔那只山羊出事了
If you tell Joe what happened to that goat,

485
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,440
死亡将会是你生命的一部分
death is gonna be part of your life.

486
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,390
其实孩子的承受能力比你想象中要大得多
You know what, kids can handle a lot more than you think.

487
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,870
而且从出生到死亡的每一步
And every step, from birth till the end,

488
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,380
都有它自身的魅力
has its own magical beauty.

489
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,950
是要把山羊塞进垃圾桶里
So, do we jam the goat in the garbage

490
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,590
还是扔到围栏外
or heave it over the fence?

491
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,900
好好教你的孩子吧
Teach your children well.

492
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,850
谢谢你刚刚救了我
Hey. Thanks for before.

493
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,890
推了我一把  免得被山羊撞上
You know, pushing me out of the way of the goat.

494
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,730
不用谢啦
Don't worry about it.

495
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,380
为了保护领导人而已
It's more about protecting the office.

496
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,590
我们都知道应该是你当主席的
Look, I think we both know you should have been president.

497
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,370
或许我一直找你麻烦是因为我嫉妒你
Maybe I've been hard on you 'cause I'm jealous.

498
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,100
好呀
Yeah, okay.

499
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,620
我在搬这死羊  你俩却在这里谈情说爱
You two keep making out while I carry the dead goat.

500
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,210
山羊先生
Mr. Goat?

501
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,430
电话账单上有什么可疑活动吗
Any suspicious activity on that phone bill?

502
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,810
小卡花了100刀打通灵热线
Well, Cam spent $100 on the psychic hotline...

503
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,350
但是赛季越来越紧张时  这也是正常的
...but that's normal during the run-up to award's season.

504
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,080
我刚看到南瓜酱快吃完了
I just saw we were running out of pumpkin dip,

505
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,900
我知道你最喜欢这个  就给你拿了点过来
and I know it's your favorite, so I brought you some.

506
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,620
你到底在玩什么把戏
What's your game?

507
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,470
-没错  亮出你内衣里的乾坤  -什么
- Yeah, show us your underwear. - What?

508
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,870
菲茨宝的事情你为什么这么淡定
Why are we so understanding about Fizbo, huh?

509
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,880
你在隐瞒什么
What are you hiding?

510
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,730
隐瞒
Hiding?

511
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,420
你太可耻了
Shame on you.

512
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,920
今天是感恩节
It's Thanksgiving.

513
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,600
我想跟我的丈夫
I want to celebrate with my husband,

514
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,260
我的女儿  我可爱的家人  杰瑞一起庆祝
my daughter, my lovely family, Jerry.

515
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,500
你们俩把生活看作是一场
I think it's sad that you two look at life

516
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,930
每个人都试着摆脱某些事责任的游戏
as some sort of game where everyone's trying

517
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,350
真是太可悲了
to get away with something.

518
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,720
有的人就是人很好而已
Some people are just nice.

519
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,500
他们信了
They bought it.

520
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,170
其实是我把我们之前
Truth is, I paid for the jamboree

521
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,130
为了去夏威夷度假省下的钱花在这场欢宴上
with money we had saved for a romantic Hawaiian vacation.

522
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,530
我甚至还从密苏里买了奢华草包寄过来
I even sprung for fancy straw bales flown in from Missouri.

523
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,980
这才叫档次
That's class.

524
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,660
这里出什么事了 
The hell happened here?

525
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,860
我这一天也是受够了
I think I felt enough for one day.

526
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,740
可能是我被电击太多的副作用
It's possible I've been electrocuted one too many times.

527
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,530
我今天学到了一些东西
You know, I learned something today.

528
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,710
我看到一个人在我面前差点死了
I saw a man nearly die right in front of me.

529
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,480
而这玩意时刻在提醒我
And this is a constant reminder

530
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,390
我也随时可能有同样遭遇
that it can happen to me at any moment.

531
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,900
很让人不禁思考
It's a lot to think about.

532
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,750
所以老子不戴了
So I'm not gonna.

533
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,840
菲尔  给我拿瓶啤酒
Phil, get me a beer.

534
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,970
杰瑞  给我来杯威士忌
Jerry, get me a scotch.

535
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,010
我今天也有点心得
I learned something today, too.

536
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,290
现在不是时候  杰瑞
It's a lot right now, Jerry.

537
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,340
出什么事了  儿子
What's the matter, kid?

538
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,390
我爱山羊先生
I loved Mr. Goat.

539
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,830
它死了
He died.

540
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,010
求你别抽了
Please don't smoke.

541
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,550
你完全不需要担心  乔
Hey, don't you worry about a thing, Joey.

542
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,680
我会一直在
I'm not going anywhere.

543
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,210
爸  不管你说什么  卡波我去定了
Dad, I don't care what you say. I'm going to Cabo.

544
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,040
行  去吧
You sure are.

545
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,990
对对对  我会被阿兹特克人绑架
Sure, I'm gonna get kidnapped by Aztecs

546
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,720
{\an8}已灭绝的墨西哥古文明  存在于14至16世纪

547
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,720
然后扔进火山里献祭  行了
and sacrificed in a volcano. I get it.

548
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,400
不  宝贝  我想要你去
No, honey, I want you to go.

549
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,670
抱歉我之前那样子
I-I'm sorry about earlier.

550
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,410
我很生气  但没有直接说
I was mad. And instead of talking about it,

551
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,290
死憋在心里  结果爆发反而更难看
I pushed it down and it came out in some ugly ways

552
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,320
伤到我美丽的女儿和那个长疣的律师
with my beautiful daughter and a lawyer who has warts.

553
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,910
总之  只是因为你的生活
Anyway, it's just more and more of your life

554
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,020
越来越与我无关  这很正常  也是好事
is happening away from me, and it's normal and good,

555
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
但我难以接受
but it's hard.

556
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,030
靠  你这么贴心干嘛
Damn it, why do you have to be so sweet?

557
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,100
现在我感觉内疚了
Now I feel guilty.

558
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,430
别内疚  去卡波好好玩
Don't. Go to Cabo. Have fun.

559
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,240
我可以今天玩橄榄球
You know, I could play football today.

560
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,840
来一次海利式超远长传战术
Run that Haley Mary?

561
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,280
那就太好了
That would be so wonderful...

562
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,930
-又被电了吗  -很严重
- Electrocuted again? - Real bad.

563
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,960
散开  上吧
Okay, break! Let's go!

564
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,430
好了  大家
All right, everybody.

565
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,470
欢迎来到第15届感恩节橄榄球年度比赛
Welcome to the 15th annual Thanksgiving football game,

566
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,030
这次提前一天举行
being played a day early.

567
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,910
我必须提一句
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

568
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:55,030
我们能齐聚一堂真是太棒了
how beautiful it is that we're all together.

569
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,110
是我的错觉吗  还是你们也能感受到爱...
Is it just me, or can you feel the love...

570
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,650
-能快点开始吗  -好吧
- Can we please do this? - All right.

571
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,510
准备进攻
Down!

572
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,220
就位
Set.

573
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,850
-菲尔  我们还好吧  -很好
- Phil, we're good, right? - Oh, we're great.

574
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,280
你真该带克莱尔去一次这个度假村
You should really take Claire to this resort.

575
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,580
超浪漫
Very romantic.

576
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,800
蓝色39号战术
Blue, 39!

577
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,790
每个房间都有心形浴缸
Heart-shaped jacuzzi in every room.

578
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,600
堪萨斯城  堪萨斯城
Kansas City, Kansas City...

579
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,380
其实  我现在才算很好
Actually, now I'm great.

580
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,820
天哪  老爸  要这样吗
Oh, my God, Dad. Seriously?

581
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,860
真是美好的一天
Ah, what a beautiful day.

582
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,640
我累坏了
Oh, I am exhausted.

583
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,100
我已经在为夏威夷之旅倒数了
I'm counting down the days till we're in Hawaii.

584
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,020
亲爱的  我估计你得数好久好久了
Sweetie, I don't know if you can count that high.

585
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,990
还记得我对菲茨宝这事多淡定吗
You remember how cool I was with the whole Fizbo thing?

586
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,970
小卡  你把夏威夷经费花这派对上了吧
Cam, you spent the Hawaii money on this party, didn't you?

587
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,650
我们这是怎么了
What is wrong with us?

588
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,710
从现在起  我们要互相坦诚  好吗
From now on, can we just be honest with each other, all right?

589
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,600
-不耍心计  -成交
- No more games. - Deal.

590
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,730
爸爸们  你们看着很累
Hey, daddies. You look tired.

591
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,590
我给你们做了烤芝士三明治
I made you some grilled cheese sandwiches.

592
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,910
爱你们
Love you.

593
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,150
-我们还是有做得好的地方  -是啊
- Well, there's something we did right. - Yeah.

594
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,440
