42
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,570
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

43
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,420
You need to take a break, clear your head.

44
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,750
You need a vacation.

45
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,450
I'm gonna quit my job.

46
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,170
I'm not looking forward to moving

47
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,020
to Hershey, Pennsylvania.

48
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,590
I don't want kids.

49
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,460
Ever.

50
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,450
I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.

51
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,530
Go ahead. Chop us in half.

52
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,310
When will they wake up?

53
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,320
They should've already.

54
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,640
We were worried about you, Jenny.

55
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,080
So glad you're back.

56
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,900
I am gonna give you three words.

57
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,030
Try to remember them.

58
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,000
Apple. Ball. House.

59
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,400
Can you count back from 100 by 7 for me?

60
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to Harvard, you know.

61
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,140
93, 86,

62
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,090
79, 72, 65.

63
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,670
And what city are we in?

64
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,970
San Jose.

65
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,990
And what were those three words?

66
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,850
Apple. Ball. House.

67
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,170
Look out, Harvard.

68
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,010
We'll be doing a lot more tests to know for sure,

69
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,530
but your heart does sound better.

70
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,500
How's Katie?

71
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,360
You woke up before her, so too soon to tell.

72
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,340
There's virtually no alpha or beta brain activity.

73
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,080
We must have missed something during the separation surgery.

74
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,790
We didn't.

75
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,920
Katie's BP was steady, sats were fine,

76
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,020
regional blood supplies were reconstructed.

77
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,080
Just like Jenny, yet she's awake,

78
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,190
Katie's in a coma.

79
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,980
Katie's got the new sagittal graft.

80
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,770
A problem with blood flow in that vein could cause her condition.

81
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,290
An MRI angiogram should tell us if the graft is open or not.

82
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,120
Hello.

83
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,370
I will proceed with the angiogram.

84
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,820
Murphy, you've been gone for two days.

85
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,150
How about we start there?

86
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,620
Okay.

87
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,580
Just because you talked to the president

88
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,670
doesn't qualify as permission.

89
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,480
Okay. Yes.

90
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,220
I...will notify Dr. Melendez

91
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,210
next time I go on a road trip with my girlfriend.

92
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,440
Amazing.

93
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,530
"Road trip"?

94
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,190
Dr. Glassman said you were dealing with a personal crisis.

95
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,840
That is true.

96
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,110
Do you know the definition of personal crisis?

97
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,140
Yes. A stage in a sequence of events

98
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,570
at which the trend of all future events is determined.

99
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,760
- A death, an illness. - Yes.

100
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,700
No, not a road trip.

101
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,760
Okay.

102
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,200
You and Dr. Browne get going on Katie's angiogram,

103
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,920
unless, of course, you have any personal emergencies to attend to.

104
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,530
No. My crisis is over.

105
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,110
Come in.

106
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,390
How are the twins doing?

107
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,850
Jenny's in recovery.

108
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,950
Her numbers look good. She's talking.

109
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,420
Katie -- not so good.

110
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,660
We need to talk about Murphy.

111
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,330
I told you he's on personal leave.

112
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,060
Yeah, well, that's not what he said.

113
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,730
You talked to him?

114
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,570
Yes.

115
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,320
In the surgical unit five minutes ago.

116
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,650
There's the sagittal vein graft we constructed for Katie.

117
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,000
It's open with good flow.

118
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,430
Graft is fine.

119
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,900
Which means we still have no explanation for her coma.

120
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,200
Go in closer.

121
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,400
The middle cerebral vein,

122
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,690
it has low flow out of the brain.

123
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,550
You're thinking low flow out means low flow in?

124
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,840
Yes, that is what I'm thinking.

125
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,860
We should look at the arterial inflow phase.

126
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,700
We'd like to look at the arterial inflow phase, please.

127
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,470
So, what'd you do on your trip?

128
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,290
Well, sometimes - when we take a road trip,

129
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,380
we're running away from something.

130
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,230
I kissed Lea.

131
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,310
And Dr. Glassman is mad at me.

132
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,920
What is he mad at you about?

133
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,310
It's almost entirely blocked.

134
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,670
And...there's a malformation in the Circle of Willis.

135
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,240
Katie is barely getting any blood to her brain.

136
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,660
Excuse me. Shaun?

137
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,390
May I speak with you, please?

138
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,190
Dr. Melendez -- He was not angry.

139
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,520
Oh, no, Shaun. Dr. Melendez is angry with you.

140
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,850
He's also angry with me.

141
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,300
W-why?

142
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,110
"Why"? Because I lied to him for you.

143
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,470
Why did you run away?

144
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,970
I didn't -- didn't run away.

145
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,200
When you leave without notifying your attending,

146
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,310
when you drop all of your responsibilities at this hospital...

147
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,660
When you leave without telling anyone, including me,

148
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,710
then you are running away.

149
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,010
Did this trip with this girl help?

150
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,340
Yes. Yes, it did.

151
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,330
Okay. How?

152
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,580
I would like to give two-weeks notice.

153
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,970
Mom, can you ask them to bring me some more ice chips?

154
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,130
I'll get them, sweetie.

155
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
I'll get a doctor.

156
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,170
No.

157
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm just...

158
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,070
When you left, there was no one here.

159
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,560
For the first time in my life, I was alone.

160
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,420
Sweetie.

161
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,530
It felt...cold.

162
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,140
Well, sometimes it is cold.

163
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,110
But you know what?

164
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,750
Someday, you might find that you like it.

165
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,980
Wrongful termination.

166
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,710
Dr. Kalu assaulted an attending surgeon.

167
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,760
I don't think you have strong legal footing here.

168
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,210
There's more to the story.

170
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,410
And I am sympathetic to Dr. Kalu,

171
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,040
but his ends don't justify his means.

172
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,290
Obviously we can't tolerate staff members --

173
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,340
And yet you do.

174
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,460
Please read on.

175
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,330
The middle cerebral has narrowed.

176
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,960
It's less than 2 millimeters.

177
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,040
We bypass the artery here and restore blood flow.

178
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,540
Open her back up?

179
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,600
She's just been through a massive operation.

180
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,480
The brain tissue hasn't settled.

181
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,740
Another could very well stroke Katie out.

182
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,280
Other options.

183
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,040
Intravascular.

184
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,030
I don't see how an intravascular ultrasound

185
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,130
gives us a better picture.

186
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,000
No, not imaging.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,440
He wants a stent in the middle cerebral artery

188
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,790
in the angio lab. I like it.

189
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,850
Stenting is usually reserved for the heart and the carotid.

190
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,320
It's not the usual, but we are way past the usual.

191
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,660
It would lower the danger of a stroke.

192
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,410
Dr. Murphy, would you like to assist?

193
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,090
Y-Yes.

194
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,050
Dr. Melendez, would you like to write me

195
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,590
a letter of recommendation?

196
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,780
You see the narrowing there, in the horizontal segment

197
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,070
- of the middle cerebral artery. - Middle cerebral artery.

198
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,810
Yeah. I've heard about you.

199
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,800
You're the one making the old guard nervous.

200
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,390
W-why would I make people nervous?

201
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,120
'Cause you have a gift.

202
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,650
And surgeons judge themselves against their peers,

203
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,410
and right now, you're winning.

204
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,840
We're in position.

205
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,300
Dr. Murphy, please inflate the balloon.

206
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,870
Give us another squirt of contrast.

207
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,060
And we should have good blood flow.

208
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,460
Yes, the proximal end of the artery is dissecting.

209
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,970
The balloon is damaging her artery.

210
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,260
Waveform is worsening.

211
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,470
Stent won't hold.

212
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,750
She's gonna stroke. I'm aborting.

213
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,480
Okay.

214
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,180
Waveform is normalizing.

215
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,030
We're right back where we started.

216
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,600
Katie's brain is starving.

217
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,170
I want to see Katie.

218
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,580
I know she's in a coma. I still need to see her.

219
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,680
I miss her.

220
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,420
We can't risk contamination for either of you.

221
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,010
She needs to know I'm there.

222
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:43,880
We understand.

223
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,910
You can't understand.

224
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,090
No one can.

225
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,550
We have always been there for each other,

226
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,930
and now when she needs me most, I'm not there.

227
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,710
You've just been through a 40-hour surgery.

228
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,080
We need you to focus on your own healing.

229
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,780
And what about her heart?

230
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,130
We're going to do - a cardiac catheterization test

231
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,250
to see if her heart circulation has improved.

232
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,930
Inject the contrast to evaluate the heart's blood supply.

233
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,800
How's my soul looking?

234
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,870
That's a different specialty.

235
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,940
Katie says the eyes - are the window to the soul.

236
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,170
I say the eyes lie. It's the heart.

237
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:24,630
Well, then, so far your soul is looking good.

238
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,700
Strong, unobstructed blood flow.

239
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,420
Ventriculogram will tell us how the muscle function's doing.

240
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,300
So quiet. Is everything okay?

241
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,430
Ventricle's strained and dilated.

242
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,590
We were hoping for some improvement post-separation,

243
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,230
but it's barely pumping.

244
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,960
It just doesn't make any sense.

245
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,110
The separation was supposed

246
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,690
to relieve the stress on Jenny's heart.

247
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,490
Half the need, half the work.

248
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,720
Jenny's heart was even sicker than it appeared.

249
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,770
Seems we couldn't see that

250
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,950
because Katie's heart was doing all the work for Jenny's.

251
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,260
What can we do to fix it?

252
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,770
Give her a new heart.

253
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,370
We're not gonna find a donor match in time.

254
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,630
Yes, we already have the perfect heart for Jenny.

255
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,400
The sisters are monozygotic and therefore a genetic match.

256
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,770
On the other hand, Katie is alive.

257
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,180
- She is GCS-3. - Her heart is still beating.

258
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,920
Yes, but she is unresponsive.

259
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,740
And I don't see a way to return blood flow to the brain.

260
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,650
In all likelihood, Katie's not coming back.

261
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,250
Yes, Katie very well may die,

262
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,660
but we can't predict when that'll be.

263
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,970
It could be today. It could be 20 years from now.

264
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,430
If Katie stays on the ventilator.

265
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,480
- That's not up to us. - I know.

266
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,770
But I also know that, based on these scans,

267
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,550
Jenny might not make it through the night.

268
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:46,170
We need to propose this to the mother.

269
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,080
There's no chance Katie will wake up?

270
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,630
We can't say with 100% certainty,

271
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,870
but from what we saw on Katie's brain scan...

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,360
we have little reason for hope.

273
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,430
But what we can say with certainty

274
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,530
is that without Katie's heart, Jenny will die.

275
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,840
Can we wait?

276
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,320
Just a little. Maybe you'll know more.

277
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,930
Maybe something will change.

278
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,400
If we don't do anything,

279
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,420
Jenny's heart will stop before the morning.

280
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,390
How do you...

281
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,070
Would it be painful?

282
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,780
No. We simply power down Katie's ventilator.

283
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,980
Once off life support, she will peacefully pass.

284
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,950
Do you want us to explain this to Jenny?

285
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,790
I'm sure she'll want to be present.

286
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,680
No.

287
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,240
I put trust in them from an early age,

288
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,630
thinking responsibility would build strength.

289
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,420
I think it worked.

290
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,660
But this...

291
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,290
No.

292
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,100
Jenny can't be part of this in any way.

293
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,530
It'd destroy her.

294
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,760
I'll tell her Katie died.

295
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,900
"Dr. Shaun Murphy

296
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,600
exhibits technical skills beyond his years."

297
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,480
You wrote that?

298
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,350
Yes.

299
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,170
That's why I signed my name at the bottom.

300
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,910
You think Shaun survives at another hospital?

301
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,460
I didn't think he'd survive here.

302
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,200
Without your endorsement, Shaun isn't going anywhere.

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,670
I may have my issues with him,

304
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,210
but no matter how stupid an idea this may be,

305
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,470
I'm not gonna stop him from going after what he wants.

306
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,650
There's another signature line next to mine.

307
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,910
It's where the president of the hospital has to sign.

308
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,790
The chief oncologist.

309
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,600
This is before I came here in December of '14.

310
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,220
Dr. Marshall shoved a scrub nurse

311
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,610
during a post-op discussion of some sort.

312
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,630
Do you remember that?

313
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,560
I do.

314
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,480
Your response - was to settle with the nurse

315
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,670
while Dr. Marshall - was let off with a warning.

316
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,620
There's another almost identical instance earlier in that year.

317
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,650
In both cases, the doctors in question were white.

318
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,460
They were censured. Dr. Kalu was fired.

319
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,300
You think - this was a racial matter?

320
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,610
Do you think I'm racist?

321
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,290
That I favor white people?

322
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,460
Then why the leniency then and not now?

323
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,340
They're stars...

324
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,320
that happened to be white.

325
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,720
Doctors like Marshall allow St. Bonaventure

326
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,580
to compete with other West Coast institutions.

327
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,100
So, that's our defense?

328
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,010
"We're not racist.

329
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,270
We just allow our doctors to assault people

330
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,020
as long as they bring in enough donors."

331
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,650
They were reprimanded.

332
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,680
And there were no further incidents.

333
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,570
And how do you think all of this is gonna play out in court?

334
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:34,860
Settle.

335
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,620
Okay.

336
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,360
Floor?

337
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,540
Four.

338
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,290
Shaun asked Dr. Melendez for a letter of recommendation.

339
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,910
Yeah.

340
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,630
All I have to do is sign it and off he goes.

341
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,270
I think...

342
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,890
he might think that you're mad at him.

343
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,740
If you don't sign, it reinforces what he thinks.

344
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,180
But if you do,

345
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,960
it lets him know that you believe in him.

346
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,220
Can I touch her?

347
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,520
Of course.

348
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,650
Goodbye, baby.

349
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,980
- Are you ready? - Yes.

350
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,960
She's stabilizing.

351
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,040
I don't understand.

352
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,770
What's going on?

353
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,470
Katie's not ready to go.

354
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,040
She's breathing on our own,

355
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,860
which means Katie has normal brain stem function, correct?

356
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,590
When a ventilator is removed, life can continue.

357
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,030
It's rare, but it can happen.

358
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,170
It doesn't change the prognosis for awakening.

359
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,060
Off the ventilator with normal vitals

360
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,810
suggests long-term vegetative state, right?

361
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,850
Yeah.

362
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,930
We just lost our remedy for Jenny's heart.

363
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,450
What about ECMO?

364
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,990
Use the machine as a replacement for Jenny's heart.

365
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,900
Buys us... two weeks of life?

366
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,050
I don't like it.

367
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,750
ECMO requires blood thinners.

368
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,280
She just had brain surgery.

369
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
It could cause a catastrophic bleed.

370
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,360
Well, ECMO and its complications

371
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,740
may be our only avenue.

372
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,110
R-Re-conjoin them.

373
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,420
You want -- You want to put their heads back together?

374
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,760
Not the heads.

375
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,480
The thighs, the femoral vessels.

376
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,640
Is it a funny idea?

377
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,780
I think it's funny - that I didn't think of it.

378
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,360
The girls' blood is identical.

379
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,870
No need for anti-clotting meds, so no possibility of a bleed.

380
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,980
As long as they're attached,

381
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,520
Katie's heart will beat for Jenny.

382
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,690
When Katie dies,

383
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,240
we sever the femoral connection

384
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,640
and transplant Katie's heart into Jenny.

385
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,690
We just spent 40 hours separating them,

386
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,650
and now we want - to put them back together.

387
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,300
You tried to kill Katie?

388
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,210
No.

389
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,650
You took her off life support.

390
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,860
What do you call that?

391
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,560
Mercy. Not just for her.

392
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,220
You need a heart or you're going to die.

393
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,850
Katie's alive.

394
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,150
She was then, and she's even more now.

395
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,390
Katie's alive in the sense that she has basic organ function,

396
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,060
but she has no higher-cognitive brain activity.

397
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,500
She's surviving,

398
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,030
but she is not living.

399
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,320
Hours ago,

400
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,180
you thought she'd die

401
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,730
as soon as you pulled the plug.

402
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,660
You were wrong.

403
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,870
How do I know you're not wrong this time, too?

404
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,000
The demand on -- on Katie's heart

405
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,780
is minimal in her resting state.

406
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,770
She can easily tolerate helping you.

407
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,820
I won't ask Katie to be my life-support machine.

408
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,510
Dr. Andrews.

409
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,880
Let's put the sisters in the same room overnight.

410
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,230
I don't think that Jenny sees herself as an individual yet.

411
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,250
You know, I'm thinking the only thing that'll change Jenny's mind

412
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,930
about the reattachment is Katie.

413
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,140
Being close might help Jenny to

414
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,370
see her as lifeless.

415
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,190
Could backfire...

416
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,220
and cement her feelings that she's killing her sister.

417
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,610
Yeah, possibly.

418
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,400
And then we're in the same position anyways.

419
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,460
Okay, do it.

420
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,950
Well, what about baseballs

421
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,740
that this girl caught at a Giants game

422
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,390
signed by Mr. Hunter Pence?

423
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,680
He didn't hit it, but that doesn't matter.

424
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,550
- So, where is the sporting-goods one? - There.

425
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,380
Oh, no, that does not go in sporting goods.

426
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,390
It doesn't?

427
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,610
I'm applying to move my residency to

428
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,300
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

429
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,780
Really?

430
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,660
Yes. Penn State Medical Center.

431
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,120
Are you following me?

432
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,130
I need to make sure

433
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,450
you're not just doing this to stay close to me.

434
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,240
No.

435
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,170
Shaun.

436
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,620
I want my own life.

437
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,670
I want a life that I control,

438
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,060
not Dr. Glassman.

439
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,930
Dr. Glassman is just trying to help you.

440
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,520
I don't want help.

441
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,940
But what if... you need help?

442
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,630
How will I know if I stay?

443
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,150
Too much stuff. You have too much stuff.

444
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,840
We should book a trip.

445
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:00,300
Maybe somewhere warm.

446
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,890
You are so slow.

447
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,070
You're only folding underwear. Underwear's easy.

448
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,850
Okay.

449
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,200
No, Neil, I don't want to...

450
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,700
Fine.

451
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,110
Let's go, Preston.

452
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm ready.

453
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,480
Go.

454
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,220
You're the only good thing about my day.

455
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,330
I couldn't sleep last night.

456
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,200
I couldn't even close my eyes until...

457
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,930
I could feel Katie's heart beat in my hand.

458
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,800
If I do this,

459
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,420
at some point Katie's heart will beat for me, right?

460
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,080
That's the plan.

461
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,630
Then wherever I go, she will always be with me.

462
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,020
Okay. I'll do it.

463
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,800
How you doing, Jenny?

464
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,190
I can't feel anything.

465
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,470
That would be the magic of local anesthetic.

466
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,010
Vessels are clamped. Okay, Doctor.

467
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,580
We're ready to proceed with the anastomotic grafts.

468
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,820
It's done, isn't it?

469
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,430
I can tell.

470
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,650
Let's put both the girls' vitals next to each other, please.

471
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,360
Come on now.

472
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,820
Give it a few cardiac cycles to adjust.

473
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,490
How'd we do?

474
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,510
You did great.

475
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,470
Why Hershey?

476
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,880
Lea is moving there.

477
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,380
Well, they-- they make good candy bars.

478
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,670
I don't like candy bars.

479
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,530
I love pancakes.

480
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,570
Well, they make those, too.

481
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,960
I brought you here because...

482
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,690
I thought this place would provide a challenge for your abilities.

483
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,000
But I realized I really brought you here

484
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,240
because I thought you needed me.

485
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,240
This is a now signed letter of recommendation.

486
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,850
But...

487
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,670
I don't want you to go.

488
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,310
If you stay, I'll-- I'll back off. I'll...

489
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,880
I'll let you make your own choices, your own mistakes.

490
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,910
I believe in you, Shaun.

491
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,910
Their blood pressure dropped.

492
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,720
5 millimeters of Mercury.

493
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,190
I like when you say "Their."

494
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,930
You're gonna see some fluctuation.

495
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,210
BP drops 5 millimeters every complete cardiac circulation.

496
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,140
Shouldn't the fluctuation be inconsistent?

497
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,610
Maybe Katie's heart isn't picking up

498
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,520
the workload for Jenny as expected.

499
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,850
Jenny.

500
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,430
Jenny.

501
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,590
I'm-- I'm right h-here, Katie.

502
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,920
Right next to you.

503
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:46,000
{\an7}BGM: Break Apart (feat. Rhye) by Bonobo

{\an9}♪ It's hard to take all of this hate ♪

505
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:57,080
{\an9}♪ It's hard to take all of this ♪

506
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,200
Take Murphy and get a shotgun work-up on Katie.

507
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,790
I want everything -- EKG, EEG, and labs,

508
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,430
and an echo on Jenny.

509
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,830
{\an9}♪ This hate ♪

510
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,000
Katie has an awake alpha rhythm on her EEG.

511
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,120
She's doing remarkably well.

512
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,380
We're still not entirely sure

513
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,350
what caused Katie to regain consciousness.

514
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,560
Attaching them again could

515
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,800
have redistributed fluid into Jenny's system,

516
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,190
possibly decreasing the swelling in Katie's brain.

517
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,480
Just don't know.

518
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,820
I know.

519
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,600
They need each other. They always have.

520
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,040
The issue right now has become Jenny and her heart.

521
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,410
When Katie was in a coma,

522
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,240
the metabolic demand on her heart was very low,

523
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,700
but now that she's alert and active,

524
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,850
there just isn't enough heart for both of them.

525
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,130
What does that mean?

526
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,320
We're awaiting test results.

527
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,950
We're not sure how long Katie's heart

528
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,540
can tolerate the strain of supporting Jenny's circulation.

529
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,840
We'll closely monitor them with

530
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,730
cardiac labs and echoes.

531
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,560
We need to find a donor heart for Jenny as soon as possible.

532
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,200
No.

533
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,150
"No"?

534
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,410
I've had CEOs settle for half of what I just got for you.

535
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,880
I don't care about the money.

536
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,820
That's beautiful. It's admirable, even.

537
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,290
But, you see, this is how it works

538
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,270
because we live in a civilized society --

539
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,360
they hurt you,

540
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,760
we hurt them by making them cut you a massive check.

541
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,040
I don't want them to hurt.

542
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,530
I want them to give me my job back.

543
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,740
A third of "Your job back" Is,

544
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,630
by my calculation, uh, almost nothing.

545
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,590
I'll pay you - a third of this settlement.

546
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,050
What are you talking about?

547
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,620
You'll be paying me more than you earn in a year.

548
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,030
I want my job back.

549
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,370
Lunch is on you.

550
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,400
Lunch is on me.

551
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,650
Are you moving to Pennsylvania to be with Lea?

552
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,010
Does she know that?

553
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,450
Lea knows I'm moving to Hershey.

554
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,710
Yeah, but does she know you're going there

555
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,450
because she is going there?

556
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,550
I'm not.

557
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,060
Lea makes me happy.

558
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,410
Well, Lea's not the only one that can do that.

559
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:47,140
I'm gonna miss you.

560
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,560
Your BNP.

561
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,050
Jenny Kunkler's - cardio protein levels are...

562
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,950
I've never seen anything like it.

563
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,540
That's because the levels are for two hearts, not one.

564
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,570
Now Jenny is killing Katie!

565
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:11,300
- What's going on? - We got to separate them now

566
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,050
- or we're gonna lose them both. - We got the twins on the way?

567
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,080
In transit.

568
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,340
J.L.'s gonna do a local on the fly.

569
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,920
On my count. Three, two, one.

570
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,840
We can't do this. You'll die.

571
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,570
We're gonna do it.

572
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,340
No.

573
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,570
We're in this together.

574
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,870
The way we've always been.

575
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,530
The way we were meant to be.

576
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,400
It's Jenny! She's in v-fib!

577
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,910
Push a milligram epinephrine now!

578
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,100
Prepping Ambu bag.

579
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,210
Murphy, start chest compressions!

580
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,830
It's Jenny.

581
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,310
Her heart had nothing left to give.

582
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,640
Katie?

583
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,220
She's stable.

584
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,650
Her vitals are good,

585
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,760
but we have an issue that we need your help with.

586
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,110
Okay.

587
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,420
Katie won't allow us to separate her from Jenny.

588
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:55,750
If she doesn't acquiesce, Katie will clot and die.

589
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:00,500
Bring 10,000 units on board.

590
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,070
We'll clear out - and give you some privacy.

591
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,810
Baby.

592
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,340
We have to let her go.

593
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,900
I won't let them separate us.

594
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,980
I never wanted to do this.

595
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,180
You used to say we were made this way for a reason.

596
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,210
I won't let them do this.

597
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,760
Even if it kills me.

598
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,970
I want you to look at your sister.

599
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,950
Look at her.

600
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,890
I can't lose both of my daughters.

601
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,820
Dr. Andrews. Evening.

602
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,060
I, uh, checked out the twins' file.

603
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,460
It's an amazing case.

604
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,410
To be clear, Jared,

605
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,450
I don't want you here.

606
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,150
What we presented - to Miss Preston was the truth.

607
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,540
I understand that.

608
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,950
And those problem doctors and the ways we police ourselves will be dealt with,

609
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,470
should have been dealt with a long time ago,

610
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,740
but you stepped over a line.

611
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,810
I fought for my job.

612
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,180
You compromised your integrity.

613
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,830
The incident with that jerk coyle had nothing to do

614
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,580
with black or white,

615
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,810
but that's what you and your lawyer sold for leverage.

616
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:11,420
And when you misrepresent racism for something it's not...

617
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,000
...it sets us two steps back.

618
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,120
She's ready.

619
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:34,380
Jared, you're on suction.

620
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,160
Mayos.

Why?

645
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,500
Because I love you.

646
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
Odd reason to break up with somebody.

647
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,890
I want you to have everything in your life.

648
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,280
Which includes kids.

649
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,630
I told you - I was willing to not have kids.

650
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,700
You're gonna regret that decision one day.

651
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,100
- I won't. - Yes, you will.

652
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,270
You're just too decent to think it, but you will.

653
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,220
So what?

654
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,160
We all have regrets.

655
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,630
I-I wanted to play third base for the Astros.

656
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,720
It's not the same. That is a child's dream.

657
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,940
This is your life!

658
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,600
This is my life,

659
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,450
and it'd be more devastating to be resented by you

660
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,470
than to have my heart broken.

661
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:58,110
And you are going to be a great dad.

662
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,260
Shaun.

663
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,490
I wanted to give you something.

664
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,460
I'm letting you borrow it.

665
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,100
Bring it when you come visit?

666
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,440
Okay.

667
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,530
Promise?

668
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,720
You're gonna come visit, right?

669
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,270
I promise. I like Hershey.

670
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,510
- You've never been to Hershey. - Lea's there.

671
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,750
Can I put my arms around you?

672
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,220
Are you a good doctor?

673
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,000

00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,990
