00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,170
We're out of syrup.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,480
Huh. You know what?

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,850
Maybe I'll use my intern.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,270
- Glootie?
- Good?

5
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,090
- Thanks, Glootie.
- Anything else?

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,420
Do you want to develop an app?

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,230
- No thanks, Glootie.
- Hey, what's up, Glootie?

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,750
Hi, Morty. Do you want
to develop an app?

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,130
- No thanks.
- Rick, why does it say,

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,309
"Do not develop my app,"
on your intern's forehead?

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,630
Why, you want to develop one?

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,870
Ah, I'm glad you asked that, Jerry.

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,599
It's so you don't develop his app.

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,800
Glootie, go make some photocopies

15
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,810
- of something.
- Cool.

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,149
Well, if anyone wants to develop
an app with me, I'm down.

17
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,080
He seems to really want
to develop an app.

18
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,090
He really does, sweetie,
but nobody's gonna do that.

19
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,580
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,810
I've got a quick solo
adventure to go on,

21
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,870
and this one will not be directed

22
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,490
- by Ron Howard.
- He's gonna go poop.

23
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,810
When Grandpa Rick
pats his belly like that

24
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,450
and leaves without Morty, it
means he's going to go poop.

25
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,930
He's a shy pooper. He has
a secret pooping place.

26
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,390
Man, [BLEEP] you, Summer.

27
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,310
Honey, why can't you get
this excited about your SATs?

28
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,060
Well, I'm man enough to simply
say, "I'm going to poop,"

29
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,010
and I'd be honored to have

30
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,880
- Ron Howard involved.
- Good job, hon.

31
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,490
- Way to go, Dad.
- We're rooting for ya.

32
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,150
He's really putting you to work, huh?

33
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,419
Did you want to develop an app?

34
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,790
- I'll pass, Glootie.
- Hmm, your loss.

35
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,419
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

36
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,950
Eh, it's an app you'd want to develop.

37
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,390
- Can I ask what it is?
- Of course you can.

38
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,030
That's always the first
step in app development.

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,990
Ah.

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,940
50/50! Final offer!

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,110
Reverse digestion extrapolation.

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,829
Time to meet your maker.

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,819
What are you guys doing?

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,289
Did you develop an app?

47
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,350
Rule number one in app
development, son...

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,450
never follow the rules.

49
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,690
Except when the rule is tattooed
on an alien's forehead, Dad.

50
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,459
Why do you think Rick
would have that rule?

51
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,150
'Cause he's a disrupt-o-phobe.

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,180
No, Dad, no.

53
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,009
To keep something
horrible from happening,

54
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,830
something he's too lazy to explain.

55
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,640
Guys, we're getting our first users.

56
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,310
Whoa, this new app just matched me

57
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,790
with a guy that is su my ty.

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,030
Super my type. Learn to abbre.

59
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,090
Hey!

60
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,020
Your su ty works at Jersey Mike's

61
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,030
and sees 25 Phish shows a year.

62
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,580
- That is so Danny.
- Summer!

63
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,850
- Danny?
- Summer Smith?

64
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,400
Danny Publits from Lovefinderrz

65
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,530
with two "R's" and a "Z"?

66
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,199
I ran all the way here while
staring at your profile.

67
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,930
I tripped on a fire
hydrant and fell down,

68
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,910
so I'm covered in gravel
that stuck to my sweat.

69
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,060
And even after a shower,

70
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,499
I'll still be into a jam
band for old junkies,

71
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,630
but I think this world
cares too much about bands

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,879
and too little about love.

73
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,340
- And I think I love you.
- Me, too.

74
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,850
Hi, I'm my underage daughter's mother.

75
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,349
Nice to... whoa!

76
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,610
Come on. Just met.

77
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,070
Uh, this isn't working.

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,610
Wait. What are you...

79
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,990
Never mind.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,850
I quit, I'm gay, and I love Xander.

81
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,320
Stupid phones are destroying us.

82
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,430
Hey, sweetie.

83
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,590
Honey, our daughter ran
off with a Frisbee golfer

84
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,490
because of some app with a really dumb,

85
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,790
really forgettable name.

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,480
Like a really dumb, uncreative,
super sweaty name.

87
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,010
- _
- Anyway, I'll be late. I love you.

88
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,320
Got it. I love you, too.

89
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,740
Okay, Glootie, take the app down.

90
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,379
Can't take it down. I'm just an intern.

91
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,170
Uh, that's not how apps work.

92
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,910
Then make it how it works.

93
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,870
This isn't how making things work works.

94
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,099
Get... get it off the server.

95
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,950
Y-You think we're stupid, but we're not.

96
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,889
We know apps have something
to do with servers.

97
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,189
The server's on the mother ship.

98
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,290
Where's the mother ship?

99
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,910
- It's coming.
- Take us to it.

100
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,770
- No.
- Yes. Shake him more, Morty.

101
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,009
- That was working.
- Take us to the mother ship.

102
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,499
Okay, don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,379
An ominous beeping app.

104
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,559
You can't stay made at a
guy with this kind of talent.

105
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,470
Dad, you can, and you have to.

106
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,679
_

107
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,560
- Ribbit, ribbit.
- Ribbit, ribbit.

108
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,010
- Hey, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!
- Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!

109
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,430
Look at this guy. He
wants to eat me so bad.

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,670
You want to eat me, don't you?

111
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,690
- Ribbit.
- Just kidding. Have some drugs.

112
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,850
- Are you Vermigurber?
- What does this guy want?

113
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,790
- Who is this monkey?
- I'm here about a sandwich.

114
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,399
Oh, well you came to the right place...

115
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,279
... 'cause you're about
to get a bullet sandwich

116
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,090
on two slices of whole... gun.

117
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,829
You might want to get that.

118
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,589
Hello?

119
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,780
Dad, give the human whatever he wants.

120
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,610
He knows where I live. He's crazy!

121
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,230
You [BLEEP] idiot.

122
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,419
I have 800,000 kids.

123
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,799
Don't forget your voicemail.

124
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,850
You have 470,000 messages.

125
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,510
Oh, ah, that's half of them.

126
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,070
Okay, w-w-what do you
want? What do you want?

127
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,390
Wait, this is seriously
about sandwiches?

128
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,710
I thought this was about drugs or guns

129
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,930
or the fact that I'm a fly
that runs a frog restaurant.

130
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,330
There's a million things that
are interesting about me,

131
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,629
and none of them are sandwiches.

132
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,130
- Who ordered it?
- Talk to our delivery drone.

133
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,660
He... he run off to fight
in the robot wars.

134
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,230
Hey, ape man, I hope this was worth

135
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,149
making a whole swarm of enemies.

136
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,489
It will be when I find
whoever shit in my toilet.

137
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,740
Is that code for something?
Someone look that up.

138
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,350
If that's drug slang, I need to know it.

139
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,790
Ah!

140
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,890
- Mom, you can't stop true love.
- Oh, yes, I can.

141
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,530
- You're assaulting me!
- Keep your voice down.

142
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,990
- I'm being assaulted!
- Oh, yeah? Okay.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,430
- Statutory rape!
- Whoa.

144
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,580
My daughter's about to be raped!

145
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,859
No, I'm not! I'm being assaulted!

146
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,150
- Rape!
- Assault!

147
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,430
- Rape!
- Nobody cares. It's a motel.

148
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,290
Nobody's here because
their life's going so great

149
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,030
they can afford to get
mixed up in yours.

150
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,439
Deal with this [BLEEP] on your own.

151
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,110
You can't stop us from
getting a motel room.

152
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,250
Fine. I'll get one, too.

153
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,490
I'm getting the one next door,

154
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,210
and I'm putting a glass to
the wall, and I'm listening.

155
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,250
- Fine. Enjoy.
- I will.

156
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,080
- I'm Danny, by the way.
- You had your chance, dick.

157
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,340
- Take your app down.
- T-Take... take it down.

158
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,620
- What?
- I'm their hostage.

159
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,640
- Do they have weapons?
- Nope, but neither do I.

160
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,300
Do... do you have a weapon?

161
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,820
No.

162
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,340
- Take the app down.
- Take the app down.

163
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,660
I can't. I'm an intern.

164
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,679
Okay, well who tells interns what to do?

165
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,000
Not you, that's for sure.

166
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,720
Take us to whoever does,

167
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,920
or w-w-we'll... we'll punch you.

168
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,440
Okay.

169
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,950
Not bad, Morty.

170
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,780
Yeah, I don't know when the
other shoe's gonna drop,

171
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,349
but this is working pretty good so far.

172
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,510
Greetings.

173
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,360
We are the Monogatrons.

174
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,740
While your species was
still toying with fire,

175
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,360
ours mastered the
science of functioning,

176
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,180
committed relationships.

177
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,080
As the latest planet to develop our app,

178
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,690
you will now witness the true
power of superior intimacy.

179
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,980
Take the app down.

180
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,789
Take it down, or... we'll...
we'll... we'll punch you.

181
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,080
Is there someone with a gun or...

182
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:35,420
It's on its way.

183
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,510
The app remains up.

184
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,143
So what's the evil plan?

185
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,120
Does there have to be an evil plan?

186
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,540
- Oh, uh, uh...
- Uh, someone wanted a gun?

187
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,900
I'll take it. Thanks.

188
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,379
Here's the evil plan.

189
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,599
- [BLEEP]
- Goddamn it.

190
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,480
As a preapp civilization,

191
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,390
your love's value is
defined by scarcity.

192
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,330
You are highly trained to seek it,

193
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,140
and you have no idea how to maintain it.

194
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,549
Had you bothered to master love,

195
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,069
you would've learned by now,
it is as abundant as water.

196
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,319
You know what isn't? Water.

197
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,400
That [BLEEP] runs out.

198
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,580
So we'll be taking yours.

199
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,620
While your planet continues
to dick around with a, uh...

200
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,580
what is their version of it called?

201
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,759
Lovefinderrz, with two "R's" and a "Z."

202
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,730
- Oof.
- Yeah, not my idea.

203
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
- Goddamn.
- Am I interrupting?

204
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,460
- Impossible. Here she is.
- Mwah.

205
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,000
Your prisoners are getting away.

206
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,780
Prisoners are just things.

207
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,080
Connect with me. Tell me about your day.

208
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,600
I had an incredible meeting.

209
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,809
Did you know humans are 80% water?

210
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,479
And I found a new podcast
we can listen to tonight.

211
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,920
Love it. Okay, back to work.

212
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,649
Find and kill those earthlings.

213
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,420
We're outnumbered. There's no hope.

214
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,690
Then we go out in glory.

215
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,580
Flesh intruder, prepare to die.

216
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,490
Oh, hold on.

217
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,669
My apologies, Lieutenant Commander.

218
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,800
No problem. At ease, Soldier.

219
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,760
Initiate Employee Evaluation Mode.

220
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,440
- Accessing delivery archive.
- Okay, listen.

221
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,340
You delivered an avian
protein club sandwich

222
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,300
with no lettu... Goddamn it.

223
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:38,020
Oy, scoping for this bit, then?

224
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,300
Alright, a-a-alright.
I know you want to have

225
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,999
the big guy/little guy fight, but...

226
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,420
Aw, are you [BLEEP] kidding me?

227
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,560
Here at the Midland Quasar,

228
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,920
where, in a complete upset,

229
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,059
the Robolution has
overturned the lizards.

230
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,679
- It's totally unexpected.
- Uh, I understand, Mr. Phillips.

231
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,850
Yes.

232
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,800
I believe this is yours.

233
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,240
You, uh... you dropped that.

234
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,190
I'll have to call you back.

235
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,860
Where do you want to die?

236
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,359
Susan, is conference
room three available?

237
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,820
Can I look at a photo of
my wife while you kill me?

238
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,300
Sure, but I'm doing her a favor.

239
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,440
She either has terrible taste,

240
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,660
or she's trapped in a
marriage to a toilet thief.

241
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,449
She's dead.

242
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,019
And I don't mind joining her.

243
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,750
Life has been hollow since I lost her.

244
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,220
Using your toilet was nice, though.

245
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,880
I'm a bit of a shy pooper.

246
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,980
I'm ready when you are.

247
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,750
Stay there.

248
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,880
Tell him what you told me.

249
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,990
What is this? What's happening?

250
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
Tell him what you told me.

251
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,380
My wife's still alive.

252
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,640
Sh... sh... she went into
remission 10 years ago.

253
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,740
And what did you do today?

254
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,109
Oh, I, uh, pooped

255
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,979
on a really awesome toilet I found...

256
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,440
oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, oh!

257
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,660
Don't use your dead wife as an excuse.

258
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,260
You [BLEEP] on my toilet because
you don't know your place,

259
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,050
and your place is nothing.

260
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,860
So next time you stumble onto a toilet

261
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,259
that feels too good for
your ass, trust me, it is.

262
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,329
You're not gonna kill me?

263
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,990

So why the [BLEEP] are you back here?

276
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,269
After you left, I thought
about what you said

277
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,840
and how much I needed to hear it,

278
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,799
but then I thought about
why you were saying it,

279
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,360
who you were really saying it to.

280
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,920
You need the same thing I needed, Rick.

281
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,000
You need someone to give
you, permission to live.

282
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,700
What the... ?

283
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,219
I thought you were a shy pooper.

284
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,120
You know what shy pooping is, Rick?

285
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,060
It's a pointless bid for control.

286
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,500
You want to take the one part of life

287
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,719
that you truly think is yours,
and you want to protect it

288
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,390
from a universe that
takes whatever it wants.

289
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,940
It took my wife.

290
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,980
It clearly took something from you.

291
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,040
We can spend our lives fighting that,

292
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,409
or we can choose to be free.

293
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,780
You're right, Tony. I'm done fighting.

294
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,349
Time to be free.

295
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,390
Oh, wait, you're actually
gonna... Oh, God! Oh, God!

296
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,900
- Where am I?
- Hi, little mouse.

297
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,509
Baby bee? I missed you so much.

298
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,009
I never really left you.

299
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,800
Then you know that a few years ago

300
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,760
- I started getting into...
- Strap-on porn?

301
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,700
Yes. I thought it was hot.

302
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,620
- Now, come on.
- Where are you going?

303
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,810
- To poop.
- Where?

304
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,029
Wherever you want, forever.

305
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,370
My God.

306
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,559
You rang?

307
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,810
I'm pooping, too.

308
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,160
Come, Tony. Come on.

309
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,529
Come poop with me. Poop with me, Tony.

310
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,740
Poop with me.

311
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,240
What are you waiting for?

312
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,180
Aren't you gonna join us, Tony?

313
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:04,290
Aren't you gonna join us in the pooping?

314
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,740
Where are we? What is this?

315
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,020
That's it. Get out.

316
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,440
You can make a perfectly-realized,

317
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,920
toilet-filled simulation of heaven,

318
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,180
but you can't share a toilet?

319
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,540
Don't insult my craft.

320
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,880
The chemical is Globaflyn.

321
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,670
It connects the
whatever-you-want section

322
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,560
of your brain to the
whatever-you-have section.

323
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,740
If your heaven is
toilets, that's on you.

324
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,040
All of these people...

325
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,190
Are living their wildest,
meaningless dreams

326
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,009
and leaving me out of them.

327
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,040
People you refuse to kill and
refuse to let into your life.

328
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,380
An offer you rejected, so
here's your last chance.

329
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,540
Goodbye forever. If you
touch my toilet again,

330
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,740
- you die.
- You need a friend.

331
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,480
I have a million cooler
friends than you.

332
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,880
- I'll be seeing you.
- You'll be dying.

333
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,899
- We're gonna be friends.
- You're gonna be dead.

334
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,800
So, we fight our way to the gas line,

335
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,260
we cut it, and then we set a fire.

336
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,290
Okay. Alright.

337
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,499
Morty, "Adventures of
Jerry and Morty," huh?

338
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,080
- Put her there.
- Dad, look, y-you know,

339
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,300
w-we don't need to high-five.

340
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,420
It's... it's kind of your fault that
we're in this situation at all.

341
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,200
I know, but, you know, come on.

342
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,530
- "Adventures of Jerry and Morty."
- Okay.

343
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,430
Mwah.

344
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,729
Jeff, I can explain everything.

345
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,109
You don't have to.

346
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,399
Can you just marry us instead?

347
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,720
Jeff, don't do it!

348
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,240
Richard.

349
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,040
Maggie.

350
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,020
- Running Bird.
- Let's get out of here.

351
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,940
- Priest Witherspoon.
- Josiah?

352
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,899
Let's get the [BLEEP] out of here.

353
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,820
Summer Smith, let's get
the hell out of here.

354
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,740
You had me at my own name.

355
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,120
Oh, yeah, no. Why would I... ?

356
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,120
Summer! [BLEEP] thing.

357
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,130
Come on. I can't steer this.

358
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,740
What in the hell are you doing?

359
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,950
- Parenting.
- That's not how I did it.

360
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,750
Yeah, where's your daughter?

361
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,550
Ah, you're right.

362
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,940
She joined ISIS.

363
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,540
It's Glootie, and he's
had a change of heart.

364
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,890
And he's going to set us free.

365
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,309
Actually, he's been blamed
for bringing you aboard

366
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,569
and assigned to execute you.

367
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,109
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

368
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,570
What would your girlfriend
think of you murdering?

369
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,440
I happen to be between
relationships right now.

370
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,590
Really? I thought your species
had perfected relationships.

371
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
- Here.
- We're not allowed

372
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,420
- to use those apps.
- I wonder why.

373
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,209
Yeah, that's what I thought, Glootie.

374
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,680
Looks like you and I...

375
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,170
... are all we've got.

376
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,500
I'm not helping you any more than that,

377
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,540
but if you can find the hangar,

378
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,339
grab a ship and get
the hell out of here.

379
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,669
Where you going, Glootie?

380
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,669
I've got a date with
dumping a dating app.

381
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,680
Glootie-ootie-ooh!

382
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,700
- Was that ever his thing?
- No.

383
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,720
- He never exited that way.
- No, first time.

384
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,320
Dad, I want to say something.

385
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,019
I started today disgusted and
embarrassed to be your son,

386
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,570
and then later I thought
we were gonna die

387
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,260
because you're a loser.

388
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,350
- There's no more, is there?
- Nope.

389
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,330
Now quit [BLEEP] up, and let's go.

390
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,880
Is Tony here? I br...
I brought him some, uh,

391
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,130
Vegan Fiber Chili,
delicious family recipe,

392
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,120
and a box of these, uh,
chocolates, sugar free.

393
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,620
He can eat as many of these as he wants.

394
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,420
Anyways, uh, just wanted
to drop these off,

395
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,060
and you tell him, uh,
the toilet's all his.

396
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,429
H-He... he'll know what I mean.

397
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,180
Tony died.

398
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,720
- Excuse me?
- He quit his job,

399
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,040
starting living life to the fullest.

400
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:37,400
He crashed into a tree

401
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,670
space-skiing down Mount Space Everest.

402
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,760
[BLEEP]

403
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,589
There's a Mount Space Everest?

404
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:47,650
Okay. Uh, Jesus.
I-I got to process this.

405
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,260
Oh, no, no. You... you
don't want to eat that.

406
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,490
Y-y-you'll... you'll... you'll become

407
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,420
the opening of "The
Beverly Hillbillies."

408
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,660
You know what I'm saying?
A little bubbling crude?

409
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,800
- Texas tea?
- I don't know these references.

410
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,469
Yeah, but you have a Space Everest?

411
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,560
Watch "Space Beverly Hillbillies"

412
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,160
so my jokes can land,
you [BLEEP] [BLEEP].

413
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,489
Now what?

414
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,851
Happily ever after.

415
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,240
And after that?

416
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,229
We'll find out together.

417
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,239
Summer how many soul mates
is that in the last week?

418
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,159
Four. You can't stop me from
loving who I love, Mom.

419
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,560
Oh, the [BLEEP] I can't.

420
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm gonna mother you
until your 18th birthday,

421
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,439
even if I get thrown in prison
for non-consensual mothering.

422
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,570
And even then, I will break out,

423
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,800
come to your house, kick down your door,

424
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:44,630
and mother your [BLEEP] face
out of your stupid asshole.

425
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,570
I'm gonna daughter your
brains out, bitch.

426
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,050
Mother [BLEEP].

427
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,010
That's my name. Don't wear it out.

428
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:07,429
Gimme dat new soul mate.

429
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,899
Ad wall?

430
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,430
[BLEEP] this.

431
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,319
- Ad wall?
- What, they want us to pay for it now?

432
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,869
Ugh, ad wall?

433
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,110
Come on, Mom. Let's go home.

434
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,110
Great. We lost Earth.

435
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,860
We aren't defined by what we do,

436
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,460
and we only need each other.

437
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,220
Each other... and water.

438
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,379
There's no water?

439
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,900
Honey, the whole point
of conquering Earth...

440
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,809
I know the point of conquering Earth.

441
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,860
- Don't talk to me like...
- Like I'm thirsty?

442
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,760
Like I'm your mother,
you childish prick.

443
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,220
How much water are you sucking

444
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,980
through these stupid [BLEEP]
tubes on your back?

445
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,309
These tubes are cool,
and I want a divorce.

446
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,350
You can have one for a
glass of Goddamn water.

447
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,540
Look, uh, on the off-chance
that you used the app

448
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,829
and there's someone out there
waiting for you, I, uh...

449
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,820
Jerry, I didn't use it. Did you?

450
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,409
Me? No. God, of course not.

451
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,380
Well, then, we're all good, dawg.

452
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,360
Hey, uh... Hey, uh, Tony's dad,

453
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,960
uh, th-this is, um, $8 billion
in your local currency,

454
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,580
and, uh, this is a kit you
can use to clone a new son.

455
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,340
He... he won't have the same brain.

456
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,200
He'll kind of be an animal man,
but you can teach him stuff.

457
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,580
I-I-I also wanted to let you know

458
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,220
I did explore infinite universes,

459
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,689
and there is a version of
Tony that was completely evil

460
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,330
and ended up causing a lot of genocide

461
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,440
because of how fulfilled he was.

462
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,680
So, really, a lot of
ways of looking at this

463
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,940
as not much of a loss.

464
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,360
I understand.

465
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,479
It's, uh, hard losing a friend.

466
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,720
- [BLEEP] you.
- What?

467
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,519
He's not my friend.

468
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,680
There he is. There's our guy.

469
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,769
Congrats, Tony.

470
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,380
Have fun with your stupid toilet

471
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,500
that you get to use all by yourself now.

472
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,760
Enjoy using it all by
yourself while you sit there

473
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,480
and think about how nobody
wants to be around you

474
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,040
and how you ruined it for yourself

475
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,570
because you're a huge piece of [BLEEP].

476
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,580
Look at you sitting there,

477
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,929
King Shit on his throne of loneliness.

478
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,240
Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me

479
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,550
screaming every time you take a [BLEEP].

480
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,720
All hail his majesty,

481
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,859
the sa-a-ddest piece of
garbage in the entire cosmos.

482
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,129
Long live the big, bad, doo-doo daddy.

483
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:36,459
May his reign last 1,000 years.

485
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,330
Rick, did you take the Tapatío?

486
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,850
Hmm, Globaflyn?

487
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,200
Thanks.

488
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,469
- I could never lift it up.
- No problem.

489
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,969
I'll be able to drink water
for weeks because of you.

490
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,980
It's just part of my job, ma'am.

491
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,400
Breaker one nine, this is Jerry Smith.

492
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,140
Uh, just finished my first
delivery of the day.

493
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,610
900 more to go.
