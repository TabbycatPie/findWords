1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,550
我今天要带客户看房
I have to show a house today,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,340
直接在卢克的橄榄球赛上见吧
so see you guys at Luke's football games.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,320
我累死了才不去
I'm too tired to go.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,560
我明天有期中考试
I have a midterm tomorrow

5
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,370
很有可能会挂  我昨晚学习到很晚
which I'll probably fail. And I was up really late studying.

6
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,350
是真的呢  我昨晚就这样吃惊到很晚
She was. I was up really late doing this.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,560
没必要费劲跑一趟了  我今天不想参加
Don't even bother coming. I'm quitting today.

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,270
我受够了队里一个家伙总是取笑我
I'm sick of this guy in the team always making fun of me.

9
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,050
他那是嫉妒
He's just jealous because

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,890
因为你才是给记分牌上加分的人
you're the one who puts points on the board.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,540
为什么呢
Why?

12
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,810
-因为你负责记分  -负责记分
- Because you run the scoreboard. - ...run the scoreboard.

13
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,610
我也不去了
I'm out, too.

14
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:27,160
但你的同学们都会去呢
But all your classmates will be there.

15
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,700
我们一整周都互不理睬
We ignore each other all week.

16
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,290
周末歇歇也好啊
It's nice to have a little break on the weekends.

17
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,070
老天  我从没见过这么多"被拒者"
Geez, I've never seen such a bunch of no-getters.

18
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,020
造词成功
Coined it!

19
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,870
记住  保持乐观心态
Remember, keep a positive attitude,

20
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,530
好事自然会发生
and good things will happen.

21
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,870
我每次带客户看房都带着两样东西
Two things I bring to every open house --

22
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,440
我的幸运钢笔和微笑
my lucky pen and a smile.

23
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,920
我整个月都没卖出一套房
I haven't sold a house all month.

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,050
你们有听到我说"我不干了"吗  没有
Do you see me saying "I'm done"? Never.

25
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,430
因为邓菲家字典里没有"完了"这个词
Because there is no "Done" in Dunphy.

26
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,500
我们比赛时见
I'll see you guys at the game.

27
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,730
邓菲家字典里也没有"好烦"这个词
Hey, there is no "Umph" in Dunph--

28
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,990
拼法不一样
different spelling!

29
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,420
小卡
Cam!

30
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,550
菲尔  我记得你的特别战术
Yes, Phil, I remember your special play,

31
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,770
但我认为在这样一场重要的赛事上
but I think the triple gull-wing is a little tricky

32
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,000
用三路包抄的战术有点不靠谱
to run at such an important sporting match.

33
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,970
小卡在橄榄球赛季总会有一些
Cam has a number of delightful superstitions

34
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,110
可爱的迷信行为
during the football season.

35
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,210
管用的话就不是迷信行为
Well, they're not superstitions when they work.

36
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,780
好像很科学啊
That seems science-y.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,960
好在今天是最后一场"波以  死爱"
Not sorry that today is the last g-a-m-e.

38
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,220
谢谢  但好教练不需要靠运气
Well, thank you, but good coaches don't need luck.

39
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,840
我们制造运气
We make luck.

40
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,720
我们在"体育活动"中见吧
See you at the athletic endeavor.

41
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,130
我要给歌洛莉亚打电话
I'm going to call Gloria

42
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,670
看她能不能去接莉莉
and see if she can pick up Lily, too,

43
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,690
以防...
you know, just in case...

44
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,960
怎么  你又要犯拖延症
What, you procrastinate again

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,330
不跟查理提辞职吗
and not tell Charlie you're quitting?

46
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,490
不是的  我会提的
No, no! I'm gonna do it.

47
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,840
我只是  一想到我告诉他时
I just -- I'm picturing his face when I tell him,

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,560
他失望摇头的表情  就觉得
shaking his head in disappointment.

49
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,900
很难开口
It's -- it's hard.

50
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,810
-提就是了  -不行
- Hey, just do it! - No.

51
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,270
我不明白这件事你为什么要这样逼疯自己
I don't know why you're making yourself so crazy over this.

52
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,080
你说得对  你说得对
You're right. You're right.

53
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,620
我  我可不想发疯
I -- I do not want to be crazy.

54
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,200
比赛时见
I'll see you at the game.

55
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,440
歌洛莉亚
Hey, Gloria.

56
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,520
好  米奇  我会去接她
Yes, Mitch, I will pick her up.

57
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,030
太感谢了  好了  再见  莉莉
Thank you so much! All right. Bye, Lily.

58
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,770
祝你和帕特里克发展顺利
Good luck with the whole Patrick situation.

59
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,010
爸爸  你这样让我很丢脸
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

60
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,320
欢迎进入你的人生新阶段  亲爱的
Well, welcome to the rest of your life, sweetheart.

61
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,660
莉莉  跟我说说这个帕特里克的事吧
So, Lily, tell me more about this Patrick.

62
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,230
他喜欢荡秋千  坐在国旗旁边
He likes the swings, he sits by the flag,

63
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,100
而且他可以一直数到一百呢
and he can count to 100.

64
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,750
听起来很完美啊
He sounds like the whole package.

65
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,920
那问题出在哪里
Then what is the problem?

66
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,240
他的眼里没有我
He doesn't notice me.

67
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,330
那就让他注意到你啊
So then make him notice you.

68
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,040
你可不想到九岁那年
You don't want to wake up one morning

69
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,220
醒来发现自己还孤身一人
as a lonely 9-year-old,

70
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,720
心中感叹过去的时光一片空白
wondering where all the time went.

71
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,150
老妈  如果你一会儿去超市
Hey, mom. If you're at the store later,

72
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,320
能买点冰回来吗
could you pick up some ice?

73
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,610
比赛后我需要用
I'm gonna need it for after the game.

74
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,650
真不愧是我的小运动员
My little athlete.

75
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,240
我想试试我卖了自行车换来的冰淇淋机
I want to try out the gelato maker I traded my bike for.

76
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,000
每次我都想太多了
Lures me in every time.

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,520
好  再见
Oh, okay. Bye.

78
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,710
爸  你可以在下个红绿灯把我放下来
Dad, you can just drop me at the next light.

79
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,520
我可以从那走过去
I can walk from there,

80
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,810
正要我需要给菲尔打个电话
and I got to call Phil anyway.

81
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,850
你昨天也这样
You did the same thing yesterday.

82
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,180
为什么啊  你怎么啦
Why? What's going on with you?

83
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,760
-你又开始抽烟了吗  -没有  不是
- You smoking again? - No! No.

84
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,900
我只是  我不想让大家注意到
I just -- I don't want to put a spotlight

85
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,520
我是老板的女儿
on the fact that I'm the boss's daughter.

86
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,460
这会让人讨厌我
It makes people resent me.

87
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,930
-这里就好  谢谢老爸  -好吧
- This is good. Thanks, dad. - Yeah.

88
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,000
-再见  -再见
- Bye. - Bye.

89
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,520
看得出来那让你很苦恼啊
I can see that bothers you.

90
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,520
是啊  自己的孩子
Well, yeah, your own kid,

91
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,720
觉得被看到和你在一起很丢脸
embarrassed to be seen with you,

92
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,510
你能理解吗
you know what I mean?

93
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,970
-你一辈子都在...  -到这里就好
- You spend your whole life...  - Here's fine.

105
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,250
上个月  我在法学院的一位同学邀请我
Last month, a law-school classmate offered me a job

106
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,560
去他的法律援助协会工作
at his legal aid society,

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,190
直觉告诉我  我得接受
and I just knew I had to take it.

108
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,370
我写了封信解释这个情况
And I explained that in a letter

109
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,730
并打算偷偷放在查理的办公桌上
that I was going to sneak onto Charlie's desk.

110
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,340
太好了  是你啊
Oh, good. It's you.

111
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,460
你在这里睡的吗
Did you sleep here?

112
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,570
我女朋友把我甩了  通过电邮
My girlfriend dumped me, uh, in an e-mail.

113
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,410
连当面提分手都不敢
Couldn't even do it face-to-face.

114
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,300
真够懦弱的  是吧
Pretty gutless, huh?

115
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,640
你应该回家  休息一下
Oh, you should go home, get some rest.

116
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,780
我不能回去  太艰难了
I can't go back there. It would be too hard.

117
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,060
太多回忆吗
Mm, too many memories?

118
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,320
不是  我们之前住在我的船上
No, we were living on my boat.

119
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,650
我不知道她把船开哪儿去了
I don't know where she took it.

120
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,200
不发牢骚了  你有什么事
Enough of my whining. What do you need?

121
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,690
我就是  我就过来打个招呼  你好啊
Oh, well, I just -- I just came by to say hi. Hi.

122
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,970
然后顺便用很敞亮的方式告诉你
And also, mm, to tell you in a very gut-ful fashion,

123
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,020
当面提出来
face-to-face,

124
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,040
我一直在考虑的事情
about something that I have been thinking about.

125
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,010
但我真的觉得  我今天不得不
But I do think that, um, I am going to have to leave

126
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,780
提早五分钟下班了
about five minutes early today.

小卡在给一支高中橄榄球队做教练
Uh, Cam is -- is coaching a high-school football game.

128
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,170
-我要去  -你说啥
- I'm in. - What?

129
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,400
我今天肯定是没心情做这些了
Certainly not gonna be able to focus on any of this today.

130
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,060
是的  我需要去看看仪仗队
Yeah, I need a shot of marching bands,

131
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,090
修剪一新的草坪和脸颊粉红的少年们
fresh-cut grass, rosy-cheeked kids.

132

[美式橄榄球开场前运动员有跑步穿过广告横幅的传统]

133
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,280
他们还会跑步穿过横幅吗
Do they still run through a banner?

134
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,540
-会的  -我超爱那个  超爱
- They do! - I love that. I love that.

135
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,350
所以比赛大概四点开始对吗
OK. So the game's at what, like, 4:00?

136
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,570
我们应该  把那个给我
We should probably -- hey! Give me that.

137
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,770
我
I'm --

138
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,230
这是我的私人号码
This is my private cell.

139
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,450
全世界只有三个人可以打这个号码
Only three people in the whole world use this.

140
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,700
现在是两个人了
Two people.

141
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,810
克莱尔  你为什么
Uh, Claire, is, uh -- is there a reason

142
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,110
没在这张货运单上签字
you didn't sign this shipping form?

143
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,900
不好意思  我立刻签
Oh, no. Sorry. I'll do it now.

144
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,640
现在签有点晚了
Oh, no. No. Now's a little late.

145
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,850
运输公司早上来过了
See, they came in this morning,

146
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,080
没有经理签字什么也做不了
and they can't do a thing without a manager's signature.

147
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,570
所以现在库房里堆了一百块红木板
So now I've got 100 rosewood panels lined up in the warehouse.

148
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,940
以后我希望你能...
On the future, I'd appreciate it --

149

蒂姆  我觉得你已经说清楚了
Hey, hey, Tim. I think you made your point.

150
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,180
只是个无心之过而已
It was an honest mistake, all right?

151
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,560
-爸  -库房不就是用来
- Dad. - I'm just saying that it's what a warehouse is for,

153

-抱歉  -我才需要抱歉
- Sorry. - No, I'm sorry.

我早上不是在车上跟你说过了嘛
This is exactly what I was talking about in the car this morning!

158
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,520
我希望他们把我当成同事
I want them to see me like a co-worker,

159
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,160
而不是仗着是老板的女儿
not somebody who's getting special treatment

160
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,330
就拥有特权的人
'cause she's the boss' daughter.

161
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,280
你是不是有点过于敏感了
Is it possible you're being a little oversensitive here?

162
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,720
我才没有  我这是...不是吧
No, I'm not. I'm being -- wow, here? Really?!

163
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,020
这是你给我的
You know, you gave me this.

164
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,070
-看看你当时多可爱  -行了行了
- Look how adorable you were. - Okay. Okay. Okay.

165
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,950
我希望你能认真听进去我说的话
I want you to try really hard to hear what I'm saying.

166

需要帮助的时候我会找你的
When I need your help, I will ask for it.

167

但在那以前  不要多管闲事
And until then, just butt out.

168
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,330
你怎么变成这样了
What happened to you?

米勒  你的脚指头看起来有点孤单
Hey, Miller, your toes are looking a little lonely.

170
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,800
你怎么不去拜访一下它们
Why don't you pay them a visit?

171
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,290
教练  为什么要做这么多热身运动
What's with the extra warm-ups, coach?

这帮人一整年都没赢过比赛
These guys haven't won all year.

Did you hear that, team?

Same way you're a spaz and a dork at the same time, spork.

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,540
曾经有段时间
For a while there,

249
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,350
我们感觉像在被上帝捉弄
it seemed like the universe was against us.

250
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,120
不可能的
That's ridiculous.

251
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
上帝怎么会闲到跟一个人对着干
Why would the universe be against one person?

252
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,490
给你贴张士气贴
Here, have a spirit sticker!

253
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,390
大家都有贴哦
Don't be the only student without one.

254
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,730
我才是这学校的好吗
I actually go to this school!

255
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,210
你还真是路人甲啊
Wow, you really are invisible, huh?

256
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,000
这样再好不过了
I could not be more fine with it.

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,580
你特别像一部电影里的角色
You're like that guy from that movie

258
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,200
他希望自己没来过人世
who wishes he was never born.

259
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,760
《生活多美好》
"It's a Wonderful Life".

260
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,660
你嘴上这么说  可真这么想吗
You say that, but do you mean it?

261
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,320
[海豚橄榄球队]

262
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,320
雷德・斯塔格球场赢来了美好的一天
Beautiful day here at Red Stagg field.

263
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,910
开球的是主场作战的44号
Kicking off for the home team is number 44,

264
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,840
杰森・米勒
Jason Miller,

265
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,070
该球员还是长曲棍球以及足球运动员
who also plays lacrosse, soccer, and all the girl parts

266
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,390
还在和死党们一起出演的《歌舞青春》里
when he and his friends act out

267
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,730
扮演了所有女生角色
"High School Musical".

268
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,640
[Girl parts有女性角色和女生私处两个意思]

269
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,640
很可能是他此生看到女生私处的唯一机会
Quite possibly the only girl parts he'll ever see.

270
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,220
海莉
Haley!

271
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,840
你好啊  迪伦
Hey, Dylan!

272
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,550
我都不知道你会过来
I didn't realize you were coming here.

273
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,490
开玩笑呢
Are you kidding?

274
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,120
这地方对我来说像家一样
This place was like a home to me.

275
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,850
就好像我是在家里上学一样
It's like I was homeschooled.

276
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,680
但并不是  我是在学校里上的学
But I wasn't. I was school-schooled.

277
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,770
是么
Were you?

278
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,710
我兜里有六种药
I got six kinds of pills in my pocket,

279
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,550
但来看少年们比赛才是最好的治疗
but this here, all this, this is the best medicine.

280
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,390
我很高兴你感觉好点了
Aw, I'm glad you're feeling better.

281
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,330
是这样的  查理  我
So, Charlie, I --

282
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,790
我是来接莉莉的
I'm here to get Lily.

283
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,740
去叫她前我要跟您说一下今天出的小事故
Oh, before I call her, we had a small issue today.

284
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,250
有个叫帕特里克的男孩说莉莉把他推倒
One of the boys, Patrick, said Lily pushed him down

285
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,600
还要亲他
and tried to kiss him.

286
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,580
不可能  莉莉很高冷的
No, that doesn't sound like Lily.

287
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,810
她可能是在模仿在电视上
She was probably imitating something she saw

288
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,430
或家里看到的情景
on TV or in her family --

289
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,140
一定是在电视上看到的
Ay, it was the TV, yes.

290
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,980
她来了  你看她多可爱啊
Oh, but here she is. She's always so sweet.

291
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,980
再见  帕特里克
Bye, Patrick.

292
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,370
看到了吗  他们只是好朋友
You see? They're just friends.

293
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,080
你笑个屁啊  埃文
What are you laughing at, Evan?

294
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,420
下一个就是你
You're next.

295
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,020
好吧  我会跟她单独谈谈的
Okay, I'm going to talk to her for a little bit.

296
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,200
我跟你说过我把你名字写到那上面吗
Oh, did I ever tell you that I put your name up here?

297
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,340
什么
Huh?

298
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,300
海莉・邓菲的小巨蛋
"Haley Dunphy dome."

299
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,560
真好  你还给我们的专属地点命名了
Aww, you named our special spot?

300
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,220
其实我本来想写"海莉・邓菲请摸我蛋"的
Actually it was supposed to be "Haley Dunphy, do me."

301
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,190
我不太会控制单词间的距离
I'm bad with spacing.

302
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,850
你没那么糟糕啦
Oh, you're not so bad.

303
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,120
中场休息  黑豹队6比0领先海豚队
And that's halftime -- Panthers 6, Dolphins 0.

304
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,990
0分是由杰森・米勒
That zero score by Jason Miller,

305
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,090
骄傲地跑出界造成的
who proudly prances off the field.

306
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,140
别拦我  我要上去踹那小子两脚
Just let me go up there and kick that kid's butt.

307
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,500
行了米勒  你的腿是用来跑的
Knock it off, Miller. I need your leg.

308
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,470
都单腿跪下
Take a knee.

309
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,530
我不知道你们这些小海豚游进了什么陷阱
Now, I don't know what tuna net you Dolphins swam into,

310
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,330
但你们快完蛋了啊
but you are drowning out there!

311
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,900
教练  输了的话有那么糟糕吗
Coach, would it really be such a bad thing if we lost?

312
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,000
-你说什么  -你看看他们
- Beg your pardon? - Look at them, coach.

313
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,630
他们还不够惨吗
Haven't they lost enough already?

314
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,210
也许让他们赢一次
Maybe giving them a win would,

315
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,970
在某种程度上也是成全了我们自己
in a way, be a victory for us, too.

316
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,450
你知道什么对于奈特教练最重要吗
Okay, you know what mattered the most to coach Knight?

317
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,770
照顾那些残疾儿童吗
His work with special-needs kids?

318
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,820
他只不过带了一个孩子去过一次海边而已
Okay, he took one kid to one beach one time.

319
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,980
是橄榄球
Football!

320
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,520
橄榄球才是最重要的
Football is what mattered the most!

321
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,330
他为胜利而活
He lived for competition!

322
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,740
他的信仰是运动员精神  一种气节
He believed in sportsmanship, integrity!

323
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,040
懂吗  我认为  你们大可以上场
Okay? Now, the way I see it, we can roll over

324
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,510
让他们轻松获胜  但那毫无意义
and give them an empty, meaningless victory

325
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,290
他在九泉之下也不会开心的
that he... would hate.

326
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,620
但我们可以自信上场  使出浑身解数
Or we can go out there, leave it all on the field,

327
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,010
让他输也输得心服口服
and be a team he would be proud to lose to.

328
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,420
告诉我  你们是一个人还是一个团队
Now, is this an "I" activity or a "We" activity?!

329
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,560
-团队  -听不见
- We! - What?!

330
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,360
-团队  -听不见
- We! - What?!

331
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,920
-团队  团队  团队  -这就对了
- We! We! We! We! We! We! - That's right!

332
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,780
你看你们连叫声都像海豚了
Now you sound like dolphins!

333
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,410
你好  蒂姆
Hey, Tim!

334
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,010
接下来三天的发货单给你
I got the next three days of delivery slips

335
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,500
都签好了  不错吧
for you here, signed, huh?

336
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,220
-谢谢你  克莱尔  -没事
- Thanks, Claire. - Yeah.

337
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,440
都签好字了哦
Signed those up good, huh?

338
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:45,680
多谢
Thanks.

339
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,690
这个  这就是桦木家具啊
So, this is -- this is the, uh, the regency birch?

340
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,540
真不错  好看
Beautiful model. Gorgeous.

341
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,460
你们在这边做的工作很棒
You guys do such good work down here.

342
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,890
我说真的  介意我在它们被送到
Really, you mind if I take her for a spin

343
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,110
展厅之前先参观下吗
before she goes up to the showroom?

344
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,390
-随意  你是老大  -...的闺女
- You're the boss... - 's daughter.

345
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,370
我知道这才是你的心里话
That's what you want to say.

346
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,460
为了运输方便没有装镜子  有道理
Oh, okay. So, no mirror when they're shipping, which makes sense.

347
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,030
而且  也没把手啊
Also have, uh... no handles.

348
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,170
蒂姆
Hey -- hey, Tim?

349
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,110
蒂姆
Hey, Tim!

350
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,550
蒂姆
Tim!

351
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,570
我的天  喂  爸
Oh, god. Yeah, hi, dad.

352
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,700
你好  同事
Hey, co-worker.

353
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,490
我就问问你几点出发去看比赛
Just seeing when you want to leave for the game.

354
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,150
-我们已经迟到了  -马上  马上
- We're late already. - Soon, soon.

355
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,500
我  我在  我在收工了
I'm -- I'm just -- I'm finishing up

356
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,080
我办公室里有点儿文书工作
a little paperwork in my office.

357
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,790
好吧  需要帮忙的话跟我说一声
Okay. Let me know if you need any help.

358
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,040
不用  我不需要你帮忙
No, I do not need your help.

359
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,030
而且我相信我说过了  我希望你
And as I believe I mentioned, I would appreciate it

360
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,790
不要总是严密监视着我
if you were not constantly looking over my shoulder.

361
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,910
拜托  别把我想得那么差劲
Come on. Give me some credit.

362
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,480
我绝对不会那么做的
That's the last thing I would do.

363
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,140
爸  你好像忘了我成功养大了三个孩子
Dad, you seem to forget that I raised three children,

364
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,850
而且在那之前我还有份事业
and I had a career before this.

365
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,180
我做了很多不...
I have done plenty of stuff that does not --

366
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,870
你听到了吗
Do you hear that?

367
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,060
听起来是从库房传来的声音
Sounds like it's coming from the warehouse.

368
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,640
是啊  那是什么声音
Yeah, what even is that?

369
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,060
我确定没什么大不了的
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

370
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
给你个建议  听不听由你
Uh, one piece of advice -- take it or leave it.

371
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,780
什么
What?

372
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,680
门闩在嵌板的右下方
The latch is under the panel on the right.

373
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,660
我给你买了你喜欢的芥末泡菜
I got you mustard and sauerkraut, just what you like.

374
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,750
你这么友善有点儿吓人
You're being awfully nice,

375
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,860
我刚才可是掀起了一场衣柜龙卷风
considering I started that whole closet-nado.

376
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,080
你仍然是我闺女
Well, you're still my daughter.

377
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,790
我在这里可以这么叫你吧
It's okay I call you that here, right?

378
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,780
可以
Yeah.

379
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,730
听着  我很难像对其他人那样对待你
Listen, it's hard for me to treat you like everyone else.

380
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,990
你是唯一一个被我抱着回家的人
You're the only one I carried home in my arms --

381
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,230
除了去年圣诞派对上的唐雷尔
Except Dontrell, last year's Christmas party.

382
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,540
我几乎是把他从汽车天窗里灌进去的
I pretty much poured him through his sunroof.

383
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,510
但我会尽力
But I'll try.

384
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,900
-谢谢  爸  -你这周末有安排吗
-Thanks, dad.  -You got plans this weekend?

385
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,540
-还没有  怎么了  -很好
- No. Not really. Why? - Good.

386
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,330
明天早上8点到库房
Be at the warehouse, 8:00 tomorrow.

387
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,650
别穿太好的衣服
Wear something you don't care about.

388
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,100
伙计们
Hey, guys.

389
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,080
你好  亲爱的
Hi, honey.

390
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,030
战况如何
What'd I miss?

391
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,150
不太好
Nothing good.

392
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,240
只剩3分钟了  还差6分
We're down by 6 with 3 minutes to play.

393
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,040
他们还是有可能转败为胜的
Well, they could still turn it around.

394
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,190
[The show is not over till the fat lady sings.]
[比赛尚未完全结束之前不能确定胜负]

395
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,190
比赛还没完全结束...  妈呀
Show's not over till the fat -- mama!

396
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,880
米勒震撼人心的凌空一脚
Sensational punt by Miller, who hasn't kicked that high

397
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,410
自从他打破性别界限
since he broke the gender barrier

398
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,410
加入现代舞队以来  从没踢过那么高
and joined our own modern dance troupe.

399
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,860
-你还好吧  亲爱的  -还好
- Are you okay, honey? - Yeah!

400
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,310
一切在于保持心观乐态
It's all about keeping an attitive positude.

401
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,860
乐心观态
Positude attitive.

402
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,880
我们今晚应该去看夜场电影
Hey, we should see a midnight movie tonight,

403
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,820
像以前那样
like old times.

404
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,530
太棒了  我要去
Oh, my god. I am so in!

405
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,770
好  好极了
Cool. Cool.

406
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,110
我11点半左右带着梯子去你家找你吧
I'll come by your house around 11:30 with the ladder?

407
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,500
我不需要从窗子偷偷爬出去了   迪兰
I don't need to climb out of my window anymore, Dylan.

408
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,550
可以早点儿吗  我明天期中考试
Oh, ooh. Can we do it earlier? I have a midterm tomorrow.

409
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,890
我早不了
Oh, I can't do earlier.

410
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,430
我得和几个护士学校的同学见面
I've got to meet up with some classmates from nursing school.

411
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,070
你要当护士吗
You're gonna be a nurse?

412
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,700
是的  我觉得这是我注定的发展方向
Yeah, I figured it was a natural next step.

413
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,570
我一直在用音乐为人们疗伤
I've always healed people with my music,

414
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,060
[drug也表示麻醉剂  毒品]

415
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,060
现在我不过是要用药物做同样的事情
and now I'm just doing the same thing with drugs.

416
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,630
好吧  那就下次吧
Wow. Well, ye-- another time, then.

417
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,570
-好的  -好的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

418
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,170
如果一切顺利的话
Hey, if everything goes well,

419
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,160
也许有一天我会在医院里见到你
maybe one day I'll see you in the hospital.

420
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,530
我很乐意
I'd like that.

421
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,050
最后我终于从衣柜里出来了
So, I finally get out of the closet,

422
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,120
爸就在那里鄙视地看着我
and there's dad looking down at me.

423
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,140
我知道那感觉
Been there.

424
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,470
但是和父亲之间这种微妙的关系
The whole daddy thing, though,

425
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,950
一直是你的一大难题
it's really one of your bigger issues.

426
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,620
至少我的问题是和我亲爸之间的
At least my daddy issues are with my actual daddy.

427
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,690
我不会把我认识的每个权威人物
I don't run around making every authority figure

428
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,180
都当爹一样对待
I meet into a father.

429
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,060
等等
Wait.

430
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,130
你这是什么意思
W-what's that supposed to mean?

431
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,530
米奇尔  拜托
Mitchell, come on.

432
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,350
你为什么还没跟你老板提辞职
Why have you not quit your job yet?

433
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,660
他女朋友刚把他甩了
His girlfriend just broke up with him.

434
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,100
好吧  那你上个星期的借口是什么
Yeah, and what was your excuse last week?

435
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,830
我感冒了
I had a cold.

436
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,580
上上个星期呢
And the week before?

437
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,920
我感觉快要感冒了
I felt a cold coming on.

438
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,530
米奇尔  这封信从你外套里掉出来了
Mitchell, this fell out of your jacket.

439
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:31,980
能给个解释吗
Care to explain?

440
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,250
我是替一个朋友存放的
I was holding it for a friend.

441
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,830
你要辞职吗
You want to quit?

442
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,440
查理  你  你是个好老板
Charlie, you're -- you're a great boss,

443
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,890
但我接到了另一份工作邀请
but I ju-- I got this other offer,

444
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,880
我真的很想念在法庭上辩论的感觉
and I just really miss the courtroom.

445
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,260
我跟你说实话
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you,

446
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,360
你  真的让我很失望
you're... really letting me down.

447
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,300
我对你有更高的期望
I just expected so much more out of you.

448
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,330
你是我的最喜欢的员工
Ohh. You were my favorite.

449
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,970
天啊
Ohh, god.

450
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,600
也许  我可以在周末给你做事
Um, well, maybe I-I could still do things on the weekends.

451
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,300
不  不  查理  我  我很抱歉
No, no! Charlie, I'm -- I'm sorry.

452
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,400
我  我不干了
I -- I'm done.

453
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,940
你知道吗
You know what?

454
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,930
我不怪你
I don't blame you.

455
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,260
我必须得重新脚踏实地[回到陆地上来]
I have to get back on solid ground.

456
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,710
-彼此彼此  -我比你更需要
- We both do. - Well, I do more.

457
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,180
我住在船上
My house is a boat.

458
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,480
你害我惹上麻烦了
You made me in trouble.

459
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,190
我可没有教你靠扑倒对方来追男孩子
I didn't tell you to sit on a boy until he liked you.

460
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,500
-你就是这么教的  -不是
- Yes-huh. - Nuh-huh.

461
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,060
我不会再听你的建议了
We're not doing this again.

462
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,880
主队申请暂停
Home team calls time-out.

463
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,970
还剩12秒  落后6分
12 seconds left, they're down by 6,

464
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,140
很难摆脱米勒诅咒了
and unable to shake the Miller curse.

465
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,290
我受够了
That's it!

466
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,030
好了  孩子们  最后一搏了
Okay, boys, final play.

467
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,460
让我们使个小诈
Time for a little trickery.

468
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,740
亲爱的  你今天怎么了
Oh, honey. What happened to you today?

469
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,120
上帝给了我一个打击
A cosmic pummeling.

470
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,040
我这笔生意泡汤了
I lost the deal.

471
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,670
如果明天不赶着卖一套
If I don't close on one tomorrow,

472
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,770
这将是我有史以来第一个"无销售月"
it's gonna be my first month ever with no sale.

473
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,320
事实上  这个月没有31号
Actually, there is no 31st this month.

474
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,310
你说什么
What are you talking about?

475
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,450
明天就是1号了
Tomorrow's the first.

476
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,740
亲爱的  抱歉  你还好吗
Honey, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

477
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,500
不  我很不好
No, I'm not okay!

478
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,600
我才发现我已经没有明天了
I just found out there is literally no tomorrow!

479
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,360
我总说  如果坚持等待
You know, I always say if you wait long enough,

480
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,410
幸运之神总会降临
your luck will change?

481
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,140
结果等来的只是一堆垃...
Turns out that's just a big pile of c--

482
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,610
坐稳了  朋友们
Hold on to your hats, folks.

483
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,940
是吗  是的  这就是三路包抄
Are they? They are! It's the triple gull-wing!

484
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,000
这是我排的策略
That's my play!

485
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,630
伍德森假装往右  他又一次假装往右
Woodson fakes right, he fakes right again,

486
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,410
他假装要假装向右  他得分了
he fakes faking right, and he scores!

487
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,040
他们用我的策略得分了
They scored on my play!

488
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,830
-米奇尔说你可以卖房给我  -没错
- Mitchell says you can sell me a house. - Yes, I can!

489
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,360
-菲尔干得好  这是你排的吗  -是
- Good call, Phil. Was that your play?! - Yes, it was!

490
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,650
你表现得太野蛮了  莉莉
You're being too rough, Lily.

491
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,340
你不能看见一个男人
You cannot just see a guy and,

492
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,390
就这么上去亲他  懂吗
mwah, kiss him like that, okay?

493
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,290
你可以  你可以的
Yes, you can! Yes, you can!

494
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,770
米勒出局了  曼尼  你是替补开球手
Okay! Okay! Miller's out. Manny, you're my backup kicker.

495
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,920
我需要你上去拿下这脚球
I need you to go out there and nail this.

496
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,790
即使我踢不中
Although if I miss it,

497
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,230
平局何尝不是一个完美的方式
wouldn't a tie be a perfect way to --

498
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,270
曼尼  够了
Manny, enough!

499
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,130
你不能夺走我的胜利
You are not gonna take away my victory!

500
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,990
我是说  你们的胜利
I mean -- I mean, your victory.

501
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,250
好吗
Okay?

502
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,380
曼尼  抱歉  我不该吼你的
Manny, I'm sorry. I should not have yelled at you.

503
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,510
你尽管过去  做你觉得正确的事
You can go out there and do whatever feels right.

504
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,630
好吗  不管怎样我都支持你
Okay? I support you no matter what.

505
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,950
准备  发射
Hut! Hut! Hike!

506
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,850
我赢了  我赢了  我是说我们赢了
I won! I won! I mean, we won!

507
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,240
我们赢了  我们赢了
We won! We won!

508
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,980
抱歉  女士
Ooph! Sorry, ma'am.

509
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,590
女士  英语课我就坐你边上
Ma'am? I sit next to you in English.

510
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,470
我好像把手机落在看台下面了
Hey, I think I dropped my phone under the bleachers.

511
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,350
和我去拿一下好吗
Come get it with me?

512
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,820
找到了
Found it.

513
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,380
太好了  世界又平静了
Great, and world order is restored.

514
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,350
-可以回家了吗  -可以
- Can we go home now? - Yeah. Okay.

515
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,900
看  这是什么
Oh, hey, what's that?

516
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,510
艾丽克斯・邓菲的小巨蛋
"Alex Dunphy dome?"

517
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:28,610
我觉得是"艾丽克斯・邓菲请摸我蛋"
Uh, I think it says "Alex Dunphy, do me."

518
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,560
谁会写这种东西
Ugh, who would write something like that?

519
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:31,870
不知道
No idea.

520
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,330
需要我帮你擦掉吗
Hey, you want me to scratch it out?

521
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,550
不  我是说  太晚了
No! I mean, pfft, too late now.

522
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,650
已经写在那了  就这样吧
If it's out there, it's out there.

523
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,750
小冠军
Hey, champ.

524
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,750
不去和大家庆祝一下吗
Aren't you gonna go celebrate with your team?

525
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,100
去  等会就去
Yeah, in a minute.

526
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,880
你本来是不打算踢中的  对吗
You meant to miss the kick, didn't you?

527
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,820
我搞砸了
I blew it.

528
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,570
十次我有九次踢不中
I could miss that kick nine out of ten times.

529
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,820
怎么真正需要踢不中的时候却踢中了呢
Why couldn't I miss it when it counted?

530
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,870
让我来问问你
Let me ask you something.

531
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,120
当球穿过球门
That ball sails through the uprights,

532
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,530
队员们举着你走出球场
your team carries you off the field.

533
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,610
那感觉怎样
How does that feel?

534
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,170
-说啊  -感觉很好
- Come on. - Good.

535
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,560
成为团队一员很开心
It's fun being part of a team.

536
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,680
成为大英雄更是开心
And it's really fun being the hero.

537
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,080
所以我觉得  你是特意要踢中的
So I think you made that kick on purpose.

538
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,470
听我说
And listen.

539
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,620
你现在也许还不想承认
I don't think you're willing to admit it yet,

540
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,260
但在每个人性深处
but somewhere underneath all that humanity,

541
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,690
都有一个争强好胜者  抱歉
there's a competitor -- sorry.

542
