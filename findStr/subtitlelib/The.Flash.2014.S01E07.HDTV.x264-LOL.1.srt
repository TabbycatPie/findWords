1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,061
My name is Barry Allen,
and I'm the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:09,360
When I was a child, I saw my mother
killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,153 --> 00:00:11,581
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:15,913
Then an accident made me the impossible.

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,481
To the outside world,

6
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:19,914
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,746
but secretly I use my speed to fight crime

8
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:24,311
and find others like me,

9
00:00:24,313 --> 00:00:26,913
and one day I'll find
who killed my mother...

10
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:29,546
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

11
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:32,240
I am The Flash.

12
00:00:32,242 --> 00:00:34,178
Previously on The Flash...

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,743
Ronnie!

14
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:38,441
17 people died that night;
Many more were injured.

15
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:40,837
I'm not the most popular person
in town these days.

16
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,704
We're just supposed to get used to working

17
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:44,705
above a makeshift prison

18
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:47,308
housing evil people with superpowers.

19
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,805
What is this?

20
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:51,207
Somewhere you'll never
hurt anyone ever again.

21
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:59,642
- Farooq!
- It's not safe.

22
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:01,441
Come down.

23
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:02,704
Farooq, I'm serious.

24
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:03,938
It's gonna rain.

25
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,205
Y'all are tripping.

26
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:07,004
This is the best seat in the house.

27
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:08,269
Whoo!

28
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:09,934
You know, when I said we should watch

29
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,502
the particle accelerator turn on,

30
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:16,401
I just meant we should get naked
and howl at the moon.

31
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:18,001
It's already on.

32
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:19,300
Consider me unimpressed.

33
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:22,667
Whoo!

34
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:23,868
Yeah, baby.

35
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:27,898
Oh.

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,999
- This is awesome.
- Are you seeing this?

37
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,400
Oh, man, I think I am tripping.

38
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:36,198
Oh, man.

39
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:48,804
Get in the car!

40
00:01:48,806 --> 00:01:50,004
Get in the car!

41
00:01:58,173 --> 00:01:59,371
Farooq!

42
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:03,137
- Farooq!
- Farooq!

44
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:39,087
Good day, Dr. Wells.

45
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:41,155
One can always hope, Gideon.

46
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:44,321
- Bring up my log, would you?
- Certainly.

47
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:45,988
Go ahead, doctor.

48
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,389
New entry.

49
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:50,426
It has now been 311 days
since lightning struck.

50
00:02:50,428 --> 00:02:54,995
Subject has begun relying
on his speed in everyday life,

51
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:59,692
using his extraordinary powers
to solve ordinary problems...

52
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:03,226
I'm late.

53
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:07,296
And accomplish ordinary tasks.

54
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:11,537
Unfortunately, his penchant
for the heroic persists.

55
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,238
I hate it when they let the new guy train

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,207
during the morning rush.

57
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,683
- Did you get one too?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:26,385
Wow.

59
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,255
The fact is...

60
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:30,523
Don't try nothing.

61
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:31,825
He can be a bit of a showoff.

62
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:34,361
Wallet. Now.

63
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:36,163
Oh, this is awesome.
You've got to be kidding me.

64
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:37,698
Hold on, okay? I'm just gonna...

65
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,067
I'm gonna set this down.

66
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,834
I mean, this is crazy.

67
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:42,201
There are literally hundreds of thousands

68
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:44,004
of people in Central City,

69
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:46,976
and out of everyone you could
have picked to rob, you pick me.

70
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,479
What, are you sick? Money, now.

71
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:51,984
I just... You're really gonna
be kicking yourself, man.

72
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:54,220
I mean, if there was
an Olympics for bad luck,

73
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:55,722
you didn't just medal, pal.

74
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:57,458
You Michael Phelps-ed.

75
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,824
I'll count to three.
Then I'm gonna shoot you.

76
00:03:59,826 --> 00:04:01,291
- One...
- Yeah.

77
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:03,126
Two.

78
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:11,809
And while his desire
to help others is commendable,

79
00:04:11,811 --> 00:04:14,778
it is impeding him
from realizing the full scope

80
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,512
of his abilities.

81
00:04:16,514 --> 00:04:21,146
But there's still time,

82
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:24,283
as the future remains intact.

83
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,989
Where's Barry? He's late.

84
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:33,791
Late is kind of his signature move.

85
00:04:33,793 --> 00:04:36,929
Hey, you guys want to
see my signature move?

86
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:41,998
Sorry, guys, I got a little held up.

87
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,034
You had to be there.

88
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,936
I'm gonna need a moment
or two alone with Barry.

89
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:56,573
Ooh, you're in trouble.

90
00:04:56,575 --> 00:04:59,747
Now, may I remind you,
Mr. Allen, we had an agreement.

91
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,548
We would help with your heroics out there

92
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,150
while you would help us
research and develop

93
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:06,386
your abilities in here, right?

94
00:05:06,388 --> 00:05:07,454
Yeah. No, I know.

95
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:09,123
I... I guess I've just

96
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,824
gotten a little caught up
with being able to help people,

97
00:05:10,826 --> 00:05:11,825
you know, put bad guys away.

98
00:05:11,827 --> 00:05:12,960
It feels good.

99
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:14,596
Imagine how good it will feel

100
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:17,098
to cure diseases, stop aging,
reverse paralysis.

101
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,032
All good causes.

102
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:21,098
So how can I help you do that?

103
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,368
You need more MRIs, more blood, or...

104
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,173
- I need more speed.
- Okay.

105
00:05:26,175 --> 00:05:28,507
Speed is the key to progress.

106
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:34,013
You need to kick it up a notch.

107
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:36,617
There was a homicide.

108
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:37,985
I'm sorry. I've got to go.

109
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:39,987
This is not just about you.

110
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:42,758
Remember that, Barry.

111
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,159
Yeah.

112
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:58,074
I hope you both skipped your breakfast.

113
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,543
Whoa.

114
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:01,478
What the hell could do that?

115
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,084
2,400 degrees, give or take.

116
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:07,089
This area's filled with combustibles.

117
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,856
How come nothing else burned up?

118
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,557
Where you going?

119
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:14,159
You see the soot on the ground
where the cement is burnt?

120
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:17,531
- Yeah.
- That's evidence of arc blasts.

121
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,264
Happens when high-amperage currents

122
00:06:19,266 --> 00:06:21,963
travel or arc through the air.

123
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:22,999
There's no live wires.

124
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:25,336
There's no utility poles.

125
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:27,436
So how was this guy electrocuted?

126
00:06:30,038 --> 00:06:32,640
Well, the first thing
we need to do is ID him.

127
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,940
Yeah.

128
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:35,940
His face is melted off.

129
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,409
How's that picture gonna help ID him?

130
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,976
I got mad skills.

131
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,112
Please don't ever say that again.

132
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:43,580
All right.

133
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,684
Hey, are you okay?

134
00:06:47,686 --> 00:06:49,185
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

135
00:06:49,187 --> 00:06:50,886
I don't know. You seem a little off.

136
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:57,627
- No, I'm fine.
- All right.

137
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:03,104
Facial recognition software...

138
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:04,972
it's designed for archeologists,

139
00:07:04,974 --> 00:07:07,506
and it should help us ID
your crispy corpse.

140
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:09,707
The question is, how did he
get fried in the first place?

141
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,443
Is there a metahuman out there
that can control electricity?

142
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:14,212
It'd take a serious electrostatic discharge

143
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,214
to cause that level of tissue damage.

144
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,915
Guys, according to the software,

145
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:21,786
there's an 82% chance
your victim looked like this.

146
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:23,321
82%?

147
00:07:23,323 --> 00:07:25,687
Hey, it was zero
when you walked in here, pal.

148
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,555
Can you cross-reference that
with the DMV database,

149
00:07:27,557 --> 00:07:28,790
maybe get a name?

150
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,157
Absolutely.

151
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,792
This software can do just about anything

152
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:33,729
now that Felicity reprogrammed it.

153
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:34,965
Casey Donahue.

154
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,733
No wife. No kids.

155
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,269
Used to work at the Petersburg
electrical substation.

156
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:41,641
- That can't be a coincidence.
- That's weird.

157
00:07:41,643 --> 00:07:44,775
Someone just used his ID
To enter the substation.

158
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:46,843
The Petersburg grid
is experiencing a power drain

159
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:48,278
right now.

160
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,313
Barry, be...

161
00:07:50,315 --> 00:07:51,813
Careful.

162
00:08:08,359 --> 00:08:11,359
I'm pretty sure this is a restricted area.

163
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:23,207
Easy there, Zappy.

164
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:25,980
I have to feed.

165
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:38,524
Whoa, what was that?

166
00:08:45,866 --> 00:08:48,367
More of that.

167
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,701
I need more.

168
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,272
Barry, what's happening?

169
00:09:08,822 --> 00:09:10,823
Too much.

170
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:12,326
Too much.

171
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:14,564
Get out of there.

172
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:20,306
Run, Barry.

173
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:25,710
I can't.

174
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:27,812
My speed...

175
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:29,980
is gone.

176
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:45,521
He runs slow even for a normal person.

177
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:48,025
You can't just lose your powers, okay?

178
00:09:48,027 --> 00:09:50,827
Your DNA was transformed by
the particle accelerator blast.

179
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:53,200
There's no way to untransform DNA.

180
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:55,267
Yeah, tell that to the uber driver

181
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,401
who charged me 65 bucks to take me here.

182
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:59,436
I had to tell her I was coming
from a cosplay party.

183
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:00,903
So we were wrong.

184
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:02,738
This metahuman doesn't electrocute people;

185
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,677
he siphons electricity,
thereby removing your power.

186
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,249
All right, do we think
this is temporary or...

187
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:13,853
we have to run tests.

188
00:10:13,855 --> 00:10:15,388
Yeah.

189
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,990
I've got to warn Joe.

190
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,659
Barry, we will find a way
to restore your speed.

191
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:24,861
I promise you that.

192
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,652
- You didn't catch it.
- I loved that mug.

193
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:45,254
And what part
of “a metahuman stole my speed”

194
00:10:45,256 --> 00:10:46,790
didn't you understand?

195
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,662
Barry, there's no part
of anything you can do

196
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:51,166
that I ever understand.

197
00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:52,667
What does Dr. Wells say?

198
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:54,103
He's working on it.

199
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:56,508
Barry, you have to get your speed back.

200
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,044
People in this city need protecting,

201
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,647
and if you don't get your speed,

202
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,416
how the hell are we gonna keep them safe?

203
00:11:02,418 --> 00:11:03,984
Joe, the meta who stole my speed,

204
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:06,419
he burned up the body
we saw in the alley today.

205
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,420
You need to tell the police
not to confront him.

206
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,822
- He's dangerous.
- Who's dangerous?

207
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:12,891
No one, just some thief.

208
00:11:12,893 --> 00:11:16,195
Well, criminals better watch out.

209
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,729
Cops in Central City
are the best there are,

210
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:20,498
and if you can't protect this city, dad,

211
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,002
I know The Flash will.

212
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:24,404
What if he can't?

213
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,807
What if he's gone?

214
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:28,177
Gone?

215
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:29,746
Yeah, or maybe he's just done,

216
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:31,949
or maybe it's like whatever
he could do before,

217
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:32,916
he can't do anymore.

218
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,118
- Huh?
- Barry?

219
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,722
Don't you have someplace to be?

220
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:38,193
Yeah, going.

221
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:44,437
Aw, Barry loved that mug.

222
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,097
That's a quality time piece, young man.

223
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:06,568
Oh, uh thanks.

224
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,570
They took mine,

225
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:10,504
all of them.

226
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:11,704
I guess you shouldn't have done

227
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:13,472
whatever it is you did.

228
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:20,210
Come on.

229
00:12:23,781 --> 00:12:25,083
Gideon, show me the future.

230
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:26,618
Certainly, doctor.

231
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:32,192
Run a complete search.

232
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:34,427
Show any references to The Flash.

233
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,926
Zero references to The Flash.

234
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:37,257
Look again.

235
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,525
Zero references.

236
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,359
Show any references to Barry Allen.

237
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:42,093
Zero references to Barry Allen.

238
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,561
Look again!

239
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:47,101
I've searched 3,452 times, Dr. Wells.

240
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:49,103
There's nothing.

241
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:57,744
You think I'll ever wear it again?

242
00:12:57,746 --> 00:13:01,346
I hope so.

243
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:05,554
I didn't have my speed for very long,

244
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:10,462
but now that it's gone, it feels
like part of me is gone too.

245
00:13:10,464 --> 00:13:15,070
With or without your speed,
you're still you, Barry.

246
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:17,006
But I'm not.

247
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:19,844
I'm not the best version of me.

248
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:22,180
I love being The Flash.

249
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,385
I love everything about it:

250
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:29,790
The feeling of running
hundreds of miles per hour,

251
00:13:29,792 --> 00:13:34,031
wind and power just rushing past my face,

252
00:13:34,033 --> 00:13:35,833
being able to help people.

253
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:41,369
I'm not sure I can
live without it, Caitlin.

254
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:45,870
- Farooq Gibran.
- Who?

255
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:48,071
The powers vampire who jacked your speed.

256
00:13:48,073 --> 00:13:49,372
I hacked into the surveillance footage

257
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:50,873
from the Petersburg substation.

258
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,741
Once I got his face,
it was easy to find a match.

259
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:54,110
He climbed an electrical tower

260
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:55,812
the night of the accelerator explosion.

261
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:57,981
No surprise where his powers came from.

262
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,990
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

263
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:07,394
This is not happening.

264
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,663
Dr. Harrison Wells,

265
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:10,131
I need to see you!

266
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,466
Come on, I know you're inside.

267
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:14,368
Open the door.

268
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,004
I just want to talk, Dr. Wells.

269
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:18,738
Wells!

270
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,240
Let me in!

271
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,878
Joe.

272
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,579
Hello, Iris.

273
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,550
I am out.

274
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:30,651
I need you to cover for me
until the shift change.

275
00:14:30,653 --> 00:14:31,718
Only one headline,

276
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,385
prison transfer, William Tockman.

277
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,742
Guns on the floor!

278
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:30,947
It should take you less than three seconds

279
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:34,353
to discard any thought
of rebellion and comply.

280
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:39,760
I take it I don't need to count out loud.

281
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,498
Hmm.

282
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,966
Striking resemblance.

283
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:06,482
He's inside.

284
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:18,473
Captain,

285
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:20,172
Tockman has at least ten hostages.

286
00:16:20,174 --> 00:16:24,109
Two officers down.

287
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:26,045
Copy that. When is the power back?

288
00:16:26,047 --> 00:16:27,482
We're on gennies for now.

289
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:31,450
- Not now.
- Wait.

290
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:33,288
Captain Singh,
I've been trying to get in touch

291
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,324
with Joe or anyone at the precinct.

292
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,827
There's a hostage situation, Barry,

293
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:39,828
and Joe's inside.

294
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,235
So's his daughter.

295
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,303
I'll call you when I know more.

296
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:45,939
Wait...

297
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:49,882
Joe and Iris are in trouble.

298
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,550
I need my powers back now.

299
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,583
I have a theory.

300
00:16:53,585 --> 00:16:54,752
It's untested.

301
00:16:54,754 --> 00:16:56,054
I'm willing to roll the dice.

302
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,190
Okay, you've lost your speed, yes,

303
00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:00,827
but nothing has changed
inside you on a subatomic level.

304
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,127
In other words,
your cells are still primed.

305
00:17:04,129 --> 00:17:05,661
They just need a jumpstart.

306
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:07,264
Okay, how do we do that?
How do we jumpstart me?

307
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,233
We need to replicate
the initial jolt to your system.

308
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,435
But that would mean a peak current

309
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:13,304
of at least 20,000 kilo-amps.

310
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:14,972
Are you insane?

311
00:17:14,974 --> 00:17:16,538
That's more electricity than
they give to people

312
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,839
in the electric chair.

313
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:19,405
Caitlin, with Farooq in the building,

314
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:20,974
we're all looking at a death sentence here.

315
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:22,376
The spare generator's offline.

316
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:24,512
If we reboot it,
we could get a charge that big.

317
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:26,448
We need something
that can transmit the load

318
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,151
from the generator to Barry's body

319
00:17:28,153 --> 00:17:29,487
without shorting out.

320
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:30,555
The treadmill.

321
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,056
My baby could take the charge.

322
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,591
What if Barry can't?

323
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:35,125
Well, that's up to Mr. Allen.

324
00:17:36,659 --> 00:17:38,128
Where are you going?

325
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:41,565
I'm gonna talk to him.

326
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:43,100
No. No.

327
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:45,770
Okay, you didn't see him at the substation.

328
00:17:45,772 --> 00:17:47,574
He needed to feed.

329
00:17:47,576 --> 00:17:50,175
I got super speed out of
the particle accelerator blast,

330
00:17:50,177 --> 00:17:51,443
but his best friends died.

331
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,013
He woke up with a disease.

332
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:55,217
Earlier today, you worked a crime scene

333
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:57,786
where this metahuman
electrocuted an innocent man.

334
00:17:57,788 --> 00:17:59,320
He's a murderer!

335
00:17:59,322 --> 00:18:03,559
And you are powerless
to defend yourself against him.

336
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,425
He may just need help like I did.

337
00:18:05,427 --> 00:18:07,793
I don't need my powers to offer him that.

338
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,493
I have to try.

339
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:15,531
Tockman?

340
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,300
Tockman.

341
00:18:17,302 --> 00:18:18,335
Tockman!

342
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,670
I am presently in control

343
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:22,606
of eight of Central City's finest,

344
00:18:22,608 --> 00:18:24,108
three underpaid assistants,

345
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,376
and one very brave civilian girl.

346
00:18:26,378 --> 00:18:28,078
You've got demands; I want to hear them.

347
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,715
But first let the civilians go.

348
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:34,553
Would you prefer
I sent them out alive or dead?

349
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:36,089
Please be more specific.

350
00:18:36,091 --> 00:18:39,793
One helicopter,
one vegetarian takeout meal,

351
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:42,761
one laptop with eight gigabytes of RAM

352
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:46,836
will be delivered on this roof
at exactly 53 minutes

353
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:49,205
and 27 seconds from now,

354
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:51,873
or I shoot a hostage.

355
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,043
There is a citywide blackout.

356
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,778
I'm gonna need more time.

357
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,250
Captain, you may delay, but time will not.

358
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:02,921
Benjamin Franklin.

359
00:19:02,923 --> 00:19:05,057
Very good, detective.

360
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,063
Hey, whoa, whoa.

361
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:12,698
Whoa, whoa, easy.

362
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,534
I'm not gonna hurt you.

363
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:17,438
You can't hurt me.

364
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,577
Where is Harrison Wells?

365
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:21,645
Look, I know what happened to you.

366
00:19:21,647 --> 00:19:24,483
The night of the accelerator
explosion, it changed you.

367
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:27,120
It changed me too.

368
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:33,793
You were the one in the red suit.

369
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:35,930
I fed from you.

370
00:19:35,932 --> 00:19:37,400
I have to keep feeding.

371
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:40,333
All right, I know
this has to be terrifying.

372
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:44,338
That's why I want to help you, okay?

373
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,107
The night of the explosion,
when the light hit me,

374
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,410
it stopped my heart.

375
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,078
Jake and Darya...

376
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,477
they were your friends.

377
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:55,479
I woke up, and they were beside me, dead.

378
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:56,913
They tried to give me CPR.

379
00:19:56,915 --> 00:20:01,251
They were touching me,
and I electrocuted them.

380
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:05,622
This is not your fault.

381
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,859
I know.

382
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:14,999
Wells did this to me.

383
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,174
Farooq, you need to listen to me.

384
00:20:30,888 --> 00:20:32,486
Not sure how long that will hold.

385
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:34,655
Done being noble, Mr. Allen?

386
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:37,025
Caitlin, get him to the treadmill.

387
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,828
Cisco, bring the generator online.

388
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,595
Make sure Barry gets the charge.

389
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:44,462
What? You're not coming with me?

390
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:46,562
I am not leaving you.

391
00:20:46,564 --> 00:20:48,397
Listen to me.

392
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:50,498
Of everything I've done in my life,

393
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,866
of everything I have invented,

394
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:55,003
my most important creation is The Flash.

395
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:57,504
Barry Allen must have a future.

396
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,206
Now, go.

397
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:01,244
Go!

398
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,752
End this now, and I'll talk to the D.A.

399
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:15,458
It was your district attorney
that denied me furlough

400
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,862
so I could visit my dying sister
one last time,

401
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,867
say goodbye to her in person.

402
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:25,934
That's time I'll never get back!

403
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,372
So however long I have in this life,

404
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:38,710
I promise not one second more
will be spent in a prison cell.

405
00:21:39,747 --> 00:21:40,713
Got him.

406
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:41,747
Eddie!

407
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,121
Eddie. Eddie, Eddie.

408
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:52,323
An officer was just shot 9.2 seconds ago.

409
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:56,228
I'd pick up the pace in meeting
my demands, Captain.

410
00:22:03,536 --> 00:22:05,236
I'm not healing fast anymore.

411
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:10,277
- That's unfortunate.
- Don't worry.

412
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,379
When Dr. Wells has a theory,
he's usually right.

413
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:16,418
What if something happens
to Joe and Iris first?

414
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:49,286
Come to check on your pet?

415
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:51,287
Why don't you just kill me, huh?

416
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:54,425
Get it over with.

417
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:57,092
Quid pro quo.

418
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:59,161
That's Latin, Mr. Woodward.

419
00:22:59,163 --> 00:23:00,562
You've heard of Latin?

420
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:02,463
Quid pro quo means something for something,

421
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:06,000
and in this case
that something is your freedom.

422
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:08,802
I'm prepared to grant it to you.

423
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,175
How do you know I won't kill you?

424
00:23:12,177 --> 00:23:13,676
Let's call that a calculated risk,

425
00:23:13,678 --> 00:23:14,811
one I'm willing to take.

426
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:16,645
- Really?
- That's right.

427
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:17,912
Why would you do that?

428
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:20,617
Because there is another metahuman

429
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:22,885
loose in this facility.

430
00:23:25,688 --> 00:23:27,355
I want you to kill him.

431
00:23:54,185 --> 00:23:57,521
Did you know the human body
generates electricity?

432
00:23:57,523 --> 00:24:01,758
The average person gives off 342 watts,

433
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,658
and I can smell it coming from you.

434
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:31,152
- Turn on the treadmill.
- You're still hurt.

435
00:24:31,154 --> 00:24:33,319
We don't have time!

436
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:45,163
Been dying to punch somebody.

437
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:58,743
Ouch.

438
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:00,478
- Caitlin!
- I can't.

439
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,914
We don't have a choice.

440
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,782
If I turn this on, it could kill you.

441
00:25:03,784 --> 00:25:05,416
If you don't, we could all die.

442
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:07,753
I already lost someone
I cared about in this building.

443
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,222
I can't do it again.

444
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:14,658
Listen, someone once told me

445
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,027
that I was struck by that
lightning for a reason,

446
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:19,331
that it chose me.

447
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:21,634
I'm not sure I believe it.

448
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:24,172
Right now, it doesn't matter
what I believe.

449
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:30,349
What do you believe?

450
00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:40,363
Come on.

451
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,316
My God, are you okay?

452
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,184
Did you feel anything?

453
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:05,061
It didn't work.

454
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:11,833
Please, he's bleeding.

455
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:13,602
You have to let us get him some help.

456
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,339
You'll stay where you are.

457
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,474
And while you're killing time,
he's bleeding out.

458
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:22,081
As if you could kill time
without wounding eternity.

459
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,518
Henry David Thoreau.

460
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,621
Ooh, good.

461
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,737
A little battlefield trick.

462
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:36,540
Eddie.

463
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:45,245
If he lives long enough
to receive medical treatment,

464
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:48,742
they'll know the exact time
the tourniquet was applied.

465
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:52,948
What? No “thank you”?

466
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,715
They call you the clock king, right?

467
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:58,047
A somewhat florid appellation,

468
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,583
but I've grown to see the humor in it.

469
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,051
You're going back to prison.

470
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,851
Really?

471
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:05,552
And... And how do you reckon?

472
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,554
Because The Flash is coming.

473
00:27:07,556 --> 00:27:08,756
Oh.

474
00:27:10,723 --> 00:27:13,593
Oh, where are you?

475
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,567
Tony.

476
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,002
Hey, Tony, what are you doing?

477
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:28,841
Oh, come on. You know me, Allen.

478
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,844
I never run from a fight.

479
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:33,679
All right, well, stay with me, okay?

480
00:27:33,681 --> 00:27:37,047
You're good.

481
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:39,249
Run.

482
00:27:39,251 --> 00:27:40,616
What?

483
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:43,383
Hey, Tony.

484
00:27:47,423 --> 00:27:49,660
No.

485
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:51,229
Barry.

486
00:28:00,242 --> 00:28:01,976
Early.

487
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,519
You ever seen the city
at night by helicopter?

488
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,288
It's quite spectacular.

489
00:28:16,602 --> 00:28:18,571
You're winded. That's not good.

490
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:21,011
I need to take your blood
and figure out what happened.

491
00:28:22,248 --> 00:28:24,351
I can't believe he's dead.

492
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:26,121
Dr. Wells?

493
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:28,793
No, no. Tony woodward.

494
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:30,195
He escaped from the pipeline.

495
00:28:30,197 --> 00:28:32,031
He must have got out when the blackout hit.

496
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:33,635
Not possible.

497
00:28:33,637 --> 00:28:35,539
The pipeline was designed
to withstand a power outage.

498
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:36,907
Someone had to have let him go.

499
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:40,645
I did.

500
00:28:40,647 --> 00:28:43,114
I released him.

501
00:28:43,116 --> 00:28:44,449
Why?

502
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:45,917
To divert our intruder's attention

503
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,685
while we worked to restore your speed.

504
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:49,352
You used him as a distraction?

505
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,853
An unnecessary one, as it turns out.

506
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,723
It seems the plan has failed.

507
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:56,026
I...

508
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,799
I have his blood on me.

509
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,302
How could you do that?

510
00:29:03,304 --> 00:29:05,071
You're showing a lot of sentiment for a man

511
00:29:05,073 --> 00:29:06,503
who tormented you as a child.

512
00:29:06,505 --> 00:29:08,237
Tony might have been a bully then and now,

513
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,941
but he didn't deserve to die.

514
00:29:09,943 --> 00:29:13,012
Does Caitlin or Cisco or me

515
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:14,147
or you?

516
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,983
I had a choice to make, him or us.

517
00:29:15,985 --> 00:29:17,918
I chose us without a second thought.

518
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,419
Well, all your talk about miracle cures

519
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:21,754
and scientific breakthroughs,

520
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:24,290
but you don't care about people at all.

521
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:25,659
Well, maybe you care too much, Barry.

522
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:27,194
I know being a hero is important to you,

523
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:28,695
and I respect your ideals.

524
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:30,763
I just don't have the
luxury of sharing them.

525
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:31,898
I forgot.

526
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,099
Your game's chess.

527
00:29:34,101 --> 00:29:38,271
We're all just pawns to you, right?

528
00:29:38,273 --> 00:29:41,474
So what's your move, doctor?

529
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:43,810
Which one of us gets sacrificed next?

530
00:30:01,075 --> 00:30:02,509
We have to get out of the facility.

531
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,179
We just left him on D level.

532
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:06,684
We'll never make it
to the main entrance from here.

533
00:30:06,686 --> 00:30:09,286
What about the garage, the mobile lab van?

534
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:10,855
It's my move, Mr. Allen,

535
00:30:10,857 --> 00:30:13,127
and I say we make a run for it.

536
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:14,796
Oh, my God. Barry, look.

537
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,832
Your cells, they're rapidly regenerating.

538
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,440
I still don't have my speed.

539
00:30:24,442 --> 00:30:28,508
It must be mental, not physical.

540
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,612
Oh, you have the yips.

541
00:30:31,614 --> 00:30:33,513
- The whats?
- You know.

542
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:35,648
When a second baseman all of
a sudden can't throw to first

543
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,251
or a golfer tries to putt

544
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,284
and they get all embarrassed and upset,

545
00:30:39,286 --> 00:30:40,385
and then that makes the yips worse,

546
00:30:40,387 --> 00:30:41,853
and it's a hot mess,

547
00:30:41,855 --> 00:30:43,923
and then they feel
like even more of a failure.

548
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,623
That's not helping.

549
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:50,093
Look, you asked if I believed

550
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:52,062
you were struck by lightning for a reason,

551
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:54,064
if you were chosen.

552
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:55,433
I believe.

553
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:57,135
You should too.

554
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,542
Let's move.

555
00:31:05,912 --> 00:31:07,144
Tockman, no.

556
00:31:07,146 --> 00:31:08,512
No, don't do this, not her.

557
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:10,081
No, take me, please.

558
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,549
Something tells me you
will not be a docile passenger.

559
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:14,817
- She will.
- Dad. Dad.

560
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:17,987
Wait, wait! Let her say goodbye.

561
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:21,760
This is her boyfriend lying here dying,

562
00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:26,530
and I think you and me both know
that he probably won't make it.

563
00:31:26,532 --> 00:31:28,767
It's wrong that you didn't get
to say goodbye to your sister.

564
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:30,636
Give them what you deserved.

565
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:37,343
You have 20 seconds.

566
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,580
Eddie. Eddie.

567
00:31:41,582 --> 00:31:42,914
Sorry, babe.

568
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,481
No, please.

569
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:46,582
You have to hang on for me, okay?

570
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:48,350
I'm gonna be right back.

571
00:32:05,575 --> 00:32:07,607
Let's go.

572
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:15,619
Second van, keys are inside.

573
00:32:15,621 --> 00:32:18,622
Come on.

574
00:32:19,625 --> 00:32:21,661
Get in! Come on!

575
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:33,138
Come on.

576
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,141
He's here.

577
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:46,854
Barry.

578
00:32:46,856 --> 00:32:48,487
Quickly.

579
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,855
Time and tide wait for no man.

580
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:55,895
Wait, let her say goodbye.

581
00:32:55,897 --> 00:32:57,497
You have 20 seconds.

582
00:32:57,499 --> 00:32:59,834
Ankle holster.

583
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,479
Iris!

584
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:09,447
Oh, my God, are you okay?

585
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:10,682
I'm okay. Come on.

586
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:13,053
- Did he hit you?
- I'm okay.

587
00:33:13,055 --> 00:33:14,322
Guys.

588
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:15,991
Oh, my God.

589
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,258
Oh, my God. No, please.

590
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,458
Hey!

591
00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:22,596
You're here for me.

592
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:27,599
Finally you show your face.

593
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:31,237
Well, I wasn't exactly eager to be killed.

594
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:34,173
Neither were my friends.

595
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:35,541
I know.

596
00:33:35,543 --> 00:33:37,076
I hurt a lot of people that night.

597
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:38,279
People?

598
00:33:38,281 --> 00:33:40,082
You don't even know their names.

599
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:42,518
Jake Davenport.

600
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,022
Darya Kim.

601
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:47,259
Ralph Dibny, Al Rothstein,

602
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:49,796
Grant Emerson, Will Everett,

603
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:54,102
Bea Da Costa, Ronnie Raymond.

604
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:57,937
I know the names of every person
who died that night.

605
00:33:57,939 --> 00:33:59,707
I know they all mattered,

606
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:02,474
and the fact that the world is
now deprived of their potential

607
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,507
is something that I have to
live with every day,

608
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,811
but these people... These people
have done nothing wrong.

609
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:09,111
You want to punish me?

610
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:13,144
Fine, let's do that,

611
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:14,845
but let these people live.

612
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:21,486
You died that night too.

613
00:34:23,825 --> 00:34:25,493
No!

614
00:34:25,495 --> 00:34:27,862
You just didn't know it till today.

615
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:34,437
Iris.

616
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:21,827
We could have called him “Blackout.”

617
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:24,064
He had a name, Cisco.

618
00:36:24,066 --> 00:36:25,833
I'm just not sure what happened.

619
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:29,837
Why didn't he just siphon
all my powers like before?

620
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,142
Because you finally stopped
thinking about your powers

621
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:34,976
and just connected to them.

622
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:36,944
Look, this is a sample of your blood

623
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,948
from just after you
were struck by lightning.

624
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,722
Now your cells are generating
more energy than ever before.

625
00:36:43,724 --> 00:36:47,826
It was more energy than the
meta could safely handle.

626
00:36:47,828 --> 00:36:49,660
It's almost like he choked on you.

627
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:51,494
But what does that mean?

628
00:36:51,496 --> 00:36:54,231
It means you've kicked it up a notch.

629
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:06,008
Dr. Wells.

630
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,012
What I said about how you don't
care about people, I...

631
00:37:10,014 --> 00:37:13,448
No, look, Barry.

632
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:19,417
There is a reason that
my biography describes me

633
00:37:19,419 --> 00:37:24,494
as arrogant, prickly, brusque...

634
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:26,328
“at times contemptuous.”

635
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:29,130
- I read it twice.
- You were right.

636
00:37:29,132 --> 00:37:30,765
I don't care much for people, Barry.

637
00:37:30,767 --> 00:37:33,735
I find them misinformed, shortsighted.

638
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:34,870
So why do you do what you do?

639
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:36,206
Why get up in the morning?

640
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:38,411
Because I believe in a better future,

641
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,378
one that I very much want to see,

642
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,079
one that you are a part of.

643
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,652
I might not much care for people, Barry,

644
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:48,853
but I care about you.

645
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:59,130
Trauma team to the NICU.
Trauma team to the NICU.

646
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:03,334
Hey, Allen.

647
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:04,468
Hey, Eddie.

648
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,436
Flowers.

649
00:38:06,438 --> 00:38:10,141
That's so nice.

650
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:12,076
Where were you all night?

651
00:38:12,078 --> 00:38:15,643
Home, trying to eat all
the ice cream before it melted.

652
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:18,045
I love ice cream.

653
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,548
He is on pain meds, lots of them,

654
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,119
but he's gonna be okay.

655
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:24,318
It's been some night.

656
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,687
I am gonna get some coffee.

657
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:26,990
I'll be back.

658
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:33,163
Dude.

659
00:38:37,171 --> 00:38:38,872
Awesome.

660
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:40,842
I guess you're feeling better.

661
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:43,581
Oh, yeah.

662
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:44,850
Did you guys see that?

663
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:50,656
You're just high, partner.

664
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:53,260
Right, I forgot.

665
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,269
Oh, now you show up.

666
00:39:02,271 --> 00:39:04,506
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you today.

667
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,978
- It couldn't be helped.
- It's okay.

668
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,982
A girl's got to be her own hero
every now and again.

669
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:14,017
I promise I'll never be late again.

670
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,686
My best friend is always saying that,

671
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:17,853
and he is always late.

672
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:22,855
You're worth being on time for.

673
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,107
Honey, you all right?

674
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:35,778
Yeah, why?

675
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,648
You forgot your coffee.

676
00:39:39,684 --> 00:39:41,718
Oh, uh...

677
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:49,030
Good day, Dr. Wells.

678
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,533
Yes, it is, Gideon.

679
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:52,369
Bring up my log, please, new entry.

680
00:39:52,371 --> 00:39:56,475
It has now been 312 days
since lightning struck.

681
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,511
In the past 24 hours,

682
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:00,849
subject has taken a great leap forward,

683
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:04,886
causing me to revise my initial thesis.

684
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:09,060
I thought... Well, I thought
his attachment to people

685
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:12,596
was a distraction
slowing down his progress.

686
00:40:12,598 --> 00:40:15,768
Now I realize the opposite is true.

687
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:21,343
Barry's attachment to people,
the people he cares about,

688
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:25,381
is actually the key
to getting him up to speed.

689
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:29,050
In the meantime, good news.

690
00:40:30,984 --> 00:40:33,186
The future remains intact.

691
00:40:37,025 --> 00:40:38,789
You're early.

692
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:39,990
Yeah, I know.

693
00:40:39,992 --> 00:40:41,994
It feels weird to me too.

694
00:40:41,996 --> 00:40:45,733
I thought after yesterday,
you'd want to sleep in.

695
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,502
Can't. There's too much work to do.

696
00:40:48,504 --> 00:40:50,205
I'm ready to do it.

697
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:51,840
I want to push myself,

698
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:54,943
find out how fast I can really go.

699
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:56,812
You were right.

700
00:40:56,814 --> 00:41:00,015
This is not just about me.

701
00:41:00,017 --> 00:41:01,984
Let's get to work.

702
00:41:41,429 --> 00:41:43,228
Now, you...

703
00:41:45,663 --> 00:41:49,129
Had the ability
to steal The Flash's powers,

704
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,030
and I...

705
00:41:56,937 --> 00:42:01,908
Would love to know...

706
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,475
How you did that.
