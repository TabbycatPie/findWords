15
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:03,370
My name is Barry Allen,

16
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,380
and I am the fastest man alive.

17
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,250
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

18
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,010
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

19
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,920
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

20
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,020
After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse,

21
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,600
I ran back in time and created

22
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,690
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

23
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,400
I restored the timeline to how it was,

24
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,560
only to find things weren't as I left them.

25
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,720
I brought new threats to our world,

26
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,130
and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.

27
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,250
I am The Flash.

28
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,460
Previously on "The Flash"...

29
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,460
Caitlin, I'm sorry, honey.

30
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,350
These powers you have-- the more you use them,

31
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,840
the more difficult they're going to be to reverse.

32
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:41,880
I took your cuffs.

33
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,270
Is this some sort of fashion choice?

34
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,930
'Cause you're not a meta-human.

35
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,210
- Am I her? - Yeah.

36
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,550
I saw the both of us.

37
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,920
Like, full-on Vibe versus Killer Frost.

38
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,580
The time has come

39
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,040
to set you free.

40
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,200
Wally, don't!

41
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,500
You may serve the speed force, Flash,

42
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,810
but I rule it.

43
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,930
You are only a man,

44
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,280
but I am a god.

45
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,480
Your god.

46
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,360
I am Savitar.

47
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,070
- Shoot him! - I can't see it.

48
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,240
Just do it!

49
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,300
Alchemy!

50
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,100
Let's go for a run.

51
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,630
Barry!

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,530
- What's happening? - I don't understand.

54
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,150
The suit's tracker must be malfunctioning.

55
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,600
It says he's appearing and reappearing

56
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,740
all over the city at once, and that's impossible.

57
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,250
He can't be moving that fast.

58
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,300
Well, if he can't,

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,080
maybe something else can.

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,270
Had enough?

61
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,720
Not even close.

62
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,940
Look. It stopped. He's at the waterfront.

63
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,420
Okay. We have to get to him.

64
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,990
And do what? He's fighting an invisible force

65
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,430
that's too fast to track.

66
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,150
- If I may, I have a plan. - No. No.

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,920
- Pretty good plan. - Put your hand down.

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,390
It's a question of numbers. 'Cause right now,

69
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,810
it seems to be one against one.

70
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,870
What if there were three against one?

71
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,700
Do you know what I'm saying?

72
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,920
Cisco, you can open a breach

73
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,290
and get you both to the waterfront.

74
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,420
Guys, I can't. It's too dangerous.

75
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,850
I'm begging you. Please.

76
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,530
Still alive down there?

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,230
You are only a shadow beneath my throne.

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,860
You are the past,

79
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,450
whereas I--

80
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,800
I am the future Flash.

81
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,290
I can't see it!

82
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,170
Just do it!

83
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,680
Oh, boy.

84
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,910
I'm gonna feel that tomorrow.

85
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,040
That was a new and painful use of my powers.

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,610
You okay?

87
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,720
Yeah, I'm okay.

88
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,710
Just cold.

89
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,630
Thanks for coming.

92
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,480
Barry, you're already healing.

93
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,020
You should be fine soon.

94
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,670
Cisco, the MRI I did of your brain shows

95
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,080
changes in the capillary morphology

96
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,610
similar to that of a mini-stroke.

97
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,630
I wouldn't try an intra-dimensional breach

98
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,770
like that anytime soon.

99
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,090
Okay, okay. Mini-stroke?

100
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,060
You can't just gloss over that like that.

101
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,210
Okay? What does that-- what does that mean?

102
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,000
Am I gonna have this migraine for the rest of my life?

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,940
It means you should take a few aspirin and you'll be fine.

104
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,640
Well, just lead with that next time.

105
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,940
Cait, I know what a risk you took using your powers.

106
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
Thank you.

107
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,310
I didn't do anything.

108
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,330
Well, you saved my life.

109
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,400
You've saved mine plenty of times.

110
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,060
I'm gonna go check on Wally.

111
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,600
Okay.

112
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,340
What was that?

113
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,580
That frozen thing at the waterfront?

114
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,380
I don't know.

115
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,070
But now we know Alchemy is just the lackey.

116
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,450
Whatever that thing was, it's what we're really up against.

117
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,170
Question: you're the only one who can see him?

118
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,660
Why? I mean...why?

119
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,730
You're both speedsters.

120
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,940
Maybe it has something to do with that.

121
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,380
Maybe. But I think he's more than a speedster.

122
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,190
I mean, when he had me,

123
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,480
it wasn't like we were even moving;

124
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,230
it was just like,

125
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,780
"Bam," we were instantly somewhere different,

126
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,280
even from my perspective.

127
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,660
Did he say anything else?

128
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,360
He said his name was Savitar.

129
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,850
Hindu god of motion.

130
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,740
What? How do you know that?

131
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,320
Crossword puzzle wizard. On two planets, I might add.

132
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,980
12 across, 7 letters. Savitar. Bam.

133
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,780
Hindu god of motion.

134
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,840
- He said he was God. - That's-- that's nice.

135
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,670
That's not scary... at all.

136
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,440
- You sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm okay.

137
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,440
How are you?

138
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,980
Can you tell anything?

139
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,450
Wally's alive in there,

140
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,800
but his vitals are really subdued.

141
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,420
His brain function is low.

142
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,660
Something like you'd see in a coma patient.

143
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,570
I was in a coma after I got my powers.

144
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,670
Maybe it's a similar process.

145
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,830
Can we take him out?

146
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,650
When a caterpillar is in its chrysalis,

147
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,630
it literally breaks its body down into enzyme soup

148
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,590
before rebuilding as a butterfly.

149
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,160
If this cocoon is doing the same thing to Wally,

150
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,430
I just-- I don't know.

151
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,330
You're right. You don't know.

152
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,240
None of us knows a damn thing about what's going on in there.

153
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,240
And I feel like a fool just standing here listening.

154
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,080
- Dad? - Look, I've said it before:

155
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,290
I don't have the education most of you had.

156
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,760
The science of what we do here is mostly lost on me.

157
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,820
But what I do have is my detective skills

158
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,550
and my instinct,

159
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,550
and time and time again,

160
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,250
I don't use them

161
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,850
because you guys all tell me

162
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,430
that everything is gonna be okay.

163
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,670
Everything is not okay.

164
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,940
I'm sorry, Joe.

165
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,040
I know you are.

166
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,490
But I can't just stand here.

167
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,920
My gut is telling me I need to do something.

168
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,060
This is not your fault.

169
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,130
Yeah, it is.

171
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,920
Not so tough without your friends and your fancy robe.

172
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,950
I want to know about Alchemy.

173
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,630
What he does, how he does it--

174
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,350
His powers are beyond human understanding.

175
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,560
- Try me. - Oh, you will be tried.

176
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,230
All of you.

177
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,620
When my master rises, the human race will be judged.

178
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:39,690
From where I'm sitting, you will not fare very well.

179
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,480
You think I'm playing with you?

180
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,480
My son is in one of those cocoons,

181
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,190
and you're gonna tell me how to get him out.

182
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,300
Now talk!

183
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,250
Go away!

184
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,970
Caitlin, what is it?

185
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,170
It's Wally.

186
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,900
He's out of that thing. He's fine.

187
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,000
- And he's okay? - Yeah. He's fine.

188
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,050
I promise.

189
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,050
Thank God. Thank you, Caitlin.

190
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,530
You should probably go see him.

191
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,750
Yeah.

192
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,270
Where is Alchemy?

193
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,630
Tell me where Alchemy is.

194
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
I sense great fear in you.

195
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,160
You fear your power,

196
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,640
your own greatness.

197
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,290
I don't fear anything anymore.

198
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,830
Where is Alchemy?

199
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,040
The only one I fear is that whom Alchemy serves,

200
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
the dark lord Savitar.

201
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,820
Maybe it's time you started fearing me.

202
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,400
No, no, no--aah!

203
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,590
Who's in there?

204
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,910
Frozen?

205
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,280
Hello?

206
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,500
Excuse me?

207
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,530
Hey! Anybody out there?

208
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,800
Let us out of here!

209
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,170
I need you to come with me.

210
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,590
Wait. What is going on?

211
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,450
- Hey, Joe. - What do you mean?

212
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,340
Caitlin came by the precinct. She said that Wally was out

213
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,520
and that he was okay.

214
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,310
What? I didn't even see her leave.

215
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,140
SWAT needs to establish a cordon at 6th and Fairmont

216
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,110
all the way down to Gleason.

217
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:22,130
Move. Move! Let's go!

218
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,100
Detective Patterson? Hey. What's--

219
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,310
Just the man I want to see.

220
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,440
Your little friend's in big trouble, Allen.

221
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,470
- My frien... - A female meta-human

222
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,930
attacked the precinct, took Julian Albert hostage.

223
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,940
Julian? Wait, do you know who the meta is?

224
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,690
No. But she's smart. I'll tell you that.

225
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,520
Took out our security cameras so we couldn't ID her.

226
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,130
I thought maybe you'd recognize her.

227
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
No. Why would she take Julian?

228
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,640
She's a meta. They're all crazy.

229
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,520
But don't worry. We'll get her.

230
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,330
What are you doing?

231
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,150
What are you doing, Cait?

232
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,900
Bit chilly in here, isn't it?

233
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,710
Shut up. I need to think.

234
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,680
Look. I know who you are, okay?

235
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,670
You're--you're-you're Allen's friend, right?

236
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,600
Dr. Snow?

237
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,130
I said be quiet.

238
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,660
Are you going to kill me?

239
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,610
- I need to find Alchemy. - Alchemy? What?

240
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,760
What do you want me to do?

241
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Alchemy has disciples, followers.

242
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,930
I need you to create an algorithm

243
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,370
that will allow you to locate anyone

244
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,900
who has searched for a specific keyword

245
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,300
in the last six months.

246
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,240
If we find one of his followers,

247
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,720
they can take me to Alchemy.

248
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,970
Okay. But "Alchemy" is a relatively common phrase.

249
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,290
It'll have hundreds of hits.

250
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,870
Then search for an uncommon one.

251
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,810
- Such as? - Savitar.

252
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,910
Savitar?

253
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,310
Get searching.

254
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,330
So, they don't know why she took Julian?

255
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,920
No, they don't. But more importantly,

256
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,580
they don't even know that it's Caitlin yet,

257
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,680
so we need to find her before they do.

258
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,340
Savitar. Now, what about this Savitar--

259
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,230
We find Caitlin. Then we can worry about Savitar.

260
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,970
You know what, guys? I'm--I agree with Barry.

261
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,180
Let's find Caitlin.

262
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,340
Okay. You're right.

263
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,640
And when we find Caitlin, then what?

264
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,810
I don't know. I mean, she's not thinking straight. She's--

265
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,250
She's becoming Killer Frost.

266
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,250
It's just like in the Vibe.

267
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,240
We don't know that yet.

268
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,190
Her mother said the more that she uses her powers,

269
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,440
the faster she's gonna go.

270
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,760
And saving you from Savitar--

271
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,160
that must have put her over the edge.

272
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,360
How do we find her?

273
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,790
I don't know. I tried pinging her cell and Julian's,

274
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,260
but she must have ditched them both.

275
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,650
If I may proffer a notion...

276
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,730
Oh, great. More suggestions from the genius over here.

277
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,690
You don't call the genius. The genius calls you.

278
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,630
Question: how did you catch your Captain Cold?

279
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,320
I've been reading about him in your files.

280
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,260
Seems like a wily fellow. Slow talker.

281
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,680
But his MO--strikingly similar to our dear Caitlin's.

282
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,140
What? No. We tracked him using the satellite

283
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,300
to scan for ultraviolet cold signatures.

284
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,970
Got it.

285
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,380
No. Nothing near the precinct.

286
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,710
Wait, what's that?

288
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,700
Frozen food warehouse.

289
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,930
There she is.

290
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,410
Okay, I'm gonna isolate the feed so that no one else can see it.

291
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,330
All right, figure out what she's making Julian do.

292
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,880
- I¡¯m going. - Okay.

293
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,940
That...is cool.

294
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,900
I found two individuals that have searched for the name Savitar.

295
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,330
Here are both their addresses,

296
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,760
both of them in Central City.

297
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,030
What exactly are you gonna do to them?

298
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,770
I don't know.

299
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,070
What am I doing?

301
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,280
Son of a--

302
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,590
Sergeant, we got a location on Albert.

303
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,610
Let's move.

304
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,780
What part of "I'll freeze you to death"

305
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,590
did you not understand?

306
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,380
Stop.

307
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,550
- Get out of here. - You know I can't.

308
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,440
What are you doing? Take her out. Take her out.

309
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,750
You don't want to do this. You don't want to hurt anybody.

310
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,470
She's willing to hurt someone. Knock her out.

311
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,570
- Caitlin-- - Leave me alone.

312
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,460
- What are you doing? - I have to find Alchemy.

313
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,050
We will find him. All right? Together.

314
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,990
No. You don't understand. I don't want to lock him up.

315
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
- I need him to help me. - Help you what?

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,040
I need him to get rid of my powers.

317
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,360
Oh, Caitlin.

318
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,030
I don't know if it works that way.

319
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,430
You don't know that it doesn't.

320
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,360
I know that we love you.

321
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,840
And we will do everything that we can to help you.

322
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,720
You and I--we've been through too much together

323
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,250
to let each other down now.

324
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,860
Please. Let me help you.

325
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,960
Like you helped your mother?

326
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,440
Caitlin.

327
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,500
Or Wally? Or me?

328
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,180
You keep messing with everyone's lives,

329
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,140
wrecking everything, and we're left behind

330
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,470
to pick up the pieces from your mistakes.

331
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,420
Some things you break can't be put back together.

332
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,190
I can fix this.

333
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,440
Oh, like you fixed Cisco's family?

334
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,840
You didn't tell Cisco that you screwed him worst of all, did you?

335
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
You hear that, Cisco?

336
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,380
Dante was alive,

337
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,790
healthy and happy,

338
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,370
until Barry created Flashpoint.

339
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,570
When he reset things, that's what killed him.

340
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,660
Barry is the reason your brother is dead.

341
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,840
Albert's down. Shoot her!

342
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,140
That severed your triceps surae.

343
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,480
Even with your healing abilities,

344
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,200
it'll take four hours to regenerate.

345
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,830
Don't follow me.

346
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,570
Caitlin. Come on--gah!

347
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,680
- How much does it hurt? - As much as I deserve.

348
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,760
Okay. Let me know.

349
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,330
They took Julian to County General.

350
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:17,490
He's still out cold. How hard did you hit him?

351
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,650
I don't know. I didn't mean to knock him out.

352
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,560
Or maybe I did.

353
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,810
Cisco.

354
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,390
Hey, man, um,

355
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
what Caitlin said--

356
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,550
Was she lying?

357
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,990
No. Um--

358
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,860
You're sorry?

359
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,770
That you killed my brother?

360
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,630
'Cause he was here.

361
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,170
He was alive...

362
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,300
until you created Flashpoint, until you did this.

363
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,350
I know, man.

364
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,780
I don't even know how to feel right now.

365
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:02,170
All I know is Caitlin is out there,

366
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,420
and we need to find her.

367
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,920
Can we do that?

368
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,830
Yeah.

369
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,390
I hacked Julian's computer.

370
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,920
Caitlin had him look up two addresses:

371
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,620
16 Hawthorne Avenue and 1104 Truman Place.

372
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,830
She's trying to find the acolytes, I was trying to say.

373
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,380
What exactly would she want with Alchemy's followers?

374
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,210
She must think that he can take her to Alchemy.

375
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,060
She wants him to take her powers away.

376
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,580
We know. We heard everything.

377
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,010
Well, two acolytes, two addresses.

378
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,410
Which one's she gonna hit first?

379
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,010
- We got to watch both. - You're gonna stay here.

380
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,100
You can barely walk.

381
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,130
- I'll take Hawthorne. - I'll take Truman.

382
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,210
I care about Caitlin, but I don't want to leave Wally.

383
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,310
Dad, Barry and I will stay with Wally.

384
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,390
You go with H.R.

385
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,520
Yeah, I would love that.

386
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,170
Hey, you and me-- All-Star team, huh?

387
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:52,670
All right, you know what?

388
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,480
I'll make a couple cappuccinos for the road, right,

389
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,680
so we're ready for tonight's adventures.

390
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,500
Hey, not to worry, Barry.

391
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,120
Right? We'll help her.

392
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,630
Cisco.

393
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,230
If you find her--

394
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,340
I won't call you.

395
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,930
You've done enough.

396
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,520
The acolyte's on the second floor.

397
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,160
- Cup of joe, Joe? - No.

398
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,890
No? All right. You're a tea drinker, I bet.

399
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,770
If you want to talk nonsense,

400
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,160
I'm gonna need you to stop talking to me.

401
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,370
You're worried about your son.

402
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,180
- Do you have kids? - No.

403
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,600
Then I don't think we could possibly have a conversation

404
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,660
about how I'm feeling right now.

405
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,180
Okay, but...

406
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,740
as an interested observer, I can tell you

407
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,580
Barry admires you.

408
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,590
Yeah.

409
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,460
Well, he needs to listen to me.

410
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:50,840
Yeah, well, the reason he doesn't

411
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,200
is Barry's real superpower isn't speed.

412
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,170
It's hope.

413
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,620
Kid's got an endless reservoir.

414
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,200
Believes everything's gonna work out.

415
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,970
Well, he's wrong about this one.

416
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,950
They all are. I said it before:

417
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,070
when my gut tells me something is off,

418
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,180
I trust it.

419
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,630
And I need them to trust me.

420
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,980
The next time your gut tells our team what to do,

421
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,020
I'll trust it.

422
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,720
How do I know you're not just telling me what I want to hear?

423
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,970
Well, what does your gut tell you?

424
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,580
- What is that? - The satellite.

425
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,470
It's programmed to detect

426
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,430
rapid temperature decelerations.

427
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,410
That's the house Cisco's watching.

428
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,460
Oh, God.

429
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,540
Honey? Craig?

430
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,260
It's freezing in here. Go check the thermostat.

431
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,170
- Are you serious? - Yes.

432
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,950
Both of my parents are doctors.

433
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,970
It's all I ever wanted to be.

436
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,130
I was obsessed with it.

437
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,330
If anyone was even gonna step on a bug,

438
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:26,910
I would say, "Do no harm."

439
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,740
It's built into my DNA.

440
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,890
Unfortunately, my DNA isn't what it used to be.

441
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,950
So, believe me when I say

442
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,990
answer every one of my questions,

443
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,450
or I will harm you and your family.

444
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,600
- Who is Alchemy? - I don't know.

445
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,200
I've never seen him without the mask.

446
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,210
I know he can give people powers.

447
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,680
Can he take them away?

448
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,550
Yes.

449
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,000
But you can't make Alchemy do anything.

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,220
He's just an acolyte, like me.

451
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,000
We both serve the speed god, Savitar.

452
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,860
He's shown us the future.

453
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,250
I saw you there.

454
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,800
You were glorious and powerful.

455
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,190
My lord has special plans for you,

456
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,140
Caitlin Snow.

457
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,540
Or should I say

458
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,120
Killer Frost?

459
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,670
Caitlin!

460
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,360
Really?

461
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,540
You brought your toys?

462
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,770
I'm hoping it won't come to that.

463
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,900
It won't.

464
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,550
Look, I'm not leaving you out here.

465
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,250
I want to help you.

466
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,620
There's only one person who can help me.

467
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,560
Really?

468
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,980
You really think seeking medical advice

469
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,490
from someone named Dr. Alchemy

470
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,990
is the way to go?

471
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,220
Why not?

472
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,310
My name is Killer Frost.

473
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,290
Your name

474
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,100
is Caitlin Snow.

475
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,310
Can Caitlin Snow do this?

476
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,370
Caitlin, please!

477
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,880
How's the leg?

478
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,320
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

479
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,190
That was cold, Flash.

480
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,170
But this is colder.

481
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,550
Start vibrating. It'll warm you up.

482
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,970
Guess I just needed a little sleep.

483
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,810
Thanks, guys.

484
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,450
I'm feeling much better now.

485
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,200
It's okay. You can let me out.

486
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,260
I promise I'm not gonna hurt anybody.

487
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,590
Guess you're all smarter than I thought.

488
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,660
You know, that was some blast there, Vibe boy.

489
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,990
It kind of hurt.

490
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,490
I didn't want to hurt you.

491
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,050
You're pathetic.

492
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,450
Alchemy can't help you.

493
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,500
But we can. I promise.

494
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,340
Oh, like you promised Eddie?

495
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,610
And like you promised Ronnie?

496
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,230
You know, for a hero, Flash,

497
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,730
you sure let a lot of people around you die.

498
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,550
This isn't you talking. It's the powers.

499
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,430
They're messing with your mind. You're sick.

500
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,630
I'm broken, Barry.

501
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,380
But what do you care?

502
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,680
'Cause you've got Iris.

503
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,800
You got your happy ending.

504
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,320
Everyone else be damned.

505
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,350
So, I'll tell you what:

506
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,280
you guys let me go,

507
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,130
and I will leave you to your sad and miserable lives.

508
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,570
No. We're not abandoning you.

509
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,810
You did this to me!

510
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,470
Do you have any idea how we can reverse this?

511
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,810
How we can get her back?

512
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,030
It's like Caitlin said:

513
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,090
sometimes when things get broken,

514
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,600
they can't be fixed.

515
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,670
My son's not gonna end up like Caitlin.

516
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,740
Help me get him out of this thing.

517
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,610
Oh, no, no. Joe, no. We don't--we don't want

518
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,290
to touch that thing-- first off, we don't know

519
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,200
what that's gonna do to Wally, right?

520
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,660
Maybe this is the kind of situation

521
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,710
best left to the people with the science.

522
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,020
You mean Caitlin?

523
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,610
Please help me.

524
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,610
What are you doing down here?

525
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:53,260
We should all be working

526
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,160
to find Alchemy and Savitar and figure out how to stop them.

527
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,320
Instead, we're fighting each other.

528
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,020
Yeah. Team Flash is not at its finest.

529
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,300
Why didn't I just follow you inside the house?

530
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,980
Because you were hurting.

531
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,720
You would do anything to make the pain go away.

532
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,920
That's why Caitlin is so lost. And Cisco.

533
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,680
We will do anything to make the pain stop.

534
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,930
That doesn't make you a bad person.

535
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,390
That makes you human.

536
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,000
Tell that to my friends.

537
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,690
My best friends,

538
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,260
one of them is locked up like a villain;

539
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,520
the other one hates me.

540
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,400
You can not take this all on yourself.

541
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,350
Why not?

542
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,640
How do you know that Caitlin wasn't already affected

543
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,630
by the accelerator explosion,

544
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,490
or that Dante wouldn't have died in a car accident anyway?

545
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,360
You are not God, Barry.

546
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,650
That's what Jay said.

547
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,300
Jay's a smart man.

548
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,380
You can not keep doing this to yourself,

549
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,190
constantly going over the what-ifs. You'll go nuts.

550
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,880
Everyone in this building needs The Flash right now:

551
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,780
my dad, Wally-- even Cisco and Caitlin.

552
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,730
So, be strong like I know you are.

553
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,710
I know you don't want to be the leader right now,

554
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,760
but you have to be.

555
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,900
I told you I couldn't do this without you.

556
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,250
And you'll never have to.

557
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,320
- Wally. - Yeah. Come on.

558
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,250
There's an energy surge coming from the Cortex.

559
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,310
What?

560
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,090
Joe! Hey! What are you doing?

561
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:39,900
Hey, Barr.

562
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,280
Hey, stop! You can't cut him out!

563
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,440
I have to.

564
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,140
Joe, don't!

565
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,340
Wally.

566
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:15,200
Wally?

567
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,650
Joe

568
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,320
What did I do?

569
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,760
Was this your idea?

570
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,640
No. Joe--I was helping Joe.

571
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,650
No sign of Wally. I've got the satellite scanning

572
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,350
the entire city for rapid movement.

573
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,560
If he's a speedster,

574
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,180
he could be halfway across the country by now.

575
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,440
Barry, we have to find him.

576
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,540
I'm more worried about what happens when we do find him.

577
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,170
He didn't seem like he was all there, Iris.

578
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,370
I shouldn't have cut him out of that thing.

579
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,020
Joe, I--what we need right now is a biochemist.

580
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,710
You've got to go talk to her, Barr.

581
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,860
All right.

582
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,510
We need your help, Caitlin.

583
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,130
Wally--he's--

584
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,790
he's out of the cocoon, but his biochemistry

585
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,680
is all out of whack. He went AWOL.

586
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,500
So?

587
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,070
So, when we find him, he's gonna need your help.

588
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,620
He's gonna need your medical expertise,

589
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,460
your experience with metas.

590
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,400
What he needs is Caitlin Snow, MD.

591
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,620
So, you came to try and talk some sense into me.

592
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,060
No.

593
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,330
I came to let you go.

595
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,980
For a smart guy,

596
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,800
that was an awfully dumb move.

597
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,190
Like I said, you're free to go.

598
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,040
What's the catch?

599
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,860
You have to kill me.

600
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,160
- What is he doing? - I don't know.

601
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,490
It's gonna be all right.

602
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,460
You want to fight, Flash?

603
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,560
No. I'm not gonna fight you.

604
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,730
But if you want to leave this room,

605
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,620
you're gonna have to kill me.

606
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,970
- Don't think I won't. - Then do it.

607
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,900
What are you waiting for?

608
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,800
What's the big deal?

609
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,270
Come on. Live up to your name, Killer Frost.

610
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,870
I want to see some killing.

611
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,590
You want to be the villain?

612
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,260
This is what they do. They kill their friends,

613
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,460
because nothing matters to them anymore, right?

614
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,460
Right?

615
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,320
Come on.

616
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,500
Kill me, Caitlin.

617
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:46,960
You can't do it.

618
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,970
You can't,

619
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,920
because underneath all that cold,

620
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,190
you're still you.

621
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,990
Barry!

622
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,390
It's okay.

623
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,650
I got you.

624
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,020
It's okay.

625
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:16,140
I think extracting Wally early from that cocoon

626
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,700
left him in a fugue state.

627
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,570
His synapses aren't used to functioning at superspeed,

628
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,820
so his mind and muscles are misfiring.

629
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,340
I mean, will this stuff help?

630
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,090
I've synthesized a neural compound

631
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,310
that I think will get his mind and body

632
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,980
running at the same speed.

633
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,010
We just have to find him first.

634
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,410
Where'd he go, Joe?

635
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:39,860
What's your gut tell you?

636
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,460
The house that he grew up in.

637
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,400
He used to go there when he missed his mother.

638
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,580
In Keystone.

639
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,290
Thank you.

641
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,600
Wally! Wally!

642
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,160
It's your dad, son.

643
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,100
You're gonna be all right.

644
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,300
We're gonna take care of you, okay?

645
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,100
Dad.

646
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,870
Damn. How fast is he going?

647
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,210
Faster than Barry could at the beginning.

648
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,860
I, uh--

649
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,090
I just wanted to--

650
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,830
It's okay.

651
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,430
You scared me for a second,

652
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,910
getting all Mother of Dragons on me with that hair.

653
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,980
Thank you.

654
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,570
That is the greatest feeling I've ever felt.

655
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,780
- Barry, it's unreal. - Yeah, it is.

656
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,000
- How fast was I going? - Too fast.

657
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:13,050
Dad, don't look so worried. I'm fine.

658
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:15,910
I feel fine. In fact, I feel kind of awesome,

659
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:18,390
like everything is buzzing, electric,

660
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,240
like I could do anything.

661
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,660
That is what it feels like.

662
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,530
Got the Speed Force coursing through you

663
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,620
giving you power.

664
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,160
You're a speedster now.

665
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,540
Cool.

666
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,430
So, what next?

667
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,140
Caitlin is gonna run every test she can think of on you.

668
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,360
I mean, if you're up for it.

669
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,470
Being a doctor? That, I'm always up for.

670
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,380
Yeah, um, but when do I get to go out, Barry,

671
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,440
with you?

672
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,520
Okay, let's just take it

673
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,190
one normal-speed step at a time.

674
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,360
Slow down, Wallace.

675
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,380
Barr, it's the hospital.

676
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,550
Julian's awake.

677
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,790
He knows it was me. He knows what I did.

678
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,560
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.

679
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,970
You'll be fine. I promise.

680
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,530
Hey, man.

681
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,030
I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about--

682
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,470
I don't.

683
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,530
All right.

684
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,450
Look, Cisco, you're my best friend, man.

685
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,890
Are we gonna be okay?

686
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,100
You and me?

687
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,450
You want me to be honest with you?

688
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,620
Yeah. Yeah.

689
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,500
I don't know.

690
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,770
Okay.

691
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,690
Hey, Patterson.

692
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,820
Barry Allen, don't you ever work?

693
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,400
I just wanted to make sure that Julian was doing okay.

694
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,290
Well, I'm about to take his statement, yeah.

695
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,720
Would it be okay if I talked to him before you went in?

696
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,310
I just--we're pretty close, him and I.

697
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,650
Yeah. Go ahead. Just make it quick.

698
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,400
Always. Thank you.

699
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:36,490
A hospital visit. I didn't think you missed me that much.

700
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,080
What did the doctors say?

701
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,830
Concussion and frostbite,

702
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,620
but I'll be dandy in a few days.

703
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,310
That's good news. I'm glad you're gonna be all right.

704
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,760
Yes, and as much as I appreciate

705
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,220
your outburst of emotion,

706
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,430
I think we both know the real reason you're here.

707
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,470
Your friend Caitlin Snow.

708
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,880
She's a meta,

709
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,720
and not one of the friendly ones.

710
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,570
Did you know?

711
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,300
She's sick, Julian.

712
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,430
She is a bloody menace.

713
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,990
Julian--

714
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,810
Man, I know that you think that getting powers is

715
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:14,100
this binary game, that you're either good or evil,

716
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,260
but life isn't like that, even for Metas.

717
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,390
Look. Caitlin--she's a good person.

718
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,170
I'm begging you£¬don't turn her in.

719
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,730
I will do anything you want,but

720
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,360
please don't do this to her.

721
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,110
I got hit pretty hard,

722
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,980
and I don't have the foggiest

723
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,660
who even kidnapped me at all.

724
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,290
Thank you, man.

725
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,070
Thank you.

726
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,600
There is one thing you can do for me, mate.

727
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,150
Anything.

728
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,150
Quit.

729
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,130
What?

730
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:01,010
Tender your resignation

731
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,790
from the Central City Police Department,

732
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,660
effective immediately.

733
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,020
I can overlook the unexplained absences,

734
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,450
the constant disregard for the rules and regulations,

735
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,160
but your moral compass is broken, my friend.

736
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,050
I point-blank refuse

737
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,600
to work with someone whose sense of right or wrong is

738
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,700
as flippant as the weather,

739
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,850
someone who thinks friendship is more important than justice.

740
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,730
You are unfit to be CSI.

741
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,620
Barry Allen has no place in law enforcement.

742
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,900
Now, do we have an agreement,

743
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,160
or would you like the detective to meet that girl?

744
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,420
All right.

745
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,470
He's all yours.

746
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,310
Hey, Albert.

747
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,480
So, what can you tell me about our--our meta friend?

748
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:14,410
I don't really remember anything.

749
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,160
To be honest with you, it's all a bit of a blur, so...

750
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,640
We just heard from Singh.

751
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,820
You quit? What--what is going on?

752
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,030
I, um...

753
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,180
didn't really have a choice.

754
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,780
What do you mean, you didn't have a choice?

755
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,130
Julian.

756
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,930
You quit, he keeps his mouth shut about Caitlin.

757
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
That son of a bitch.

758
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,630
I don't know. I mean, he said I couldn't

759
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,690
do something like protect Caitlin

760
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,070
and still be a good CSI,

761
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,170
and maybe he's right.

762
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,440
No, he's not.

763
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,030
Barry, you are an incredible CSI,

764
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,170
and no one in this building cares more

765
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,470
about helping people find justice than you.

766
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,390
And that was long before you were The Flash.

767
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,110
This lab--it's your life.

768
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,350
You're my life.

769
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,030
Both of you.

770
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:10,120
And Wally and Caitlin,

771
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,340
Cisco.

772
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,530
If these past few months have taught me anything,

773
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,020
it's that I would give up everything I have

774
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:19,900
to keep you all safe.

775
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,130
No regrets.

776
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,600
Every time I think you've

777
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,380
run out of ways to be a hero,

778
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,720
you show me another one.

779
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,100
- You hungry? - Yeah.

780
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,520
Yeah, let's get out of here.

781
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,670
Julian.

782
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,980
Julian!

783
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,630
No. Stay away.

784
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,020
No, Julian. You can't get away.

785
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,250
There's nowhere I won't find you.

786
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,730
Only together

787
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,770
can we bring about my return.

788
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,320
Become my servant once more.

789
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,640
Become Alchemy.
