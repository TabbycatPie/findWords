17
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,390
Something went wrong.

18
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,610
We got Dwyer. We gave him the cure.

19
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,100
This should all be over.

20
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,000
But another Cicada showed up,

21
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,800
took Dwyer and the dagger.

22
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,570
Thawne! Did you hear what I said?

23
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,150
Another Cicada showed up.

24
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,240
I know.

25
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,290
I know.

26
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,560
Who is that?

27
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,130
I have no idea.

28
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,820
You said manipulating the timeline would stop Cicada.

29
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,040
You said you knew what you were doing!

30
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,420
I know what I said.

31
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,050
I was very wrong.

32
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,160
What do we do? What do we do now?

33
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,920
I can't help you anymore...

34
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:56,930
little runner.

35
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,470
What?

36
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,330
You have to help me.

37
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,920
It's too late.

38
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,530
No.

39
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,440
There's gotta be something we can do.

40
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,410
You--you have to help!

41
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
There is only one thing left to do.

42
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,270
Tell your father.

43
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,790
You tell your father everything.

46
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,270
Your lung's healing.

47
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,070
It'll take a while for you to get

48
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,520
the rest of your strength back,

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560
but don't worry.

50
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,740
I'll take care of you.

51
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,380
Like you took care of me.

52
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,120
Who are you?

53
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,870
Grace?

54
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,090
Hi, Uncle Orlin.

55
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,650
But you were--

56
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,820
A ten-year-old girl in a coma?

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,160
Eventually, that girl at the hospital wakes up.

58
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,950
She grows older,

59
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,160
and she becomes me.

60
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,950
You're from the future, like Flash's daughter.

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,870
I came back here to work with you again.

62
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,410
And I remember everything you taught me, Uncle Orlin.

63
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,140
Now, get some rest.

64
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,010
Wait.

65
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,530
Where are we?

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,470
No one will find you while I'm gone.

67
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,790
There's noodles in the pantry if you're hungry.

68
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,480
And ice cream.

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,880
Where are you going?

70
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,980
To take care of something important.

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
When I get back...

72
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,660
We're gonna figure out how you get your powers back.

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,670
And Dr. Ambres never talked about

75
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,630
her relationship with Orlin Dwyer?

76
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,510
She never really talked about anything.

77
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,710
After her fianc¨¦ died,

78
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,310
she wasn't quite the same.

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,530
How so?

80
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,680
Angry. Withdrawn.

81
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,090
Only time she seemed happy

82
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,880
was when she was with that girl in the coma.

83
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,890
Can you think of anything that might help us find Dwyer?

84
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,430
I'm sorry, Detective.

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,010
Okay, if you come up with anything,

86
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,660
would you give me a call, please?

87
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,570
Thank you.

88
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,510
Somebody's gotta know something.

89
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,640
Everyone we've talked to is telling the truth.

90
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,920
I think Ambres was the only one working with Dwyer.

91
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,990
Well, look, we'll pore over the files at CCPD.

92
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,400
Maybe we missed something.

93
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,550
We'll let you know if we come up with anything, all right?

94
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,920
You okay?

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,760
I just, uh...

96
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,490
don't know what to do.

97
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,860
Yeah, me neither.

98
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,990
We've hit walls before, though.

99
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,650
We'll figure it out.

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,980
All right.

104
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,430
Nora West-Allen, let's see what we have here.

105
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,120
Boring. Boring. Boring.

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,090
Banality. Boring. Boring.

107
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,420
Come on.

108
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,000
I know you're working with someone, but no names.

110
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,580
Clever girl.

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,340
Cortex isn't gonna clean itself, you know.

112
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,470
Oh, nice table. Liking the new digs.

113
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,000
Well, technically, they're old digs,

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,840
but I guess there is an upside to remodeling after an attack.

115
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,860
Did you guys find anything?

116
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,790
Well, I put out an article,

117
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,980
but none of my readers have seen Dwyer

118
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,410
or this new Cicada.

119
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,180
I talked to Earl Cox, all my contacts...

120
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,890
nothing.

121
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,960
How long till the satellite can scan for dark matter?

122
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,150
How about now?

123
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,190
Well, if this new Cicada even has traceable dark matter.

124
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,170
I mean, we've seen Cicada num¨¦ro deux do things

125
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,480
that we've not seen before, right?

126
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,160
Yeah, I mean, he can dampen powers,

127
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,190
he can control the dagger just like Dwyer,

128
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,620
but it's-- I don't know, it's also like...

129
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,630
Like he could take control of us.

130
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,280
Let's hope Caitlin can figure that out at the Tannhauser site

131
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,480
while we figure out where he is.

134
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,420
We got a Starchives asset in Kolins Woods.

136
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,390
Starchives? What is this?

137
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,360
Well, it's a place where we house everything Flash related--

138
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,300
prototypes, super suits--

139
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,020
I mean, everything since day one.

140
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,670
Okay, and the alarm is going off because...

141
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,380
Because somebody just stole something from us.

142
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,980
Something really, really, not good.

143
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,660
You guys at the Starchives yet?

144
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,010
We just got here.

145
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,530
No sign of forced entry.

146
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,490
Or overhead lighting, apparently.

147
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,760
Pretty sure that's a vacuum.

148
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,060
Okay, keep looking!

149
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,140
Remind me again what we're looking for?

150
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,440
Uh, it's like a huge round glass bubble.

151
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,180
You mean like that?

152
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,460
- Yeah-- We found it! - We found it!

153
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,030
Thawne's Time Sphere? Are you sure?

154
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,270
- What do you mean "Am I sure?" - Pretty sure.

155
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,060
I'm looking right at it, why?

156
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,700
'Cause we're looking right at it too.

157
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,900
So it's here and in the Starchives at the same time?

158
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,270
Somebody stole the plans and made a duplicate?

159
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,520
Not exactly.

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,940
Guys, cue up Operation: Shazam.

161
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,830
Ready.

162
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,070
One scratch on two different Time Spheres.

163
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,560
Or one scratch on one Time Sphere.

164
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,600
That's impossible... unless--

165
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,780
Unless it's the same one.

166
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,710
It is the same one.

167
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,650
This is our Time Sphere.

168
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,460
Which shows up here at the same time

169
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,430
that someone who looks like Cicada kidnaps Orlin Dwyer.

170
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,940
It's not a coincidence.

171
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,400
So whoever kidnapped Dwyer--

172
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,150
Is the Cicada from the future.

173
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,220
You move, I shoot.

174
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,030
That was dumb.

175
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,500
It was him, wasn't it?

176
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,030
The other Cicada.

177
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,350
Guy didn't know what hit him.

178
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,390
You said he was after a cold case file?

179
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,710
- Are any of them digitized? - Not yet.

180
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,660
But the only way to figure out what's missing

181
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,460
is to see what's still here.

182
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,350
I mean...

183
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,580
I could help with that.

184
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,470
All right, everybody. Clear out.

185
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,040
CSI needs this scene.

186
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,320
Hey, by the way,

187
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,130
this might not be our only lead.

188
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,640
Do you remember that Time Sphere that we built for Thawne?

189
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
That big hamster ball thing?

190
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,000
Someone stole one in the future to come here.

191
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,960
For what, our-our Cicada copycat?

192
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,280
It makes sense.

193
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,720
I can't even believe I just said that.

194
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,390
- Okay, son, you're on. - Yup.

195
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,310
Okay, I went through everything.

196
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,890
There was indeed one file missing.

197
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,740
And it's--thank you-it is from 2017.

198
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,600
That's it.

199
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,720
All right, I'll do some digging,

200
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,040
see why this was so important,

201
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,620
they had to cut a hole in the wall.

202
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,230
I'll help.

203
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,300
Are you sure you want to do this?

204
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,730
I mean, this is a big deal.

207
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,420
Okay.

208
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,820
Kamilla Hwang, you and I are officially...

209
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,490
"In a Relationship."

210
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,410
- Social media official! - What!

211
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,770
Larry, my usual.

212
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,440
It's Jason.

213
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,570
Ralph! What's, um--

214
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,500
what are you doing here?

215
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,380
Same as you

216
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
taking a break from saving the old world.

217
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,540
Look at you two.

218
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,980
Young love.

219
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,180
So, uh, K-Dawg, when you gonna meet the group?

220
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,710
Uh, the group?

221
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:09,130
Yeah, the squad, the team. The gang.

222
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,580
Uh, hey, we're actually in the middle of a date here.

223
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,410
Actually, we're at the end of a date, babe.

224
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,320
- I have that gig. - Oh, right.

225
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,550
Your Easter thing. You have to go.

226
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,620
- She has to go. - Oh, uh, Cisco?

227
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm supposed to tell you that Barry wanted to talk to you.

228
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,940
Probably could've texted that.

229
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,630
Yeah, probably.

230
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,350
Okay, well, Easter Bunny photos

231
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,450
aren't gonna take themselves.

232
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,410
It's kind of a bottom-of-the-barrel photography gig,

233
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,150
but gotta start somewhere, right?

234
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,630
- Totally. - Anywhere but here.

235
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,540
- Why don't I walk you out? - Oh, okay.

236
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,630
Damn it, Larry!

237
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,220
Still Jason!

238
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,380
Voil¨¤, voil¨¤, voil¨¤.

239
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,330
Let's see what we have here.

240
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,340
Thawne's Time Sphere.

241
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,820
What are you doing, Sherloque?

243
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,250
Well, I'm pursuing a new lead

244
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,560
to identify the mystery Cicada.

245
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,970
Well, if you needed information about the Time Sphere,

246
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,980
you could've just asked.

247
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,320
That's right, but memory can be deceiving.

248
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,280
Especially for a regular human.

249
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,820
No, I prefer a primary source.

250
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,480
And this new lead,

251
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,000
were you pursuing it last night too?

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,470
- That's right. - And all last weekend?

253
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,070
That's right.

254
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,010
I am working very hard to get...

255
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,240
to get what I want.

257
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,940
Joe traced the file that our new Cicada took.

258
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,570
There was a meta attack here two years ago.

259
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,730
Two people died, and the meta was never ID'd.

260
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,140
So this new Cicada might be going after this meta?

261
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,590
Okay.

262
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,040
What do I vibe?

263
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,940
Well, we're not exactly sure.

264
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,400
All the street cameras were destroyed by the explosion.

265
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,070
The original ATM was too fried to recover any data.

266
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,530
- For real? - Yeah.

267
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,390
Well, I'm out.

268
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,520
I can't vibe a crime scene that does not exist.

269
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,810
Literally does not exist.

270
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,690
I mean, even this ATM is, like, brand-spanking-new.

271
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,700
But this concrete isn't.

272
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,670
It still has scorch marks on it.

273
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,080
Hold this.

274
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,950
Sweetie! You forgot your ATM card.

275
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,720
What'd you see?

276
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,170
The victims.

277
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,460
They were Grace Gibbons' parents.

278
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,910
In Grace's mindscape, she saw herself as Cicada.

279
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,440
And another Cicada shows up targeting her parents' killer.

280
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,870
It has to be her.

281
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,530
The new Cicada is Grace Gibbons.

282
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,680
From the future.

283
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,850
Time travel sucks.

284
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,670
Grace, what's wrong?

285
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,390
Look at this.

286
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,670
It's your parents' murder file?

287
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,230
Do you see what they did?

288
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,430
Nothing!

289
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,060
Three witnesses saw a woman in a hoodie

290
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,450
leave the scene, but did Central City's finest

291
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,820
put out a search party or an APB?

292
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,270
No. They thought it sounded like a job for the Flash.

293
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,580
Look at this debris from the scene.

294
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,650
Looks like a chemical burn.

295
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,590
It's not a chemical burn.

296
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,200
It's charred dark matter residue.

297
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,430
We can track the meta who left it.

298
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,760
How?

299
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,380
I can't track an exact real time location,

300
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,050
but I can get close.

301
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,050
Found her.

302
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,460
Grace, what are you doing?

303
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,480
In the time I'm from, their plague spreads

304
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,750
across the world, unchecked, unabated.

305
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,790
But now that I'm here with you,

306
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,040
we can change that.

307
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,330
And the mission can succeed.

308
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,480
What mission?

309
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,810
Ours.

310
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,700
To kill every last meta-human.

311
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,290
Starting with the rat bastard who killed my parents.

312
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,200
So, Cicada II is really Grace from the future,

313
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,010
and she's trying to get revenge on the meta

314
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,000
that murdered her parents and that killer meta is here?

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,680
Cisco saw the last PIN that was entered into the ATM.

316
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,930
The card belongs to Vickie and John Bolen.

317
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,010
We already went by their house,

318
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,900
and a neighbor said they were having a party here.

319
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,560
Um, I think this is them.

320
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,840
Excuse me, sir?

321
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,750
Detective Joe West, we're from CCPD.

322
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,170
Are you Mr. John Bolen?

323
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,700
I am. How can I help you?

324
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,180
What's going on? Oh.

325
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,160
Sorry to be rude,

326
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,170
but we're in the middle of a party.

327
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,350
This won't take long. Um...

328
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,110
Do you remember using an ATM on Kingswell and 42nd

329
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,840
around May 4th, 2017?

330
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,780
There was an explosion that day.

331
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,320
We think a meta-human might have been involved.

332
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,870
Hon, why don't you and Alice start gathering

333
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,240
the kids for a team photo?

334
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,920
I'll talk to the nice officers.

335
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,840
Okay.

336
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,370
I can't believe you found me after all this time.

337
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,820
We'd just like to know what happened that day.

338
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,990
Did you blow up that ATM?

339
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,690
I-it all happened so fast.

340
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,970
I touched the machine,

341
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,240
and it was like something turned on in me.

342
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,930
You hyper-accelerated the molecules in the ATM,

343
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,230
causing a violent chain reaction.

344
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,590
I just know I saw sparks and ran.

345
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,470
Then I heard this explosion

346
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,230
and money was flying everywhere.

347
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,230
It looked like I was trying to rob the bank.

348
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,780
I was too afraid to go back.

349
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,760
At least no one got hurt.

350
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,400
Mrs. Bolen, we have reason to believe

351
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,700
a killer is targeting you.

352
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,560
Why?

353
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,750
It's because of your... abilities.

354
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,630
Listen, we'd like to put you in federal protection

355
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,070
to keep your family safe.

356
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,620
And what would I tell my husband?

357
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,790
Or my daughter?

358
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,400
"Hey, sorry, Mommy has powers."

359
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,320
We all have to leave our lives behind.

360
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,230
They don't know about your powers?

361
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,710
Of course not. No one does.

362
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,260
You think I'm proud of this?

363
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,980
I think they have a right to know the truth.

364
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,240
They're your family.

365
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,340
And who the hell do you think you are,

366
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,710
telling me what to do?

367
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,750
We're not going anywhere.

368
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,770
That's final.

369
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,010
Please leave.

370
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,680
She's not safe. We're staying put.

371
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,700
I got your text. What's the emergency?

372
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,490
Okay. Listen to me very carefully.

373
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,430
I took a break from serial killer kidnapper madness

374
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,630
to do something awesome.

375
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,630
So I decided on a new career path.

376
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,090
Photography was always my passion,

377
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,760
and I figured why not make it my job?

378
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,300
These are great, Kamilla.

379
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,860
I Peter Parker'd her.

380
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,590
Dibs, sidebar.

381
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,340
Sidebar?

382
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,800
Sidebar, now!

383
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,540
You have, uh... Peter Parker'd her.

384
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,920
Yeah, I mean, Kamilla is a great photographer

385
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,390
and I thought she could start taking some pictures for Iris,

386
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,710
and then maybe she'd start to come around S.T.A.R. Labs.

387
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,960
I don't know, if we're lucky, get bitten

388
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,580
by something radioactive.

389
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,950
Become, like, a Spider-Person.

390
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,850
So, while you thought, did it occur to you

391
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,580
that no one asked you to do this?

392
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,060
You don't think she'd make a good Spider-Person?

393
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,100
You listen to me and you listen good,

394
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,410
you turkey on stilts.

395
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,420
It is not your job

396
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,950
to get my girlfriend on the team!

397
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,290
- Hey, guys. - Hey, you two!

398
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,450
You guys are getting along in there, I see that.

399
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,700
What's going on?

400
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,390
Your friend Iris was actually

401
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,870
just giving me a photography gig.

402
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,410
Well, it's small, but Kamilla has agreed to shoot

403
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,700
the Fairway parade for the "Citizen" this weekend.

404
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,410
Shut the front door.

405
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,230
That is unbelievable.

406
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,010
Congrats. That's amazing.

407
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,500
Hey, why don't you and I go, uh, drink and celebrate?

408
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,830
Oh, sure. Um, I will text you later.

409
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,360
Yes, that sounds great. Thank you.

410
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,670
- You ready? - Yeah.

411
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,540
Well, well, well.

412
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,540
Bonjour, Eobard Thawne.

413
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,370
If I am Eobard Thawne,

414
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,030
what kind of man am I?

415
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,580
Patient, right?

416
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,210
Master of science.

417
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,080
But also...

418
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,000
a master of...

419
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,100
subterfuge.

420
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,050
Because not only...

421
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,970
am I...

422
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,680
Eobard Thawne,

423
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,810
but I'm also...

424
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,350
Dr. Harrison Wells.

425
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,480
And that man...

426
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,570
that man would keep his secrets...

427
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,910
...close.

428
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,790
What have we here?

429
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,170
Well, well, well.

430
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,420
Bonjour.

431
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,930
How could Vickie not know she killed two people?

432
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,730
There was a time in Central City

433
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,270
where not all meta attacks were public knowledge.

434
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,060
Why not? I mean, people should know--

435
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,820
Former Mayor Bellows...

436
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,480
...tried to keep certain things out of the media.

437
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,530
Said he didn't want to create a panic.

438
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,690
Turns out he had metas on the payroll.

439
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,070
Didn't want the heat.

440
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,900
That's Cecile. I'll be right back.

441
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,910
You were wrong, you know.

442
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,200
About what?

443
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,380
About Vickie not wanting to tell her family

444
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,590
about her abilities.

445
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,660
It's her choice not to tell them.

446
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,090
Look, keeping a secret like that

447
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,470
from her family is-- it's dangerous.

448
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,010
I mean, they might get hurt or worse.

449
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,560
She's just trying to protect them.

450
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,760
I get that, I do, but...

451
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,770
I-I used to think that keeping secrets from people

452
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,690
for their own good was a noble decision,

453
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,280
that it would protect them.

454
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,440
But when you do that, you just rob those people

455
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,610
from making their own decisions.

456
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,900
I even did it with you.

457
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,820
Like when you didn't want to take me to your past.

458
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,210
I didn't want you to see how painful

459
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,540
things got for me as the Flash

460
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,660
or how bad things got for your mom.

461
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,910
But secrets are like walls, and...

462
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,370
you can't really know someone with walls between you.

463
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,300
Are you okay?

464
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,220
I must have connected to Grace's mind.

465
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,680
She's coming.

466
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,310
Grace is coming.

467
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,480
I don't see Cicada anywhere. Do you?

468
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,190
It's the Flash!

469
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,950
Mom, you got Flash and XS cosplayers for the party?

470
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,200
Yes, I am the Flash! And I love...

471
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,420
soccer, do you guys love soccer?

472
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,300
Do you want to-- yeah, or--awesome!

473
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,050
Come with me!

474
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,670
Here, let's play some soccer over here.

475
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,630
This way. This way. Come on, come on, come on.

476
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,470
Help me with the kids. Come on, come on!

477
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,100
Far away from there.

478
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,470
- What's going on? - Cicada is coming here.

479
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,670
- What? - Now.

480
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,270
We can move everyone else out of here,

481
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,100
but you and your family have to come with me.

482
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,930
All right.

483
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,410
- Murderer. - Grace, stop.

484
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,650
She's innocent. It was an accident.

485
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,150
There are no accidents, Nora.

486
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:43,830
Vickie?

487
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,290
- We have to help Mom. - Alice!

488
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,500
Alice, no!

489
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,050
Alice!

490
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,350
My speed's back.

491
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,890
We need to get them out of here.

492
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,860
I'll find you.

493
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,970
I can't believe that little girl in there

494
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,430
grows up to be a time-traveling serial killer.

495
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,310
Why can't we just wake her up right now?

496
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,150
We tried before. It didn't work.

497
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,400
What about the meta cure y'all cooked up?

498
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,280
We'd need Grace's consent.

499
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,490
Besides, Caitlin says that her condition

500
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,900
is too fragile to even try.

501
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,740
And I'm assuming that destroying the time-traveling hamster ball,

502
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,280
that messes up the timeline?

503
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,750
Yeah, it would probably just make things even worse.

504
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,500
- God! - What's wrong?

505
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,620
Her mind.

506
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,210
It's exactly the same as the Cicada

507
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,790
that attacked us at S.T.A.R. Labs.

508
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:57,170
Oh, my God, it's filled with nothing but hatred.

509
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,590
Nora found out when she went into Grace's mind

510
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,630
that Grace could hear Dwyer, even in her coma--

511
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,220
his anger, his rage.

512
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,680
She was listening.

513
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,510
She can carry out his words.

514
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:09,970
Hey, guys.

515
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,230
Alice is back from the OR and she's okay,

516
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,610
but her parents are really not.

517
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,980
Vickie, I asked you to leave!

518
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,610
She's my daughter.

519
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,660
No. I want my dad.

520
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,410
Can't you see that she's terrified of you?

521
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,280
She could've been killed!

522
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,040
I was trying to protect you guys.

523
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,290
By lying? You're a meta, Vickie!

524
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,830
A human time bomb!

525
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,000
How do you keep that from us?

526
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,420
Mr. Bolen... let's take a breath.

527
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,540
Let's step outside.

528
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,730
We did the right thing.

529
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,140
We kept this family safe.

530
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,890
Then why does it feel like we made everything so much worse?

531
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,340
Need any help with that, uh--

532
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,040
Nope.

533
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,840
Unless you came here to break something,

534
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,330
in which case you'd be the perfect candidate.

535
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,340
I deserve that.

536
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,510
Never should've interfered with Kamilla.

537
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,220
Sometimes, I forget how...

538
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,100
embarrassing I can be.

539
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,230
I'm not embarrassed by you, and I'm not embarrassed

540
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,530
by anyone on Team Flash.

541
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,610
You guys are my family. You're not the problem.

542
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,230
This is the problem. This is the problem.

543
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:52,040
Kamilla is blissfully unaware

544
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,080
of any of the madness that goes on in S.T.A.R. Labs,

545
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,750
or that we routinely save the city from evil metas.

546
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,210
Or that you have a secret identity

547
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,790
and dress up in leather and go all pew-pew!

548
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,170
Especially the leather.

549
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,800
She and I, we got a good thing.

550
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,920
And being with somebody has never felt so...

551
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,140
so easy.

552
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:16,150
And when I'm with her, for once,

553
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,470
I just feel like a normal dude,

554
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,270
with a normal life

555
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,030
and a social-media-official girlfriend,

556
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,900
who happens to be a very talented photographer

557
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,650
and not... a Spider-Person.

558
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,280
It's--that's amazing, man. It really is.

559
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,450
And I promise that I will respect that.

560
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,670
But I gotta ask, how long do you think

561
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,920
you can keep those two worlds separate?

562
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,760
Look... my mom dated this guy, Craig,

563
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,760
and Craig was a tax accountant and a freelance bull rider.

564
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,260
Never let one world know about the other, and...

565
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,850
it just tore him up.

566
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,480
More than those bulls ever did.

567
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,770
I should definitely be working.

568
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,240
Look, the thing is, I get why you're afraid

569
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,320
of losing what you have with Kamilla,but

570
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,820
if you keep her out of this world...

571
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,700
it seems to me that you're always

572
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,740
gonna be turning off a part of yourself.

573
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,700
That's not right.

574
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,080
And if Craig hadn't been crushed to death

575
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,870
by that huge filing cabinet...

576
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,710
I know he'd feel the same way.

577
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,770
I didn't get her.

578
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,370
Well, maybe that's a good thing,

579
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,860
'cause I've read this file and it doesn't make sense.

580
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,160
Grace, there was no money taken from the crime scene.

581
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,250
I think what happened to your mom and dad

582
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,290
might've been an accident.

583
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,000
She killed my parents, Uncle Orlin!

584
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,830
It wasn't an accident!

585
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,880
You sound like them.

586
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,590
Why do you sound like them?

587
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:17,130
Grace, your head.

588
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,350
We gotta get you to Dr. Ambres.

589
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,640
She'll know how to help.

590
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,180
She's not helping anyone. Not anymore.

591
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,020
Why not?

592
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,190
I killed her.

593
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,530
But Dr. Ambres saved your life.

594
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,150
And destroyed yours.

595
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,830
You had a gift.

596
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,320
An unbreakable weapon that fell from the sky for you to use.

597
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,410
For you to control.

598
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,200
And she took that power away from you.

599
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,960
No, Grace.

600
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,290
I wanted that cure.

601
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,430
And I wanted you to have it too.

602
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,960
No. No, that's impossible.

603
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,140
We were supposed to do this together.

604
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,550
Grace, I just wanted you to be happy.

605
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,550
That's all I ever wanted.

606
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,520
I love you, Grace. You're my family.

607
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,570
And you'd do anything to save me, right?

608
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,950
I know what I have to do.

609
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,120
Grace, stop.

610
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,330
Grace, stop! Grace, please!

611
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,350
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

612
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,560
Bonjour, Gideon.

613
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,390
I believe I have something that belongs...

614
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,190
right here.

615
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,400
Video log, entry 247.

616
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,200
I have long struggled

617
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,540
with time's insistence on change.

618
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,740
One variable changes the timeline.

619
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,290
Our memories are changed too, without any knowledge

620
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:12,300
of time's other possibilities, but not anymore.

621
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,470
Where he is going with this?

622
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,220
Just as the human body is made up of DNA,

623
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,680
so, too, is the multiverse made up

624
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,300
of its own unique source code.

625
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,020
One that cannot be altered.

626
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,850
No matter what timeline you're in.

627
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:26,850
Until now,

628
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:30,310
because I have cracked that code.

629
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,570
And so the timeline, it can be malleable,

630
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,060
but my knowledge...

631
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,280
will be intractable.

632
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,990
Gideon, freeze video log.

633
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,950
Capture the clear board.

634
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,570
Run against handwriting sample number two.

635
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,030
The journal of Nora West-Allen.

637
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,670
Analysis complete, handwriting match

639
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,420
for Harrison Wells confirmed.

640
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,130
Will that be all, Dr. Wells?

641
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,250
Yes, Gideon.

642
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,590
That will be all.

643
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,450
And that's why I didn't tell you about my powers.

644
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,870
I thought it would be too hard for you.

645
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,420
But you're tough.

646
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,880
Tougher than I've ever been.

647
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,630
So maybe you can be tough for me too?

648
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,260
They're a good family.

649
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,600
Told you they'd figure it out.

650
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,730
Dad...

651
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,560
I need to tell you something.

652
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,230
Oh, baby, what's wrong?

653
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,940
Grace's mind.

654
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,360
Oh, it's getting so much stronger.

656
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,410
She's here.

657
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,980
Are you okay?

658
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,560
Vickie Bolen!

659
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,730
Give yourself over to me,

660
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,290
or your husband dies.

661
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,620
This Cicada doesn't care if someone's a meta or not.

662
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,210
She'll kill anyone who stands in her way.

663
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,630
XS, get her out of here before Cicada tries that again.

664
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,790
Do not slow down.

665
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,920
Detective, we need to get her somewhere safe.

666
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,460
- Mom? - I'm not leaving without Alice.

667
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,380
You're the target, Mrs. Bolen.

668
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,550
She's safer without you.

669
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,000
Come on, now, let's go.

670
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,130
Come on, sweetie, let's get you somewhere safe.

671
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,840
XS, go!

672
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,360
- What do you got? - Well, we have a situation.

673
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,440
Or two, actually.

674
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,990
So that's the new Cicada,

675
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,860
and that's the dagger chasing Nora and Ms. Bolen.

676
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,690
- Guys, I need help! - Time to move.

677
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,820
Grace.

678
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,990
Let him go.

679
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,500
I know you want revenge for your parents, but--

680
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,080
But it wasn't that woman's fault.

681
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,460
That doesn't change that they're dead.

682
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,930
Or that I became this.

683
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,290
- We can help you. - With your cure?

684
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,010
There's only one cure for this, Flash.

685
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,930
Death.

686
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,690
Guys, I can't keep this up.

687
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,440
Nora, you need to hang on for a little bit longer.

688
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,270
You're gonna turn on-- - The alleyway on Fuller.

689
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,820
The alleyway on Fuller.Be ready.

690
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,730
For what?

691
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:59,200
- Ooh, I am not loving that. - Nope.

692
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,380
Guys, we need you two at the hospital.

693
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,290
Let's go.

694
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,480
- What the hell was that? - Cisco, what happened?

695
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,020
I don't know.

696
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
Something's wrong with my breach.

697
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,260
We can't get through it!

698
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,320
I've always wanted to be up against the Flash

699
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,310
and his legendary team.

700
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,900
I guess I wasn't missing out on anything after all.

701
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,190
Grace!

702
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,400
Don't do this.

703
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,530
Please.

704
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,710
This isn't the way to make the world a better place.

705
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,870
You hated them.

706
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,540
I heard you.

707
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,540
I was wrong.

708
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,470
And that hate turned into something even worse.

709
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:51,010
It was wrong to make you feel that way, Gracie.

710
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,970
But you don't have to go down the same path I did.

711
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:58,180
You don't have to hold on to this--this anger.

712
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,220
Let it go.

713
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,360
But my parents.

714
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,650
It was an accident.

715
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,320
Let it go.

716
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:20,030
Before it's too late, like it is for me.

717
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,080
You're right, Uncle Orlin.

718
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,590
No!

719
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,390
It is too late.

720
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,820
Save my Grace.

721
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,630
I can't believe she killed Dwyer.

722
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,500
Yeah, as brutal as Dwyer was,

723
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,840
his love for his niece always kept him

724
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,330
from crossing certain lines.

725
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,620
Not Grace.

726
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,880
No, and her powers are incredibly dangerous.

727
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,350
I ran some tests while I was at the Tannhauser offsite--

728
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,060
her dark matter has some sort of binding quality.

729
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,890
It allows her to telekinetically manipulate

730
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,770
dark matter within a certain proximity.

731
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,100
Including the dark matter in us?

732
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,020
I think so.

733
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,980
I think what makes her powers different from Dwyer's

734
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,110
is that they came from a wound in her head.

735
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,530
That's why she's so much stronger.

736
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,910
How was Nora able to see what Grace was seeing?

737
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,870
Nora and Grace seem to be psychically connected.

738
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,200
I think it's because of the time that Nora spent

739
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,610
in Grace's brain.

740
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,780
- Is there any sign of her? - No.

741
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,790
She definitely ghosted.

742
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,030
What about Vickie and her family?

743
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,590
Uh, federal protection. They're gonna be fine.

744
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,540
They're getting new identities as we speak.

745
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,420
I don't know about anyone else,

746
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,430
but I could use a drink.

747
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:11,140
- Not a bad idea. - Yeah, I'm in.

748
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,710
- You want me to call a sitter? - Yeah.

749
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,340
Cisco, you want to bring Kamilla?

750
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,050
Not for this one.

751
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,430
Nora, you coming?

752
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,230
Nora.

753
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,110
You want to tell us something, don't you?

754
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,780
She wants to tell you her secret.

755
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,490
Right?

756
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,780
She doesn't know where to start.

757
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,420
Difficult to know where to begin

758
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:51,440
when your secret threatens everything, everyone around you.

759
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,550
Sherloque, stop it.

760
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,250
Maybe start at the beginning.

761
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,810
It's a very good place to start.

762
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,640
When you first time-traveled.

763
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,800
So careful to leave the lightest footprint.

764
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,940
Until you suddenly change course

765
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,980
and brazenly interfere with the Thinker satellite

766
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,270
as it crashed to Earth.

767
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,990
I think to myself, "Nope, nope.

768
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:16,820
This excessive action doesn't make sense."

769
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,110
Until you understand that...

770
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,160
it wasn't your idea.

771
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,540
Please stop.

772
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,800
Someone instructed you to do it.

773
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,420
- Stop. - Someone...

774
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,170
whose handwriting is in your journal.

776
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,020
Someone who wrote, "The timeline is malleable."

779
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,560
Same person who's been directing you all this time,

782
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,100
making puppets of all of us

783
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,110
as he seeks to alter the timeline

784
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,180
to suit his own purpose.

785
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,600
Eobard Thawne.

786
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,230
The Reverse-Flash. Your teacher.

787
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:58,780
Your partner.

788
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,570
Your secret.

789
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,280
Nora?

790
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,370
Please tell us this isn't true.

791
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,040
She can't.

792
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,800
- Dad... - Because it is true.

793
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,260
Mom?

794
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,180
I wanted to tell you.

795
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,510
I-I tried to tell you.

796
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,270
Dad.

797
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,770
Dad, please!

798
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,650
Dad!

799
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,400
I'm sorry I lied to you!

800
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,120
So am I.

801
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,290
Dad...
