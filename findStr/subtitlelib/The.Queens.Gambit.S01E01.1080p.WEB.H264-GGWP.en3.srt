00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,291
Mademoiselle Harmon, vous êtes là?

[knocking continues]

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:16,500
Mademoiselle?

-Mademoiselle?
-[knocking]

8
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,583
I'm coming.

9
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,000
Jesus.

10
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:33,125
-[objects clattering]
-[cries out] Shit!

11
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,416

[panting]

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,958
Je descends, tout de suite.

14
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah.

15
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:39,916
[door slams]

-[panting]

18
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:48,958
Fuck!

00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,625

26
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:36,333
Je vous en prie.

[elevator bell dings]

31
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:51,083
Thank you.

36
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:29,500
I'm sorry.

[gentle piano music playing]

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,041
[man 1]
What are we supposed to do with her?

41
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,625
[man 2] They're sending someone.

42
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,875
[man 1] There's hardly a scratch on her.

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,916
It's a goddamn miracle.

44
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,541
I doubt she'll see it that way.

45
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:16,625
[somber music playing]

46
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,083
[matron] You understand, dear,
your mother's passed on?

47
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,166
You know what that means, don't you?

48
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,250
"Passed on"?

49
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,625
Well…

50
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,833
I'm sure she's gone on to a better place,

51
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
and, someday, you'll get to see her again.

52
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,833
[woman] "Orphaned by
yesterday's collision on New Circle Road,

53
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,250
Elizabeth Harmon
surveys a troubled future."

54
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:18,166
"Elizabeth, nine years old,
was left without family by the crash."

55
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:22,166
"Her mother, Alice Harmon,
was pronounced dead at the scene."

56
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,000
[man] And the father?

57
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:34,916
Doesn't say.

58
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:40,250
I would guess that,
like most men who live around there,

59
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,041
he was yet another victim
of a carefree life.

60
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,541
[sighs] Poor dear.

61
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,125
[car horn honks]

62
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,041
Let's welcome her, shall we?

63
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,125
[woman] Welcome, Elizabeth.

64
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,916
Good luck to you, dear.

65
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,583
Here we are.

66
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,000
[indistinct conversations]

67
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:38,250
This is our chapel,
the domain of Miss Lonsdale.

68
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,583
How do you do, Elizabeth?

69
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,916
I also teach etiquette
to the young ladies.

70
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,833
Mr. Fergussen, this is Elizabeth Harmon.

71
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:51,375
[young woman, shouting]
You're all a bunch of fucking cocksuckers!

72
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,541
Jolene.

73
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,125
I got it.

74
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:57,250
Jolene, that mouth
will be the death of you!

75
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,541
-[Jolene] Oh, fuck you, you cocksucker.
-[Fergussen] You can't yell like that.

76
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:04,041
In there is our classroom.
You'll meet your teachers on Monday.

77
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,250
[teacher] Two times six.

78
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,166
And this is our day room,
where you will have all your meals,

79
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,541
and enjoy daily socialization.

80
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,958
[both, in unison]
Good morning, Mrs. Deardorff.

81
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,083
Good morning, girls.

82
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,458
Home sweet home.

83
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,791
Come on, let's get you settled.

84
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:25,208
We have 21 girls here,
and they are all just as sweet as you.

85
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:31,541
And here is your special place.

86
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,500
[toilet flushes]

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,666
-Shoo! Go, go, go.
-[girl] Okay.

88
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,833
You can put your clothes down here.

89
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:45,208
And your toothbrush can go right here.

90
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,375
And any other personal items, there.

91
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,083
Oh!

92
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,625
Show her to me.

93
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,625
Come on, sit.

94
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:08,500
I know that, at this moment,
all you're feeling is loss.

95
00:07:10,416 --> 00:07:14,458
But after grief brings you low,
prayer and faith will lift you high.

96
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,208
High enough for you
to see a new path for yourself.

97
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,500
I think, Elizabeth,

98
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,958
you're going to find
a much different life here.

99
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,458
A better one than you might have had.

100
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:31,541
And I'm sure that you and I
are going to be good friends.

101
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,833
[gentle piano music playing]

102
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,458
[scissors snipping]

103
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,250
[Deardorff] Hmm.

104
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,791
That should do nicely.

105
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,791
Mm-hmm.

106
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,291
I think we'll burn this one.

107
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,166
Get dressed.

108
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,958
We have one more stop.

109
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,708
Mr. Fergussen will take good care of you.
I'll see you at dinner.

110
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,583
The green ones are the best.

111
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,583
What are they?

112
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,666
Vitamins.

113
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,625
-Magic vitamins.
-[laughs]

114
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,416
I were you, I'd save
the green ones up for the night time.

115
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,916
Otherwise, they turn off
right when you need them to turn on.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,958
If you know what I mean.
[chuckles]

117
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,083
Hey, what's your name, girl?

118
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,333
-Beth.
-Jolene.

119
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,416
Your mama and daddy dead?

120
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,833
What's the last thing
they said to you before they died?

121
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,375
I ask everybody that.
We get some really fun answers.

122
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,416
Close your eyes.

123
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,041
I don't remember.

124
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,708
Someday, you might.
If you do, you let me know.

125
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,166
[cup clatters]

126
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,250
[Fergussen]
Green's to even your disposition.

127
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:38,541
Orange and brown is for building
a strong body. Take 'em both.

128
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:41,416
[pills clatter]

129

00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,083
[Jolene snickers]

136
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:53,833
I thought I told you to wait
and take those vitamins at bedtime.

137
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,208
What is this?

138
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,125
Fish.

139
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,125
[Jolene] Far as we know.

140
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,041
We eat it every Friday.

141
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,541
You gotta eat every bite,

142
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,125
or they'll tell Mrs. Deardorff about you,
and you won't get adopted.

143
00:11:20,625 --> 00:11:22,625
[wind whistling]

00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,416
[distant knocking on door]

145
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,333
[man] Alice, come on, open the door.

146
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,583
-It's taken me a whole month to find you.
-[Alice] Good reason.

147
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,000
Whatever this is, whatever you're doing,

148
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:05,125
it's nuts, even for you.

149
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:08,333
-I don't expect you to understand--
-What I understand

150
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,875
is you're not taking care of yourself.

151
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:21,833
[Alice] So, we'll take…

152
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,208
-[fire crackling]
-[nocturnal chirping]

153
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,541
[loud clatter]

154
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,750
Isn't it beautiful?

155
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,166
[wind whistling]

156
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,625
[man] Let me come in and talk to Lizzie.
Make sure she's okay.

157
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,250
[Alice] Oh, you think I'd hurt her?

158
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,666
She's happy here.
This is where she belongs.

159
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,708
You honestly believe our daughter
belongs in a trailer

160
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,291
in the middle of nowhere?

161
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,250
Who says she's ours?

162
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:54,125
-Don't do that, Alice.
-And she doesn't like being called Lizzie.

163
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,208
[door slams]

164

[objects clattering]

166
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:19,625
[man] All right, Alice, you win.

167
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,958
I can't fight with you anymore.

168
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,958
And I can't keep chasing you
around everywhere,

169
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,708
if all you do is run away again.

170
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,791
[Alice] I'm sorry, Paul.

171
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,625
[Paul]
Once I drive away, I'm not coming back.

172

[teacher clears throat]

176
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,916
Miss Harmon, finished already?

177
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,083
Why don't you take the erasers
down to the basement and clean them?

178
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:32,041
[Jolene] You're all fucking cocksuckers,
and you're the biggest one of them all.

179
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,250
Never met anyone who liked

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,833
I won't.

360
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,250
Modern Chess Openings.

361
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:23,041
It's the best book for you.

362
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,916
It will tell you all you wanna know.

363
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:29,458
You'll need to learn chess notation
before you can read it.

364
00:34:30,416 --> 00:34:32,083
The names of the squares.

365
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,333
I'll teach you now.

366
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,625
Am I good enough now?

367
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:38,416
How old are you?

368
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,583
Nine.

369
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:42,541
Nine years old.

370
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,916
I'll be ten in November.

371
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,291
To tell you the truth of it, child…

372
00:34:52,333 --> 00:34:53,291
you're astounding.

373
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:54,958
[warm orchestral music playing]

374
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,291
[man] "Nobody heard him,

375
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,541
the dead man,

376
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,250
but still he lay moaning."

377
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,625
"I was much further out than you thought,

378
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,916
and not waving but drowning."

379
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:09,916
"Poor chap,

380
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:13,208
he always loved larking, and now…

381
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,458
he's dead."

382
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:21,833
"It must have been too cold for him.
His heart gave way, they said."

383
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:24,250
"Oh, no, no, no,

384
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,250
it was too cold always."

385
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:30,541
"Still, the dead one lay moaning."

386
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:34,166
"I was much too far out all my life,

387
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,958
and not waving, but drowning."

388
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:51,000
This is Mr. Ganz from the chess club.

389
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,666
-Chess club?
-[custodian] We play at a club.

390
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,208
[Mr. Ganz]
I'm also coach of the high school team.

391
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:58,166
Duncan High?

392
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,583
Would you like to play me a game?

393
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,750
[chess pieces clatter softly]

394
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,166
You play the color you choose.

395
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:22,708
This one.

396
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:30,541
Ah, the Réti Opening.

397
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:36,666
[chess pieces clattering softly]

398
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,833
That's mate in three.

399
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:22,500
[Mr. Ganz] Well, you certainly
know the game, young lady.

400
00:37:23,416 --> 00:37:24,625
Do you have a team here?

401
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:28,333
The other girls,
do they have a chess club?

402
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,208
So, where do you play?

403
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,666
Down here.

404
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,708
Mr. Shaibel said
you play a few games every Sunday.

405
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,916
What do you do in between?

406
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:41,958
I play in my head.

407
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:44,708
In your head?

408
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:46,625
On the ceiling.

409
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,000
[Mr. Ganz] Oh…

410
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,000
before I forget…

411
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,125
I brought you…

412
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:57,625
a present.

413
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:01,958
Go ahead, open it.

414
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,833
[paper crinkles]

415
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,750
[Mr. Ganz chuckles]

416
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,041
Well?

417
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,166
Thank you very much.

418
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:23,916
Do you want another game?

419
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,041
[pensive music playing]

420
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,041
[Beth] Check.

421
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:35,791
[Beth sighs]

422
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:58,250
[sighs]

423
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,458
Beth…

424
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:04,416
I've moved my queen to rook four.

425
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,125
Check.

426
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,666
The bishop blocks.

427
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,333
Queen takes king's pawn.

428
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,708
Castles.

429
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:24,416
Knight takes knight.

430
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:28,458
Mate in three.

431
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,166
First check is with the queen.

432
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,916
The king must take.

433
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,500
Then, the bishop checks on knight five…

434
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,875
and it's mate next.

435
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,666
Sweet Jesus.

436
00:39:50,458 --> 00:39:51,458
I have to go now.

437
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,500
Would you mind, Beth…

438
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,000
if I took your picture?

439
00:39:57,708 --> 00:40:00,166
I'd love to tell
the kids in chess club about you.

440
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,416
How about you stand next to Mr. Shaibel?

441
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,708
Closer.

442
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,875
[film loading]

443
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:21,875
[Mr. Ganz] That's it.

444
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:23,750
Say queen!

445
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,833
Queen.

446
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,208
[teacher] Nine times four is?

447
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:37,041
-[doll thuds]
-[lid crashes shut]

448
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,708
[film reeling]

449
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,041
[cheerful music plays on film]

450
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:42,916
[man on film] Hiya, Marge.

451
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,375
[Marge] Hi, I'm sorry I'm late,
but I ran into Jean, here.

452
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:48,750
Oh, Jean, this is Ed Reardon.
The Ed I was telling you about.

453
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:49,875
-Hello.
-How do you do?

454
00:40:49,958 --> 00:40:51,750
And this is Jack Connors.

455
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:54,625
-Jean Bassett, from over at Morrisville.
-How do you do, Jean?

456
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:56,666
-[Jean] Hello.
-Here, you can sit here.

457
00:40:58,166 --> 00:40:59,833
-[Jean] Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

458
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,750
-Would you like something? Malt or soda?
-Hey, Mrs. Deardorff wants to see you.

459
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,291
[narrator in film]
A well-mannered group, I think.

460
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:09,583
You notice their good manners right away.

461
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,833
Mr. Ganz tells me
that you are a gifted child.

462
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,250
He has an unusual request to make.

463
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,458
He would like you
to be taken to the high school on…

464
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,000
-On Thursday.
-On Thursday.

465
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:23,083
In the afternoon.

466
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:27,041
He maintains
that you are a phenomenal chess player.

467
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:30,666
He would like you
to perform for the chess club.

468
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,875
We have a dozen members,
and I was suggesting to Mrs. Deardorff

469
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:40,208
that you come along
and play all of them in a simultaneous.

470
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:41,916
In a what?

471
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,291
At the same time.

472
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,291
We like to give our girls a chance

473
00:41:47,375 --> 00:41:50,458
for experience outside
whenever we can, but…

474
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:55,333
I'm a bit wary of letting Elizabeth
go off to the local high school.

475
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:57,083
Oh, well, I would chaperone.

476
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:59,625
I'd pick her up, take her to the school,
then bring her back.

477
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:02,666
I was thinking a young lady
might also accompany her.

478
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,541
Well, I assumed that you would come,

479
00:42:06,208 --> 00:42:07,458
as my guest.

480
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:09,083
Oh. [laughs]

481
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:10,875
No, I…

482
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,958
[inhales] I couldn't possibly
abandon my duties here.

483
00:42:14,833 --> 00:42:16,958
[Mr. Ganz]
Well, what if Shirley Munson,

484
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:19,416
club treasurer
and one of my best students,

485
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,583
she comes along?

486
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,208
What do you say, Elizabeth?

487
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,083
Do you want to play chess
at the high school?

488
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,416
Yes, I'd like to.

489
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,083
Okay.

490
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,958
It's settled, then.

491
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,750
Mr. Ganz and, uh…

492
00:42:38,583 --> 00:42:39,708
-Charlotte?
-Shirley.

493
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:40,666
Shirley, yes.

494
00:42:41,666 --> 00:42:44,916
They will pick you up,
let's say after lunch on Thursday?

495
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,833
Perfect.

496
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,166
I'll see you then.

497
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:00,833
[Deardorff] Elizabeth.

498
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:05,541
I'm told that you've been playing chess
with our custodian.

499
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,625
With Mr. Shaibel.

500
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:09,916
Yes, ma'am.

501
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:13,625
This is very irregular, Elizabeth.

502
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,041
Have you gone to the basement?

503
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,125
Yes, ma'am.

504
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,458
Well, we can't have that.

505
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,750
As much as Methuen believes in excellence,

506
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:26,208
we can't have you
playing chess in the basement.

507
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:27,333
[phone ringing]

508
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,166
[sighs]

509
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:33,125
I believe that we have chess sets
in the game closet.

510
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:36,041
I'll have Fergussen look into that.

511
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:38,708
-[phone continues ringing]
-That'll be all, Elizabeth.

512
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,083
Mind your manners at the high school.

513
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:42,750
-[receiver picks up]
-Helen Deardorff.

514
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:48,500
-There's one missing.
-[Fergussen] That's it.

515
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,833
Next.

516
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:52,125
It's my turn, Harmon.

517
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Where are the green ones?

518
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:55,541
You don't get them anymore.

519
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,416
There they are, right behind you.

520
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,791
I know where they are, Harmon,
but I'm not gonna give you any.

521
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:04,541
New state law.
No more tranquilizers for kids.

522
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,375
-Go figure.
-Harmon.

523
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:08,666
"Go thou further off."

524
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,416
"Bid me farewell,
and let me hear thee going."

525
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:14,250
-What?
-Beat it.

526
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,000
[Beth sighs]

527
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,666
[uneasy music playing]

528
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,958
[Beth]
Did Fergussen give you any green pills?

529
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,875
Extra ones?

530
00:45:09,958 --> 00:45:11,791
No, honey, I wish he would.

531
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,416
But they got the state after them

532
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,583
for what they've been doing
with those pills.

533
00:45:17,333 --> 00:45:18,333
They're still there.

534
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,541
In the big jar.

535
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,458
That a fact?

536
00:45:23,375 --> 00:45:24,375
I ain't noticed.

537
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,583
You're having withdrawal symptoms?

They left backward pawns
all over the place,
