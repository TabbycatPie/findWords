254
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,430
也许我刚刚用手机 上网查了一下

255
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,130
也许不是噢
Then again, maybe not.

256
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,940
那么说Victoria马上要结婚了

260
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,980
我觉得这事 迟早会发生
You thought something was gonna happen.

261
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,530
大概有百分之一的机率
Like one percent.

262
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,530
下次记得戴上戒指
Maybe slap on a ring next time.

263
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,600
但问题是 他还没向我求婚
Well, the problem is, he hasn't asked me yet.

264
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,270
我在一个袜子柜的盒子里 找到了一个戒指.
I found the ring in a box in his sock drawer.

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,380
他要带我去
He's taking me out

270
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,950
一家在Hamptons的非常好的旅馆
to a really nice restaurant out in the Hamptons.

271
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,810
旅馆就建在水上
It's right on the water,

272
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,630
所以在我们漫步在沙滩 沐浴在月光之中
so afterwards we'll take a walk on the beach in the moonlight.

273
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,460
你也许该离开了
You should probably go.

274
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,530
我不懂诶 听起来是个不错的暗示
I don't know. It sounds pretty intimate.

275
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,780
(尴尬的笑)

276
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,970
我是认真的，我觉得我让你误会了
I'm serious. I feel like I misled you.

277

女士，我过来是帮你洗盘子的
Madam, I came here to wash your dishes.

278
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,610
没别的了
Nothing more.

279
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,310
- Whoa!刚才那是什么？！ - 什么是什么？
- Whoa! What was that!? - What was what?

280
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,000
这人和Barney 刚才对了个眼！
This guy and Barney just shared a look!

281
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,280
你认识他么?
Do you know him?

282
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,040
又来了！
They did it again!

283
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,040
整个事情就是个阴谋 绝对的！
This whole thing stinks, I tells ya!

284
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,490
阴谋！
It stinks!

285
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,680
Lily,你是在说Barney 花了六个月
Lily, are you really suggesting that Barney spent six months

286
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,100
为了学习一个他更本就不喜欢的烹饪招式而
commuting back and forth to Hoboken

287
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,580
在纽约和Hoboken之间折返
to learn a signature cooking style of a restaurant

288
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,150
仅仅是为了赢一场打赌
he doesn't even like so he could win a bet

289
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,850
甚至这打赌当时还根本不存在
he hadn't even made yet?

290
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
对的，整个事情就是个阴谋！
Yeah, the whole thing stinks.

291
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,110
不，这根本不可能
No, it's not possible, okay?

292
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,180
是我提议去Shinjitsu...
I was the one who said let's go to Shinjitsu...

293
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,780
(Barney打喷嚏) 注意身体
Bless you.

294
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,950
Barney怎么可能...
How could Barney have...

295
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,820
你这个天才的混蛋
You brilliant bastard.

296
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,540
这太明显了...
It's all so obvious now.

297
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,790
迄今为止， 我忘了，大概五年
For the past, oh, I don't know how long, five years,

298
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,830
每一次我说出，我们去"Shinjitsu"吧
every time I've said, "Let's go to Shinjitsu""

299
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,910
注意身体
Bless you.

300
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,050
你就会打喷嚏
You've sneezed.

301
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,360
每一次
Every time.

302
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,950
MARSHALL: <i>一点又一点</i>
<i>And little by little...</i>

303
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,580
咱们去Shinjitsu.
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

304
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,540
注意身体
Bless you. Bless you.

305
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,710
<i>...在我脑海之中</i> <i>.你嵌入了这个遐想</i>
<i>...you forged the association</i> <i>in my brain.</i>

306
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,020
那么我们去哪里吃饭
So what should we do for dinner?

307
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,540
我们去Shinjitsu. (喷嚏)
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

308
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,810
噢，注意身体， 谢谢
Oh, bless you. Thanks.

309
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,730
MARSHALL: <i>直到最终...</i>
<i>Until eventually...</i>

310
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,180
是的，我是说过 我们周日才回来
Yes, I know I said that we'd be back Sunday,

311
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,980
但是那又怎么样 我们现在已经回来了
but guess what? We are back now!

312
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,050
现在到底...
Now what on earth...

313
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,440
别跳了 你到底...
Stop bouncing! What on earth

314
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,220
怎么想的 觉得我们会同意这个！
would make you think that we'd be okay with this?

315
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,010
咱们去Shinjitsu吧.
Let's go to Shinjitsu.

316
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,910
去年你每感冒一次
When you were sick for a week last year,

317
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,190
我们就去Shinjitsu 去了六次
I had Shinjitsu like six times.

318
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,280
你的确有这刀法...
You had the knife skills...

319
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,870
你握有把柄...
you had the trigger...

320
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,120
你所等待的 就是想要从我这里获得什么
All you needed then was to want something from me.

321
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,170
直到有一天 你想要的东西出现了
And then one day... those somethings came a-busting out.

322
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,290
Wapowng!
Wapowng!

323
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,290
我要带着这样的念头生活
I am gonna have to walk this earth,

324
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,410
Barney要摸我的胸部
knowing Barney has touched my boobs.

325
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
是的，这个念头会伴随你
Yeah. It stays with you.

326
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,090
更别提他会用email来提醒你
His email reminders don't help.

327
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,800
Okay, Lily, 这太荒谬了
Okay, Lily, this is ridiculous.

328
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,560
如果你要取消 这个打赌的话
If you want to call the bet off...

329
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,770
太好了，打赌取消
Great! The bet's off!

330
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,320
让我说完
Let me finish.

331
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,930
条件是这样的:假如你同意让我看他们--
If you let me just see them--

332
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:39,110
不摸，仅仅是看-- 一分钟...
no touching, just looking-- for one minute...

333
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,650
30秒 好吧，30秒
30 seconds. For 30 seconds,

334
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,100
在一个亮堂堂的摄影室里
in a well-lit photography studio...

335
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,900
- 在小胡同里 - 在小胡同里...
- In the alley. - In the alley...

336
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,490
我们就彻底取消 这场赌约
then we'll cancel this entire wager completely.

337
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,820
成交么？
Do we have a deal?

338
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,740
我觉得你应该跟他成交
I totally think you should take the deal.

339
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,280
MARSHALL: 我不知道，我觉得我们还有机会
I don't think we have a choice.

340
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,460
我同意这场交易
Go on, take the deal.

341
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,580
好吧，我会认真考虑一下的
I'll... think about it.

342
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,000
那么你洗完盘子
So you're doing the dishes...

343
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,340
我洗完了盘子
I'm doing the dishes.

344
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,390
都搞定了
All done.

345
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,670
谢谢你！
Congratulations.

346
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,120
你的业报终于了结了 带着淡淡的柠檬香
Your karmic slate is clean and lemony fresh.

347
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,130
- 干杯. - 干杯.
- Cheers. - Cheers.

348
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,480
我终于可以重新开始

满心期待的憧憬 你和他...

请问他的名字是？

00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,860
你在德国生活的时候
When you were living in Germany,

357
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,000
我们在坚持着异地恋...
and we were doing the whole long-distance thing...

358

00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,500
- 不不，我没有 - Mm.

在我们分手之后
After we broke up, how long were you single

我了个去，您老不是在开玩笑吧!
Oh, you have got to be kidding me!

对不起
I'm sorry.

376
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,960
我花了六年的时间 来谴责自己

因为我背叛了你 结果你...
I completely betrayed you, when in truth, you...

378
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,880
好吧，是你逼我的
No, you know what?

379
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,380
(吐槽：好恶心)

380
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,870
我去
Okay. Fine.

381
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,640
就让你自己免于良心的谴责吧
Just let yourself off the hook on a technicality!

382
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,840
别忘了，是你先背叛我的

我怎么能忘 我永远不会忘

我仅仅... 我希望我对你也意味着一些东西
I just... I wish it had meant something to you, too.

387
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,550
你开玩笑么？
Are you kidding?

388
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,620

那个游戏之夜
Game night.

在那之后我们又玩了几次 但是我一直都学不会

你有一个可笑的想法
You had this ridiculous idea

你觉得亲你之前的那一个时刻...
that the moment leading up to the kiss...

402
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,300
那个等待..
The drum roll.

403
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,630
...就跟亲吻本身一样的美妙
...is as good as the kiss itself.

404
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,220
难道不是么
Isn't it?

405
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,140
这时刻更加的纯真
Well, it's certainly more innocent.

406
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,520
彻底的无瑕
It's completely harmless.

407
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,390
彻底的

你看 我是惟一一个

快点, Lily, 快脱吧
Come on, Lily, hurry up.

428
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,640
哥们儿们...
Guys...

429
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,760
我是这场赌局的见证人，但是谁邀请了Takumi?
You know, I'm all for honoring a bet, but who invited Takumi?

430

你看不出来么?
Don't you see?

444
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,350
他计划这个很久了！
This was his plan all along!

445

451
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,730
干的不错
Nice try.

452
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,940
（放荡的大小）

453
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,280
(Barney帅呆了，有木有！！！)

454
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,930
也许我错了
Maybe I was wrong.

455
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,340
我觉得我已经完成了你们要让我做的事了?
Well, I guess that's everything you asked me to do, is it not?

456
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,760
噢，等等! 让虾飞入口袋.
Oh, wait! The shrimp in the pocket.

457
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,010
经典中的经典
A modern classic.

458
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,040
现在...
And now...

459
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,890
在二垒上整整一分钟...
for one minute on second base...

460
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,810
坚挺又下流的挤压...
with a firm yet sensual squeeze...

461
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,450
没什么能阻止他了
Nothing can stop him now.

462
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,120
只有一件可以！
One thing can.

463

实际上是两件
Make that two things.

464
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,170
不！
No!!

465
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,680
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

466
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,550
那么你们去巴士那边...
So you take her to the bus...

467
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,210
我带她去坐巴士
I take her to the bus.

468
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,100
场景何其相似
Well, this feels familiar.

469
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,300
你要离开 希望我说"不要走"
You leaving, me kind of wanting to say, "Don't go""

470
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,690
现在有点迟了
Little late for that.

471
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,690
是有点
Little bit.

472
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,640
- 不要走 - Ted...
- Don't go. - Ted...

473
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,390
对不起，有点失态...
I'm sorry. I just...

474
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,200
我为什么那时候不说出来
Why didn't I say it then?

475
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,950
为什么我要让你上飞机？
Why'd I let you get on that plane?

476
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,890
为什么我不跟你一起走？
Why didn't I get on it with you?

477
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,460
要是我们现在生活在一起，要是我们能...
What would our lives be right now, if we had just...

478
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,910
Hold住?
held on?

479
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,360
我还会在今晚的宴会上遇到你么...
Would I have still run into you at this party tonight...

480
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,330
或者 我们今夜会出现在这里么?
or would we have been there together?

481
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,500
我们携手归家...
We'd go home...

482
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,870
归我们的家?
to our home?

483
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,420
你做饭来我洗碗
You cook. I do the dishes.

484
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,140
我快乐因为你快乐
I'm happy that you're happy.

485
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,230
但，现实太悲摧了
But damn it.

486
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,480
要是？
What if?

487
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,100
你是不是想听这个问题的答案？
Do you really want to know the answer to that?

488
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,270
不
No.

489
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,220
我觉得这个答案会让我难过
I think it would kill me.

490
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,890
再见，Ted.
Good-bye, Ted.

491
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,400
故事结束了
And that was it.

492
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,260
现在她大概订婚了
Now she's probably engaged.

493
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,580
也许这是最好的结局了
Maybe it's for the best.

494
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,430
好了，现在...
All right. Well...

495
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,320
我们要出去了鸭
We're gonna duck out.

496
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,100
不好意思要让你买单了
Sorry to leave you with the bill.

497
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:55,610
噢，弟兄们 这会是美好的一年啊！
Oh, guys, it's gonna be a good year.

498
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,150
我很高兴你们开心
I'm glad you guys can laugh,

499
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,150
因为我觉得我又要生病了
'cause I think I'm gonna be physically ill.

500
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,730
变得跟只绿头鸭一样?
Coming down with a mallardy?

501
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,980
噢，他们看起来饿了
Oh, they look hungry. There you go.

502
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,620
来开饭了～
Here you go.

503
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,290
NARRATOR: <i>孩子们实际上</i> <i>我忽略了故事的一部分</i>
<i>Kids, there was</i> <i>one part I left out.</i>

504
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,290
再见， Ted.
Good-bye, Ted.

505
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,610
好吧，答案究竟是什么?
Okay, yes. What's the answer?

506
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:23,140
因为一个原因， 所以我们永远不会在一起
There is a reason that it didn't work out between you and me,

507
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,090
不是因为异地恋
but it's not Germany.

508
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,710
我打赌这个原因
And I'm willing to bet it's the same reason none of your other

509
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,130
也是你这六年一直单身的原因
relationships in the last six years have lasted either.

510
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,480
是Robin.
It's Robin.

511
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,680
不
No.

512
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,100
是的
Yes.

513
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
她对你的影响 远远大于你所认知的
She is so much bigger in your world than you realize.

514
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,660
而你现在的所做 你，Robin和Barney
And this thing that you're all doing, you and Barney and Robin,

515
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:44,940
你们三人一起在酒吧玩 泡夜店
where the three of you hang out at the bar night in, night out,

516
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,830
你们之间仅仅是哥们儿关系么?
like you're all just buddies?

517
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,410
没那么简单，相信我
That doesn't work. Trust me.

518
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,410
你肯定错了
You-You've got it all wrong.

519
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,130
我肯定对了
I'm right about this.

520
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,840
再见, Ted.
Good-bye, Ted.

521
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,150
NARRATOR: 事实表明, <i>她的确是对的.</i>
And sure enough, <i>she was right.</i>

522
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,570
<i>的确没那么简单;</i> <i>只是我当时不愿意承认罢了</i>
<i>It didn't work;</i> <i>we just didn't realize it yet.</i>
