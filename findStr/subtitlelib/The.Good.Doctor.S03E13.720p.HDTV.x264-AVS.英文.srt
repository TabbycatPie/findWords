18
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,270
Someone had a good night.

19
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,070
Do you think all of these people have had sex?

20
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,240
And if so, shouldn't they be more happy?

21
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,770
Maybe their experiences weren't as recent as yours.

22
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,500
I think about sex with everyone.

23
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,950
But mostly with Carly.

24
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,240
She and I are very compatible.

25
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,510
That's great, Shaun, but HR might not approve.

26
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,040
About me thinking of sex?

27
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,790
No, about saying you're thinking about sex.

28
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,560
And stop it.

29
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,310
Smiling while talking to a dying man is not cool.

30
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,510
Dr. Blaize recommended we speak to you

31
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,730
about a permanent port.

32
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,820
It would simplify your chemo sessions.

33
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,190
No more hunting for a vein every time.

34
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,020
Anything to help with the nausea?

35
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,530
It's a normal side effect.

36
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,900
Anything you can do for the exhaustion?

37
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,770
Anything...

38
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,090
so that my muscles don't ache?

39
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,100
But you can keep me from being stuck by a needle.

40
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,460
They're just trying to help.

41
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,120
I know.

42
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,140
All the doctors are trying to help.

43
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,920
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,650
Thank you.

45
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,830
But I-I don't need the port.

46
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,610
And I don't need any more chemo.

47
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,820
Of course you do.

48
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,850
It's going to give you more time.

49
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,090
Honey, I'm miserable.

50
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,130
Cerebral cavernous malformations.

51
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,920
Leads to bleeding, clots, seizures, muscle weakness,

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,260
even paralysis.

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,490
You have clusters of them.

54
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,130
And they're getting worse.

55
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,020
The woman at Hopkins gave me a year.

56
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,790
Mass General, two years.

57
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,530
So, what, you figured I'd give you three?

58
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,520
Some new treatment?

59
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,080
You know the treatment, Caroline -- a lobectomy.

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,720
I love the way surgeons blithely suggest

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,360
cutting through my cerebral cortex

62
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,020
to remove part of my brain.

63
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,740
Why not just take an egg slicer to my ability to paint?

64
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,560
Yes, it will likely lead to a curtailment

65
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,300
of your ability to be creative,

66
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,810
but all of your other faculties will remain intact.

67
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,700
I had a severe prognosis of my own recently.

68
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,240
Surgery, chemo, radiation, the works.

69
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,770
My greatest fear wasn't at the edges of the spectrum.

70
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,030
It wasn't life or death.

71
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,040
My greatest fear

72
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,440
was survival as something lesser.

73
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,350
Then you know.

74
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,600
And then I had a revelation of sorts.

75
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,400
Who I am, how I think of myself

76
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,020
isn't defined by my skill as a surgeon.

77
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,270
Uh, I'm seeing you as a courtesy.

78
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,450
I don't do this anymore.

79
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,590
And guess what? I'm fine.

80
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,390
I'm happier.

81
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,550
You could have 20, 30 more years

82
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,660
with your family.

83
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,040
A balanced life isn't necessarily a lesser life.

84
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,990
I disagree.

85
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,700
20 bucks says Shaun mentions sex

86
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,030
in front of a patient in the next 24 hours.

87
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,010
He's excited.

88
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,360
I'm sure you were when a new world opened up.

89
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,260
But he knows better.

90
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,030
- 20 bucks. - No.

91
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,580
Morgan.

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,990
Oh, I was hoping I'd see you.

93
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,950
Hello.

94
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,520
Perfect.

95
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,650
I was just wondering where to get lunch around here.

96
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,510
Any genre, as long as it's locally sourced.

97
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,580
Is this a friend?

98
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,710
I'm Caroline Reznick.

99
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,770
My mother.

100
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,210
What are you doing here?

101
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,480
What beautiful eyes.

102
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,740
I hope...

103
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,720
s-someone...

104
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,230
p-paint...

105
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,110
Mom!

106
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,890
Mom? Mom.

107
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,280
Mom, can you hear me?

108
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,580
Code blue. We need a crash cart.

111
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,440
I've come to take you to lunch.

112
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,190
It's only 11:15.

113
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,410
M-Morgan told me

114
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,530
that it might be considered unprofessional

115
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,940
to discuss sex on the job.

116
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,340
So, when you say "Lunch"...

117
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,350
It's sex.

118
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,580
I am expected to be here working.

119
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,530
People in the Pathology Lab

120
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,760
take two 15-minute breaks on their shift.

121
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,060
If they were combined into one

122
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,680
and we used the bus that stops out front at 11:25,

123
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,040
with one returning at 12:15,

124
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,620
and we borrowed some of your lunch hour --

125
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,250
you only require 22 minutes to eat a sandwich --

126
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,820
there would be just enough time

127
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,520
to get to your apartment and back.

128
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,010
Have you noticed the time you've allotted for "Lunch"

129
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,550
is fairly short?

130
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,900
Long enough.

131
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,130
Long enough for you, not for me.

132
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,350
You've only had sex once in your life.

133
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,480
No one expects you to win awards,

134
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,170
and it was lovely sharing the moment.

135
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,790
Are you implying the sex could be improved on?

136
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:04,160
Yes.

137
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,350
Does that bother you?

138
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,280
No.

139
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,340
I have no objection to improving sex.

140
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,010
Although, I thought it was already excellent.

141
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,870
I'll work on it.

142
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,770
Found the source of the bleed.

143
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,590
Suctioning and evacuating the clot cavity.

144
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,780
The Cav Mals are everywhere.

145
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,850
She could have a massive bleed at any time.

146
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,370
I thought Morgan's parents were doctors.

147
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,000
- I heard that, too. - Why would Morgan let us think

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,680
Maybe you should save the speculation

149
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,750
until your hands aren't in my mother's skull.

150
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,310
Use your inside voice, Morgan.

151
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,600
Turn down the volume.

152
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,130
Irrigate and remove the cottonoid.

153
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,060
Why didn't she tell us she was one of those Reznicks?

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,390
Caroline Reznick, painter.

155
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,500
Her son's a sculptor. Daughter's a composer.

156
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,180
Didn't know she had another kid.

157
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,750
They're famous, if you're into the arts at all.

158
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,210
Mia got you going to galleries?

159
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,520
Yeah, I'm kind of loving it.

160
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,350
I've failed Carly twice.

161
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,410
Did you forget her birthday or stand her up?

162
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,220
Are you talking about sex?

163
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,810
Morgan says H.R. would prefer I avoid that word.

164
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,660
Just to be clear, are you saying she...

165
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,830
Are you saying she didn't --

166
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,990
There was no parade.

167
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,960
There was a parade for me,

168
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,350
but there was no parade for Carly.

169
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,700
I want to give her a parade.

170
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll continue reading.

171
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait, Shaun, reading's a great start,

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,990
but Carly's a person.

173
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,000
You need to communicate with her, ask her what she likes.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,160
Yes. I'll make an extensive list of questions.

175
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,620
It's not just about questions and answers.

176
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,990
Nonverbal communication is pretty key in this area.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,180
I'm not good with nonverbal communication.

178
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,500
Watch her reactions.

179
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,190
See what Carly responds to.

180
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,650
You'll figure this out.

181
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,240
Mrs. Reznick, I'm Dr. Park.

182
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,760
This is Dr. Murphy, Dr. Browne.

183
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,550
How are you feeling?

184
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,440
Excellent.

185
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,590
And flattered that three surgeons

186
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,960
are here to check on me.

187
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,320
They're curious.

188
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,390
About what monster created me.

189
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,810
I'm sure that's not true.

190
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,020
Morgan, you're smart and nice and perfectly normal.

191
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,880
I don't think she's all of those things.

192
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,590
You guys here to take her vitals,

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,990
check her for any deficits,

194
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,790
and maybe let her know

195
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,280
that she's just gonna keep getting worse and die?

196
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,840
Your daughter is right, Mrs. Reznick.

197
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
- If you don't - Dr. Browne, the daylilies

198
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,850
go so well with your eyes.

199
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,890
Please take them.

200
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,420
This variety is from the Himalayas.

201
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,540
Please.

202
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,380
I really am grateful to you all.

203
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm asking other people to take over my cases.

204
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,750
Check your in-box, and you'll see the three I've given you.

205
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,460
In your language, the word "Ask"

206
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,970
must mean something different.

207
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,620
You're a caring, empathetic person,

208
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,250
and my mother is sick.

209
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,780
As long as we're having a moment of honesty...

210
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,750
...why do you hate your family?

211
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,090
You told me your mother was a cardiologist.

212
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,390
No, you told me my mother was a cardiologist.

213
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,450
I can't correct all your mistakes.

214
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,200
Was that the mother you wanted to have?

215
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,830
Cardiac perfusionist, call the cath lab.

216
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,880
I used to daydream my mother was a lawyer.

217
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,490
That's just weird.

218
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,390
I'm Oliver.

219
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,070
I have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor,

220
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,930
so I've only got six months to live.

221
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,020
I'm Dr. Melendez.

222
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,260
What happened to your foot?

223
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,340
Skydiving.

224
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,290
First time.

225
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,720
They coached me how to roll, but it didn't quite work out.

226
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,070
He rented a plane.

227
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,350
A small one.

228
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,170
All the classes were full. I did not want to wait.

229
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,960
You should've come with me.

230
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm afraid of heights.

231
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,410
So was I.

232
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,980
Not anymore.

233
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,690
Nothing's broken.

234
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,060
Ice it tonight.

235
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,780
Try to stay off it for a few days.

236
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,790
I'll give you 12 hours.

237
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,020
Lots to do, so I might be okay with limping.

238
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,810
As long as I'm here,

239
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,390
can I get vaccinated for tropical diseases?

240
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,790
Thinking about moving somewhere

241
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,050
the weather will be perfect for the next six months.

242
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,010
The dry season in Costa Rica is just beginning.

243
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,010
Excellent.

244
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,330
I've always wanted to see Costa Rica.

245
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,290
They have mantled howler monkeys

246
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,500
that make this haunting call at dawn and dusk.

247
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,140
Wouldn't that be great to wake up to?

248
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,830
Oliver...

249
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,470
skydiving doesn't bring happiness.

250
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,730
Neither do monkey howls.

251
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,020
You gonna tell a dying guy he can't do what he wants to do?

252
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:39,980
No.

253
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,590
Get me the shots.

254
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,850
What happened to the patient who was in here?

255
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,150
She checked herself out.

256
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,940
I knew I had to be in early,

257
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,820
so I tried not to wake you.

258
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,050
Appreciate it.

259
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,190
- I've brought you a jelly doughnut and coffee... - Thank you.

260
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,380
...to celebrate last night's breakthrough.

261
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,740
What breakthrough was that?

262
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,540
Last night.

263
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,220
You had a parade.

264
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,340
During lunch.

265
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,920
You made a lot of noise.

266
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,470
One fairly loud noise -- a moan.

267
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,680
Right, right.

268
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,600
You had your elbow on my hair.

269
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,720
I had a great time last night,

270
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,360
and I really appreciate

271
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,980
how much effort you put into my happiness.

272
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,430
But no parade.

273
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,320
Parades aren't always required.

274
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,470
I'll keep working on it.

275
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,550
Cassie, stay in Hong Kong.

276
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,370
It would be ridiculous to miss the premiere of your symphony

277
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,460
because of a medical glitch.

278
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,950
I have to go. Your sister's here. Bye.

279
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,380
You're in time for brunch.

280
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,030
I didn't know where you were staying,

281
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,780
if you'd left town, if you'd gone home.

282
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,860
I finally got your new housekeeper on the phone

283
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,460
and convinced her I was your daughter.

284
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,650
She said you never mentioned me.

285
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh, Blanca's very forgetful.

286
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,950
Pull up a chair.

287
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,430
Your brother's out getting salmon.

288
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,260
- Ariel's here? - He got great news.

289
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,960
Million-dollar commission -- a bronze piece on the mall.

290
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,710
I'm thrilled.

291
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,530
Can we talk about the fact that you're dying?

292
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,180
No.

293
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,810
I'm having a good arthritis day.

294
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,210
Why shouldn't I feel happy?

295
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,300
You're so lucky you didn't inherit anything from me.

296
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,310
Morgan.

297
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,270
I thought Mom ditched the medical police.

298
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,770
Right, the bad guys trying to keep her alive.

299
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,470
We've all tried to get her to change her mind,

300
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,530
but you know what she's like.

301
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,620
I'm using a little sriracha

302
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,410
just to throttle your taste buds.

303
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,070
Thank you.

304
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,950
I've been strategizing with Cassie via e-mail,

305
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,940
trying to figure out a way to convince Mom --

306
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,210
Did it occur to either of you to mention any of this

307
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,190
to the only doctor in the family?

308
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,960
Plenty of doctors already involved.

309
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,200
And you barely consider yourself part of this family.

310
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,110
You exclude me, and it's my fault?

311
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,710
Morgan, in high school, kids kept asking

312
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,480
about my parents, the spies.

313
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,380
And my friend Joel at Georgetown

314
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,930
said you told people your parents were in the Peace Corps.

315
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,860
And that you were an only child.

316
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,910
I got tired of fielding questions about my famous mother.

317
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,080
- It doesn't mean -- - Only child.

318
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,500
You're offended that you weren't in the family

319
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,080
I completely made up?

320
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:47,860
I got tired of hearing "Your mother is so talented.

321
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,510
How wonderful your brother's an artist.

322
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,770
How amazing Cassie writes music.

323
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,820
What do you do?"

324
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,350
Mom!

325
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,230
Grab a towel.

326
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,840
It's not just about what you do physically.

327
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,750
It's about setting a scene, offering inspiration.

328
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,180
I mean, do you know what movies she likes

329
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,980
or what actors she thinks are sexy?

330
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,590
She likes the "Alien" movies.

331
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,790
Something else?

332
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,330
She loves "Outlander."

333
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,190
That is a good idea.

334
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,550
Where the hell is everybody?!

335
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,710
Complex partial seizure.

336
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,370
Cut her finger off with an electric knife.

337
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,790
Knuckle's still there, but we need to get her to an O.R.

338
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,130
No one touches that but the surgeon.

339
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,670
Bloody towels get thrown out all the time.

340
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,890
I'm not dumpster diving while cells die.

341
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,440
The last of the circumferential sutures.

342
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,180
Good capillary refill in the fingertip.

343
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,790
What if this wasn't caused by the Cav Mals?

344
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,370
First the bleeding, then the seizure --

345
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,650
pretty typical progression.

346
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,900
It's also possible the bleeding caused the seizure.

347
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,600
Microbleeds can cause gliosis, and that can cause a seizure.

348
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,620
And if the seizure was caused by gliosis,

349
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,250
we could simply remove that one bit of damaged tissue.

350
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,650
She'd still be terminal, but --

351
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,970
Shaun is right, but he's wrong.

352
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,690
Volume! Volume! Volume!

353
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,270
Shaun's idea could stop the seizures

354
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,750
and let her keep painting for the time she has left.

355
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,590
That's something she'll agree to.

356
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,150
Which is why he's wrong.

357
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,780
If she stops having the seizures,

358
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,870
there's no way she'll have the lobectomy

359
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,200
that will save her life.

360
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
We don't choose procedures in order to manipulate patients.

361
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,500
No, we choose procedures

362
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,780
based on what will have the greatest benefit.

363
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,900
Dr. Melendez, I'd like to excuse myself

364
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,820
to speak with the patient's daughter.

365
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,620
Please.

366
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,740
I know not disclosing a treatment

367
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,130
is borderline unethical,

368
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,400
but when there is a cure that the patient is ignoring --

369
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,050
You don't want her to die.

370
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,090
Thanks for the summation.

371
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,860
But have you considered it might be more than that?

372
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,510
This cure, it doesn't come without a cost.

373
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,730
To your mother.

374
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,180
But to you...

375
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,220
...if your mother loses her artistic ability,

376
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,540
your relationship changes.

377
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,000
If she loses the thing she lords over you,

378
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,140
she -- maybe she'd be nicer.

379
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,040
You hate the way she looks at you.

380
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,200
But that is who she is.

381
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,440
Let's try it Shaun's way.

382
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,240
Sorry about this all-nighter,

383
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,070
but sleeplessness

384
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,400
will increase the odds of a seizure event.

385
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,350
Which isn't pleasant, but we need.

386
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,660
All this equipment will tell us

387
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,120
if it was caused by the Cav Mals

388
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,990
or by a remote microbleed.

389
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,820
You want me to put on the TV?

390
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,840
I find something suitably irritating.

391
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,030
Don't bother. I'll be staying.

392
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,020
"Cavernous malformations may leak blood,

393
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,720
leading to brain hemorrhage, seizures,

394
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,780
loss of sensation, risk of paralysis" --

395
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,650
If you have to do this,

396
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,540
can't you find some - "Harry Potter" or something?

397
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,060
We can look forward.

398
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,120
Or we can look back.

399
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,260
Do you want to discuss what a lousy mother you were?

400
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,730
Baby, I know that stress and anger

401
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:05,830
can increase the chance of a seizure,

402
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,190
and you're so sweet to try --

403
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,650
Shall we go chronologically?

404
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,600
First day of preschool, when you promised to pick me up,

405
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,880
but you forgot because you were showing Ariel

406
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,660
how to underpaint with raw umber.

407
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,070
You wore a kilt? How'd it go?

408
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,190
We binge-watched  six episodes of "Outlander,"

409
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,170
she fell asleep on the sofa, so I came back to work.

410
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,350
Hi. I'm Oliver.

411
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,110
I have six months to live.

412
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,730
Hello, Dr. Murphy.

413
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,040
I'm Dr. Park.

414
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,990
I went out.

415
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,880
In a new Ferrari.

416
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,870
But when I got home,

417
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,980
I started to feel...dizzy,

418
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,520
sick to my stomach.

419
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,340
Fainted and hit my head.

420
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,950
I think I might have been poisoned by the fugu fish.

421
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,760
You ate a fish you knew might kill you.

422
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,600
You're emptying the bank accounts.

423
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,280
Only my retirement savings, which I'm not gonna need.

424
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,140
You don't have fugu poisoning.

425
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,530
I know because you're not already paralyzed or dead.

426
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,350
We'll keep you for observation and run some tests.

427
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,190
Uh, how long?

428
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,240
We have a room booked in Costa Rica.

429
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,280
Enough.

430
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,730
I can't quit my job and move to the jungle.

431
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,090
Actually, you can.

432
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,810
I won't stay here.

433
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,960
You're gonna leave me?

434
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,030
I've invited you to come with me.

435
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,690
I want us to see Costa Rica together.

436
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,640
You're choosing the howler monkeys over me?

437
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,270
That's where I rank, behind the monkeys?

438
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,280
Bella, I love you.

439
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,750
I've loved our 20 years together.

440
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,510
I want to see Costa Rica.

441
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,160
I want you to come with me.

442
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,720
But I'm going either way.

443
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,980
Go.

444
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,940
I don't want to spend whatever time is left with...

445
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,950
whoever you are now.

446
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,490
I'm happy.

447
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,330
I thought I made you happy.

448
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,450
Jumping ahead.

449
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,570
The day I won the regional science fair,

450
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,570
beating five other schools,

451
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,740
including those nerds from Alston Prep,

452
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,600
do you know what you said to me?

453
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,480
That you were so glad I had something to fall back on.

454
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,780
I'm aware of your feelings about me as a mother.

455
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,080
I'm aware that our values are different.

456
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,950
It doesn't mean I don't love you.

457
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,910
I always have.

458
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,090
It didn't matter that you weren't creative.

459
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,640
You seriously don't think there's creativity in what I do?

460
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,180
I think that's something technical people tell themselves.

461
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,980
But it's not a moral judgment.

462
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,310
It's the luck of the draw.

463
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm an artist. You're a...

464
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,780
hard worker.

465
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,260
August 12, 2014 -- Times art section.

466
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,180
I don't want to hear it.

467
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,120
"Caroline Reznick's showing at the Armory is a lesson 

468
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,380
in what happens when a once-interesting artist 

469
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,060
sits too long on her laurels."

470
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,770
That woman hated me for years.

471
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,690
She was waiting for an opportunity.

472
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,360
"Bad judgment doesn't begin to explain

473
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,860
what went wrong with every stroke of this ill-conceived" --

474
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,990
I mean, really, how many negative words can you pile together?

475
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,280
And she hasn't even gotten to that part

476
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,910
about that "Modern Madonna" piece

477
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,490
that you were so proud of.

478
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,080
What -- Remember what she -- what she called it?

479
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,690
- What was that? - Put that thing down!

480
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,300
I'm sorry. It's not gliosis.

481
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,680
I went through that for nothing?

482
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,200
Mom, we eliminated a possibility.

483
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,330
That's not nothing.

484
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,200
It's a day I spent in this hospital

485
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,230
when I could've been home working.

486
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,240
How soon can I be discharged?

487
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,780
You need to rest for a day.

488
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,870
And then we can say goodbye.

489
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,320
If I only had six months to live,

490
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,890
I would not stop being a surgeon.

491
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,350
I would.

492
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,120
I'd move from spa to spa,

493
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,920
having massages and drinks with little umbrellas.

494
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,990
Then I'd throw a party in the penthouse of the Four Seasons.

495
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,260
And after everybody left, I'd go into the marble bathroom

496
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,160
and painlessly self-euthanize.

497
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,910
I'd obviously leave a big tip for housekeeping.

498
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,790
You're very like your mother.

499
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,670
That's not something I hear a lot.

500
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,130
Well, he's right.

501
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,940
You would reign like a queen over your own death,

502
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,430
insisting on absolute control.

503
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,200
I just meant you each have a funny way

504
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,060
of picking things up with both hands sometimes.

505
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,520
I don't think this is anatomically correct.

506
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,000
Stereotactic laser ablation.

507
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,190
You worked with one of the people

508
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,100
who developed the technique.

509
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,650
We never used to call it that.

510
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,260
I never liked that name.

511
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,070
Also, it's never been used

512
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,110
in Cerebral Cavernous Malformations.

513
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,470
Not yet.

514
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,810
It would allow us to target the malformations

515
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,240
without needing to slice all those cerebral fibers

516
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,120
or remove a chunk of my mother's brain.

517
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,870
It would have to be applied to each malformation

518
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,330
with exact precision.

519
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,670
Okay, so do that.

520
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:06,650
You can't.

521
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,130
You're gonna make a mistake on one or two of them.

522
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,510
And then you got more bleeding, seizures,

523
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,010
you got inflamed malformations growing out of control.

524
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,660
You can.

525
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,270
Even if I was still a neurosurgeon,

526
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,020
which I'm not, I wouldn't.

527
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,750
You don't get to quit who you are.

528
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,220
How long has it been since you had your hands inside

529
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,850
the source of what makes us human?

530
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,990
That flow, in surgery, knowing every move

531
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,060
and just feeling how right it is --

532
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,230
that's peak existence.

533
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,240
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna do the surgery.

534
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,830
Are you s--

535
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,080
Are you scared to pick up a scalpel?

536
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:06,810
You had months of chemo and radiation.

537
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,460
Maybe it took its toll.

538
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,230
E-even a 10% drop in performance would be unbearable.

539
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,090
Why risk finding it out?

540
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,510
Get out.

541
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,410
Skydiving?

542
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Fugu?

543
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,490
And apparently a yellow suit.

544
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:39,680
Do you think a deadline like he has

545
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,960
burns you down to who you really are?

546
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,000
Or does it just make you nuts and desperate?

547
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,000
Why can't it be both?

548
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,260
Okay, um...

549
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,390
a little house in the middle of nowhere.

550
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,720
Two chickens. One dog.

551
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
Nobody who expects anything from me.

552
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,270
Nobody who is even verbal.

553
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,080
I'm tired of trying to fix myself.

554
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,230
And I'm tired of being known as a soft touch.

555
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,860
Not buying it.

556
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,590
There's no way you would get a dog

557
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,170
if you only had six months to live.

558
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,240
Wouldn't be fair.

559
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,700
Okay, then I would foster a series of rescue dogs.

560
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,350
You said you're tired of being a soft touch,

561
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,500
and yet your fantasy involves helping.

562
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,840
We are who we are.

563
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:01,620
It's called stereotactic laser ablation.

564
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,580
Never liked the name.

565
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:17,230
He said it's minimally invasive, and if it works,

566
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,680
it would save my life

567
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,220
and allow me to continue painting.

568
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,140
If I win, I win everything.

569
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,940
And if I lose, it's over.

570
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,200
When you first came to see Dr. Glassman,

571
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,070
he didn't offer this option. Why not?

572
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,440
Stereotactic laser ablation is a new technique,

573
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,840
and it's never been used on a Cav Mal patient.

574
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,420
So, he just didn't think of it?

575
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,620
But then it came to him?

576
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,750
It was my idea.

577
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,250
Dr. Glassman didn't sugarcoat the risks.

578
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,050
This is the last chance you've got to keep your art.

579
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,140
I'm not going to complete my work if I'm dead.

580
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,390
No.

581
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,430
But thank you so much for trying.

582
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,530
Why didn't you back me up?

583
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,620
I didn't know you were gonna throw this crapshoot at us.

584
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,160
Do you even listen to what she's been saying?

585
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,800
She wants to finish her work.

586
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,640
She could live another 40 years,

587
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,600
and her art would grow with her.

588
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,350
Don't pretend those words mean anything to you.

589
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,000
You don't give a damn about art.

590
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,150
Her family could grow with her --

591
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,260
her children, her grandchildren.

592
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,050
You and her don't give a damn about anything except for art.

593
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,100
You need to listen to me and do what I tell you.

594
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,480
This is why we didn't call you.

595
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,950
The competition in that family must have been like a buzz saw.

596
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,330
- Okay. - Please.

597
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,590
It's perfectly reasonable to get out of a game you can't win.

598
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,480
You did everything right --

599
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,240
moved 3,000 miles, found your own calling,

600
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,740
a career people respect and value.

601
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,530
Actually, there's a good comparative measure

602
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,990
for how people value things.

603
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,100
We call it money.

604
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,120
And my brother's already a million dollars ahead.

605
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,900
See how you went straight to your brother?

606
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,790
Did you ever think

607
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,900
he might be tired of being your competitor?

608
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,670
He won a long time ago.

609
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,880
That's why I left that dysfunctional world behind.

610
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,780
Really?

611
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,340
Because it seems to me

612
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,130
you re-created the competition you grew up with

613
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,830
the very first day you got here.

614
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,670
Shingles? Like, from chicken pox?

615
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,270
The virus was dormant,

616
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,340
then your chemo suppressed your immune system,

617
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,760
and the virus woke up.

618
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,320
It can be painful,

619
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,430
but the treatment is very simple.

620
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,010
Do you want us to call your wife?

621
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,270
No, thank you.

622
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,310
Just fix me up and release me into the wild.

623
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,770
Back to the bucket list.

624
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,690
She was right.

625
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,780
I'm not the same person.

626
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,630
I'm doing what we all should be doing.

627
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,630
We all want to cut loose,

628
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,220
but we're just too practical.

629
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,660
If this had not happened,

630
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,460
I might've lived to be 90, never looking up.

631
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,310
Dr. Murphy, what do you want to do

632
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,310
that you just haven't done yet?

633
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,400
What makes you happy?

634
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,590
- I want to give Carly -- - Shaun.

635
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,850
I like a crisp apple.

636
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,620
The way the sunlight hits my bedsheets

637
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,110
in the morning in a perfect square.

638
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,070
I like the movement of wind in leaves.

639
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,710
And the way the circumference of a circle

640
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,620
is always equal to pi times the diameter,

641
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,700
no matter what numbers you put in.

642
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,620
You like the happiness of small things.

643
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,380
Yes.

644
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,670
Your happiness is too loud.

645
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,300
Shake your head again.

646
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,570
Didn't he have a muscle issue?

647
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,390
His range of motion seems good.

648
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,650
All the better for zip-lining in Costa Rica, right?

649
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,610
Not right.

650
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,110
We need more tests.

651
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,750
I'm sorry.

652
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,460
I know we want the same things.

653
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,630
I'd like to show you something.

654
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,140
Neurons that fire together wire together.

655
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,390
One neuron goes off, exciting the next,

656
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,160
creating a pathway in the brain

657
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,110
that wasn't there before.

658
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,080
Every time Mom takes a brushstroke,

659
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,690
every time you use a chisel.

660
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,420
It's like we're creating ourselves

661
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,160
in the choices we make.

662
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,990
We are creating this.

663
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,160
It's beautiful.

664
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,140
We target each malformation

665
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,690
with a thermal laser probe.

666
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,800
Just the malformation.

667
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,550
The trajectory has to be perfect.

668
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,050
You can't paint over it.

669
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,930
You could show this to Mom.

670
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,640
But from you, she'll accept it.

671
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,410
Inserting the laser probe into the cooling catheter.

672
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,370
Locked and loaded. Ready to fire.

673
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,900
Dr. Glassman, are you sure of this location?

674
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,440
It seems significantly far

675
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,800
from what we saw on her pre-surgical MRIs.

676
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,260
You know what the brain and breakfast cereal have in common?

677
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,770
Contents tend to shift during transport.

678
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:42,980
Yes, I'm quite sure.

679
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,030
First ablation complete.

680
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,920
Now we just have to do it perfectly nine more times.

681
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,660
It's gone?

682
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,490
Well, not quite. But close.

683
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,370
The recent infections got into the tumor.

684
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:27,190
Which allowed your immune system to find it.

685
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,290
But they said it was an aggressive cancer.

686
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,880
What makes a cancer aggressive

687
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,070
is its ability to evade the immune system.

688
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,410
That's no longer true about yours.

689
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:50,390
The tumor has become small enough

690
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,340
to remove surgically.

691
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,360
We can make an appointment to do that in a few days,

692
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,730
once the infection has fully cleared your system.

693
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,680
Meanwhile, you can go home.

694
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,520
Congratulations.

695
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,150
Home?

696
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,320
How do you feel?

697
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,050
Tired

698
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,070
of being in this place.

699
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,700
Reasonable answer.

700
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,990
Do you feel your creativity's impaired?

701
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,550
Isn't that the graphic you use to sign your paintings?

702
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,630
Thank you for knowing that.

703
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,630
Ariel was afraid you'd feel vandalized.

704
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,860
Ah, don't be silly.

705
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,180
We'll auction off the door.

706
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,490
Mom, you've thanked your doctors,

707
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,360
but you haven't said anything to Morgan.

708
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,940
You know, getting out of this mess intact,

709
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,320
that's down to her.

710
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,780
Oh, yes, I know.

711
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,410
I owe you everything.

712
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,130
Thank you... for saving my life.

713
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,220
You're welcome.

714
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,230
Our little plodder came through.

715
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,570
Not everybody gets a parade.

716
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,410
Maybe Carly doesn't have them.

717
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,930
Maybe I haven't practiced enough.

718
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:49,850
I've worked on my surgical technique

719
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,310
for hundreds of hours.

720
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,460
You can't just take the pizza out of the freezer and dig in.

721
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,170
You have to put it in the microwave first.

722
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,940
Actually, Dr. Lim,

723
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,180
a toaster oven is better for the crust.

724
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,850
She's not talking about pizza, Shaun.

725
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,290
Men your age run out of patience.

726
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:17,440
They turn off the microwave before that pizza's ready.

727
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,160
You want to give a parade, Shaun?

728
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:25,970
Yes.

729
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,720
You want to give a great parade?

730
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,120
Are there differences in parades?

731
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,180
Some have balloons and marching bands.

732
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,500
Other parades are sparsely attended.

733
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:42,380
I want Carly to have the best parade possible.

734
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,050
I know you do.

735
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,140
Just as you want to be the best surgeon possible.

736
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,100
When you're in the O.R., you commit totally.

737
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,660
You persevere. Everything else falls away.

738
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,610
You focus entirely on what you're doing.

739
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,730
That's your superpower.

740
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,160
Now I want you to take Carly home

741
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,880
and work that parade route

742
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,580
and don't stop until the band begins playing.

743
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,960
And then go 3% longer.

744
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,260

749
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,500
I wouldn't want to be anywhere but where I am.
