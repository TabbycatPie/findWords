I think there's a leak.

安德伍德政府的
In the Underwood Administration.

26
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,350
我們怎能相信他說的話呢
How can we trust anything he says?

加勒特·沃克任總統期間一直在用藥

We all know that.

29

-黨內警告  -不行
- Censure. - No.

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,850

There is no way to stop the Republicans in the House.

32
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,960
-你認識我多久了  -很久了
- How long have you known me? - Forever.

33

那你有多了解我
How well do you know me?

也不該以為我會接受這個

37
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,430
是我導致了你丈夫的死

否則我們也不會在一起這么久了

There's no need to insult me, Francis.

會有一堆證人反駁
Witness after witness is gonna rebut

你要說的一切
whatever you have to say.

62
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,120
我的證詞就是那樣
My testimony is what it is.

63
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,060
公眾輿論會自有公斷
It'll all be resolved in the court of public opinion.

64
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,300
是啊  但公眾會信誰呢
Yes, but who is the public going to believe?

65
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,070
你  還是恐怖分子電腦上的爆炸物殘留
You or explosive residue on a terrorist's computer?

66
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,860
凱茜  你的證詞會看上去像小氣的報復
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem petty and vengeful.

67
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,370
那你會怎么樣啊  還有什么前途
And then where is that gonna leave you? What prospects?

-你得栽一跟頭  -什么
- You need to take a fall. - Excuse me?

70
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,680
委員會得等等
Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.

71
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,860
反正再過兩周這都會過去
In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway,

72
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,930
你就站錯隊了
and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.

73
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,050
-走著瞧吧  -是啊
- Well, we'll see. - Yes, we will.

74
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,450
你先請
After you.

凱茜
Cathy?

凱茜
Cathy?

You're a lucky bastard.

80
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,410

Oh, not until the end of the night.

81
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,980
或者該說早上了
Or should I say, the morning.

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,730
凱瑟琳·杜蘭特摔倒了  怎么回事
Catherine Durant fell? How?

83
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,980
人會摔倒  就這么簡單
Well, people fall. That's what they do.

84
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,420
是啊  在需要的時候
Yes, they fall when they need to.

85
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,930
你的新朋友還是會被彈劾的
Your new friend is still gonna get impeached.

86
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,680
希望到時候
Well, I hope I can still count on

87
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,170
參議員還是會支持我
the good senator's support when the time comes.

88
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,860
你很會打牌  馬克
You're a good card player, Mark.

89
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,260
你從不在牌桌上談公事
You never talk shop at the table.

90
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,570
總是提款的時候才說
It's always when you're cashing out.

91
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,340
我媽媽教得好
Well, my mother raised me well.

92
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,410
票數讓參議員越來越難做了
The numbers are getting harder and harder for the senator.

93
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,320
-為什么  -資金流入  電話打來
- Why is that? - The money and the calls coming in.

94
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,220
一個數字減少  另一個就增多
One number goes down, and the other one goes up.

95
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,440
參議員受到了壓力  來自哪里
The senator's feeling the heat, from where?

96
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,420
你回頭再來吧  我們到時談
Why don't you come in later. We can talk about it then.

97
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,590
不不  等一下
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

98
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,450
丹尼  我指著他的票呢
Danny... I'm counting on his vote.

99
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,830
-那別指望了  -不行
- Well, you can count it out. - No. No...

100
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,040
半數民主黨都是如此
And half of the Democrats as well.

101
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,040
別去想什么警告了  眾議院還未就
Forget about censure, the House hasn't even voted yet

102
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,110
彈劾狀表決呢
on articles of impeachment.

103
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,200
你不是唯一在做參議院工作的人
You're not the only one working the Senate.

104
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,850
-有人想趕走弗蘭西斯  -我問是誰
- Someone wants Francis out. - And I'm asking you who.

105
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,790
你混了很久了
You've been around a long time.

106
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,160
沒人會告訴你怎么投票
Nobody tells you how to vote.

107
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,840
只會說你不聽他們的會有什么下場
They just tell you what happens if you don't go their way.

108
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,260
石油每桶50美元
Oil's at $50 a barrel.

109
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,970
沒人對此滿意
Nobody's happy with that.

110
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,480
我們本打算今天對司法委員會
We were hoping to bring you live coverage

111
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,230
聽證會進行直播
of the judiciary hearing today.

112
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,290
但由于杜蘭特國務卿
But given the postponement

113
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,980
意外地無法出席  而使聽證會延期
due to Secretary Durant's unexpected absence,

114
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,860
我們將改為
we'll be switching to

115
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,100
轉播軍事委員會的會議
the Armed Services Committee meeting instead,

116
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,970
-女士  -多位軍隊高官
- Ma'am? - where several top military officials...

117
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,930
將報告哈里發國愈增的威脅
...are citing the increased threat of ICO...

118
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,210
今天的日程
Today's schedule.

119
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,690
我覺得您會想看這個
And I thought you might wanna see this.

120
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,390
是湯姆·耶茨的信
It's a note from Tom Yates.

121
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,040
另外
Oh, and reminder,

122
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,650
我們得繼續士兵康復項目
we have to get back to the Soldier Recovery Project.

123
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,800
和平
Peace.

124
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,280
那是我們的目標
That's our goal.

125
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,860
通過和平  我們得找到新的前進之途
And through peace, we must find a different way forward.

126
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,340
伊斯瑪特上校是民主派領袖
Colonel Ismat is the leader of the Democratic faction,

127
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,510
竭力解放敘利亞人民
dedicated to freeing the Syrian people.

128
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,730
由于杜蘭特國務卿暫時無法繼續工作
And since Secretary Durant is temporarily sidelined,

129
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,970
我今天要暫代她  因為美國政府
I'm stepping in today because the American government

130
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,610
支持一切邁向穩定的堅實腳步
supports any concrete steps toward stability.

131
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,810
如果得到確認  敘利亞沖突中
If it is determined that chemical or biological weapons

132
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,210
用到了生化武器
have been used in the Syrian conflict,

133
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,620
那么從此刻起
then from this moment forward,

134
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,100
美國將有道德義務插手
the United States will be morally obligated to intervene.

135
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,970
所以  敘利亞總統算就此得到警告了
So, the Syrian president should consider himself on notice.

136
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,410
總統先生  鑒于眾議院
Mr. President, given the potential outcome

137
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,980
可能提交彈劾狀
that the House will affirm articles of impeachment,

138
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,890
現在插手中東沖突合適嗎
is this the right time to wade into a Middle Eastern conflict?

139
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,860
這個問題與主題無關  但我還是回答吧
Well, the question's off subject, but I'll answer it.

140
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,250
首先  投票就不會進入參議院
First of all, the vote is never gonna get to the Senate.

141
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,570
這只是毫無意義的黨爭鬧劇
It's a senseless partisan circus.

142
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,000
我的關注點是做好我的工作
My focus is to remain doing my job,

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,410
也就是確保美國人民繁榮富強
which is to ensure prosperity for the American people,

144
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,300
并努力實現
and to try to achieve...

145
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,930
對不起  和平怎么說的來著
I'm sorry, how did you say it again? Peace?

146
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,910
-和平  -和平
- Salam. - Salam...

147
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,520
這就是我們在努力爭取的  和平
That's what we're trying to broker here. Salam.

148
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,060
我們給總統和伊斯瑪特上校時間會面吧
So let's give the president time to meet with Colonel Ismat.

149
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,000
我會在媒體接待室接受提問
I'll take follow-up questions in the press briefing room.

150
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,570
或許我太沒想象力  但那就是夜晚的大海啊
Maybe I'm being too literal, but that's the sea at night.

151
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,940
-你喜歡嗎  -我更喜歡紅的
- Do you like it? - I prefer the reds.

152
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,040
我在泰特現代藝術館看過他的展出
I... I saw a show of his at the Tate Modern.

153
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,510
但我無法把人和藝術品分開
I have trouble separating the man from the art, though.

154
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,110
他是個壓抑的人  你肯定也知道
He was, uh, depressive, as I'm sure you know.

155
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,920
你能看出他在抵抗心魔
You can see him fighting his demons.

156
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,800
納澤先生到了
So Mr. Nasser has arrived?

157
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,180
到了  在四季酒店等我的電話
Uh, here and waiting for my call at the Four Seasons.

158
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,180
我就是覺得這恐怕不好
Well, I just... I don't think it's a good idea

159
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,720
我們政府的一位成員
for anyone in our administration

160
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
去見哈里發國的成員
to be meeting with a member of ICO.

161
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,820
他不是成員
He's not a member.

162
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,300
他跟尤瑟夫·艾哈邁迪是同學
He went to school with Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

163
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,010
他是律師  他代理人和組織
He's a lawyer. He represents people, organizations.

164
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,270
-就一個組織  -而且他是要見我
- One organization, to be exact. - And he's meeting with me.

165
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,720
為什么有這樣的猶豫
Where is all this hesitation coming from?

166
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,720
對不起  我頭好疼
I'm sorry. I just have a splitting headache.

167
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,030
胡蔓藤
Gelsemium.

168
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,970
治偏頭痛的  我經常犯
For migraines. I get them all the time.

169
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,510
是中藥
It comes out of China.

170
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,710
別擔心  是草藥
But don't worry, it's herbal.

171
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,400
但你得注意用量
You have to be careful of the dosing, though.

172
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,930
就兩滴
Just two drops.

173
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,960
我看到的是純粹的感覺
You know, it's pure feeling for me.

174
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,670
光明對黑暗
Light versus dark.

175
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,050
和他們的交界線
And that line where they meet.

176
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,580
總統根本不知道
The president had no idea.

177
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,020
你跟麥卡倫先生很親密
You were close to Mr. Macallan?

178
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,880
是的  但那不代表我知道他的企圖
Yes, but that doesn't mean that I knew what he was up to.

179
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,620
那你怎么知道總統與此無關
But then how do you know the president wasn't involved?

180
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,740
我是最后見到艾丹的人  他向我坦白了
I was the last person to see Aidan. He confessed to me.

181
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,650
他秘密利用了國安局和外國情報監視法法庭
He secretly used the NSA, FISA,

182
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,530
操縱了選民
to manipulate the electorate.

183
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,980
我們要會見律師
We're meeting with counsel

184
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,640
打磨剩下的證詞
to perfect the rest of the testimony.

185
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,570
只要沒人能拿出駁斥你的證據就行
As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.

186
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,910
不會有的
No one does.

187
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,990
回來的感覺好嗎  莉安
Does it feel good to be back, LeAnn?

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,230
是的  謝謝
It does. Thank you.

189
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,340
我知道克萊爾很高興
Well, I know Claire is delighted

190
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,670
你能回到她辦公室
to have you back in her office.

191
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,580
副總統的會面
Will you let me know as soon

192
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,300
一結束你就告訴我
as  the vice president's meeting is done?

193
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,230
好  先生
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,960
我討厭她回來  她撒謊
I hate having her back. She's a liar.

195
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,380
你覺得麥卡倫給了她什么做保險嗎
You think Macallan gave her something for insurance?

196
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,500
她不肯承認  但是的  我覺得有
She won't admit it. But, yeah, I think he did.

197
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,770
等委員會啟動后  讓她去作證吧
Let's get her in front of that committee when they're up and running.

198
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,450
到時她就必須決斷了
Then she'll have to make a choice.

199
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,460
格林有些不敢作證
Green is hesitant to testify.

200
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,080
要不是我知道
You know, if I didn't know better,

201
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,600
我會以為他是泄密者呢
I'd think he was the leak.

202
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,690
他知道的信息
He has far more information

203
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,120
實在太多了
than anyone should be comfortable with.

204
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,490
另外理查德森參議員還沒回我電話
Also, Senator Richardson hasn't called me back.

205
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,290
上校  抱歉剛剛不得不走開
Colonel, my apologies for the interruption.

206
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,610
我想向你保證  你的擔憂就是我的擔憂
And I want to assure you that your concerns are my concerns.

207
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,300
艾哈邁迪兄弟
The Ahmadi brothers...

208
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,780
他們所想的激進伊斯蘭是維持不下去的
their idea of radical Islam is unsustainable.

209
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,070
納澤代表了厭倦了死亡的哈里發國分子
Nasser represents members of ICO who are tired of death.

210
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,530
他們基本上控制了
They essentially control

211
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,010
多個油田和多家精煉廠
numerous oil fields and several refineries.

212
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,840
納澤已經見過了敘利亞總統
Nasser already met with the president of Syria.

213
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,370
還有佩特羅夫的外交部長
And Petrov's minister of foreign affairs.

214
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,070
他想做個交易
He's looking for a deal.

215
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,580
他們想在這個十年內成為
They wanna be a corporation trading on the Dow

216
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,390
上市公司
before the decade is over.

217
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,540
他們想加入石油輸出國組織
They wanna be a part of OPEC.

218
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,610
那么伊斯瑪特上校和敘利亞人民呢
So where does that leave Colonel Ismat and the Syrian people?

219
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,620
能保命  只要我們調兵
Alive... once we're on the ground.

220
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,900
是啊  但俄羅斯已被請去  我們需要理由
Yes, but Russia was invited in. We need cause.

221
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,530
敘利亞總統用毒氣對付了人民
The Syrian president has gassed civilians.

222
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,260
他還會再那么做的  我敢保證
He will again. I can guarantee it.

223
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,290
伊斯瑪特上校會確保這一點
Colonel Ismat will make sure of it.

224
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,110
他會在政權內部煽動襲擊
He'll instigate an attack from the regime.

225
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,900
我們派部隊過去  不動哈里發國的資源
We put troops on the ground, leave ICO resources alone...

226
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,450
納澤會確保他們配合
and Nasser will make sure they cooperate.

227
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,660
怎么了
What is it?

228
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,800
你擔心他會被彈劾嗎
Are you afraid he's gonna be impeached?

229
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,700
因為  他很可能會的
'Cause there's a good chance that he will be.

230
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,540
這就是你想等的原因嗎  因為
Is that why you wanna wait? 'Cause...

231
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,900
我可以推遲一切
I can make it all wait.

232
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,030
戴維斯女士和我的談話很有成效
Ms. Davis and I had a very productive talk.

233
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,300
我告訴了她
I let her know that

234
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,300
我們的插手是以艾哈邁迪的被捕為交換條件的
our involvement is contingent on the delivery of Ahmadi.

235
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,800
是啊  但我能采取行動的時間
Yes, but the window is closing for me

236
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,440
越來越少了
to be able to act on this.

237
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,590
司法委員會可不會等
Judiciary's not gonna wait.

238
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,630
想要這個起作用  時不我待
For this to be effective, it has to be now or never.

239
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,900
我會讓她聯絡納澤先生
I'll have her reach out to Mr. Nasser.

240
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,890
那另一件事呢
And, uh, what about the other matter?

241
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,130
莉安嗎
You mean LeAnn?

242
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,190
戴維斯女士今天下午會跟她談
Ms. Davis will speak to her later this afternoon.

243
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,260
你聽到總統的話了
You heard the president.

244
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,750
我還在白宮
Uh, I'm still at the White House.

245
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,770
-等我們插手敘利亞  -先生
- Once we get into Syria... - Sir,

246
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,850
我是肖恩·杰弗瑞斯

247
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,710
-我跟...  -嗯  我知道你是誰
- I work with... - Yes, I know who you are.

248
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,540
肖恩
Sean...

249
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,630
我知道湯姆·漢默施密特在查什么
I know what Tom Hammerschmidt is working on.

250
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,750
杰弗瑞斯先生  如果你想預約  我可以安排
Mr. Jeffries, if you need an appointment, I can arrange one...

251
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,200
先生  我只想占用您片刻時間
Sir, if I could. Just a moment of your time.

252
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,810
是機密
It's confidential.

253
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,300
如果你不介意  我們想用一下這個房間
Oh, if you don't mind, we'd like this room for a moment.

254
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,580
給你30秒  但你開始前
You have 30 seconds. But before you start,

255
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,150
是我錯了嗎  格雷森先生不是你的上級嗎
am I mistaken, or is Mr. Grayson your superior?

256
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,090
是的  對不起  但是
Yes, I'm sorry, but...

257
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,520
湯姆認為  道格·斯坦普和您  先生
Tom thinks Doug Stamper and yourself, sir,

258
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,920
跟佐伊·巴恩斯之死有關
are somehow involved with the death of Zoe Barnes.

259
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,100
漢默施密特先生得到了一部
And Mr. Hammerschmidt has a phone

260
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,330
有人給巴恩斯小姐的手機
that was given to Ms. Barnes.

261
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:32,140
手機只打過一個號碼  是您的號碼
It called only one number, and that number was yours.

262
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,130
看來這個號碼
Now, it seems that number

263
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,350
在她死時帶的手機里也有
has shown up on the phone that she died with.

264
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,180
雖然手機受損  但現在有技術
It was damaged, but there's technology now

265
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,520
可以讓他們獲取她死前
that will give them access to the data

266
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,070
手機上的數據
leading up to the day of her death.

267
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,220
內存  電話  短信

268
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,990
都在上面
It's all there.

269
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
你什么時候開始為我們工作的
When did you start with us?

270
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,690
一周前
A week ago.

271
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,300
是副總統讓你加入的
And it was the vice president who brought you on?

272
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,390
是的
That's correct.

273
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,030
一周
A week...

274
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,520
你已經
and you're already having

275
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,910
跟總統談機密了
confidential conversations with the president.

276
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:09,970
是的
I am.

277
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,680
如果你再聽到別的消息  直接來找我
If you hear anything else, you come directly to me.

278
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,050
是  先生
Yes, sir.

279
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,560
不管你怎么說  這是偽證罪
Whatever you say it is, it's perjury.

280
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,050
偽證
Oh, perjury, huh?

281
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,590
這是你的底線嗎
That's where you draw the line?

282
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,210
我不干了
I'm done.

283
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,910
案子已經準備好了
The case has already been prepared.

284
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,340
穆罕默德·卡拉比的電腦上找到了熵炸藥
TATP was found on Muhammed Kalabi's computer.

285
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,370
杜蘭特國務卿怎么想根本不重要
It doesn't matter what Secretary Durant believes or not.

286
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,130
一個是推測  一個是事實
One is speculation, and the other is fact.

287
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,180
事實  是嗎  那是事實嗎
Fact? Really? Is that what it is?

288
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:49,190
如果聽上去像事實  那就是事實
If it sounds like a fact, then it is a fact.

289
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,920
卡拉比鍵盤上有爆炸殘留物
Kalabi had explosive residue on his keyboard.

290
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,920
你知道聯調局其他人都受夠總統了
You know the rest of the bureau is done with the president.

291
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,230
我沒跟他們說話  我在跟你說話
I'm not talking to them. I'm talking to you.

292
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,920
他們都睜一只眼閉一只眼  但還能持續多久
They've looked the other way, but for how much longer?

293
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,040
道格  他完了
Doug... he's done.

294
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,130
那我怎么辦
Where does that leave me?

295
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,340
這就是我們在談的
That's what we're discussing right now.

296
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,480
你知道總統怎么想嗎
Do you know what the president thinks?

297
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,560
他覺得你是泄密者
He thinks you're the leak.

298
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,530
那倒好了
I wish.

299
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,440
我給你點時間收回那句話
I'm going to give you a moment to take that statement back.

300
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,620
我會做我該做的  我去作證
I'll do what I have to do. I'll testify.

301
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,000
但總統完了
But the president is done.

302
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,770
他在失去支持  你能感覺到
He's losing support. You can smell it.

303
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,450
你在給別人效力嗎
Are you working for anyone else?

304
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,590
-你在給別人效力嗎  -沒有
- Are you working for anyone else? - No.

305
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,320
我也不想知道別的
And I don't wanna know anything else.

306
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,600
我已知的已經讓我煩透了
I'm tired of what I know.

307
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,260
就當我是個傳話的
Consider me a proxy.

308
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,990
-什么  -他們不想問  但我來問
- What? - They don't wanna ask, but I will.

309
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,740
你必須完全投入
You need to be fully committed,

310
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,400
也就是說  你得完全透明
which means being fully transparent,

311
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,230
也就是說  你得交出你手上的東西
which means handing over what you have.

312
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,060
能拜托你等等嗎
Slow down, will you, please?

313
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,190
我想回家了  戴維斯女士
I'd like to get home, Ms. Davis.

314
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,350
莉安  莉安
LeAnn? LeAnn?

315
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,870
有時候  我會去賓館過夜
Some nights, I go to a hotel to sleep,

316
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,860
就為了換換地方  不在家待著
just to get out of my apartment.

317
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,600
這個城市的女人  都要高度警惕
Being a woman in this city, the vigilance it takes...

318
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,780
你不能犯任何錯誤  不能有一絲分神
You're not allowed to make a mistake... get distracted.

319
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,480
代價很沉重
It's a heavy price.

320
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,420
神經緊繃年復一年
To be on the edge that way for years and years...

321
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,810
我的證詞不會讓人失望的
My testimony won't disappoint.

322
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,240
就算總統和副總統滿意吧
Well, the president and vice president are pleased, I assume.

323
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,870
但你覺得還要多久
But how long before the media

324
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,420
媒體就會開始追問麥卡倫的死
starts asking questions about Macallan's death,

325
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,470
以及他怎么死的
and how he was killed?

326
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,980
順便說一句  你的槍在我這里
I have your gun, by the way.

327
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,010
-晚安  -沒錯  晚安
- Good night. - Yes, good night.

328
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,750
克萊爾
Claire?

329
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,660
-怎么了  -克萊爾
- Yes? - Claire?

330
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,060
什么事
What's the matter?

331
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
漢默施密特又有了個新理論
Hammerschmidt has a new theory.

332
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,440
他認為道格·斯坦普和我殺了佐伊·巴恩斯
He thinks Doug Stamper and I killed Zoe Barnes.

333
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,120
他們可能接觸到了我的手機短信內容
They may have access to my cell phone, to my texts.

334
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,990
白宮有人在向漢默施密特泄密
Someone in this White House is talking to Hammerschmidt

335
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,420
現在又是這個
and now this.

336
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,680
道格啊
Oh, Doug.

337
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,810
可憐的道格
Poor Doug.

338
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,630
是啊
Yes.

339
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,180
他怎么這么倒霉
He's an unlucky person.

340
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,060
他一直如此
Always has been.

341
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,940
先生  參議員的支持動搖了
Sir, the senator's support is wavering.

342
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,510
道格  我是克萊爾
Doug, it's Claire.

343
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,800
抱歉  我...
I'm sorry, I...

344
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,740
弗蘭西斯和我在想
Francis and I were wondering

345
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,370
你明晚能不能到宅邸來一趟
if you could come up to the residence tomorrow evening.

346
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,790
吃個晚飯
For dinner.

347
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,760
最近發生了這么多事
It'll give us a chance to

348
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,240
我們也好歇一歇  喘口氣
take a breath with all that's been happening.

349
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,540
喂
Hello?

350
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,470
生日快樂
Happy birthday.

351
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,440
-你是誰  -拜托  你肯定猜到了吧
- Who is this? - Come on, you must know by now.

352
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,650
-我不知道  -艾丹·麥卡倫
- No, I don't. - Aidan Macallan.

353
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,640
查查他是怎么利用外國情報監視法裁決的
Look into how he used and abused the FISA ruling.

354
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,690
我們怎么認識的
How do we know each other?

355
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,400
別問了
Now come on.

356
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,060
如果我告訴你
If I told you that,

357
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,900
我還要怎么繼續幫你
how can I possibly keep helping you?

358
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,540
你難道不希望我幫你嗎
And don't you want me to help you?

359
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,200
可我們在哪見面  告訴我這個就行
But where do we meet? Just give me that.

360
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,310
-泥巴里  -等等
- In the muck. - Wait.

361
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,560
佐伊·巴恩斯的死不是意外
Zoe Barnes' death was not an accident.

362
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,300
道格·斯坦普殺了她
Doug Stamper killed her.

363
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,650
但你已經知道了
But you already know that.

364
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,060
不  別掛  別掛
No, don't hang up. Don't hang up.

365
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,150
司法委員會可能
The Judiciary Committee may be

366
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,620
還希望杜蘭特國務卿盡快恢復
hoping Secretary Durant recovers.

367
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,870
但全世界都在關注
But the rest of the world is waiting to see

368
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,260
敘利亞總統將如何回應
how the Syrian president responds

369
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,320
安德伍德總統劃下的紅線
to President Underwood's line in the sand.

370
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,110
與此同時  莫斯科稱總統此份聲明
Moscow, meanwhile, calls the president's statements,

371
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,450
是"即將倒臺之人的絕望之舉"
"The desperate act of a man on his way out of office."

372
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,950
你和你哥哥還有聯系嗎
Are you in contact with your brother?

373
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,260
沒有
No.

374
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,880
也就周末吧  偶爾過過生日
Sundays. Occasional birthday.

375
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,330
我還以為你們兩個要更親近些
I thought you were closer than that.

376
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,290
沒有  只有有麻煩時我們才會找對方
No. We usually only speak when one of us is in trouble.

377
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,610
所以我才打聽一下
Well, that's why I ask,

378
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,200
因為越是這種時候  我們就越需要支持
'cause in times like these, we all need support.

379
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
我會請律師
Well, I'll have counsel.

380
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,370
不  你得請最好的律師
No, you'll have the best lawyers.

381
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,780
什么都得最好的  頂尖的
The best of everything. The best.

382
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,100
你還想再來些魚嗎
Would you like some more fish?

383
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,060
不了  謝謝
No, thank you.

384
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,220
《先驅報》手里的料都只是間接的
Whatever the Herald has is circumstantial.

385
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,400
當然
Of course.

386
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,520
沒人知道她到底遭遇了什么
No one knows what really happened to her,

387
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,840
永遠也不會有人知道
and no one ever will.

388
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,880
是這樣  道格
But, look, Doug...

389
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,470
今晚我和克萊爾請你來的原因
The reason that Claire and I invited you over tonight

390
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,490
是因為我們希望你知道你對我們多么重要
is because we want you to know how much you mean to us.

391
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,900
對我們兩個都是
To both of us.

392
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,510
好  先生
Yes, sir.

393
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,920
在我們說別的事之前
Before we say anything else,

394
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,910
我們只想明白無誤地確認
we just wanted to be absolutely certain that...

395
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,010
你知道這一點
you knew that.

396
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,390
當然
Of course.

397
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,980
我們要面臨的
What we're up against,

398
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,970
這個政府要面臨的
what this administration is facing...

399
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,930
也是我要面臨的
Well, what I'm facing...

400
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,860
即便我們都相信
Even though both of us believe that

401
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,740
我被起訴的可能微乎其微
there's very little chance that I could ever be indicted,

402
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,210
我們仍然
we still...

403
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,960
得想辦法
have to find a way to

404
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,980
徹底解決這整件事
remove this entire issue from the table.

405
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,470
我不能再跟這事有牽連了
I just can no longer be associated with this.

406
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,890
我會辭職  并繼續處理此事
I'll resign while I'm dealing with this.

407
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,490
我覺得這可能還不夠
I think this is going to require more than that.

408
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,420
我會發表聲明
Well, I'll make a statement...

409
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,290
說這是人身攻擊式的政治手段
and blame it on the politics of personal destruction.

410
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,930
不  道格  恐怕這些仍不夠
No, Doug, I'm afraid that's just not going to be enough.

411
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,360
我們得轉移懷疑目標
We have to shift... the suspicion.

412
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,770
我們需要你...
We need you to...

413
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:10,670
我們需要你讓自己跟佐伊·巴恩斯的死掛上鉤
We need you to implicate yourself in the death of Zoe Barnes.

414
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,940
先別激動  聽我說
Now, before you react, just listen.

415
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,270
目前你是最有可能的人選
You are the most likely candidate at this point.

416
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,330
你當時心煩意亂  還酗酒
You were distraught, you were drinking.

417
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,720
我說不好
The... I don't know.

418
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,690
我們會編一些事出來  然后泄漏出去
We'll make up some story, and then we'll leak it.

419
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,660
你忠心耿耿  你那么做是為了我
You... you were loyal, you did it for me.

420
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:24,880
你忠誠過了頭  采取了極端手段
You were too loyal. You went too far.

421
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,930
然后  到最后  毫無疑問
And... and then, in the end, there'll be no question...

422
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,520
我失陪一下好嗎
Can you excuse me?

423
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,560
這要么是哪個怪胎想搏頭條
Well, it's either a crank looking for a headline,

424
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,060
要么就是內部人士在說真話
or someone on the inside telling the truth.

425
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,190
你感覺是什么
What's your sense?

426
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,040
他知道生日卡的事
He knew about the birthday cards.

427
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,790
我說不好
I don't know.

428
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,810
也許重點在于這電話
Maybe the story is the call.

429
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,660
那些閃存盤  泄密本身
The flash drives. The leaks themselves.

430
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,220
如果我們點出泄密的事
If we call out the leaks,

431
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,620
他可能就不會再聯系我了
he may stop contacting me.

432
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,550
還有麥卡倫的事  那真是條線索嗎
And the Macallan business, is that even a real lead?

433
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,380
這些網站什么都不會承認的
None of these sites will admit to anything.

434
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,030
因為這太丟人了
Because it's an embarrassment.

435
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,380
多個選情對安德伍德不利的郡的
An overwhelming amount of Underwood material

436
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,030
社交媒體用戶  爆出了大量
was reported by social media users in counties

437
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,980
安德伍德的材料
that he was expected to lose.

438
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,240
但我聯系的所有人
But anyone I reach out to

439
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,090
都不想談論此事
does not wanna be talking about this.

440
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,990
泄密者說那是未經授權的國內監控
The leak said it was unauthorized domestic surveillance.

441
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,780
政府只需要搬出"恐怖活動"
All the administration has to say is "terror,"

442
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,550
看起來就正當了
And they seem justified.

443
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,160
他可不是在鏟除恐怖分子
He wasn't rooting out terrorists.

444
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,860
他是想贏得選舉
He was trying to win an election.

445
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,370
國務卿正好撞了頭可太巧了
And very convenient that the Secretary of State hits her head.

446
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,690
你現在聽起來像是陰謀論...
Now you sound like a conspiracy...

447
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,520
我不是陰謀論者
I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

448
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,190
我試圖想象他是怎么想的
I try to imagine what it's like inside his mind,

449
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,140
如果我是他  我會怎么做
what I would do if I were him.

450
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,730
我跟你們說  這是各種...
And I'm telling you, it is all sorts of...

451
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,940
他沒有意識形態  沒有道德方向
He has no ideology. No North Star.

452
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,520
這難道不是最可怕的嗎
Isn't that the scariest thing of all?

453
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,980
湯姆  你覺得佐伊·巴恩斯是被謀殺的嗎
Tom, do you think Zoe Barnes was murdered?

454
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,110
一個27歲的人失足撞上火車的概率有多大
How often does a 27-year-old fall in front of a train?

455
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,320
-那好吧  我們去證明它  -好
- All right, then. Let's prove that. - All right.

456
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,630
怎么了
What's wrong?

457
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,660
道格·斯坦普的辦公室來電了
Doug Stamper's office called.

458
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,220
他們想安排見面
They wanna set up a meeting.

459
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,500
盡快吧
Soon as possible.

460
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,510
這是好事
This is good.

461
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,210
不管你男友今早從你手機里讀到了什么
Whatever your boyfriend read off your phone this morning

462
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,520
都傳到了正確的人的耳朵里
made its way to the right person.

463
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,490
我不知道我還能堅持多久
I don't know how much longer I can do this.

464
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,960
你只是在騙一個騙子
You're lying to a liar.

465
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,130
你無法從佐伊死時的手機上得到任何信息
You can't get anything off the phone Zoe died with.

466
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,390
他們只要相信我們能做到就行了
They just need to believe we can.

467
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,760
這到底是什么工作
What is this job?

468
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,550
跟以前不一樣了
Not what it used to be.

469
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,920
我不希望你反應過度
I don't want you to overreact.

470
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,200
但湯姆一直在繼續寫作
But Tom kept writing.

471
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,880
看來他終于完成他的書了
It seems he finally finished his book.

472
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,940
而且他暗示了一些事
And he alludes to things.

473
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,470
什么叫"暗示了一些事"
What do you mean "Alludes to things"?

474
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,710
我不知道  相關行都被涂黑了
I don't know. Lines are blacked out.

475
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,630
就像被編輯過
It's like it's redacted.

476
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,600
時不時的有一些段落
There are paragraphs here and there...

477
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,030
你跟他說過什么
What did you tell him?

478
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,040
他知道些什么
What does he know?

479
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,290
他給任何人看過嗎  寄給過任何人嗎
Has he shown this to anyone? Sent it to anyone?

480
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,080
-出版商  媒體  -我不知道
- Publishers, the press? - I don't know.

481
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,640
那你知道什么
Well, what do you know?

482
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,750
我來處理他  我只是想跟你說一聲
I will handle him. I just wanted you to be aware.

483
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,150
-媽了個逼的  -我說了我會處理的
- Son of a bitch. - I said I'll take care of it.

484
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,300
不  我來處理
No, I'll take care of it.

485
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,640
你躲得遠遠的
You stay a million miles away from this.

486
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,020
你怎么會這么蠢
How could you be so stupid...

487
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,270
動了真情
to fall in love?

488
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,490
這事還沒提交表決
This thing isn't on the floor yet,

489
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,510
我們就已經失去參議員的支持了
and we're losing senators.

490
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,140
失去了幾個吧  不過
We're losing some maybe, but...

491
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,920
參院最討喜的地方也是我最討厭的地方
What I like about the Senate is what I hate.

492
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,610
傳染性
It's contagious.

493
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,590
只要一個人有了什么想法
One of 'em gets an idea,

494
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,820
立馬就會像流感一樣傳遍全院
and it spreads through the body like a flu.

495
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,080
我再想想辦法
I'll look into it.

496
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,080
總共就100個人  我們只需要過半
There's 100 of 'em. All we need is half.

497
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,660
我能躺下嗎
Can I just lay down?

498
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,860
-最好不要  -我就躺幾分鐘
- I don't think that's a good idea. - Just for a few minutes.

499
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,410
我他媽快累死了  我得想想
I'm just so fucking tired, and I need to think.

500
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,910
你得想什么
Why do you need to think?

501
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,330
他給你的那些東西  你拿在手里越久
The longer you hang on to whatever he gave you,

502
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,970
你的處境就越危險
the more danger you're in.

503
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,650
你錯看局勢了
You're reading this wrong.

504
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,830
你以為那是保險  其實不是
You think it's some kind of insurance, but it's not.

505
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,580
莉安
LeAnn...

506
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,840
不管總統出了什么事
Whatever happens to the president,

507
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,630
都不是你  或者我的錯
it's not your fault, or mine.

508
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,080
-你以為我無關緊要嗎  -我可沒這么說
- You don't think I make a difference? - I didn't say that.

509
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,230
還是你覺得我不夠投入
You don't think that I'm dedicated enough?

510
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,610
太投入了
Too dedicated.

511
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,720
過了就有問題了  會讓你一葉障目
That can be a problem. That can make you blind.

512
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,510
你根本不知道
You have no idea...

513
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,090
我做了不可原諒的事  莉安
I've done something unforgivable, LeAnn.

514
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,810
什么
What?

515
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,390
我殺了佐伊·巴恩斯
I killed Zoe Barnes.

516
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,910
你為什么要這么說
Why would you say that?

517
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,600
我只是想保護她
All I ever tried to do was keep her safe.

518
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,890
她說她想就此消失
She said she wanted to be invisible.

519
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,370
我知道這根本不可能
I knew it wasn't possible.

520
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:30,560
我知道她要消失
I knew that she would only ever go away...

521
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,930
就得我親自動手
if I made sure of it.

522
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,080
我不信你
I don't believe you.

523
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,150
你當然信
Yes, you do.

524
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,350
相信我  這是我活該
Believe me... I deserve this.

525
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,650
佐伊·巴恩斯落軌被地鐵撞死了
Zoe Barnes fell in front of a train.

526
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,980
調查結果是意外事故
It was ruled an accident.

527
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,200
是我把她從站臺上推下去的  然后我就走了
I pushed her off the platform and I walked away.

528
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,930
我知道你聯系了布莉姬特·柯恩
I know you reached out to Bridget Cohen.

529
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,180
把我肝臟的來頭告訴她或是委員會
Telling that committee or her how I got my liver

530
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:29,650
對政府  對你  都沒有一絲好處
is not going to help this administration or you.

531
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,300
我告訴你做什么有好處
But here is what is going to help.

532
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,390
我要你去找委員會
This is what you're going to tell that committee

533
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,700
這么說道格·斯坦普
about Doug Stamper.

534
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,960
你就住這兒
You actually live here?

535
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,880
我不經常住
Well... I'm not here that much.

536
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,970
偶爾讓我朋友來住住
I let friends use it now and again.

537
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,520
-謝謝你的謹慎  -應該的
- Thanks for your discretion. - Of course.

538
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,330
我不會待太久
I won't be too long.

539
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,100
你慢慢來
Take your time.

540
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,230
如果需要什么  我隨叫隨到
If you need anything, I'll be on call.

541
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,060
他是講道理的
He's reasonable.

542
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,540
是啊  他必須這樣
Yeah, he needs to be.

543
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,780
他們也沒怎么查
They didn't look that hard.

544
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,120
特勤局知道我沒什么好隱瞞的
The Secret Service knows I have nothing to hide.

545
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,800
他就在樓下
He's downstairs.

546
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,770
別客氣
Make yourself at home.

547
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,100
我小時候可喜歡捉迷藏了
I used to love to hide as a kid.

548
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,840
我總是藏得非常好
I was really good at it.

549
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,690
我總能找到最隱蔽的藏身處
I could always choose the best places.

550
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,290
從來沒被抓到過
Nobody ever found me.

551
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,340
有一次大家干脆不玩了
One time, everybody just gave up.

552
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,130
所以我在那兒躲了整整13個小時
So I stayed put for, like, 13 hours straight.

553
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,720
你想要什么
What do you want?

554
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,770
他說如果我同意  我絕不會后悔的
He said I wouldn't regret it... if I said yes.

555
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:08,880
弗蘭西斯
Francis.

556
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,510
就是想當初  我同意
When I agreed to write the book

557
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,070
寫他起家的故事的時候
about his origin story way back when.

558
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,260
那他現在可后悔請你了
Well, he regrets asking you now.

559
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,010
我同意  是因為我總是非常喜歡
I said yes 'cause I have always been a sucker

560
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,560
聽別人是怎么講他們自己的
for what people tell themselves about themselves.

561
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,400
誰還有手稿
Who has the manuscript?

562
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,830
只有你
You do.

563
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,840
出版商呢
And publishers?

564
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,030
還沒給
Not yet.

565
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,840
所以你覺得如何
So what did you think?

566
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,330
有好多段落你都劃掉了  湯姆
There are huge sections blacked out, Tom.

567
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,000
你把我們描繪成了怪物
You portrayed us like a couple of monsters.

568
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,890
-我沒這么寫  -你也不用寫出來
- I never used that word. - You didn't have to.

569
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,640
我們剛認識時  在從莫斯科回來的飛機上
On the flight back from Moscow, not long after we met...

570
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,610
你和弗蘭西斯大吵了一架
you and Francis had a fight.

571
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,540
吵得很兇
A real knock down.

572
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,510
我告訴弗蘭西斯我聽見了吼聲
I told Francis I heard the yelling,

573
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,720
但沒聽清說什么
but not the words.

574
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,590
但
But...

575
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,920
你說你們殺了人
you said you were murderers.

576
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,310
他說你們是適者生存
He said you were survivors.

577
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,500
我害怕到這里來
I was dreading coming here.

578
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,290
-為什么  -你不能出版  湯姆
- Why? - You can't publish it, Tom.

579
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,580
我也不想
I'd rather not.

580
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,850
那為什么  錢嗎
So, what? Money?

581
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,110
對  但是夠了
Yeah... but enough.

582
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,060
足夠讓我消失一陣了
Enough so I can really get lost for a while.

583
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,010
靜一靜  讓我好好想想該何去何從
Buy some time till I figure out what I'm gonna do next.

584
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,490
我們可以商量個對策的
We can figure something out.

585
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,930
當然
I bet.

586
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,610
那些你涂黑的部分
You know, those parts you blacked out, that's...

587
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,630
-除了你我誰都沒告訴過  -我知道
- I've never told anyone but you. - I know.

588
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,540
我什么都知道
I know everything.

589
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,440
但你要的不就是這樣嗎
But isn't that what you wanted?

590
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,780
我想念撫摸你
I miss touching you.

591
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:24,380
我不知道沒有你在身邊該如何是好
I don't know how to not be around you.

592
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,200
我無時無刻不想著你
I think of you all the time.

593
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,890
都快要因此而恨你了
It almost makes me hate you for it.

594
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
我不知道該怎么辦
I don't know what to do.

595
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,280
你太美了
You're so beautiful.

596
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,910

美人千千萬萬
There's lots of people like that.

598

You are radiant, Claire.

599
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,460
而且善良  你太善良了
And good. You are so good.

600
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,800
-我不善良  -不  你是善良的
- I'm not good. - Yes, you are.

601
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,280
-你為什么不吻我  -我想看著你
- Why won't you kiss me? - I wanna look at you.

602
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,930
我真想有一天能去格陵蘭
I really do wanna go to Greenland one day.

603
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,250
-我們應該去  -別停
- We should go. - Don't stop.

604
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,660
冰天雪地  如此遙遠
It's so frozen and remote.

605
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:40,700
那里的
The way the...

606
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:45,210
那里的  氣味
The way the... Smells before it...

607
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,690
你知道我什么意思吧
The... You know what I mean?

608
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,870
救命  救命
Help. Help.

609
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,520
湯姆
Tom?

610
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,900
死亡人數將近五十萬
There are close to half a million dead.

611
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,430
有超過四百萬名難民
Over four million refugees,

612
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,370
背井離鄉  需要照料的婦女兒童
women and children who have left the region and require care.

613
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,950
流離失所的人至少有一千兩百萬
At least 12 million displaced people.

614
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,280
無處可去  無家可歸的流浪者
Homeless wanderers who no longer belong anywhere.

615
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,470
我們都學過歷史
We are all students of history.

616
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,040
敘利亞可是聯合國創始國之一
Syria was one of the founding members of the United Nations,

617
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,260
天吶
for God's sakes.

618
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,270
我們是怎么走到今天的
How did we get here?

619
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:09,350
我們來自最古老的文明之一
We, who sprang from one of the most ancient civilizations?

620
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,910
我們終得承認  和平才是唯一的答案
At some point, we must accept peace as the only answer.

621
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:17,310
各方必須放下武器  開始和談
All parties must lay down their arms and begin to talk.

622
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,990
好吧
Okay.

623
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,790
你總能找到我
You were always good at tracking me down.

624
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,100
很不容易
It wasn't easy.

625
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,870
電影院  偶爾的秘密會議
Movie theater, the occasional classified meeting.

626
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,320
我知道你在干什么
I know what you're doing.

627
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,310
這么說有點含糊
Well, that's a bit vague.

628
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,190
你是在給他搗亂  讓參議員倒戈
You're sabotaging him. Peeling off senators.

629
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,270
我知道是你干的
I know it's you.

630
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,860
你抽煙的時候要有趣得多
You were much more interesting when you smoked.

631
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,020
我沒有
No, I wasn't.

632
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,920
錢不在他那兒  馬克
The money's not with him, Mark.

633
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,240
科赫兄弟那些人  華爾街  石油天然氣
The... the Koch brother types, Wall Street, oil and gas...

634
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,740
連工人都要拋棄他了
Even labor's walking out on him.

635
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,250
他比你想得要神通廣大
He's more resourceful than you think.

636
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,680
沒有錢他也做了很多  好吧
He's done a lot without money, okay?

637
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,150
我要你別插手
I want you to back off,

638
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,880
讓我應付聽證會
let me handle these hearings.

639
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,100
我剛到白宮
I just got to the White House.

640
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,150
我想留下
I intend to stick around.

641
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,220
我不希望他當總統
I don't want him to be president.

642
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,840
-國家需要改變  -好  那么
- The country needs a change. - Okay, so...

643
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,210
有他妻子  就不用找其他人選了
And they don't need to look any further than his wife.

644
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,890
她堅韌又聰明
She's tough, smart.

645
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,660
他也很聰明  但他不可靠
He's smart, too, but he's not reliable.

646
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,870
至于她  你可以跟她合作
Her? You can work with her.

647
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,540
我知道你也清楚這一點
I know you see it, too.

648
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,530
敘利亞  或者滿目瘡痍的敘利亞
I see a partner when it comes to Syria,

649
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,970
可以成為合作伙伴
or what's left of it.

650
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,600
給我一個
Let me try one of those.

651
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,800
我們就不該
I mean, far be it from us

652
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,490
告訴一個古老的文明怎么處理它的問題
to tell an ancient civilization its business...

653
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,930
但現在  敘利亞是這世界上
but Syria is now basically unrivaled

654
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,640
-最暴力的地方  -我知道
- as the most violent place on the planet. - I know, I know.

655
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,300
我不是說  要拿弗蘭克·安德伍德怎么辦
I'm not saying what to do with Frank Underwood

656
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,580
不會成為一個巨大的麻煩
is not gonna be a difficult problem.

657
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,360
但  如果我們不在當地立足
But... if we don't establish a presence in the region...

658
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,580
那就太遲了
it's gonna be too late.

659
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,000
-我更想抽根煙  -吐出來吧
- I'd rather have a cigarette. - Spit it out.

660
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,100
讓我請你吃晚飯吧
Well... let me buy you dinner or something.

661
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,770
怎么  怎么了
What? What happened? What's the matter?

662
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,830
我抱著那孩子
I had that child in my arms.

663
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,370
我能感覺到她的呼吸
I could feel her breath on me,

664
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,070
但卻不敢往下看
but I couldn't look down.

665
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,250
失陪
Excuse me.

666
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,190
喂
Yeah?

667
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,970
20分鐘就到
20 minutes away.

668
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,110
-好  我得走了  抱歉  -去吧
- Okay. I have to go. I'm sorry. - Do, please.

669
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,430
我累了  我去睡了
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

670
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,790
我需要你的服務
I need your services.

671
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,560
天吶
Jesus.

672
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,410
不
No.

673
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,030
馬上
Now.

674
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,090
我認為道格·斯坦普殺了佐伊·巴恩斯
I believe Doug Stamper killed Zoe Barnes.

675
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,140
我認為他情緒不穩定
I believe he was unstable

676
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,870
為了弗蘭西斯·安德伍德殺了她
and killed her to benefit Francis Underwood.

677
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:19,530
暫停  不要記錄
Stop. Stop it, please? Off the record.

678
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:22,160
能讓我們單獨待會兒嗎  我再叫你
Can you give us a second? I'll call you back in.

679
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,920
賽斯  這跟賄賂或卡拉比毫無關系
Seth, this has nothing to do with pay for play, or Kalabi,

680
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,400
跟其他任何總統受到的指控都無關
or anything else the president is accused of.

681
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,340
你想干什么
Where are you getting this?

682
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,500
這是我知道的道格的事
This is what I know about Doug.

683
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,000
主席不會允許
The chair will not let you

684
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,570
你在委員會前就此作證的
testify in front of the committee with this.

685
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,630
-我只有這些  -你能證明嗎
- This is what I have. - Can you prove any of it?

686
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,380
他暗示他那么做了
He's implied that he did it.

687
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,630
我可以闡述他的行為
I can speak to his behavior.

688
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,140
他做的事
Things that he's done.

689
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,400
你得去找聯邦檢察官
You need to go to the US attorney.

690
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,060
賽斯  否則  我會去的
Seth, if you don't, I will.

691
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,640
"我告訴總統  國務院追蹤了四個
"I told the president there were four men by the same name

692
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,400
同名的男子
the State Department was tracking.

693
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,010
兩個在美國境內"
Two in the United States."

694
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,530
這引述自一位資深白宮人士
So said a senior White House source,

695
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,590
由《華盛頓先驅報》刊登的
as quoted in the Washington Herald.

696
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,910
你是否知道這對話
Were you aware of this conversation?

697
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,350
不  先生  不知道
No, sir, I was not.

698
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,090
消息源還稱
The source went on.

699
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,900
"我認為總統知道
"I believe the president understood

700
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,940
田納西州的默罕默德·卡拉比
that the Muhammed Kalabi in Tennessee

701
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,900
并非真正的威脅"
was not a legitimate threat."

702
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,050
這你是否知道
Was this conveyed to you in any way?

703
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,230
還是不知道  先生
Again, no, sir.

704
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,800
委員會依然期待
Still, the committee's looking forward to

705
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,940
杜蘭特國務卿就此事作證
Secretary Durant's testimony on this matter.

706
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,390
我不知道國務卿會說什么  但是
I have no idea what the secretary will say or not say, but I...

707
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,500
我對她很尊敬  也祝愿她早日康復
have great respect for her and wish her a speedy recovery.

708
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,850
我們那天是依據
We were operating off of facts and

709
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,110
飛速涌入的事實和報告行動的
reports coming in at an accelerated rate that day.

710
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,870
我再問一次
I'll try this again.

711
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,280
總統是否曾向你暗示
Did the president indicate to you at any time

712
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,190
他知道這并非真正威脅
that he knew this was not a threat?

713
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,290
沒有
No.

714
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,240
而且我要說  我很驕傲
And I'd like to point out that I'm proud

715
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,340
今天能在此代表聯調局的男男女女
to be representing the men and women of the FBI here today,

716
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,060
他們像以往一樣進行了此案的調查
who conducted that investigation as they always do

717
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,760
得力  誠實  而且獨立
in a competent, honest, and independent way,

718
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,150
這是聯調局的優良傳統
in the finest tradition of the FBI.

719
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,620
-是嗎  -我們的人盡了職
- Did they? - Our people did their job.

720
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,070
認為聯調局會
And it's unthinkable to assume

721
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,880
卷入選舉根本是無稽之談
the FBI would involve itself in an election.

722
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,240
因為此時此刻可能有一個
Because there may be an innocent man

723
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,960
無辜的人正在蹲監獄
sitting in a cell as we speak.

724
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,190
我可以就此發表評論  因為報道中有提及
I can comment on this since it was mentioned in the press.

725
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,670
卡拉比先生的電腦上
Trace amounts of an explosive material

726
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,450
的確發現了痕量爆炸物
were found on Mr. Kalabi's computer.

727
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,380
你是說  總統不知道
Your assertion is that the president was unaware

728
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,570
自己的白宮里都發生了什么
of what was happening in his own White House?

729
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,770
艾丹·麥卡倫是國安局的雇員
Aidan Macallan was an NSA employee,

730
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:40,520
所以  不  總統不知道他都做了什么
so, no, the president had no idea what he was up to.

731
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,210
老實說  他當時在忙于競選
Honestly, he was quite busy campaigning.

732
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,730
但他肯定知道麥卡倫先生做的事的影響吧
But surely he knew the effects of Mr. Macallan's work?

733
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,690
這些漏洞
These exploits?

734
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,720
不知道
No.

735
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,450
總統  我是跟著他去巡回過的
The president and... I've been with him out on the stump.

736
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,840
他喜歡跟人握手
He likes to shake hands.

737
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,730
他并不關注社交媒體
He's not paying attention to social media.

738
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,690
哈維小姐  外國情報監視法法庭發布了一則判決
Ms. Harvey, there was a FISA ruling issued,

739
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,440
而安德伍德政府利用它
which the Underwood administration used

740
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,980
來監視美國公民
to spy on American citizens

741
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,720
意在影響選舉
for the sake of swaying an election.

742
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:07,620
羅梅洛議員  艾丹·麥卡倫是個有困擾的人
Congressman Romero, Aidan Macallan was a troubled person.

743
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,290
他的腦子轉得很快
His mind worked fast,

744
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,420
恐怕已超出了正常范圍
faster than I think anyone's should.

745
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,850
他的企圖已被他帶入墳墓
What he was up to went to the grave with him.

746
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,620
哈維小姐  少跟我打感情牌
Ms. Harvey, please, spare me the semantics...

747
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,140
-好吧  -我只需要你
- Okay, fine. - I just need you...

748
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,520
他收集數據了嗎  是的
Was he collecting data? Yes.

749
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,760
他過界了嗎  很可能
Did he cross a line? Most likely.

750
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,040
我去看過他  看他的工作
I did visit with him, checking in on his work.

751
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,350
你見過一屏的代碼嗎  電腦代碼
Have you seen a screen of code? Computer code.

752
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,090
那根本看不懂
It's indecipherable.

753
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:34,130
賽斯·格雷森怎么最終沒作證
Why did Seth Grayson end up not testifying?

754
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:35,030
無可評價
No comment.

755
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:36,290
我們聽說他的證詞
We heard that his testimony

756
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:38,340
跟總統的幕僚長有關
had to do with the president's chief of staff.

757
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,230
我很歡迎他來我們委員會作證
Who I would welcome testifying in front of our committee.

758
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,340
我敦促道格·斯坦普和其他政府人員
I urge Doug Stamper and the rest of the administration

759
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,920
別再躲在行政特權之后了
to stop hiding behind executive privilege.

760
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,560
我們目前只知道
All we learned so far is that

761
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,860
總統對他的白宮發生的事毫不知情
the president knew nothing about anything going on in his White House.

762
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,380
一共六個人
There were six of them,

763
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,100
他們輪流來
and they all took a turn.

764
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,140
除了羅梅洛
Except for Romero.

765
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,970
他只是看了
He only watched.

766
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,610
至少他是這么跟校長說的
Or... at least that's what he told the dean.

767
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,400
但我知道真相
But I know the real story.

768
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:10,400
她叫羅謝爾
Her name was, uh, Rochelle.

769
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,600
你不是沒有他的把柄嗎
I thought you had nothing on this guy.

770
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,690
你知道多久了
How long have you known this?

771
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,800
我是想留到我們需要的時候
I was holding it until... Or, if we needed it.

772
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,720
是你需要的時候吧
No, until you needed it, you mean.

773
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,050
這沒什么區別
Look, it makes no difference.

774
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,350
我可能會用  可能不會
I might use it, I might not.

775
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,730
但我還是想作證
But I still wanna testify.

776
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:22,560
你現在作證
For you to testify now,

777
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,360
抱歉  簡直瘋了
excuse me for saying it, it's crazy.

778
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,140
你覺得瘋了嗎  克萊爾
Do you think it's crazy, Claire?

779
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:29,020
-我想在他面前維護自己  -我們有證人
- I wanna defend myself against this guy. - We have witnesses.

780
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,370
我們的證人  代理人  讓他們說
Our witnesses, surrogates. Let it come from them.

781
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,660
我覺得我能贏
I think I can win.

782
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,210
或者我該等到我被參議院拋棄
Or maybe I should wait until I lose the Senate...

783
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,410
我就是覺得還有別的辦法
I just think there are other ways...

784
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,030
如果你放棄行政特權
If you give up executive privilege,

785
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,050
我們就喪失了籌碼  完全沒了
we lose leverage. We lose it all.

786
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,080
告訴主席  我愿作證了
Tell the chair I'm ready to appear.

787
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,470
你的證詞可能對你妻子造成的傷害
I mean, the damage your testimony could do to your wife

788
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,170
不值得冒險
is not worth the risk.

789
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,690
我們就是要討論它的價值
Its worth is what we're here to discuss.

790
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,100
我不喜歡由我來說  但是
I... I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but...

791
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,270
你的總統之位已經保不住了
your presidency is beyond repair.

792
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,210
你不知道我接下來要做什么
You don't know what I'm going to do next.

793
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:09,340
不是這個嗎  這才是讓你困擾的吧
Isn't that it? Isn't that what really bothers you?

794
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,760
別以為我沒從你加入的那一刻
Don't think I haven't been watching you

795
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,930
就在觀察你
from the moment you stepped on board.

796
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,550
你滿口承諾  戴維斯女士
You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.

797
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,050
麥卡倫的事仍未平息
The information about Macallan is still out there

798
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,480
而艾哈邁迪則神出鬼沒
and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.

799
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,640
你從走進我家
You've been sabotaging me

800
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,610
就一直在給我搗亂
from the moment you stepped into my house.

801
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,880
你不喜歡我  是吧
You don't care for me very much, do you?

802
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,410
是的
No, I don't.

803
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:36,110
我一點也不喜歡
I couldn't care less.

804
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,540
但如果你讓克萊爾開心  我就開心
But if you make Claire happy, that makes me happy.

805
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,130
如果你能好好幫她
If you can help her,

806
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,400
-那很好  -你愿付出什么
- good. - What's it worth to you?

807
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,460
你打算做什么樣的交易
Well, what kind of deal are we talking about?

808
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,000
要我不作證
For me not to testify.

809
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,830
我在華府外有人
Well, I have contacts outside the Beltway.

810
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,590
我可以給你找到各種肥差
I can set you up in any number of lucrative positions.

811
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,560
不  那不夠好
No, that's not good enough.

812
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,300
誰都能給我那個
Anyone could offer me that.

813
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:58,250
你說呢
You tell me.

814
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,720
不不  不能這樣
No, no, no. It's not going to work like that.

815
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,860
你說你能為我做什么
You tell me what you can do for me.

816
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,500
我接觸過你這樣的人
I've been around your kind.

817
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:06,660
一般沒接觸到這種深度
Not usually at this level.

818
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,660
但你就是忍不住
But you can't help yourself.

819
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,390
給我開價  戴維斯女士
Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.

820
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,440
你愿為她付出什么
What is she worth to you?

821
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,360
很多
A lot.

822
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,540
那么我是這么想的
So then here's what I'm thinking.

823
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,410
你是否莊嚴宣誓確認
Do you solemnly swear and affirm

824
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,150
你即將給出的證詞是真相
that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,

825
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:35,950
全部真相  絕無隱瞞
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

826
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,090
我宣誓
I do.

827
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,470
請記錄
Let the record reflect that

828
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,230
證人給出了肯定回答
the witness has answered in the affirmative.

829
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,820
總統先生  我想感謝你前來作證
Mr. President, I want to thank you for appearing...

830
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,500
希望我們可以為美國人民
and I hope we get to clear some things up

831
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,750
澄清一些事
for the American people.

832
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,740
總統先生  你可以開始
Mr. President, the floor is yours.

833
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,830
你想講多久都行
You can take as long or as short as you like.

834
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,820
如果你有書面聲明
If you have any written statement,

835
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,140
我們會在稍后將它納入記錄
we will include it after and it will be part of the record.

836
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,350
總統先生  請講
Mr. President, you are recognized.

837
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,120
謝謝  主席先生
Thank you, Mr. Chairman...

838
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,400
也感謝其他委員會成員
and to the other members of this committee.

839
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,700
我今天同意在委員會面前作證
I have agreed to appear before this committee today...

840
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,500
是因為
because...

841
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,940
我有罪
I'm guilty.

842
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,570
我花了30年的人生
Guilty of having spent the last 30 years of my life

843
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,700
在這里
here...

844
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,660
在國會
in this Congress.

845
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,580
在眾議院
In this House.

846
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,950
然后成為副總統  總統
Then as vice president and now as president,

847
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,070
只為效力于人民
trying to do the people's work.

848
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:39,180
委員會指控我犯下了很多事
Now, this committee has accused me of a great number of things.

849
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,150
你們指控我賄賂
You accused me of pay to play.

850
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,880
那么我也指控你們犯下了同樣罪行
And so I accuse you of exactly the same.

851
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:52,670
我還指控你們只為自己的利益行使政治手段
I also accuse you of playing politics only when it suits you.

852
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,960
你們都拿了錢
You're all being paid.

853
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,740
你們都有要效力的主子
You're all serving some master.

854
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,680
你們每個人
Each and every one of you,

855
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,980
你們知道我所言不虛
and you know I know that for a fact.

856
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,320
比如你  羅梅洛議員
You, for example, Congressman Romero...

857
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:12,010
你扳倒我的不懈努力  是為了正義嗎
and your crusade to take me down, is it for justice?

858
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,190
為了國家嗎
For the good of the nation?

859
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,200
你真的是想要真相嗎
Is the truth what you're really after?

860
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,030
還是為了個人利益
Or is it for some personal gain?

861
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,410
或許是為了填補
Perhaps to try to fill

862
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:26,380
你很久之前賣掉的
the small hole in your soul

863
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,730
那一塊靈魂留下的空洞
that you sold off a long time ago?

864
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,200
-總統先生  -不  不  不
- Mr. President. - No, no, no.

865
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,460
這是我的開場陳述
This is my opening statement,

866
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,500
我要說完
and I will give it in full.

867
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,660
我還沒說完  女士們先生們
I am not done, ladies and gentlemen.

868
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,310
你們指控我違反規則
You accuse me of breaking the rules,

869
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,580
我告訴你們  我完全遵守規則
and I tell you, I am playing by the rules.

870
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,470
正是你們和我一起達成的規則
The very rules that you and I all agreed upon.

871
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:57,550
正是你們和我
The very rules that you and I

872
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,680
一起寫的規則
all wrote together.

873
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,460
是的  我非常有罪
So, yes, I'm guilty as hell,

874
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,340
但你們也都有罪
but then so are all of you.

875
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:06,520
是的  體制有問題
Yes, the system is corrupt,

876
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,630
但你們想要我這樣的人守門
but you wanted a guardian at the gate like me.

877
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,570
為什么呢
And why?

878
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,000
因為你們知道
Because you know

879
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,780
我會不惜一切
I will do whatever it takes.

880
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,750
你們都喜歡這樣
And you have all enjoyed it,

881
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,190
參與其中  并從中獲利
been party to it and benefited by it.

882
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:26,690
別否認  你喜歡的
Don't deny it. You've loved it.

883
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,190
你并不需要我堅持什么
You don't actually need me to stand for anything.

884
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,220
你只希望我站出來
You just need me to stand.

885
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,390
希望我強勢
To be the strong man.

886
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,290
希望我采取行動
The man of action.

887
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:39,980
天吶  你好喜歡行動和口號
My God, you're addicted to action and slogans.

888
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,840
不管我說了什么
It doesn't matter what I say.

889
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,150
我做了什么
It doesn't matter what I do.

890
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,430
只要我有所作為
Just as long as I'm doing something,

891
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,920
你就樂意跟著走
you're happy to be along for the ride.

892
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,800
老實說  我不怪你
And frankly, I don't blame you.

893
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,430
你生活中有那么多愚蠢和猶豫
With all the foolishness and indecision in your lives,

894
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,520
為什么不要個我這樣的人
why not a man like me?

895
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:57,430
我不道歉
I don't apologize.

896
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,310
最終  我不在意你是愛我還是恨我
In the end, I don't care whether you love me or you hate me,

897
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,470
只要我贏就行
just as long as I win.

898
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,410
結局早被安排好  規則是被操縱的
The deck is stacked. The rules are rigged.

899
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,880
歡迎來到理智時代的終結
Welcome to the death of the Age of Reason.

900
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,490
已經沒有是非了
There is no right or wrong. Not anymore.

901
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,010
只有入局
There's only being in...

902
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,560
和出局
and then being out.

903
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:33,050
所以我不要再參與其中了
So I will not be party to this any longer.

904
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,480
我不要再替你們背負罵名了
I will not wear the target for any of you anymore.

905
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,670
你們都已經利用我太久了
You have all used me far long enough.

906
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,440
所以派對結束  旅程結束
So, the party's over, the ride's done.

907
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,020
我太尊重這一職位
I respect the office too much

908
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,140
不能允許這繼續下去
to allow this to continue going on.

909
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,470
所以我要向委員會和全國人民宣布
That's why I am announcing to this committee and to the nation

910
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:53,780
明晚6點起
that as of 6:00 p.m. tomorrow evening,

911
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,960
我將辭去美國總統一職
I shall resign the office of President of the United States.

912
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:00,290
秩序
Order!

913
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:05,030
屆時我樂意回答你們的一切問題
And I will be happy to take any questions you may have.

914
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:09,040
但我的直覺是  已經沒那個必要了
But my gut tells me that isn't really going to be necessary.

916
00:52:09,250 --> 00:53:09,250
{\an5}{\pos(193,150)}聽證會作證有兩個類型
一種要求證人宣誓  宣誓后如果說謊  就是違法行為
另一種不宣誓  有不實之言不用負法律責任
如果被發現宣誓后說謊  可能被國會表決定為"蔑視國會"
但位高權重之人  往往也只受到書面譴責  并不一定真的會被起訴
普通人則不敢冒險
國會有發傳票的權力  收到傳票的人按法律規定需要服從
但如果不服從  并不會直接受到懲罰
往往是  如果在接受調查時不配合  那么可能會導致司法介入
然后走法律程序  被起訴定罪
同樣  如果國會在調查后發現被調查者有違法行為
那么相關的司法部門會隨即介入  進行進一步的起訴  定罪
也就是說  國會調查很嚴重  但并不能代替法律程序
