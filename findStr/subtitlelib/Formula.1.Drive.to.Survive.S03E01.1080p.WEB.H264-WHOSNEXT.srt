1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,960
- Okay.
- I can do this.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,040
Bit higher.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,240
Took to season 3 to get a board.
Professional. We haven't done that before.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,280
- Roll cameras.
- Oh shit, that's bright.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,560
- Can I say it in Spanish?
- Yeah!

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,920
Do I look athletic?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,120
Dynamic? Intelligent?

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,160
Never held one of these things before.
Only see it in the movies.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,840
<i>Drive to Survive: Season Three,
my one and only take.</i>

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,440
Action.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,280
<i>Yes, boys, come on!</i>

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,720
- <i>Big accident.</i>
- Fuck!

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,960
If they're good enough,
they swim, they survive.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,080
If they're not good enough...

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,880
Let's crush them.

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,520
Formula 1 racing
is very much like war planning.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,840
<i>Hamilton is the race leader.
Oh, that's a spin!</i>

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,760
- Box, I lost the frickin' wing.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,480
<i>And that's Bottas.
Bottas has put it in the wall!</i>

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,976
Fuck! How is this possible?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,800
A tough day at the office?

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,360
No, it was a total crap,
shit, awful day at the office.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,160
- Looks dangerous.
- Looks angry.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
This is the worst experience
I've had in any race car.

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,000
Last year,
this is roller coaster.

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,320
<i>There's contact!</i>

27
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,800
We've got two fucking idiots
driving for us. This is not acceptable.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,920
We will make changes.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,160
Hope you get it fixed.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,440
You tell me.

31
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,160
- Nice. Big smiles.
- Who's your favorite driver?

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
Uh...

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,840
Whoever's winning for us.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,160
<i>Oh!</i>

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,240
<i>- Gasly makes a mistake.</i>
- Fuck, no!

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,440
We've decided to release Pierre.

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,520
We're gonna remove that subject
and put you in place.

38
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,960
I fully deserved the seat.

39
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,240
The new driver lineup for McLaren.

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,400
For me, a new year is a new start.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,240
Where's the fucking boot?

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,360
I'm working
more than anyone else in Formula 1.

43
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,840
It will show itself on track.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,920
<i>- Vamos!</i>
- Waa!

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,040
- Yes!
- Wow!

46
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,040
I could see him being with McLaren
for quite some time.

47
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Send it!

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,160
Last year,
I took a gamble and switched teams.

49
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,400
I feel a real responsibility
to push this car.

50
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,520
Let's fucking have it, boys.

51
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,600
<i>A massive engine problem
for Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

52
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,240
With Renault,
we haven't achieved what we wanted to.

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,480
I don't work this hard
to not see the checkered flag.

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,240
<i>Once again, Ferrari on Ferrari.</i>

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,080
What the hell?

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,280
<i>It's both of them! Both cars out.</i>

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,960
Competing against the best,
that's one thing.

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
Trying to do it with Ferrari
is, uh, is another one.

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
Hell yeah, let's do it!

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
Ooh... Spicy.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Mate, that pink suit photo
is terrible, bro.

62
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,040
How does that one pass?
Mate, look at my face.

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,160
What is that?
Can you scroll down?

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,560
It looks like he's taking a shit.
Show your eyes!

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,760
It's always hard
looking at yourself.

66
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,896
- Especially wearing a pink suit.
- Yeah.

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,760
I don't really give a shit.
I know what I look like, but...

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Hi.

69
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,240
<i>So how's it going</i>?

70
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,480
Good. We're just on our way to the track.

71
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,280
<i>With your traveling, you have been
wearing a face mask, haven't you?</i>

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,760
Mum, it's cool.
Apparently, if you drink Corona,

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,240
it builds your immune.

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,400
It was never my favorite beer,
but I'll drink it if I have to.

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,840
<i>Good morning,
and welcome back to Formula 12020.</i>

76
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,880
<i>Live from
the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya,</i>

77
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,120
<i>with the 2020 Formula 1 season
just around the corner.</i>

78
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Go away.

79
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Everyone to the bridge.
All of you guys get down there, please.

80
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Thank you.

81
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Hey, guys.

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
All right, guys, find your marks.

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,080
You'll see 'em written there. Find your
marks and stand next to your teammates.

84
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,240
Lauren is gonna do a couple of pullbacks
between the center of all you guys.

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,720
So what we want you guys to do
in this moment

86
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,440
is really picture your goals for this year
and what you're attempting to accomplish.

87
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,480
Picture them and visualize them,
so when this comes across,

88
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,680
they see you all genuinely really caring
about what we're talking about, okay?

89
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,800
Is everybody ready? And action!

90
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,320
Pre-season testing
is the first opportunity

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,160
to get the 20 greatest drivers
in the world on track

92
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,640
before the season begins.

93
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,640
Everyone, reset your look.
Look back at camera, please.

94
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,440
Right at camera. Look tough.
Amazing. Thank you.

95
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
You can really sense the start
of the new season is almost upon us.

96
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,840
All right, everybody start walking.
Start walking!

97
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,840
Come. Come. Start walking.

98
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,440
And that means new drama,
new conflict and new possibilities.

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,240
And killed it.
You guys are good.

100
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,320
Thank you, guys. You can go.

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,320
- Thank you, everybody!
- Thank you.

102
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,120
- All right, man. Have fun.
- See ya, mate.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,240
<i>And there she is,
ladies and gentlemen, the C39!</i>

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,160
<i>What a year it's gonna be this year.</i>

105
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,680
<i>2020 pre-season testing
is nearly underway.</i>

106
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,760
<i>The teams, the cars, the drivers,
undergoing some final preparations,</i>

107
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,760
<i>waiting for that green light.</i>

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,560
There's always an excitement
and anticipationabout the testing.

109
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,200
Because it's, it's everything
starting to come to life.

110
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,200
The hype is there.
The past, the hope.

111
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,200
With a new season, what comes with it,
it's just this fantastic feeling.

112
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,600
It's where
you have the first proper test.

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,480
Against competitors,
but also against yourselves.

114
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
There is a buzz.

115
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,560
There's always a buzz,
and everybody's happy to come back.

116
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,680
Keen to see the performance
of the various teams and drivers.

117
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,680
But you never...
You never kind of know what to expect.

118
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,200
This year, there's a genuine sense
up and down the pit lane

119
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,120
that this season
might not be business as usual.

120
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,240
The team that everyone's talking
about this year is Racing Point.

121
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,760
And their billionaire owner,
Lawrence Stroll.

122
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,880
There's a lot of intrigue
as to exactly what's been going on

123
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,440
behind their garage doors over the winter.

124
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,560
All right.

125
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,840
You're gonna walk me through
what we're proposing for this season.

126
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,560
Lawrence Stroll,
he has stature, he has a presence

127
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,880
that really commands your attention.

128
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,040
Fifteen minutes
for the whole thing.

129
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,520
Lawrence is a, uh, force of nature.

130
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,320
You know, I've worked previously
with owners that were billionaires,

131
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,520
but they didn't have the goals
that Lawrence has.

132
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
Hi, Lawrence.

133
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,720
He brings funding,
but, uh, he also brings, uh, expectations.

134
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
You got me till 12:30.

135
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Fire away.

136
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
Uh...

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,160
I thought we would start with, uh, Simon

138
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,640
to present where we are
and, uh, where we will soon be.

139
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,800
Thank you.

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,840
So we, uh, the latest direction

141
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,800
is we've commenced an eight-week period
now of intense engineering.

142
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:13,400
There are two major areas that we're
looking at, and that remains on target.

143
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,320
We're trying to get that ready
for the end of the year.

144
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,080
So we're now
really going to drill into that,

145
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,200
and we'll be able to come back to you,
Lawrence, with some news.

146
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Sure.

147
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,480
My name is Lawrence Stroll.

148
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,920
I am the chairman.

149
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,520
At the end of 2018, Force India
was at the height of its financial crisis.

150
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,800
<i>The Force India Formula 1 team
has gone into administration.</i>

151
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,280
<i>The team has survived
with a consortium of investors.</i>

152
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,680
<i>The consortium is led</i>

153
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,320
<i>by billionaire businessman,
Lawrence Stroll.</i>

154
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,760
There were a lot of people
who were very concerned

155
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,720
whether they'd have a job,
how their children would go to school

156
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,560
or their mortgages
or doctor bills were gonna be paid.

157
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,320
We acquired a team
that was fourth on the grid,

158
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,280
with a considerably smaller budget
than our competitors.

159
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,680
I really thought
this is a tremendous opportunity

160
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,560
in something
that I had a lot of passion for.

161
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,640
So our targets remain
business strategy, contract cost,

162
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,160
uh, and planned development.

163
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,720
We have, um, very exciting
and ambitious growth plans,

164
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,480
and I believe
we can go from strength to strength.

165
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,560
- And that will bring lap time?
- It will.

166
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,920
I've always won in the businesses
I've run. I plan on winning here.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,400
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

168
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,560
- We're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

169
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,040
Lawrence is a big character
who made an instant impact

170
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,640
the second that he first entered
a Formula 1 paddock.

171
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,520
He's serious.

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,800
And he's investing his wealth
in that team.

173
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,360
The only question mark is what
his plans are to take the team to the top.

174
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,640
After the consortium
came in and bought the team,

175
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,840
there was a change in the driver lineup.

176
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,040
In comes Lawrence's son,

177
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,080
Lance Stroll.

178
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,440
Well, my dad and I have
a pretty good relationship, I'd say.

179
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,360
You know, we go way back.

180
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,480
Yeah.

181
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,240
He bought me a go-kart
when I was six years old.

182
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,760
He's supported me
throughout my whole career.

183
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,240
and introduced me to the sport
at a very young age.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,880
A lot of people think
Lance Stroll's always had it easy,

185
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,880
given that his father's
one of the most successful businessmen

186
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,240
in the world.

187
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,720
But you don't win championships
just by being rich.

188
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,880
You gotta be talented, you gotta be quick.

189
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,320
There is a very fast driver
underneath that helmet.

190
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,920
What makes me
as good a driver as I am?

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
My commitment.

192
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,600
My commitment is what makes me
such a good driver.

193
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm willing to go above and beyond
to tick every box.

194
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Cool.

195
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,480
Have you heard anything?

196
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,920
All I heard is
Mercedes is gonna be quick.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,440
- We can be strong this year.
- We nailed it this year.

198
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,520
- Yeah.
- No?

199
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,640
Time will tell.

200
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,480
This season, people are buzzing, you know?

201
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,640
You can feel the energy in this building.

202
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,360
I see smiles, and, uh,
you know, I see, I see a vision.

203
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,920
We're ready to take it on.

204
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,960
<i>The outbreak centers
on the city of Wuhan.</i>

205
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,440
<i>Although person-to-person transmission
has been confirmed,</i>

206
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,200
<i>it does not, thankfully, spread easily.</i>

207
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,856
- What are we, five minutes away?
- We are indeed.

208
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,120
- Yeah, so the launch we've got at 2:30.
- It looks good? You've seen it?

209
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,840
- Yeah. The car looks great.
- I can't wait.

210
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
So I think... Lawrence is there.

211
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
- He arrived?
- Yeah.

212
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,120
- Lance?
- Yep.

213
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,680
With him? Very good.

214
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,880
Hello. Hello. How are you?

215
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,640
- It's definitely pink.
- Hello.

216
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,080
- How are you?
- I just want to have a quick look.

217
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,800
We've done a lot of work over the winter,
preparing this year's car.

218
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,400
- Well done.
- Looks all right.

219
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,920
- Amazing.
- It's well done.

220
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,240
- Yeah.
- Really, really good.

221
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,240
Last season, we were seventh,
coming off of a... a difficult year.

222
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,000
This year's season, Lawrence says
he wants everything to be six-star.

223
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,320
Looking very dapper, Otmar.

224
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,600
I bought this this morning. All this.

225
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
- Can you do up your button?
- No.

226
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,560
- All right.
- I look like a stuffed sausage.

227
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,120
I'm not new to the team.

228
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,160
I've been there for ten years.

229
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,920
- The car's good in the simulator.
- Looks good.

230
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,840
We got a lot of work to do
to set up though.

231
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,320
- Yeah.
- Oh, there's...

232
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,720
When you get new ownership,

233
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,080
um, you've got to manage that situation.

234
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,640
It's highly likely when ownership changes
that the, uh, senior management changes.

235
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
You have to finalize it before we leave.

236
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
- I gotta leave with Lance...
- 4:30.

237
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,760
- 4:30, wheels up.
- Okay, four o'clock.

238
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,520
- I gotta finish the prospectives tonight.
- Let's finish it.

239
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,760
Good. I gotta be in the car at 4:00.

240
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,320
Very good.

241
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,560
You know, job security can be
a bit precarious within Formula 1.

242
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,800
He'll want to see results in 2020.

243
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,760
<i>So now,</i>

244
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,600
<i>ladies and gentlemen,
it's the moment we're all waiting for.</i>

245
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,320
<i>It's time.</i>

246
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,680
<i>The new Racing Point 2020.</i>

247
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,840
We've just seen the new
Racing Point car for the first time.

248
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,800
How's it look?

249
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,680
Hopefully it drives as well as it looks.
I look forward to testing in Barcelona.

250
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,080
You won't be able to miss us
out there on the track.

251
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,816
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

252
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,720
My heart and soul
and passion are going into this.

253
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,040
You always want to be better
than your competition.

254
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,480
So you always look above.
You don't look down.

255
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>2020 pre-season testing
is nearly underway.</i>

256
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,200
<i>The teams, the cars, the drivers,
undergoing some final preparations.</i>

257
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,720
<i>You can hear the engines firing up.</i>

258
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,680
<i>And we're waiting
for a green light. Let's go for it!</i>

259
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,400
<i>- You're clear from traffic behind.</i>
- Okay.

260
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
<i>Daniel Ricciardo, off to a flying start.</i>

261
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,600
Pre-season testing
is the first chance the teams have

262
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,040
to see if what they've spent
all year designing

263
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,120
is actually gonna work
when it gets onto a racetrack.

264
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,320
- Last year the car felt good here?
- Yes.

265
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,000
So you think if we're slow here
this year, we're all right?

266
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,520
Don't go there. No, no.

267
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Sometimes,
the cars work exactly as planned,

268
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,840
and it's smooth sailing.

269
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,320
<i>True to form, Hamilton
to the top. He's on a screamer, isn't he?</i>

270
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,720
But that only happens very, very rarely.

271
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,200
<i>Oh, and he's spun! He's spun it.</i>

272
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,680
Jesus Christ.

273
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,120
<i>- He's grinding to a halt.</i>
- Yeah, dropping out.

274
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,440
Jump out. Yes.

275
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,080
<i>Not ideal.
Second failure for Williams.</i>

276
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,600
And, for the drivers,
it's a huge challenge.

277
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,160
<i>Big spin for Vettel.</i>

278
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,320
They have just three days each
to get to grips with the car

279
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,000
that they hope
will be taking them to race victories

280
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,360
and potentially world championship glory.

281
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
<i>Decent lap there
from Carlos Sainz.</i>

282
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,280
<i>That McLaren's not looking too bad
at the moment.</i>

283
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm always excited
to go into a new racing season.

284
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,360
There's so many unknowns.

285
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,400
We have such a great history in the sport.

286
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,480
When I joined, uh,
the team was very much, uh, struggling.

287
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,920
But we finished fourth last year
and, uh, we'd like to close the gap.

288
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
We've got, uh, two outstanding drivers.

289
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,120
One very young and, uh,
pretty new to the sport in Lando Norris.

290
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,320
You know, Lando could be
one of the future stars of Formula 1.

291
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,320
Normally, when I do warm-ups,
I get too tired before I get in the car.

292
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,880
I do nothing
and then my warm-up's on the out lap.

293
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
It's what an out lap's for.
A warm-up lap to warm me up.

294
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,320
Four...

295
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,680
I don't think this is, uh,
as action-packed as Carlos' warm-up.

296
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,400
- It's more chilled, you know?
- Cool. Anything else you want?

297
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,320
No. A lie-down.

298
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,480
This is Lando's second season
in Formula 1.

299
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,520
Zak wants McLaren to be a new version

300
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,280
of this incredibly successful team
that we all know.

301
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,040
There's a lot of faith
being put in a guy who's still so young.

302
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,480
<i>Okay, Lando. Drive straight out.</i>

303
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,440
Yeah, confirm.

304
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,360
Expectations will be higher
on Lando this year.

305
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,360
For himself, from the team, from the fans,
'cause he's, he's not a rookie<i>.</i>

306
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,840
<i>Lando Norris,
in an F1 car for the first time in 2020.</i>

307
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
<i>Wait for it.</i>

308
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,840
<i>Okay, Lando. Give it everything.</i>

309
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,760
Yeah, confirm.

310
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,280
<i>Scenario seven. Scenario seven.</i>

311
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,360
<i>Looking really fast.
Really pushing that car to its limits.</i>

312
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,840
<i>Coming through the final corner
to complete the lap.</i>

313
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,600
<i>Lando Norris. A 1:24.981.</i>

314
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,080
<i>He's gone fastest.</i>

315
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,040
<i>OK, Lando, fastest lap.</i>

316
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
<i>Well done.</i>

317
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,400
Awesome job, boys.

318
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,320
I like to stay in the shadow, and,

319
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,600
when it's time,

320
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,360
jump out and shine.

321
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,400
I'm looking forward to getting
behind the wheel for the first time.

322
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,440
With Racing Point,

323
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,280
the car that left the garage on day one,
in terms of its color scheme,

324
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,880
looked very similar to the one
that was released to the press.

325
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,040
But the car itself

326
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,320
had undergone some dramatic changes.

327
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
It was

328
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,760
quite familiar
to everyone in the pit lane.

329
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,080
Radio check, loud and clear?

330
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,120
<i>Track is clear.</i>

331
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,640
When the Racing Point
came out of the garage,

332
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,840
I think everybody's jaws dropped.

333
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,240
It was, shall we say,

334
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,360
very inspired by last year's
championship-winning Mercedes.

335
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,520
I think a lot of people
in the paddock thought,

336
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,400
"Hang on. What's going on here?"

337
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,520
<i>You're good to go. Go, one.</i>

338
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,400
Go!

339
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
<i>Stroll now. Here we go.</i>

340
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,400
That fucking Racing Point
is quick.

341
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,760
Yeah, there's something a bit weird.

342
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,600
<i>OK, Lance.
Keep pushing. Keep pushing.</i>

343
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,400
<i>He's gone fastest in Sector 1.</i>

344
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,640
<i>He's the fastest in Sector 2.</i>

345
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,680
<i>They look phenomenal.</i>

346
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,240
<i>It looks like it's going to be the fastest
lap of the day, and of the test.</i>

347
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,680
<i>- Fastest car on track..</i>
- Nice one, guys.

348
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,680
<i>It's mind-blowing.</i>

349
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,520
It's worth remembering
that there are the rules.

350
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,520
You have to design and build your own car.

351
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,600
Now, the closer that car is
to one that's gone before,

352
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,080
especially if it's one
that absolutely dominated

353
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,640
the previous season's world championship,

354
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,400
the more people are going to ask questions
as to whether that's entirely fair.

355
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,640
And, most of all, whether it's legal.

356
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
You may not have been looking
at the numbers. We were.

357
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,960
But being around the same pace as Ferrari
can't be bad.

358
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,080
No. But, uh, yeah, it's early days, so...

359
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,960
We'll see. We'll see.

360
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,616
How is it, every time we ask
you or Sergio about the pace of the car,

361
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,560
you can't wipe the grin off your face?

362
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,880
Sun is shining. We're in Barcelona.

363
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,040
Could be worse. Life's good.

364
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,920
Reckon they've leapfrogged you?

365
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,680
Difficult to say.
I don't wanna comment too much.

366
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,680
I mean,
it looks like a Mercedes, that's for sure.

367
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,480
I don't know how... what the idea
and the process is behind it.

368
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,120
It's almost a,
uh, an identical replica.

369
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,720
I think the question,
the bigger question is, is it allowed?

370
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,760
I think it's, it's a bit surprising

371
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,120
they weren't maybe
a little bit more discreet.

372
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,320
Is it something
that has been designed by your team?

373
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,600
Is it something that's been copied?

374
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,800
I think it's very easy to agree

375
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,720
that we need to put a light on this story.

376
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,440
So there is no reason to delay.

377
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,000
What we've done over the winter
is, uh, is completely legal,

378
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,280
and we took inspiration
from the fastest car on the grid,

379
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,680
but it's no different
than what other teams do.

380
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,600
For sure, there will be
quite heated discussions going on,

381
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,120
because, if it was copied,
that's, in my opinion,

382
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
not legal.

383
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,160
Formula 1,
it is a political nightmare,

384
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,400
and everyone does have their own agendas.

385
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,840
Thankfully,
I leave that to Otmar to get on with,

386
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,360
and distance myself from it
as much as I can.

387
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,040
And, uh... I'll leave it at that.

388
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,040
<i>This will be a very interesting season.</i>

389
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,240
<i>Let's see how this all plays out
in the first race.</i>

390
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,440
<i>Finally, everybody, it's here!</i>

391
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,840
Welcome to Australia.

392
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,720
<i>Round 1 of the 2020 season.</i>

393
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,560
<i>Other sporting events
may have been canceled by coronavirus,</i>

394
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,280
<i>but Formula 1 bosses insist
that this race is going ahead.</i>

395
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,640
The Netflix crew.

396
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,560
It's still too early in the season
to abuse you guys.

397
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,480
Give it, like, another week.

398
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,160
I think Australia
is always super exciting.

399
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,960
- Hello, Lando. Good luck.
- Thanks very much.

400
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,160
It comes with a high degree of pressure.
You get a lot of anxiety.

401
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,840
Coming out of winter testing,
you can't underestimate the competition.

402
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
First race.

403
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,120
I gotta go this way.

404
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,440
It's a great spectacle, Melbourne.

405
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,640
There's a bit of sour grapes
about this year's car.

406
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,120
If they saw what they saw,
but we weren't quick,

407
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,600
you think anybody would've complained?

408
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,280
Probably not.

409
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,200
And in the meantime, uh,
we gotta get prepared for a race.

410
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,560
Straight down the middle. Lovely.

411
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,440
Clack, clack, clack, clack.

412
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,840
- It says, "Kills coronavirus?"
- It kills coronavirus?

413
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,800
- Why don't we just gel our whole body?
- I know.

414
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,600
The key stuff
is gonna be coronavirus.

415
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,720
Uh, I know the team's working,
uh, very hard every day

416
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,040
to put the right measures in place.

417
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,240
Starting with a full-on face gas mask.

418
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,560
- Mm.
- You get zipped up.

419
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Focus.

420
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,080
Ladies.

421
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,120
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

422
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,680
- Are you?
- Yeah.

423
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,840
We all look so depressed to be racing.
Have you seen?

424
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,040
- For him, he looks quite happy.
- Yeah.

425
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,800
This corner is notorious
for dipping your wheel off.

426
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
What are your general thoughts?

427
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,240
- Gonna struggle into turn one.
- Yeah?

428
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,880
I can't remember that last year.

429
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,120
- I remember talking about one and three.
- Yeah.

430
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,640
Australia was my first track
last year in Formula 1.

431
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,320
It was my most nerve-racking race
in my life.

432
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm gonna be, like, here, on the grass.

433
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,520
Did you see the onboard of Verstappen?

434
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,480
- Yeah.
- He is literally here.

435
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,120
Yeah. I'm gonna be more than that.

436
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,560
I would love to say a podium
as a target to have.

437
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,280
Turn 11.

438
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,800
This is genuinely one of the ones
I couldn't think of much to say about.

439
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,040
- Flat.
- Send it.

440
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,320
There's always a possibility
something can happen.

441
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,320
So the latest rumor we heard,

442
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,720
there are three or four
people in the paddock

443
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,280
with suspected coronavirus.

444
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,720
- Really? Whoa!
- Suspected.

445
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,680
Shit! Fuck. We're gonna be,
like, put under quarantine.

446
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,720
But I guess the thing is
if those people actually have it,

447
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,200
then the whole paddock will have it.

448
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,680
<i>The opening race
of the Formula 1 season in Melbourne</i>

449
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,160
<i>still looks as though
it's going to go ahead,</i>

450
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,800
<i>despite two members of the McLaren team
having shown some coronavirus symptoms.</i>

451
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,440
Could you sign that for me, please?

452
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,720
Sorry, they don't let me
touch any pen that is not mine.

453
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,160
I don't know what can happen.

454
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,320
You just gotta smile and wave.

455
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,240
Man, I think this paddock's gonna
just, like, implode from coronavirus.

456
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,200
One of our mechanics had symptoms.

457
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,760
He described what he was feeling
and, uh, that doesn't sound good.

458
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,600
Now, we're getting tested.
We're very nervous.

459
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,560
I think people are scared.

460
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,120
This situation, this is about the health
and safety of your entire racing team,

461
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,600
the other racing teams,
the fans, the officials.

462
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,680
We have no idea what's gonna happen
in the... in the future.

463
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,640
What if they ask, "Do you think it's right
that we're racing this weekend?"

464
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,080
I'd say, um,
"Absolutely, it's a risk."

465
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,480
"But at the same time,
if we take the right precautions,

466
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,960
I see no problem with it."

467
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,160
And, ultimately, it's a matter for...

468
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,080
Formula 1 and the FIA.

469
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Yeah.

470
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,000
Microphone. It's been cleaned.

471
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,200
Is it right
that a member of your McLaren setup

472
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,680
had to be isolated because of coronavirus?

473
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,720
The fact that he's isolated
doesn't mean he has coronavirus.

474
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,480
Only time will tell.

475
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,720
If one of your guys
went down with this virus,

476
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,680
would you still race?

477
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,320
I think I'd still race.

478
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
Uh...

479
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,200
But... Yeah. I would still race.

480
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,720
Um...

481
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,560
And are you worried in any way about this?
About the virus?

482
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,360
Um, I mean,
I'm worried if I get it, of course.

483
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,440
- Stay well, Lando.
- Sorry?

484
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Stay well.

485
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,720
- You too.
- Thank you.

486
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,360
What's that?

487
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,736
- The US have closed their border.
- Have they?

488
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,200
The NBA season's done.

489
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,920
- No way!
- Whole season.

490
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,720
- Yeah.
- When did they do this?

491
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,080
All of a sudden,
everybody's hearing whispers about,

492
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,720
"Oh, someone's being tested."

493
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,920
There's a lot of different opinion.

494
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,600
I think it comes down to a 50-50 split
of those who are in favor of continuing

495
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,640
and those
who just want everything to stop.

496
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,360
Welcome to our first
drivers' press conference of 2020

497
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,000
ahead of the season-opening
Australian Grand Prix on Sunday.

498
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,920
Let's open this up to the floor now.

499
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,400
Alex Kalinauckas, <i>Autosport</i>.
A question for Lewis.

500
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,720
Um, regarding the coronavirus situation,

501
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,760
are you comfortable
having traveled all the way to Australia

502
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,880
and are you satisfied with what Formula 1
and the FIA have done so far?

503
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,160
Um, I am really
very, very surprised that we're here.

504
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,200
For me, it's shocking
that we're all sitting in this room.

505
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Um, so many fans here already today.

506
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,880
Um, yeah,
Formula 1 continues to go on, and, um...

507
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,520
So, no, to your answer.

508
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,560
If we could
take our next question, please.

509
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,760
Lewis, you've been outspoken, where others
maybe have not dared to be, about corona.

510
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,400
What do you think is the reason
why this race is still going on?

511
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
Why are we still here?

512
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,280
- Cash is king?
- Cash is king.

513
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,920
Uh, I... Honestly, I don't know.

514
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,040
I can't really add much more to it.

515
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,160
<i>Strong words from Lewis Hamilton.</i>

516
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,120
<i>Lewis Hamilton made
his feelings pretty clear, cash is king.</i>

517
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,360
<i>Not impressed
that the race, at the moment,</i>

518
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,600
<i>is still going ahead.</i>

519
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,400
Anyway, nobody has an official statement,
so we're waiting.

520
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,600
Like everything

521
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,800
with this coronavirus scare
around the world,

522
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,200
information is coming at rapid pace

523
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,920
and it's changing,
quite literally, every minute.

524
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,040
That's what the...

525
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,960
They said four Haas people
have gone into the hospital.

526
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,520
The moment that one gets coronavirus,
this is killed.

527
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,840
Gone. Boom. Out.

528
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,160
<i>In the last few minutes,
it's emerged</i>...

529
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,080
...<i>that a McLaren team member
has tested positive for coronavirus.</i>

530
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,520
Got a phone call from,
uh, our team manager

531
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,560
to say that we'd had a positive case.

532
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,440
Suddenly, this situation has blown up,
with a McLaren mechanic testing positive.

533
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,360
Our position is we should race.

534
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,000
Keep testing,
and if the situation develops further,

535
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,440
um, you know, review it in 24 hours.

536
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,080
I definitely don't want us to go ahead.
I don't think we should.

537
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,000
We, uh, really looked forward
to racing in Melbourne.

538
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,720
And, from a team perspective,
we still wanna race.

539
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,000
<i>There's another development
from Melbourne.</i>

540
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,200
<i>Authorities have confirmed that...</i>

541
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,480
Thank you very much
for your patience.

542
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,400
For us, it was an easy decision.

543
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,960
Ultimately, we are out.

544
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,320
It has just landed.
A joint statement

545
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,760
between the FIA, Formula 1
and the Australian Grand Prix Corporation

546
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
that this Grand Prix has been canceled.

547
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,040
- It will not take place.
- Uh, unbelievable.

548
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:08,040
The Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix
has been canceled.

549
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,960
<i>This weekend's
Australian Grand Prix has been canceled.</i>

550
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,920
<i>- The Australian Grand Prix...</i>
- I want my money back!

551
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,200
We'd appreciate it

552
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,040
if you would make an orderly exit
towards the tram stations.

553
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,120
Thank you.

554
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,520
Disgusting.
It's disgusting for everybody here.

555
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,920
- Cash is king! Cash is king!
- Why aren't we allowed in there?

556
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,720
Can you summarize,

557
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,040
in a few sentences,
what happened the last 24 hours?

558
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,640
Uh, it's obviously frustrating.

559
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:44,120
When we arrived in Australia,
the intention was to go racing.

560
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,640
The important thing now is

561
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,920
to make sure that we get
all members of staff home safely.

562
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,360
Not to Bahrain?

563
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,640
No. I think it's fairly inevitable,

564
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,960
if we're not racing here,
we won't be racing in Bahrain.

565
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,000
Thank you, guys.
Thank you. Thanks. Thanks.

566
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,920
Formula 1
without races doesn't exist.

567
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,280
At the end of the day, we're dealing
with people's livelihoods, their jobs.

568
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,680
Their way of earning a living.

569
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,880
<i>Plenty of question marks
now remain over the season.</i>

570
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,176
<i>Seems like it will be
a huge, long-term issue.</i>

571
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,080
<i>Everything is in uncharted territory.</i>

572
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,560
I don't know
if our sponsors are gonna stay around.

573
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,320
I don't know if fans
are gonna be able to attend events.

574
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,000
Uh, I don't know if Grand Prix
are gonna be able to be put on,

575
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,560
which gives us the revenue
to build race cars.

576
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,040
<i>Lights out and away we go!</i>

577
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,840
Australia's gone, China's gone,
Vietnam's gone, Bahrain's gone.

578
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,800
Smaller teams,
uh, will be... will be struggling.

579
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,240
So there is indeed a genuine risk
for the sport and for Formula 1.

580
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,840
We could potentially lose
a number of teams here.

581
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,000
As an independent team,
are we actually going to survive this?

582
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,680
What happens from here?

583
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,200
I'm sorry, you will have to wait.
You're way too hot.

584
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,640
That's just the way I am.

585
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,320
We were finally able
to have a Grand Prix.

586
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,040
The stakes have never been higher.

587
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,760
I look forward to seeing Toto.

588
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,040
Hopefully give him a harder time
this year.

589
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,640
Fuck, again!

590
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,840
The big story remains Racing Point.

591
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,256
We're not fighting
a level playing field.

592
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,280
They're dragging our name through the mud.
I will not accept this.

593
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
The car is so hard to drive.

594
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,360
Fuck!
