1
00:00:00,593 --> 00:00:02,761
(Barry) My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,763 --> 00:00:05,513
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,381
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,199
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:15,510
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,995
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,095
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,097 --> 00:00:24,465
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,851
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:29,403
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:31,572
Barry, what you're seeing
is the Speed Force...

12
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,074
Your past, your present, your future.

13
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,544
Say, Iris, you look amazing.

14
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:37,745
Thanks, Tony.

15
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:40,548
His skin changed. It turned to metal.

16
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,751
Tony might have been a bully,
but he didn't deserve to die.

17
00:00:43,753 --> 00:00:46,303
Barry, you've always had
someone to come home to.

18
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:49,340
I can't help but wonder... Maybe
we were meant to be together.

19
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:50,558
You lost your powers?

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,376
I gave them up to save Wally.

21
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:56,096
I can re-create the circumstances
to get you your speed back.

22
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,182
Let's set up the particle accelerator.

23
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:02,770
[screaming]

24
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:07,408
Barry... he's gone.

25
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,442
[sparks popping]

26
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,194
This wasn't su...

27
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:11,695
I didn't...

28
00:01:11,982 --> 00:01:14,165
I'm so sorry.

29
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:16,534
We lost him.

30
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:17,952
No, no, no, no, he...

31
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:19,787
He could've got knocked somewhere

32
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,505
or maybe even run there.

33
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:24,508
[melancholy music]

34
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,126
Nothing on the GPS.

35
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:27,711
There were strikes
all over the building.

36
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,463
Jesse, come down here, please.

37
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,598
[sparks popping]

38
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:34,635
Jesse?

39
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,687
Wally?

40
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,640
[tense music]

41
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,394
Oh, God, Wally!

42
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:45,229
No, no!

43
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,947
Wally! Wally, wake up!

44
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:48,220
- No!
- Can you hear me?

45
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:49,817
- Wally!
- Jesse, Jesse!

46
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,285
- Jesse!
- Wally!

47
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:52,653
Jesse!

48
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:53,904
[grunts]

49
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,540
Stop yelling, please.

50
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:57,825
Her heart stopped.

51
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,410
Her heart stopped!

52
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:03,297
Jesse...

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,674
Are you okay?

54
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:08,836
Jesse!

55
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:11,505
- [gasps]
- Oh...

56
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,508
[panting]

57
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,169
It's beating. Her heart's beating.

58
00:02:16,204 --> 00:02:17,228
[sighs]

59
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,230
Henry's a doctor. He should see her.

60
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:22,433
I'm so glad you're okay.

61
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:24,602
Hey, what's with him?

62
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,904
It's Barry.

63
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:29,273
Barry's gone.

64
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,774
Are you good, Wally?

65
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,693
Okay, we should get you
home, get some rest, okay?

66
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:36,530
- I don't understand.
- No, it's okay. Let's go.

67
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,916
Jesse.

68
00:02:40,036 --> 00:02:43,420
Henry, Wells' daughter is upstairs.

69
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,039
The energy hit her too.

70
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,291
[melancholy music]

71
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,510
Her heart stopped beating.

72
00:02:49,512 --> 00:02:51,929
Henry!

73
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:53,347
All right.

74
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,473
[whirring]

75
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:05,693

[whirring]

77
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:13,784
I saw him!

78
00:03:13,786 --> 00:03:15,619
I saw Barry.

79
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:17,533
He's alive.

[foreboding music]

84
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,731
Joe?

85
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,150
Good to see you, Barry.

86
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,405
But I'm not Joe.

87
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:44,045
- You're not?
- No.

88
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:48,128
And all of this?

89
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:53,333
It's not real?

90
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,768
How do you feel, being back here?

91
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,212
I feel awful.

92
00:05:02,728 --> 00:05:06,013
We thought you'd be more comfortable

93
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,399
talking to someone who looked familiar

94
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:10,184
and in a place you knew.

95
00:05:11,026 --> 00:05:12,986
"We"?

96
00:05:12,988 --> 00:05:15,823
Who's "we," exactly?

97
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:18,242
That's a little hard to explain.

98
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,122
Sit, Barry.

99
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,700
Sit.

100
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,796
How much do you know
about the Speed Force?

101
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:42,382
It's the source of my power.
It's what makes me a speedster.

102
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,218
Yes...

103
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,220
and no.

104
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:48,555
When the first subatomic particle

105
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,808
sprang forth from the Big Bang

106
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,278
to form reality as you know it,

107
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,946
we were there.

108
00:05:55,948 --> 00:06:00,317
When the last proton
decays, stops vibrating,

109
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,571
and plunges the
universe into heat death,

110
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,074
we'll be there too.

111
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:10,210
I'm talking to the Speed Force?

112
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:17,634
Isn't that like saying I'm having a
conversation with gravity or light or...

113
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,227
You need a minute.

114
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:30,097
It's okay if you do.

115
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,266
It's a lot to take in.

116
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,652
So you're saying I'm... I'm
talking to the source of my power,

117
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:39,656
which just so happens to look like...

118
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:43,026
my adoptive dad?

119
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,445
That's trippy. [laughing]

120
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,365
We pretty much invented trippy here.

121
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,368
Look, I'm... I'm not sure
why you brought me here,

122
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,119
but you need to send me back.

123
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:55,455
My friends are in danger from Zoom.

124
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,792
[whooshing]

125
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:00,511
Did you see that?

126
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:03,096
[dramatic music]

127
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:05,933
You're not going back.

128
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:07,267
Not until...

129
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,384
Till what?

130
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:18,362
Until you catch that.

131
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:38,498
Cisco says Barry's still alive.

132
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,300
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

133
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,886
Harry, I vibed him in
the center of a storm.

134
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:45,265
It was, like, in, like,
a vortex or something.

135
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,475
He's in...

136
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:50,310
He's in the Speed Force.

137
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:51,845
- Get him out, damn it.
- I...

138
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,875
- You can get him out, can't you?
- I don't know if I can.

139
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,266
Henry, come here.

140
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:06,076
Listen, you are the only
one that can help Jesse.

141
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:08,278
Let me sit on Wells

142
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,697
till he figures out what
the hell he did to Barry.

143
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,328
I think we can get him back.

144
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:15,035
Joe, I know you love Barry, okay?

145
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:19,039
But you have Iris, and you have Wally.

146
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,258
Barry's all I have left.

147
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,043
I promise.

148
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,629
We'll find him.

149
00:08:32,354 --> 00:08:34,972
Thank God you're here.

150
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:38,558
Caitlin's usually the
one doing this, but...

151
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,227
Heart rate's normal.

152
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,396
Reflexes and breathing are fine.

153
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:44,114
She should be waking up.

154
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,733
She's just not.

155
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,869
It was the same with Barry.

156
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:51,371
Um, after the first accident,

157
00:08:51,373 --> 00:08:53,793
he was in a coma that
no one could explain.

158
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:55,075
What did you do with him?

159
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:57,628
So they brought him here...
Well, Wells brought him here.

160
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,912
The other Wells.

161
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:01,381
Right, the Wells who
was actually Thawne.

162
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,749
- Eobard, not Eddie.
- Right.

163
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,334
It's... it's complicated.

164
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,803
Anyway, we took care
of Barry while Wells...

165
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:09,089
Thawne... treated him.

166
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,841
Are there any records of that treatment?

167
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:13,143
We might find clues how to help Jesse.

168
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,929
Uh, yeah, they'd be
downstairs in the storage room,

169
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,264
in the morgue.

170
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,182
Ew, you guys have a morgue?

171
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,101
Well, it's not like a morgue morgue.

172
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,658
It's not... it's like a poor
man's morgue, really. Morgue-ish.

173
00:09:24,693 --> 00:09:26,695
Would one of you go get them, please?

174
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,526
Okay, well, I'm not going alone.

175
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,528
[sighs]

176
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,308
Thank you.

177
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,534
Okay, so it's a morgue morgue.

178
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,705
But, you know, we had to keep
the dead meta-humans somewhere.

179
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:45,625
Yeah, looks like you did a
lot more than just store them.

180
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,296
Fake Wells might've done a few
dissections for study purposes.

181
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,432
And this didn't tip any of you
off that he might be secretly evil?

182
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:53,884
It was a crazy time, okay?

183
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,635
We had a lot going on.

184
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,137
I'll tell you what...

185
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,139
It's a good thing
Thawne was so organized.

186
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,058
[thud, clatter]

187
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,310
Would you stop knocking stuff over?

188
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,278
You stop. I didn't touch anything.

189
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,863
Okay, whatever you say.

190
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:10,067
Okay, this is it. This
is Barry's ex-file.

191
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,318
[crash]

192
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,654
[snarling]

193
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,657
[suspenseful music]

194
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,326
A zombie?

195
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,961
For real?

196
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,592
[exciting music]

197
00:10:26,594 --> 00:10:29,812
[screaming]

198
00:10:30,765 --> 00:10:32,064
Tony?

199
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:33,516
Nope, not Tony... Not anymore.

200
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:35,735
- Get behind me.
- You get behind me.

201
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:40,856
[screaming]

202
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,358
Tony!

203
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,076
[moaning]

204
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:46,779
[grunting]

205
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:54,837
[screaming]

206
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:56,088
[glass shatters]

207
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,176
- Ooh!
- Oh.

208
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:02,052
- Didn't see that one coming.
- No.

209
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:05,131
Zombie Girder. [chuckles] This...

210
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:06,382
[glass shattering]

211
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,115
[panting]

212
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:31,240
Iris.

213
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:32,992
We're glad you made it, Barry.

214
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,244
[sighs]

215
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,546
Not Iris.

216
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:38,914
It's just you again.

217
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,384
[dramatic music]

218
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:45,087
Sit, Barry. Sit.

219
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,839
You're always on your feet.

220
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,682
You remember this place,

221
00:11:56,918 --> 00:11:58,684
where we first kissed?

222
00:11:59,194 --> 00:12:01,821
Yeah, of course, except that wasn't you.

223
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:08,373
We thought you'd find this place
and our appearance less upsetting.

224
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,332
Yet you seem upset.

225
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:16,919
My friends, my city...

226
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:19,955
my whole world is in danger.

227
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:22,925
Zoom is on a rampage with the
power that he stole from me,

228
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:24,627
and you are keeping me here.

229
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:27,930
You were given a rare and precious gift,

230
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:29,849
and you rejected it.

231
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,884
No, I did not reject it.

232
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:34,553
I gave up my powers to
save someone's life...

233
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:35,888
To be a hero.

234
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,524
I nearly killed myself
trying to get them back,

235
00:12:38,526 --> 00:12:41,795
when you brought me
here, wherever here is.

236
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:45,481
- That's not what we meant.
- Okay.

237
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:48,234
If you would rather
have given these powers

238
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:49,869
to somebody else,

239
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:52,037
why did you give them to me?

240
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,541
Because you're The Flash, Barry.

241
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,796
[sighs] We got a new problem.

242
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:03,666
Our accelerator experiment
seems to have reanimated

243
00:13:03,668 --> 00:13:05,584
one of the dead metas in our morgue.

244
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:07,920
"Reanimated," like brought back to life?

245
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:09,672
Life-ish. You ever
seen "The Walking Dead"?

246
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:10,923
It's "The Walking Dead,"

247
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:14,343
but without higher brain function
and with major rage issues.

248
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:15,978
Still unsure if our brains
are on the menu, though.

249
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,847
- Which one?
- Tony Woodward.

250
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:21,350
The bully from school who
turned into the metal man?

251
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,018
That's not good, Cisco.

252
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,020
History repeats itself.

253
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:27,273
First as tragedy

254
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:29,358
and then as farce.

255
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,328
[tense music]

256
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,197
Wells, as a parent, believe me,

257
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,917
I have nothing but sympathy
for what you're going through.

258
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,202
Listen to me closely when I say to you,

259
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:42,454
we got a lot of fires
burning at the same time,

260
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,873
and if we all work together,

261
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,709
we just might be able to put them out.

262
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:49,211
Let Henry take care of your daughter.

263
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:51,380
Me and Iris will handle
this Girder situation,

264
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:53,766
but you and Cisco are the scientists.

265
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,551
You're the only one
who can bring Barry back

266
00:13:55,553 --> 00:13:57,493
from wherever the hell he is right now.

267
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:00,606
Ramon...

268
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:02,141
give those medical records to Henry,

269
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:05,194
and meet me in the Breach
Room in five minutes.

270
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:08,447
We've got work to do.

271
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,566
Now we just need to find Tony.

272
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:13,202
Yeah, hopefully before he kills someone.

273
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:14,486
Come on.

274
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:21,327
[ominous music]

275
00:14:29,754 --> 00:14:32,304
Big Belly Burger in
Starling City is way better.

276
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,756
This place sucks.

277
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:35,090
[car alarm beeps]

278
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:37,142
[snarling]

279
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,265
Oh, my God. Is that your car?

280
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:44,423
Oh, yeah.

281
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,687
[glass breaking]

282
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:51,774
[car alarm blaring]

283
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:54,443
That's my mom's car!

284
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:59,615
So how do we know this is safe?

285
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:01,116
Well, define "safe."

286
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:03,516
Safe, as in my brain's not gonna melt.

287
00:15:03,551 --> 00:15:06,672
No. It's a simple feedback
loop, Ramon, all right?

288
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:09,842
When you vibe on Barry, your brain
waves send me the necessary data

289
00:15:09,844 --> 00:15:11,460
to pinpoint whatever dimensional pocket

290
00:15:11,462 --> 00:15:13,629
or corner of the universe
that Barry is stuck in.

291
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:17,099
And then we electrically stimulate

292
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:19,468
your prefrontal cortex
while opening a breach,

293
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,270
which gives you physical access to Barry

294
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:24,640
and lets you be the
beacon to guide him home.

295
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:26,892
Simple feedback loop.

296
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,812
I'm sorry. Did you say
electrically stimulate?

297
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:33,282
Ramon, do you want to
bring Barry back or not?

298
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,818
[dramatic music]

299
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,071
[sighing] Okay.

300
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:42,207
[sighs]

301
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,711
[whirring]

302
00:15:45,713 --> 00:15:48,714
[electricity humming]

303
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,666
And we have a lock.

304
00:15:53,754 --> 00:15:55,504
I don't understand.

305
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:59,591
If I'm The Flash, then why
are you doing this to me?

306
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:01,977
Why do I have to catch
this... this thing

307
00:16:01,979 --> 00:16:03,846
before you let me go back?

308
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:06,265
Please, look, I will
do whatever you want.

309
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:09,601
Just let me go back right
now, so I can help my friends.

310
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,356
Barry!

311
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:17,576
[electricity humming]

312
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,163
Barry, turn around!

313
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,199
<i>Barry!</i>

314
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:26,085
[rumbling]

315
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,629
What is that?

316
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:30,370
What is that?

317
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:35,761
Those are your friends.

318
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:37,783
They want you to come back.

319
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,266
Can I?

320
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,886
Of course.

321
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:45,797
But if you do,

322
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,962
it'll be without your powers.

323
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:55,447
Take my hand!

324
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:00,152
Do it. Take my hand.

325
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:01,370
[whoosh]

326
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,387
The choice is yours, Barry.

327
00:17:20,808 --> 00:17:24,176
Barry!

328
00:17:34,655 --> 00:17:37,156
[groans]

329
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:38,657
What is going on in here?

330
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,275
Just hang on a little longer, Ramon...

331
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:41,660
A little longer.

332
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,996
Hey, you're killing him!

333
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,202
Cisco!

334
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:52,704
Hey, Cisco, can you hear me?

335
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:54,088
[sighs]

336
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,468
I saw him.

337
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,843
Barry... he turned to me.

338
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,795
[sighs]

339
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:01,046
I'm sorry.

340
00:18:01,794 --> 00:18:03,015
I lost him.

341
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:05,968
[melancholy music]

342
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:09,388
No.

343
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,759
[computer beeping]

344
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,945
Whoa, Cisco's meta-human
alert app is going crazy.

345
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:23,483
Oh, Tony just trashed
the hell out of Jitters.

346
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:25,735
[scoffs] Now, that is strange.

347
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,104
He knocks over a hydrant
on 4th and Stevenson,

348
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,823
doesn't go in the building,

349
00:18:29,825 --> 00:18:32,325
then smashes a Humvee in
front of the Big Belly Burger,

350
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,910
but doesn't go in the building.

351
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,945
Gets to CC Jitters...
He actually goes in.

352
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:39,749
Yeah, it's like Jitters
was his target, but why?

353
00:18:40,602 --> 00:18:43,370
When I was in Iron
Heights awaiting trial,

354
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,623
I had a cellmate who always
swore he was gonna break out.

355
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,792
At a pre-trial hearing,
he stole a deputy's gun

356
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,677
and escaped in a police cruiser.

357
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,462
There's a point to this, Joe, I promise.

358
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,681
Now, the poor, dumb bastard
could have gone anywhere, right?

359
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:58,051
But he was apprehended two
hours later. Do you know why?

360
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,104
'Cause he went to his old
girlfriend's house looking for her.

361
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,555
So you think that's what Tony's doing,

362
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,140
even in the state he's in now?

363
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,975
I think people are creatures of habit,

364
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,645
sometimes at a level stronger
than conscious thought.

365
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,313
No, I don't think that
Tony had a girlfriend.

366
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,033
I mean, not the way that he
was hitting on me when he...

367
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,319
He came into Jitters.

368
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,905
He's after me again.

369
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,075
So, when he was after
you the first time,

370
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,662
where'd you see him next, after Jitters?

371
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,664
Home.

372
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,332
He came to our house when he took you.

373
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,834
Wally's there now.

374
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,335
No, no, Dad, this is good.

375
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,337
We know where he is, and
we know what he wants.

376
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,172
That means we know how to beat him.

377
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,841
How do you propose we do that?

378
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,977
We use me as bait to lure
him back to S.T.A.R. Labs,

379
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,847
where Cisco and Wells can kill him...

380
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,566
again.

381
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:49,853
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

382
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,189
[panting]

383
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:08,672
Who are you pretending to be now?

384
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,926
I don't have time for this.

385
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:14,928
Yes, you do, Barry.

386
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,431
You have all the time in the universe...

387
00:20:18,946 --> 00:20:20,928
- literally.
- No, I don't.

388
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:24,437
And how can you stand there in judgment
and accuse me of rejecting my gift?

389
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:28,074
Do you have any idea how much I've done
since I was first struck by lightning,

390
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:31,328
how many people I've helped with
the power that you gave me...

391
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,747
what I've sacrificed?

392
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:36,032
Of course we do.

393
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,368
You've saved countless lives.

394
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,870
[dramatic music]

395
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,039
And now you're the only thing

396
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:48,246
standing in between your
world and unspeakable evil.

397
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,431
And yet, for all of that,

398
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:54,351
you've never been here.

399
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,301
_

400
00:21:06,982 --> 00:21:09,566
I can't believe he's coming here.

401
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:12,736
Wally. Thank you.

402
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,738
Don't mention it.

403
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,491
Wait.

404
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:21,578
I've been meaning to ask you. Uh...

405
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,463
How are you feeling?

406
00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:25,915
Tired, but fine, I guess.

407
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:30,420
So you don't notice anything different?

408
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,473
Uh, no.

409
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:37,260
I mean, I want you to know you can come
and talk to me if you're scared or...

410
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:42,515
you have questions about
how your body's changing.

411
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,517
Oh.

412
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,654
I think you're a little late
for the puberty talk, Dad.

413
00:21:47,656 --> 00:21:49,155
I've seen the Internet.

414
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,940
[chuckles]

415
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:54,694
Looks like I'm gonna have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

416
00:21:59,868 --> 00:22:01,284
Are you okay?

417
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,836
[distant clatter]

418
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:04,371
[sirens wailing]

419
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:05,955
[Tony screaming]

420
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:07,841
Wally, go upstairs.

421
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,377
Please, go upstairs, now.

422
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:13,930
Dad, do you really think
that he's a meta-human?

423
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,765
Well, he got zapped by
the particle accelerator,

424
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,384
and he was unconscious.
It was worth a shot.

425
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,352
I gave you that mug.

426
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:20,520
He's coming.

427
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:23,523
[snarling]

428
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,809
[ominous music]

429
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,527
- You sure about this?
- You know what?

430
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,562
Two minutes ago, I would've
said yes, absolutely.

431
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,481
But now...

432
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,233
what the hell?

433
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,402
[door closes]

434
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:38,822
[snarling]

435
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:39,906
[whistling]

436
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:42,208
Tony! Hey!

437
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,628
Come on, over here.

438
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:53,136
[grunting]

439
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,542
You getting towards S.T.A.R. Labs?

440
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,679
- On my way.
- I'll meet you there.

441
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,978
Wally, stay here! I'll be right back!

442
00:23:05,434 --> 00:23:08,568
Why did you bring me here?

443
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,187
Your mother's death
happened to you, Barry.

444
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:14,240
It made who you are,
but have you accepted it,

445
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:17,777
really accepted losing her?

446
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:22,365
Maybe that's why you
couldn't come here...

447
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,585
'cause that would make it real.

448
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:28,371
I know it's real.

449
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,624
Every day I know it.

450
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:34,544
I had a chance to save her.

451
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,630
You saw what I chose.

452
00:23:37,632 --> 00:23:40,633
And you're at peace with that decision?

453
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:42,802
[scoffs]

454
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:44,103
"At peace""

455
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:46,856
[solemn music]

456
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,525
How could someone ever be at peace

457
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,727
with letting his mother die...

458
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:57,784
Deciding that his life was
more valuable than hers?

459
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:10,463
Do you really think your mother
would've wanted you to die for her?

460
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:14,217
And out of all the
people the Flash saved

461
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,469
as a result of that decision,

462
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:18,269
what about them?

463
00:24:20,308 --> 00:24:22,642
Do their lives have value too?

464
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:26,646
[whooshing]

465
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:31,768
I don't have to listen to this.

466
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,270
I have to get home.

467
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:45,658
[dramatic music]

468
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,793
Cisco!

469
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:48,294
Is that zombie still behind you?

470
00:24:48,296 --> 00:24:51,915
Good news is we lured
Tony back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

471
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,667
Bad news is we lured Tony
back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

472
00:24:54,669 --> 00:24:56,569
No, no. This is good. Okay, sidenote...

473
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:58,421
You both might want to be
on this side of the room,

474
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:01,174
especially if you're wearing any jewelry
or you have any metal plates in your body.

475
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:02,558
- Huh?
- Excuse me?

476
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,394
The stray energy from the accelerator

477
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:06,596
reactivated Girder's brain...
Well, parts of it, anyway.

478
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:09,849
So I disassembled our MRI
machine to set up these...

479
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:12,548
Electromagnets. So, when
Girder walks through that door

480
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,604
and gets caught in the
field that they generate,

481
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:17,440
it should disrupt the energy
wave that turned him Abby Normal.

482
00:25:17,442 --> 00:25:18,858
Like wiping a hard drive.

483
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,610
Lah-kah-tah!

484
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:23,463
[grunting]

485
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:26,466
Okay, now, I can only maintain
full power for a few seconds,

486
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:29,335
so I can't actually turn this
on until he's in the room.

487
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:31,588
[growling]

488
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,673
[intense music]

489
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,642
There he is. Hi!

490
00:25:35,644 --> 00:25:40,346
[electricity humming]

491
00:25:42,517 --> 00:25:44,100

[panting]

493
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:48,605
Why don't it look like it's working?

494
00:25:48,607 --> 00:25:51,024
Because it's not. Uh,
let's get out of here.

495
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:59,182
This is the safest
place for her for now.

496
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:01,351
[distant clatter]

497
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:02,519
Not safe enough.

498
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,688
Plans A through G did not work.

499
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,909
Do we have anything in
here that can stop him?

500
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:11,828
Barry could stop him if
we could bring him back.

501
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,307
We tried that already, Dr. Allen.

502
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:15,126
We need to try it again.

503
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,757
Somebody needs to try something.
That door's not gonna hold.

504
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:29,212
[whoosh]

00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:32,098

[chuckles]

507
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:58,041
Mom.

508
00:26:58,043 --> 00:26:59,793
Hi, Barry.

509
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,051
You're not my mother.

510
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,256
Why are you doing this to me?

511
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:17,510
We're not doing anything
to you, sweetheart.

512
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,396
You're just so tired.

513
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,149
Sit, Barry. Sit.

514
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,114
You were right all along.

515
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,166
I haven't accepted it...

516
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:43,119
not for a second.

517
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,789
I don't think I ever will.

518
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,295
My beautiful boy...

519
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:56,683
You have to find a way.

520
00:27:56,685 --> 00:27:58,268
How?

521
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,886
I don't know.

522
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,222
But I know this.

523
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:06,142
What you've become... It's wonderful...

524
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,894
a miracle even,

525
00:28:07,896 --> 00:28:12,482
but it won't make bad
things stop happening to you.

526
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:14,651
Even the Flash can't
outrun the tragedies

527
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:17,654
the universe is gonna
keep sending your way.

528
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,989
You have to accept that.

529
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:22,789
And then you can truly run free.

530
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:27,547
[voice breaking] I know.

531
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:29,632
I just miss her.

532
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:34,587
I miss you so much.

533
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:39,509
What if I told you
that she's proud of you?

534
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,513
And of the man that you've become?

535
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:46,316
Who's telling me that...

536
00:28:46,318 --> 00:28:49,519
the Speed Force or my mother?

537
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,271
Both.

538
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:12,484
Is there any other way out of here?

539
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:14,820
No, the Breach Room was
designed to be sealed off.

540
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:17,489
All right, look, if
it's me that he wants,

541
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:19,324
- I'll just lead him away.
- No, you won't.

542
00:29:19,326 --> 00:29:20,876
You'll never even
make it past that door.

543
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:22,494
If he came back from the
dead and still wants you,

544
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:24,246
what makes you think
he's gonna let you go now?

545
00:29:24,248 --> 00:29:25,831
Wait.

546
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:30,402
I saw Barry. He had this look.

547
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,037
What if we couldn't get
him out of the Speed Force

548
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,539
because he didn't want to come back?

549
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:35,991
Do you remember this book?

550
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:38,644
It was always your favorite.

551
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:42,965
"Once there was a little
dinosaur called a Maiasaur,

552
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,316
"who lived with his mother.

553
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:46,301
"One day, he told his mother,

554
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:49,254
"'I wish I were special
like the other dinosaurs.

555
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:53,425
If I were a T. rex, I could
chomp with my ferocious teeth!"

556
00:29:53,427 --> 00:29:56,762
"'But if you were a T.
rex, ' said his mother,

557
00:29:56,764 --> 00:29:59,431
'how would you hug me with
your tiny little arms?'"

558
00:29:59,433 --> 00:30:02,934
[chuckles]

559
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:06,938
"'I wish I were an Apatosaurus,
' said the little dinosaur,

560
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,159
"'so with my long neck I could
see high above the treetops.'

561
00:30:11,161 --> 00:30:14,946
"'But if you were an
Apatosaurus, ' said his mother,

562
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:16,698
"'how would you hear me in the treetops

563
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,285
"'when I told you I love you?

564
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:24,039
"What makes you so
special, little Maiasaur?'

565
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,841
"said his mother.

566
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:31,296
"'Is it your ferocious teeth
or long neck or pointy beak?

567
00:30:31,298 --> 00:30:34,182
"'What makes you special is out of all

568
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:38,603
"'of the different dinosaurs
in the big, wide world,

00:30:38,605 --> 00:30:43,225
"'you have the mother
who is just right for you

570
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:44,726
and who will always'"...

571
00:30:44,728 --> 00:30:47,646
both: "'Love you.'"

572
00:30:49,366 --> 00:30:51,650
You're ready.

573
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:05,831
[whoosh]

574
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:08,750
[dramatic music]

575
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:23,065
[triumphant music]

576
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,985
Turn it on.

577
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:28,854
We got to try again.

578
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:30,188
Any of you got a better idea?

579
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,240
When you look into the Speed Force,

580
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:34,526
can someone else see into it too?

581
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:36,611
Well, as long as you're
in physical contact

582
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:39,915
with Ramon while he's vibing, then...

583
00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,533
yes.

584
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:43,001
Let me do that.

585
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:45,253
I can get Barry to come back.

586
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:47,672
No.

587
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:49,124
Let me do it.

588
00:31:49,126 --> 00:31:50,876
Please.

589
00:31:57,968 --> 00:32:00,719
Iris...

590
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:07,142
[dramatic music]

591
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,708
[gasps]

592
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:32,717
Barry.

593
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:43,929
Barry, come home to me.

594
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:53,271
Run, Barry. Run.

595
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,114
Barry!

596
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:33,465
Barry!

597
00:33:34,198 --> 00:33:36,364
Ha ha!

598
00:33:38,202 --> 00:33:41,486
I'm so glad you're back,
'cause we're about to die.

599
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:42,571
Wait. What?

600
00:33:42,573 --> 00:33:43,822
[banging on door]

601
00:33:43,824 --> 00:33:45,707
- So...
- Girder.

602
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:48,241
Girder came back to life, and
he's all Young Frankenstein now,

603
00:33:48,262 --> 00:33:50,662
and he only recognizes Iris,
and she lured him to my workshop

604
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,998
so we could demagnetize him,
but the machine shorted out,

605
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,382
so he's about to come through that door

606
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:56,496
and smush us all into chunky salsa
and possibly eat our brains out.

607
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:58,405
- I don't know. Jury's still out on that.
- All right, I got it.

608
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,835
I-I will lure him to your workshop,

609
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,814
and we figure out a way to
turn the power back on, okay?

610
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:05,176
Both: Plan H. [banging on door]

611
00:34:05,178 --> 00:34:07,262
[grunts, screams]

612
00:34:07,264 --> 00:34:10,181
[ominous music]

613
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,947
Hey, Tony!

614
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,999
He's taking him the long way. Come on!

615
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,424
I hope you're ready. He's almost here.

616
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:38,543
Nope, not ready.

617
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:40,045
Power needs at least
two electromagnets...

618
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:41,713
Too much for this wiring to handle.

619
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:43,798
We're gonna need a
really big extension cord!

620
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,551
All right, I'll...
I'll see what I can do.

621
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:05,370
Ugh!

622
00:35:05,372 --> 00:35:06,788
Barry!

623
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:14,045
[grunts] Tony, Tony...

624
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,798
look, you were never my favorite person,

625
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,500
but let's end this...

626
00:35:18,502 --> 00:35:20,969
so you can finally rest.

627
00:35:22,472 --> 00:35:25,390
[heroic music]

628
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:34,649
He's using spin to charge the magnets.

629
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:37,152
Like an electric turbine.

630
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:40,605
[electricity crackling]

631
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:43,942
[yelling]

632
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:53,418
[panting]

633
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,287
Sorry... I got lost.

634
00:35:56,289 --> 00:36:00,125
It's okay. We found you.

635
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:01,793
[chuckles]

636
00:36:05,405 --> 00:36:09,123
[somber music]

637
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:12,426
[clears throat] Barry.

638
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:15,129
You should rest. You
don't need to be here.

639
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,299
No, that's just it. I think I do.

640
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,807
[electricity crackles]

641
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:33,898
Hi.

642
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,817
[dramatic music]

643
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,874
How did I get here?

644
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,748
[chuckles]

645
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,337
How did you do that?

646
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,256
Are you, like, magic now?

647
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:02,259
Did you know that was gonna happen?

648
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,846
Maybe. It's hard to explain. It's...

649
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,182
It's the Speed Force.

650
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,487
[air hissing intermittently]

651
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:19,777
It's been quite a day, huh?

652
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,246
Not so much "one damn
thing after another"

653
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:25,184
as "every damn thing all at once".

654
00:37:25,752 --> 00:37:27,451
It all worked out okay in the end.

655
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:31,455
No, you worked it out okay in the end.

656
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:34,959
It's funny. I never really understood

657
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,378
where you were coming from
with your whole "fate"

658
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,548
and "everything happens
for a reason" point of view.

659
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,800
But now...

660
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:46,270
I think that maybe I was wrong.

661
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:50,808
Everything that's happened to us...

662
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,027
Good and bad...

663
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:55,479
It made us who we are.

664
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,758
And I don't think that I would
change it even if I could.

665
00:38:01,204 --> 00:38:02,820
Does that make any sense?

666
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,872
Perfect sense.

667
00:38:06,876 --> 00:38:08,659
And since we're on the subject

668
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:12,997
of changing our minds
about important things,

669
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,376
you know that part where I told
you I was gonna leave Central City

670
00:38:15,411 --> 00:38:19,013
so that you could be the Flash without
being concerned about me all the time?

671
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:23,424
Forget all of that.
You're stuck with me.

672
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,176
I'm not going anywhere.

673
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,011
[chuckles]

674
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,577
Joe offered to take me so many times.

675
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:46,697
I always found an excuse to say no.

676
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:49,617
[melancholy music]

677
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,090
My mom and I read
this when I was little.

678
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,593
Do you know it?

679
00:38:59,595 --> 00:39:03,597
Yeah. I-I never really liked that book.

680
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,182
Why?

681
00:39:05,184 --> 00:39:07,384
Because it was about a
mother who was always there

682
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,969
for her child, no matter what,

683
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,606
and that wasn't my mom...

684
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:14,808
or yours.

685
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:19,813
We never had anyone who
was "just right" for us.

686
00:39:25,371 --> 00:39:27,738
Didn't we?

687
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,409
I'm seeing things a lot differently now.

688
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:35,079
I wasted so much time being angry

689
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,299
about what I'd lost,
when I had so much...

690
00:39:38,301 --> 00:39:43,337
My dad, Joe, and you.

691
00:39:44,524 --> 00:39:47,591
The truth is, Iris, I
don't know what this is

692
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,594
between us or where we go from here.

693
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,647
All I know is you're everything to me,

694
00:39:53,649 --> 00:39:56,066
and you always have been.

695
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:59,653
And the sound of your voice
will always bring me home.

696
00:39:59,655 --> 00:40:02,573
[upbeat music]

697
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,449
[ominous music]

698
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,667
Cait, please.

699
00:40:13,669 --> 00:40:16,036
I asked you not to call me that.

700
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,504
Caitlin...

701
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:20,791
we've been through this again and
again, and we've gotten nowhere.

702
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,128
Now, I need to know... Are you
with me, or are you against me?

703
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,298
Don't answer that yet.

704
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,135
I'm gonna go out there,

705
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,270
spend a moment speaking to my friends,

706
00:40:33,272 --> 00:40:35,773
and when I come back,
you'll give me your answer.

707
00:40:35,775 --> 00:40:39,310
If you're still here, I'll know
you've chosen to stay with me.

708
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:42,646
But if you're not here...

709
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,317
I'll know you've chosen
your friends instead.

710
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,820
And I will show you
exactly as much mercy

711
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:54,825
as I will show them when
we next see each other.

712
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,378
So there you have it.

713
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,547
[sighs]

714
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,470
I need to go.

715
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:19,683
[demonic voice] My
brothers and sisters...

716
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,853
my friends...

717
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:26,190
I've brought us to this new world

718
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,525
which lay before us,

719
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:33,364
