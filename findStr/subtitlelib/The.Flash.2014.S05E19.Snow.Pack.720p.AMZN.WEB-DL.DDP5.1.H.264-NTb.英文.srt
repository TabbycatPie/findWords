17
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,040
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.

18
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,510
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

19
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,180
But secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

20
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,040
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

21
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:16,370
But when my daughter came back from the future to help,

22
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,910
she changed the present.

23
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,410
And now our world is more dangerous than ever.

24
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,070
And I'm the only one fast enough to save it.

25
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,450
I am the Flash.

26
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,910
Previously on "The Flash"...

27
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,840
- Is my dad even really-- - Caitlin, your father is dead.

28
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,380
- Dad? - You found me.

29
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,830
I want to make it up to you, Caity.

30
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,310
I really should've been there for you.

31
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,940
Icicle wouldn't have gone to all this trouble

32
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,420
to kill my dad if there wasn't a piece of him still left.

33
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,430
We got Dwyer, we gave him the cure,

34
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,070
but another Cicada showed up.

35
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,390
She wants to tell you her secret.

36
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,910
Someone instructed you to do it.

37
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,350
Eobard Thawne.

38
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,740
Dad, please don't do this!

39
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,080
Nora, if you try to run back in time again,

40
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,790
I will feel it in the Speed Force.

41
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:58,910
Good-bye, Nora.

42
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,370
You took our daughter back to the future?

43
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,350
I didn't have any other choice.

44
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,950
I? It's we, Barry.

45
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,510
We. She's our daughter,

46
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,770
- not just yours. - I know that.

47
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,920
But you left her there anyway?

48
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,840
I can't trust her, Iris!

49
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,390
That puts all of us in danger!

50
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,280
That's how you feel, Barry.

51
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,180
What about asking how I feel?

52
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,740
I didn't think I had to!

53
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,260
Of course you didn't.

54
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,290
Of course you didn't, Barry!

55
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,140
You always see one way through a problem

56
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,320
and damn what I think.

57
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,030
Wait, wait, what the hell does that mean?

58
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,030
You know, we have been through so much crap,

59
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,500
we have been through so much therapy

60
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,870
and you are still--

61
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,030
still making decisions based on your emotions!

62
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,970
'Cause I'm right this time!

63
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,210
Flashpoint?

64
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,130
Going to the Speed Force and leaving me?

65
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,680
Were you right those times too?

66
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,640
You think I wanted to do this?

67
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,300
That this was easy?

68
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,390
Seeing Nora looking at me, asking for forgiveness

69
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,530
knowing it might be the last time I ever see her?

70
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,180
What about the last time that I get to see her, Barry?

71
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,430
I didn't even get a chance to say good-bye!

72
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:15,020
Damn it, Iris, she lied to us for months!

73
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,830
And she explained why!

74
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,020
That she was working with Thawne?

75
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,800
That doesn't bother you.

76
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,880
No, it doesn't.

77
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,310
Maybe if he killed your mother in front of you,

78
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,890
you'd feel differently.

79
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,760
Maybe you feeling differently, Barry,

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,040
is why we should have made this decision together.

81
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,770
She just wanted to meet you, Barry.

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,270
The father that she never knew

83
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,640
and there was one person who could teach her how to do that.

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,050
Is it really so hard to understand

85
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,440
why she would go to him?

86
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,810
Doesn't matter if I understand it.

87
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,560
Thawne is manipulating her.

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,070
He's on death row, Barry. How is he manipulating her?

89
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,070
You know, if this were anybody else, you'd back me.

90
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,100
But because it's Nora, because it's our daughter,

91
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,930
the person who finally stopped hating you,

92
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,600
you refuse to see how dangerous this is.

93
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,190
I mean, you talk about making decisions based on emotion.

94
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,740
Look in the mirror.

95
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,490
All those years without my father

96
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,890
and you gave me a second chance.

97
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,700
And now I've lost him all over again.

98
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,330
I failed you, Little Runner.

99
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,960
No, this is my fault.

100
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,230
I should've never lied to them about working with you.

101
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,670
Well, perhaps not.

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,330
I screwed everything up.

103
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,120
And now I can't even help them catch Cicada

104
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,060
because my dad will know if I run into the Speed Force.

105
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,040
He most certainly will.

106
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,850
Wait.

107
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,490
You've run into the Speed Force hundreds of times.

108
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,150
And my father, other speedsters,

109
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,720
they never felt you coming.

110
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,600
How did you do that?

111
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
Thawne, tell me how you did it.

112
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,470
- Nora. - Tell me. Thawne!

113
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,710
It's not for you.

114
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,210
I need to see my father.

115
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,460
Please, if there is a way

116
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,700
I can go back in time to see him undetected,

117
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,540
you have to tell me how.

118
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,590
I used to idolize your father.

119
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,190
I wanted to be just like him.

120
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,110
But that was not my fate. I was to be the reverse.

121
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,980
Opposite of him...

122
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,040
in every way.

123
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,640
So instead of tapping into the Speed Force

124
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,790
to access my powers...

125
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,590
I created my own.

126
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,920
You created your own Speed Force?

127
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,290
Yes, I did.

128
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,400
And I can access it to go back in time?

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,120
That and more.

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
Can you teach me how to use it?

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,540
Well, I-- I have to warn you, Nora.

132
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,860
It's a little bit negative.

135
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,430
Hey, where is Cecile and Cisco?

136
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,960
Cecile's relieving the nanny.

137
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,590
And Cisco went to talk to Breacher

138
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,050
about how to track Cicada II.

139
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,100
Okay.

140
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,210
Where's Iris?

141
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,860
Uh, I honestly don't know.

142
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,280
We're not really seeing eye to eye right now.

143
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,250
Because?

144
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,460
Because I took Nora home for good.

145
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,160
- Nora's gone? - Just like that?

146
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,710
Well, only thing to do, really,

147
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,600
because Nora can't be trusted.

148
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,900
I can deduce from your faces that you're upset,

149
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,530
but you understand the truth need to be exposed.

150
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,840
Yes, we understand that.

151
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,450
What you don't understand is that this is a family.

152
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,410
You didn't include anyone in this.

153
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,530
Oh, look. Baby Giraffe--

154
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,840
Sherloque, you've done enough.

155
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,060
- All right? - Oh, I have not done enough.

156
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,360
We still have another Cicada to catch.

157
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,130
Man, he says you've done enough.

158
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,160
Well, perhaps I have.

159
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,670
I got to take this. Yeah?

160
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,640
Look since Cisco didn't take me with him,

161
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,820
I'm gonna round up the Cicada II files.

162
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,280
Cecile and I are going to go over them tomorrow,

163
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,780
see if anything makes my nose wiggle.

164
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,010
Are you gonna be okay?

165
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,710
I honestly don't know.

166
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,590
Guys, this is CCPD. We've got a big problem.

167
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,100
The nurses heard a crash in the middle of the night

168
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,290
but nobody saw anything.

169
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,840
By the time they got here,

170
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,100
Grace was gone.

171
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,420
Judging by the thermal warping in this glass,

172
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,060
an energy blast with a lot of heat took out the window.

173
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,650
But I don't really think we need any clues

174
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,050
to know who took her.

175
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,590
Future Grace steals past Grace.

176
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,350
I don't even know if there's a police code

177
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,120
for kidnapping yourself.

178
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,750
Hey, what's it say?

179
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,840
Grace's coma is stable.

180
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,080
As long as future Grace is looking after younger Grace,

181
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,580
her life's not in any danger.

182
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,970
We still have no way to find either of them.

183
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,260
Could things get any worse?

185
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,360
Working late, Dr. Tannhauser?

186
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,030
Or working early, depending how you see it.

187
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,720
Well, I stopped by to say good night.

188
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,770
So I guess I'll say good morning.

189
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,540
Good morning, J.P.

190
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,640
Get back! Hold it right there!

191
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,460
Thomas?

192
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,390
I don't suppose Icicle left any frozen fingerprints behind?

193
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,110
No, but this docking station

194
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,000
is lined with a carbon-filled Kapton polymide.

195
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,110
NASA uses it to build probes

196
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,080
meant for the coldest reaches of space.

197
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,830
There's a lot of fresh puddles in here.

198
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,890
You think he stole whatever kept this place cold?

199
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,610
- Try way beyond cold. - Why would he want it?

200
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,780
You're going to have to ask Carla

201
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,190
when she's done filing the theft report

202
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,880
or Caitlyn when she gets here.

203
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,570
I'm not sure about much lately.

204
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,630
Hey, Barr.

205
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,700
Have you talked to Iris since she left?

206
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,620
I'm just giving her some space.

207
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,840
All right, just make sure you don't give her too much.

208
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,750
The right choice? What the hell are you talking about?

209
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,920
You lied to me for 20 years and told me my father was dead.

210
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,670
How the hell is that the right choice?

211
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,390
Your father is trapped inside an ice monster, Caitlyn.

212
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,390
What was I supposed to do?

213
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,290
Split custody with him on the weekends?

214
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,340
I don't know. You could try telling me the truth.

215
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,510
But why tell your daughter anything?

216
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,170
Funny, I don't recall you telling me

217
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,920
that you let the monster out of the prison.

218
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,110
Because you never told me he was in a prison!

219
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,390
And now all these years that I could've been working on

220
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,230
a cure for dad are gone!

221
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,870
We may never get him back.

222
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,910
Well, at least you have someone to blame.

223
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,820
Moms are always here for that.

224
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,190
Are you okay?

225
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,720
I will be as soon as we find Icicle.

226
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,410
My mom told me what he stole.

227
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,630
It's a prototype Cryo-Atomizer.

228
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,900
- And what can he do with that? - Nothing good.

229
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,390
My contacts upstate got nothing.

230
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,350
I even tried Kritschgau at the DOD. Nada.

231
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,670
Nobody can spare the manpower to help find Cicada 2.0.

232
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,870
Hey, what about The Citizen?

233
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:35,900
Any fresh leads on Cicada? Iris?

234
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,340
Hello? Um, Earth to Iris?

235
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,160
Ralph, wait!

236
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,780
"Barry, I don't know if I can ever forgive you for this."

237
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,250
I think you missed a comma there.

238
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,810
Can you stay out of it for once?

239
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,640
She's not kidding. Super mad.

240
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,740
No. Look, um, Iris,

241
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,610
I know how Barry can be.

242
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,010
But you guys are like the Meghan and Harry of superhero royalty.

243
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,960
Your love is eternal.

244
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,180
- You two will talk and-- and-- - We did talk.

245
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,670
I want Nora to stay here, he doesn't.

246
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,480
How do we solve that?

247
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,480
Okay, Iris, honey.

248
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,260
I haven't always been in the near-perfect relationship

249
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,700
that I'm in now.

250
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,980
So take it from someone with experience,

251
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,410
the only way you two solve this problem is together.

252
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,600
And you're not going to find your answers here.

253
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,350
Yeah, you're right.

254
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,370
- You need to go after her. - Oh, come on.

255
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,630
Give me a break. Have you seen her right hook?

256
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,540
Ralph, she's hurt, I know.

257
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,180
But there's something more. I feel it.

258
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,530
She's determined.

259
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,900
Reprogramming complete.

260
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,030
The Time Sphere's navigation core is now locked

261
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,270
onto Nora West-Allen's temporal signature.

262
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,070
And you disabled the tracker that Cisco installed

263
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,570
- into the Sphere? - Yes.

264
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,760
However, there are still alarms in S.T.A.R. Labs.

265
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,940
If you wish to use the Sphere undetected,

266
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,920
you must activate it off-site.

267
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,350
Planning a trip?

268
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,310
How did you get in here?

269
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,940
Followed you then stretched under the door.

270
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,120
By the way, was anybody ever gonna

271
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,790
tell me about this secret room?

272
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,610
What else do we got in here? A bowling alley or something?

273
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,100
Ralph, I don't have time for this.

274
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,330
Actually, it looks like you have all the time in the world.

275
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,530
You're not gonna stop me.

276
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,570
Who said anything about stopping you?

277
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm in position.

278
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,110
Thawne, I said I'm ready.

279
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,890
We shall see if you're ready.

280
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,830
Now run.

281
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,780
Now listen to me, Nora.

282
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,270
Breathe. Breathe.

283
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,100
You're reaching out and nobody's there.

284
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,550
The loneliness is pain.

285
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,430
Pain racing through your mind.

286
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,870
Crushing you, wrecking you,

287
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,920
shattering your soul into a million little pieces.

288
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,700
And suddenly, you are no longer you.

289
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,130
You're part of something different now.

290
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,690
Part of a negative force.

291
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,710
It didn't work.

292
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,660
Thawne, why didn't it work?

293
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,160
- Are you ready? - All set to hit

294
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,050
88 miles an hour!

295
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,940
Here we go.

296
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,150
Open the time breach!

297
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,680
Ralph, hurry up!

298
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,450
So the Cryo-Atomizer has the ability

299
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,040
to disperse particles into the atmosphere.

300
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,250
Particles that slow down atoms to a grinding halt.

301
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,480
- And the slower they get- - The colder they get.

302
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,340
- How cold are we talking? - Absolute zero.

303
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,160
And if we combine them with Icicle's meta-powers...

304
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,710
He could plunge Central City into a new Ice Age.

305
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,130
There is some good news.

306
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,520
I think we can track the nano-cryoparticles

307
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,850
inside the atomizer.

308
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,820
We just have to reprogram an oscillating inversion scanner.

309
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,330
Do you mind running to the downstairs storage area

310
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,070
and grabbing it?

311
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,460
Wait. You should use a modified field array.

312
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,020
There's one in the upstairs archives.

313
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,660
No, no, actually the inversion scanner

314
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,250
would work best. Thank you.

315
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,590
No, no. Not since we upgraded our field arrays last year.

316
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,280
You know you would know that if you visited more,

317
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,600
not just when you needed something.

318
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,370
Apparently, only when I need the wrong thing.

319
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,580
- The inversion scanner. - The field array.

320
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,350
I'll get both.

321
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,150
Might take my time.

322
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,970
You need help?

323
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,360
No.

324
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,320
Is it me or is it getting really cold in here?

325
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,820
Run!

326
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,850
Two for one.

327
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,030
So who wants a family reunion?

328
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,970
Adieu, Team Flash.

330
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,610
Barry. Barry, come on!

331
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,600
Come on, Barr!

332
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,360
I can barely feel his pulse.

333
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,720
He has hypothermia. His heart rate's dropping.

334
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,560
We only have seconds to save him.

335
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,190
- What are you doing? - Well, this--

336
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,080
this machine has a large power source

337
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,770
I need to access to save Monsieur Allen.

338
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,850
Watch out.

339
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,800
That'll work. Stand back.

340
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,620
All right.

341
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,580
This current should heat up the copper wiring

342
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,870
of his suit's circuitry and we need to heat it up enough

343
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,650
so that his speed healing kicks in.

344
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,610
- Is this safe? - Safer than dying.

345
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,320
- Come on, Monsieur Allen. - Barry?

346
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,240
- Come on! - Barr!

347
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,630
Icicle. He has them.

348
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,780
- No, no, no, no, Monsieur. - No, no, wait. No, wait.

349
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,060
In time. In time. First, you rest.

350
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,440
Then we bring them home together.

351
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,850
Where are we?

352
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,550
In another decommissioned Tannhauser site.

353
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,290
This site is a little more off-the-grid than usual.

354
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,820
It's where we kept our most classified projects.

355
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,440
Great. I guess we are Icicle's next project.

356
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,350
We need to get out of here.

357
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,880
Well, there's a circuit panel over here.

358
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,770
I think we can hack it and open the door.

359
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,920
Neither one of us knows about electrical engineering.

360
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,370
Our best bet is to break me out of these meta-cuffs

361
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,700
and let Killer Frost do the rest.

362
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,640
Don't be foolish. You'll never break those.

363
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,880
Well, it's no more foolish than you electrocuting yourself,

364
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,040
but if you want to, knock yourself out.

365
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,700
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

366
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,480
How did we get here?

367
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,910
I mean, you're my mother and I'm your daughter.

368
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,220
But it has never felt like that.

369
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,580
You've always been cold, distant.

370
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,790
You never wanted to be a part of my life.

371
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,890
Not then, and certainly not now.

372
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,350
Why?

373
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,360
I mean, what did I ever do to get treated like this?

374
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,850
- What? - Why did you leave me?

375
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,970
You left me first.

376
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,250
You went to school across the country to get away from me.

377
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,080
You took a job in Central City

378
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,880
instead of working in the the same zip code as my lab, Caitlin,

379
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,280
you were married to a man I never even met.

380
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,370
I got the hint,

381
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,170
but don't you dare mistake things.

382
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,540
I didn't leave first.

383
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,330
What are we doing here? What do you want with us?

384
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,560
I want what you could be.

385
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,100
- Stop it! - Just a small blood sample.

386
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,080
See you soon, Snow Pack.

387
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,610
- What? - Snow Pack.

388
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,310
That was your father's nickname for our family.

389
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,360
I remember, and why is that scaring you?

390
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,500
He said he wanted what we could be

391
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,330
and then he took a sample of your blood.

392
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,180
Theoretically, he could use the Cryo-Atomizer

393
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,610
to recreate the process that created Killer Frost.

394
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,160
So if he did that to you...

395
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,650
I would gain an ice persona.

396
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,160
And now with a sample of my blood...

397
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,000
He can create a serum

398
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,150
that will permanently suppress our human sides.

399
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,870
He wants an ice family

400
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,390
and he's willing to erase us to get it.

401
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,570
- Hold my suit. - Oh, my God, Ralph.

402
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,900
Do you ever wash this thing? - Focus, okay?

403
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,040
You sure you're ready to talk to "He who shall not be named"?

404
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,530
Well, whether I am or not, Gideon said

405
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,610
that these were Nora's last known coordinates.

406
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,080
You're up.

407
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,910
Hey, bro.

408
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,380
Uh, what a day. Am I right?

409
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,900
You mind if I get a quick word there with Hannibal Speedster?

410
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,190
It's just going to take, like, a second.

411
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,330
Is that right?

412
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,190
Well, unless you got a signed Shift Change Order,

413
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,780
nobody goes in there but me, bro.

414
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,230
Only you, huh?

415
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,720
Okay, if you insist.

416
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,540
Oh, shrap.

417
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,430
You need to hurry.

418
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,210
This guy's such a dick,

419
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,030
I got to think super douchey thoughts just to keep this face on.

420
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,630
Douchey, douchey, douchey.

421
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,070
I did everything exactly like you told me.

422
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,590
How come I can't do this?

423
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,680
Listen, not harboring enough rage to fuel your trip

424
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,000
is not something to be ashamed of.

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,110
You're just like your father.

426
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,370
Your light is your greatest strength.

427
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,210
- Nora. - Mom?

428
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,350
Step away from him, please.

429
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,400
Mom, it's okay.

430
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,330
Eobard is helping me.

431
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,370
He has a way for me to get back home.

432
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,550
Nora, step away from him now.

433
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,270
Nora, listen to your mother.

434
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,960
Where's Dad?

435
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,730
It's just me.

436
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,850
It's probably for the best. Come on, we have to hurry.

437
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,440
What do you mean it's probably for the best?

438
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,670
Nora, the last thing your father needs

439
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,510
is to see you here with him.

440
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,350
She's right about that.

441
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,850
No.

442
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,450
No, she's not, and neither is my dad.

443
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,100
Nora, your dad was wrong,

444
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,860
but he still cares about you.

445
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,670
Why are you here and he isn't?

446
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,290
Look, I understand how you feel--

447
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,370
Do you?

448
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,830
Do you know what it's like to want something

449
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,630
more than anything else in your whole life?

450
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,380
To know your father?

451
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,090
To do your best to follow in his footsteps?

452
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,660
To make him proud?

453
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,880
How could he leave me?

454
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,600
- Wait, wait! That's enough! - Nora.

455
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,260
How could he stop loving me?

456
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,280
No!

457
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,570
It's always the same condescending

458
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:31,880
"I know better than you" Crap.

459
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,100
and you never change!

460
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,440
She's trying to kill me.

461
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,270
- Who else knows? - Everyone.

462
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,690
It's time for you to go home.

463
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,730
Good-bye, Nora.

464
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,820
Goodbye, Nora. Goodbye, Nora.

465
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,780
She's gone.

466
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,280
What the hell do you mean she's gone? Gone where?

467
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,360
I don't know where. I only know when.

468
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,090
2019.

469
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,070
When Nora said you showed her a way back...

470
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,700
she meant your way.

471
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,290
Yes. And I made a mistake.

472
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,000
She wanted to go home, I tried to help her.

473
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,100
But listen, Iris, you have to find her.

474
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,840
She needs her family.

475
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,870
And that family does not include you.

476
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,320
But it does include Barry.

477
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,090
She needs you both united.

478
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,580
I'm only going to say this once.

479
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,750
You don't get to comment on us.

480
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,240
You stay the hell out of our business

481
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,170
or you won't even make it to the end of that timer.

482
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,630
I like your anger,

483
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,500
but don't let it drive Barry away.

484
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,440
The only way for you to help Nora

485
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,090
is by doing it as a family.

486
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,790
Otherwise, you're simply leaving Barry

487
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,620
the exact same way he left Nora.

488
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,840
Iris, we got to bail.

489
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,170
They found Officer Jackass.

490
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,460
Think about it.

491
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,650
Iris, please.

492
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,330
What's it like having another person in your head?

493
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,270
Pretty crazy.

494
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,850
I mean, when she first showed up,

495
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,100
I couldn't wait to get rid of her,

496
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,450
but when she disappeared,

497
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,060
I tried even harder to get her back.

498
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,790
What finally brought her back?

499
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,250
Family.

500
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,140
She protected us.

501
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,090
Well, I'm glad you had someone there for you.

502
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:45,000
Hey, Mom, that was pretty clever what you did.

503
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,210
Figuring out Icicle's plan.

504
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,420
Well, I recall you helped with that too.

505
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,370
It's amazing what we can do

506
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,000
when we're not trying to rip each other's heads off.

507
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,580
Stay away from her.

508
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,220
I'll come back for her later.

509
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,350
First, we have some catching up to do.

510
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,270
What?

511
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,860
No!

512
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,700
Caitlyn!

514
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,590
There's no leads.

515
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,340
There's no hits on Icicle's cryosignature,

516
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,290
no reads on facial recognition, nothing.

517
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,120
Barr, we'll find him. We always do.

518
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,280
How, Joe? How are we gonna find them?

519
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,370
Caitlyn's kidnapped.

520
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,830
We need Caitlyn to find Caitlyn.

521
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,040
Cisco's on another Earth

522
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,420
and Iris won't even answer my calls! I...

523
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,300
I don't know how to fix any of this.

524
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,550
If I might?

525
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,960
It occurs to me that hiding

526
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,190
a needle in a haystack is good.

527
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,990
Hiding a needle in a stack of needles?

528
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,720
That's better.

529
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,290
These are all the cold spots in the area.

530
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,520
You think Icicle is masking his cryo-signature

531
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,360
with someplace that's already cold?

532
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,930
Giving him the perfect cover.

533
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,350
So we just refocus our search,

534
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,900
look for temperature anomalies

535
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,450
in already existing cold spots, et voila.

536
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,060
This is great. I'll start retasking the satellites.

537
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,070
- Hey, thanks for your help. - The least I can do.

538
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,380
I've got a cold spike.

539
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,730
That's quite a stack of needles.

540
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,270
Thomas, are you in there?

541
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,940
Thomas, please.

542
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,450
Now it's time to meet your better half.

543
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,760
Perfection.

544
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,080
How did you get out?

545
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,210
Me? I just raised my hands.

546
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:14,310
You were the one who froze my cuffs

547
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,560
so they shattered like glass.

548
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,050
Clever, Caitlyn.

549
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,830
I'm almost gonna miss her when she's dead.

550
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,310
No turning back now. Time to make a choice.

551
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,780
You either save her...

552
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,370
Or fight me.

553
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,330
Save her.

554
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm gonna go get him.

555
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,860
Okay, explain again why I'm here doing this

556
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,370
and not anybody else?

557
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,400
It appears we're a bit short staffed at the moment.

558
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,270
All right, if it's just us, it's just us.

559
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,560
- Let's do this. - Let's do this thing.

560
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,380
- What's happening? - Oh, great timing.

561
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,640
Oh, yeah, good timing. Oh, you do this.

562
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,480
Okay, Icicle has Caitlyn and her mom

563
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,450
in some caves north of the Badlands.

564
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,780
Well, the Flash is already on the scene.

565
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,780
So for all we know, the problem is already solved.

566
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,350
- Guys, I have a problem. - Or not.

567
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,480
I need to phase Carla out of a cryo-chamber

568
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,170
but it's too cold. I can't even touch it.

569
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,090
All right, we need heat fast.

570
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,910
What if he generates a lightning bolt?

571
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,540
He can't throw a bolt. That would kill her.

572
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,710
Then why doesn't he just, uh, hold onto it?

573
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,540
- That could kill him! - No, no. He's right.

574
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,620
The lightning cannot hurt you if you are in phase.

575
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,350
If half my molecules are in phase,

576
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,270
the electricity would hop from stable molecule to stable molecule.

577
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,360
Creating an electronic bridge

578
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,240
that will generate the heat that you need, et viola.

579
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,700
Without electrocuting him, he can phase in,

580
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,900
grab her, and then phase out.

581
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,610
All in 3/10s of a second.

582
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:26,320
I got you.

583
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,770
I'm going to warm her up, all right?

584
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,790
What a waste.

585
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,260
I wanted to make you perfect.

586
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,290
Now I must end you.

587
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,330
Impossible.

588
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,490
Caity?

589
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,800
Dad?

590
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,680
Are you okay?

591
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,960
Is it you? Is it really you?

592
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,740
It's me.

593
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,590
- It's really me. - Oh. Oh, my God.

594
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,160
You're going to be okay. You just need to take it slow.

595
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,970
Thomas?

596
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,650
My God!

597
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,510
- Are you-- - I'm okay.

598
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,880
I took a beating but Killer Frost ice healing kicked in.

599
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,460
I'm going to be fine thanks to Dad.

600
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,450
Well, how--how is this possible?

601
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,180
Well, I saw Icicle about to kill Caitlyn,

602
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,370
and I found the strength to break through.

603
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,380
Just like Killer Frost, Dad saved me.

604
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,930
Well, you saved me too, Caity.

605
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,740
I mean, thanks to you,

606
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,660
I think I may have finally banished this monster.

607
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,670
That's good.

608
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,590
That just leaves one more monster for me to kill.

609
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,730
Run!

610
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,300
Get out of here. I'll take care of this.

611
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,550
Cool knife. I've got two.

612
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,820
Caitlyn, run!

613
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,100
Dad? Dad. Please.

614
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,080
Caitlyn.

615
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,380
Dad, I told you to go.

616
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,290
I already left once before.

617
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,830
Left both of you.

618
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,180
Worst mistake I've ever made in my entire life.

619
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,610
I wasn't going to make that again.

620
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:39,730
Family shouldn't leave family.

621
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,590
I'll always love you.

622
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,610
How's Caitlyn and her mom?

623
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,230
Caitlin's still running some tests,

624
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,380
but she thinks Carla's gonna be okay.

625
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,910
I mean, as okay as she can be given the circumstances.

626
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,400
Why was Cicada II even there tonight?

627
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,220
I mean, why attack Icicle and Caitlin?

628
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,750
Perhaps the ice meta were not the primary target.

629
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,770
What could Cicada II want with the Cryo-Atomizer?

630
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,950
Well, we're not gonna figure it out tonight.

631
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,990
So let's rest tonight.

632
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,450
Are you coming back to the house?

633
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,520
No, I'm gonna stay at the loft tonight.

634
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,010
You are?

635
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,190
Yeah.

636
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,150
We should talk.

637
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,310
Awkward a bit.

638
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,020
So you went to the future?

639
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,070
Yeah. John Stamos still handsome.

640
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,520
He'll never not age.

641
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,550
No, never. Man, he looks good.

642
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:00,900
So this endothermic litmus test

643
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,070
would've created a stoichiometric reaction.

644
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:06,370
If there was any residual meta DNA in your system, it--

645
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,340
Would've turned white. I know.

646
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,030
And it's still green, so you're clean.

647
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,270
You're not a meta.

648
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,910
Those were all the clues that I used to find dad.

649
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,130
Including some files that I may have stolen

650
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,570
from your file room.

652
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,330
Caitlin and Thomas' infamous Periodic Table.

653
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,370
Nerdonium.

654
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,620
You know, he stole that one from me.

655
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,360
Really? I thought he came up with that

656
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,610
while he was fixing the kitchen sink.

657
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,010
No, I thought of that.

658
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,690
Come to think of it, I also fixed the kitchen sink.

659
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,810
Well, I--I better be going.

660
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,050
Good night, Caity.

661
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,120
Mom? Um...

662
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,480
Do you want to maybe go get a drink?

663
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:12,490
You can tell me more about elements you invented.

664
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,580
Now or whenever.

665
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:20,910
No, actually, now would be perfect.

666
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,410
There's a little wine bar around the corner.

667
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,860
Heading home?

668
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,350
Well, it's like Barry said--and Joe--

669
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,940
- I've done enough. - They did say that.

670
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,630
But you hung around anyway.

671
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,630
Oui , I did.

672
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,340
You were there for Barry when he needed you.

673
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,970
Oui , I was.

674
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,310
And you helped saved Caitlyn's mom.

675
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,940
Yes, that's right. I did all those things.

676
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,530
I should not have done those things?

677
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,360
I'm just saying maybe you have more to do...

678
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,030
For your family.

679
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,300
I just wanted my family back together.

680
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,920
Even if that meant doing something drastic like time travel.

681
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,190
Yeah, I get that.

682
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,610
More than anyone.

683
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,900
You were right about Thawne.

684
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,740
I think he's manipulating Nora,

685
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,690
but I also believe him.

686
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,100
Nora is back here in our time.

687
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,150
I was...

688
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,660
Wrong.

689
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,580
I shouldn't have left Nora

690
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:15,370
or made that decision without you.

691
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,610
Whatever it is that we have to figure out,

692
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,490
we should've done it together.

693
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,140
Family doesn't leave family.

694
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,190
Well, I mean you weren't the only one to make that mistake.

695
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,940
I shouldn't have gone to the future without you.

696
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,310
I shouldn't have left you like that.

697
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:42,340
I mean, that was the same thing that I got so mad at you for.

698
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,670
But I know now that we can't solve this

699
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,460
if we don't stick together.

700
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,830
I can barely solve things with you,

701
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,010
so without you...

702
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,910
Are we making jokes already? Really?

703
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,990
Let's bring our kid home.

704
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,380
There's something else that I wanted to tell you.

705
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,580
Barry, the way that Thawne looks when he talks about Nora.

706
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,350
I've only ever seen that in one other person.

707
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,270
You.

708
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:26,280
What are you saying?

709
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,950
I think Thawne might actually care about Nora.

712
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,820
Soon, Grace.

713
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,820
Soon.
