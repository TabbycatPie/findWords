00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,920

[panting]

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,440
It's all about mental strength.

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,120
Pierre... his year got off
to a horrible start.

5
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,200
<i>You could just see this driver
in front of you wilting.</i>

6
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,380
[Gasly grunts]

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,136
[Christian Horner] <i>Can't keep making
excuses for him.</i>

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,276
<i>It's not good for us as a team.</i>

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,120
<i>We're just running one leg in...</i>

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,340
<i>If you can't deal with that pressure,
is it time to change?</i>

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,280
[Gasly] <i>There is unfinished business
with Red Bull.</i>

12
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,940
[interviewer] I mean,
how do you feel about it?

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,560
About the change?

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,940
[interviewer] Yeah.

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,760
Well, for sure, for me
at the beginning I was surprised

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,680
'cause, uh, it's not what they told me.

17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,420
We're in a unique position in Formula 1
where we have four cockpits.

18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,240
We've got four cockpits,
we can move the drivers around.

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,500
<i>They're all Red Bull drivers.</i>

20
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,480
<i>Toro Rosso drivers are
Red Bull contracted drivers.</i>

21
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,560
[Gasly] <i>The change, the swap,
coming back in Toro Rosso,</i>

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,800
I was disappointed, 'cause for me,
I didn't feel like that was really fair.

23
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,760
You are just, like...

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,240
You're angry.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
[photographer] Action!

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,580
[Franz Tost] <i>Was not so confident
with the Red Bull car.</i>

27
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,260
And, uh, that stand to reason
why he struggled.

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,500
Then the confidence goes down,

29
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,960
uh, you feel, as a driver, that the team
doesn't believe, anymore, so much in you.

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,120
- [in Italian] Good morning.
- Good morning.

31
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,460
[Tost in English] <i>Therefore, it was good
that he came back to us.</i>

32
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Morning!

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,640
- Morning.
- Morning.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,620
[Tost] How is everything?

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,140
[man] Very well, thank you, yourself?

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
[photographer] Action.

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,780
[Gasly] <i>My goal as a Red Bull driver
will always be</i>

38
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,260
<i>to be in the top team
in that Red Bull car.</i>

39
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,180
You know, you feel the need,
"I need to get there, I need to do it."

40
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,480
<i>Uh, we'll do what it needs
to get back there.</i>

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,960
It felt, "Okay, what have we got to lose
by switching these two drivers

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
to evaluate them to the end of the year?"

43
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,460
[tools drilling]

44
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,840
[David Croft] <i>Here comes Alex Albon now,
round the outside.</i>

45
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,600
[Martin Brundle] <i>That's bold if he's gonna
go past Ricciardo there.</i>

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,820
[Croft] <i>What a move!</i>

47
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,400
<i>The rookie, Alex Albon,
passes the McLaren!</i>

48
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
[cheering]

49
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,580
[Horner] <i>Alex is exceeding
all our expectations.</i>

50
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,220
<i>You know, we're seeing him
fighting for a podium.</i>

51
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,960
This has been a monumental step for him.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,220
You have to remember, this is
his first year in Formula 1 racing.

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,800
[Sofie Albon] You need, like, pajamas.

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,936
- [Minki Medina] Yeah.
- [Sofie] You need, like, shampoo.

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,556
- I've taken them already.
- And conditioner.

56
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,800
- Bodywash.
- I did. Done that.

57
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,700
Did you get me a shirt?

58
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,700
- [Sofie] Deodorant.
- [Minki] Put some more clothes.

59
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,756
[Alexander Albon] <i>Being an Aston Martin
Red Bull Racing driver,</i>

60
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,580
<i>it's a crazy thing to think about.</i>

61
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,300
Actually, when I think about it now,
it still doesn't feel believable.

62
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,780
Bye.

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,060
[Albon] <i>Everything's happening so fast.</i>

64
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,960
<i>I'm, like, not living
with my parents anymore.</i>

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Beautiful.

66
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,600
[chuckles] I've got no one to do
my laundry, which I'm very sad about.

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Plus, I'm moving to Monaco, so...

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,120
<i>I'm going full F1 driver spec,
living the life.</i>

69
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
<i>This is my place.</i>

70
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,940
Obviously got an amazing view.

71
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,760
This is where
I'm gonna have my single life.

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,140
[Minki] But now, we have to unpack.

73
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,080
It's a big, you know, like a big step,
moving away from home.

74
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,200
[Albon] <i>I realize that I have been
fast-tracked into a big team.</i>

75
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,340
I've done well, but there's
nothing really to say that...

76
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,560
I fully deserve the seat.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,300
<i>You know it could always be
your last opportunity.</i>

78
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,940
<i>This is your chance to show yourself.</i>

79
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,240
They want to see that sign that,
you know, they want you for next year,

80
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,720
and that's what I'm working towards.

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,200
<i>I've got to show that I belong here.</i>

[reporter 1] <i>Alex,
a very happy week for you</i>

[Albon] <i>Thank you very much.</i>

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,740
So, I've just been announced
that I'm a Red Bull driver for 2020.

90
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,140
<i>Yeah. Very cool.</i>

91
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,200
How do you find out
that you've got the Red Bull seat?

92
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,400
Does it come in an email,
in a phone call?

93
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,920
An email.

94
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,720
- A Post-it Note.
- [laughs]

95
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,220
- On your desk?
- [laughs] Yeah.

96
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,100
I'm... I'm happy. I'm very happy.

97
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,996
[reporter 2] Alex, what did you think
that you did better than Pierre Gasly

98
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,480
to have his seat?

99
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,740
[chuckles] You ask
a very tough question. Um...

100
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,720
<i>Now I've been announced,
it feels really good.</i>

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,060
<i>It feels really, really good.</i>

102
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,940
- We are running late.
- [Albon] Why?

103
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,660
- Because you're a chatterbox. That's why.
- [Albon] Let's...

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,140
Speaking for England today.

105
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,000
Always, mate, always.

106
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,620
And talking for Thailand.

107
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,860
Hello. Sorry we're late.

108
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,976
- Hi, Alex!
- Hey. How are you?

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

110
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,360
[Gasly] <i>This is so frustrating.</i>

111
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,596
<i>The fact that it's a dream
and the beginning...</i>

112
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,340
And you work so hard every day,
and people helping you,

113
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,920
your family, making big sacrifices
to give you the chance,

114
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,220
one day, maybe, to live your dream.

115
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,080
<i>When you go through these challenges,
you take, like, big hits.</i>

116
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,020
<i>Uh, need to get back up
and just prove my point.</i>

117
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,260
I'm the kind of guy that if I get knocked,

118
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,260
I just go back at it
and try to knock even harder.

119
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
[machine whirring]

120
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,660
Everything okay?

121
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,180
All good.

[Tost] <i>Every driver in Formula 1

<i>especially after the first half
of the season</i>

124
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,380
<i>when he was struggling at Red Bull Racing.</i>

125
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,120
<i>He has to prove that this was a period
where he learned a lot.</i>

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,100

<i>We've all been impressed.</i>

131
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,040
We knew he was very fast,
and I think he's proven that.

136
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,720
I was performing at a high level.

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,280
Whoo! It's really good.

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,260
A double shot.

<i>It's probably been
my strongest year in F1.</i>

146

<i>So it makes me feel proud
and happy about this season.</i>

147
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,640
Morning, Zak.

148
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,756
[Brown] Mornin', how are you?

149
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,700
[Sainz] Good, you?

150
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,316
[Brown] Other than my back's wrenched...

151
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,400
[Sainz] Your back?

152
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,816
Yeah, everyone's been telling me
to work out and lose weight.

153
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,476
I'm working out to lose weight,
I hurt my back.

154
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,940
I'm gonna be as fit as you soon.

155
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,000
- Maybe not.
- Mmm...

156
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,040
[Brown laughs]

157
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,960
This time last year,
we were one of the slowest cars,

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
and at some events, the slowest car.

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,240
<i>This year, it's been
a very successful season,</i>

160

<i>that if they continue this trend,</i>

163
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,380
they could be competing
with the likes of Red Bull,

164
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,060
possibly Ferrari and Mercedes for podiums.

165
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,940
<i>It's great to see.</i>

166
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,200
<i>They're one of the great teams

328
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,780
<i>because, of course,
you think about these things.</i>

329
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,680
Losing a friend,
that's also what makes you as a...

330
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,680
makes you as a person.

331
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,780
All these experiences
you go through, and...

332
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,040
<i>it is important for me to show
my strength, and mental strength,</i>

333
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,620
that I can go through this
and get the job done.

334
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
[all cheering]

335
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,960
[laughs]

336
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,660
[Gasly] <i>I'm super excited about next year.</i>

337
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,740
I want a podium
every weekend, but... [laughs]

338
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,800
[all shout]

339
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,480
[Horner] My mate! Mate, mate, mate!

340
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,920
Don't be too hard on yourself.

341
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,276
[man over speaker]
<i>And the Toro Rosso as well,</i>

342
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,860
<i>to see, you know...</i>

343
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,680
[Croft] <i>We're just hearing that
Lewis Hamilton could be getting a penalty</i>

344
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,400
<i>for his shunt with Alex Albon.</i>

345
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,960
Um, I massively apologize, Albon.

346
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,540
I went for a move, and...
completely my fault.

347
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,560
[Croft] <i>Which means, potentially,</i>

348
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,280
<i>Carlos Sainz could be
promoted into third place.</i>

349
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,960
[Caco] You fought from P20, mate.

350
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,440
- [Sainz] Yeah.
- [Caco] Fucking P20.

351
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,856
- [man] That's enormous.
- [Sainz] I need to know.

352
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,600
I'm, like, in the most awkward moment
of my career.

353
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,500
[man] Of course.

354
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,120
Like, I really, seriously don't have
a clue how to act right now.

355
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,420
Like... just wait.

356
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,840
We're waiting for the final justification
to come out from the FIA,

357
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,720
which will confirm P3.

358
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
But we don't know.

359
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,380
[in Spanish] And we are here waiting

360
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,900
to find out if Carlos is getting
his first podium.

361
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,100
[exhales]

362
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,456
- [man in English] I think we should.
- We'll do a team photo, for sure.

363
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,916
- Why?
- We shouldn't go on the podium.

364
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,716
[Caco] Are you telling me
we're not going on the podium?

365
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Why?

366
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,640
Because I just don't want us
to look really desperate.

367
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,336
It's not desperate.
It's a legitimate podium.

368
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,616
First podium of his career
and he's going to look desperate?

369
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,020
Are you fucking kidding me?

370
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,080
Since the day he was born he's been
waiting for this fucking moment.

371
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,140
Are you fucking kidding me, "desperate"?

372
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,740
What the hell? What is wrong with her?

373
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,000
What is wrong with her?

374
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,060
There'll be celebrations
if this happens, won't there?

375
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,296
- Is it confirmed?
- [crew member] Yeah, it's confirmed.

376
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,460
[all cheering]

377
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
[Caco] Yes!

378
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,240
[Buxton] <i>Hamilton fighting with Alex Albon
for the podium places,</i>

379
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,420
<i>and ultimately, after the race,
was given a penalty.</i>

380
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,060
<i>So, Carlos Sainz
inherited that third place.</i>

381
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,060
His debut Formula 1 podium.

382
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,200
[all cheering]

383
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,120
<i>After the race, as the lights were going
down and the circuit was being packed up,</i>

384
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,540
<i>he went to the podium.</i>

385
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,620
I think the most unique podium celebration
that anyone's ever had

386
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,180
for their first Formula 1 podium,

387
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,260
because he didn't get to share it
with the two other drivers.

388
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,040
Got to share it with his entire team.

389
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,300
Yeah!

390
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,460
[shouting indistinctly]

391
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,380
They deserve the podium, so...
almost doesn't matter how you get it.

392
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,480
Just the fact that you got
a trophy to bring home

393
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,500
to all the men and women at McLaren

394
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,280
that have been through a lot,
and are working so hard for the team.

395
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,400
It was great to bring home
a trophy for 'em.

396
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,980
<i>Mission accomplished.</i>

397
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,996
- [crew member 1] Three, two, one!
- [crew member 2] Carlos!

398
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,420
[all cheer]

399
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,640
[interviewer] How do you feel
about the season?

400
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,820
Terrible. I wanna quit.

401
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,700
I'm kidding. Please don't play that.

402
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
[crowd cheering]

403
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
This is Daniel.

404
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,360
It's not. Who would... That's childish.

405
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,460
Are you on Netflix this year?

406
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,140
I don't know. I think they ignored me
for the whole year, so...

407
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,880
- they can fuck off.
- [both laugh]

408
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,860
[Croft] <i>It's the last race of the season
and time for the annual photo call.</i>

409
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,580
[photographer] Okay, guys.
Everybody looking to this camera, please.

410
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,936
Of course I'm kind of sad
to leave the team,

411
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,636
<i>but I'm grateful for the time that we had.</i>

412
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,080
<i>Really enjoyed my ride with them
for the three years we had together.</i>

413
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,800
<i>I'll always look back
and remember those times.</i>

414
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,940
<i>Keep them in good memories.</i>

415
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,836
All right, guys.
I think everybody knows where we are.

416
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,720
We are not where
we wanted to be this year.

417
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,660
I want to take this time
to actually thank you

418
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,500
and tell you, next year will be...
It must be better.

419
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,280
<i>My confidence in the team is still high.</i>

420
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,620
And hopefully just forget about 2019.
It never happened.

421
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,976
[Kevin Magnussen] It's tough to have
a whole year, like, almost written off,

422
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,356
but I think it will...
It'll kind of benefit us in the future,

423
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,500
all the things we've learned this year.

424
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,540
I think we have not to focus
on being the fastest,

425
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,120
but learning as much as possible.

426
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,336
- And then the fast comes on its own.
- [Romain Grosjean] Look at Mercedes.

427
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,340
- What they did was very impressive.
- Yeah.

428
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,220
They were very slow.

429
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,556
Then they got better,
then they got to Melbourne

430
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,676
and they put everything together.

431
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,820
Yeah. Exactly, yeah.

432
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,896
Yeah, but they're five times
world champions. We're not.

433
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,500
- [Romain Grosjean] Six.
- Six, sorry.

434
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
[laughs]

435
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,020
[Croft] <i>The magic number is six!</i>

436
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,860
<i>It's Lewis Hamilton!</i>

437
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,960
<i>Champion of the world!</i>

438
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,860
[Bonnington] <i>Get in there, Lewis.</i>

439
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,300
[Hamilton] I can't believe it!
I really can't believe it!

440
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,800
[Bonnington] <i>You did that in style.</i>

441
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,920
[Croft] <i>They are six-time
double world champions.</i>

442
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,540
After taking this photo,
'cause we're on a pretty tight schedule...

443
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,880
When the confetti cannon
goes off, when that photo's done,

444
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,500
we'll then need to leg it back in here.

445
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,720
- 'Cause we're gonna have lunch in here.
- Yeah.

446
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,500
Otherwise, we'll end up mobbed
for half an hour, which, um...

447
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,436
There's a lot of people out there.

448
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,000
There's a lot of people,
so we're last in and we're first out.

449
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,180
We're coming back this way...
for some nosh.

450
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,836
[Hamilton] Should we not
make our way over?

451
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,056
I wanna go and take pictures of everyone.

452
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,700
[man 1] Here we go.
That's the... Yeah.

453
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,760
[woman] Shit!

454
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,816
[man 2] So, no going through the door.

455
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,000
[Hamilton] Damn,
this door is so... [laughs]

456
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,640
[man 1] World champion trapped in door.

457
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,296
[Hamilton] Dangerous doors.

458
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,336
[man 1] Health and Safety executive

459
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,240
would have a field day with that,
wouldn't they?

460
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,940
They'd want to interview you
a hundred times.

461
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,396
Well, I think you got
good insurance, though.

462
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,380
- So I guess I'd just claim.
- [laughing]

463
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,300
[groans] My... My back! My neck!

464
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,460
[man 1] My back! Yeah.

465
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
Millions!

466
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,420
Got a new engine stand this year as well.

467
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,940
- Congratulations.
- [Hamilton] Thank you.

468
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,136
- Congratulations. Very well done.
- [Hamilton] Thank you.

469
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,256
- And to you.
- Thanks a lot.

470
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
[Hamilton] No, thank you.

471
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,420
This is so awesome to see all this.

472
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,540
<i>As a kid, I always knew that I'd do
something great, something extraordinary.</i>

473
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,340
<i>But this has been the hardest year.</i>

474
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,120
<i>The team effort is just... it's humongous.</i>

475
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,220
[crowd cheering]

476
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,160
[man 3 over megaphone]
Come on, give him a wave, guys!

477
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,360
[Hamilton] <i>I just feel really grateful
for the opportunity</i>

478
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,160
<i>to be able to work with great people
and win these world titles.</i>

479
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,600
But I look at it and I'm really
just a chink in the chain

480
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,140
of a massive chain
of over a thousand people.

481
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,980
And I'm really kind of
the catalyst at the end.

482
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,640
<i>So, I just feel really grateful
in that respect.</i>

483
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,460
[man 3 speaking indistinctly
over megaphone]

484
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,680
Cheers to the camera!
One, two, three, four, five...

485
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,420
- Six!
- [all cheer]

486
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,840
[crowd applauding]

487
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,500
2020 is set to become one of
the biggest years in Formula 1's history.

488
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,980
Obviously, it's not a very level
playing field at the moment.

489
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,580
The sport has got out of control.

490
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,460
I want to be competitive once in a while.

491
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,320
New set of financial regulations.

492
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,980
So that the big teams
don't have such a big advantage.

493
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,580
Bringing the big spenders
a little bit closer to us.

494
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,776
We need to be ready for that.

495
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,780
[scoffs] Yeah.

496
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,700
They will, I believe,
make a huge difference.

497
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,780
You also have a pretty unique
scenario in 2020.

498
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,700
The majority of the drivers will be
out of contract at the end of the season.

499
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,540
We always wanna be better.

500
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,740
I don't feel too stressed about it.

501
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,620
[groans]

502
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,400
If you ask what it means to win
with Ferrari, I don't know. Because, um...

503
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,240
But I wanna find out.

504
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,340
The political permutations,
the back-door dealings...

505
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,416
You gotta make the most
of your opportunities when you can.

506
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,520
Arm wrestling that goes on
behind the scenes.

507
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,080
The peacock strutting.

508
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,780
It's about, "Push myself against
the best, I wanna be the best."

509
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,480
You're always under pressure.

510
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,100
Diamonds are made under pressure.

511
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,180
I want to be in the fastest car.

512
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,400
Hi!

513
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,880
Make sure that we are that dominant car.

514
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,700
Push Lewis Hamilton all the fucking way.

515
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,600
That's the hardest thing to do.

516
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,780
- It's not going to be easy.
- No.

517
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,580
It's more like a hobby for me.

518
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,020
So, obviously, I don't need
to do it if I don't want.

519
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,040
What are we doing this for?

520
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,160
[laughs]

521
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,760
Next year's gonna be a fun year.

522
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,500
Now we have a new chapter.

523
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,760
We're ready to take it on.
