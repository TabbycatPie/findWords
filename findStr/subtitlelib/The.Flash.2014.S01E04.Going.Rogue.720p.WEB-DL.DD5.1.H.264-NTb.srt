1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:05,938
- My name is barry allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,073
When I was a child
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,009
By something impossible.

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:13,045
My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:13,047 --> 00:00:17,016
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

6
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,718
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,454
But secretly, I use my speed
to fight crime

8
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:24,456
And find others like me.

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,859
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

10
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:27,893
Mom!

11
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,294
And get justice for my father.

12
00:00:29,296 --> 00:00:31,864
I am the flash.

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,699
Previously on
<i>the flash...</i>

14
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,334
- What did you say
your name was again?

15
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,736
- Barry allen.
- Felicity.

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,973
- [gasps]
- how's barry doing?

17
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,674
- It's a secret.
- What kind of secret?

18
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,976
- The kind I have to keep.

19
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:45,878
- I just have
a little experience

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,415
With liking someone who doesn't
see you the same way.

21
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,350
- Dad, the thing is...
- you two are dating.

22
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:53,819
- So you're not mad.
- Oh, I'm mad.

23
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,655
[free's <i>all right now</i> playing]

24
00:00:56,657 --> 00:01:00,225
- What does the fastest man
alive do on his day off?

25
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,062
Before the lightning bolt, if I
wasn't still at the crime lab,

26
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,030
I'd be at home chilling,

27
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,432
But now my days off
are different.

28
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,067
Now they aren't so lonely.

29
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,602
The lightning
didn't just give me speed.

30
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,905
It also gave me friends.

31
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,908
- This isn't even remotely
anatomically correct.

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,244
- That's not the point,
dr. Snow.

33
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,413
- Then what is the point?

34
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,248
- To have fun.

35
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,584
- And to continue your ongoing
training by testing the speed

36
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:29,788
Of your mind by pushing
your ability to multitask.

37
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,195
- I'm waiting on you, dr. Wells.

38
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,478
- 182 seconds, gentlemen.

39
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:03,689
- Heads up!
I think we got something.

40
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,341
2-11, 2-11.
We're being robbed!

41
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,820
- Hey, cool it.

42
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,023
158 seconds to go.

43
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,662
- Checkmate.

44
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,597
- Wait, checkmate?
- Checkmate.

45
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,699
I guess we still have
a few things left to learn,

46
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,867
Don't we, mr. Allen?

47
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,769
[phone ringing]

48
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,205
- Armed robbery
at 4th and collins.

49
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:56,675
- For the record, I crushed it
in <i>operation</i> and ping pong.

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,581
[buzzer]

51
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:05,450
- It's not as easy
as it looks.

52
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,905
[gunshot]
- ugh!

53
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,611
- Where's the nearest hospital?

54
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,413
- St. Andrews...
seven blocks north, two east.

55
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:37,549
- Call the er, tell them
they have an incoming gsw.

56
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,393
- Let's go. I want
this locked up all the way

57
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,230
To the end of the block.

58
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,764
Tow truck was stolen.

59
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:54,733
Driver of the armored car
is in a stable condition

60
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,269
At st. Andrews, and no one's
exactly sure how he got there.

61
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,904
- Did you check
the security cameras?

62
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,439
- Camera's storage drive
was stolen.

63
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,574
Guys are pros.

64
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,643
- Everything's still here,

65
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,511
Including what
I think they were after,

66
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,280
The kahndaq dynasty diamond.

67
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:11,116
It was on its way to central
city museum for exhibition.

68
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:13,986
- Right, iris is trying
to talk me into going.

69
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,420
I'm not much of a museum guy,

70
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,057
But when she really
wants to do something...

71
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,896
I'm just going to walk away now.

72
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,832
- Sorry, captain.
I was at the hospital

73
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,800
Visiting a friend.
- There's nothing missing.

74
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,836
It looks like someone
interrupted a robbery.

75
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:32,404
- Guard says
there was three of them.

76
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,839
- Actually, there was four.

77
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,240
I mean, that's
how many I would bring

78
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,676
If I were doing a robbery
of this nature.

79
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,745
That's definitely
a four guy truck.

80
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,347
A driver, two more
to cover the guards, and...

81
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,183
Somebody used liquid nitrogen
to crack open this door,

82
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,785
So four bad guys.

83
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,956
- Thank you, mr. Allen,
for your brilliant insight.

84
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,591
- For somebody so fast,

85
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,293
You're a little slow
on the improvising.

86
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,128
Did you see anything that could
help us catch these guys?

87
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,533
- Yeah,
one of them lost his mask.

88
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:06,338
I saw his face.

89
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,840
- So look through these mug
shots
of central city's most wanted,

90
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,575
And see if you can find our guy.

91
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,144
- That's him.

92
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,545
- Damn.

93
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,047
Leonard snart.

94
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,082
- Leonard? That's almost as bad
as bartholomew.

95
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:18,750
- Snart ain't sexy, either.

96
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,652
Snart's father was a cop...

97
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,287
Was a bad cop.

98
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:24,523
Took his anger out on his kids
until he went to prison.

99
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,491
- Snart's dad's in prison too?

100
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,026
We should start a club.

101
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,861
- He shows up, like,
every six months.

102
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:32,664
He cases a job for weeks
before he makes his move.

103
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,866
Then,
he does the job... gets away.

104
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,135
- That's before the streak
was around.

105
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,404
- Did you just refer to yourself
in the third person?

106
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:41,740
- I referred to the streak,
which I'm pretty sure I can top.

107
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:42,974
I've been thinking
of a new name.

108
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,242
What do you think
about the fla...

109
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,977
- Coffee break.

110
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,179
Thought I would bring
central city's finest java

111
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,847
Over to central city's finest.

112
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:53,952
- Thanks.
I'm off caffeine.

113
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:54,953
- My dad's been mad
at me every since I told him

114
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:56,955
About me and eddie.

115
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,657
- No, you mean he's mad at you
because you didn't tell him.

116
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,560
- Uh, first, that sounds
like you're taking his side,

117
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,228
And second, do you know
how he does this whole,

118
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,896
"I'm not talking to you,
but I have a whole bag

119
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,798
Full of judgmental looks
I'm gonna try out on you later?"

120
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,266
- Yeah, I've been
on the receiving end

121
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,735
Of those a few times.

122
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,436
- Speaking of communications,

123
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,739
Or lack thereof, after all
of these journalism classes,

124
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,374
I got an idea.
- Huh.

125
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,075
- I started a blog.

126
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,044
- All right, what's it about?
Your brownie obsession?

127
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,245
'cause, you know, you probably
shouldn't broadcast that.

128
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,980
- No, something important.

129
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:26,585
Something that central city
needs to know about, the streak.

130
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,186
He's out there, barry.

131
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,423
Rumor has it, he stopped
an armed car robbery earlier.

132
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,291
I was hoping that I could take
a look at the file, and...

133
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,893
- What?
I'm not at liberty

134
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,763
To discuss an ongoing police
investigation with you.

135
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,132
- Since when, mr. Blabbermouth?

136
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,733
- Take it from someone
who's been

137
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,935
Investigating the impossible
since they were 11.

138
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,537
Blogging about this is

139
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,139
Only gonna bring the crazies
to your front door.

140
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,974
- My blog is anonymous.

141
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,809
- All right, well,
anonymous or not, it's not safe.

142
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,744
You never know what kind
of weirdos are out there

143
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,979
Trolling on the internet.

144
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,647
- I can vouch for that.

145
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:59,451
The internet is full of weirdos
and nerd rage...

146
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,186
Lots and lots of nerd rage.

147
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,088
- [chuckles]

148
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,858
- Hi.
Felicity smoak.

149
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,627
- Iris west.

150
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,629
- Barry allen.

151
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:12,798
But you both already knew that.
Felicity is...

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,132
- The girl that you met in
starling city,

153
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,268
The computerer, right?

154
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,837
You two worked on one
of barry's unexplainable cases.

155
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,675
- Which, long story short,
was definitely explainable.

156
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:27,546
So the lightning
came through here?

157
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,183
- Yeah.

158
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,321
- There's been some rumors
the last few weeks.

159
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,324
People seen a red blur
tearing through the streets.

160
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,926
What the hell is it, man?

161
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,327
- Maybe it was a drone.

162
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,430
Some top secret army thing.

163
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,836
- When I was a kid,
my grandfather used to

164
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:54,439
Take my sister and me
to this diner, the motorcar.

165
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:57,642
Food was for crap,
but the view was great,

166
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,979
Right across from
the central city precinct.

167
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,448
I still go there.
I listen to their radios.

168
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:06,184
I learn their response times.

169
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,019
There are 40 banks
in central city,

170
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,822
Each of them within 60 seconds
of police response.

171
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:14,826
That's the advantage
of hitting a moving target.

172
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,828
Once the armored car called 911,

173
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,899
We had 182 seconds before
any cop could be on the scene.

174
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:25,103
No one could have gotten there
fast enough to stop us.

175
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:28,940
But something did,

176
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,776
And you lost your cool.

177
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,745
You know the rules.

178
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,548
We don't shoot guards or cops
unless it's the only option.

179
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,616
We don't need the heat.

180
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:41,453
- The heat?

181
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,591
What the hell do you think
the blur is, snart?

182
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,760
Right.
Screw this.

183
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,829
Screw you.
I'm out.

184
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,831
[gunshot]

185
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,601
- Well, if you're out,
you're out.

186
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,574
This blur is a man.

187
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:07,579
We're gonna have to
up our game.

188
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,250
- Iris seems very nice.

189
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,654
And really pretty.
Like, <i>super</i> pretty.

190
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,589
Congratulations.

191
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,424
- Well, iris
isn't my girlfriend.

192
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:23,128
She's just a friend
who actually has a boyfriend.

193
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,965
- Oh, that's... Interesting,

194
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,668
I guess.

195
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,303
- What are you
really doing here?

196
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,938
I mean, it's good to see you,

197
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,940
But do you and oliver
need something, or...

198
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:39,077
- No, no, I came
because I wanted to see you.

199
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,846
I heard you were
out of the coma.

200
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,115
Didn't call, didn't write,

201
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,419
Didn't race over...

202
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,260
- Oliver told you?

203
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,062
- Honestly, I heard
you two talking

204
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,784
On that rooftop
in stirling city that night.

205
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,170
I want to see it.

206
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,938
And by "it,"
I mean your speed,

207
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,139
In case you thought I was
talking about something else,

208
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,977
Which I... which I was not.
- Okay.

209
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,845
Okay, you see that building?

210
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,847
- Uh-huh.

211
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,949
- Keep your eyes on it.

212
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,156
Whoo-hoo!

213
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,825
- Whoa.
[gasps]

214
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,793
You took a picture of me?

215
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,261
From the top of that building?

216
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,631
- Yeah.
Don't instagram that.

217
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,899
- Unbelievable.
- [chuckles]

218
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,334
- Your shoes are smoking.

219
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,574
- That... that's fine.
It's... it happens sometimes.

220
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:44,976
It's why I have
a friction-proof suit.

221
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,512
- Where did you get that?

222
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,347
- I'll show you.

223
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,394
- And this is where my team
monitors the police bands

224
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,162
For criminal activity.

225
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,664
We can track anything
that's happening in the city.

226
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,865
Check this out.

227
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,033
We've got our own satellite.

228
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,501
- I know.

229
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,002
I've hacked into it
from time to time.

230
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,637
- Rude.
- It is, of course,

231
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,973
So wonderful to see you again,
felicity.

232
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,574
I'm just wondering

233
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,744
How much of our operation
she needs to know about.

234
00:11:19,746 --> 00:11:21,246
- I'm really good
at keeping secrets.

235
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,714
- Yeah, felicity works
with the arrow.

236
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:25,917
- Sweet.
- And you apparently are not.

237
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,752
- Now it's all making sense.

238
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,220
You know who the arrow is.

239
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:32,390
Wait, do you know
who the arrow is?

240
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:35,827
- Uh...

241
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,796
- Let's just say that my team
has a similar set up,

242
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,998
But with...
More pointy objects.

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,901
- Welcome, ms. Smoak.

244
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,369
- Dr. Wells?

245
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,870
<i>The</i> dr. Wells?

246
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,007
- Please, call me harrison,
felicity.

247
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,141
- Oh, you know who I am?

248
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,576
- Ranked second in

249
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,011
The national informative
technology competition

250
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,312
At age 19,

251
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,314
Graduated m.I.T.
With masters degree

252
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:58,149
In cyber security
and computer sciences.

253
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,884
I know who you are.

254
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,054
I keep an eye out for promising
talent in scientific fields.

255
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,523
It's what brought me cisco,
caitlin,

256
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:11,396
And I foresaw great things
from you.

257
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,631
- Speaking of great things,

258
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,366
Want to see something cool?

259
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,738
- How fast can he run?

260
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,272
- He hasn't reached
his top speed yet,

261
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:23,475
Theoretically speaking.

262
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:25,076
- So is he really okay?

263
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,212
- His heart rate is
within normal range for him.

264
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,715
- No, I mean,
the lightning bolt changed him.

265
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,617
Do any of you really
know how much?

266
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:35,253
- We know a fair amount.

267
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,055
- If everything
about him is sped up,

268
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,423
Is he going to age faster?

269
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,358
What would happen
if he ran too fast?

270
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,860
I mean, would he just
be running, and then, poof,

271
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:46,030
He's dust in a red costume?

272
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,267
- Everything
we do here at s.T.A.R. Labs

273
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,902
Is to protect barry allen.

274
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,739
Trust us, felicity,
he is in very good hands here.

275
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,142
- Want to see
how fast I can run backwards?

276
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,943
[crash]

277
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,279
- Don't worry.
He heals quickly too.

278
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,286
- Eh, I don't get it.

279
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,088
Why would snart come here?

280
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,623
- Snart's been deterred before,

281
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,191
But once he goes
after something,

282
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,360
He doesn't stop
until he gets it, ever.

283
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,266
- Joe, I want you to know that
I'm really serious about iris.

284
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,502
She's an amazing woman,
and I can really see myself...

285
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,437
- I ever tell you
about that wild night

286
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:29,340
I had my last day of college?

287
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,942
- I don't think so.
No?

288
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:34,445
- Not even after we kicked back
a few beers after work?

289
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,948
- We've never done that.

290
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,449
- Oh, right.

291
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,385
That's the things
I do with my friends,

292
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,655
And since we've never done
those things we ain't friends.

293
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,089
So there's actually no reason

294
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,193
I need to know
about your dating life.

295
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,129
- I just don't want
my personal relationship

296
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:55,033
With your daughter to affect
our working relationship.

297
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:57,101
- It ain't about you, eddie.
It's about her.

298
00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,305
So as long as we don't talk
about you and her,

299
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:03,942
We will be cool.

300
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,379
- Maybe we should just listen
to the radio.

301
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:13,685
- ♪ when a man loves a woman

302
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,387
- ♪ let's get it on

303
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,389
[vocalizing]

304
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,090
[music stops abruptly]

305
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,358
- Quiet is good.

306
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:25,363
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

307
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,564
- Hey, you two.

308
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,333
- Hey.
- We're not a two.

309
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,535
- Oh, no.
We are a one and one.

310
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,070
- Yeah.

311
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,271
- Has barry been showing you

312
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:34,873
Some of the sights
in central city?

313
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,509
- Yes, I have seen
some pretty amazing things.

314
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,179
- Really?

315
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,248
Well, if you've got some time,

316
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,383
Maybe we can show you some
of central city's night life.

317
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,885
- Oh, no.

318
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,554
I get plenty of night life
in starling city.

319
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,422
- Oh, this is something that

320
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,192
I don't think that
you're gonna want to miss.

321
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:55,894
Trivia night at jitters.

322
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,695
Eddie's not really excited
about it, I admit.

323
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,664
But it could be our night, guys.

324
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,467
- Our night to win $75 worth
of cappuccinos.

325
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,069
- Uh, yum.

326
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,571
You know what,
I'm gonna go call work,

327
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,406
Check in,
make sure everything's okay.

328
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,477
I'll be back in a second.

329
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,345
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

330
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,747
- The trivia night
with you and eddie,

331
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:17,615
Forcing this whole double date
thing.

332
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,851
- Because that girl is great,

333
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,553
And she happens to come
from your very rare species

334
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,989
Of adorable nerds.

335
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:27,225
Why didn't you tell me
more about her?

336
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,726
- There's nothing to tell.

337
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,295
She's just a friend.

338
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,397
- Barry, girls don't
just hop on trains

339
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,798
And travel hundreds of miles

340
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,967
To see someone
that they don't like.

341
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:38,236
See, this is
why you need my help.

342
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,437
Bring her tonight.

343
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,240
We'll have fun.

344
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,776
- Yeah, fun.

345
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,015
- You wanted state of the art,
snart.

346
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,117
I bring you state of the art,
my good sir.

347
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,586
- What's this?
- It might not look like much,

348
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:58,056
But never judge a book
by its cover, you know?

349
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:01,092
Fires highly concentrated,
combustible liquid fuel

350
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,328
That ignites on contact
with the air.

351
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,296
- I don't need
to heat things up.

352
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:09,500
I need to slow them down.

353
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:10,702
- That's the one, then.

354
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,570
You were drawn right to it.

355
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:16,007
Stolen from s.T.A.R. Labs
after the incident,

356
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,875
And with nothing
but a skeleton security crew

357
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,244
To guard the tech inside.

358
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:23,414
Emits some sort of substance.
I'm not sure what it is.

359
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,751
Like a white flame,
but it's not hot, it's cold.

360
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,252
- Glasses look like they're made
of the same tech.

361
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,854
What are they for?

362
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,857
- The glare.
You'll see.

363
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,226
- Who else knows you took this?

364
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,228
- Just us.

365
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,531
- No, just me.

366
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,333
Sorry, pal.

367
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,679
- Party people,

368
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,847
Who's ready to
get their trivia on?

369
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,715
[applause and cheering]

370
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,484
Okay, everybody, welcome.
We've got some new challengers.

371
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:04,355
Please, welcome e=mc hammer.

372
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,658
- No, you see, I did it
because e=mc squared

373
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,528
Is einstein's formula
for kinetic energy, right?

374
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,697
And, you know,
<i>can't touch this.</i>

375
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,599
- That's great, barry.

376
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,667
- So where is felicity?

377
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,069
- I'm not sure.

378
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,038
I told her it started at...

379
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,543
- Feel free to buy
yourself that dress.

380
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,548
- [laughs] I totally overdressed
for trivia night.

381
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,383
- No, you look amazing.

382
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,386
- Yeah, you do.

383
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,822
- E=mc hammer.

384
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,524
That's funny.

385
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,927
- See?

386
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,263
- It wasn't until 1852,

387
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,899
When the transcontinental
railroad laid their tracks

388
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,600
Through this thriving
cattle town,

389
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,003
That we became
officially incorporated.

390
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:55,573
That same year, the worst flood
this area's ever seen hit.

391
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,744
But from that disaster rose
central city's greatest hero,

392
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,414
Cattle rancher
bobby "bovine" mcfeely.

393
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:07,518
Bovine mcfeely saved 17 cows
from the great flood.

394
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,521
- Hey, kid.
Gum?

395
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,932
- And now, for the exhibit

396
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,101
I'm sure you've all
come here to see,

397
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,138
The historic kahndaq
dynasty diamond.

398
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,739
Be careful.
Get too close

399
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,142
And you'll set off
the proximity alarms.

400
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:33,244
- Wouldn't want to do that.

401
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,418
[phone dialling]

402
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,353
[line trilling]

403
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,656
[indistinct chatter]

404
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,325
- Three is pasteur.
- Mm-mm.

405
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,560
Three is erdel,
and four is pasteur.

406
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,929
- Right.
- Five?

407
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:52,997
Both: Descartes.

408
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,066
- Are they even speaking
english?

409
00:18:55,068 --> 00:19:00,805
- And the points
go to e=mc hammer.

410
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,975
- I knew you two
would make a good team.

411
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,877
- So, felicity, what do you do?

412
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,245
- I work in computer sciences

413
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,547
At queen consolidated.
- Really?

414
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,984
- Do you have a boyfriend
in starling city?

415
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,687
- No, no, there is no one.

416
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:18,122
- I'll get us some more drinks.

417
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,624
- And I had too many
of those first ones,

418
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,626
So I will be right back.

419
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,702
- What?
- Dude.

420
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,671
- Dude? Wha...

421
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,073
- Are you still gonna tell me
that she's not into you?

422
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,142
Look at that dress.

423
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,677
And when I asked her
the boyfriend question,

424
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,179
She froze.

425
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,648
- Yeah, you were
particularly sly with that one.

426
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,185
- Felicity is smart, nice,
and pretty.

427
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,353
And most importantly,
she is the first girl

428
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,956
That I have seen you with
that really understands

429
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,958
And appreciates you
for the amazing person

430
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,694
That I am always
telling you that you are.

431
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,330
She's perfect for you,

432
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,333
So what are you waiting for,
barry?

433
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,071
- How long has it been missing?

434
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,875
- I don't know.

435
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,811
- I'm gonna ask you again,
cisco.

436
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,680
But when I do,

437
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,649
I expect a more specific answer
than "I don't know."

438
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:24,021
Now, how long has this weapon
been gone?

439
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:26,724
- A day, maybe two.

440
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,627
One of the janitors didn't
show up for work this morning.

441
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,562
He was probably the one
who took it.

442
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,199
I didn't think that...

443
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,867
- You didn't think,

444
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:40,238
Because if you had, you would
have discussed with me

445
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,539
First your desire to build
something that could,

446
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,740
In theory, hurt anyone,

447
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,310
And in particular,
barry allen.

448
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,979
- I'm sorry.

449
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:50,047
If you just let me explain...

450
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,849
- You know how I feel
about weapons, cisco.

451
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,584
They do not belong
in s.T.A.R. Labs.

452
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,788
Now, you are gonna figure out
a way to locate this gun,

453
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,058
And you are gonna
do it right now.

454
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,301
- This thing you built,
what can it do?

455
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,906
- Bad stuff.

456
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:18,643
- You said to call if
there was anything suspicious.

457
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,578
This guy went through the tour
twice.

458
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,647
Nobody does that.

459
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,422
- This is detective west.

460
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,057
I have a visual on leonard snart
at the museum.

461
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:35,293
Requesting immediate back up.

462
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:38,462
[buzzer]

463
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,231
- I'm sorry.
I thought I knew it,

464
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,733
And I got excited,
and I... I just hit it.

465
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,636
- No, I mean,
maybe they'll get it wrong too.

466
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,571
- Oh, yeah.
I am sure that the team

467
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,573
Named pride and padawans
doesn't know the name

468
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:54,578
To han solo's ship.

469
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,049
- Oh, honey, you are so cute
when you're confused.

470
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,522
[cell phone beeping]

471
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,624
- Someone spotted snart.

472
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:11,462
I gotta go.
- I'll cover for you.

473
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,331
- All right, what are you
gonna say?

474
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,699
- I usually tell people oliver's
at a night club with a girl

475
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:15,933
Or nursing a hangover.

476
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,335
- None of which will work
for me.

477
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,969
- Bad stomach ache...
really bad diarrhea.

478
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,137
- Yeah, I'm not comfortable
with that excuse.

479
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,272
- Just go.

480
00:22:21,274 --> 00:22:23,107
Stay safe.

481
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:26,010
And I'm talking to air now,
which is odd.

482
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:27,945
And I'm still doing it.

483
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,324
[tires squealing]

484
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,460
[horn honking]

485
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,097
- Snart!

[gun clicks, whirs]

490
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,865
- You okay?
- Ahh, aah, it burns.

491
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:31,175
- Time for a test run.

492
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,911
Let's see how fast you are.

493
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,084
- Gah!

494
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,452
[strained breathing]

495
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,901
No!

496
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,580
No.

497
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,118
I couldn't...

498
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,526
- It's still numb.

499
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,428
- It's presenting itself
like third degree frostbite.

500
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,863
- I thought
he had hyper healing.

501
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,431
- It's been slowed.

502
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,999
If your cells
weren't regenerating at the rate

503
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:31,535
They are, your blood vessels
would have frozen solid

504
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,437
And the nerve damage
would have been permanent.

505
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,839
You're lucky to be alive.

506
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,874
- Snart wasn't
another meta-human.

507
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,175
He has some kind of gun.

508
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,377
It froze things,
slowed me down...

509
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,948
Enough that I wasn't in time
to save someone.

510
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,516
- According to his record,

511
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:47,151
Snart didn't even bother
to finish high school,

512
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,855
So how did he build a handheld
high tech snow machine?

513
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,023
- S.T.A.R. Labs
built the cold gun.

514
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:57,761
- Dr. Wells and caitlin
had nothing to do with this.

515
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:01,866
I built the gun.

516
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,201
- You did?

517
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:05,436
Why?

518
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:08,539
- Because speed
and cold are opposites.

519
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,174
Temperature is measured

520
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,343
By how quickly the atoms
of something are oscillating.

521
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,178
The faster they are,
the hotter it is,

522
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,881
And when then are cold, they're
slower on the atomic level.

523
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:19,116
When there's no movement at all,
it's called...

524
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,619
- Absolute zero.

525
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,354
- Yeah.

526
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:28,926
I designed a compact cryo engine
to achieve absolute zero.

527
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:31,262
I built it to stop you.

528
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:34,398
I didn't know
who you were then, barry.

529
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,101
I mean, what if you turned out
to be some psycho,

530
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:38,369
Like mardon or nimbus?

531
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,938
- But I didn't.
Did I?

532
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,875
- We built the entire structure
you're standing in to do good,

533
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,443
And it blew up.

534
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:48,679
In the wake of that,
you can understand why cisco

535
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,447
Would want
to be prepared for the worst.

536
00:25:50,449 --> 00:25:52,783
- I can understand that,
but what I can't understand

537
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55,619
Is why you didn't tell me
what you did.

538
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,121
I mean,
after all we've been through,

539
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:58,489
I thought you trusted me.

540
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:00,491
I thought we were friends.
- We are, barry.

541
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:02,393
- I mean, if you
would have just told me,

542
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:04,328
I could have been prepared.

543
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,263
But instead,
someone died tonight.

544
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,468
- And I have to live with that.

545
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,406
- No, cisco.
We all do.

546
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:22,313
- [on television]
theatergoers remain shaken

547
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:24,415
After surviving tonight's
brutal and bizarre attack

548
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,417
In a downtown theater...

549
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:28,485
- The news... are you okay?

550
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:31,255
- I'm fine.

551
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,490
- How long is this gonna go on?

552
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:36,093
Seems like the cold treatment
is going around.

553
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,561
- Not now, iris, please.

554
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,730
- Yes, now.

555
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,565
You did the same thing
when I tried to sign up

556
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:43,500
For the police academy
without telling you.

557
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,269
You didn't speak to me
for weeks...

558
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,237
Not until I withdrew
my application.

559
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,807
Well, I am not withdrawing
this time, dad.

560
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,242
I am dating eddie
whether you like it or not.

561
00:26:52,244 --> 00:26:54,011
- Eddie's my partner.
- I know.

562
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,613
- But you don't.
You're not a cop.

563
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:58,015
You don't know
what having a partner means.

564
00:26:58,017 --> 00:27:01,018
Wherever I go, he goes,

565
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,321
And where I go
isn't always safe, iris.

566
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,992
I need to be 100% focused.

567
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:11,395
Now, there's a part
of me that isn't focused,

568
00:27:11,397 --> 00:27:13,297
That doesn't see eddie
as my partner,

569
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,566
But as your boyfriend.

570
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:19,069
So if he gets hurt or worse,

571
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,071
And I'm there,

572
00:27:21,073 --> 00:27:23,173
How am I gonna look at you?

573
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:26,210
How you gonna look at me?

574
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:29,013
Now, I'm not mad at you,

575
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:33,851
But that's
why this is so hard for me.

576
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,686
Do you understand?

577
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,225
- We're going back tonight.

578
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:42,626
- Back where?
- To the museum.

579
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,728
That diamond isn't going
to steal itself.

580
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,797
- Super gun freeze
your brain, snart?

581
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,666
The museum's gonna
be crawling with police by now,

582
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,534
And the streak.
- This can stop the streak.

583
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:53,137
It hurt him,
and I know his real weakness.

584
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:56,140
So we go, unless you want out.

585
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:59,710
- We both want out... Alive.

586
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:02,613
- So you thought ahead
and made a plan.

587
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:06,283
Least I taught you something.

588
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,052
So what are you waiting for?

589
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:11,055
Shoot me.

590
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:13,223
You better put a bullet
in my brain right now,

591
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,059
Because if you don't,

592
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,628
If I ever see either one
of you again...

593
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,897
- You don't get it, do you?

594
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,299
This blur is out there,

595
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:25,202
And central city
ain't your playground anymore.

596
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,643
- Sure, it is.

597
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,219
- Barry?

598
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,522
Barry.

599
00:28:45,524 --> 00:28:48,525
- What?
What are you doing?

600
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,761
You should go back
to your hotel.

601
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:53,297
Get some sleep.
- You should too.

602
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,300
Not go back to my hotel...
I meant get some sleep.

603
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,206
- I can't.

604
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,475
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that man's face.

605
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,214
I watched him die.

606
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,686
I have to go faster.

607
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:18,522
- Barry, it's not your fault.

608
00:29:18,524 --> 00:29:20,090
And it's not cisco's, either.

609
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,658
Barry, I know you're upset,

610
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,028
But you have to look at this
from his point of view.

611
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,997
- No, I get it.

612
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,766
He didn't trust me.

613
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:31,769
- Barry, when you met us...
me, oliver, and dig...

614
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,838
We were this well-oiled
archery machine.

615
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,107
But it didn't start out
that way.

616
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,276
And unlike you guys, we weren't
tossed together overnight.

617
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,446
We came together one at a time.

618
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,214
Believe me, it took much more
than watching oliver

619
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:46,683
Do the salmon ladder
to make me trust him.

620
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,121
- [scoffs]

621
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:04,501
- I've seen firsthand
what this life can do to people.

622
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,503
It's a lonely path.

623
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:10,107
Don't make it
any lonelier than it has to be.

624
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:25,189
- Freeze!

625
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,124
- You want to end up
like that door?

626
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,434
Hi there.

627
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,638
- I figured out a way
to track captain cold.

628
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,507
- You gotta stop
naming these guys.

629
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,044
- Barry, listen to him.
- How?

630
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:50,147
- The cold gun is powered
by an engine control unit,

631
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:52,482
A microcomputer that regulates
air-to-fuel ratios

632
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,884
So the sub-cooled fluid

633
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:55,886
In the chambers don't overflow
and...

634
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:57,621
- Explode.
- Right.

635
00:30:57,623 --> 00:31:00,991
This e.C.U.Was receiving updates
wirelessly from my tablet.

636
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:03,827
If I boost the signal
using central city's network

637
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,195
And send a false update,

638
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,563
We'll get a ping back,
and then...

639
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,099
- We can locate snart.

640
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,667
- How long will it take?

641
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,369
- First I have to hack
into the city's network,

642
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,238
So I don't know, 30 minutes,
maybe?

643
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,039
- I can do it in less than one.

644
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,041
When it comes to hacking,
I'm the fastest woman alive.

645
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,545
Ow! That was not as bad ass
as I pictured.

646
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,382
All right, I'm in.

647
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:26,750
- Are you kidding?

648
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:29,453
- All right,
I'm sending the updates.

649
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:30,888
We're connected.

650
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,923
- Network is triangulating
the location.

651
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,092
- We got him.
He's heading west on nelson

652
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,927
Toward the train station.

653
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:39,396
- If he's leaving, it appears
mr. Snart may have gotten

654
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,332
What he came for.

655
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,101
- When we put our minds to it,

656
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,570
Dude, nothing can stop us.

657
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,605
Oh, you turned your ear
piece off.

658
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,741
How are we gonna talk
to each other?

659
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:53,043
- I don't feel
like talking right now.

660
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,183
- [over radio]
all available units,

661
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,986
Suspect spotted at
central city train station.

662
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,355
- We got snart.

663
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,058
- Wait here for back up.
- Wait for back up? No way.

664
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,626
- That's an order.

665
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,132
- You should go after barry.
- You heard him, felicity.

666
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,566
- He wants to do this alone.

667
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:17,968
- Of course, he said that.

668
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,169
He's hurt.

669
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,971
You're his team and his friends.

670
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:23,273
If I had a nickel for every time
the arrow told me to back off,

671
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,275
I would be as rich
as oliver queen,

672
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,145
Who I mention because he's
the richest person I know,

673
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,646
Or used to be.

674
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,182
The point is,

675
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:34,685
You have your partner's back

676
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:38,655
No matter what.

677
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:41,925
- I have something
that might help.

678
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,002
[gunshot]

679
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,805
- I'm your partner,
not your assistant.

680
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,491
- There's nowhere to run.

681
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,193
- I didn't see you before.

682
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:19,529
Your mom know you're out
past your bedtime?

683
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,665
- If you wanted to get away
you should've taken something

684
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,333
Faster than a train.

685
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,069
- That's if I wanted
to get away.

686
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:28,972
I've seen your weakness
at the armored car,

687
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,674
Then at the theater.

688
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,310
See, while you're busy
saving everybody,

689
00:33:33,312 --> 00:33:35,712
I'll be saving myself.

690
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,728
Good luck with that.

691
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:31,868
- Ahh!

692
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,205
- Pretty fast, kid,

693
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:37,607
But not fast enough.

694
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,650
- Thank you.

695
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:47,818
- For what?

696
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,986
- You forced me to up my game,

697
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:51,288
Not only with this gun,

698
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,790
But with how I think
about the job.

699
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,459
It's been educational.

700
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:59,129
- Drop it.
[gun whirring]

701
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:00,897
This is a prototype cold gun,

702
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:05,669
Four times the size,
four times the power.

703
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,804
- I was wondering
who you were talking to.

704
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:10,841
- Hey, unless you want a taste
of your own medicine,

705
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:11,843
I'd back the hell up.

706
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,076
- Your hands are shaking.

707
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,845
You've never killed anyone.

708
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:17,547
- There's a first time
for everything, captain cold.

709
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,485
I will shoot you.

710
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:29,059
- You win, kid.

711
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:31,161
I'll see you around.

712
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,034
- Hey, leave the diamond.

713
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,137
- Don't push your luck.

714
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,843
[machine powering down]

715
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,678
- Couldn't shoot him
if I wanted to.

716
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,516
This is actually
the s.T.A.R. Labs vacuum cleaner

717
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:54,251
With a lot of l.E.D.S.

718
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:58,588
- Let's get you warm.

719
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,423
- Thank you.

720
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,969
- We've been
trying to track snart,

721
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:17,774
But he must have
disconnected the signal somehow.

722
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:22,479
- We'll find him,
cisco, together.

723
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,317
- You have a great team here,
barry.

724
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:32,822
Speaking of teams, I should
probably get back to mine.

725
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,559
- It was nice meeting you,
ms. Smoak.

726
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:38,128
Please extend a hello
to the arrow for us.

727
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,197
- I will.

728
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,069
- Good-bye, felicity.

729
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,905
- Bye, barry.

730
00:37:01,085 --> 00:37:03,153
- Remarkable young woman.

731
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:05,789
She's special.

732
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:08,124
- Yeah, she is.

733
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,833
- Cisco,

734
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:22,005
Don't you ever
do anything like that again.

735
00:37:22,007 --> 00:37:25,842
Do you understand me?

736
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,211
- Yes, sir.

737
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,693
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

738
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,500
If you're looking for eddie,
he's in evidence.

739
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,136
- I am looking for you.

740
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:55,272
I came to apologize... Again.

741
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:57,507
- [chuckles]

742
00:37:57,509 --> 00:38:00,610
You're really trying to hit
that magic number, aren't you?

743
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,280
- Look, dad,
I just want you to know

744
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,582
That there is nothing
that you could do

745
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,584
That would ever change the way
that I look at you.

746
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:09,286
And I'm sorry.

747
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,787
I should have thought
about how

748
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,222
It would affect you
if eddie and I...

749
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,257
- Listen...

750
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:17,227
Chasing down
this snart character tonight?

751
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:19,529
He had the draw on me.

752
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:23,333
Eddie saved my life.

753
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:26,169
Maybe I underestimated him.

754
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:29,773
- From now on,
no more secrets.

755
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:36,279
- No more secrets.

756
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,853
Well, go see eddie.
- Okay.

757
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,690
- Thank him for watching out
for your old man.

758
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,509
- [yelps]
- [laughs]

759
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,610
- Did I just yelp?

760
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,179
- Yeah.
- I yelped.

761
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,814
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

762
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,615
- Don't tell me
you're here to save me.

763
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:14,684
- Taking the train is still one
of the safest ways to travel.

764
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,820
- I thought that was airplanes.

765
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,822
- Mm...

766
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:25,061
- You remember when you told me
you had a little experience

767
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,330
Liking somebody
who didn't see you the same way?

768
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,301
That was iris, right?

769
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,839
- How did you know?

770
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:38,241
- It's the little things.

771
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:41,444
The way you linger on her
when she isn't looking,

772
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:45,148
The smile you fake
to play the part,

773
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,751
Quiet dreams
you keep to yourself.

774
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:54,324
- Like you and oliver.

775
00:39:54,326 --> 00:39:56,092
Takes one to know one.

776
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,601
I'm afraid
it'll change everything.

777
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:07,404
- It will,

778
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,806
But maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

779
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,611
What is wrong with us?

780
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:17,947
We are perfectly perfect
for each other.

781
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:21,951
- Yet we're sitting here,
pining for people we can't have.

782
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,788
I guess what they say is true.

783
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,623
Opposites do attract.

784
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,796
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

785
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,297
- Same.

786
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,932
Well, as fast I can run,

787
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,501
Which might take me a while,
but I will still come.

788
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,244
- Bye, felicity.

789
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:10,700
- Bye, barry.

790
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:12,402
- Whoo-hoo!

791
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,579
- I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

792
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:25,348
I know it didn't go so well
for you,

793
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,983
And I know I said
we were finished.

794
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,651
But things have changed.

795
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,487
If I want to keep
working in central city,

796
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:33,089
I'm gonna need
a new kind of crew.

797
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,225
I'm gonna need someone like you.

798
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:37,227
You're tolerant of extremes.

799
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,863
You have certain skills.

800
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:44,200
You just need some direction.

801
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:47,470
And I can give that to you.

802
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:49,973
You still like playing
with fire?

803
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:52,842
You're gonna love this.

804
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,711
So...

805
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:58,081
Are you in,
mick, or are you out?

806
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,415
- [chuckles]

807
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:02,218
Yeah, buddy.
I'm in.

808
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,109
- Greg, move your head.
