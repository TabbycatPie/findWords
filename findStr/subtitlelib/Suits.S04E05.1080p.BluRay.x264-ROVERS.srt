coming after us.

It's Sean Cahill.

- No.

You'll miss the opportunity
to get back at Harvey Specter.

Yeah, that was before I knew you were
gonna screw over Sidwell.

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,450
Forstman doesn't throw money around
without getting something in return.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,449
I have no other choice!

- Did you turn off my alarm?

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,729
- I did.
- It's after 9:00.

- I've been sleeping for...
- Almost six hours.

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,962
I know. And the truth is,
you need more.

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,889
- Why would you do that?
- Rachel, you've been running

That doesn't give you the right to do
that. Plus, Harvey's going to kill me.

- He'll get over it.
- And I've got three briefs to write,

No, he didn't.

to be any different.

If I can get Harvey to back off before I do,
then I might not even need it.

for more than 4% of their holdings
in any one industry.

82
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,008
They have to sell a block of something.

But how do you know it's gonna
be Gillie Industries?

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,608
Because I did the math.
That's what I would do.

- There's only one way to find out.

- Mmm, yeah.

you getting a little loan
is gonna stop me,

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,326

99
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,284

Which is exactly where he needs to be
to stab you in the back.

Well, wherever he's standing,

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,169
this is what I'm prepared to offer
Logan Sanders to go away.

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,365
I know I don't need to remind you

105
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,165
that you're legally required
to run that by your client.

106
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,168

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,846
You haven't taken
Forstman's money yet.

109
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,726

and you're just trying to use

110

as leverage against me.

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,805
This isn't a bluff, Harvey.

112
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,321

- Bullshit.

113

You came here to give
yourself a way out.

and I'm not giving it to you.

this is what we brought Malone in for.

- Good, because...

- Now, Cahill's coming directly after you.
- Exactly.

131
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,966
And you're on your way to tell Malone

to legally get us that Wexler block.

134
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,768
I'm not the only one who can
read the papers, Harvey.

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,726
So can you. So can Mike Ross.
He's gonna go after those shares.

- He is now.
- What are you talking about?

137
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,569
- He tried to buy us off.
- And you turned him down?

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,444
Yes, which is why
I'm going to see Malone.

- No, you're not.
- Jessica, we have to...

I'm not saying we don't.

to be the one to do it.

- So, you're not off book?
- Louis,

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,445
if I were off book, would I be pacing

159
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,324
around the copy room
with a script in my hand?

160
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,090
All right. Just calm down.
No need to panic.

161
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,042
- When do you open?
- Tonight.

162
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,367
Tonight? And you're not off book?
What the hell's wrong with you, Donna?

163
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,481
- I mean, only...
- This isn't helping.

164
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,005
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be...
- I knew it.

165
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,121
I bit off more than I could chew.

00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,369
No, no, no, no, no. Just relax.
Okay? I don't care if it takes all day,

167
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,847
we are gonna memorize
these lines together.

168
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,087
- Thank you, Louis.
- No need.

169
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,130
For one canst choke on the joy of life
without thy mouth full.

170
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,969
- Is that the Bard?
- No, it's the Litt.

171
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,969
And roughly translated, it means

172
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,522
when we're done,
you are gonna kick Shakespeare's ass.

173
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,441
M'lady.

174
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,400
- I take it, it didn't go well.
- What gave it away?

175
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,204
Because I know you,
and you don't have your usual

176
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,607
"I'm super cool Mike Ross" face.

177
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,847
If you knew me that well,
you'd know I'm not in the mood.

178
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,042
Mike, I'm not your enemy and
I don't appreciate being treated like I am.

179
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,044
I know. I'm sorry.

180
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,200
So, what did Harvey say?

181
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,771
It's not what he said.
It's what he did.

182
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,729
He knew what I was trying to do
and he called my bluff right there.

183
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,764
He didn't even share
the offer with Logan?

184
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,530
- No, he didn't.
- But you said he had to.

185
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,766
You want me to sue him for that?

186
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,007
- So, what are you gonna do?
- You know what I'm gonna do.

187
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,207
- Mike...
- I don't want to hear it.

188
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,845
I wasn't disapproving.

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,764
I just want to make sure
you've exhausted

190
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,922
- all your options.
- I have.

191
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,082
Then, maybe you...

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,929
Amy, the second I bid
on that block of shares,

193
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,804
I've already taken
Forstman's money.

196
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,881
I'll tell him.

197
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,811
- Sidwell?
- He wants to see you.

198
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,007
You look good.

199
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,329
- This isn't a social call.
- All right, I take it back.

200
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,531
Wexler is divesting
a huge block of Gillie Industries,

201
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,644
and I need you to find a creative way
to buy them for Logan Sanders.

202
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,761
If I'm not mistaken,

203
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,048
Logan Sanders has a TRO
that actually prohibits him

204
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,810
from buying any additional shares.

205
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,287
Which is why you're going to set up
a trust for us to buy it for him.

206
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,245
- That's called parking, Jessica.
- I know what it's called.

207
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,204
- Then, maybe you also know it's illegal.
- I know it can be illegal.

208
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,721
And I need you to figure out
a way to make it questionable.

209
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,802
And here I thought you came in here
to tell me how much fun last night was.

210
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,331
Well, speaking of last night,

211
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,485
you said you blamed yourself
for helping Cahill drop those cases.

212
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,287
So here's your chance to make up for it.

213
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,370
Remind me never to have a moment
of self-reflection around you.

214
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,601
I'm not using this as ammunition,
I'm using it as motivation.

215
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,411
So, figure out a way
to set up the trust,

216
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,000
and do it quickly because
we're running out of time.

217
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,647
You wanted to see me?

218
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,446

222
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,161
I was right out of school. All I wanted
was to get that first tombstone.

223
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,247
Because it meant...

224
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,681
- Your first deal.
- Broke my cherry.

225
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,686
Must have been nice.

226
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,401
It was.

227
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,962
You know what the difference
between you and me is?

228
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,162
I was just an analyst.
I mean, sure I did all the work,

229
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,647
but I didn't do any of the work.
Know what I mean?

- Don't be modest.

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,529
I know I've been on your case.
But the truth is,

232
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,281
you made this all happen.

233
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,802
- I haven't made anything happen yet.
- No. You haven't.

234

And there's a rule against giving out
tombstones too early.

But there's no rule against this.
We can fill it in later.

- You're welcome.

Harvey. Can I help you with something?

245
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,724
Yes, you can help by telling me
how much longer it's gonna take

246
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,922
for you to find me a way
to bid on that stock.

- It's gonna take as long as it takes.
- Well, it better not

or I won't need it at all.

It's so good to hear this
from the horse's mouth.

250
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,809
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means the next time you want me

to break the law, at least have the balls
to ask me yourself.

The balls?

253
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,969
First off, Jessica
insisted on asking you herself.

254
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,083
And I agreed with her because
we're on the same page.

255
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,209
And nobody's asking you
to break the law.

256
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,566
We're telling you to sidestep it.

257
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,922
That's not the job I signed on for.

258
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,646
The job you signed on for is
the job we tell you you signed on for.

259
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,842
That's a bullshit justification
and you know it.

260
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,007
What I know is

261
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,606
there's a reason we make
the kind of money we do.

262
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,849
It's because we figure out a way
to get things like this done.

- That's about all I have.

- maybe I could possibly just...
- Time's up.

267
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,651
- Could I get a day or two off?
- A day? Or two?

268
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,720
- A day. I just need one day away.
- Are you sure that's all you need?

269
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,445
- I'm sure.
- Would you also like me

- to make your bed?
- What?

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,242
Maybe I can triple your salary
while we're at it.

No, that's not...

No, really. What can I do
to make your life easier?

This is law school I'm talking about.

You said a day away. You didn't
say anything about law school.

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,764
- Well, it's for law school.
- Well, this is your law school.

282

we're paying you for it.

283

- I know. And I'm grateful.
- If you're grateful,

284
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,801
then you'll stop complaining
about how much work you have to do

285
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,809
and you'll figure out
how to best manage your time.

286
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,968
But as far as getting time off,

287
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,844
that's not gonna happen if you still plan
on working for me.

288
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,803
Now, you still need a day or two off?

289
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,048
No. I can manage.

but the forfeiture,

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,891

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,690
Why, then that the devil
give him good of it.

293
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,245

I don't need a script.
I'm off book.

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,410
How can you be off book?
You're not even in the play.

are hammering in my head.

ever written memorized,
and I'm on in an hour and a half,

308
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,686
and I'm gonna make a fool of myself.

309
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,644
Donna, forget about my extraordinary
gift and focus on yourself.

310
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,287
We have done this whole play.
You know your part. It will be fine.

311
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,246
It's not gonna be fine.

312
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,849
- Donna!
- I haven't been on the stage in years.

313
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,286
So, you're nervous.

314
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,409
All great performers get nervous.
It brings out the genius.

315
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,841
What if I'm not genius?
What if I'm not even good?

316
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,849
I was pretty damn good, Louis.

317
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,927
I was.

318
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,166
But I knew the odds of somebody
making it were close to zero,

319
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,884
no matter how good they were.

320
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,764
My father lost our money
when I was 13, and I...

321
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,928
I found out what it was
like to struggle. So...

322
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,923
Instead of pursuing my dream,
I chose this.

323
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,402
And that let me pretend that maybe
I was good enough to make it.

324
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,204
But what if I wasn't?

325
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,841
Mmm. All right, look.

326
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,204
I'm gonna tell you something
about myself that I never told anyone.

327
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,560
I have stage fright.

328
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,322
I got it when I was in third grade.
I let it get the best of me.

329
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,041
I never got over it.

330
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,929
And I cannot let you
make the same mistake.

331
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,204
- But I...
- Look at me.

332
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,844
Donna Victoria Paulsen.

333
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,569
You have never been more beautiful

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,525
and talented,

335
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,646
and perfect than you are
at this very moment.

336
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,684
Your time is now.
And you're gonna kill it.

337
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,247
Thank you, Louis.

338
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,170
No.

339
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,287
Thank you.

340
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,290
My middle name is Roberta.

341
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,161
I'm so sorry for that.

342
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,720
. HEY-
. HEY-

343
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,924
- Are you working late?
- You really have to ask?

344
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,843
I thought maybe it would be nice
for us to lie down a little bit.

345
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,521
Together.

346
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,011
I would love that.
But if I lie down,

347
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,202
I probably won't get back up.

348
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,961
I know you don't want to hear this,
but I was thinking about it, and...

349
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,768
Harvey did kind of give me
special treatment.

350
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,850
- Mike...
- He let me skip law school.

351
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,484
(SCOFFS) Yeah.

352
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,329
Hey. Maybe if you just find
the right time to ask him...

353
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,081
I did. And he bit my head off.

354
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,605
So please, just let it go.

355
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,966
- Okay?
- Okay.

356
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,966
I just wish all this Harvey and Logan
bullshit would be over.

357
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,850
Yeah. Me too.

358
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,769
Maybe when it is, we can get
out of town for a weekend.

359
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,485
I would love that.

360
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,688
I'm worried about Cahill, Harvey.

361
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,480
I've checked with everyone I know.
He hasn't done a thing.

362
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,602
Me too.
Which is exactly why I'm worried.

363
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,722
Jessica, I don't know what to say.

364
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,121
If I have to look over my shoulder
every 15 seconds,

365
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,446
I might as well give up right now.

366
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,801
Okay, but it doesn't mean
you stop looking altogether.

367
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,289
- Hey. Do you have a minute?
- Did you set up that trust?

368
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,164
- No.
- In that case, we don't.

369
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,967
- I did something better.
- We're listening.

370
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,247
One of the biggest red flags

371
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,921
at the SEC is a stock purchased
with money kept in trusts for clients.

372
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,850
- We've gone over this.
- Let him finish.

373
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,961
On the other hand,

374
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,288
there's nothing unusual about a retainer.

375
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,887
A retainer.

376
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,806
From what I gather, this takeover
is a massive undertaking, right?

377
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,684
Now, I don't know how you've
structured Logan's payments,

378
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,883
but I think it's time he pay this firm
a hefty fee up front.

379
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,606
And something
on the order of $20 million.

380
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,202
And we use $20 million of our own
money to buy that stock.

381
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,164
There's nothing that prohibits us
from investing as a firm.

382
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,930
And when the bulk
of our legal work is done,

383
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,565
it turns out
he has money coming back.

384
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,247
We may just end up giving him the
shares instead of his unused retainer.

385
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,648
Which we cannot plan or even discuss
with Logan Sanders in advance.

386
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,365
And that makes it legal?

387
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,888
No. It makes it questionable.

388
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,887
Because they still might figure out
what we did and make a case.

389
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,887
"We"?

390
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,882
You tell me, Harvey.
Am I on the team now?

391
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,091
Sounds like you're being a little bit of
a dickhead about this whole thing,

392
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,884
so I'd say yes.

393
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,923
Louis. Do you have a minute?

394
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,643
Oh, no.
It could not have been that bad.

395
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,921
Oh, it wasn't.

396
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,451
It was amazing.

397
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,925
I mean, it was like riding a bike.

398
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,886
I got two standing 0's,
and I've got you to thank for it.

399
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,126
Well, that's great.

400
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,007
What's wrong?

401
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,645
Shylock got drunk at the after party,

402
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,001
fell down a flight of stairs
and broke his ankle.

403
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,407
Which means the show won't go on.

404
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,806
Oh, no, no, no.
The show must go on.

405
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,891
Well, the show...can go on.

406
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,802
No.

407
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,486
Louis. Come on.

408
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,171
- You're the only one who can do it.
- No, I can't.

409
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,120
I wanted to be a molar.

410
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,168
But that teacher's pet,
Dorothy McHale, got the part.

411
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,930
So I was forced to be plaque.

412
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,846
I had to wear this ridiculous
flesh-colored unitard

413
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,724
and drape myself over
my classmates.

414
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,565
And every parent
in the audience laughed at me.

415
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,522
Louis...

416
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,926
And then, the next year,
I got a bigger part.

417
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,968
I walked right out on stage. Tommy
Gallup screams out, "Plaque man!"

418
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,524
Once again, everyone laughs at me.

419
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,291
So, right then and there,
in the middle of the stage.

420
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,321
IIII

421
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,291
I Peed my pants.

422
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,450
So I ran right off the stage,
never went back,

423
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,927
and I am not going back again.

424
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,446
Louis.

425
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,923
A part like this
doesn't come around very often.

426
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,047
You gave me a gift,
and I killed it because of you.

427
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,766
- Donna, please.
- I'm not a lawyer, Louis.

428
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,249
This is my chance to shine.

429
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,721
But I'm about to lose
two more glorious nights.

430
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,127
I've never asked anyone for anything
like this, but there's no other choice.

431
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,291
Please do this for me.

432
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,521
Please.

433
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,810
You want me to sell directly to you?

434
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,322
- I don't want you to. You're going to.
- Why would I do that?

435
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,961
Because I'm the only one who's gonna
buy your block at a premium

436
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,209
instead of you flooding the market with
shares and ending up getting a discount.

437
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,806
That's funny.

438
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,491
That's exactly what someone
else just told me an hour ago.

439
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,602
- What?
- And now I'll tell you what I told him.

440
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
I'll shut everyone else out,

441
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,810
but you two are going
to have to go head-to-head.

442
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,811
You're talking about
a dark pool bidding war.

443
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,570
That's no different than
what you were talking about.

444
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,603
You just wanted to be
the only one bidding.

445
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,762
Thanks for the scampi, Mr. Ross.
It was delicious.

446
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,610
I'll be in touch with the details.

447
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,206
Who's the other entity?

448
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,641
(SNICKERS)

449
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,450
If you can't figure
that out for yourself,

450
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,570
I don't think you're likely to come out
on top of this whole thing.

451
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,801
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

452
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,730
I think I'm washing my hands,
which I'd like to do without you

453
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,968
bothering me about whatever
bullshit you're here for.

454
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,121
Flaw

455
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,562
We'll see if the SEC thinks it's bullshit
that you're buying stock illegally.

456
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,763
You're throwing some pretty big
accusations around for such a little guy.

457
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,126
You think I didn't do my homework?

458
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,123
The registered bidder traces back

459
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,891
to a shell corporation
we used six times last year.

460
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,571
We're allowed to play the stock market
as much as the next fellow.

461
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,246
You think because you're using
firm money, that makes it legal?

462
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,805
You're damn right I do.

463
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,242
Because we have no plan to do anything
other than keep those shares ourselves.

464
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,011
- Now who's talking bullshit?
- What are you gonna do, Mike?

465
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,130
- You gonna run to the SEC?
- You think I won't?

466
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,644
These aren't your daddy's tapes, Harvey.
These are the rules of the game.

467
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,762
Then let me dial their number for you.

468
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,850
Because if you report us,
they'll put a freeze on this sale.

469
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,851
And by the time we get it all
straightened out, my TRO will be expired

470
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,122
and we'll be right back to
where we're headed this afternoon.

471
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,967
(SCOFFS)

472
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,131
You're a sore goddamn loser.

473
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,010
I would be, if I ever lost.

474
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,411
See you at 6:00.

475
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,721
Guess what piece of shit lawyerjust got
himself a seat in the Wexler pool?

476
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,887
Mike, what are you doing here?

477
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,889
What do you mean?
The sale's not till 6:00.

478
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,241
- Didn't you check your messages?
- No, why?

479
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,251
Columbia University called.
Rachel was taken to the hospital.

480
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,002
- Rachel Zane.
- Sorry?

481
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,122
You have a patient here. Rachel Zane.
What room is she in?

482
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,130
- Uh, Miss Zane is resting and can...
- What room is she in?

483
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,811
As I was saying,
she can't have any visitors.

484
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,208
Look at me. I'm gonna ask you
one more time. What room...

485
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,004
[RUE

486
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,009
- She's in 1024.
- You've seen her?

487
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,485
- It's locked.
- I don't care.

488
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,087
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna break the door down?

489
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,851
- Yeah, if I have to.
- I spoke to her doctors.

490
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,167
They said she fainted
at school. She's fine.

491
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,645
If she fainted, she's not fine.

492
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,923
They said she's run down
and a little dehydrated. It's okay.

493
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,769
Okay, so then, why won't
they let us see her?

494
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,291
Because she's sleeping
and she needs it.

495
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,843
Mike. She's fine.
She's gonna be fine.

496
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,927
What are you even doing here?

497
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,407
I'm one of her emergency contacts.
They called me.

498
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,681
Yeah, I know, but...

499
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,041
What's a heartless shithead
like me doing in a place like this?

500
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,321
Yeah, something like that.

501
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,966
I would have come for you if you ever
worked hard enough to pass out,

502
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,161
but you never did.

503
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,201
(SCOFFS)

504
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,809
Look. There's a steakhouse
across the street.

505
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,647
Why don't you and I
go get something to eat?

506
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,683
What, are you gonna break
the door down and wake her up?

507
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,167
No, I'm gonna wait outside of it
and be there when she does.

508
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,563
Yeah, which won't happen for another
eight hours because they sedated her

509
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,365
to make sure she got some sleep.
Now, come on. Let's go get some food.

510
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,844
Don't you need to be at an auction?

511
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,370
Right now, I don't want to be
at that sale any more than you do.

512
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,209
You're saying you're
willing to postpone it?

513
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,091
I'm saying I already did. Come on.

514
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,923
No, I'm telling you, Dr. Lipschitz,

515
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,327
this is like the whole plaque
incident all over again.

516
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:17,603
Yeah. Yes, I have told you
about the plaque incident.

517
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,844
What... At least twice. I...

518
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,161
No, you know what? That's... Forget it.
That's not the point.

519
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,726
The point is, is that I'm supposed to be
leaving for the theater in 10 minutes

520
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,205
and I am a complete wreck.

521
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,687
I have the worst case
of cotton mouth in the history of...

522
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,604
What? No, you can talk
with cotton mouth.

523
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,722
That's friggin' lockjaw. You...

524
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,762
You know something, Doc?

525
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,644
Sometimes I just think
that I've wasted every single

526
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,206
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
for the last 14 years.

527
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,290
You know, this is the first time
we've ever had a steak dinner.

528
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,050
I didn't know you were keeping a tally.

529
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,286
It's pretty easy to do
when the grand total is zero.

530
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,641
I know.

531
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,771
I said I wanted to take you out the night
you told me you were leaving.

532
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,961
We never got around to it.

533
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,606
I never got around to it.

534
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,168
What's the real reason
you were at the hospital tonight?

535
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,281
The truth?

536
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,842
Rachel asked me for some time off
and I all but spit in her face.

537
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,767
- So, you felt guilty.
- Pretty much.

538
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,801
Plus, I knew you needed something
to take your mind off her,

539
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,605
but I can see this dinner
with me isn't working. So...

540
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,041
Here.

541
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,242
Holy shit. What is this?

542
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,922
Louis is in a play.

543
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,008
You wanted to cheer me up
and you didn't start the night with this?

544
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,531
Come on.

545
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,721
I wanted to save something
for dessert.

546
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,729
Oh, my God. That's got
to be a codpiece, right?

547
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,649
What are asking me for?
I don't want to know

548
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,366
- if Louis is packing that kind of heat.
- What, you think I do?

549
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,681
You're the one who went
mudding with him.

550
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,926
It was covered in mud.

551
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,690
- How much mud?
- Stop.

552
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,641
Why would I ask that?

553
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,725
Aw, man.

554
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,130
I shouldn't be laughing at him.

555
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,804
He still hasn't forgiven me
for using Sheila against him.

556
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,370
Mike, you did what you had to do.

557
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,766
You don't think that was crossing a line.

558
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,206
It was way over the line.

559
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,404
But I got to tell you, it was brilliant.
It was harsh, but it was brilliant.

560
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,804
You know, Harvey, I, um.
I never told you.

561
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,808
What you did with Gillie.

562
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,005
I know you had to do it.

563
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,728
Like I said before.
We do what we need to do.

564
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,208
Louis, you're almost up.

565
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,963
Oh, Christ, you're sweating
more than Nixon.

566
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,122
I've gone through four
Elizabethan collars and a codpiece.

567
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,480
Okay, just breathe.
You're gonna be fine.

568
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,601
No, I can't do it.

569
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,962
Louis, we are in
the middle of the play.

570
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,764
You'll have to ad lib.
Make something up.

571
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,445
Say Shylock went away.
Say that he went to Israel.

572
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,527
Oh, my God.

573
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,524
Wow. I don't even know what to...

574
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,807
You know what?

575
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,491
I never thought you'd be so weak.

576
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,085
Okay, why do you got to say
something hurtful right now?

577
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,282
Screw hurt.
Turn that into rage.

578
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,890
Why would I do...

579
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,571
You always turn hurt into rage,
you idiotic piece of shit!

580
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,808
- It is what you do.
- Okay, now, I'm mad at you.

581
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,287
Good! Now, imagine you're in court.

582
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,640
How? It's too hard with the curtains.

583
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,000
- Just do it, dipshit.
- Okay, fine. I'm in court.

584
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,566
- Goddamn it. You happy now?
- No, I'm not happy, you idiot.

585
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,650
Now, you're in court
and you're enraged

586
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,489
and you are fit to kill.

587
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,250
Now, do you see
that audience out there?

588
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,761
- That's your jury.
- They're a bunch of morons.

589
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,887
Yeah. They're beneath
you, aren't they?

590
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,887
- They're beneath everybody.
- What else?

591
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,446
They're a bunch of civil servants
who can't keep up with what I'm saying.

592
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,244
You have absolute and total
contempt for them, don't you?

593
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,886
I want to rip out their stupid brains
from their stupid heads.

594
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,081
Exactly.

595
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,601
Now, get out there
and make your case.

596
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,161
Unless, of course, you're a pussy

597
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,442
and you were only meant
to play plaque your whole life.

598
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,967
3,000 ducats...

599
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,085
I'm gonna head back.

600
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,561
Hey.

601
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,168
Tell Rachel she should take
the day off tomorrow.

602
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,401
Thanks for this, Harvey.

603
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,887
Excuse me. Which one of you is Franklin
and which one of you is Bash?

604
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,844
Did you boys have a nice date?

605
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,843
Couldn't be better. He even paid.

606
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,367
Oh, I guess he's flush with cash
ever since he left you

607
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,051
- and went into investment banking.
- I'm sorry. Do I know you?

608
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,322
No, but I know you, Mike Ross.

609
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,807
Sean here's with the SEC,
and he's using his position

610
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,649
to harass my clients
on behalf of Eric Woodall.

611
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,886
Actually, not anymore, Harvey.

612
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,402
I decided to take your advice
and focus on you.

613
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,686
- Are you following me?
- Oh, I've got guys who do that.

614
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,040
Then, you also better also
have authorization

615
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,130
- from the Justice Department.
- Getting authorization was easy.

616
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,651
Because I told them you two

617
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,524
are on opposite sides
of a takeover battle

618
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,211
and that your girlfriend
is your associate.

619
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,560
Are you trying to say
that we're colluding?

620
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,841
Oh, you went right there,
didn't you?

621
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,847
Because you led him there.

622
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,531
Well, in six hours that I've been there,
this is what I've learned.

623
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,641
Your girlfriend,

624
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,367
who I just mentioned works for you,
faints at law school for five minutes.

625
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,160
You guys meet at the hospital.

626
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,691
Then you have dinner for two hours,

627
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,280
where you cancel a private stock sale
that you both arranged.

628
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,243
And one hour ago,

629
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,169
that stock mysteriously
gets bought

630
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,044
by some shell corporation
set up last year.

631
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,127
Wait. What?

632
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,730
- Bullshit.
- Here's my favorite part,

633
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,285
where you feign outrage
and you feign ignorance

634
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,164
to help sell the whole story.

635
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,287
Anyway, I just wanted to give
you a little heads-up.

636
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,848
Smile for the cameras. Harvey.

637
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,561
You gave me your word.

638
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,681
- And I kept it.
- Oh, yeah?

639
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,767
Then what about that stock?

640
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,847
- Jessica must have done it.
- Bullshit!

641
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,887
No, it's not bullshit.

642
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,725
When were you planning on telling me
this guy was up your ass for collusion?

643
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,922
I didn't know about this
until five seconds ago.

644
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,008
There are only so many things
that I can buy, Harvey.

645
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,566
Listen to me. We can deal
with this guy's bullshit later.

646
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,082
Right now, let me deal with
the stock situation. I'll make it right.

647
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,248
- You can't make it right.
- Mike,

648
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,330
you used to trust me.
I need you to trust me right now.

649
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,651
(WHISPERS)
Rachel, wake up.

650
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,531
Hey. Where were you so late?

651
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,887
I was out.

652
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,007
- Thinking.
- Thinking what?

653
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,891
I don't want to be a fraud.

654
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,288
- What?
- I love you.

655
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,691
I'm married to her.
But I don't want to do that anymore.

656
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,245
I want to be married to you.

657
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,761
- Logan...
- Rachel,

658
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,405
will you marry me?

659
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,731
I can't.

660
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,041
Why not?

661
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,882
Because you'll always be a fraud.

662
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,045
How can you say that to me?

663
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,167
(GASPS)

664
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,686
Hey.

665
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,881
You okay?

666
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,889
Come on, go back to sleep.

667
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,604
I'll be here when you wake up.

668
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,890
- Who told you to buy that stock?
- Excuse me?

669
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,880
Let me start again.
Hello, Jessica.

670
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,968
I just found out we bought
the Wexler block.

671
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,009
Would you by any chance know
how that came to happen?

672
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,483
It came to happen when I found out
the dark pool had been canceled

673
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,647
and I couldn't reach you.

674
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,888
So, you took it upon yourself
to make a preemptive bid.

675
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,967
Of course I did.

676
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,008
If I hadn't, Forstman would have.
So, why are you here?

677
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,571
I gave Mike my word
we'd postpone the sale.

678
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,882
Well, I didn't give Mike anything.

679
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,088
- Do you even want to know why?
- Not particularly.

680
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,690
It was because Rachel
passed out at school

681
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,926
and was in the hospital.

682
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,084
- Is she all right?
- Do you care?

683
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,646
Don't you make me out to be
the villain in this, Harvey.

684
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,408
I am sorry Rachel fainted,
but our obligation is to our client,

685
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,807
and I'm not undoing that sale.

686
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,526
We can't tonight, anyway.

687
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,882
Why not?

688
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,970
'Cause Cahill came out of nowhere.
He's been having me followed.

689
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,482
He thinks Mike and I are
colluding on Gillie.

690
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,841
And if we undo that sale,
it will just fuel the fire.

691
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,849
I told you I was
still worried about him.

692
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,847
What did you want me to do?

693
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,406
Have myself tailed to pick up
a possible tail?

694
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,849
What did you come in here
to tell me, Harvey?

695
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,769
Now that Sean Cahill is involved,

696
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,451
we also can't ever transfer
those shares to Logan.

697
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,291
Which conveniently helps fix
your deal with Mike Ross.

698
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,606
- Jessica...
- You know what?

699
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,960
It doesn't matter.
We don't need to transfer them.

700
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,321
We'll just vote Logan's way
when the time comes.

701
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,522
Jessica, I gave Mike my word.

702
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,451
Harvey, I don't care
if you took a blood oath.

703
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,247
Our duty is to our client,
not a handshake with Mike Ross.

704
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,889
And this discussion's over.

705
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,368
I checked you out. You're free
to go on your own recognizance.

706
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,686
How much was bail?

707
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,564
Oh, it's okay. I took care of it.

708
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,521
How are you feeling?

709
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,566
You know, I'm actually feeling...

710
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,001
I'm feeling pretty good.
In fact, I think that I'm going to...

711
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,481
Rachel, no.
You can't do any work today.

712
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,050
I'm just gonna stop by the office and put
away just three files, send four emails.

713
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,161
That's it. I...

714
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,648
I have to do this just
for my own peace of mind.

715
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,287
No more?

716
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,766
No more. I won't even tell
anybody that I'm there.

717
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,167
I won't.

718
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,881
Louis, can I talk to you for a minute?

719
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,406
Of course.

720
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,524
First of all, you were
remarkable last night.

721
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,842
Who said?

722
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,927
Everyone in the cast.

723
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,962
The Flushing Chronicle?

724
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,327
Um, you know,
I don't actually read the local...

725
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,407
You should.

726
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,170
Because they said I was
a shock to the senses.

727
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,281
I bought six copies
this morning.

728
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,561
I'm gonna send five to Esther

729
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,569
because she thinks she's a great singer.
(CHUCKLES)

730
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,967
Okay. Louis, what I came
in here to say...

731
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,651
- Donna, I'm retiring.
- You're what?

732
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,440
You helped me get over a fear
that I never thought I'd get over.

733
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,441
But I don't want to see
the audience as the jury.

734
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,884
L...don't want to have
disdain for them.

735
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,725
I am the audience.

736
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,166
And I want to love them.

737
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,367
- Louis...
- Donna, I'm sorry.

738
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,691
Because I know I'm taking away
your last glorious night from you.

739
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,801
But I...

740
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,921
Can't go on again. I, um...

741
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,281
I can't do it.

742
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,731
It's okay, Louis.

743
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,967
It's okay.

744
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,291
It turns out that the other Shylock
only sprained his ankle.

745
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,246
Looks like he's gonna be able
to go on tonight after all.

746
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,241
Wait a minute.

747
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,446
He never hurt his ankle at all, did he?

748
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,687
You know, I just knew that you
had a lot of things going on lately

749
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,087
with Harvey and Malone and...

750
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,526
Sometimes, the best way to deal
with disappointment in one arena

751
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,369
is to accomplish something else.

752
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,007
Thank you.

753
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,450
You're welcome, Louis.

754
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,571
Hey. Remember when you said
that you're not a lawyer?

755
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,920
You could be.

756
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,168
I got Donna's message.
What's going on?

757
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,442
How's Rachel?

758
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,246
She's good. Resting.

759
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,923
- Mike...
- Goddamn it, I knew it.

760
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,968
- I knew you wouldn't fix it.
- I tried.

761
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,731
You tried. You're a name partner.

762
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,842
And she's the managing partner,
and you know it.

763
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,883
That wouldn't have made a difference
if you were fighting for you.

764
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,771
I fought Jessica for you
and won more than once,

765
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,888
but this isn't one of those times.

766
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,129
Mike, believe me,
this isn't what I wanted.

767
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,242
My mistake was believing you
when you gave me your word.

768
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,446
No.

769
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,325
I made the mistake

770
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,683
by not believing in you the second
you brought me your takeover plan.

771
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,486
Look.

772
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,848
I don't have a lot of regrets.
It's just not who I am.

773
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,567
But...this is one of them.

774
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,770
If I could go back and change it, I would.
But...

775
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,921
I can't.

776
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,010
Is that supposed to stop me?

777
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,883
No, I just wanted you to know it.
Do what you have to do.

778
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,771
Mr. Ross.

779
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,920
What I can help you with?

780
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,926
Actually, nothing.

781
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,727
Nothing?
What do you mean, nothing?

782
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,126
I mean I made a mistake.

783
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,650
I'm gonna find another way
to win this thing.

784
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,729
I'm, I'm grateful, but...

785
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,445
I'm not gonna need
your money anymore.

786
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,406
You may not need my money, but...

787
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,806
You've got it.

788
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,120
What are you talking about?

789
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,848
You think I didn't know
what you were up to?

790
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,042
You tried not to fund the money

791
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,801
so you could leverage Specter
out of the deal and get out of our deal.

792
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,640
- How...
- Did I know?

793
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,842
I've done the same thing
a hundred times.

794
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,131
I'm actually glad you did it, because now
I know the kind of person I'm in bed with.

795
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,768
A sneaky little shit like me.

796
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,721
(CHUCKLES)

797
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,651
Yeah, but you know the difference
between you and me?

798
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,966
I'm not taking the money

799
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,526
because I don't want
to screw over my partner.

800
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,131
And if I were you,

801
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,841
I wouldn't want to screw him over either.

802
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,770
That man has nothing
but wonderful things to say about you.

803
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,762
You had him take the money,
didn't you?

804
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,686
He couldn't believe
it hadn't happened already.

805
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,404
He told me he's having
a little tombstone made up for you.

806
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,007
[RUE

807
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,124
We are partners on this,
whether you like it or not.

808
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,406
What are you doing here?

809
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,406
I'm here to deliver these.

810
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,887
Who are those for?

811
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,161
Who do you think they're for?

812
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,966
- For you, for your dressing room.
- Thank you.

813
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,447
Let's go.

814
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,727
You're coming?

815
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,804
You think I'm gonna miss
your closing night?

816
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,604
I didn't know you were
a Shakespeare fan.

817
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,006
I'm a Donna fan.

818
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,609
You know, Harvey,
you don't have to do this.

819
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,926
I know you've got a lot
going on with Mike.

820
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,765
The only thing I've got
going on tonight is you.
