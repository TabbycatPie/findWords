1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,430
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,660
If the answers that we need

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,160
to stop Savitar and save you are in the future,

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,560
then that's where I need to go.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,260
You're from before she dies, aren't you?

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,700
You trapped Savitar in the Speed Force.

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,870
Just tell me how you did it.

8
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,520
I had help. Her name's Tracy Brown.

9
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,120
She made the Speed Force trap for me.

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,210
You're telling me my ideas about the Speed Force--

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,670
- I'm right? - In the future.

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,570
We need you to build this trap now.

13
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,150
She was after Tracy.

14
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,420
That means she's working with Savitar.

15
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,530
So you talked to Cecile?

16
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,380
Told her everything. Told her I love her.

17
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,120
I told her that you're The Flash.

18
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,580
Like I told you from the beginning...

19
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,600
I am the future Flash.

20
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,450
It's like looking in a mirror.

21
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,660
Well... not quite.

22
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,120
You're not so scary without your armor.

23
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,760
What can I say?

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,090
I outgrew red.

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,430
I know what you are.

26
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,970
You're a time remnant.

27
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,770
A temporal duplicate.

28
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,990
Created when you run back in time

29
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,520
and meet yourself.

30
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:08,410
You brought a remnant to life last year to defeat Zoom.

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,420
Your duplicate died, saving the multiverse,

32
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,960
and you continued your happy little life.

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,170
And it would've stayed that way,

34
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,530
but then you decided to play God.

35
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,080
You created Flashpoint and changed everything.

36
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,000
I went to the future.

37
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,330
My future self told me that

38
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,740
he created time remnants to stop you.

39
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,410
But you slaughtered them all.

40
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,660
All but one.

41
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,010
Me.

42
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,910
I lived.

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,270
But a funny thing happened when I did.

44
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,250
You. Joe.

45
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,210
Wally, Cisco.

46
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,940
You all shunned me because I wasn't

47
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,450
the true Barry Allen.

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,340
I was an aberration.

49
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,680
A disposable hero.

50
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,380
Future you failed to mention that, didn't he?

51
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,900
How did you become Savitar?

52
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,100
I was broken

53
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,480
and alone.

54
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,110
I wanted the pain to end.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,030
And that's when I realized the truth, Barry.

56
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,550
God feels no pain.

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,480
All I had to do was become one.

58
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,400
And I only need two more things:

59
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,070
for Iris to die

60
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,810
so that you are driven so far into the dark

61
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,410
that I can be born.

62
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,000
And the other?

63
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,270
It may sound ironic given who I'm talking to,

64
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,680
but I'll keep that one to myself.

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,900
What happens if I kill myself?

66
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,430
If I die, then you'll never be created.

67
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,100
Cause and effect's a tricky thing.

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,830
Didn't work so well for Eddie, did it?

69
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,690
Shot himself in the chest--

70
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,450
Thawne's still kicking around.

71
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,420
See, that's the thing about time travel, Barry.

72
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,820
The more you do it, the less the rules apply to you.

73
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,420
But us having this conversation now--

74
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,040
we're changing the future.

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,470
Are we?

76
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,910
My ascendancy is nearing.

77
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,830
When I have control of all of time,

78
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,560
it will be you who is abandoned and forgotten.

79
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,730
You're gonna die right here!

80
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,380
I forgot to tell you--

81
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,510
my suit's cooler than yours.

84
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,970
It's impossible.

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,580
I don't understand. How could Savitar be you?

86
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,150
He's not me. Not really.

87
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,750
He's all the worst parts of you.

88
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,820
It's like in "Star Trek"

89
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,410
when the transporter splits Kirk into good Kirk and bad Kirk.

90
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,910
Please tell me you at least have "Star Trek" on your Earth.

91
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,040
- "Voyager." - I hate spinoffs.

93
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,500
That explains why Caitlin was willing to follow him.

94
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,870
He has a face that she trusts.

95
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,100
Half of one anyway.

96
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,590
So when the Legends found that message in the Waverider

97
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,250
from old you saying "Don't trust Barry Allen,"

98
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,250
it was talking about Savitar Barry Allen.

99
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,500
It's all coming together...

100
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,730
in the worst way.

101
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,790
You said you made Savitar?

102
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,780
How?

103
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,920
Peep this.

104
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,480
Four years from now,

105
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,990
future Flash creates...

107
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,450
a time remnant to fight Savitar.

108
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,860
But Savitar lets that remnant live

109
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,320
so that it can later become Savitar.

111
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,170
So once Savitar is imprisoned in the Speed Force,

112
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,310
this remnant starts to go crazy.

114
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,490
And he goes back in time to the past

115
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,620
and becomes Savitar.

117
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,480
Creating the lie that he was the first speedster,

118
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,800
spreading the myth and recruiting acolytes throughout the ages.

119
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,010
That doesn't make any sense.

120
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,220
Which came first, Savitar or the time remnant?

121
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,580
It's a closed loop. No beginning, no end.

123
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,220
It's just one endless cycle.

124
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,520
Classic chicken and the egg scenario, I think, eh?

125
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,910
A time remnant, it's, um--

126
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,100
it's like a duplicate of you, right?

127
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,550
So it has your feelings, your memories.

128
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,370
So why would it want to hurt us?

129
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,290
Why would he want to kill Iris?

130
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,590
H.R., how's Tracy coming with the Speed Force trap?

131
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,620
Good, yeah, good. Slow.

132
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,360
Get her to speed up, all right?

133
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,040
I'll do that now. Can do.

134
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,240
If Savitar is a version of Barry from the future

135
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,010
and he remembers everything that Barry does,

137
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,370
how are we ever going to come up with a plan to stop him?

138
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,570
What was he like?

139
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,350
Broken.

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,830
You know...

141
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,880
all this time I thought that Savitar is this...

142
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,920
monster.

143
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,450
It's hard to picture what might happen,

144
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,090
and it being you that...

145
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,810
I--I know it's not you.

146
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,070
I'm...

147
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,130
Part of him is.

148
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,640
He said it was like looking in a mirror, and he was right.

149
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,050
But not just the way that he looked.

150
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,210
It was...

151
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,340
it was his eyes.

152
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,790
The pain that was inside them.

153
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,500
I've seen that in myself.

154
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,940
When I think about how my parents died so violently...

155
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,260
Sometimes I want to repay that violence with more violence.

156
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,210
I want to make someone else

157
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,150
hurt as much as I do.

158
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,270
But you don't ever do that.

159
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,070
You're not him. You're a good person.

160
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,590
But it's in there, you know. That's in me.

161
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,620
That power, that pain,

162
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,400
that's where Savitar comes from. From loss.

163
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,310
From losing you.

164
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,590
You're not going to lose me.

165
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,730
Do you hear me?

166
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,700
We are going to stop Savitar.

167
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,710
You are not alone. He is.

168
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,020
And he is not a god.

169
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,770
Jay told me that we're not gods.

170
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,410
He was wrong.

171
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,210
We could be.

172
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,520
Any speedster, and it wouldn't take much.

173
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,890
When the love that we feel in our hearts is drowned in anger...

174
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,330
when the bad memories outweigh the good ones.

175
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,100
What am I going to have to become to stop him?

176
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,550
Hey! Oh, bad time?

177
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,110
No, man, what's up?

178
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,470
I just came up with the best idea ever.

179
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,490
Either that or it's the worst idea ever.

180
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,670
- But... - It's an idea.

181
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,030
It's an idea!

182
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,810
You want to give me a perm?

183
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,160
It's not for your hair, Steel Magnolia.

184
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,950
This is for your brain, okay?

185
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,210
I want to stop you from making new memories.

186
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,760
What are you talking about?

187
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,430
Savitar knows everything we're gonna do

188
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,940
because he remembers doing it.

189
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,960
He's a future Barry.

190
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,320
So what if Barry can't remember what we're doing now?

191
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:44,430
You want to mess with his brain?

192
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,980
Just a little bit.

193
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,730
It's a minimal procedure.

194
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,680
It'll still be the same Barry you know and love,

195
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,210
except he just won't be able to retain new information.

196
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,470
There's two types of memory, Allen.

197
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,670
Short-term and long-term.

198
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,540
Long-term is where you--

199
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,910
Okay, Julian, just stop.

200
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,390
This is my presentation; I'm the expert here.

201
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,550
This is the part of your brain that retains new information

202
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,790
before sending it to the cortex to be stored forever.

203
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,280
So what if we block that chain

204
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,570
with a magnetic disruption?

205
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,430
So Savitar won't be able to remember

206
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,770
whatever strategy we come up with to defeat him.

207
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,110
Which means he can't be two steps ahead of us anymore.

208
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,520
With any luck, we'll actually put him one step behind.

209
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,560
Beautiful.

210
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,300
Cause and effect.

211
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,780
Barry, what do you think?

212
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,730
Let's do it.

213
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,450
Wait, wasn't Caitlin the expert on brains around here?

214
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,880
She was.

215
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,060
But this is something we'll have to do without her.

216
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,580
I trust you.

217
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,080
You won't feel a thing.

218
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,790
Okay, let's get this show on the road.

219
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,150
The disrupter is attached to your hippocampus.

220
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,740
So it's ready.

221
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,550
Okay, ready for zapping.

222
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,010
Can we not call it "Zapping"?

223
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,960
Ready to activate.

224
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,250
In three...

225
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,140
two...

226
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,040
one.

227
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,710
Sweet dreams, my beautiful boy.

228
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,670
- Way to go, slugger. - Run, Barry, run!

229
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,120
I have watched you be in love with Iris...

230
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,250
Maybe we were meant to be together.

231
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,890
Okay, that should do it.

232
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,190
All right.

233
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,840
Right. How do you feel?

234
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,080
I feel fine.

235
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,360
You see? He feels fine.

236
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,540
Barry...

237
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,800
Barry?

238
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,120
Barry.

239
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,170
Who's Barry?

240
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,360
Not fine.

241
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,820
Um, who are all of you?

242
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,900
What's going on?

243
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,790
Seriously, who are you guys?

244
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,710
Okay, Barry, stay calm.

245
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,180
- Who's Barry? - Cisco!

246
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,280
Slight miscalculation.

247
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,720
Slight wouldn't be a word I'd use.

248
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,990
Where the hell am I?

249
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,370
Is this a dentist office?

250
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,610
No, no. This is S.T.A.R. Labs.

251
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,510
Labs? A laboratory?

252
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,420
St--a laboratory? What are you?

253
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,720
Are you guys experimenting on me?

254
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,400
No one is ex-- well, yes, technically, yes.

255
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,260
But--but it was consensual.

256
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,930
- You were? - Yes.

257
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,680
You... Why can't I remember anything?

258
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,670
Why can't I remember my name?

259
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,680
- Your name is Barry. - My name's not Barry.

260
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,540
I don't know what my name is, but my name's...

261
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,970
"Bartholomew Henry Allen."

262
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,010
- That's not a good name. - Look, Barry--

263
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,220
Are you sure I don't go by "Bart"?

264
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,100
Can--"Bart" Feels more natural to me.

265
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,370
Can we go with Bart?

266
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,460
- Bart's kinda cool. - Okay.

267
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,410
- Wally! - Okay, hey.

268
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,490
Let's just get you back in the chair.

269
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,890
No! No, no, no.

270
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,630
I'm not--I'm not getting in the chair.

271
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,430
No, how do I know you didn't kidnap me here

272
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,510
to do some weird brain surgery on me?

273
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,720
Or maybe you're like those criminals

274
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,090
who trick people into hotel rooms

275
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,650
so they can steal their kidneys.

276
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,550
Do I still have my kidneys?

277
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,690
We don't want your kidneys.

278
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,310
Okay, Barry, look at these photographs.

279
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,860
We're your friends.

280
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,330
Your family.

281
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,370
We just want to help you, okay?

282
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,380
That's a nice ring.

283
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,370
Who's the lucky guy?

284
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,680
You are, Barry.

285
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
Look, I know you're scared, okay?

286
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,350
You can trust us.

287
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,320
Cisco.

288
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,730
- A minute. - Yes, sir.

289
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,710
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

290
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,750
- Wally, stay with him, okay? - Me?

291
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,380
So how do we know each other?

292
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,750
Oh, I'm your brother.

293
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,960
There is no sign of any permanent structural damage.

294
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,950
Then why can't he remember anything?

295
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,410
Julian?

296
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,710
He appears to be suffering from some sort

297
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,260
of psychogenic retrograde amnesia.

298
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,320
Amnesia.

299
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,620
What if we didn't account for Barry's

300
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,840
increase neural velocity due to his super speed?

301
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,450
Wait, do we think he knows he's The Flash?

302
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,770
That he has super speed?

303
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,780
Hey, Barry. Catch.

304
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,300
Sorry.

305
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,480
Oh, my Lord.

306
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,440
- He's, like, god-awful. - He's pathetic.

307
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,190
Can't we flip a switch-- undo it?

308
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,190
Okay, we are not flipping any more switches

309
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,020
until we figure this thing out.

310
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,260
It's Cecile. Hey, babe.

311
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,030
An emergency?

312
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,920
All right, bye.

313
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,310
Okay, Cecile needs Barry at CCPD, like, right now.

314
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
She says it's urgent.

315
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,580
He can't possibly go out in that condition.

316
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,580
Okay, um, my dad and I will take Barry to Cecile.

317
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,880
You and Cisco figure out a way to get Barry's memory back.

318
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,950
And fast.

319
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,950
Yeah?

320
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,630
- Okay. - Okay.

321
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,890
You don't want to work?

322
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,070
Well then, I don't need you!

323
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,690
Um, am I to infer that, uh,

324
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,320
you've hit a little speed bump

325
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,390
in your quest to build a device

326
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,670
to trap Savitar in the Speed Force? The...

327
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,030
Accelerated matter microgenerator projectile.

328
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,910
No, I know. It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.

329
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,120
No, it doesn't. How about...

330
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,900
we call this fancy device of yours...

331
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,600
You know, you probably shouldn't--

332
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,430
- Call it the-- - Speed Force Cannon.

333
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,670
Speed Force Bazooka.

334
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,100
Speed Force Gun.

335
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,900
- Speed Force Bazooka. - Is better, yeah.

336
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,520
But if the Speed Force Bazooka doesn't start working soon,

337
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,880
we're gonna have to start calling it the Speed Force Epic Fail.

338
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,870
Why? What's the problem?

339
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,130
The accelerometer.

340
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,980
It sucks a hell of a lot of air watts, which--

341
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,810
Stop talking science!

342
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,800
You need to take a step back

343
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,930
from the Speed Force Bazooka.

344
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,990
- There's not time. - There's always time!

345
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,190
Because sometimes, to move forward,

346
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,990
you have to take a step back.

347
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,840
Step... back.

348
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,390
You see? Yes.

349
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,450
Shake a little...

350
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,600
Shake out those shoulders.

351
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,340
I feel like-- oh, oh, my gosh.

352
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,290
The tension in your shoulders--

353
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,710
Think of something that calms you.

354
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,980
Coffee.

355
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,480
Oh, yes.

356
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,820
But not just any coffee. Piping hot--

357
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,120
- Yep. - Indonesian dark roast with--

358
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,910
Raspberry and coriander--

359
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,760
I've never met another person

360
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,240
who uses copious amounts of caffeine to chill out.

361
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,580
I've never met another person either.

362
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,280
I...

363
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,460
I, I, I'm relaxed.

364
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,920
Are you relaxed?

365
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,210
You, uh...

366
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,440
and I'll...Okay.

367
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,260
I mean... okay.

368
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,380
Good morning, people.

369
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,000
Hi. I'm Barry Allen.

370
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,050
You can call me Bart.

371
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,520
O...kay.

372
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,990
So you said there was an emergency.

373
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,830
Where's the fire?

374
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,490
Ah, it's funny you should put it like that.

375
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,940
- Lucious Coolidge. - Who?

376
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,750
Heat Monger.

377
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,470
The worst arsonist Central City's seen

378
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,720
since Mick Rory went off the grid.

379
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,350
That is, until Flash here stopped him.

380
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,550
What's Flash?

381
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,270
Uh, ah, so what-- what is the problem?

382
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,030
Judge Hankerson.

383
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,270
He's got an opening in his docket,

384
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,440
so he moved Coolidge's probable cause hearing

385
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,620
up to this afternoon.

386
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,020
Barry was the CSI on the case.

387
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,750
So I need him to testify in order to hold Coolidge over for trial.

388
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,440
Uh, yeah, no.

389
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,010
Barry can't do that.

390
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,180
Why not?

391
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,600
What do you mean he has amnesia?

392
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,780
Bar, what's her name?

393
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,450
Um... Felicia?

394
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,090
Oh, my God.

395
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,690
Is this--is this like a--

396
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,110
like a Flash thing?

397
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,250
Was he battling a super villain who used his evil powers

398
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,870
to steal Barry's memory?

399
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,600
Um, no, we sort of accidentally did this to him ourselves.

400
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,260
Why?

401
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,620
That doesn't matter. What does matter is you stalling that judge.

402
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,030
Barry is in no condition to testify in court.

403
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,460
Joe, if Barry can't testify, Coolidge walks.

404
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,140
And then God help us all.

405
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,120
Okay. We'll figure out something.

406
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,190
Please do.

407
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,870
It was nice meeting you.

408
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,620
Oh. Yeah.

409
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,870
You too... Bart.

410
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,000
I got some friends down at the courthouse.

411
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,380
I'm gonna go down there and see if we can delay

412
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,650
this whole Coolidge situation, all right?

413
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,330
I'm sorry.

414
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:16,930
For what?

415
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,570
I don't know.

416
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,420
It just seems like everybody's upset

417
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,210
and it feels like it's my fault.

418
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,480
No. No, not at all.

419
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,990
Look, we just want you to get back to normal.

420
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,190
That's it, okay?

421
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,760
Well, I would, if I could remember what normal is.

422
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,480
I mean, what have you and I been doing lately?

423
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,360
Are we planning the wedding?

424
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,650
Like, are we sending out wedding invitations

425
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,270
or picked a honeymoon destination, or...

426
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,760
Am I a warm weather guy or a cold weather guy?

427
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,960
Actually, we've been a little busy lately, so...

428
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,770
With what?

429
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,280
Um, nothing that you need to worry about, okay?

430
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,590
Okay. You know what's weird?

431
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,880
I know we just ate, but I'm already feeling hungry.

432
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,130
Yeah, let's get some food in you.

433
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,360
- All right. - Okay.

434
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,380
What's that saying?

435
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,060
"Man plans and God laughs?"

436
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,070
Well, men are planning.

437
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,230
And what's the God of Speed doing?

438
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,480
Kneeling.

439
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,690
Brooding time is over.

440
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,380
You revealed yourself.

441
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,530
Now what?

442
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,100
Any idea what to do with Flash and Friends?

443
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,620
Because we are getting pretty close to your big becoming,

444
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,960
and if we don't take them down,

445
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,910
neither one of us gets what we want.

446
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,420
Hello? Anybody home?

447
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,090
What are you doing?

448
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,510
Who are you?

449
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,180
What's wrong with you?

450
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,270
Who... am... I?

451
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,600
Science club.

452
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,460
- Key Club, Astronomy Club... - Yup.

453
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,250
- Yearbook? - Yeah.

454
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,770
- And anime club? - Oh, yeah.

455
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,760
You loved-- loved-- "Dragon Ball Z."

456
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,190
I don't know what that is.

457
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,940
Yeah, I couldn't explain that show to you even if I wanted to,

458
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,250
- so... - Okay.

459
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,860
Sorry.

460
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,870
I definitely had quite the nerd thing going on, huh?

461
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,310
Yeah, a little bit.

462
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,460
I thought you said we were best friends in high school.

463
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,320
Yeah, we were.

464
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,580
Then why didn't you give me some advice, help me out?

465
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,820
Oh, believe me, okay? I tried.

466
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,870
- Really? You did? - Yes.

467
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,180
Okay, because I have evidence that you did not.

468
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,650
Um, I don't remember any of this,

469
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,500
but even I can see how wrong that look was.

470
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,350
This is visual terrorism.

471
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,800
I won't look at it anymore.

472
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,710
What?

473
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,100
You just... you're so different. You're so light.

474
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,180
What do you mean?

475
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,160
I don't know, it's like you're not

476
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,700
carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.

477
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,080
So, what, I was like...

478
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,840
brooding all the time before?

479
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,360
- Sometimes. - Yeah?

480
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,220
- Yeah. - Really?

481
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,160
I don't know, it's just...

482
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,800
it's really nice to see you smiling so much.

483
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,840
I mean...

484
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,460
how could I not,

485
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,440
knowing I'm gonna be with you for the rest of my life?

486
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,350
What?

487
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,120
I got to get to the courthouse.

488
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,090
Oh, yeah, of course.

489
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,760
- Yeah, I got to-- - Hey, yeah.

490
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,050
I'll--yeah, later. Okay.

491
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,150
Okay.

492
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,030
Docket number CC-15-204.

493
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,810
Evidentiary hearing for Central City versus

494
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,360
the defendant, Lucious Coolidge.

495
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,120
I see the city wishes to file...

496
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,800
Cutting it real close, guys..

497
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,300
You ready to testify?

498
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,830
No. No, I'm not.

499
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,980
Yes, he is. He just needs one minute, please.

500
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,590
The prosecution may proceed.

501
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,990
Too late. He's up.

502
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,490
Here. Just take these.

503
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,980
I wear glasses?

504
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,570
You will now. Just put 'em on.

505
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,470
You'll be okay.

506
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,870
Just don't get them wet.

507
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,210
Your Honor, I, uh--

508
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,490
I call Barry Allen to the stand.

509
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,440
Raise your right hand, please.

510
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,810
You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,

511
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,300
and nothing but the truth?

512
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,680
I do, yes.

513
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,590
Thank you. Miss Horton?

514
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,200
- Mr. Allen-- - Can I sit?

515
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,310
Please, just...

516
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,190
You are a crime scene investigator

517
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,600
for the Central City police department, correct?

519
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,850
Oh, this is so cool.

520
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,990
Well, I'm so glad you enjoy testifying, but

521
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,040
please just answer the question.

522
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,090
Of course.

523
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,540
Uh, yes, I am a CSI at the CCPD

525
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,150
under the expert direction of Julian Albert.

527
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,390
Smiley face.

528
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,870
Want to cut it out with the emojis?

529
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,300
Mr. Allen,

530
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,780
can you tell me,

531
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,880
in your expert opinion,

532
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,860
what substance do you see in this photograph?

534
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,200
Uh, shellac flakes.

535
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,920
Shellac is a resin secreted by female lac bugs

536
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,840
found in large quantities of the trees in Thailand--

537
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,540
That's too fast, that's too--

538
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,800
Mr. Allen, are you all right?

539
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,860
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm fine. I just, um...

540
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,120
it's getting hot in here.

541
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,610
What else is unique about shellac flakes?

542
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,390
It's the fire accelerant used in all of the arson cases

544
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,750
associated with Heat Monger.

545
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,540
Such an embarrassing name.

546
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,600
I like it. I think it's great.

547
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,680
And how would you know

548
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,820
when shellac flakes have been used?

549
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,260
We calculate flame temperature and burn patterns,

550
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,390
and a telltale sign is when shellac is burned

551
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,040
into potassium perk-er-lorate

552
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,600
or ammonium perchlorate,

553
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,890
which is considered a high-temperature accelerant fire.

554
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,740
So, then...

555
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,340
would you say the fires in these photos

556
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,870
would be considered high-temperature accelerant fires?

557
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,740
Uh, yes, because--

558
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,710
Mr. Allen? Can you continue?

559
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,240
Yes, I can. I can continue.

560
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,370
The--uh, yes, the fires were

561
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,260
high-temperature accelerant fires,

562
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,180
because the flames...

563
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,850
were, were...

564
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,880
very yellow.

565
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,320
Very yellow?

566
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,320
And that's your expert opinion on accelerant fires?

567
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,850
Mr. Allen?

568
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,880
Ms. Horton, if Mr. Allen is unable to elaborate,

569
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,370
I'll have no choice but to dismiss.

570
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,200
Mr. Allen?

571
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,620
That's--um...

572
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,200
Dismissed.

573
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,010
How'd it go?

574
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,650
Marvelous. They let the pyro go.

575
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,720
- What went wrong? - Everything.

576
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,190
Barry's memory loss is starting to become a problem.

577
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,530
It sure is.

578
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,350
For more than just him.

579
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,670
I don't have my speed.

580
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,580
Not anymore.

581
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,890
And I know why.

582
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,230
If you want to fix this and help Barry,

583
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,160
you are gonna do exactly as I say.

584
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,960
Now this Heat Monger's gonna go free because of me,

585
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,190
and I feel awful.

586
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,700
Barry, it's not your fault.

587
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,530
It's just that now there's a bad guy on the streets,

588
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,240
and I can't do anything about it.

589
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,330
What? Is that not something I would've said before?

590
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,910
That is exactly something you would've said before.

591
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,120
There's just something about you that always wants to help.

592
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,110
This is our place?

593
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,630
How do we afford to live here?

594
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,760
You have great taste.

595
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,570
Uh, actually, this is all you.

596
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,710
I find that hard to believe.

597
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,090
- Is that me? - Yeah.

598
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,340
Who are these people?

599
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,100
They're your parents.

600
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,710
You don't remember anything about what happened?

601
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,900
Why, did something bad happen?

602
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,180
They died.

603
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,340
It was unexpected, but...

604
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,830
they died peacefully.

605
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,140
That's why you came to live with Joe and me.

606
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,470
And that's when we met?

607
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,610
Uh, no, actually, we were friends before then.

608
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,850
I remember the first time that I saw you.

609
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,890
You were the happiest boy that I'd ever met.

610
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,190
I have a feeling that's because you entered my life.

611
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,110
It's okay.

612
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,220
What the...

613
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,650
Barry! Are you okay?

614
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,980
What just happened to me?!

615
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,810
These powers are so cool.

616
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,800
I can literally feel electricity coursing through my body.

617
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,130
I mean, is it always like this?

618
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,300
This is amazing.

619
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,350
We just walked into a buzzkill.

620
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,080
My presence usually dampens the mood.

621
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,210
- Joe, don't. - You fire, I'll fire.

622
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,630
What the hell is she doing here?

623
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,960
- She wants to help. - Help?

624
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,830
With what?

625
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,790
With the fact that I lost my powers.

626
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,090
Barry, why don't you give us a minute?

627
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,550
Sure, yeah. Are you like a super villain?

628
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,030
Just asking. Okay.

629
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,660
How did this happen?

630
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,850
You got rid of Barry's memories.

631
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,390
What Barry remembers, Savitar remembers.

632
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,340
So Savitar's lost his memories too?

633
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,370
Savitar loses his memory, he doesn't go along

634
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,100
with the plan to give Wally powers.

635
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,460
Cause and effect.

636
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,550
But if you let me help you figure out

637
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,410
how to get Barry's memories back,

638
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,970
everything goes back to the way it was.

639
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,110
Kid Flash runs again.

640
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,900
And Savitar survives.

641
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,490
And Iris dies.

642
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,490
Life's full of difficult choices.

643
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,590
Or it isn't.

644
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,930
If Savitar gets his memory back,

645
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,250
what's in it for you?

646
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,940
That's my business.

647
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,780
You think that Barry can become The Flash?

648
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,350
Yeah. He can learn.

649
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,650
I still know how to do everything.

650
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,660
I can teach him.

651
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,620
Okay.

652
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:55,090
Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.

653
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:59,010
But there's still a lot of villains in this city,

654
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,260
and no Flashes to protect it.

655
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,440
Is that really a chance you're willing to take?

656
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,370
- I'm still here. - Yeah, you are.

657
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,450
Because when you left, I stayed.

658
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:15,670
We gotta talk about the elephant in the room.

659
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,840
But you know what, I--

660
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,820
I have a job to do.

661
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,390
We have to build that device.

662
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,580
We've got to focus on the task at hand.

663
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,770
Do you understand what I'm saying?

664
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,520
- I totally understand. - From here on out,

665
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,970
whenever I look into your azure eyes,

666
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,040
flecked with gray,

667
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,850
like a summer rainstorm coming to

668
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,070
kiss my lips,

669
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,410
the only thing I'm gonna be thinking about

670
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,640
is how I can best inspire that

671
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,900
beautiful, sexy brain.

672
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,100
Sparks.

673
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,150
Sparks.

674
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,390
You felt them too.

675
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,840
- No. - No?

676
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,980
No, I mean yes, obviously.

677
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,640
- Oh, yeah. - Sparks.

678
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,030
Jumping between two parallel wires--

679
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,110
a modified high-voltage climbing arc.

680
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,490
I guess my work here is done.

681
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,040
You should never have tried this without Caitlin.

682
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,230
Well, we didn't really have much of choice, now, did we?

683
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,440
Also, don't refer to yourself in the third person.

684
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,370
It's Caitlin. It's you. It's the same person.

685
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,010
It's just confusing.

686
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,720
Hand me the girard processor.

687
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,210
It'll help prime his neocortical and medial frontal lobes.

688
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,350
What?

689
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,740
Nothing.

690
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,280
Oh, golly. Look at us.

691
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,200
Just three musketeers working away.

692
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,230
Just like old times, huh?

693
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,700
Hey, Julian, did Caitlin ever tell you about our time

694
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,690
working on the Particle Accelerator with Ronnie?

695
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,070
No. No, she did not.

696
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,170
There was this one time

697
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,580
we had this very strict deadline,

698
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,600
and Dr. Wells was super hard on us.

699
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,100
All of us, even Hartley.

700
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,540
Who's--who's Hartley?

701
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,340
Oh, he was this guy we used to work with.

702
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,220
Such a dick. You actually reminded me a lot of him

703
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,690
when you first came onboard.

704
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,930
Anyway, so we were working on the iridium plating

705
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,380
for the...

706
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,200
What was it called again?

707
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,910
The synchrotron, that's what it was.

708
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,290
So anyway, we were struggling,

709
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,810
and we were burning the midnight oil,

710
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,850
and we could not get the dubnium capacitor

711
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,340
to hold a single charge.

712
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,060
And so all of a sudden

713
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,600
Ronnie just loses all his chill.

714
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,830
He turns beet red

715
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,790
and he starts yelling at the thing like,

716
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,060
"Come on, you dumb-nium capacitor!"

717
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,300
"Take charge."

718
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,060
Yes!

719
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,200
Yes.

720
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,420
Oh, my God.

721
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,360
I think about all the memories I cherish most, and...

722
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,100
and you're in every single one of them, Caitlin.

723
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,090
Let's figure this out.

724
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,690
I don't want to be here any longer than I have to.

725
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,900
Suit yourself.

726
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,240
Okay!

727
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,250
Guys, I still can't believe I have these powers.

728
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,390
They're amazing.

729
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,510
I mean...

730
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,250
I think that I could be a superhero.

731
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,100
All right, well is it cool if I run some more?

732
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,780
- Have at it. - All right.

733
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,760
I haven't seen him this happy in a long time.

734
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,360
Try ever.

735
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,170
It's the first time he hasn't been weighed down

736
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,410
by the tragedies of his past, you know?

737
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:29,900
First time he's actually been free of them.

738
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,460
You don't want his memory restored, do you?

739
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,520
Dad, I...

740
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,490
I can't say that seeing him happy and light

741
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,210
isn't something I have wished for him,

742
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,400
because yeah, it is.

743
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,510
Sweetheart, I wish that for him, too.

744
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,570
But you didn't fall in love with The Flash.

745
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,070
You fell in love with Barry Allen.

746
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,990
Dad, I know this is a different version of him,

747
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,150
but he's...

748
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,860
he's still Barry.

749
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,210
No, he's not, honey.

750
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,000
Look, until yesterday,

751
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,340
Barry had 28 years of experiences

752
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,540
to define him, and some of those memories were bad,

753
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,980
but some were good, too.

754
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,160
But without those memories,

755
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,500
the Barry Allen we know and love is gone.

756
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,960
I don't know, Dad.

757
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,990
You know, part of me can't help but

758
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,420
think that this is some sort of gift, you know--that

759
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,800
this is the life that he was supposed to have.

760
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,210
Maybe the city doesn't need The Flash.

761
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,100
Hey, everybody!

762
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,670
Happy Friday!

763
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,040
So I am a superhero?

764
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,320
Yeah. A real good one.

765
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,570
You're The Flash.

766
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,500
You sure The Streak isn't a better name, maybe?

767
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,790
Turn on the TV.

768
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,850
Uh, okay. Yeah.

769
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,740
Eyewitnesses say the man who set the fire

770
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,470
to the offices is none other than Lucious Coolidge,

771
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,770
AKA Heat Monger.

772
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,490
That's the guy that went free because of me.

773
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,560
At this rate, it won't be long

774
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,080
before the whole thing burns down.

775
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,070
There's hundreds of people who work in there.

776
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,420
We need to stop it.

777
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,710
How? I mean, you can't right now.

778
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,910
No, but I can.

779
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,780
Barry, you don't know how to use your powers.

780
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,440
- Bar-- - You just said I'm a superhero.

781
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,070
And a good one, right?

782
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,960
I mean, memories or not, I can't stand by

783
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,500
and watch people die if I can prevent it.

784
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,620
Forgot the suit.

785
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,010
Barry? You okay?

786
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,890
Uh, yeah, I'm good.

787
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,880
Stopping's hard.

788
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,660
How do I save everybody inside?

789
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,630
You just run them out of there.

790
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,920
I barely got here myself.

791
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,060
How am I supposed to run with someone else?

792
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,690
There's gotta be something we can do.

793
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,840
There is something we can do:

794
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,460
jump-start his brain using that thing.

795
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,250
We have not done a test run.

796
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,560
There's no time to test it now.

797
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,490
What is that thing?

798
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,380
This can send electrical charges through

799
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,910
the transmitters in his suit and theoretically,

800
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,110
should jolt his memory.

801
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,200
You want to electroshock his brain?

802
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,230
Won't that fry it even more?

803
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:19,950
If we don't do that,

804
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,500
all those people are gonna die.

805
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,670
Life's a game of chance.

806
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,760
Okay, Barry, you're gonna feel something.

807
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,080
Might hurt, might sting, might suck.

808
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,730
- Wait, what? - Probably all three.

809
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,080
Okay, here we go.

811
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,870
Barry?

812
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,890
Barry?

813
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,450
Uh, yeah, I still don't remember.

814
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:50,550
Why didn't that work?

815
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,780
That was supposed to work.

816
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,110
We kick-started his temporal lobe.

817
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,210
Now he just needs to access it.

818
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,560
Gas is in the tank, we just need to turn the ignition.

819
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,960
We need a visceral memory to spark his brain.

820
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,120
Okay...

821
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,570
Okay.

822
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,750
Barry?

823
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,620
I need you to remember.

824
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,920
I can't!

825
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,220
Yes, yes, you can.

826
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,600
Okay? Okay, listen to me.

827
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,120
The night that your mom died,

828
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,420
I didn't want to tell you how,

829
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,450
but she didn't die peacefully.

830
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,090
She was murdered.

831
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,300
What?

832
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,150
And you came to live with us.

833
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,870
My dad brought you inside,

834
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,400
and you were in shock. You weren't crying.

835
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,390
And later that night,

836
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,450
a sound woke me, and I crawled out of my bed,

837
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,620
and I realized that the sound was coming from downstairs.

838
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,340
I peered over the banister, and...

839
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,000
I found you crying alone.

840
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,810
I knew I had to go to you.

841
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,090
I sat next to you, and you put your head

842
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,420
in my lap, and I held you while you cried.

843
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,740
And I didn't know it then, but now looking back,

844
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,890
I realize that that was the night that we fell in love.

845
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,330
That was the night that we realized

846
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,100
how much we needed each other.

847
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,310
And look...

848
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:20,200
I so wish that I could take your dark memories away.

849
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,410
I wish that I could make all of that pain go away,

850
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,640
but I can't.

851
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,850
Okay? But what I do know, what I know,

852
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,300
is that for every bad memory,

853
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,800
there is a good one to get you through it.

854
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,140
Run, Barry, run!

855
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,790
Barry?

856
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,320
I remember...

857
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,090
I remember.

858
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,800
I remember everything.

859
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:01,150
I remember everything!

860
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,720
Now for this fire.

861
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,620
I don't think I can put this fire out alone.

862
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,770
You don't have to.

863
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,920
Yes!

864
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,790
Looks like you remembered how to save the day.

865
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,150
Like riding a bike.

866
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,260
- Your mother's maiden name. - Thompson.

867
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,290
CODIS is an acronym for what?

868
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,650
Combined DNA Index System.

869
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,210
Okay. In the third grade,

870
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,200
you renamed the class hamster to...

871
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,250
Alexander Ham Bell.

872
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,440
I was eight years old.

873
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,120
So you got your memories back.

874
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,610
Now we can all focus our attention on stopping Savitar.

875
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,880
Good luck with that.

876
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,870
Please tell me we're not gonna just let her walk out of here.

877
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,990
Now you want to fight?

878
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,260
We don't want to fight you.

879
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,470
Can't really avoid that now, can we?

880
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,620
Yeah, we can. You can stay here with us.

881
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,850
We're your friends. Your family.

882
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,330
Caitlin, I can fix you.

883
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,770
You already tried.

884
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,380
Well then, I'll try harder.

885
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,730
I don't care what it takes.

886
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,540
I don't care what I have to do.

887
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,110
I swear to you, I will find you a cure.

888
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,860
Caitlin, I love you.

889
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,170
I don't love you, Julian.

890
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,120
I never did.

891
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,230
I never loved any of you.

892
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,860
She's gone?

893
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,530
Yeah.

894
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,420
Maybe too far gone now.

895
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,640
We'll figure out a way to get her back.

896
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,200
Just like we figured out how to get you back.

897
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,730
You sure this is the me you want?

898
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,020
With all the baggage?

899
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,610
Seeing you without the weight of everything that's happened,

900
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:48,090
seeing you happy, like you were before your mother was killed?

901
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,680
Without all of that darkness haunting you,

902
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,580
you were finally free.

903
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,810
It was nice.

904
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,370
I did the same thing months ago.

905
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,890
What do you mean?

906
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,470
That freedom? I had that.

907
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,690
When I was with my mom and dad again in Flashpoint,

908
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,590
and I could've let it stay like that.

909
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,140
I could've let the memories of this timeline fade,

910
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,310
but if I'd done that, I would've lost Joe,

911
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,840
and Cisco, and Wally, and Caitlin, and you.

912
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,740
Pain and darkness- it's a part of me.

913
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,500
You know, I need it to fuel me,

914
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,630
to push me to be a better person,

915
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,040
to be a better hero.

916
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,950
To keep me from ever forgetting who I am.

917
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,930
Now that is the Barry Allen I know and love.

918
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,460
Hey, you guys-- okay!

919
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,780
You guys, you got to come see this.

920
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,490
Y-you got to come see this.

921
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,370
What is that?

922
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,410
This is the Speed Force Bazooka.

923
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:59,410
Good, right?

924
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,790
And that's gonna trap Savitar?

925
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,830
There is a tiny little problem.

926
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,870
- What's that? - It's...

927
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,280
In order to generate enough power

928
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,420
to magnetize Savitar's radial field

929
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,170
and keep him in a state of perpetual stasis--

930
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,870
- Stasis. - Inside the Speed Force,

931
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,420
we need by my calculations--

932
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,320
- By calculations-- - 3.86 terajoules of energy.

933
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,640
I'm guessing that's more energy

934
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,900
than a triple-A battery.

935
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,890
Yes. That's more energy than a sun.

936
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,180
Where we gonna

937
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,710
find something like that?
