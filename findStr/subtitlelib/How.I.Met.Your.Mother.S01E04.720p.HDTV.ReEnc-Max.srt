OLDER TED: Kids, when you're single,
all you're looking for is happily-ever-after,

3
00:00:16,562 --> 00:00:18,918
but only one of your stories
can end that way.

4
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:23,278
The rest end with someone getting hurt.
This is one of those stories.

5
00:00:23,374 --> 00:00:26,586
- And it starts with a shirt.
- A shirt?

6
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:27,989
Just listen.

7
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:29,422
<i>OLDER TED: Because none of this
would have happened...</i>

8
00:00:29,517 --> 00:00:32,599
<i>if it hadn't have been for that shirt.</i>

9
00:00:33,846 --> 00:00:34,992
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)...</i>

10
00:00:35,088 --> 00:00:37,496
- Nice shirt.
- Right? Right?

11
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:40,658
Look at those colors.
Green and brown, together at last.

12
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:44,205
- Hot top, bro. Is it new?
- That's the crazy part.

13
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:47,770
I've had this shirt for, like, six years.
Until this morning, I wasn't into it at all,

14
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:49,967
but now it's like my tastes have changed.

15
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:52,323
- Booger.
- Yes, hello, Barney.

16
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:56,142
Barney's offered me 50 bucks to say
some stupid word on a live news report.

17
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,670
Not some stupid word.'Booger.'

18
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:02,699
- But I'm not doing it. I am a journalist.
- What? Journalist?

19
00:01:02,794 --> 00:01:05,373
You do the little fluff pieces
at the end of the news.

20
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:08,970
Old people, babies, monkeys.
That's not journalism.

21
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:11,389
That's just things in a diaper.

22
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:15,113
For your information,
my boss is about to bump me up...

23
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:19,148
- to the City Hall beat.
- City Hall. Miss Thing!

24
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:22,689
So I'm not gonna jeopardize my promotion
by saying 'booger' for 50 bucks.

25
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:24,249
Of course not.

26
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:28,156
'Cause now you're saying 'nipple'
and it's $100.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,692
(WHISPERING) Step into my web.

28
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:34,180
Whose bourbon is this?

29
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:37,459
I don't know.
It was here when we sat down.

30
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:40,164
The point is, I seem to like bourbon now.

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,851
I could have sworn I hated bourbon.

32
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:43,856
First the shirt, now bourbon.

33
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:46,562
I spent 27 years making up my mind
about things, right?

34
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:48,249
The movie I saw once and hated,

35
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:51,050
the city I'll never go back to
'cause it was raining the day I visited.

36
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,819
Maybe it's time to start forming
some second impressions.

37
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:56,302
<i>You're finally gonna watch Goonies again.</i>

38
00:01:56,398 --> 00:01:58,306
'Sloth love Chunk.'

39
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:01,417
<i>Not Goonies. Girls.</i>

40
00:02:01,523 --> 00:02:02,987
What if there's someone from my past...

41
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:05,056
who I thought was wrong for me
at the time,

42
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:09,067
when, in fact, she, like this shirt,
is actually a perfect fit?

43
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,758
Hold up. There are only two reasons
to ever date a girl you've already dated.

44
00:02:12,854 --> 00:02:14,762
Breast implants.

45
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,897
This isn't a bad idea.

46
00:02:16,992 --> 00:02:19,668
Let's think. Ted's greatest hits.

47
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:23,354
- What about that girl, Steph?
- Steph.

48
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,162
Okay, this is difficult to say.

49
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:29,026
Back when I lived in LA,
I was pretty broke,

50
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,486
so I spent a month making adult films.

51
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:37,076
Wow! Okay. How many did you make?

52
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,178
175.

53
00:02:41,048 --> 00:02:44,773
Say what you will about the porn industry,
they're hard workers.

54
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:47,440
What about that chick, Jackie?

55
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:51,426
...and my bathing suit
had fallen completely off.

56
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:54,163
I know the feeling. Once, when I was 16,

57
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,502
I was driving and I hit this hitchhiker.

58
00:02:57,537 --> 00:03:01,591
Don't know what happened to him.
Just kept driving.

59
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,317
No.

60
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:06,344
What about Natalie?

61
00:03:07,086 --> 00:03:09,246
- Natalie!
- Natalie!

62
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:10,810
Who's Natalie?

63
00:03:10,906 --> 00:03:14,393
<i>Natalie. I had so many
fond memories of her.</i>

64
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:17,145
<i>The tea candles on her dresser.</i>

65
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,341
<i>The sock monkey collection on her bed.</i>

66
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:22,874
<i>That one Belle and Sebastian song
she always listened to.</i>

67
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,878
<i>Her smile.</i>

68
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:27,744
Man, I haven't seen her in,
like, three years.

69
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,954
Well, why did you guys break up?

70
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:30,800
I just wasn't looking
for a big commitment at the time.

71
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:33,060
Course, now a big commitment
doesn't seem so bad.

72
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:35,288
Maybe I should call her.
What do you guys think?

73
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:37,793
You dumped a porn star?

74
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:40,859
Friendship over.

75
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:43,082
Friendship over!

76
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:45,698
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

77
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:48,690
Come in. All right, get back to me then.

78
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:51,300
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams?
- Yes, I did.

79
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:55,056
I need you to cover a story.
It's down at City Hall.

80
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:58,038
City Hall? Oh, my God.

81
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:02,122
So next time you're passing City Hall,

82
00:04:02,218 --> 00:04:05,337
make sure and stop by
New York's oldest hot dog cart.

83
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:08,266
Today, a delicious hot dog
will cost you $2.50,

84
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:11,671
but back when the stand
first opened in 1955,

85
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:13,964
you could get one for only a nipple.

86
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:17,870
Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky,
Metro News 1.

87
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:20,808
I said 'nipple' on the news.
That was so unprofessional.

88
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,780
I said 'nipple' on the news.

89
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:25,582
At least it's better than 'booger.'

90
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:27,586
Booger.

91
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,800
There she is.

92
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:35,895
Hey, is it cold in here?
'Cause I can kind of see Robin's nickels.

93
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,059
Now, for your next challenge.

94
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:41,243
There is not going to be another challenge.
I don't care how much you offer me.

95
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:43,627
Oh, search your soul, Robin.

96
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:45,539
You and I both know
this wasn't about the money.

97
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,118
Sure, Metro News 1 pays you jack.

98
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:52,988
And, hey, a little green salad on the side
is good for you, me, and Mr. McGee.

99
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,057
Seriously, who taIks like that?

100
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:58,176
What baby really likes
is the thrill of pulling one over...

101
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:01,010
on those bean counters
who under-appreciate you...

102
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:03,110
and still haven't promoted you.

103
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:07,185
And, so, for two more hundy-sticks,
baby's gonna look in the camera...

104
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,188
and say this.

105
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:11,862
(EXCLAIMS)

106
00:05:11,927 --> 00:05:13,835
I'm just assuming.

107
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,959
I gotta get back to work.

108
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,944
- See you.
- Bye.

109
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,310
Baby's gonna think about it.

110
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,138
Found it. I found Natalie's number.

111
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:28,734
Hey, Ted, nice shirt.
Is it yesterday already?

112
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,912
Thank you.

113
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:34,750
I am calling her. This is crazy.
I haven't taIked to her in, like, three years.

114
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:36,405
I wonder if she even remembers me.

115
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,408
(TELEPHONE RINGING)...

116
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,115
- Hello?
- Natalie.

117
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,962
- It's Ted Mosby.
- Go to hell!

118
00:05:47,737 --> 00:05:49,645
She remembers me.

119
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:57,013
- Why would Natalie hang up on you?
- I don't know.

120
00:05:57,109 --> 00:05:59,465
- Did you sleep with her sister?
- No.

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,470
- Did you sleep with her mom?
- No.

122
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:04,323
I'm losing interest in your story.

123
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:07,836
Well, you must have done something.
Why did you guys break up?

124
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:10,607
He wasn't ready for a commitment.

125
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:15,348
And her birthday
might have been coming up.

126
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,449
Okay, so I didn't want to get
a boyfriend-level gift...

127
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:19,295
for a girl I was just about to break up with.

128
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,364
So you dumped her
right before her birthday?

129
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,271
No! I didn't dump her
right before her birthday.

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,783
Natalie! Hey, happy birthday!

131
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:33,173
Listen...

132
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,229
Never break up with a girl on her birthday!

133
00:06:36,324 --> 00:06:39,953
Lily, please! The shirt!
I know! It was a mistake.

134
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:43,009
- Well, did she cry her eyes out?
- I don't know.

135
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:45,012
How do you not...

136
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:47,497
You didn't.

137
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:50,100
Natalie! Hey, happy birthday!

138
00:06:51,603 --> 00:06:53,511
Listen,

139
00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:56,346
you're awesome.

140
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:59,079
You really are awesome.

141
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,535
I'm just, like, super busy right now,

142
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,223
so maybe we should just call it a day.

143
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:08,958
But you're awesome.

144
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,376
- On her answering machine!
- Okay.

145
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,733
- And on her birthday!
- Lily, come on.

146
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,629
Who breaks up with somebody
on their answering machine...

147
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:20,049
- on their birthday?
- Yeah, dude, e-mail.

148
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,409
Not exactly the point
I was trying to make, Marshall.

149
00:07:23,504 --> 00:07:25,700
That is a terrible way
to break up with someone.

150
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:27,483
Okay, in my client's defense,

151
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,348
is there an un-terrible way to break up
with somebody? No.

152
00:07:30,443 --> 00:07:33,022
Personally, I'd rather hear the bad news
on an answering machine...

153
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:36,587
than face the humiliation in person.
It's the least painful way you can do it.

154
00:07:36,682 --> 00:07:38,719
- Who are you calling?
- Hi, Marshall, it's Lily.

155
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:40,852
We're not gonna have sex
for at least a month,

156
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:43,705
but you're awesome. Okay, bye-bye.

157
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:46,963
No, that was a big mistake, Ted.
You should have done it in person.

158
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,078
Thank you.

159
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:51,984
Desperate, please-don't-leave-me sex
is amazing.

160
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:55,876
Okay, it was childish and stupid.
I just... I didn't want to see her cry.

161
00:07:55,972 --> 00:07:58,294
Well, guess what? She cried.

162
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,970
You just didn't have the sack
to face those tears.

163
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,561
That was me then, okay?

164
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,712
This is the new, old-shirt-wearing,
sack-having Ted.

165
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:07,526
- I'm gonna make this right.
- You know what else?

166
00:08:07,622 --> 00:08:10,582
'My younger sister just got married
and I'm about to turn 30' sex.

167
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:12,585
Fantastic!

168
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:17,235
An occasion that was supposed
to be joyous suddenly turned tragic...

169

- My knee!</i>

334
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,749
No, Marshall.
That was beyond my wildest dreams.

335
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:10,546
So if you ever come to Alabama,

336
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,282
my mom throws these huge crawfish boils,

337
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:15,638
and she's just dying
to meet you, by the way.

338
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,357
Look, Natalie,
there's something I have to say,

339
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,209
and there's no good way to say it.

340
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:22,289
I wanna break up.

341
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,251
I don't think you're the one for me.

342
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:29,071
I don't wanna waste your time,
because I really like you.

343
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,396
I wanna do right by you,
and I think the best way for me to do that...

344
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:35,443
is just to be honest. I'm sorry.

345
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:40,734
Just let it out.

346
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:43,312
They're only tears.

347
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:47,580
(GRUNTS)

348
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:49,672
I'm not the one for you!

349
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:52,450
I'm sorry. I just... I thought
the mature thing to do would be...

350
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:54,837
- It's my birthday.
- Yes, I know. I didn't realize that it was...

351
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:58,275
It's my birthday, and you're telling me
I'm not the one for you?

352
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:01,076
It's really not such a big deal.
I mean, it's the odds.

353
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:03,208
It's like you lost the lottery.

354
00:18:03,304 --> 00:18:05,055
Oh, so dating you is like
winning the lottery?

355
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:09,384
- No, no, no. I didn't mean that.
- Okay, so what's the problem?

356
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,548
- I can't explain it.
- Try.

357
00:18:11,643 --> 00:18:15,333
- It's ineffable.
- I'm not F-able?

358
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:19,634
No, no, no, no, ineffable.
'Ineffable' means it can't be explained.

359
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,989
- Oh, so I'm stupid?
- Oh, God, what's going on?

360
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:25,140
Okay, what's going on is
you broke my heart...

361
00:18:25,236 --> 00:18:28,196
over my answering machine,
on my birthday,

362
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,806
waited three years for me to get over you,

363
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,003
tracked me down,
begged me to go out with you again,

364
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:36,154
only so you could dump me
three weeks later,

365
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,246
again on my birthday!

366
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,992
No, it's not like that. I'm just...

367
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:42,934
- (STAMMERING) It's...
- What?

368
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,029
I'm just, like, super busy right now.

369
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:47,994
<i>OLDER TED: Remember
when Natalie said...</i>

370
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,732
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.

371
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:53,533
<i>Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga.</i>

372
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:57,481
<i>It's a form of guerrilla street-fighting
developed by the Israeli army.</i>

373
00:18:57,576 --> 00:18:59,484
(GRUNTING)

374
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:01,634
This is compliments
of those two gentlemen at the bar.

375
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,247
This is compliments
of those two gentlemen at the bar.

376
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:09,119
- 'My knee!'
- 'It's in my hair!'

377
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:15,040
But isn't it nice to know
people are watching?

378
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,739
- Oh, my God! Are you all right?
- What happened to you?

379
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,040
Told the truth.

380
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:26,191
Turns out the truth has
a mean roundhouse kick.

381
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:27,869
Oh, man.

382
00:19:27,964 --> 00:19:30,543
Oh, well, you did the right thing.
I'm proud of you.

383
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,453
I'm bleeding internally.

384
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,491
Hey, Ted, you know what always
picks me up when I'm down?

385
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:37,004
Other people's misfortune.
You missed something so amazing.

386
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,997
Please, can we just have one person
in this whole bar who didn't see it?

387
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:41,843
Fine.

388
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:43,593
Are you okay?

389
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:46,267
I really thought I was doing it
the good way this time.

390
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,113
I guess there is no good way.

391
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:50,724
Sometimes, no matter how hard
you try to do the right thing,

392
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,862
you just end up flat on your back,
flailing around in a big pile of horse crap.

393
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:58,204
- You saw it?
- My phone gets the Internet now.

394
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,955
(BARNEY LAUGHING)

395
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,958
It's okay.

396
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,475
<i>And that's how it ended with Natalie.</i>

397
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,244
<i>No happily-ever-after.
Just a whole lot of hurt.</i>

398
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,968
<i>And, just like that, all those
wonderful memories were replaced...</i>

399
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:12,305
<i>by this one.</i>

400
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,284
<i>But, you know, bad as that night was,
within a year Natalie was married.</i>

401
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:18,703
<i>And now she has three beautiful children.</i>

402
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,350
<i>So that's the upside of hurt.
Sometimes it happens for a reason.</i>

403
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:25,353
Wow.

404
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:27,679
So you got beat up by a girl?

405
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,971
Is that all you're taking away
from this story?

406
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:32,443
You got beat up by a girl.

407
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,005
Hey, she knew Krav Maga.
