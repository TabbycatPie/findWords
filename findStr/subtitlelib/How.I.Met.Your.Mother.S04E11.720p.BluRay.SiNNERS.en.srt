1
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:03,840
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

2
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:05,573
It's freezing out there. Where's your coat?

3
00:00:05,681 --> 00:00:09,377
Ted, I'm Canadian. I don't need a coat.
This kind of weather is nothing for me.

4
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:11,816
Yeah. This is like a spring day
back in Minnesota,

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,412
if it weren't for all the taxis
and the skyscrapers and non-white people.

6
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:16,990
There aren't any black people
in Minnesota?

7
00:00:17,091 --> 00:00:19,082
Not if Prince is on tour.

8
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:35,102
Well, my sister's plane got in an hour ago,

9
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:39,303
or as a meteorologist might say,
"Hurricane Heather has just made landfall. "

10
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:41,345
Come on. She's not that bad.

11
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:43,436
Here's the back of Heather's baseball card.

12
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:46,039
It took her six years to graduate
from three different colleges,

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,916
during which time she wrecked two cars,
got married for five days,

14
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:51,419
and lived in a tree for nine weeks,

15
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:54,012
only to realize that no one had
any intention of cutting it down.

16
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,892
And now,
Heather says she's moving to New York.

17
00:00:57,994 --> 00:01:00,757
- Wow, that's big news.
- She's never gonna go through with it.

18
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:03,627
Remember a few years back when
she talked about transferring to NYU?

19
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:06,098
And then,
on the day of the admissions interview...

20
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:10,032
Heather? Where's my couch and my TV?

21
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:14,532
I sold them for Nine Inch Nails tickets.

22
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,133
The TV alone is worth two grand.

23
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,636
Well, a last-minute plane ticket
is expensive.

24
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,412
- Wait. Where are you?
- Somewhere in Spain.

25
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,118
Oh! Gotta go. Slow song.

26
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:34,950
- Oh, crap. It's Barney.
- So?

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,585
For all the years
Heather's been visiting New York,

28
00:01:37,696 --> 00:01:40,688
- Ted's never let Barney meet her.
- And I never will.

29
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,427
Every year when the Mosby family
Christmas card shows up...

30
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:47,297
<i>Pulling down her pants</i>

31
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:49,702
<i>Yanking off my own</i>

32
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:53,207
<i>Underneath the mistletoe
I'll make your sister moan</i>

33
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:56,745
<i>Oh! Heather's hot, Heather's hot
We'll go all the way...</i>

34
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,513
<i>I wish I could see her naked
I wish I could see her naked</i>

35
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:03,676
<i>I wish I could see her naked</i>

36
00:02:03,785 --> 00:02:05,776
<i>And down on all fours</i>

37
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:10,485
<i>Ted has a little sister
Gets hotter every day</i>

38
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:13,185
<i>And if I ever meet her
with her boobies I will play</i>

39
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:16,024
<i>Everybody! Sister, sister, sister, I...</i>

40
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,421
What? I can celebrate Hanukkah, too.

41
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:23,530
It's him again. I should probably get it.

42
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,037
<i>- Hey, Barney.
Hey. What's on tap for tonight?</i>

43
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:29,301
Oh, we're heading over to Marshall and
Lily's for a Kathy Bates movie marathon,

44
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,706
<i>but not Misery. You want to join us?</i>

45
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:33,442
Oh! He hung up.

46
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,243
- Hey.
- Hey.

47
00:02:38,716 --> 00:02:41,310
- Hey.
- Hey. Great to see you.

48
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:43,387
Hey, kiddo. You look great.

49
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:46,786
- How are things back home?
- Well, I moved into your old room.

50
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,948
Did you know that you can see

51
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:50,083
straight into Mrs. Gottwald's bedroom
across the street?

52
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:52,923
Oh, yes. I am aware of that.

53
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,327
- How's she looking?
- Ted, she's 62.

54
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:58,229
- Answer the question.
- Surprisingly perky.

55
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,468
Mmm.

56
00:03:00,469 --> 00:03:04,427
Man, it is cold out there.
Why, hello.

57
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,873
I've been waiting for you.

58
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:13,942
Wait a second. That's not our chair.
Did you bring that chair yourself?

59
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,175
I needed one that swivels.

60
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,376
Heather Mosby.

61
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:23,516
Barney. Stinson.

62
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,861
How did you even know
Heather was coming into town?

63
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,767
Never tell me anything.

64
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:39,563
You know I can't keep secrets
around Christmas.

65
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,865
Robin's giving you an iPod.

66
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,532
Ted, can I chat with you for a sec
in the kitchen?

67
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,237
No one touch the chair. It's a rental.

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,072
I can't believe you've been hiding
your sister from me all these years.

69
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:55,673
Do you blame me?
You're like Weird Al Yankovic

70
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:59,515
if he only wrote Christmas songs
about banging my sister.

71
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:02,722
Okay. First of all, I'm flattered.

72
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,922
Secondly, they're just jokes.
A bro can joke about another bro's sister.

73
00:04:08,029 --> 00:04:10,429
It doesn't mean I'm ever gonna act on it.

74
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:12,624
Look, I love my sister,
and as her older brother,

75
00:04:12,734 --> 00:04:15,463
it's my job to protect her
from guys like you.

76
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,868
- You don't trust me, do you?
- No. And I don't trust her, either.

77
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:20,337
Fine. Great.

78
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:23,908
I guess I'll just take my chair and go.

79
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:31,073
Wait. Stop. Come back.

80
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:36,417
Lily and I are taking Heather out for dinner
on Sunday. Do you want to come?

81
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:38,546
I already called Hurley's
and added a fourth.

82
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:41,453
- You really can't tell Lily anything. Jeez.
- No, you can't tell her a thing.

83
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:43,150
<i>That year, the holidays</i>

84
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,251
<i>were really making
Aunt Robin miss Canada,</i>

85
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,920
<i>so Marshall brought her
to the spot he went</i>

86
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,795
<i>whenever he got homesick for Minnesota.
The Walleye Saloon.</i>

87
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,060
Evening, everybody.

88
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,499
- Marshall!
- Marshall!

89
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:54,627
Meet Robin.

90
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:55,795
- Robin!
- Robin!

91
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:57,030
Go back to drinking.

92
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,834
- Drinking!
- Drinking!

93
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:01,801
- What's up, Marshall?
- Hey, what's up... Whoa, Bud!

94
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,936
- What's with the hitch in your giddyup?
- I was playing some hockey today.

95
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:07,172
- Tore up something in my knee.
- Did you go to the hospital?

96
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:10,079
Nah. I just poured some beer on it.
Can't miss the Vikes game.

97
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,051
- Twin Cities!
- Oh, yeah!

98
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:19,925
I love the guys here. They're real men.
No hair products or manicures.

99
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:24,462
- All New York guys are like 10% girl.
- Well, come on. That seems a little unfair.

100
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:28,028
<i>I'll have the vichyssoise
with just a soupçon of crème fraîche.</i>

101
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:30,601
Too much dairy and I tend to bloat.

102
00:05:31,637 --> 00:05:34,935
So, I found an apartment today.

103
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,267
- Really?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:37,966
And I was hoping you'd have

105
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:41,669
a little more wine in you
before I asked you this, but...

106
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:44,410
I need you to co-sign the lease.

107
00:05:45,148 --> 00:05:46,115
Hmm.

108
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,715
Let me think about it.

109
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:51,116
That means
he's not going to do it.

110
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:54,051
I could really use your help on this.

111
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:57,990
- Let's talk about this later, okay?
- Don't hold your breath.

112
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,825
What is it? You don't trust me?

113
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,525
- You're my sister.
- Now he's just stating a fact.

114
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:10,225
Look, Ted, I am serious
about a career in finance,

115
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:13,135
but you just keep looking at me
like I'm a 4-year-old

116
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,935
who says she wants to be an astronaut.

117
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,303
I just don't think you have any idea

118
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,276
how tough it is to make it in New York.

119
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,868
Exactly. You need connections.

120
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,279
If only Ted knew someone
who worked at, say,

121
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,545
Goliath National Bank, then... Wait.

122
00:06:27,886 --> 00:06:28,944
What?

123
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:33,548
I work at Goliath National Bank.
How about that?

124
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,785
All right.

125
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:40,330
We got two Bemidji Pale Ales
and, who ordered the mini-burgers?

126
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,023
- Me.
- All right.

127
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,400
Nice.

128
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,863
- Oh, my God. Is that Fisherman's Quest?
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:52,100
- I used to play FQ all the time back home!
- Oh, yeah? I kind of have high score.

130
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:57,042
Not to brag,
but I caught a 35-inch northern pike.

131
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:00,513
The biggest video fish
anyone's ever reeled in.

132
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:02,378
I mean, freshwater.

133
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:06,278
A tip of the angler's cap, my friend.

134
00:07:06,854 --> 00:07:09,117
Thank you for bringing me here.

135
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:11,881
Those are mine.

136
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:17,720
This is not a good idea.
Heather and Barney, alone in his office?

137
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,889
And I certainly don't want
to be on the hook for her lease.

138
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:23,025
She is growing up.
You just can't see it yet.

139
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,127
We're talking about a girl who was busted
for shoplifting eight months ago.

140
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,833
Ted, a lot of women
go through a shoplifting phase.

141
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,137
And sure, maybe to this day,

142
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,336
they swipe the occasional smaller item

143
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:39,643
because it turns them on in a weird way
that they can't quite explain.

144
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,311
But, if it'll make you feel better,
I'll tag along to GNB tomorrow.

145
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,320
I'll say I'm having lunch with Marshall,

146
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:49,550
but actually,
I'll be spying on her and Barney.

147
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,525
Okay. Okay, I'm good with that.

148
00:07:53,828 --> 00:07:56,763
Heather!
Heather, good luck tomorrow at GNB.

149
00:07:56,865 --> 00:08:00,096
- I'm sure you'll knock them dead.
- And I'll be spying on you guys.

150
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,428
Damn it!

151
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:08,370
"I'm drinking till I forget the
1999 NFC Championship"?

152
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:10,072
That game.

153
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,835
The Vikings were two minutes away
from going to the Super Bowl,

154
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:16,143
when our kicker, who hadn't missed
all year, shanked a field goal,

155
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:18,444
and we lost in overtime. Damn!

156
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:20,675
'99 NFC championship game?

157
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:22,185
- Yeah.
- Damn!

158
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:26,214
My dad,
who I'd never seen cry my whole life,

159
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:27,951
wiped away a tear.

160
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:31,887
He said, "A little part of me just died, son. "

161
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:37,089
Wow. I love how intense you guys are
about your Vikings.

162
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,792
<i>It's like when we watch
Hockey Night in Canada, when we...</i>

163
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:42,997
What?

164
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:47,667
Don't let anyone in here know
that you're not from Minnesota.

165
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:49,266
Why? What are they gonna do
if they find out I'm from...

166
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,743
Does this look like a Dallas bar to you, pal?

167
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:56,408
It's weird, but there's something
comforting about being carried like this.

168
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:01,380
- See you later, buddy!
- Right?

169
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:06,687
Man, can you believe that guy?
So, Robin, where are you from?

170
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:09,495
Uh...

171
00:09:11,465 --> 00:09:15,025
Bemidji. Bemidji, Minnesota.

172
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:17,894
- Go Vikes!
Yeah!

173
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,738
<i>Kids, for what happened next,
I'm gonna jump ahead a couple days.</i>

174
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,674
- Wow! That is a pretty sweet briefcase.
- Hmm.

175
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:28,075
That's a pretty sweet
security camera, too.

176
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:30,612
Oh, and there's another one. And a guard.

177
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:35,413
- I'm planning on paying for it, Ted.
- Yeah. Well, you don't have the job yet.

178
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,919
That door's a push, not a pull.
There you go.

179
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:42,184
Hey, thanks again
for keeping an eye on her yesterday.

180
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:45,089
Look, maybe I was wrong. She sounds
like she handled Barney just fine.

181
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:46,854
Maybe she'll be able to handle New York.

182
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,657
No thanks necessary!

183
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:51,522
- Why not?
- I have a secret.

184
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,761
No, I don't. Nothing happened.
Something happened.

185
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,860
- What happened?
- Nothing.

186
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,429
After Heather's interview, I went to say hi
to Marshall for a few minutes,

187
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,875
<i>and when I came back...</i>

188
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:05,202
Oh, my God!

189
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:09,338
Lily, Lily, before you say or do anything,
I beg you one favor.

190
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:11,747
- What?
- Get off that. It's Prada.

191
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:17,018
- I am so sorry.
- I knew it. I knew it all along.

192
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:20,057
She is still the same irresponsible
train wreck that she always was,

193
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,649
- and when I see Barney...
- You won't say a word.

194
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,024
Ted, Heather begged me not to tell you.

195
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,155
She will hate my guts
if she knows that I blabbed.

196
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:33,897
Oh, I love that briefcase,
but I can't afford it. You were right, Ted.

197
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:38,739
- I certainly was.
- See? She didn't get the briefcase.

198
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:40,399
That's responsible.

199
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:44,001
And there's almost no way
she had sex with anyone in there.

200
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:46,274
Turning over a new leaf.

201
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,913
Evening, everybody!

202
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:56,422
So my dad and I are at
the '99 NFC championship game.

203
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,919
I say evening, everybody.

204
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,017
And when we missed that field goal
and lost...

205
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,063
- Damn!
- Damn! Damn.

206
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,659
My dad,
who I had never seen cry in my entire life,

207
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,896
wiped away a tear and said,

208
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,369
- "A little part of me just died, son. "
- Son?

209
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,677
Oh!

210
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:26,480
I told it the way I'm gonna tell my son.
If I'm ever lucky enough to have a son,

211
00:11:26,584 --> 00:11:30,987
and name him Rashad Tarkenton.

212
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:35,087
- Robin, great story.
- Great story!

213
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:41,328
- But it does sound a little bit familiar.
- I know. They totally ate it up.

214
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,421
- I see what you're doing here.
- What?

215
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:48,299
I brought you here as a favor
because I felt sorry for you, okay?

216
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,836
And now it's like
you're trying to steal my bar.

217
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:53,998
You think I'm trying to steal your bar?

218
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:57,669
- Get out.
- "Get oot"? What, are you Canadian?

219
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:00,268
- No, I...
- You want to impersonate a Canadian,

220
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,642
just turn off the lights

221
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:03,978
and get all scared!

222
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:10,387
- What was that?
- Well, with Canada right across the border,

223
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:13,481
we Minnesotans sometimes
like to make jokes at your guys' expense,

224
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:15,617
and they're all
sort of along the same theme.

225
00:12:15,728 --> 00:12:19,356
- That we're afraid of the dark?
- Yeah. For example.

226
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:23,730
Hey, everyone, how many Canadians
does it take to change a light bulb?

227
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:27,162
"What? Oh, no, the light bulb's out?
I'm scared!"

228
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:32,637
That is insane. Why do you think
that Canadians are afraid of the dark?

229
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:34,676
Well, where does any prejudice
come from, Robin?

230
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:37,712
A stereotype starts,
then all of a sudden it spreads like wildfire.

231
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:40,145
Like Asians can't drive,
Scotsmen are cheap,

232
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:42,739
Brazilians always put on
way too much postage.

233
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:45,081
I just don't think
this is gonna work out, Robin.

234
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:48,748
You can't be hanging out with people
who belittle your beloved homeland,

235
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:52,986
- so I'll walk you out.
- No, wait, I have something to say.

236
00:12:54,728 --> 00:12:56,389
Hey, everybody.

237
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:59,159
Let me tell you something
about people from Canada.

238
00:12:59,266 --> 00:13:01,995
- Hey, Robin, please don't make a scene.
- Shh!

239
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:05,695
Do you know why Canadians
never get a birthday wish?

240
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:08,273
Because they're too afraid
to blow out the candles.

241
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:13,437
Oh, God, I love it here. God.

242
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:17,909
I think your prospects at GNB are good.

243
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:20,643
You've certainly made it clear
you're willing to take any position.

244
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:24,312
- Are these new coasters?
- Well, I hope you get the job.

245
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:27,652
Nothing gives me more pleasure
than filling an opening.

246
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:29,918
I swear to God these coasters are thicker.

247
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:33,655
- Well, I am willing to bend over backwards.
- Okay, that's it.

248
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:36,663
I cannot believe
you had sex with my sister.

249
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:39,397
- You blabbed?
- Do you know what?

250
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:42,595
This is a new batch of the old coasters.

251
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,569
I'm just gonna confirm that
with the bartender.

252
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:47,004
And you,
you're mature and responsible now?

253
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:50,635
Is it mature and responsible to go to your
first big job interview in New York City

254
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:52,735
and nail a total stranger?

255
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:54,473
You've always been
immature and irresponsible.

256
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,742
You will always be
immature and irresponsible.

257
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,479
And I wouldn't co-sign
a library card for you, let alone a lease.

258
00:14:00,587 --> 00:14:03,214
- Barney and I didn't have sex.
- Save it. Lily saw you.

259
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:04,619
Or did she?

260
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:08,754
<i>You see, Ted, you had so little
faith in Heather and me...</i>

261
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:11,761
<i>We decided to give you
exactly what you expected of us.</i>

262
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:13,990
<i>And I knew
we could count on Lily to blab.</i>

263
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:15,293
Oh, my God.

264
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,663
- What? Why would you do that?
- Because you deserved it.

265
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,169
Ted, you know I'm no saint.

266
00:14:21,272 --> 00:14:25,641
And yes, it's true that time
I drove your mother to the airport...

267
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:28,905
Well, let's just say
there was a very confusing,

268
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:32,413
sexually charged moment
in short-term parking,

269
00:14:32,515 --> 00:14:37,008
but I said I would never go
near your sister, and I meant it.

270
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,381
You should have trusted me.

271
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:42,014
You're so convinced I'm still
some out-of-control teenager,

272
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:44,991
you missed the fact I grew up.

273
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,255
I'm gonna find a hotel.
I'll get my things later.

274
00:14:48,863 --> 00:14:50,421
Merry Christmas.

275
00:14:55,702 --> 00:14:57,636
Your mom and I kissed.

276
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:02,303
Better get a move on. You've got five
seconds to catch two more sturgeon.

277
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:05,137
Hey, we got a possible gill screen.

278
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:08,077
Forget it.
You can't catch two fish with one hook.

279
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,982
No, but I can catch one fish
and use that fish to catch the other one.

280
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:20,147
High score! You beat Marshall!

281
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:25,852
She's Canadian! Robin's Canadian!

282
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:28,726
She's Canadian.

283
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:32,426
She's not from Bemidji and she doesn't
know a darn thing about the Vikings.

284
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:35,163
You're just mad 'cause she got high score.

285
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:39,400
Robin, in the '99 NFC championship game

286
00:15:39,507 --> 00:15:41,372
- when the Vikings lost...
- Damn!

287
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:42,807
Oh, damn!

288
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:47,336
Who was the kicker
who missed the field goal?

289
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,449
Uh...

290
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:52,185
Uh...

291
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:56,413
Rashad Tarkenton.

292
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,786
Gary Anderson.

293
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:06,330
He's now retired.
Owns a fly-fishing business in Canada.

294
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:10,191
Goodbye, Robin.

295
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:22,003
No. You know what?

296
00:16:23,046 --> 00:16:27,881
I'm glad you found out
because I'm proud to be Canadian.

297
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:32,477
We may not have a fancy NFL team
or Prince,

298
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:36,581
but we invented Trivial Pursuit.
You're welcome, Earth!

299
00:16:37,893 --> 00:16:43,353
Plus in Canada, you can go
to an all-nude strip club and order alcohol.

300
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:46,456
That's right.
From Moose Jaw to the Bay of Fundy,

301
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,966
you can suck down a 20-ounce Pilsner

302
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:53,005
while watching some coal miner's
daughter strip down to her pelt.

303
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:54,334
Jealous?

304
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:58,604
In Canada,
people don't care where you're from,

305
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:01,874
as long as you're friendly
and maybe loan them a smoke

306
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,744
or hand over a donut.

307
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,816
I'm proud to be
from the Great White North.

308
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,285
And I wish I was there right now.

309
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,356
And we're not afraid of the dark.

310
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:20,253
I mean, we don't love it, but who does?

311
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:33,231
Merry Christmas.

312
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:36,269
- Ted...
- Look inside.

313
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:42,978
You just... If you push it towards the...
Not down, towards the middle.

314
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,449
- Don't need your help.
- Got it.

315
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:56,855
- You signed the lease.
- Yeah. You know why?

316
00:17:57,864 --> 00:18:01,026
Because you trust me
and think it's a great idea?

317
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:05,092
Because I want to get to know you.
The new you.

318
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:07,198
Thanks.

319
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:13,236
By the way, in your new neighborhood,

320
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:16,835
you really should get
a good solid deadbolt for the door.

321
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:19,745
If you want. To live.

322
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:26,243
Hey.

323
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,754
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

324
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:34,857
I'm so sorry for what happened back there.
I acted like a total jerk.

325
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:38,694
- I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, look, I'm sorry.

326
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,496
That was your place.
I shouldn't have tried to make it mine.

327
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:45,595
It's just every year at the holidays,
I get homesick.

328
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:48,197
And so far,
every year I've had a reason to stay.

329
00:18:48,308 --> 00:18:51,834
A boyfriend, a job, or something.

330
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:55,778
But this year for the first time, I don't.

331
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,214
- Yes, you do.
- What?

332
00:19:00,385 --> 00:19:02,580
We all love you, okay?

333
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:05,183
If you ever moved back to Canada,

334
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,986
we would hop on a plane,
we would track you down,

335
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:11,528
and after Barney dragged us to a few
of those strip clubs you talked about...

336
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:16,833
...we would bring you back right here
where you're supposed to be.

337
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:20,833
It's not New York
without Robin Scherbatsky.

338
00:19:20,937 --> 00:19:22,404
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

339
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:26,700
I just miss it there sometimes.

340
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:31,245
I wish I could blink my eyes and be back
in Canada for an hour, you know?

341
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,981
I was hoping you would say that.

342
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:40,620
<i>Once there was this girl who</i>

343
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,383
<i>Wouldn't go and change
with the girls in the change room</i>

344
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:46,220
How did you find this place?

345
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:49,762
- Feels like home, right?
- There's one way to find out.

346
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,697
Oh!

347
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:54,059
Well, sorry there. Didn't see you.
Are you okay?

348
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,329
- I'm fine.
- Okay, sorry about that.

349
00:19:58,103 --> 00:19:59,661
Have a donut on the house.

350
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:01,296
- Thanks.
- Okay.

351
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:04,270
Okay, you bumped into him,

352
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,242
and he apologized
and gave you a donut on the house?

353
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:09,438
Oh, it's just like home.

354
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:15,448
Sorry! It's gonna be fine! Sorry.

355
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:19,084
- No one likes the dark.
- Mmm-hmm.

356
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:29,857
<i>Next up, from Ontario, Marshall Eriksen.</i>

357
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:32,065
I didn't know you signed up.
What are you gonna sing?

358
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,657
Oh, I think you'll recognize it.

359
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:37,498
<i>That's okay
I'm going to rock your body anyway</i>

360
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:39,630
<i>I'm going to rock your body
till Canada Day</i>

361
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,970
<i>Buddy, you can turn off the screen.
We know the lyrics.</i>

362
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:45,875
<i>- Everybody come and play
- Everybody come and play</i>

363
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:49,881
<i>- Throw every last care away
- Throw every last care away</i>

364
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:54,817
<i>- Let's go to the mall today
- Let's go to the mall today</i>
