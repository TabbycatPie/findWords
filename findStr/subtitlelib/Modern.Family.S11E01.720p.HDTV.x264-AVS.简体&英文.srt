他们怎么还在哭啊
Why are they still crying?

31
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,570
是不是因为他们知道自己是小胖子了
Do you think they know they're chubby?

32
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:43,970
虽然花了不少时间
It took us a while,

33
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,790
但我们终于给孩子取好名字了
but we finally named our babies.

34
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,690
这是"茵素"
This is Poppy,

35
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,560
因为我最喜欢的花就是罂粟花
because that's my favorite flower.

36
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,700
这是乔治
And this is George,

37
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,710
因为他出生时看上去很好奇
because he came out looking curious.

38
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,310
取自歌手博伊·乔治
You know, like Boy George.

39
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,310
{\an8}实际上是出自《好奇猴乔治》

Oh, hey, Portal, answer.

41

嗨  艾丽克斯
Hi, Alex!

42
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,730
我的冰雪女王宝贝怎么样啊
How's my little ice queen?

43
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,220
我上高中时就不喜欢别人叫我冰雪女王
Didn't love being called that in high school,

44
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,230
现在也不喜欢
don't love it now.

45
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,360
你好啊  宝贝  总是有很多人问我
Hey, honey. Um, people keep asking --

46
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,530
能再跟我说说你在做什么吗
tell me again what you're doing?

47
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,190
探测南极大陆地下中微子的存在
Detecting the presence of neutrinos beneath the South Pole.

48
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,300
好吧  打住  我还是继续告诉他们
Yeah, you -- you can stop. I'm just gonna keep telling them

49
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,940
你在搜寻雪怪吧
you're searching for the snow monster.

50
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,820
不是吧  艾丽克斯
Seriously, Alex?

51
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,710
你就不能下楼来跟我们聊吗
You can't come downstairs to talk to us?

52
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,250
我已经离开一个月了
I've been gone for a month.

53
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,420
等等  所以下水道卡着的是我的头发吗
Wait. So, that's my hair in the drain?

54
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,970
宝贝  你那边一切都好吧
Honey, is everything okay?

55
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,480
你看上去有点悲伤
You look a little sad.

56
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,350
不  没有
Oh, no, no.

57
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,560
我是之前有点悲伤  脸被冻住塑形了
I was sad earlier, and my face froze that way.

58
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,780
但我不后悔拒掉
But no regrets about

59
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,890
洛杉矶的科技公司那份轻松的工作
turning down that cushy tech job in L.A.

60
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,530
我是说  没错  我想念比尔了
I mean, yeah, I miss Bill

61
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,100
以及有其他女性同事在周围的安全感
and the safety of other women around,

62
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,400
但外公说得对
but Grandpa was right.

63
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,990
现在正是享受冒险的大好光阴
This is the time of life to have an adventure.

64
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,980
我是不是联系得不是时候
Is this a bad time?

65
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,650
不  不  这已经成为我们的新常态了
Oh, no. No, this is our new normal.

66
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,270
-是啊  -我们就没睡过觉了
- Yeah. ‭ - We never sleep.

67
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,060
我太理解被剥夺睡眠的痛苦了
Well, I know all about sleep deprivation.

68
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,200
这里是极昼  太阳永远不落
The sun never sets here,

69
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,970
-所以我已经好几天没睡过觉了  -好吧  真有趣
- so I've been up for days. - Yeah, that's fun.

70
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,830
-真好  宝贝  -我现在醒着都能做梦
- Really nice, honey. - I dream awake now.

71
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,020
稍等下  海莉
Hang on a second. Haley.

72
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,200
海莉  我知道你铁了心坚持母乳喂养
Haley, I know that you are committed to breastfeeding

73
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,500
信奉这本书
and the book,

74
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,830
但我觉得你是时候考虑使用配方奶粉了
but I think it's time that you considered formula.

75
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,610
那将有助于婴儿的睡眠
It will help the babies sleep,

76
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,060
儿童医生也说那是绝对健康的
and the pediatrician said it is perfectly healthy.

77
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,790
我就是活生生的证据  我从小就是喝奶粉长大的
I'm living proof. I was a formula baby --

78
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,750
-6个月时嘴里牙就长满了  -就是啊
- had a full set of teeth at six months. - Yeah.

79
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,870
但是这书上说...
But the book says --

80
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,160
又是这本书
Uch, the book.

81
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,140
你对我的书有什么意见
What do you have against my book?

82
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,780
这本书名叫《你父母的育儿方式全是错的》
It is called "Your Parents Did Everything Wrong."

83
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,900
古迪医生是个享有盛名的小儿生活指导师
Dr. Goode is a celebrated pediatric life coach.

84
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,780
你能调低一点你身上的消极性吗
And can you tone down the negativity?

85
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,330
第六章说这可能会引起对花生的过敏
Chapter six says that it can cause an allergy to peanuts.

86
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,560
天啊  小孩子都应该有史努比的陪伴长大
Oh, man, no kid should grow up without Snoopy.

87
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,560
{\an8}史努比出自《花生漫画》

88
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,570
听上去像是个疯狂的清晨
Sounds like a crazy morning.

89
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,650
我好怀念这种生活
I miss those.

90
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,870
我的研究搭档英格瓦不会说英语
My research partner, Yngvar, doesn't speak English.

91
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,230
是我吗干的
Is me who did that?

92
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,750
除了他从《凡人琐事》的重播集中学到的台词
Except for what he learned from reruns of "Family Matters."

93
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,660
各位
Guys!

94
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,610
有时候那真的有点烦人
So that can be a little annoying

95
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,530
因为你的研究搭档竟然不会说你的语言
having a research partner not speak your language,

96
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,200
不过我可以学他的语言
but I could also try and learn his language,

97
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,980
我也真的去学了
which I have.

98
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,760
敢吵醒他们  我就杀了你
Wake them, and I kill you.

99
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,560
更像西班牙语一些
‭More Spanish.

100
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,980
如果这是在玩角色扮演
If this is role-playing,

101
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,410
我想扮演"被恶心到的儿子"一角
I'd like to play the part of disgusted son.

102
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,430
我要为我的狗窝公司做个宣传视频
I'm making a promo video for my dog-bed company.

103
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,170
当然了  领衔主演是斯黛拉
And Stella's the star, of course.

104
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,260
今天我们要给它录配音
Today we're recording her voice.

105
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,470
我亲自配西班牙语版本
And I am doing the Spanish version.

106
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,540
导演是谁
Who's directing it?

107
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,770
我不知道  大概是我吧
I don't know. Me, I guess.

108
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,510
这可真让我感到很受伤
Wow, that's a punch in the gut.

109
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,420
怎么了  曼尼  你想来执导吗
Why, Manny? Do you want to direct it?

110
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,190
为什么不行
Why not?

111
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,670
有些最出色的艺术家也是拍广告出身的
Some of our best artists started out making commercials.

112
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,610
我比斯派克·琼斯或吉列尔莫·德尔托罗更出色吗
Am I better than Spike Jonze or Guillermo del Toro?

113
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,680
没有
Nope.

114
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,290
听着  通常我都会编个原因
Listen, normally I would just

115
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,600
说你导不了
cook up some fake reason why you couldn't direct it,

116
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,720
但这个情况下  我有个真正的理由
but in this case, I have a real excuse.

117
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,780
你的前女友雪莉
Your old girlfriend, Sherry,

118
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,580
为斯黛拉配音
is the voice of Stella.

119
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,170
杰  你怎么能这样
Jay, how could you?

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,560
雪莉可是在他提出了要娶她的想法后
After she broke his heart when she got repulsed

121
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,530
被吓跑并伤透了他的心呢
by the idea of getting married to him?

122
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,140
更多的是不知所措  不是吓跑吧
More overwhelmed than repulsed,

123
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,100
我记得是这样
as I remember it.

124
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,380
她已经在我们网站上
She's already on our website

125
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,550
为斯黛拉配音了
as Stella's voice.

126
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,830
现在改变
Changing that now

127
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,690
会让我们的粉丝不好接受
could be jarring for our fans.

128
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,320
就比如他们把我的GPS
Like when they made

129
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,080
变成女版英式口音
my GPS lady British.

130
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,220
我情愿迷路
I'd rather be lost

131
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,190
也不要被一个臭屁鬼导航
than talked down to by a snob!

132
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,070
拜托了  杰
Please, Jay.

133
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,300
我需要证明我已经放下她了
I need to prove to myself that I'm over her,

134
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,340
我可以不受其影响 做得很专业
that I can rise above it and be professional.

135
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,480
好吧  但如果你的感情
Fine, but if your emotions

136
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,890
阻碍了这个作品
get in the way of this production,

137
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,980
你就再没有机会为狗窝做广告
you will never work in dog-bed commercials again.

138
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,890
别担心
Don't worry.

139
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,780
我唯一的热情
My only passion

140
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,310
就是帮你实现你充满创造力的想象
is helping you realize your creative vision.

141
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,260
今天结束前  雪莉就会是我的了
By day's end, Sherry will be mine.

142
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,250
不  我们今天庆祝
Oh, no, which icon's birthday

143
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,470
哪个偶像的生日
are we celebrating today?

144
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,470
劳伦·白考尔
Uh, Lauren Bacall's.

145
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,190
等下我们会在她的墓碑前撒郁金香
We're dropping tulips by her grave later,

146
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,310
但这不是为了她的生日
but that's not what this is.

147
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,390
不  我有些迷途青年学生要来
No, I'm having some at-risk students over.

148
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,540
-你们问为什么  -我不想知道
- Why, you ask? - ‭I'm good.

149
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,170
因为我想和这些孩子建立情感
Well, 'cause I want to bond with these kids.

150
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,820
我想让他们知道
I want them to know that even though

151
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,980
即便整个世界放弃了他们
the rest of the world's given up on them,

152
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,700
我也不会
I haven't.

153
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,650
我不想只做他们的副[坏]校长
I don't want to just be their Vice Principal.

154
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,420
我想做他们的好校长
I want to be their nice principal.

155
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,750
我不敢相信你让此发生
I can't believe you let this happen.

156
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,050
我不知道他会玩文字哏
I didn't know there'd be wordplay.

157
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,940
小卡让我作为助理检察官和他的学生聊聊
Cam asked me to speak to his students as an Assistant DA,

00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,910
就得让他们想要得到你的认可才行
you need to make them want your approval.

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,430
更强硬点
Stronger.

307
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,200
主张要坚决  曼尼尔
Assert yourself, Manuel.

308
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,050
你说的话我一个字都听不清
And I couldn't understand a word you were saying.

309
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,140
嘴里不要像含着卤蛋
Try to get the marbles out of your mouth.

310
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,400
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

311
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,990
好的  你有要求尽管提
Yeah, whatever you need.

312
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,650
没准真能成
Wow, maybe this could work.

313
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,350
反正你都站着了  我肩膀有点僵
While you're up, my shoulders are a little tight.

314
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,470
帮我揉揉好吗
You mind getting in there?

315
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,780
我的双手接近你的颈动脉你还有命吗
I don't think you want my hands that close to your neck.

316
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,360
我邀请你们到我家来
I invite you into my home,

317
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,150
可你们就这样报答我
and this is how you repay me?

318
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,820
我知道你们是怎么想的
Oh, I know what you were thinking.

319
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,510
"他过着帝王般的生活  不差一个小雕塑"
"He'll never miss it. He lives like a king."

320
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,580
我们没偷你的破小丑
We didn't take your stupid clown!

321
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,360
你怎么知道是小丑  苏西
Interesting you know it's a clown, Suzie!

322
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,530
你都说过三次了  卡梅隆
You said it three times, Cameron.

323
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,860
请叫我副校长塔克
It's Vice Principal Tucker!

324
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,260
放尊重点  我可不是你妈的鸡头
Show some respect. I'm not your mom's pimp.

325
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,130
好了  小卡
Okay, Cam.

326
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,930
小卡  我知道你很喜欢小摆件
Cam, I-I know you like your tchotchkes,

327
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,080
但你叫孩子们来不是为了建立情感吗
but aren't these kids here so you can bond?

328
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,450
艾丽克斯  一切还好吗
Hey, Alex. Everything okay?

329
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,250
是的  或许是我小题大做了
Yeah, yeah. I-I'm probably overreacting.

330
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,440
我之前试着和这的一个科学家交朋友
It's just I tried to make friends with one of the scientists,

331
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,920
但我们语言不通
but there's a language gap.

332
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,020
他误会了  吻了我
He misunderstood and kissed me.

333
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,070
所以现在有点尴尬
So it's a little awkward now.

334
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,830
听起来真有趣
Uh-huh, that sounds fun.

335
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,580
什么  才不是
What?! It's not.

336
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,890
我有点想回家
I kind of want to come home,

337
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,430
可我来这让外公那么激动
but Grandpa was so excited about me doing this,

338
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,470
我不想让他失望
and I don't want to disappoint him.

339
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,490
你总让他失望
Hey, you've disappointed him a lot.

340
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,340
那是种什么体验
What was that like?

341
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,570
艾丽克斯  我为此纠结过许多年
Ohh, Alex, I struggled with this for years,

342
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,020
但我终于悟懂了
but I-I finally learned

343
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,430
最重要的事是
that the most important thing is --

344
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,820
艾丽克斯  替我跟圣诞老人打个招呼
Hey, Alex! Say "Hi" to Santa Claus.

345
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,050
-再见  -这是南极不是北极
- Bye! - ‭I'm at the South Po-

346
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,920
好了  我想好要怎么做了
Okay. Alright, I've decided what I'm gonna do.

347
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,130
我要对其中一个孩子发起猛攻
I'm gonna turn the heat up on one of the kids.

348
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,000
那孩子要是凶手就会承认
If they did it, they'll confess.

349
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:14,570
假如不是  真凶
If not, the actual criminal...

350
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,140
就会内疚自首
will feel guilty and step forward.

351
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,880
所以咱整个周六就不干别的了吗
So, this is gonna be our whole Saturday?

352
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,620
好吧
Okay.

353
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,380
买单车干嘛  根本没机会骑
Why-Why did we even buy bikes?

354
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,050
是你偷了他的破小丑  对吗
You took his stupid, little clown, didn't you?

355
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,640
你们这代人如此残缺又愤世嫉俗
I find it sad that your generation

356
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,550
太悲哀了
is so damaged and cynical.

357
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,020
那是几天前的事
It happened a few days ago.

358
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,920
我讨厌那玩意
I hated that thing.

359
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,860
必须处理掉
It had to go.

360
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,540
不然他会凑成一整套收藏
I mean, that's how collections start.

361
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,940
我也不喜欢那个猫咪保温罩
I wasn't crazy about the cat cozy, either.

362
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,300
但我从未想过
But I never intended

363
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,200
小卡会错怪那些可怜孩子之一
for Cam to blame it on one of those poor kids.

364
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,470
我本想让保洁阿姨背这个锅的
I mean, I was just gonna pin it on the cleaning lady.

365
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,810
你把它藏哪了  小白崽子
Where's it at, Wonderbread?!

366
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,680
我不知道你在说什么
Uh, I don't know what you're talking about,

367
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,870
塔克老师  我发誓
Mr. Tucker. I-I swear.

368
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,900
好了好了
Okay. Okay.

369
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,730
我们都喘口气
Let's just, uh -- Let's all take a breath

370
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,870
回想一下基本的法律常识  好吗
and just remember some of the basics of the law, okay?

371
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,130
在被证明有罪之前  我们都是无辜的
We're all innocent until proven guilty.

372
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,890
怎么说我也是个身上带着...
Take it from someone who is packing one of --

373
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,770
见鬼  我把警徽忘在厨房了
oh, dang it. Ooh, I left it in the kitchen.

374
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,010
你们先别动
Okay, stay right there.

375
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,080
-太逊了  我们走  -不行
- This is lame. Let's bounce. - Okay, no.

376
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,060
在我找到小雕像前谁也不准走
No one is bouncing until I get my figurine.

377
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,430
但我必须尽快回家
But I have to get home soon.

378
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,320
我读过你的档案  贝琳达
I've read your file, Belinda.

379
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,460
根本没人在乎你  也不在乎你去哪
No one knows or cares where you are.

380
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,580
喝光
And...

381
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,160
搞定
done!

382
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,170
为什么  为什么
Oh, why?! Why?!

383
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,880
这是怎么回事
What is going on?

384
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,360
宝宝们怎么还醒着
How are they still awake?

385
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,530
我吸尘器也开了  奶粉也喂了
I tried the vacuum. I tried formula.

386
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,730
我什么都试过了
I tried everything.

387
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,620
还有办法
Not quite.

388
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,950
是时候拿出
It is time to break out...

389
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,040
大杀器了
the big guns.

390
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,170
我知道海莉不准用安抚奶嘴
I know Haley banned pacifiers,

391
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:47,800
但我买这些的时候
but I bought these

392
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,730
还以为她会是那种有哏的妈妈
when I thought she was gonna be a fun mom.

393
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,920
来吧
Let's do it.

394
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,650
快看
Look at that.

395
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,000
药到病除
It's working already.

396
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,650
老式育儿胜利了
Old-school parenting for the win.

397
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,750
他们马上就会睡着的
They'll be asleep in no time,

398
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,970
除非看到对方
unless they see each other.

399
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,230
-那就会笑到停不下来了  -是啊
- Then they won't be able to stop laughing. ‭- Yes.

400
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,670
什么情况
What the hell?

401
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,790
奶粉  奶嘴
Formula? Pacifiers?

402
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,090
你们在逗我吗
Are you kidding me?!

403
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,800
这可真是一种清奇的方式来表达"妈妈  谢谢你
This is a very weird way of saying, "Thank you, Mother,

404
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,570
安顿好我的宝宝
for settling down my babies.

405
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,580
我还有很多要向你学习"
I have a lot to learn from you."

406
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,860
我说的你一个字都没听
You ignored everything I asked of you!

407
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,910
海莉  不要对你妈妈这么过分
Haley, don't be so hard on your mom.

408
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,770
还有你
Ohh, you!

409
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,550
这奶嘴一看就是你的风格
Those pacifiers have you written all over them.

410
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,290
宝宝们不该抽烟  反差萌啊
Babies aren't supposed to smoke!

411
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,890
你们怎么能背着我做这种事呢
How could you sneak behind my back like that?

412
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,380
宝贝  我们就是想帮你
Honey, we were just trying to help.

413
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,240
好吧  你没帮上
Well, you didn't.

414
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,460
书里说85%用奶嘴的宝宝
The book says 85% of pacifier users

415
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,070
长大后会变成猫奴
grow up to be cat people.

416
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,150
真不敢相信我会这么说  你真的不能再看书了
I can't believe I'm saying this, but you need to stop reading.

417
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,180
然后呢
And do what?

418
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,410
然后  靠我的母性本能吗
Do what? Rely on my instincts?

419
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,640
我没有本能  这就是问题
I don't have any. That is the problem!

420
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,220
宝贝  每个人都有本能
Honey, everybody has instincts.

421
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,080
是吗  我有吗
Oh, do I?

422
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,820
我一直在等着本能自己发动
Because I keep waiting for them to kick in,

423
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,660
但它没有
and they haven't.

424
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,360
我觉得它永远也不会发动了
And I don't think that they ever will.

425
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,400
我只是  可能我就是不应该成为一个妈妈
I just -- Maybe I'm just not meant to be a mom.

426
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,490
宝贝  你当然可以成为一个妈妈
Sweetie, of course you're meant to be a mom.

427
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,470
听着  感觉到不知所措很正常  真的
Listen, it is normal to feel overwhelmed. Really.

428
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,670
最好的父母都是担心自己做得
It -- The best parents are the ones who worry

429
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,710
不够好的父母
they're doing it wrong.

430
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,410
爱人也一样
Same goes for lovers.

431
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,340
等等  宝宝们还在沙发上吗
Wait, are the babies still on the couch?

432
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,950
他们肯定没事啦
Oh, I'm sure they're fine.

433
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,400
门锁住了  宝宝们这个时候会滚来滚去了
It's locked. Babies start rolling over at this age.

434
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,140
你有钥匙吗
Oh. ‭Do you have a key?

435
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,770
放里面了  不过我很久以前在外面藏了一把
Uh, it's inside, but I hid one out here years ago.

436
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,490
放在
It's in, um...

437
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,770
一块假的石头里
It's in a fake rock.

438
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,980
找不到了
Can't -- Can't find it.

439
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,170
那块石头太真了
It's -- It's too realistic.

440
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,490
我为什么要加钱买逼真的好货
Why did I spring for the good one?

441
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,690
我必须进去
I have to get in there.

442
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,760
海莉  海莉  你要干什么
Haley! Haley, what are you doing?!

443
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,110
宝贝  宝贝  小心
Honey. Honey, be careful.

444
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,860
那个屋顶每爬必摔啊
It's impossible not to fall off of that roof!

445
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,150
茵素  乔治  妈妈来了
Poppy! George! Mommy's coming!

446
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,820
我觉得这看上去很母性本能
Those sure look like mom instincts to me!

447
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,180
你是天生的好妈妈
You're a natural!

448
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,780
现在知道她以前是怎么在宵禁后溜进来的了
Now we know how she used to sneak in after curfew.

449
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,150
也知道今年该让谁来挂圣诞彩灯了
And who's hanging the Christmas lights this year.

450
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,720
-没错了  -宝宝醒了
- Yeah. ‭- Babies are up.

451
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,230
没人去管管吗
Somebody gonna take care of that?

452
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,700
当你躺在斯黛拉的狗床上
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

453
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,300
你会感到被爱环抱
you know you're loved.

454
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,020
有好一点吗
Was that any better?

455
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,540
怎么说呢  怎么说呢
Where to begin, where to begin...

456
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,770
你见过狗  对吧
You've met a dog, right?

457
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,850
是啊
Yes.

458
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,280
而且我知道你以前被爱环抱过
And I know you've felt loved before.

459
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,110
那把这两种思路合在一起  这一次尽量做好
So let's link those two ideas and try to get it this time.

460
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,660
我能先喝点水吗
Can I get some water first?

461
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,690
可以吧
I suppose.

462
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,470
你应该让她从狗盆里喝水
You should make her drink it out of a dog bowl.

463
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,820
那有点过分了  但你说得对
That seems over-the-line, but you were right.

464
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,900
这么做确实有用
This is working.

465
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,180
你好  艾丽克斯  我现在有点忙
Hey, Alex. Kinda in the middle of something.

466
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,260
好吧  就是想告诉你这边的事情
Okay. It's just that things are spiraling

467
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,310
有点不受控制
a little bit down here.

468
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,140
这个叫英格瓦的人  一直送我自己杀掉的东西
This guy, Yngvar, keeps trying to woo me

469
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,340
来讨我欢心
with things he's killed.

470
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,430
又一条鱼  谢谢
Another fish. Thanks.

471
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,790
那我把它跟之前的放一起
I'll...put it with the others.

472
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,980
我们怎么还停在这一步  时间不等人
We're still at this? Meter's running.

473
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,350
准备  开始
And...action.

474
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,220
当你躺在斯黛拉的狗床上
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

475
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,740
你会感到被爱环抱
you know you're loved.

476
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,230
太棒了
Wow.

477
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,030
把她治到服服帖帖了
You have her right where you want her.

478
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,610
现在过去  给她一点赞美
Now, go in there, give her a little praise,

479
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,820
就能把她钓到你身边
and then reel her in.

480
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,040
这不难
It won't be hard.

481
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,340
这是继有一次即兴表演的观众让她扮
This is her best performance

482
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,540
跟她长得像的名人后  她最好的表演了
since that improv audience suggested "Jackee O."

483
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,980
英格瓦确实人挺好的
Yngvar does seem sweet.

484
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,500
我听说这边的自杀率也开始趋于稳定了
I read the suicide rate here has plateaued.

485
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:32,370
行了  可以了  结束了  孩子
Okay, that's enough. Wrap it up, kid.

486
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,170
准备回家吧
Time to go home.

487
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,670
太好了  谢谢你
Oh. Thank you.

488
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,250
这边真的不太行
This has not been working out.

489
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,210
我就是需要你的允许才好说出来
I mean, I just needed your permission to admit it

490
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,570
因为我来这里有一部分原因是为了取悦你
because part of me came down here to impress you.

491
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,530
回见啦  外公  爱你
See you soon, Grandpa. Love you.

492
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,430
怎么样	
So?

493
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,660
非常棒
That was really good.

494
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,830
真是谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

495
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,390
这都是你的功劳
I mean, it's all you.

496
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,610
我从来没有遇到过如此老练的导演
I've never had a director with such a sure hand.

497
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,840
太有魔力了
It's so electric.

498
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,480
可不是嘛
It is, isn't it?

499
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,500
有没有兴趣去喝一杯啊  褐眼帅哥
What do you say we get a drink, Brown Eyes?

500
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,730
踏破铁鞋无觅处
It was all happening.

501
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,530
我离导演神作就只差一步了
I was on the brink of a directorial masterpiece.

502
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,010
这种作品可是能够让我一飞冲入
This was the kind of thing that could launch me

503
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,990
无薪实习的机会呢
straight into an unpaid internship.

504
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,520
这杯东西可以再稍等一会
Let's put a pin in that drink.

505
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,140
我想再试一遍
I wanna go again.

506
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,930
虽然只再重录了63次  但我成功了
It took 63 more takes, but I got it.

507
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,600
当你躺在斯黛拉的狗床上
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

508
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,320
你会感到被爱环抱
you know you're loved.

509
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,890
你是"纯种"好演员  别表现像个小"杂种"
You're a purebred. Stop acting like a mutt.

510
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,750
再来一次
Again!

511
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,680
当你躺在斯黛拉的狗床上
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

512
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,460
你会感到被爱环抱
you know you're loved.

513
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,130
应该还有隐含着痛苦情绪
There's pain behind this.

514
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,090
那些人类不经你同意就把你给绝育了
They spayed you without your permission!

515
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,960
这是你的身体  凭啥别人做决定  再来
It's your body! Who decided?! Again!

516
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,660
当你躺在斯黛拉的狗床上
When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

517
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,360
你会感到被爱环抱
you know you're loved.

518
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,510
-再来一次  -当你躺在斯黛拉的狗床上
- Again! ‭- When you lie down in a Dog Bed by Stella,

519
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,140
你会感到被爱环抱
you know you're loved.

520
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,800
卡  我们很满意
And cut! We're good in here.

521
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,130
你还有什么想尝试的吗
Anything you wanna try?

522
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,610
"试"也不是跟你试
Not with you!

523
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,240
垃圾  这是我正在看着的东西
Garbage. That's what I'm looking at here.

524
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,800
垃圾人类
Human garbage.

525
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,080
对  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

526
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,480
就跟我妈说的一样  我就是个渣滓
It's just like my mom says -- I'm nothin'.

527
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,300
我要加入帮派  去弄个脸部刺青
I'm gonna join a gang, get a face tattoo.

528
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,680
我要卖头发去买毒品
I'm gonna sell my hair for nose drugs.

529
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,030
好了好了  停  我听不下去了
No, okay, stop! I-I can't take it anymore.

530
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,210
对不起  是我把雕像丢掉的
I'm sorry. I threw away the statue.

531
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,680
它...  它真的很土嘛
It was -- It was just so tacky.

532
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,560
各位  拜托你们别自暴自弃好吗
You guys, please don't give up on yourselves, okay?

533
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,870
你们还有大好未来在等着你们
You have very bright futures.

534
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,870
是啊  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

535
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,690
当然有啊  在戏剧界
They sure do... in theater.

536
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,720
因为他们是学校的戏剧俱乐部
Because this is the theater group from school,

537
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,150
引人入胜剧团
The Emotivations!

538
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
棒  表现太棒了
Bravo! Brava!

539
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,190
我那天就在垃圾桶里发现了
I found this in the trash the other day.

540
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,750
我知道你肯定不会承认是你丢的
I knew you put it there and wouldn't admit it.

541
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,390
所以我带了一群才华洋溢的悲剧演员回家
So I brought some very talented young thespians over

542
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,830
来演绎迷途青年
to portray at-risk youth.

543
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,560
他抓到你啦  姐妹
He got you, girl!

544
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,760
我说了我想要跟这帮孩子建立情感
You know, I said I wanted to bond with these kids,

545
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,860
绝对是做到了
and I sure did.

546
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,650
这可是十分硬核的"捆绑"
We had some hard-core bondage.

547
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,180
你绝对会被炒鱿鱼
You're gonna get fired.

548
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,310
我疲惫的一身骨头躺在这床上就舒服了
This bed feels good on my weary bones.

549
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,480
等等
Mmm!

550
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,270
有骨头
Bones.

551
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,820
-我需要经费重拍  -做梦吧
- I'm gonna need money for reshoots. - Not gonna happen.

552
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,680
有时候人生中也要知道何时该投降
Sometimes in life, you've got to know when to call it quits.

553
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,330
投降并不总是简单
It's not always easy.

554
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,810
承认自己的错误需要很大的勇气
It takes a lot of courage to admit your mistakes.

555
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,430
你唯一能做的就是尝试从错误中学习
The only thing you can do is try to learn from them

556
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,170
并继续向前迈进
and keep moving forward.

557
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,460
好啦  直升机很快就要到了
Anyways, the helicopter will be here soon.

558
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,160
我想是时候道别了
So, I guess this is goodbye.

559
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,080
别出去外面等

560
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,770
雪怪是真实存在的

561
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,160
我也会想你的
I'll miss you, too.

562
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,630
你听到了吗
Do you hear that?

563
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,910
世上最美妙的声音就是婴儿不哭的声音
There is no sound better than babies not crying.

564
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,210
我们能睡个爽啦
‭Mm, we're gonna get so much sleep.

565
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,700
又或者...
Or...

566
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,450
又来吗
Again?

567
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,130
我感觉我能表现得更好
I just feel like I could do better.

568
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,470
你表现很可以了
Oh, you were fine.

569
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,510
真的吗
Really? 

570
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,590
太好了
Yes!

571
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,960
晚安
Mm. Good night.

572
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,950
晚安
Good night.

573
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,300
什么  那是什么  那是什么
What?! What is that?! What is it?!

574
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,900
海莉  你在干嘛
Haley! What are you doing?!

575
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,260
我又把自己锁门外了
I locked myself out again.

576
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,490
这下好了  "感谢"你们的大吼大叫啊
Great. Thanks for screaming.

577
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,990
要不...  反正我们醒着也是醒着...
Well... as long as we're both awake...
