1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,680
Remember before when we don't have kids,

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,360
we can just lie in bed on Saturday.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,800
That's how we got them.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,430
Why did I have to be so sexy?

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,860
A few months ago, Luke joined the club soccer team.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,530
And at first, we were thrilled.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,760
But then we realized

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,870
it takes over your whole weekend.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,320
And not in the cool marathon way.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,900
Luke sits on the bench a lot,

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,440
which means we sit in the hot sun for like eight hours

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,350
just to see him play five minutes.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,610
But what a five minutes. Tell'em about last week.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,770
Oh, yeah. Luke stopped a goal with his face.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,790
- Too bad he doesn't remember that. - Yeah.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,690
What if we sent Luke to the game without us today?

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,380
- We can't do that. - Why not?

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,880
Missing one tournament doesn't

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,890
make us bad parents.

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,500
My mom never went to any of my stuff.

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,820
I'm fine.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,240
Why didn't she go to any of your stuff?

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,920
Because she was an incredibly competitive woman

24
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,960
who didn't like to see me do very well at anything,

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,450
but I think it's pretty clear who won.

26
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,740
I'm working now, you know,

27
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,890
and I really need my weekends back

28
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,660
to -- to catch up on errands.

29
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,170
I don't know. It just feels wrong.

30
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,950
Would it feel wrong to use that robot gutter cleaner

31
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,810
that's been sitting in the box for the last three weeks?

32
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,880
No, that would feel right -- so right.

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,610
Did I tell you I call it "The gutter done"?

34
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,210
You did! I love "Gutter done."

35
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,000
It's your sense of humor. It's so fun.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,820
Okay, stop drilling. You struck oil.

37
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,170
But only if Luke's 100% cool with it.

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,910
Yeah, of course. I'm on it.

39
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,100
You know, if we're not going,

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,910
we could stay in bed a little longer.

41
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,320
- No, thank you. - Okay.

42
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,820

YYeTs.com

48
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,560
What are you doing with those swatches?

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,790
She's gonna be here any minute.

50
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,820
I told you to put all this wedding stuff away.

51
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,070
Are these really our top-two choices for color palette?

52
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,170
Why are they both white?

53
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,760
That's what my friend Keisha asks about you and daddy.

54
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,530
Instead of hiding all this stuff,

55
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,410
why don't you just tell Pam we're getting married?

56
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,630
I will, when she's ready.

57
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,580
Carefully and preferably in a large, open field.

58
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,810
She's your sister, not the Hulk.

59
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,360
My big sister, Pam, is emotionally fragile

60
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,290
and she's still single, so when she finds out

61
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,150
I'm getting married before she is --

62
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,880
Look out.

63
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,950
She can be meaner than a barn owl at sunset.

64
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,210
Because that's when they wake up?

65
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,860
Yep. That's morning time for a barn owl.

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,790
- It's her! - Quick! Hide!

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,310
It's okay, Lily. Come on.

68
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,580
Oh, take that bow out of her hair.

69
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,970
I don't want to rub our daughter's adorableness

70
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,070
in my barren sister's face.

71
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,200
- There she is! - Hey, Pam!

72
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,690
Well, the damn airline lost my trunk.

73
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,160
- Now I'm gonna have to make new clothes. - Oh, no.

74
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,140
Yep.

75
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,960
I need to squeeze something.

76
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,110
- Get over here, Lily. - I'm good.

77
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,610
Yeah, well, she's shy.

78
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,930
So, Pam, we've got some big news.

79
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,560
Speaking of big news --

80
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,340
You remember that little ugly girl i used to babysit,

81
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,030
Britney Horner?

82
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,080
- Yeah. - Well, she got married last summer,

83
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,490
and now she's pregnant with twins.

84
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,490
So, if you're keeping track, that's ugly -- 2, me -- nothing.

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,020
What's your news?

86
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,140
Well...

87
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,650
We're getting a new dryer.

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,740
Well, I'm very happy for y'all.

89
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,570
Thank you.

90
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,950
How come I never get a new dryer?

91
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,040
Mom, in all the time you've known grandpa,

92
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,800
has he ever used the word "Fluxions"?

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,380
That is not an f-word I have heard him use.

94
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,040
He's beating me in "Words with friends."

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,130
How is that even possible?

96
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,800
Shouldn't you be playing "Words with friends"

97
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,090
with friends?

98
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,270
Grandpa is my friend.

99
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,650
Of course he is. That's not sad. What?

100
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,690
Morning, buddy. What's with the pillow?

101
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,470
It's for soccer.

102
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,920
My neck gets pretty tired watching all those games.

103
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,230
Right.

104
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,590
Yeah, I'll bet.

105
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,470
Say, listen, your dad and I were just talking

106
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,900
about you maybe wanting to go to the game without us today.

107
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,800
But it's totally up to you.

108
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,020
Whatever you want because we love you very much.

109
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,430
Right. You can either ride with some of your teammates,

110
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,570
like the L.A. Kings,

111
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,640
or you can ride with us,

112
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,660
like how Gloria and grandpa take Joe to playdates.

113
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,050
Professional athlete, little poopy baby --

114
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,890
- Your call. - I'll get a ride with Max.

115
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,360
- Great! - Are you sure it's okay?

116
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,460
Yeah, it's fine.

117
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,830
Hey, can I borrow your sleep mask?

118
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,540
- You bet. - Awesome.

119
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,060
Yes! I love that kid.

120
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,070
Can you imagine how easy it would be

121
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,260
if it was just him?

122
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,260
I mean...

123
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,470
I know what you mean.

124
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,370
You call that folded?

125
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,710
Where's that military precision?

126
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,060
We didn't fold many onesies in the navy.

127
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm back!

128
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,910
What did the doctor say?

129
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,020
He said my eyes are perfect.

130
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,740
Where was he looking when he said it?

131
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,090
Pretty sure Gloria needs glasses.

132
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,310
The last couple of months, she's been struggling.

133
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,410
I'll take this one. It looks very good.

134
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,260
That's their address, Magoo.

135
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,290
Did he even give you an eye test?

136
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,420
He put the spoon in one eye,

137
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,510
the spoon in the other eye,

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,320
The puff puff, the eye drops.

139
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,860
20/20. Now who's the Magoo?

140
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,390
What the hell language was that?

141
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,730
Did you see that fresh coat of nail polish?

142
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,110
She never went to the doctor.

143
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,070
Why would she lie?

144
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,300
She's vain, Manny.

145
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,770
She doesn't want to wear glasses.

146
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,380
Well, she's only hurting herself.

147
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,210
- Okay, I hope you're hungry. - Starving.

148
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,680
That damn airline ran out of roast beef.

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,690
Tried to fast talk me

150
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,210
into eating something called "Hoo-mus."

151
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,140
Oh, hummus -- it's actually really delicious.

152
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,770
You would like tha-- uh. Oh.

153
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,200
- What's this? - Oh, uh, that's an action figure.

154
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,600
It's two grooms.

155
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
They melted together in the car

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,350
on a very, very hot day.

157
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,400
It was 103.

158
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
My daddies are getting married.

159
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,630
Your dads are getting married?

160
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,430
That can't be right.

161
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,180
That's what my friend Keisha says.

162
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,610
Is this true?

163
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,260
Pam, honest to goodness, we were gonna tell you.

164
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,750
Get over here, you!

165
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,570
She's got me.

166
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,150
Well, damn!

167
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,020
This is the greatest news I've ever heard!

168
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,360
Oh, I am so happy to hear you say that, Pam.

169
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,360
Of course. Oh!

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,790
I want my baby brother to be happy.

171
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,230
And as long as we're sharing, I have some news.

172
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,660
You remember Bo Johnson?

173
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,370
Oh, my gosh, how could I forget? Oh!

174
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,090
He was my first crush.

175
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,180
Please tell me nothing happened to his face.

176
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,550
What did he fall into?

177
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,370
He fell into me.

178
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,780
We're engaged!

179
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,220
- Say what? - Bo and I are getting married!

180
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,470
That is fantastic! Cam, isn't this great news?

181
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,520
Come here, you. Oh!

182
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,290
Yeah. So great.

183
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,860
Get in on this! Come on!

184
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,120
Thank you for jumping.

185
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,340
I didn't feel guilty for missing Luke's soccer tournament

186
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,130
because I had a ton of errands

187
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,350
I figured would take me all day to finish.

188
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,270
But for some weird reason, I was flying through my list.

189
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,320
I ended up in every short line.

190
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,240
I made every green light.

191
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,750
It was the ultimate karmic bitch-slap.

192
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,170
Because suddenly I had no more errands,

193
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,790
which meant no more excuses,

194
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,130
which meant me at that boring soccer tournament.

195
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,160
Hi. There you are.

196
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,060
Your son is playing so great.

197
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,690
- No, I'm Luke's mom. - No, I know.

198
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,220
- He's been amazing all day. - Luke?

199
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,830
Oh! Luke?

200
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,510
Here, you want one?

201
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,180
Uh, no, thanks. I'm coffeed out.

202
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,450
- Oh, honey, it's sangria. - Well, all right.

203
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,340
Okay, that's it. Grandpa's cheating.

204
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,100
On Gloria?

205
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,600
How could he possibly do better?

206
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,570
No, not on Gloria -- on this game.

207
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,980
I've never lost it to anyone.

208
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,310
Keep playing word games with grandpa,

209
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,520
and you never will.

210
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,670
Hey, girls!

211
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,830
Hey. What is that thing?

212
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,900
What do they call it,

213
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,350
or what should they have called it?

214
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,270
- Never mind. - Uh, wait, wait, wait!

215
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,820
It's a gutter cleaner.

216
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,530
Ladies, I give you the future.

217
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,440
How many times have you girls seen me fall off this ladder?

218
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,240
Now that's gonna happen less.

219
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,620
Looks like your, uh,

220
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,630
gutter cleaner is stuck on something.

221
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,160
Not a problem.

222
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,740
This baby detects blockage and then ramps up the power.

223
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,580
That's why I've nicknamed it "The gutter done."

224
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,680
- Dad! - Stop!

225
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,630
Sorry, it's such a missed opportunity.

226
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,200
Aah! Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!

227
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,960
- What? What happened? - It's a bird's nest!

228
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,810
- No! - And they're all dead!

229
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,040
- Oh, my god! - You killed them!

230
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,320
Honey, it wasn't me!

231
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,000
It was the robot!

232
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,900
Look at it.

233
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,450
It doesn't know!

234
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,920
I'm sorry!

235
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,690
Mom! Mom! Help!

236
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,890
What?! What happened?!

237
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,900
- I just ate a handful of this rat poison. - Why?!

238
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,920
I thought it was trail mix.

239
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,320
Why do I keep it so close together?

240
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,460
I'll call 911!

241
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,410
Here, read the box!

242
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,520
Tell me what it says to do!

243
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,460
Hurry!

244
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,400
- It says... - I don't have much time!

245
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,830
In the...

246
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,610
- And I'm dead. - What?

247
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,350
You'd rather kill your husband

248
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,200
than admit you need glasses.

249
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,210
- Wow, mom. - It's not poison?

250
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,060
Oh, there's rat poison,

251
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,430
and I do keep it dangerously close to the trail mix,

252
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,750
but this was to point out

253
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,420
that your vanity could be fatal.

254
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,920
I knew this was all a trick.

255
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,990
That's why I acted like I couldn't read that box!

256
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,780
How many people have to pretend to die, Gloria?

257
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,620
It just doesn't make any sense.

258
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,120
Pam and Bo Johnson?

259
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,280
- My Bo Johnson? - "My"?

260
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,070
Should it bother me that you're this jealous of an old crush?

261
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,310
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

262
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,440
Bo is straight.

263
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,400
He'd probably never go for me.

264
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,230
Oh, my gosh, it is Bo!

265
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,850
Look, he's hotter than ever.

266
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,390
- I'm gonna answer it. - No, you can't.

267
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,660
Yes, I can. We're practically family.

268
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,400
Hey, dude. It's Cam.

269
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,320
Where?

270
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,340
Been good -- been real, real good.

271
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,690
So, you and Pam, huh?

272
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,890
Hey, better be good to my old sis,

273
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,630
or I'll have to wrestle you down.

274
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,360
- Oh, my God. - Hey, question --

275
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,090
Do you still have that friendship bracelet that I made for you?

276
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,880
Oh, okay.

277
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,080
Yeah, okay, if you're busy, I'll have Pam call you back.

278
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,880
Hey, and, Bo, congratulations.

279
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,970
You too.

280
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,930
- Can you believe it? - Oh, and we're gay again.

281
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,070
It just doesn't make sense.

282
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,040
I mean, he's got to be after our drilling rights.

283
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,130
I knew it.

284
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,480
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

285
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,910
I knew you couldn't stand the thought

286
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,090
of me landing the man of your dreams!

287
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,230
"Dreams" is strong.

288
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,710
Believe it or not, Bo and I are in love.

289
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,270
He thinks I'm beautiful, and he's right.

290
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,960
And for the record, Bo has twice the land we do.

291
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,620
He has absolutely no interest in my drilling rights!

292
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,880
Not that kind, at least.

293
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,800
Okay, let's just relax.

294
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,610
Hey, hey, come on, Pam, do you want to pick me up again?

295
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,670
- They warned me, you know. - Who warned you?

296
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,540
The whole family said you wouldn't take it well.

297
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,180
Ever since you moved to the city

298
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,600
'cause you couldn't hack it on the farm.

299
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,880
- "Couldn't hack it"?  - Yeah, that's right.

300
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,010
Everyone knows, Cam, you're not farm strong.

301
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,740
You take that back, Pameron Jessica Tucker!

302
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,660
I will not! You are weak and weepy.

303
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,530
That's why we can't ever say anything to you

304
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,800
'cause we know you'll crumble into a big heaping mess!

305
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,760
Oh, are you saying I'm the one people have to step around --

306
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,240
that I'm the Pam of the family?

307
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,860
You mean the Cam of the family?!

308
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,440
'cause that's what we all call it!

309
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,090
Okay, that's enough!

310
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,800
That's enough! That's enough!

311
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,540
You know what? Well, I was gammy's favorite!

312
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,690
- That's enough! - Really?

313
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,460
- Yeah! - Come on! Enough!

314
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,050
No!

315
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,780
Seriously -- Pameron?

316
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,090
Oh! Way to go, Luke!

317
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,630
- The kid's amazing. - Amazing.

318
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,080
- So great. - Right? Hello?

319
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,610
- Claire? - Phil?

320
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,020
Oh, hi, honey, I was -- I was just about to call you.

321
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,890
I killed a bunch of baby birds.

322
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,940
- What? - My robot wiped out the nest.

323
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,950
And now the mom's just staring at me.

324
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,970
They recognize faces, you know.

325
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,040
I saw it in a documentary.

326
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,810
Sweetie, I'm sure it was just an accident.

327
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,530
None of this would have happened

328
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,800
if we'd just gone to Luke's game.

329
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,670
- We're terrible parents for not going. - No. No.

330
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,250
Was that a whistle? Where are you?

331
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,080
Um, I-I'm just walking by a construction site.

332
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,280
Pervs!

333
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,520
Sorry. Sorry. Not you.

334
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,030
I hope Luke's not mad at us.

335
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,500
No, he's fine, honey.

336
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,570
Or he's not. He -- he could be mad.

337
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,920
We don't know. We won't -- we won't know.

338
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,110
I'll -- I'll be home soon, though.

339
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,750
I love you. Okay, bye-bye.

340
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,130
Thank you. It was great.

341
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,660
Hey, Luke, Luke, Luke,

342
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,880
Don't tell your dad I was here, all right? Great game.

343
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,030
Claire?

344
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,590
Claire?

345
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,370
Say good night to daddy.

346
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,180
Mwah! Good night, my boy.

347
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,860
Hey, grandpa, great word you played earlier today.

348
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,330
What does "Syzygy" even mean?

349
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,460
It means 45 points. Ha!

350
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,230
Hey, everybody, you remember my sister, Pam.

351
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,550
Oh, hi, Pam.

352
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,600
She's here to pay a visit and cast aspersions.

353
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,900
- Oh, grow up. - You grow up.

354
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,070
Real good one.

355
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,440
Hi, y'all. I brought boar.

356
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,110
Oh. Well, let me give you a hand with that.

357
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,040
Cam, look, I know you're upset,

358
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,050
But please just try and let it go tonight.

359
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,190
Well, can you believe she said I'm the emotionally fragile one?

360
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,410
I mean, how crazy is that?

361
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,520
- Boy. - "Boy"?

362
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,490
Is that your thinly veiled

363
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,840
way of saying you agree with her?

364
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,220
Okay, you know what?

365
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,220
If I was fragile, I would care,

366
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,270
but I'm not, so I don't.

367
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,980
- Good. - Good.

368
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,740
And you know what? That shirt washes you out,

369
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,250
so don't be shocked when someone mistakes you for a beige candle.

370
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,340
Hey, everyone.

371
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,540
- Hi, Luke. - Hey, buddy.

372
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,420
I'm so sorry I missed your game.

373
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,650
We are both so sorry we missed your game.

374
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,800
The universe punished me.

375
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,810
I did something awful to a bunch of baby crows.

376
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,230
Actually, it's not a bunch of crows.

377
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,270
It's called a murder.

378
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,970
I know what I did!

379
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
- How was your game? - Fine. Nothing special.

380
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,420
What do you mean, "Fine, nothing special"?

381
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,950
Well, there was this girl on the 16-year-old team

382
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,220
who wasn't wearing a bra.

383
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,930
So that was cool.

384
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,180
But Josh's mom texted me.

385
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,080
She said you were having a great game.

386
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,350
She drinks.

387
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,270
I-I'll be right back.

388
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,080
- Hey, Phil. - Hey, Pam.

389
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,450
Oh. Sorry.

390
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,780
It's my parents again.

391
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm getting married soon,

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,910
and they're already acting like they have empty nest syndrome.

393
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,830
I appreciate you not saying

394
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,140
anything to your dad about me being there,

395
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,200
but why aren't you telling him what a great game you played?

396
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,350
I can tell he feels bad enough for missing it.

397
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,900
I don't want to make him feel worse.

398
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,990
I screwed up.

399
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,090
Why? What's wrong?

400
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,400
I talked Phil into skipping Luke's game,

401
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,880
and then I went, and, of course, he played the game of his life.

402
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,830
But Luke doesn't want to

403
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,850
tell Phil about the game now

404
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,160
because he doesn't want to hurt his feelings.

405
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,600
Oh, well, I think it's sweet that Luke's protecting Phil.

406
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,660
You know, we all have to protect my sister in my family

407
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,550
because she's a disaster.

408
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,510
I mean, you can see it, right?

409
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,770
I think it was a little weird she brought pig to a party.

410
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,450
Hey! I can say it.

411
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,610
Hey, hon.

412
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm sorry about what I did before.

413
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,160
I saw this, and I thought it would look beautiful on you.

414
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,970
You know I can't stay mad at you

415
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,660
when you buy me...

416
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,860
glasses, you son of a bitch!

417
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,760
Just try 'em on. You'll still look gorgeous.

418
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,060
I will try them on when you buy hearing aids!

419
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,080
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.

420
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,830
Um, I have a, uh, hearing-test app on my phone.

421
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,850
Let's do it!

422
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,590
- You do it! - Okay.

423
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,610
Everybody under the age of 60 should be able to hear this.

424
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,560
- Yes. Heard that. - Yeah, definitely.

425
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,760
What? You're lying. You didn't hear anything.

426
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,130
We did! You see, you're deaf!

427
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,220
Okay, 70.

428
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,480
Mm-hmm. Yes.

429
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,700
Oh, what is th-- did she put you up to this?

430
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,960
Here, grandpa, I'll play you something even louder.

431
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,100
Okay, I heard that one.

432
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,900
I didn't press anything.

433
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,700
Oh, look who's a cheater.

434
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,020
Don't worry about it, big guy.

435
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,010
I have trouble smelling lemons.

436
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,410
You know, I don't need any of this.

437
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,530
But I'll tell you what I can hear loud and clear.

438
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,360
The sound of you all munching free food.

439
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,710
Oh, come on, dad,

440
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,760
aren't you being a little oversensitive?

441
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,450
Oh, well, we can consult my sister, Pam.

442
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,630
She's the self-appointed sensitivity expert.

443
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,580
- Oh, let it go. - I will not let it go.

444
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,510
In fact, I would like

445
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,470
everyone to be honest with me, please, right now.

446
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,860
No sugar-coating.

447
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,670
My sister here seems to think you all

448
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,870
- have to walk on eggshells around me. - Eggshells.

449
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,230
Do you all think I'm so fragile

450
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,320
you can't tell me things

451
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,840
for fear of how I will react?

452
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,280
- Well. - Claire, don't. Zip. Bup-bup-bup.

453
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,010
No, let her talk, please.

454
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,380
Claire, you have the floor.

455
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,890
W-well, you're not not fragile.

456
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,620
Okay, well, why don't you give me an example

457
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,490
of something you haven't told me

458
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,410
because you were worried I couldn't handle it?

459
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,480
Go on.

460
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,790
All right.

461
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,540
Last week when we were supposed to have lunch

462
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,810
and you canceled...

463
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,350
Beyonce was at the restaurant.

464
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,920
Okay. The singer or Pepper's dog?

465
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,150
The singer.

466
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,590
And when I was leaving,

467
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,300
I-I-I stopped and I said hello to her

468
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,870
and we chatted for like 10 minutes.

469
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,430
Okay, that's great.

470
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,150
I'm glad you had that experience?

471
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,500
I mean, I don't know what you talked to her about,

472
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,940
seeing that you don't know any of her songs

473
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,160
other than "Single ladies,"

474
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,840
Which everyone knows.

475
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,050
- I love that song. гн I'm surprised you can hear it.

476
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,640
Well, this was fun. Who's hungry?

477
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,650
Hey, where's that boar?

478
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,070
Okay, anyone else?

479
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,780
Well, since we're coming clean,

480
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,600
you overuse the word "Divine."

481
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
It's just an ice-cream sandwich.

482
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,390
You're the boy who cried "Divine."

483
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,740
Okay. Was not aware of that.

484
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,230
- Duly noted. - Hey, I got one.

485
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,910
Remember that blue rotary phone you gave me for Christmas?

486
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,440
- Yes. - I tossed it.

487
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,960
Okay. May I ask the reason?

488
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,790
It made me feel like

489
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,360
Ann-Margret in "Bye-bye Birdie."

490
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,970
- Why?! - Okay, anyone else?

491
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,300
I don't really like the

492
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,220
- shirts with the crazy cuffs. - Oh, I'm sorry.

493
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,950
Can you push your boobs down?

494
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,140
Because I couldn't hear you.

495
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,330
- Here we go. - No, no, here we don't go.

496
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,280
This is fine. I'm fine, okay?

497
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,780
Sometimes when you read to me,

498
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,330
I pretend to fall asleep so you'll go.

499
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,590
I heard that one.

500
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,360
Well, I heard you all loud and clear.

501
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,310
I have to use the restroom.

502
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,890
So, Cam, you're sensitive.

503
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,680
Big deal. It's one of your best qualities.

504
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,190
Thank you, Phil,

505
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,130
and I'm sorry your Beyonce-loving wife

506
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,730
went to Luke's game without you.

507
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,750
See? Farm strong!

508
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,120
You went to Luke's game?

509
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,850
I did, Phil, and I am so sorry.

510
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,140
I did not mean to.

511
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,770
But then he started playing the most amazing game,

512
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,050
and I got so wrapped up in it.

513
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,370
I know I should have called.

514
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,230
Yeah, you should've called.

515
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,050
You were amazing?

516
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,900
Oh, he was incredible. I wish you'd been there.

517
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,070
Then why'd you make me skip it?!

518
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,380
I knew you had it in you!

519
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,920
Oh, coach said he's gonna start next week.

520
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,710
You're starting? I'm so mad at you!

521
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,530
I'm so proud of you!

522
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,130
- Hey, how are you doing in here? - Fine.

523
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,730
I'm a little embarrassed about my outburst,

524
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,090
but otherwise...

525
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,590
You had a lot to take in.

526
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,940
As a lawyer, I should've told you,

527
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,070
never ask questions you don't want the answer to.

528
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,910
Am I really that much of a mess?

529
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,520
Are you not listening to me?

530
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,550
- Hey. Room in here for me? - Not really.

531
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,130
Look, I'm real sorry I said what I said.

532
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,310
No, no, you're right.

533
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,820
I am the Cam of the family.

534
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,960
Apparently, I'm the Cam of two families, so...

535
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,850
So what if you go a little cuckoo

536
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,310
when you get bad news?

537
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,830
You also go all cuckoo when you hear good news.

538
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,840
It's one of the things I love most about you.

539
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,880
No, that's -- that's true.

540
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,470
You're the -- you're the first person I call

541
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,350
when I have good news.

542
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,830
I mean, remember when I got my adult braces removed?

543
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,910
Your teeth look divi-- divine.

544
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,120
See? I can't help it. I'm a celebrator.

545
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,520
Of course you are.

546
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,750
And I should have celebrated how lucky Bo is

547
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,480
to land a great gal like you.

548
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,370
Look at me. I'm crying like a Cam.

549
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,620
Sorry, old habits.

550
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,170
- Are you mad because I embarrassed you? - Forget about it.

551
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,350
And I'm gonna ease up on the glasses, too.

552
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
It's just that I worry, you know,

553
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,230
you're not seeing everything.

554
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,810
I'm getting old, Jay.

555
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,830
When Manny was little,

556
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,340
I used to run around with him all day

557
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,870
without getting tired.

558
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,070
Today at Joe's baby class,

559
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,070
a 6-year-old had to pull me out of the ball pit.

560
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,780
Hold on. Manny used to run around?

561
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,640
All the mothers are so young and perky.

562
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,520
I hate being the oldest one there.

563
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,470
Well, I for one love that you're getting older.

564
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,330
It makes me feel closer to you.

565
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,360
So you'll like it if I get all wrinkly and saggy?

566
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,860
Well, I wouldn't make it a goal.

567
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,450
Okay, I'll wear them.

568
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,020
What?

569
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,570
Nothing.

570
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,870
You have lines there.

571
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,000
I can see them very clearly now with these --

572
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,060
Okay, okay, these are just for reading.

573
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,000
I won't be able to hear her.

574
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,420
She won't be able to see me.

575
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,160
We'll be together forever.

576
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,820
Congratulations.

577
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,190
You officially beat me in "Words with friends."

578
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,390
Better luck next time, kid.

579
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,880
Okay, I have to ask -- did you cheat?

580
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,140
Is that how you won?

581
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,360
I never took you for a sore loser.

582
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,540
That's not an answer.

583
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,650
Listen, one day you might be the smartest person in this family,

584
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,980
but today is not that day.

585
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,000
So tread lightly before you assiduously malign

586
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,690
the veracity of my etymological prowess.

587
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,130
Jay Pritchett out.

588
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,140
You broke your phone, smarty-pants.

589
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,100
Damn it!
