1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,620
Traditional "First day of school" Pancakes.

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,720
- Whipped-cream smile? - Dad, I'm in high school now.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,250
Just put it in my mouth.

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,100
Okay, that's disgusting. Stop it.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,610
Hey, save some of that bossing people around

6
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,040
for the office, lady.

7
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,490
After a 20-year vacation,

8
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,290
Claire is rejoining the work force.

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:17,970
Not a vacation.

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,050
But I am starting a job at my dad's closet company.

11
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,850
He's kind of grooming me to take over.

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,260
I have a background in marketing.

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,650
I'm so proud of her.

14
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,240
Oh, uh, speaking of marketing -- we're out of milk.

15
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,610
I'm actually kind of nervous.

16
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,150
You're gonna be great.

17
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,390
And remember, if you get into a jam,

18
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,350
just do the impression I taught you.

19
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,680
Hey. You can hang your clothes in me.

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,410
Christopher walk-in closet.

21
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,100
I'm not doing that.

22
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,710
Okay, relax, mom. You're working for grandpa.

23
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,710
It's not even a real job.

24
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,400
It's like that summer when I worked for dad.

25
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,360
He was just trying to make me feel good about myself.

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,540
He didn't really need my help.

27
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,120
That's not true.

28
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,130
I needed your help distributing all those fliers.

29
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,850
And I did. Wink, wink.

30
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,270
How are you already doing homework?

31
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,760
It's junior year. I have to get good grades.

32
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,110
Don't you know how competitive it is out there?

33
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,400
Stop pressuring me!

34
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,500
You know, this is what happens to kids

35
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,990
when they're not sexually active.

36
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,620
Don't you have some studying to do?

37
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,970
Please, it's community college.

38
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,950
They tell you to bring a glue stick.

39
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,930
Hello.

40
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,300
Yes, this is he -- him -- me.

41
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,460
Right the first time.

42
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,510
I'll be right there.

43
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,550
Mitchell, that was it.

44
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,990
That was the call. I'm going in.

45
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,870
Due to budget cuts, my position as middle-school music teacher

46
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,920
has been eliminated,

47
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,830
So I've been working as a high-school sub.

48
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,790
Ka-ching!

49
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,560
I never know when I'll be summoned to swoop into action.

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,100
I'm kind of like batman.

51
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,560
But except for a bat-signal, I get a phone call.

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,500
Yeah, you found the one difference.

53
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,190
I hate to miss her first day,

54
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,020
but do you mind taking Lily to school?

55
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,850
Oh, Cam, today?

56
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,430
I got to prep for my meeting with Charlie.

57
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,380
I only get him for an hour

58
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,630
between his vacations in Aspen and Cabo.

59
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,940
Okay, you need to confront him

60
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,890
and tell him his pathetic little midlife crisis

61
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,600
is making it impossible for you to do your job.

62
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,690
Because he responds so well to criticism.

63
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,680
No, he'll fire me, and then we'll end up

64
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,430
having to get married in your family's barn.

65
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,750
Oh, well, we need to book that soon

66
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,010
because spring is hoedown season,

67
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,530
And then you get right into summer stock, so...

68
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,140
I don't believe any of that.

69
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,840
All right, if I'm gonna take Lily, I need to hurry.

70
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,330
Lily, sweetheart, let's get you dressed.

71
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,940
Hey, I've been dressed for an hour.

72
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,780
Come on, I can't be late. I'll fall behind.

73
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,980
Sometimes I forget to factor in the Asian.

79
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,920
Buddy, I know a new school can be scary,

80
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,020
so a little advice --

81
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,370
Every time you meet someone new, pay them a compliment.

82
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,130
Like, um, "I love your hair."

83
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,240
"Awesome kicks." "You have a beautiful smile."

84
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,170
Okay, dad, I'll tell that big guy over there

85
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,610
that he's got a beautiful smile.

86
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,250
Fine. Skin, cheekbones, make it your own.

87
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,880
Um, could you maybe not walk me all the way in?

88
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,430
What?

89
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,380
I've got it from here.

90
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,350
Sure. Yeah. Okay. Give your dad a --

91
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,790
Off you go. Alex!

92
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,830
Ay, Manny, why are you so quiet?

93
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,520
Are you nervous because of your first day in high school?

94
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,560
Mom, after spending a summer in Colombia,

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,320
I'm a changed man.

96
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,890
Oh, my God, what did you see?!

97
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,390
Nothing,

98
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,440
but I am an international jet-setter now.

99
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,370
I'm sophisticated.

100
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,930
And you think that the girls are gonna pick up on this?

101
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,170
If not, I still have my "Unaccompanied minor" Sign.

102
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,600
Ay, I cannot believe

103
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,230
that my little baby's going to the high school.

104
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,210
Mom, stop. You're embarrassing me.

105
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,770
It's my first day, too. I could use a hug.

106
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,870
Go!

107
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,940
- Hey, Gloria. - Hi, Phil.

108
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,530
First day of high school, huh?

109
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,730
Is Manny excited?

110
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,650
Ay, he was up at 5:00 in the morning, ironing.

111
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,170
Ay, but he does that, too, when he's depressed,

112
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,620
so now I don't know.

113
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,960
How was Luke?

114
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,470
Great. Yeah, he had a hard time saying goodbye.

115
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,980
But, um, anyway, I think I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.

116
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,560
- Can I go with you? - Yeah.

117
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,600
Dude, I'm kind of working something here.

118
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,790
How many trucks would that take?

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,240
Give me a minute, Fred.

120
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,720
New girl just walked in.

121
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,060
That's disgusting. She's my daughter.

122
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,410
Sweetheart, you look terrific.

123
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,110
Are you sure?

124
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,360
'cause I have another blouse in -- in here.

125
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,410
It's the only thing in here, that and a pair of glasses

126
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,510
In case I need to read something or look smarter.

127
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,530
Relax.

128
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,610
It's your first day.

129
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,500
Impossible to blow it. What are those?

130
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,960
Oh, cookies -- I made them for the office.

131
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,910
Huge mistake. Fred, two more seconds.

132
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,690
I got a situation here. Put the cookies down.

133
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,410
- Why? - You're management.

134
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,780
Makes you look desperate.

135
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,470
Makes you look like you want everyone to like you.

136
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,590
I do want everyone to like me.

137
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,970
You want everyone to respect you.

138
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,680
You got to be tough. Keep your distance.

139
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:41,180
Well, maybe we are different kinds of managers.

140
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,690
Yeah, I'm yours. Just leave the cookies.

141
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,170
Look at you, my big first-grader.

142
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,720
All right, I want you to make so many friends

143
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,960
and have so much fun.

144
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,740
Got to go! I can't wait to learn!

145
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,560
- Be careful! - What?

146
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,060
Nothing.

147
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,910
Please do not be late. Let's go. Looking good.

148
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,100
Uh, uh, Principal Brown?

149
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,310
- Yes. - Hi. I'm Cameron Tucker.

150
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,510
I was called in to sub today.

151
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,780
Oh, yeah, you're in for Mrs. Hurley. Hello.

152
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,540
- Hello. - She has come down with a sudden case of rehab.

153
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,670
So do a good job

154
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,000
'cause this could be a permanent position.

155
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,750
Well, prepare to feel like an old denim vest

156
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,940
because I'm about to "Be-dazzling" You.

157
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,530
I don't know what that means, but okay.

158
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,870
So, what am I teaching?

159
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,280
A.P. History.

160
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,810
I desperately wanted that job.

161
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,890
There was just one problem --

162
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,260
I don't know much about history.

163
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,540
Do you know much biology?

164
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,120
Not now, Mitchell.

165
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,360
What about your science book or the French you took?

166
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,240
You're lucky I love you.

167
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,970
And I know that if you love me, too...

168
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,700
What a wonderful world this would be

169
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,270
I really was in a jam, though.

170
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,040
My dad thinks that he can motivate his workers

171
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,020
by being a cold, distant authority figure.

172
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,910
Well, if his style is so effective, riddle me this --

173
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,890
why didn't I listen to him?

174
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,460
Hey.

175
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,540
Hi. Sorry. I'm Claire.

176
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,380
It's my first day, so I thought I'd say hi.

177
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:07,330
- Oh. Hey. - Amazing.

178
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,060
You guys are actually hanging out by the water cooler.

179
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,860
I have xerostomia. It's chronic dry mouth.

180
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,010
I'm -- I'm so sorry.

181
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,740
I-I-I-I was just doin' a thang, you know, like...

182
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,640
Anyway,

183
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,340
My door's always open... to everyone.

184
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,750
That's Pritchett's daughter.

185
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,770
Um, yeah, but I don't want you to think of me like that.

186
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,090
I'm -- I'm a friend. I'm a colleague.

187
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,050
I'm just like you.

188
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,110
I'm Claire, you know -- worker bee, just...

189
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,740
Great to meet you.

190
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,130
Sorry to interrupt, and see you around.

191
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,470
I do -- I got to do this one.

192
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,530
Who am I?

193
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,890
You can hang your clothes in me.

194
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,930
Christopher walk-in closet.

195
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,070
What is this?

196
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,800
Oh, sorry, folks. It's closed. We're shooting a commercial.

197
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,010
So annoying.

198
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,620
Listen, we just want to get a cup of coffee.

199
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,540
Actually, we're short a couple of extras.

200
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,010
How would you two like to be in it?

201
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,040
- Yes! - That sounds amazing.

202
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,310
Hey, um, I see a couple of old people.

203
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,340
This isn't one of those catheter commercials, is it?

204
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,510
'Cause if it gets too descriptive,

205
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,750
I'm gonna squirm.

206
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,340
I just did it to myself.

207
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,380
I did my best to cram for my lecture

208
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,270
on the revolutionary war, but, ugh.

209
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,820
All those names and dates -- it's all so dry.

210
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,760
Where's the drama?

211
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,250
Good morrow!

212
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,110
Oh, boy.

213
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,640
Oh, what is all this strange garb you adorn?

214
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,900
Are you trappers from the Canadian provinces?

215
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,170
Are you here to sell your beavers?

216
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,520
Who are you?

217
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,930
The 64-pence question.

218
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,750
I crossed the Delaware during the Revolutionary War.

219
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,440
I spent a brutal winter in Valley Forge.

220
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,420
Who am I?

221
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,230
I-I have no idea.

222
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,100
I-I swear I don't know who this man is.

223
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,450
I'm George Washington, of course.

224
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,030
Our syllabus says we're supposed to cover

225
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,060
Native Americans on the eve of colonization.

226
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,250
Yes. Native Americans. Indians!

227
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,330
A majestic, peaceful people,

228
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:25,530
who lived off the land and cried when they saw litter.

229
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,010
The textbook says many tribes were often at war,

230
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,310
with allegiances shifting all of the ti--

231
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,610
Shifting all the time!

232
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:35,110
So, were the Indians friends with the Colonists or not?

233
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,140
Ah! Yes.

234
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,320
I know one Indian

235
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,700
who was friends with a construction worker, biker,

236
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,150
and traffic cop.

237
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,080
Uh, do y-- nothing?

238
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,140
Seriously, nothing?

239
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,620
Okay, your parents are gonna love that joke.

240
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,300
Okay, Pritchett, I'm here. You got a half-hour.

241
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,610
I have my helicopter standing by on the roof.

242
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,730
Is it even built for that?

243
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,560
No. That's why you only have a half-hour.

244
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,880
Well, I'm not sure that's gonna be enough time.

245
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,720
We have a ton to cover.

246
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,860
We need to talk about new lease agreements

247
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,170
and the workers' comp package.

248
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,860
29 minutes. I think I hear creaking.

249
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,810
Daddy, I'm bored.

250
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:08,920
Me, too.

251
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,020
This is why I shouldn't come into work between vacations.

252
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,180
Why don't you sit at Natalie's desk

253
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,170
and pretend to be my assistant, sweetie?

254
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,220
Sorry about that. My niece is coming to pick her up.

255
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,480
Lily had an incident at school today where she --

256
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,100
Hey, Pritchett,

257
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,500
you're not some hot single mom i'm trying to seduce,

258
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,900
so I don't need to hear about your kid.

259
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,880
Fair enough. So, lease agreements.

260
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,140
Okay, I'm getting some push-back on the Miami location.

261
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,280
Mr. Pritchett, I have a Haley here to see you.

262
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,180
Oh. Okay.

263
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,080
Hi, sweetheart.

264
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,840
I'm in the middle of a meeting with my boss,

265
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,660
but thank you so much for helping me out.

266
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,410
No problem.

267
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,830
My last class is a pass/fail.

268
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,250
And it's community college, so it's pass.

269
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,480
Hi. Charlie Bingham.

270
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,040
Look at your eyes.

271
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,610
Oh. I-I can't.

272
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,520
I like you.

273
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,980
What do you think of these pants?

274
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,300
It's part of our new collection.

275
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,290
It's, uh, a lot of zippers.

276
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,070
It's too many, right?

277
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,520
And they poke into my thigh when I'm in my helicopter.

278
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,160
'Cause I have a helicopter. It's not a big deal.

279
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,470
Okay, so, anyway, thank you.

280
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,180
You seem to know a lot about fashion.

281
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,040
I'd like to get your opinion on a few things.

282
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,080
- Sure. - Yeah?

283
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,800
- Yeah. - Actually, no, she -- she needs to stay and watch Lily.

284
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,090
Yeah, you can do that.

285
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,470
Hey, princess. Hey.

286
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,790
I love kids.

287
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,800
Daddy's office.

288
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,350
You sound like a little girl.

289
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,680
Hey, you wanted to see me?

290
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,460
Thanks for "Bzzzing" By.

291
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,170
I hope you weren't in the middle of a "Thang."

292
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,200
Okay, that did get a little away from me.

293
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,570
But to be fair, I broke the ice.

294
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,090
Everybody thinks you're a dummy.

295
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,800
Not everybody. No, as a matter of fact,

296
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,760
One of the guys in the break room asked me to lunch.

297
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,980
- His name is Todd. - Don't say Todd.

298
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,570
Oh, no.

299
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,410
You cannot go to lunch with Todd.

300
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:43,960
Why not?

301
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,100
You can't be associated with him.

302
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,260
Up until an hour ago,

303
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,520
he was the office weirdo.

304
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,650
But he was nice to me,

305
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,850
And he helped me set up my computer.

306
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,290
Yeah, that's his job. For now.

307
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,120
What does that mean?

308
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,190
I'm firing him as soon as I can find an I.T. Guy

309
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,330
who shows up on time

310
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,270
and doesn't creep out the office.

311
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,590
I can't cancel on the one person who was nice to me.

312
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,390
You can, but you won't,

313
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,260
'cause you're the type of person who brings cookies to the office.

314
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:05,870
Where are they?

315
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,270
Okay, we're done here.

316
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,040
Okay, folks, you're just having a normal conversation,

317
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,780
a typical day in a coffee shop, all right?

318
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,940
Roger that.

319
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,270
Here we go, guys.

320
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,990
And...action!

321
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,370
How have you been, Roy?

322
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,270
Ah, a little down.

323
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,200
Helen and I really miss the kids,

324
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,790
But we just can't afford to visit them right now.

325
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,540
- Have you considered a reverse mortgage? - What's that?

326
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,840
- You have equity in your home, right? - This coffee is delicious!

327
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,460
All right, you two in the back, we can hear you,

328
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,710
So just mime your conversation.

329
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,990
Mime -- mime -- I knew that.

330
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,600
I was already doing that, so just follow my lead.

331
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,030
Okay, sorry, sorry. We'll do it again.

332
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,320
But everything else is okay?

333
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,290
You haven't done anything else.

334
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,990
- So, yeah? - Back to one, guys.

335
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,730
Action.

336
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,470
How have you been, Roy?

337
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,150
Ah, a little down.

338
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,710
Helen and I really miss the kids,

339
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,040
But we just can't afford to visit them right now.

340
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,010
- Have you considered a reverse mortgage? - What's that?

341
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,890
You have equity in your home, right?

342
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,110
- Sure, we do. - What are they doing?

343
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,780
Is she answering an imaginary phone?

344
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,230
Oh, that sounds too good to be true.

345
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,510
Don't take my word for it.

346
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,420
Here's Henry Winkler to tell you more.

347
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,410
Okay, cut.

348
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,150
Couple in the back.

349
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,520
Yep. No, I know. I know. Bigger?

350
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,030
The native Americans and the settlers

351
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,650
had two completely different ideas of land ownership.

352
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,080
Eventually, these differences would lead to war.

353
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,310
Oh. Look, goose bumps.

354
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,210
Okay, yes. Uh, class dismissed.

355
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,620
We did it!

356
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,570
Thank you so much for stepping in. Oh, and I promise,

357
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,930
Tomorrow, I will do my best to be more prepared.

358
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,710
Tomorrow? Why won't Mrs. Hurley be back?

359
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,350
Well, I don't want to be indelicate,

360
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,180
But the good news is, is I might be your permanent teacher.

361
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,600
- I don't want you to be my permanent teacher. - Oh, what?

362
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,070
You'd rather have a raging alcoholic?

363
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:52,830
Listen to me.

364
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,270
I've worked nonstop to build the perfect academic record,

365
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,070
And I'm not going to let you screw it up now.

366
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,310
I have an A.P. Test in 160 days,

367
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,220
and I need to ace it.

368
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,320
Can you get me there or not?

369
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,870
I can rally like the brave men of the Alamo.

370
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,870
You do realize that all the men of the alamo died?

371
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,670
They all died!

372
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,250
Ruthie's older, so she thinks she's the boss.

373
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,960
But for a little guy, Stu holds his own.

374
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,410
They can be a handful.

375
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,760
But, god, they make me laugh so hard, you know?

376
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,900
I did not know you could even tell the gender of a turtle.

377
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,530
Oh, yeah.

378
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,810
It's called "Sexing the turtle," And it's an eight-step process.

379
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,790
Now, let's pretend your hand is a turtle.

380
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,070
- Okay. - What you do is you flip it over.

381
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,900
And then you have to look right into --

382
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,160
Oh, okay. I get it. I get it. I think I get it.

383
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,080
Oh. I know. I'm droning on, aren't I?

384
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,420
Please, stop. Please stop!

385
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,320
You're not. You're not.

386
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,440
I am. But enough about my family.

387
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,400
Tell me about yours.

388
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,600
All right, well, my husband Phil's a realtor.

389
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,440
That's funny. I'm buying a house.

390
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,820
Why? When?

391
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,810
Actually, we have the final walk-through today,

392
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,080
Sign the papers tomorrow.

393
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,800
Th-that's a really big deal, Todd.

394
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,010
Yeah, and it's a bit of a stretch for us, too,

395
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,290
But, uh, no, the time is right.

396
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,420
We're just -- we're gonna do it.

397
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,950
"We" is you and the turtles?

398
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,090
No, me and my wife.

399
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,130
A w-- I'm sorry.

400
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,390
You didn't mention your wife. That's great.

401
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,730
I bet she's got a big, fancy, high-paying job, right?

402
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,330
Uh, she's getting her master's.

403
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,940
- In? - Latin.

404
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,330
Oh, Todd.

405
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,500
This may not be the best time to buy a house.

406
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,590
I hate to be the one to break this to you --

407
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,910
Oh. No, no, no, no, I got this.

408
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,830
No, you don't.

409
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,390
Stand by, everyone.

410
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,800
I really felt like I nailed that last one.

411
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,550
I still feel so stiff.

412
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,680
I don't know what to pretend saying.

413
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,320
You're thinking too much. Just draw from your own life.

414
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,000
Like, how was your day today?

415
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,260
Lousy. My own son didn't want to hug me.

416
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,880
Okay, so use that.

417
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,790
My character, Dr. Stephen Wilson,

418
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,870
Is also sad because his son wouldn't take his advice

419
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,710
And he wanted to be dropped off a block away from school.

420
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,750
He expected that from his daughters

421
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,580
But thought his son would be different.

422
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,210
That's so sad.

423
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,030
But Dr. Stephen wilson is not going to let that

424
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,930
ruin breakfast with his mistress.

425
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,500
You know, maybe it's just time for us to --

426
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,280
to accept that we have to let them go.

427
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,320
Maybe it is.

428
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,490
Okay, everyone, here we go. We're rolling.

429
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,230
And action!

430
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,690
How have you been, Roy?

431
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,050
Ah, a little down.

432
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,600
Helen and I really miss the kids,

433
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,170
But we just can't afford to visit them right now.

434
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,330
- Have you considered a reverse mortgage? - What's that?

435
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:41,340
Uh, you have equity in your home, right?

436
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,310
- Sure, we do. - Please, no crying.

437
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,970
You're gonna make me cry, too.

438
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,480
Well, essentially the bank buys your house.

439
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,220
But you still get to live in it.

440
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,220
That sounds too good to be true.

441
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,670
Don't take my word for it.

442
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,130
Here's Henry Winkler to tell us more.

443
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,090
I don't want the Fonz to see me like this.

444
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,400
It's a prototype. It can withstand

445
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,180
the most extreme temperatures on the planet.

446
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,910
It's waterproof, and it wicks sweat.

447
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,250
It also repels women.

448
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,120
I know. I hate it. I'll burn it tonight!

449
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,080
Aah! Actually, it doesn't burn.

450
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,050
Anyway, if we could get back to the lease agreements here.

451
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,050
You're amazing. How would you fix it?

452
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,230
It's too boxy.

453
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,100
Probably have to take it in here...

454
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,260
- Right. - ...and here.

455
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,310
Yeah, I probably overdo it in the gym.

456
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,590
Stupid 7% body fat.

457
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,010
Okay, so getting back to work.

458
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,760
We are working. Why are we working?!

459
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,430
I got to go to Cabo. Hey, you want to come with me?

460
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,230
Oh, I've, uh, never been to Cabo.

461
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,470
Yeah, she's not going to cabo 'cause she's half your age.

462
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,870
- How old are you? - Who cares?

463
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,340
Pretty soon, I'm gonna look 20.

464
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,780
I've been meditating in one of those pressurized eggs.

465
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,690
Well, if I went to cabo,

466
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,940
what would the sleeping situation be?

467
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,660
Not much.

468
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,870
Okay, no, that is enough! No! No!

469
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,190
She is my niece!

470
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,130
Okay?

471
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,920
This pathetic midlife crisis of yours

472
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,190
is -- is hurting the company,

473
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,840
and I'm getting so sick of cleaning up your messes.

474
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,740
Y-you need to focus and you need to start acting your age --

475
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,300
Your -- your real age, not your egg age.

476
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,570
Normally, if someone talked to me that way, I'd fire him.

477
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,220
But I respect your honesty. I respect your passion.

478
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,160
It's like me. I'm a very passionate man.

479
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,730
Just focus.

480
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,770
You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right.

481
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,750
What's that creaking?

482
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,490
Hut! Hike!

483
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,240
Oh, hey, you're going the wrong way!

484
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,750
That's the wrong way! No!

485
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,470
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right.

486
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,330
Uh, excuse me, principal Brown.

487
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,460
Yikes. You know, most subs just play a movie.

488
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,290
All right, do something different, guys.

489
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,920
Uh, listen, I-I can't be your history teacher.

490
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,270
Those kids work so hard, and they deserve someone

491
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,120
who knows the material and can inspire them, so...

492
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,500
If you say so.

493
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,630
Hey, I was wondering,

494
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,920
what kind of play was that you were running?

495
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,120
Was that supposed to be a slant?

496
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,520
Our freshman coach quit.

497
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,320
I'm just a glorified babysitter.

498
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,390
Well, your receiver needs to learn to run his routes,

499
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,870
or the quarterback's never gonna be able to hit him.

500
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,000
- I-I played in college. - Oh. Okay.

501
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,130
Hey, Tyler, you need to learn to run your routes.

502
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,420
What routes?

503
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,000
Yeah, what routes?

504
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,510
Well, you're gonna line up here.

505
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,890
Take three steps.

506
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,710
One, two, three -- plant right,

507
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,680
Open left 45 degrees up the field.

508
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,110
Okay, why don't we try it again?

509
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,340
Try it again! Tip!

510
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,070
Put some zip on the ball, 18!

511
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,850
Hut, hut, hike!

512
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,780
Hit him!

513
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,930
Better. Better. Good job. Circle back up.

514
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,880
All right, anyway, thank you for the opportunity.

515
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,980
Hey, hey, how would you like to take over this team?

516
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,400
Well, well, that's an interesting offer.

517
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,770
- How much does it pay? - Nothing.

518
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,560
Are you firm on that?

519
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,680
Yeah, but there's a gym-teacher position available.

520
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,640
- It's all yours if you coach. - Can I wear shorts?

521
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,910
Yeah, and you get a whistle, too.

522
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,880
Oh, I always get a whistle when I wear shorts.

523
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,960
I humbly accept your offer.

524
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,570
Huddle up, boys! Let's go! Hustle!

525
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,770
Do you know what hustle means, 10?!

526
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,020
It really wasn't bad.

527
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,390
Todd is a very interesting guy when you get to know him.

528
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,050
Did he tell you about his turtles, little Lulu and Stan?

529
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,510
Ruthie and Stu.

530
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,380
That's the name he picks?

531
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,780
"Turtle stew"? Idiot!

532
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,980
Well, there was one little situation that came up,

533
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,770
but I think I handled it pretty well.

534
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,330
- He's about to make, um, kind of a big -- Hold on.

535
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,560
Margaret, why can't I log in here?

536
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,150
What's wrong with my computer?

537
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,620
The whole system's down.

538
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,710
No one can access files. We can't get online.

539
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,340
Where's Todd?

540
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,550
We can't find him anywhere, and his yaris is gone.

541
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,620
- Where are my files?! - What the hell?

542
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,690
I-I might know a little something about this.

543
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,820
What did you do?

544
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,460
Kind of told Todd that you were gonna fire him.

545
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,620
- What?! - I had to.

546
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,100
Dad, he's about to buy a house.

547
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,300
But he was fine with it.

548
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,430
He hugged me and thanked me

549
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,010
and told me that it gave him time to make a plan.

550
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,600
Gentlemen, today is a new beginning.

551
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,010
And that can be scary.

552
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,180
How did it go, Mr. Jet-setter?

553
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,810
Good. Really good.

554
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,220
Do you want to talk about it?

555
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,060
No.

556
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,860
I'm gonna ask things of you that may not make sense right now.

557
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,660
See you tomorrow, Luke.

558
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,210
Not if I see you first.

559
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,690
There it is! There's that smile.

560
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,200
But they will.

561
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,920
- Hey, dad. - Hey, buddy.

562
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,390
- We're at school. - Yep.

563
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,790
Success is not guaranteed.

564
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,040
It is not handed to you.

565
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,400
Success is earned.

566
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,740
How's that data entry going?

567
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,140
Good. I am up to 1998.

568
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,500
Ah, that's when I'd already been doing the job 20 years.

569
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,690
So maybe I should listen to you?

570
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,130
Get you home a lot earlier.

571
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,330
Thanks, boss.

572
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,850
Today, we are forging a new path, people!

573
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,690
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself!

574
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,550
Wrong president.

575
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,840
- Just keep pushing! - Okay.
