00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:05,804
   - MY NAME IS BARRY ALLEN,    
AND I AM THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE. 

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,473
      WHEN I WAS A CHILD,       
        I SAW MY MOTHER         

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,174
KILLED BY SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE. 

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,943
       - RUN, BARRY, RUN!       

5
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,945
   - MY FATHER WENT TO PRISON   
        FOR HER MURDER.         

6
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:16,849
        THEN AN ACCIDENT        
    MADE ME THE IMPOSSIBLE.     

7
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,585
   TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD, I'M    
AN ORDINARY FORENSIC SCIENTIST, 

8
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,653
  BUT SECRETLY I USE MY SPEED   

9
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,189
         TO FIGHT CRIME         
    AND FIND OTHERS LIKE ME,    

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,859
     AND ONE DAY I'LL FIND      
    WHO KILLED MY MOTHER...     

11
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,128
             - MOM!             
- AND GET JUSTICE FOR MY FATHER.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,130
        I AM THE FLASH.

       I HEAR YOU'VE BEEN       
       WRITING ABOUT ME.        

16
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,439
          - I'VE BEEN           
   COLLECTING INTERNET POSTS    

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,641
  ABOUT THE STREAK SIGHTINGS.   
   - BABY, THERE'S NO STREAK.   

18
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,643
      - I SAW HIM, BARRY.       
      HE WEARS A RED SUIT.      

19
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,514
 - I FINALLY DIAGNOSED WHY IRIS 
  IS WRITING ABOUT THE STREAK.  

20
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,015
     SHE'S DOING IT FOR ME.     

21
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,251
      - I'M GONNA FIND OUT      
    WHO REALLY KILLED LAURA,    

22
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,420
         AND I'M GOING          
    TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.     

23
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,188
   - WHOEVER THIS STREAK IS,    

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,324
I AM NOT STOPPING UNTIL THE REST
 OF THE WORLD BELIEVES IN HIM.  

25
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,995
      - MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T      
  SEE EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE.   

26
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,069
        - TO UNDERSTAND         
  WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU,   

27
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,071
YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING FIRST. 

28
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,740
      YOU NEED TO BELIEVE       
       IN THE IMPOSSIBLE.       

29
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,008
        CAN YOU DO THAT?        

30
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,576
    GOOD, BECAUSE ALL OF US,    

31
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,945
       WE HAVE FORGOTTEN        
    WHAT MIRACLES LOOK LIKE.    

32
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,881
MAYBE BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T MADE 
 MUCH OF AN APPEARANCE LATELY.  

33
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,350
OUR LIVES HAVE BECOME ORDINARY, 

34

  WHO IS TRULY EXTRAORDINARY.

      WHERE YOU CAME FROM.      

36

37
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,859
        BUT I HAVE SEEN         
     YOU DO THE IMPOSSIBLE

       WRITING YOUR BLOG.       

48

     - PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW      
        THAT YOU EXIST.

      IT'S JUST SELECTIVE.

  THAT PUT YOU IN HARM'S WAY?

 AND THAT'S JUST IN YOUR HAND.

 DUDE, WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL US?  

118
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,110
  - I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS.  

119
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,179
    BESIDES, I WAS OFF-DUTY.    

120
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,615
             - HMM.             

121
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,517
         - YOU'RE LUCKY         
HE DIDN'T KNOCK OUT YOUR TEETH. 

122
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,519
         THOSE PUPPIES          
        DON'T GROW BACK.        

123
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,056
     - THE STRANGE THING IS     
    I FEEL LIKE I KNEW HIM.     

124
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,657
      - WHAT DO YOU MEAN?       

125
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,928
      - HE SAID SOMETHING       
       THAT WAS FAMILIAR,       

126
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,663
  BUT HE'S GONNA HURT SOMEONE   
     IF WE DON'T STOP HIM.      

127
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,599
    SO HOW DO I FIGHT A GUY     
     THAT'S MADE OF STEEL?      

128

130
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,538
            - YEAH.

     - THERE WAS LIGHTNING      
          IN MY HOUSE.

00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,219
   THERE WAS A MAN IN YELLOW,   
   THEN I WAS ON THE STREET.    

134
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,221
 I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT THERE.  

135
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,892
      PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO       
          BELIEVE ME!           

136
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,660
             - HEY.             

137
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,128
      WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU      
          LAST NIGHT?           

138
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,731
         - GOT BEAT UP          
  BY A STEEL-PLATED SOCIOPATH.  

139
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,967
          GOOD TIMES.           

140
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,403
    - SO HE IS A META-HUMAN?    
            - YEAH.             

141
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,073
 - THAT PARTICLE ACCELERATOR'S  
 THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING. 

142
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,341
           YOU OKAY?            

143
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,076
         - RELATIVELY.          

144
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,678
      ANY IDEA WHO HE IS?       

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,114
     - EDDIE'S TAKING POINT     
    WHILE I RUN DOWN A LEAD.    

146
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,615
  I NEED YOU TO WORK WITH HIM   
       UNTIL I GET BACK.        

147
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,950
        - WAIT, WHY ME?         

148
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,319
   - BECAUSE HE SAW SOMETHING   
           IMPOSSIBLE           

149
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,089
 THAT HE'S GOT QUESTIONS ABOUT, 
 QUESTIONS THAT I CAN'T ANSWER. 

150
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,425
       - IN OTHER WORDS,        
  MAKE UP SOME SCIENCE-Y STUFF  

151
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,761
       TO THROW HIM OFF?        

152
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,596
           - EXACTLY.           

153
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,465
           - [scoffs]           

154
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,801
     - HE STOLE THE HUMVEE      
      AND EVADED CAPTURE.       

155
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,637
 SO PLEASED YOU COULD JOIN US,  
           MR. ALLEN.           

156
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,772
          ROUGH NIGHT?          

157
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,274
 - UH, JUST A LITTLE BEAT, SIR. 

158
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,009
       - AS I WAS SAYING,       

159
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,413
   OUR PERP YANKED THREE ATMs   
 AFTER HE BOOSTED THE VEHICLE.  

160
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,582
      ATM SECURITY CAMERAS      
      CAUGHT HIM ON VIDEO.      

161
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,217
 WE GOT A HIT IN THE DATABASE.  

162
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,118
         TONY WOODWARD.         

163
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,820
       HE'S GOT A HISTORY       
   OF VIOLENCE, PETTY THEFT,    

164
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,189
    ASSAULT, GOING WAY BACK     
           TO JUVIE.            

165
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,124
     DROPPED OFF THE RADAR      
        TEN MONTHS AGO.         

166
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,861
     LOOKS LIKE HE'S BACK.      
     [school bell ringing]      

167
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,296
      - INCREASED PRESSURE      
    PRODUCES INCREASED HEAT,    

168
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,532
  AND IF YOU DON'T RELEASE IT,  
      YOU GET COMBUSTION.       

169
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,901
     - I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU     
REMEMBER ALL THIS STUFF, BARRY. 

170
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,804
 - BECAUSE HE'S A LITTLE FREAK, 
     JUST LIKE HIS OLD MAN.     

171
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,572
   - DON'T TALK ABOUT MY DAD.   

172
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,640
           - OR WHAT?           

173
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,511
  IS HE GONNA MURDER ME, TOO?   

174
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:36,348
    LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE BORN    
   TO TAKE A BEATING, ALLEN.    

175
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,453
            - ALLEN.            

176
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,688
          HEY, ALLEN.           
             - HEY.

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,856
          - YOU OKAY?           

178
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,491
          - HEY, YEAH.          
         SORRY, EDDIE.          

179
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,727
           - LISTEN,            
   I SAW SOMETHING LAST NIGHT   

180
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,229
I JUST CAN'T GET MY HEAD AROUND.

181
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,697
           - UH-HUH.            

182
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,966
    - I FIRED A DOZEN ROUNDS    
       AT OUR CAR THIEF,        

183
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,470
           AND IT WAS           
 LIKE THEY SPARKED OFF OF HIM.  

184
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,472
      - HUH, WELL, I MEAN,      

185
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:04,476
       HE MUST HAVE BEEN        
WEARING SOME KIND OF BODY ARMOR.

186
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,077
         - ON HIS FACE?         

187
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,315
             - UM--             
             - HEY.

00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,050
             BARRY.             

189
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,418
   HI, BABE, I SAW THE NEWS.    

190
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,353

       - YEAH, I'M FINE,        

191
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,255
      WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW      
 IF YOU CHECKED YOUR MESSAGES.  

192
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,290
    I TRIED YOU THREE TIMES.    

193
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,424
            - SORRY.            

194
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,794
      I HAD TO WORK LATE.       

195
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,030
         UM, SO I HEARD         
  THAT THE STREAK SAVED A KID.  

196
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,731
    ANY COMMENT, DETECTIVE?     

197
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,200

  BARRY'S INCIDENT LAST NIGHT.  

211

  I THINK HE'S AT THE STATION.

        I NEED YOUR HELP        
  SOLVING AN OLD CASE OF MINE.  

214
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,944

00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,281
          - THE MURDER          
       OF BARRY'S MOTHER.       

216
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,025
- YOUR CHILDHOOD NEMESIS IS NOW 
   AN UNSTOPPABLE META-HUMAN.   

217
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,094
  THAT IS SERIOUSLY MESSED UP.

   - SO BARRY, WHEN YOU SAID    
 YOU WERE OFF-DUTY LAST NIGHT,

00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,938
            - GOOD.             

259
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,173
          [joint pops]          
          - [screams]           

260
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,444
- ALLEN, YOU REALLY NEED A CAR. 

261
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,513
          - I USUALLY           
      MANAGE ON FOOT OKAY.      

262
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,914
        WHAT DO WE GOT?         

263
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,683
    - THE RIG TONY WOODWARD     
      BOOSTED LAST NIGHT.       

264
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,384
  NO SIGN OF THE STOLEN ATMs.   

265
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,420
          PROBABLY GOT          
   THOSE WHERE HE'S HOLED UP,   

266
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,523
THOUGH HE'S GONNA HAVE ONE HELL 
  OF A TIME BREAKING 'EM OPEN.  

267
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,926
    - I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.    

268
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,496
   - SO, ABOUT YOU AND IRIS--   

269
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,865
 - LOOK, EDDIE, WE HAD A FIGHT, 

270
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,667
    AND I JUST DON'T REALLY     
        FEEL COMFORTABLE        

271
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,269
   TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOU.   

272
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,073
  - I GET THAT, AND I GET THAT  
      YOU TWO GO WAY BACK.      

273
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,109
  TO BE HONEST, I WAS A LITTLE  
  THREATENED BY YOU AT FIRST.   

274
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,444
  - YOU WERE THREATENED BY ME?  

275
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,945
            - SURE.             

276
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,448
       I MEAN, I'VE SEEN        
     HOW CLOSE YOU TWO ARE,     

277
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,016
 BUT YOU SEEM LIKE A GOOD GUY,  

278
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,286
        AND IRIS, I JUST        
     WANT HER TO BE HAPPY.      

279
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,656
      FROM MY EXPERIENCE,       
 GOOD FRIENDS ARE HARD TO FIND. 

280
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,992
          - DETECTIVE.          
           EXCUSE ME.           

281
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,128
     SIR, WE RAN THE PLATES     
        ON THAT HUMVEE--        

282
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,398
       - COME ON, BARRY!        
         YOU CAN DO IT!         

283
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,933
         - BARR, FOCUS!         

284
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,735
            - I AM!             

285
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,270
        - SON, SON, SON.        

286
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,572
   YOU'RE GETTING FRUSTRATED.   

287
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,808
       YOU NEED TO LEARN        
 HOW TO CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS.  

288
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,343
   IRIS, COME HERE, SWEETIE.    

289
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,245
  - YOU WANT ME TO HIT A GIRL?  

290
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,780
     - HE WANTS YOU TO TRY.     

291
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,282
        - RELAX, BARRY.         

292
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,416
     I'VE HAD HER IN GLOVES     
       SINCE SHE WAS SIX.       

293
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,819
 SHE'S TOUGHER THAN SHE LOOKS.  

294
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:53,298
        - SORRY, BARRY.         

295
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,067
            - SON...            

296
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,338
   SOMETIMES THE BEST WAY TO    
WIN A FIGHT IS NOT TO START ONE,

297
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,874
         BUT IF YOU DO          
    COME UP AGAINST SOMEBODY    

298
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,676
            YOU KNOW            
   YOU CAN'T BEAT, BE SMART.    

299
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,578
        IT'S OKAY TO RUN        
         THE OTHER WAY.         

300
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,146
           ALL RIGHT?           

301
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,481
    - SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?     

302
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,686
 - JUDGING BY THE MUD AND KEGS  
    I'D SAY HE GOT HAMMERED,    

303
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,187
     STOLE A BIG-ASS TRUCK,     

304
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,622
      AND WENT JOYRIDING.       

305
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,357
I BET THE KEGS ARE STOLEN, TOO. 

306
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,626
  RUSTY IRON ALE, IT'S A MICRO  
     BREWED RIGHT OVER IN--     

307
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,161
 - KEYSTONE, I KNOW THE PLACE.  

308
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,331
      LET'S CHECK IT OUT.       
            - YEAH.             

309
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:42,914
  - BARRY DESCRIBED A TORNADO   
  OF RED AND YELLOW LIGHTNING   

310
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,550
    INSIDE A MAN IN YELLOW.     

311
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,085
           THEN, BAM.           

312
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,653
HE'S BLOCKS AWAY ON THE STREET. 

313
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,355
 DOESN'T KNOW HOW HE GOT THERE. 

314
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,956
        WHEN I ARRIVED,         
     THE PLACE WAS A WRECK.     

315
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,224
     - NORA ALLEN IS DEAD.      

316
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,859
      - SINGLE STAB WOUND       
         TO THE HEART.          

317
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,794
          HENRY ALLEN           
     COVERED IN HER BLOOD.      

318
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,963
 - AND DESPITE ALL THE EVIDENCE 
  THAT HENRY ALLEN IS GUILTY,   

319
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:03,601
  NOW YOU BELIEVE THIS--WHAT,   
 MAN IN YELLOW IS RESPONSIBLE?  

320
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,103
   - LAST NIGHT, I SAW BARRY    

321
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,205
       RESCUE A YOUNG BOY       
      FROM BEING RUN OVER,      

322
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,541
AND IT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE WHAT 
BARRY DESCRIBED HAPPENED TO HIM.

323
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,277
      IT GOT ME THINKING,       

324
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,881
 WHAT IF SOMEBODY WITH BARRY'S  
     ABILITIES KILLED NORA?     

325
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,716
    - THERE'S ONE FLAW WITH     
 YOUR THEORY THOUGH, DETECTIVE, 

326
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,520
    AND IS THAT ALL OF THIS     
     HAPPENED 14 YEARS AGO,     

327
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,922
     WHICH IS LONG BEFORE--     

328
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,456
   - YOUR MACHINE GAVE BARRY    
          HIS POWERS.           

329
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,058
    - AN ACCIDENT GAVE BARRY    
          HIS POWERS.           

330
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,727
 - DO YOU THINK IT IS POSSIBLE  

331
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,263
         THAT SOMEBODY          
    WITH BARRY'S SUPER-SPEED    

332
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,299
       COULD HAVE EXISTED       
     BEFORE THE EXPLOSION?      

333
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,435
      - DETECTIVE, I DEAL       
IN PROBABILITIES AS A SCIENTIST,

334
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,871
      AND IN THIS CASE...       

335
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,873
     IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY.      

336
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:52,717
       - GENTLEMEN, CCPD.       

337
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,118
           ANY CHANCE           
    SOME OF YOUR MERCHANDISE    

338
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,153
     WAS STOLEN LAST NIGHT?     

339
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,588
    - NO, I DON'T THINK SO.     

340
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,759
     - HOW ABOUT THIS GUY?      
         YOU SEEN HIM?          

341
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,197
  - YOU KNOW TONY, DON'T YOU?   

342
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,469
             - HEY.             

343
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,038
        ALLEN, COME ON!         

344
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,288
        ALLEN, YOU OKAY?        

345
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,323
      - OH, NEVER BETTER.       
           - GET UP.            

346
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,791
  - I DIDN'T DO NOTHING, MAN!   

347
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,193
      - SO WHY'D YOU RUN?       

348
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,695
  - LOOK, IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!   
          - WHAT WAS?           

349
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,031
     - TONY FALLING, OKAY?      

350
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,967
      BUT I SWEAR TO GOD,       
      WE DIDN'T KILL HIM!       

351
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,369
        - KEEP TALKING.         

352
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,205
    - ABOUT TEN MONTHS AGO,     
      KEYSTONE IRONWORKS.       

353
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,307
BOSS IS HANDING OUT PINK SLIPS. 

354
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,143
         TONY GETS HIS,         
      AND HE JUST SNAPPED.      

355
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,212
  HE STARTED BEATING THE CRAP   
        OUT OF THE GUY.         

356
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,181
       WE PULLED HIM OFF,       
 AND THEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.  

357
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,784
   SOME KIND OF POWER SURGE.    
         AND THEN TONY          

358
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,321
  WENT OVER THE RAILING RIGHT   
  INTO A VAT OF MOLTEN SCRAP.   

359
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,856
           JUST GONE.           

360
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,657
        - LUCKY FOR YOU         
       HE'S STILL ALIVE.        

361
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,893
            - WHAT?             

362
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,661
- HOW'D YOU GET IN FRONT OF US? 

363
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,663
          - SHORTCUT.           

364
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,902
   - ¶ WHEN I WAS JUST A BOY,   
          MY MAMA...¶           

365
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,439
- I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU, 
      WHERE'S YOUR SHADOW?      

366
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,840
         - WHAT SHADOW?         

367
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,676
            - BARRY.            
  HE HASN'T BEEN IN ALL WEEK.   

368
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,612
       - GETTING HIS FIX        
        SOMEWHERE ELSE.         

369
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,280
           - TOO BAD.           

370
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:33,284
   HE'S CUTE, I KIND OF MISS    
       HAVING HIM AROUND.       

371
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:37,922
            - IRIS?             
       LONG TIME NO SEE.        

372
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,901
        - I GOT TO SAY,         
    IRIS, YOU LOOK AMAZING.     

373
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,235
        - THANKS, TONY.         

374
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,371
          UM, YOU TOO.          

375
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,772
          - OH, YEAH.           
        I KEEP IN SHAPE.        

376
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,674
    I GOT A GYM AT MY PLACE.    

377
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,676
  BEEN LIVING OUT IN KEYSTONE   
       ON THE WEST SIDE,        

378
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,246
      AND YOU SHOULD, UH--      
  YOU SHOULD STOP BY SOMETIME.  

379
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,182
           - SO, UH,            
     CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?     

380
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,851
    - NO, I CAME TO SEE YOU.    

381
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,286
 - HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS HERE? 

382
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,088
     - I'VE BEEN READING UP     
         ON THE STREAK.         

383
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,056
    FOUND YOUR LITTLE BLOG.     

384
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,225
      WHY ARE YOU WRITING       
        ABOUT THIS GUY?         

385
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,961
 - PEOPLE SAY THAT HE'S A HERO. 

386
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,230
     - I SAY HE'S A COWARD,     

387
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,965
  AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT HE  
   TOOK A BEATING LAST NIGHT    

388
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,602
AND RAN OFF LIKE A LITTLE GIRL. 
  YOU SHOULD WRITE ABOUT THAT.  

389
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,172
      DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA      

390
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,641
      WHO LEATHER BOY IS?       

391
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,943
           - NO CLUE.           

392
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,945
            SO, UM,             
   IF YOU DON'T WANT A DRINK    

393
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,480
       I SHOULD PROBABLY        
       GET BACK TO WORK.        

394
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:39,083
- ACTUALLY I'D PREFER TO BUY YOU
            A DRINK.            

395
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,619
       WHAT TIME YOU OFF?       
        - THANKS, TONY,         

396
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,754
       BUT I DON'T THINK        
  MY BOYFRIEND WOULD APPROVE.   

397
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,057
    HE'S A COP, LIKE MY DAD.    

398
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,593
 - I NEVER REALLY DID LIKE COPS 
           TOO MUCH.            

399
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,795
            - IRIS!             

400
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:57,268
   - WELL HE'S PICKING ME UP    
   FOR THE POLICEMAN'S BALL.    

401
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,903
       WALL-TO-WALL COPS.       
       CAN'T SWING A CAT.       

402
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,072
     I SHOULD PROBABLY CALL     
    HIM TO SEE WHERE HE IS--    

403
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:04,509
   - GIVE ME THE PHONE, IRIS.   
              NOW!              

404
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:16,888
           I'M SORRY.           
      UH, FOR THE DAMAGE.       

405
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,958
       WE'LL PICK THIS UP       
        SOME OTHER TIME.        

406
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,061
      - [breathes heavily]      

407
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,003
            - BARRY!            
         CHECK IT OUT!          

408
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,372
           THE GRAVEL           
  YOU PULLED FROM TONY'S RIDE?  

409
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,407
  IT CONTAINS 76.8% HEMATITE.   

410
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,677
   CONSISTENT WITH THE MINES    
     AT KEYSTONE IRONWORKS.     

411
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,013
         - WHICH CLOSED         
      DOWN TEN MONTHS AGO.      

412
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,514
   IT'S THE PERFECT HIDEOUT.    

413
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,717
- BARRY, DO YOU MIND TELLING ME 
          ABOUT THIS?           

414
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,153
   "I HAVE INFO ABOUT SOMEONE   
      YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.       

415
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,388
         "HE WAS HERE.          

416
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,392
  YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME."   

417
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,795
      NOW WHO COULD SHE BE      
          TALKING TO?           

418
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:12,176
 - I GUESS YOU GOT MY MESSAGE.  

419
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,312
        - ARE YOU OKAY?         

420
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,981
       - COP'S DAUGHTER.        
      I CAN HANDLE MYSELF.      

421
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,749
      - NOT WITH THIS GUY.      

422
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,219
- I KNEW HIM WHEN WE WERE KIDS. 
   HE DIDN'T WANT TO HURT ME.   

423
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,820
    HE WANTED TO IMPRESS ME,    

424
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,489
   BUT HE IS FIXATED ON YOU,    
     AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.     

425
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,225
  - DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WENT?  

426
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,560
    - HE SAID HE HAD A PLACE    
     OUT IN WEST KEYSTONE.      

427
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,897
 BRAGGED ABOUT HOW BIG IT WAS,  
   BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE.    

428
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,967
            - I DO.             
- WAIT, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. 

429
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,235
           HIS HAND.            

430
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:41,472
         IT TRANSFORMED         
       LIKE AN IRON FIST.       

431
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,708
    HE'S LIKE YOU, ISN'T HE?    

432
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,712
  - YES, AND WRITING ABOUT ME   
  IS WHAT BROUGHT HIM TO YOU.   

433
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,080
           - I KNOW,            
    BUT MAYBE I COULD TALK--    

434
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,383
             - NO!              
      HE'S TOO DANGEROUS.       

435
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,685
      [knocking on glass]       

436
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,654
    - DAMN, THAT'S MY RIDE.     

437
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,689
  EDDIE INSISTED ON A DETAIL.   
            [whoosh]            

438
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,859
        I HAVE TO...GO.         

439
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:07,265
      - BARRY, TALK TO US.      
      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?       

440
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,470
    - DUDE, DON'T RUN ANGRY.    

441
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,606
         WE DON'T KNOW          
     HOW TO DEFEAT HIM YET.     

442
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:54,478
      - THIS IS DEFINITELY      
           THE PLACE.           

443
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,686
  - YOU'RE TRESPASSING, FREAK!  

444
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:05,856
  THERE'S NOWHERE LEFT TO RUN.  

445
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,932
            - BARRY?            
    - BARRY, WHERE ARE YOU?     

446
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,600
      CAITLIN, OVER HERE!       

447
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,770
            - BARRY?            
     PLEASE, SAY SOMETHING!     

448
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:23,874
         SAY SOMETHING          
    SO WE KNOW YOU'RE OKAY.     

449
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,978
             - OW.              
    - GET HIM OUT OF THERE!     

450
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,180
   - WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?    

451
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,815
    WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?     

452
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,050
           I TOLD YOU           
 THAT WE WOULD FIGURE OUT A WAY 

453
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,452
       TO DEAL WITH HIM.        
          - I'LL HEAL.          

454
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,020
        - YOU CAN'T HEAL        
       WHEN YOU'RE DEAD.        

455
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,288
   HE COULD HAVE KILLED YOU.    

456
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,824
      - I KNOW, ALL RIGHT?      
            I KNOW!             

457
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,326
      IN THE PAST 36 HOURS      
        I'VE HAD MY ASS         

458
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,129
 HANDED TO ME TWICE BY THE GUY  
   THAT TORTURED ME AS A KID.   

459
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,099
   I COULDN'T STOP HIM THEN,    
   AND I CAN'T STOP HIM NOW!    

460
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:50,668
      EVEN WITH MY POWERS       
I'M STILL POWERLESS AGAINST HIM.

461
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,870
       - NOT NECESSARILY.       

462
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,205
             CISCO?             

463
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,940
         ANY MATERIAL,          

464
00:22:55,942 --> 00:23:00,177
   IF STRUCK AT A HIGH ENOUGH   
  VELOCITY CAN BE COMPROMISED.  

465
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,280
    - WE RAN AN ANALYSIS ON     
 THE METAL IN TONY'S FOOTPRINT. 

466
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,616
      BASED ON ITS DENSITY      
     AND ATOMIC STRUCTURE,      

467
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,586
        IF YOU IMPACT IT        
    AT JUST THE RIGHT ANGLE,    

468
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:13,190
  AT JUST THE RIGHT SPEED, YOU  
 COULD DO SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.  

469
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,892
 - HOW FAST WOULD I HAVE TO GO? 

470
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,660
   - FACTORING IN THE METAL'S   
       TENSILE STRENGTH,        

471
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,498
  ESTIMATED DERMAL THICKNESS,   
ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, AIR TEMP, 

472
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,368
     YOU'D HAVE TO HIT HIM      
      AT APPROXIMATELY...       

473
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,704
           MACH 1.1.            

474
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,774
    - YOU WANT BARRY TO HIT     
SOMETHING AT 800 MILES AN HOUR? 

475
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,610
        - 837, ACTUALLY.        

476
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:33,844
 - THAT'S FASTER THAN THE SPEED 
           OF SOUND.            

477
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,212
           - I KNOW.            

478
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,047
 HE WOULD CREATE A SONIC BOOM,  

479
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,950
  WHICH, AS I'VE SAID BEFORE,   
       WOULD BE AWESOME.        

480
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,519
  - I'VE NEVER GONE THAT FAST.  

481
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,287
             - YET.             

482
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,257
- I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY
    ENTERTAINING THIS IDEA.     

483
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,226
       I MEAN, HE'D NEED        
A STRAIGHT SHOT FROM MILES AWAY 

484
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,896
       - YEAH, 5.3 MILES,       
         THEORETICALLY.         

485
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:56,600
         - DO IT RIGHT,         
     YOU'LL TAKE HIM DOWN.      

486
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,502
         - DO IT WRONG,         

487
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:02,740
   YOU'LL SHATTER EVERY BONE    
         IN YOUR BODY.          

488
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,779
            - BARRY.            

489
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,980
        - JOE, I'VE BEEN        
 BEATEN UP ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.  

490
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,116
           I GOTTA--            
          - HEY, WAIT.          

491
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:15,019
    AN ANONYMOUS TIP LED US     
  TO TONY WOODWARD'S HIDEOUT.   

492
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,787
     THE PLACE WAS TRASHED.     
         WHAT HAPPENED?         

493
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,789
    - HE SHOWS UP AT JITTERS    
          TO SEE IRIS.          

494
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,558
     I HAD TO GO AFTER HIM.     
     - IRIS, WHERE IS SHE?      

495
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,892
   - SHE'S FINE, SHE'S FINE.    

496
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,161
       EDDIE PUT A DETAIL       
       ON HER TO BE SAFE.       

497
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,263
       I THOUGHT I COULD        
     HANDLE HIM THIS TIME.      

498
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,731
            I TRIED.            

499
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,301
 - LOOK, I KNOW WHAT THIS PUNK  
        PUT YOU THROUGH,        

500
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,271
   BUT YOU CAN'T LET EMOTION    
      CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT.      

501
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,407
     - THE TOLLBOOTH CAMERA     
    GOT A SHOT OF WOODWARD.     

502
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,075
 STOLEN CAR HEADED OUT OF TOWN. 

503
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,578
 STATE POLICE ARE TAKING OVER.  

504
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
          WE LOST HIM.          
     - DON'T WORRY, EDDIE.      

505
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:43,848
        THEY'LL GET HIM.        

506
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,115
           - I WANTED           
     TO TAKE THIS GUY DOWN.     

507
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,451
  - NOT HALF AS MUCH AS I DID.  

508
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,086
       - LET'S GO, ALLEN.       

509
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,154
          - GO WHERE?           

510
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,222
     - BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.     

511
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,624
    I NEED TO HIT SOMETHING.    
            - WHAT?             

512
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,092
    - I DON'T THINK HE MEANT    
            HIT YOU.            

513
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,428
              GO.               

514
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:09,306
   - SO I HEARD YOU AND THIS    
  WOODWARD GUY HAVE A HISTORY.  

515
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,808
          HEY, ALLEN.           

516
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,543
           IT'S OKAY.           
           TRUST ME.            

517
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,745
 I HAD MY FAIR SHARE OF BULLIES 
           AT SCHOOL.           

518
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:17,081
     - YEAH, SOMEHOW I FIND     
     THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.      

519
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:21,485
      - I WAS SHORT, FAT,       
  AND THE SON OF A POLITICIAN   

520
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,420
     WHO CLOSED THE FACTORY     
     IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT,     

521
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,991
       SO NOT SO POPULAR.       

522
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,662
  - SO WHAT'D YOU DO ABOUT IT?  

523
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,731
     - I GOT MY ASS KICKED.     

524
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:39,003
   A LOT, UNTIL MY GYM COACH    
        TOOK PITY ON ME.        

525
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:41,672
        SHE SAID THE KEY        
    TO FIGHTING IS PATIENCE.    

526
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,674
             HERE.              

527
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:47,211
   A LOT OF GUYS WASTE ENERGY   
TRYING TO LAND THE MOST PUNCHES.

528
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:51,382
      ALL IT TAKES IS ONE,      
 BUT YOU GOT TO MAKE IT COUNT.  

529
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,585
        CHOOSE YOUR SPOT        
     AND DRIVE THROUGH IT,      

530
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:58,055
      LIKE IT'S SIX INCHES      
       BEHIND THE TARGET.       

531
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,264
            HARDER.             

532
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:14,138
            HARDER!             

533
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,944
            [coughs]            

534
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:24,381
           - THE SEAM           
     WAS STARTING TO SPLIT.     

535
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,716
           [chuckles]           

536
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,721
 - APPRECIATE YOU COMING DOWN.  

537
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:33,357
     - HMM, WELL THESE DAYS     
   IT'S RARE TO FIND SOMEONE    

538
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,594
 HAPPY TO HAVE A DRINK WITH ME. 

539
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:41,131
    - WELL, OUR CONVERSATION    
   YESTERDAY GOT ME THINKING.   

540
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,867
   YOU SAID, AS A SCIENTIST,    
   YOU LOOK FOR THE PROBABLE?   

541
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,235
        - THAT'S RIGHT.         

542
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,538
     - AND WE BOTH RECENTLY     
        HAVE SEEN THINGS        

543
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,741
      THAT HAVE REDEFINED       
       WHAT IS POSSIBLE.        

544
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,943
        - YES, WE HAVE,         
        AND WE BOTH KNOW        

545
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,111
        THE DIRECT CAUSE        
        OF THOSE THINGS.        

546
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,913
 - YOUR ACCELERATOR EXPLOSION.  

547
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,882
- EVOLUTIONARY LEAPS FOLLOW THE 
 CREATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.  

548
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,117
       IT'S THAT SIMPLE.        

549
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,520
       - LIKE THE ROOMBA.       
            [laughs]            

550
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:08,158
    - YES, LIKE THE ROOMBA.     

551
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,362
      - SO HUMOR ME HERE.       

552
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,997
             - HMM?             

553
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:17,668
 - IF WE KNOW THAT META-HUMANS  
          WERE CREATED          

554
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,537
  BY THE PARTICLE ACCELERATOR   
      AND TESTIMONY SHOWS       

555
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,173
THAT A META-HUMAN MAY HAVE BEEN 
     INVOLVED IN THE MURDER     

556
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:27,978
OF BARRY ALLEN'S MOTHER 14 YEARS
  AGO, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT...   

557
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,181
         WAY BACK THEN          
      THERE MUST HAVE BEEN      

558
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:36,186
            ANOTHER             
     PARTICLE ACCELERATOR.      

559
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,657
- ANOTHER PARTICLE ACCELERATOR? 
             - HMM.             

560
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,292
   - I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT'S    
 EXTREMELY UNLIKELY, DETECTIVE, 

561
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,763
AND IF THEY WERE I DON'T RECALL 
ANY DARK MATTER LIGHTNING STORMS

562
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,431
    BEFORE I MOVED TO TOWN.     

563
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,467
            DO YOU?             

564
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:55,839
       - NO, NO, I DON'T.       

565
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,543
   WHEN DID YOU MOVE TO TOWN,   
           DR. WELLS?           

566
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,888
      - SOMETHING TELLS ME      
THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER

567
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,523
  TO THAT QUESTION, DETECTIVE.  

568
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:17,861
   THIS WHOLE "HELP ME SOLVE    
   THE MURDER OF NORA ALLEN,"   

569
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,531
         YOU WERE NEVER         
 LOOKING FOR MY HELP, WERE YOU? 

570
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:25,002
 - YOU OPENED YOUR LAB A MONTH  
   AFTER NORA ALLEN'S MURDER.   

571
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:26,737
   WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME    
      WHAT YOU WERE DOING       

572
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,441
  IN CENTRAL CITY BEFORE THAT?  

573
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,345
     - I WAS STARTING OVER.     

574
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:39,583
     - STARTING WHAT OVER?      

575
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:43,053
        - HERE I THOUGHT        
     WE WERE JUST TWO GUYS      

576
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,222
    HAVING A FRIENDLY DRINK.    

577
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,657
  YOU WANT ANSWERS, DETECTIVE?  

578
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,692
   TESS MORGAN, LOOK HER UP.    

579
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,933
          - [exhales]           

580
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,606
  - UNIT 52, THIS IS DISPATCH.  

581
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,942
    REQUESTING STATUS UPDATE    
       ON THE WEST HOUSE.       

582
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,777
             - UNH!             

583
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,757
          - HEY, IRIS.          

584
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:30,601
         - NICE, ALLEN.         
            - YEAH.             

585
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,136
          - ALL RIGHT.          
            - OKAY.             

586
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,670
        - HEY, NEXT TIME        
      WORK ON YOUR SPEED.       

587
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:36,907
    - YEAH, I'LL DO MY BEST.    

588
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,243
        - THAWNE, ALLEN.        

589
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,345
    THE UNIT WATCHING JOE'S     
DAUGHTER, THEY'VE BEEN ATTACKED.

590
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,014
        IRIS IS MISSING.        

591
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:48,752
        - GO, ALL RIGHT?        
         I'LL CALL JOE.         

592
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,922
- LET'S ADJUST THE IMPACT ANGLE 
         BY .2 DEGREES,         

593
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,324
      UP THE SPEED TO 838.      

594
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:58,395
              BAM.              

595
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,064
             OUCH.              
            - OUCH?             

596
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,132
       - GUYS, YOU THERE?       

597
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,634
    - YEAH, MAN, WHAT'S UP?     

598
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,269
       - TONY TOOK IRIS.        

599
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,670
 I NEED YOU TO DO WHATEVER YOU  
    CAN TO HELP ME FIND HER.    

600
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,305
           ALL RIGHT?           
 SATELLITES, SECURITY CAMERAS.  

601
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,274
         HACK 'EM ALL.          
         - WE'RE ON IT.         

602
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,413
        - WHAT'S WRONG?         

603
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,189
  - REMEMBER THIS PLACE, IRIS?  

604
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,591
   - SO WHAT'S THE PLAN HERE,   
             TONY?              

605
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,626
       YOU FINALLY GONNA        
       GO FOR THAT G.E.D?       

606
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,261
       - YOU WANT A PLAN?       
          HOW'S THIS?           

607
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,596
       YOU USED TO WRITE        
    ABOUT THE STREAK, RIGHT?    

608
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,464
     NOW YOU'RE GONNA WRITE     
           ABOUT ME.            

609
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,466
 - YOU JUST ABDUCTED ME, TONY.  
      WHY WOULD I DO THAT?      

610
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,736
 - BECAUSE THE STREAK IS DEAD.  

611
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,271
             - NO.              

612
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,007
  - SQUASHED LIKE A LITTLE BUG  
             BY ME.             

613
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,609
      SO IF YOU DON'T WANT      
THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

614
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,077
          YOU'RE GONNA          
      TELL THE WHOLE WORLD      

615
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,980
   THAT THERE'S A NEW BIG MAN   
           ON CAMPUS!           

616
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,583
 AND I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.  

617
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,984
        - YOU COULD HAVE        
 ANYBODY WRITE ABOUT YOU, TONY. 

618
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,853
            WHY ME?             

619
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:59,289
   - 'CAUSE I LIKE YOU, IRIS.   
          ALWAYS HAVE.          

620
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:07,030
     - YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID     
           SOMETHING.           

621
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:08,332
      [fire alarm blaring]      

622
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:10,467
       - YOU TRY ANYTHING       
        LIKE THAT AGAIN         

623
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:14,571
      AND I'M GONNA LEAVE       
      MORE THAN A BRUISE!       

624
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,640
     - EDDIE, ANYTHING YET?     

625
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,675
      - WE HAVE ROADBLOCKS      
     ON EVERY MAJOR ARTERY.     

626
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,244
      UNITS ARE SEARCHING.      

627
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,813
   - WE WILL FIND IRIS, JOE.    

628
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:29,720
       - YOU DON'T THINK        
    HE'LL HURT HER, DO YOU?     

629
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:33,223
- SIR, SIR, WE GOT A FIRE ALARM 
 CALL AT CARMICHAEL ELEMENTARY. 

630
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,525
- DISPATCH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. 
 WE'LL SEND BACKUP WHEN WE CAN. 

631
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,960
      - THAT'S THE SCHOOL       
     YOU AND IRIS WENT TO.      

632

      - NO, I WANT YOU TO.      

758
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,246
 NO, I MEAN, I WANT--YOU CAN--  

759
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,748
       I WANT YOU TO TALK       

760
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,015
   ABOUT WHATEVER YOU'D WANT    
         TO TALK ABOUT.         

761
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,350
 I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.  

762
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,886
    - GOOD BECAUSE IT'S NOT     
        JUST THE STREAK.        

763
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,689
   THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE   
       THAT ARE LIKE HIM.       

764
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:55,525
  I'VE GOTTEN SCATTERED POSTS   
 ABOUT THIS GUY THAT'S ON FIRE, 

765
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,260
EXCEPT THAT HE DOESN'T BURN UP. 

766
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,828
        - OKAY, SO WAIT.        
             WAIT.              

767
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,332
     YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND      
    THE BURNING MAN NOW TOO?    

768
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,100
        - YEAH, WHY NOT?        
    I MEAN, A LOT CAN HAPPEN    

769
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,502
           IN A WEEK,           
  ESPECIALLY WITH THE STREAK.   

770
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,404
             - HEH.             

771
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,205
     - I'VE BEEN TRYING TO      
     GET ANSWERS FROM HIM.      

772
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,840
    WHERE DOES HE COME FROM?    
  HOW DOES HE DO WHAT HE DOES?  

773
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,342
   BUT HE DODGES EVERYTHING.    

774
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:16,679
           LITERALLY,           
  WITH THIS SUPER-SPEED POWER.  

775
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,350
     WHEN HE MOVES, BARRY,      
    YOU DON'T EVEN SEE HIM.     

776
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,352
       HE COMES AND GOES        
    IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE,     

777
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:25,889
             IN A--             
            - FLASH?            

778
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:32,662
         - IN A FLASH.          

779
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:40,103
             YEAH.              

780
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,608
     TODAY, I WAS SAVED BY      
        THE IMPOSSIBLE.         

781
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,045
         A MYSTERY MAN.         
     THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE.     

782
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:53,349
 THEN A FRIEND GAVE ME AN IDEA  
        FOR A NEW NAME,         

783
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:58,354
     AND SOMETHING TELLS ME     
      IT'S GONNA CATCH ON.      

784
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:27,650
      [power shutting off]      

785
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:36,125
        [glass shatters]        

786
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,143
    - GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
