这个人先带着狼和白菜过河

我不会为我的过去道歉

我没想让你道歉  你没听我说

134
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,060
不  是你没听我说

135
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,070
我不是想让你撒手不管
I'm not asking you to walk away from this.

136
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,870
是吗  听起来你就是这个意思
Really? Because it sounds like you are.

137
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,210
我们一直这么兜圈子
And we keep going around and around

138
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,480
我反复告诉你我别无选择
and I keep telling you that I don't have a choice.

这里的法律和罪行

142
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,130
都像迷宫一样纠缠在一起
twisted up at each other like a maze.

143
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,800
我来这儿是想当警察
I came here to be a cop.

144
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,460
但这城市需要的是别的什么
This city needs something else.

145
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,590
没关系
So, okay...

146

147
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,740

让我帮你分担一半

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,260
天知道  你已经承担了我的一半包袱
God knows I've... I've dumped my half on you and you carry it.

150
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,680
芭芭拉  我接触的事非常危险
Barbara, what I'm dealing with, it's so dangerous...

151
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,630
只要
Half...

152
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,060
帮你分担一半
of what you carry.

153
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,310
你要是觉得我会怕
If you think I care about the risk,

154
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,360
那你是忘记我是谁了
then you're forgetting who I am.

155
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,720
我发誓我记得
I swear I'm not.

156
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,690
我们没事了吧
Are we okay?

157
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,580
还在吵架吗
Are we still fighting?

158
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,580
我们在谈判
We're negotiating terms.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,350
这对我不利啊
That's not good for me.

160
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,760
你告诉我你在对付谁
You tell me what you're up against.

161
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,860
好吗
Okay?

162
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,390
对我敞开心扉
You let me in.

163
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,060
那我们就没事了
Then we're okay.

164
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,460
-又是工作  -猜就是
- That's work again. - Yep.

165
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,920
我会告诉你全部
I'll tell you everything.

166
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,490
我能告诉的都告诉你  好吗
Everything I can. Okay?

167
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,280
-我会弥补的  -好
- I'll make it right. - Okay.

168
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,250
那里就有一个
There's the one, right there.

169
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,720
我们在河边排查好几天了  蒙托
We've been canvassing this waterfront for days, Monty.

170
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,360
河边流浪汉不会帮我们的
None of these river rats are gonna help us.

171
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,850
24小时内再没线索
We don't get a lead in the next 24 hours,

172
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,090
重案组就要撤案了
MCU is dropping this.

173
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,350
我都残废了6个月了
I'm on the disability six months.

174
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,660
你指望我去哪
Where do you expect me to go?

175
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,050
我们不是要赶你  老家伙
We're not flushing you, old-timer. Okay?

176
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,260
只是想问几个问题
Just want to ask you some questions.

177
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,470
关于前不久发生在那边码头的枪击案
Yeah, about a shooting that took place  recently on that pier back there.

178
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,540
枪击案吗
A shooting?

179
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,370
我看得可清楚了
I saw it good.

180
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,460
好的  太好了  你见过这男人吗
Okay... uh, great. You-you ever this man?

181
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,560
这就是开枪的那个
That was the man did the shooting.

182
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,330
冷血啊  那个男人
A cold customer, that man.

183
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,350
血管里流的是冰
Ice floating in the veins.

184
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,340
我们抓住那个混蛋了
We got the son of a bitch.

185
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,430
我们抓住戈登了
We got Gordon.

186
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,750
"哥谭山羊"
"Gotham Goat"?

187
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,910
是个崇拜者
A wannabe.

188
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,790
作为一个模仿犯  这模仿真是...
For a copycat, the copy is... ugh.

189
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,030
真是超级诡异
Downright creepy, is what it is.

190
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,740
你是接了私活还是怎么的
You moonlighting or something?

191
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,700
我吗
Me?

192
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,030
是啊  因为你迟到了
Yeah. 'Cause you're late

193
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,360
而且看起来萎靡不振的
and you look like crap warmed over.

194
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,730
想的话去打我小报告啊
Write me up if you want.

195
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,030
去你的  模范生
Screw you, Boy Scout.

196
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,270
你心情不错啊
You're in a good mood.

197
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,840
这就是令人反胃的"昨日重现"
I'm in a déjà vu acid flashback.

198
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,070
有人在追杀哥谭的富二代
Someone's hunting the kids of Gotham's top one percent,

199
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,600
媒体肯定得乐疯了
the press will have a field day,

200
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,680
整个城市翻天覆地
city turns upside down,

201
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,630
而整件事都会狠狠地压在哥谭市警局身上
the whole thing's gonna come down on the GCPD like a ton of bricks.

202
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,480
那我们就快点抓到他
Well, then, let's catch him quick.

203
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,160
我认为凶手应该认识死者阿曼达・黑斯廷斯
I'm guessing the killer knew the victim, Amanda Hastings, somehow.

204
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,040
我们去调查一下她家庭
We'll go see the family,

205
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,670
看看能不能找到什么可查的线索
see if we can try to get something we can work with.

206
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,240
还有  尼格玛...
And, Nygma...

207
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,040
他们准备尸检的时候告诉我一声
let me know when they're set up for the autopsy, all right?

208
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,690
要我特别留意什么吗
Anything in particular you want me to look out for?

209
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,000
打给我就是了
Just call me.

210
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,510
你瞧  奇怪的是
You see, the strange thing,

211
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,500
可怕的是
the horrible thing,

212
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,570
我几周以来一直在做一样的梦
is that I've been having the same dream for weeks.

213
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,450
梦见一个黑暗的
Of a dark,

214
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,300
令人喘不过气来的东西
overbearing presence.

215
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,150
黑斯廷斯先生  关于您女儿
Mr. Hastings, about your daughter--

216
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,510
我们知道这很不容易  但是...
and we know that this is difficult-- but...

217
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,290
她生活中有什么人让您觉得担心吗
did she have anyone in her life that worried you?

218
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,340
有什么人会想伤害她吗
Anyone who might have wished her harm?

219
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,100
大家都喜欢阿曼达
Everybody loved my Amanda.

220
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,680
黑斯廷斯先生  您还好吗
Mr. Hastings, are... are you all right?

221
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,620
罗伯特  假如你想休息一会儿
Robert, if you need to take a moment,

222
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,060
应该不会碍事的
I'm sure it'll be all right.

223
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,710
当然了
Absolutely.

224
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,530
来吧
Come on.

225
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,080
我知道二位在争分夺秒地破案
I know you gentlemen are working against the clock,

226
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,030
但恐怕黑斯廷斯先生和夫人
but I'm afraid Mr. And Mrs. Hastings

227
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,690
还没做好这个准备
might not be ready for this.

228
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,240
看得出来
I can see that.

229
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,020
您是黑斯廷斯家的心理医生吗  马科斯医生
And you are the Hastings' family therapist, Dr. Marks?

230
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,210
是的  我主要治疗黑斯廷斯先生
Yes, I treat mostly Mr. Hastings,

231
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,260
但我们也进行多次家庭心理咨询
but we've had many family sessions.

232
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,100
黑斯廷斯先生非常...
Mr. Hastings has a very...

233
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,220
敏感脆弱
delicate nature.

234
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,660
恐怕他完全不能够
I'm afraid he's not at all capable

235
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,200
面对这样的惨剧
of dealing with this kind of tragedy.

236
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,400
没有人能够面对这样的惨剧
No one's capable of dealing with this kind of tragedy.

237
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,980
这就像辆货运火车
It's a freight train.

238
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,620
从你身上碾过去
It runs you over.

239
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,990
你只能尽力捡起残肢断臂
And you try to pick up what's left.

240
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,010
你不相信心理治疗
You don't believe in treatment.

241
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,600
我相信你用来麻痹黑斯廷斯夫人的安定剂
I believe in the tranquilizers you clobbered Mrs. Hastings with.

242
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,900
假如你给我们份样本...
And if you're giving out samples...

243
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,060
行了...
Okay, uh...

244
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,600
警探  也许我们应该...
Detective, maybe we should, uh...

245
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,250
对  你说得对  没错
Yeah, you're right, we should.

246
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,670
失陪了
Excuse me.

247
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,430
谢谢您  医生
Thank you, Doctor.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,540
{\an8}资料室

249
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,480
好的  明白了
All right, got it...

250
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,510
明白了
and got it.

251
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,590
好的  长官  我马上把那些文件拿过去
Yes, sir, I'll bring those files right away.

252
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,030
尼格玛先生
Mr. Nygma.

253
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,900
你好  柯林格小姐
Hello, Miss Kringle.

254
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,490
我需要你这里所有
So, I'm just looking for all the

255
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,930
关于十年前山羊杀人案的资料
information you have on the Goat Murders from ten years ago.

256
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,610
你不好奇吗
Don't you find it curious?

257
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,890
为什么有人要重演这种老掉牙的怪物杀人谜案
Why someone would resurrect the myth of a centuries-old bogeyman.

258
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,080
而且山羊有什么特别之处
And what is it about the Goat

259
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,740
竟有两个不同的人以它之名杀人
that has made two separate people decide to kill in his name?

260
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,510
我一点都不好奇
No, I-I don't find it curious.

261
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,280
我觉得我会喜欢你父母的
I think I would like your parents.

262
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,290
你说什么
Excuse me?

263
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,170
柯林格  多少见的姓啊
Kringle, such a rare surname.

264
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,280
大多数人会因为觉得丢人
Most people changed it generations ago,

265
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,510
早在几代之前就改换姓氏
out of embarrassment.

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,490
你父母不仅保留了这样一个姓
Not only did your parents keep it;

267
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,030
还把你的名字取作  柯丽丝汀
they called you "Kristin."

268
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,430
柯丽丝汀・柯林格
"Kristin Kringle."

269
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,720
他们一定都是幽默感十足的人
They must be very humorous people.

270
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,920
幽默是一种非常重要的品质  你说是吧
Humor is so important, don't you think?

271
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,400
取走任何证据都要记得签字
Remember you have to sign out any evidence you pull.

272
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,090
你这里怎么找东西啊
How do you find anything at all in here?

273
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,340
从组织学的角度讲
I mean, organizationally speaking,

274
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,350
这地方简直一团糟啊
this place is a shambles.

275
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,290
我警告你  尼格玛
I am warning you, Nygma.

276
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,470
这地方我整理得很妥当
I have this exactly as I want it.

277
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,070
我对这里了如指掌
I know where everything is.

278
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,670
明白吗
Understand?

279
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,230
非常明白
Preternaturally.

280
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,690
但...
But...

281
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,860
我可以帮你  柯丽丝汀・柯林格
I can help you, Kristin Kringle.

282
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,550
对此我很是怀疑
I doubt that very much.

283
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,600
这里可以变得更好的
There's a much better way to do this.

284
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,830
阿曼达・黑斯廷斯最后一次出现就是进入这幢大楼
Amanda Hastings was last seen entering this building--

285
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,720
周二的午夜
Tuesday, midnight.

286
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,460
大概是36小时前
That's about 36 hours ago.

287
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,330
你觉得她就是从这里被绑架走的
You think she was abducted from here?

288
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,290
不知道  十年前米奇的作案手法就是这样
I don't know. That was Milkie's M.O. ten years ago.

289
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,280
把被害人分别从家中劫走
He took each one of the victims from their homes.

290
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,340
但犯罪现场调查组没有发现闯入的迹象
But CSI found no signs of a break-in.

291
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,760
当年兰道尔案也是这样
They didn't with Randall, either.

292
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,550
他当时所在的空调维修队
He worked for an air-conditioning maintenance crew

293
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,340
正好负责那三栋大楼
that covered all three buildings.

294
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,490
他有钥匙吗
He had keys?

295
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,570
没错
He had keys.

296
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,760
我是戈登警探
This is Detective Gordon.

297
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,100
给我一份能进入
I need the employee list

298
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,990
黑斯廷斯家大楼的所有维修
of every maintenance and janitorial company

299
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,090
和管理公司的完整职员名单
with access to the Hastings' building.

300
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,260
我会转告他的
Yeah, I'll tell him.

301
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,730
他们准备验尸了
They're ready for the autopsy.

302
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,040
妈妈
Mother!

303
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,680
我等了这么久
I wait for so long,

304
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,960
他总算回来敲门了
and now he scratches at the door,

305
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,660
我的小野猫
the filthy tomcat.

306
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,540
妈妈
Hi, Mom.

307
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,180
我还活着呢
I'm alive.

308
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,470
你为什么总觉得
I don't know why you always think

309
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,530
我是跟什么俗艳的女人跑了
I'm running off with some painted lady.

310
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,180
我都不约会
I don't even date.

311
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,280
那为什么这么久都不给妈妈来个电话
Why you don't call your mother in all this time?

312
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,970
我来说吧
I tell you why.

313
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,440
你就是被什么放荡女人给勾住了
You got tangled in some hussy's demon-purse!

314
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,500
妈妈  没什么女人
Mother, there was no hussy.

315
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,500
只有背叛  暴虐  以及...
Only betrayal and savagery and...

316
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,080
我只是想获得一丝尊重
All I wanted was a little respect.

317
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,720
他们却伤害了我
And they hurt me.

318
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,460
十分残忍
So cruelly.

319
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,750
原来真的没有什么女人
There was no other woman.

320
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,000
我去鬼门关走了一遭  他们想杀了我
I have been to hell and back. They tried to kill me.

321
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,430
又是那些恶霸吗
The bullies again?

322
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,430
我可怜的小心肝啊
My poor, poor darling.

323
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,060
他们这么做都是出于憎恨
They only do these things because they resent you.

324
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,730
嫉妒  厌恶
Envy and spite.

325
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,480
就是这样的
That's all it is.

326
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,630
等着瞧吧  妈妈
You watch, Mom.

327
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,740
我会成为这城里的大人物
I'm gonna be somebody in this town.

328
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,930
我一直都知道
I always knew this.

329
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,060
被害人死于窒息  很可能是乙醚或氯仿
Victim was asphyxiated, likely with ether or chloroform.

330
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,650
检查头皮底下
Look under the scalp.

331
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,060
听我的
Humor me.

332
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,340
在颅底部位
At the base of the skull

333
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,080
应该有个2厘米左右的切口
will be an incision, about an inch long.

334
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,790
缝合好的
Sewn closed.

335
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,450
等等  没错
Wait a minute. Yes.

336
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,860
我居然没注意到
How did I miss that?

337
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,360
有个缝合好的切口
An incision stitched closed,

338
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,180
就在枕骨附近
near the occipital.

339
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,510
里面还缝着异物
Over a foreign object.

340
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,100
什么东西
What is it?

341
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,290
一美分
It's a penny.

342
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,340
他说的没错
He's right.

343
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:37,380
一美分
A penny?

344
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,230
这是兰道尔・米奇的作案手法
Randall Milkie's M.O.

345
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
不可能有人知道这个细节
No one could know that detail.

346
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,430
凶手不是模仿犯
It isn't a copycat.

347
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,140
不可能的
It can't be.

348
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,890
10年前  兰道尔・米奇
Ten years ago, Randall Milkie took

349
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,710
把跟这枚一模一样的1813版美分
an 1813 Liberty penny just like this one

350
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,290
缝进了每个被害人的脑袋里
and sewed it into the heads of each one of his victims.

351
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,120
为什么
Why?

352
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,850
我怎么知道
How the hell do I know?

353
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,300
他袭击了我  脑袋上还带着兽角
He bum-rushed me wearing animal horns.

354
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,080
我打死了他  没来得及聊硬币收藏
I shot him. We didn't talk coin collecting.

355
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,350
你确定没有其他人知道这事
And you're sure no one else could have found this out?

356
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,000
米奇完全就是个独行侠
Milkie was the definition of a loner.

357
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,640
他绝不会告诉别人的
He didn't tell anybody.

358
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,490
我们在报告里也特意略去了这点
We left it out of the file intentionally.

359
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,620
你隐瞒证据
You suppressed evidence.

360
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,720
这叫彩蛋
We "easter-egged" it.

361
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,590
我们认为山羊杀手这样的人
We figured a killer like the Goat would have a good chance

362
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,390
很容易招引崇拜者
of drawing admirers.

363
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,300
没错  这是模仿犯的最爱
Yeah, it's copycat porn.

364
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,310
我们隐瞒了这个细节
We left out this one detail.

365
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,940
硬币的事从未见报
The coins, it never hit the papers.

366
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,610
这只山寨羊到底怎么知道的
How the hell did this copy-Goat know about this?

367
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,320
好吧  就算你隐瞒了此事
Okay, so you hid it.

368
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,490
但验尸官总会知道吧
But the medical examiner, he had to know.

369
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,010
艾德・海耶斯  确实
Ed Hayes. Yeah, sure.

370
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,620
不过他已经死于肝硬化了
But he died of cirrhosis.

371
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,990
所以只剩下我
That just leaves me.

372
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,260
和狄克斯
And Dix.

373
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,770
警监  拜托  他根本没理由...
Captain, please, there's no reason...

374
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,020
去跟他聊聊
Go talk to him.

375
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,660
确保他没和别人提过硬币的事
Make sure he didn't tell anyone about the coins.

376
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,910
干脆问问他有什么想法
Hell, see if he's got any ideas.

377
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,100
我是蕾西・怀特
I'm Lacey White,

378
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,950
欢迎收看哥谭7频道山羊杀手追踪报道
and this is the Gotham 7 Goat Watch.

379
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,510
今夜  哥谭的上流社会将要在模仿犯杀手的
Tonight, Gotham's wealthiest one percent rests fitfully

380
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:01,480
死亡阴影中战战兢兢了
under a copycat killer's deadly shadow.

381
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,800
如果您恰好是上流社会富贵家族的一员
And if you happen to be one of the city's high-society silver spoons,

382
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,800
那您大概正赶往瑞士阿尔卑斯山避风头呢
then you're probably headed to the Swiss Alps right now...

383
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,840
杀手把大家吓得不轻
They've got them all running like rabbits.

384
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,200
是啊
Yeah.

385
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,250
我不懂他为什么要选个蹄类动物作图腾  但是
I don't know why he chose an ungulate for his totem, but...

386
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,350
他真会吓唬他们
he does know how to scare them, though.

387
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,910
你知道你也是"他们"中的一员吧  布鲁斯少爷
You do realize you happen to be one of "Them," don't you, Master Bruce?

388
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,820
哥谭有钱有势的家庭的长子
Yeah, firstborn son of Gotham's rich and powerful.

389
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,360
也许你该暂时离开这儿
I don't know, maybe you should leave town for a little bit.

390
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,440
去湖边小屋住一段时间
Pop down to the lake house.

391
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,700
你很喜欢那里  不是吗
You like it there, don't you?

392
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,970
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

393
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,910
我还有事要做
I have work to do.

394
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,380
再说了
Besides...

395
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,010
山羊杀手何必要绑架我呢
why would the Goat take me?

396
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,570
反正这家就剩我一个了
There's no one to take me from.

397
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,960
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

398
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,620
我在升级你的系统
I'm improving your system.

399
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,910
施行根茎式参照索引
Implementing a rhizomatic cross-index,

400
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,690
把你的案卷按主题分类
with your case files classified by subject,

401
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,230
但是排列成类似泥煤苔有机体的生长方式
but arranged more like the way a peat moss organism grows.

402
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,040
就是横向生长
You know, laterally.

403
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,450
这个房间我整理得很好
I had this entire room organized.

404
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,410
是啊  但现在会像根茎一样
Yes, but now it will be rhizomatic.

405
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,430
横向散开
Lateral.

406
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,880
我到底对你做了什么  尼格玛
What did I ever do to you, Nygma?

407
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,530
你为什么非要来这里
What did I do that compels you to come here

408
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,760
没完没了地指手画脚  提建议和出谜语
with your endless notes and suggestions and riddles?

409
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,870
我的天呐  那些谜语
My God, the riddles!

410
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,490
你是想逼我辞职吗
Are you trying to get me to quit?

411
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,230
你不可能想抢我的工作
You can't want my job.

412
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,970
不不不  我要的是你...
No, no, no! I want you.

413
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,470
保住你的工作
To... keep your job

414
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,230
并且好好干  在这里
and to have it. Here.

415
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,690
工作
For working.

416
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,950
我有点觉得
Okay, I'm getting the sense

417
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,740
我的做法似乎不太恰当
that this was somehow inappropriate.

418
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,240
你好奇怪
You are so odd.

419
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,220
我这就把我的非分层数据范式拿走
I'll just take my nonhierarchical data paradigms out of your hair...

420
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,450
让你继续工作
and leave you to your work.

421
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,490
你和这人多久没见过了
How long has it been since you've seen this guy?

422
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,290
布洛克  我知道是怎么回事
Look, Bullock, I know what happened.

423
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,750
任何处在那种情况下的人...
Anybody in your situation...

424
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,900
你以为你能给我当心理医生吗  模范生
Listen, you think you can shrink my head, Boy Scout?

425
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,990
你不能
Because you can't.

426
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,020
我这是黑箱
This is the black box, man.

427
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,860
不能打开  绝对不打开
And we don't open the black box. Ever.

428
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,890
好吧
Okay, fine.

429
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,130
你先去那边坐下
So, why don't you sit your ass down?

430
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,630
我马上就回来
I'll be back in a few minutes.

431
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,780
我们在一起查案
We're both on this case.

432
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,650
狄克斯
Dix.

433
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,950
看看是谁来了
What do we have here?

434
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:56,490
哈维・布洛克  青年干探
Harvey Bullock, boy detective.

435
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,800
瞧瞧你啊
Look at you up there, huh?

436
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,340
享受着高品质的生活
Living the high life.

437
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,240
瞧瞧我
And me down here,

438
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,560
身体不支  肝脏受损
all broken up with a busted liver.

439
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,100
别把这算我头上  老头子
Don't put that on me, old man.

440
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,430
你受损的肝脏是你的酗酒造成的
Your bum liver's between you and the bottle.

441
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,480
我只是害你断了腿  让你坐上了轮椅
I just busted up your gams and put you in that chair.

442
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,730
哥谭的金科玉律
Gotham's Golden Rule.

443
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,810
不出英雄  布洛克
No heroes, Bullock.

444
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,860
不出英雄
No heroes.

445
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,520
听我说  狄克斯
Listen, Dix.

446
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,080
我们得谈谈那起案子
We have to talk about the case.

447
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,070
山羊杀手
About the Goat.

448
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,910
我还在想你什么时候会来向我求助呢
I was wondering when you were going to come and ask for my help.

449
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,110
我不是来求助的
I'm not asking for your help.

450
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,600
那不代表你不需要
That don't mean you don't need it.

451
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,030
他是什么人
Who's this?

452
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,370
你的搭档吗
Your partner?

453
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,050
我叫詹姆斯・戈登  很高兴认识你
James Gordon. Nice to meet you.

454
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:38,990
言归正传  狄克斯
Come on, Dix.

455
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,040
你有和任何人提起过兰道尔・米奇吗
You ever tell anyone about Randall Milkie?

456
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,270
那些美分硬币
The Liberty head pennies?

457
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,300
我们说好不提起此事  把事瞒住的
We said we weren't going to. We sealed them.

458
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,650
我当然知道  你个蠢货
I know we sealed them, you jackass!

459
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,870
是我叫你这么做的
I told you to seal them.

460
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,610
但是这个新杀手的作案手法一模一样
Okay, but this new killer's doing the same thing.

461
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,790
他把硬币缝在被害人的脑袋里
He's stitching up coins in the heads of his victims.

462
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,640
知道他是怎么想出来的吗
Any idea how he came up with that?

463
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,710
我没和任何人说过
I didn't tell anybody.

464
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,420
艾德・海耶斯没和任何人说过
Ed Hayes didn't tell nobody.

465
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,240
你也没和任何人说过
And you didn't tell nobody.

466
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,990
那这说明什么
So, what the hell does that mean?

467
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,270
说明我们对米奇的看法是错的
It means we were wrong about Milkie.

468
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,690
他不是单独行动
He was not working alone.

469
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,500
不会
No.

470
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,900
根本没有什么模仿犯
You do not have a copycat killer here.

471
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,610
你们的凶手也不止一人
You do not have a lone killer.

472
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,000
这件案子
What you have...

473
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,510
是个阴谋
is a conspiracy.

474
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,710
把富二代挂在本地古迹上的阴谋吗
A conspiracy to hang rich kids off local historical landmarks?

475
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,430
得了吧
Yeah, right.

476
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,560
他总是觉得自己是最聪明的
He always thinks he's the smartest one in the room.

477
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,270
可不是
I know, right?

478
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,200
那是因为我总是跟白痴待在一起
That's because I'm always in a room full of idiots.

479
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,550
小心点他
Watch out for him.

480
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,500
是吗  为什么
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

481
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,240
他是个我行我素的人
He's a loose cannon.

482
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,100
觉得自己是挺身而出的光明骑士
He thinks he's a white knight jumping into the breach

483
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,160
就像电影里的白痴
like some idiot in the movies.

484
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,150
你是在说布洛克吗
You're talking about Bullock here?

485
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,800
就是在说布洛克
We're talking about Bullock here.

486
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,070
哈维・布洛克
Harvey Bullock?

487
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,250
哈维・布洛克  对
Harvey Bullock, yeah.

488
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,340
布洛克警探  你是想现在就把
Detective Bullock, do you want to settle the bill

489
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,420
这个月的帐结了  还是等我寄给你
for this month now or should we send it to you?

490
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:07,370
寄过来吧  谢了
You can just put it in the mail, thanks.

491
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,860
他收到我订的那些杂志了吗
Is he getting those magazines I ordered?

492
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,060
那些杂志都很糟糕  警探
Those are awful magazines, Detective.

493
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,570
他拿到了吧
But he's getting them?

494
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,480
是的
Yes. He is.

495
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,740
很好
Good.

496
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,630
谢谢
Thank you.

497
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,700
不  妈妈  我只带了几样东西
No, Mom. I'm just grabbing a few things.

498
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,690
是的  是的  我知道
Yes. Yes, I know.

499
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,600
我9点到码头
I'll be at the marina at 9:00.

500
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,380
好的
Okay.

501
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,440
-给你  -谢谢  安妮塔
- Here you are. - Thank you, Anita.

502
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,890
帮我装些零食好吗
Oh, will you put some snack stuff together, please?

503
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,590
安珀小姐
Miss Ember?

504
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,200
阿妮塔  你见到我的黄丝上衣...
Anita, have you seen the tops to my yellow silk...?

505
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,120
阿妮塔
Anita?

506
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,270
安珀・科普利本该今晚9点和她父母
Ember Copley was supposed to meet her parents tonight

507
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,980
在码头碰面
9:00 at the marina.

508
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,100
她没出现  他们回来发现
When she didn't show, they came back,

509
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,880
女仆昏过去  安珀不见了
found the maid out cold, Ember gone.

510
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,950
你觉得是山羊杀手
You think it's our guy?

511
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,060
没错
It's our guy.

512
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,170
他溜进来  用氯仿麻醉了女仆
He slips in, chloroforms the maid,

513
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,230
拐走了安珀
grabs Ember,

514
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,490
没有强行闯入的痕迹  就像幽灵一样
no sign of B and E, nothing. Like a ghost.

515
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,860
就像他有钥匙一样
Like he had keys.

516
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,280
兰道尔・米奇会举行仪式
Randall Milkie had a ritual.

517
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,900
他会先打扮被害人  然后杀了他们
He'd dress the victims, kill them

518
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,230
再缝硬币  完成这些大概要八小时
and do his little coin trick-- whole thing took about eight hours.

519
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,350
如果山寨羊是按这路数来的话
If our copy-goat's doing the same thing,

520
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,550
我们就快没时间了
we're running out of time.

521
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,410
我调出了安珀・科普利家大楼的
I pulled the employee list from the agencies

522
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,690
维护公司的职员名单

523
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,170
正在寻找能进入两名被害人公寓的人
Looking for an employee that had access to both victims' apartments.

524
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,670
那可是不少人啊
That's a hell of a lot of people.

525
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,560
是的  但凶手最近非常忙
Yeah, but our guy's been real busy.

526
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,380
他这几天肯定请病假了
He had to have called in sick the last couple days.

527
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,620
找尼格玛来
Get Nygma in there.

528
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,340
他对谜语异常精通
He's freaky good with puzzles.

529
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,590
好的
You got it.

530
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:41,000
芮妮  我们得谈谈
Renee, we have to talk.

531
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,350
-你来干什么  -听着  我知道
- What are you doing here? - Look, I know

532
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,000
你认为他做了很可怕的事
you think that he's done terrible things,

533
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,170
但我也知道你在乎事实
but I also know you care about the truth.

534
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,310
你不该来的  芭芭拉  你不该来
You shouldn't be here. Barbara, you shouldn't be seen here.

535
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,030
该死  芮妮  你听我说行不行
Damn it, Renee! Will you listen to me?!

536
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,700
我会和你合作  好吗
Look. I'll work with you, okay?

537

我会告诉你我知道的一切
I will tell you whatever I know,

538
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,510
我能查明的一切
whatever I can find out.

539
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,490
你不能带有成见  好吗
I need you to keep an open mind, okay?

540
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,760
太晚了
It's too late for that.

541
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,420
不管发生了什么  你都搞错了  芮妮
Whatever's happening, okay, you've got it wrong, Renee.

542
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,090
你不能说  我知道  但不是你想的那样的
You can't tell me, I know that, but it isn't what you think.

543
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,430
他是在保护我
He's trying to protect me.

544
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,380
他不肯告诉我究竟是谁
Okay? He won't tell me who's out there.

545
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,530
-他在害怕谁  -他是对的
- Who he's afraid of. - He's right not to.

546
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,580
等等  为什么
Wait. Why?

547
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,850
因为你会因此送命  好吗
Because it'll get you killed, okay?

548
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,080
你得明白  他知道的事
You understand what he knows,

549
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,450
他认识的人会要了你的命
who he knows will kill you.

550
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,980
我们找了个法官今晚就签发逮捕令
We got a judge issuing a warrant tonight.

551
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,770
芭芭拉  你知道我有多关心你

552
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,730
等戈登被逮捕的时候  你千万要离开那里

554
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,050
就是他身边
By his side.

555
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,600
求你了  走吧
Please, just leave.

556
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,290
离开哥谭  直到这一切平息

557
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,430
而且别再来找我了
And don't come to me again.

558
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,050
共有四个人从上周起就请了病假

住在外区的两个嫌疑人已经排除了

561
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,750
所以
So...

562
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,060

他的值班长说他最近在一栋建筑里蹭房

near Cannery Park, somewhere around the 1100 block.

566
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,450
-就是他  -你确定

567
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,200
我确定  我百分百确定
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm 100% sure.

568
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,140
一整天都这么似曾相识
Déjà voodoo all day long.

569
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:35,060
这就是10年前我们拿下兰道尔・米奇的地方

现在我们将让你永远睡去

00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,700
你没做什么非法的事吧
You're not doing anything illegal?

596
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,370
没有  妈  别担心
No, Mom. Don't worry.

597
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,010
生意而已
It's just business.

598
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,430
做生意没关系
Well, business is all very fine,

599

但一定要记住

600
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,230
你谁都不能信
you can trust no one.

601
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,000
只能信妈妈

警察
Police?

警察都是骗子
The police are liars.

609
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,310
这个人不是  妈
Hmm-mm, not this one, Mom.

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,150
他是个真正的朋友
He's a real friend.

611
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,290
有他帮忙  我会好起来的

还真被你们逮着了
You got him.

干得漂亮  两位
Good work, detectives.

622
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,480
我有很多电话要去打
I got a lot of phone calls to make.

623
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,610
布洛克  开心点
Bullock, look happier.

624
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:43,720
怎么了
What?

625
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,010
兰道尔・米奇所工作的维修公司
Randall Milkie worked for a maintenance company

626
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,280
负责被他杀害的人所住的大楼
that serviced the buildings of his victims,

627
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,710
雷蒙德的情况一样
same as Raymond here.

628
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,690
米奇有精神病
Milkie was mentally ill,

629
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,290
无暴力犯罪史
no violent crimes in his history,

630
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:55,440
他也一样
same as him.

631
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,630
相隔十年  根本不认识
Ten years apart, they never meet,

632
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,610
结果有一天  突然之间
then one day, suddenly, out of the blue,

633
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,740
他们就都决定变成山羊杀手
they both decide to become the Goat?

634
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,510
感觉好像
It's like...

635
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,760
有什么东西找上了他们
it's like something found them.

636
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,400
改变了他们
Changed them.

637
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,310
你是指狄克斯的阴谋论吗
You talking about Dix and his conspiracy theory?

638
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,180
不是
No.

639
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,620
只是觉得不对劲
It just doesn't add up.

640
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,780
而且他怎么知道硬币的事的
And how'd he know about the coin?

641
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,070
我们肯定漏掉了什么
I know that we're missing something,

642
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,840
如果我们不查清楚
and if we keep missing it,

643
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,110
恐怕这事永远没完
I'm afraid we're never gonna stop this.

644
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,050
好吧
Okay.

645
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,450
我们再回去看看米奇的案卷
We go back to Milkie's files.

646
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:28,550
看看有没有可能的共犯
We, uh... look for possible accomplices,

647
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,180
-任何联系  -明天的吧
- uh, connections... - Tomorrow, tomorrow.

648
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,410
我得想想
I, uh, just... I need... I need to think.

649
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,340
你去...
Why don't you, uh,

650
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,910
休息一下吧
get some rest?

651
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,930
嗯
Yeah.

652
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,520
再见
Night.

653
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,570
再见  吉姆
Good night, Jim.

654
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,010
不  不
No. No.

655
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,270
不  不
No. No.

656
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,390
不
Oh, no.

657
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,450
不  不
No. No.

658
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,170
不  不
No. No.

659
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,290
我了个神啊
Holy Ghost on a bicycle.

660
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:29,960
芭芭拉
Barbara?

661
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,490
吉姆  听我说
Jim, look.

662
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,150
我并不知道全部  但我知道的够多了
I don't know everything, but I know enough.

663
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,510
你得听我的
You have to listen to me now.

664
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,380
亲爱的  我都站不稳了
Baby, I can barely stand.

665
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,110
蒙托亚有目击证人
Montoya has a witness.

666
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,640
什么
What?

667
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,130
他们坚信你杀了这个科波特
They really believe you killed this Cobblepot person.

668
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,230
-我没有  -现在不重要了
- I didn't. - It doesn't matter anymore.

669
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,020
他们签了一份你的逮捕令
They've got a warrant for your arrest.

670
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,770
你还瞒了我什么
What aren't you telling me?

671
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:54,130
这几周  你就像变了个人
For weeks now, it's like you've been a different person.

672
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,180
你入职之后不久发生了件什么事
Something happened not long after you started the job.

673
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,200
这件事
Something...

674
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,710
让你无法认同
something you don't feel right about.

675
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,320
他们把我逼进了死角
Somehow, they've cornered me.

676
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,300
让我没有选择
Tied my hands.

677
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,920
跟我走吧
Come with me now. Okay?

678
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,000
我不管我要抛下什么
I don't care what I leave behind,

679
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,680
只要我们能一起走就行
as long as we leave it together.

680
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,340
如果他们带走你  吉姆
If they take you away, Jim,

681
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,880
我怕我会失去你
I'm scared I'll lose you.

682
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,430
-芭芭拉  -求你
- Barbara... - Please!

683
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,850
我不能逃避
I can't run.

684
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,760
不能逃避
Can't run.

685
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,200
詹姆斯・戈登  你因涉嫌杀害
James Gordon... you're under arrest

686
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,800
奥斯瓦尔德・切斯特菲尔德・科波特被捕
for the murder of Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot.

687
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,200
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

688
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,500
你所说的一切都将作为呈堂证供
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

689
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,260
你在向深处沉沦
You're drifting down and away... deeper...

690
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,630
没事的
I got it.

691
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,230
抱歉打扰你们
I'm sorry to interrupt.

692
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,310
-是布洛克警探吧  -对
- It's Detective Bullock, isn't it? - Yeah.

693
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,380
你是想跟黑斯廷斯先生谈谈吗
Did you want to interview Mr. Hastings?

694
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,660
其实是你的秘书叫我来这儿找你
Actually, your secretary told me I might be able to find you here.

695
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,230
我是想听听你对案子的看法
I was hoping to pick your brain about the case.

696
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,120
我就回来
Oh. Uh, I'll just be a minute.

697
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,000
没事的
It's okay.

698
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,590
我之前没发现
I didn't realize this before.

699
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,480
你是个催眠师  是吧
You're a hypnotist, right?

700
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,960
催眠治疗师
A hypnotherapist.

701
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,150
治疗师
Oh, therapist.

702
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,390
这个词挺有意思
It's a funny word, therapist.

703
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,530
治疗师如果拆开可以念作"强奸犯"
Can either mean "therapist" Or "the rapist," if...

704
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,570
你在一家门诊诊所做免费治疗  是吗
So you do pro bono work at an outpatient clinic?

705
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,730
还是好几家
Or a couple of them?

706
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,290
是的  我想回馈社会
I do. I try to give back.

707
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,840
是啊  你这么做已经挺久的了
Yeah, you've been giving back for a while, uh...

708
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,760
有12年了
12 years now.

709
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,210
真不错
That's good.

710
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,380
老实说
To be honest, I...

711
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,780
我想跟你谈谈你的一位免费病人
wanted to talk to you about one of your pro bono patients.

712
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,550
雷蒙德・厄尔
Uh, Raymond Earl?

713
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,220
他是我们调查中的
He's a person of interest

714
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,820
一位嫌疑人
in our investigation.

715
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:03,980
记录显示你给他
Our records indicate you've seen him, uh...

716
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,090
治疗过好几次
at least a few times, right?

717
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,870
好像是的
Sounds familiar.

718
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,460
大概是去年吧
Last year, maybe?

719
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,610
黑斯廷斯先生  阿曼达的父亲
And Mr. Hastings, Amanda's father...

720
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,450
他是你的病人
we know he's your patient.

721
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,560
我们昨天来的时候
When we were here yesterday,

722
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,020
他有个奇怪的举动
he was doing something really curious.

723
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,870
就是
It, uh...

724
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,010
他一直不停地握拳
he, uh... he kept clenching his fist.

725
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,410
反反复复
Over and over.

726
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,400
-是啊  他有这习惯  -嗯
- Yes, he does that. - Yeah.

727
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,420
我去查了下资料
See, I was reading about that,

728
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,440
说是如果病人有一种强迫症
and it said that if a patient has a compulsion,

729
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,710
比如有什么坏念头或一种冲动
like a bad idea or an impulse,

730
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,480
催眠师可以把病人催眠
that the hypnotist could put the poor sap under

731
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,300
然后引入一种肢体动作
and introduce a... a physical movement.

732
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,830
比如握拳
Like, uh, clenching your fist.

733
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,320
这样病人受强迫症影响而想做的事就会停止
So instead of doing what the compulsion wants the person to do,

734
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,500
改成只做
they just...

735
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,900
握拳
clench their fist.

736
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,180
就是这个道理  没错
That's how it works, pretty much.

737
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,230
所以黑斯廷斯先生
So Mr. Hastings, when he's in a, uh,

738
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,510
当他面对一屋子人时
room full of people and he wants to start

739
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,700
或许他会想大叫什么的
screaming his head off, I don't know,

740
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,470
但他不会再那么做了  他只会...
instead of doing that, he just...

741
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,490
好的
Okay.

742
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,360
那么雷蒙德・厄尔呢
What about Raymond Earl?

743
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,820
他为什么握拳呢
Why does he clench his fist?

744
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,190
还有兰道尔・米奇呢
And what about Randall Milkie?

745
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,560
我知道你十年多前治疗过他
See, I know you treated him a little over ten years ago,

746
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,900
你可要听好了  接下来的部分有点诡异
and I want you to follow me because this part gets a little weird.

747
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,790
我觉得是有位催眠师把这两个人
See, I think a hypnotist completely turned both those men

748
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,150
彻底颠覆了
upside down.

749
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,310
直到他们抛弃了自己的身份
Until their own identity was the bad idea,

750
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,560
这时候握拳的就不是他们自己了
and then it wasn't even them clenching their fists anymore.

751
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,190
而是山羊之灵
It was the Spirit of the Goat.

752
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,020
我低估了你
I underestimated you.

753
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,460
真的
I really did.

754
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,130
我说对了
So I'm right.

755
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,070
我说对了
Yes, I'm right.

756
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:41,170
你去那些门诊诊所到处转
And so you trolled all the outpatient clinics

757
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:44,530
就为找到兰道尔・米奇这种合适的社会边缘人
so you could find a suitable borderline case like Randall Milkie.

758
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,300
把他催眠  直至那可怜虫
And then you hypnotize the poor bastard

759
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,510
完全忘记了自己的身份
until he literally doesn't even know who he is.

760
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,430
然后我给他灌输新的身份
And then I tell him who he is.

761
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,370
真聪明  警探
That's pretty good intellection, Detective.

762
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,520
为什么
Why?

763
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,720
为什么要催眠一个门卫
Why hypnotize a janitor

764
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,240
把他变成山羊杀手
and turn him into the Goat?

765
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,630
你不会理解的

说来听听
Try me.

767
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,410
这不是凶杀或疯狂

768
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,820
这是治疗
It's an act of therapy.

769
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,400
治疗谁
Therapy? For who?

770

哥谭
For Gotham.

771
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:09,850
什么
Excuse me?

772
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,490
这个城市曾经是有希望的
This city used to have hope,

773
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,860
却被他们赶尽杀绝
and they gunned it down in the streets.

774
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,770
那些有钱有势的人
The rich, the powerful.

775
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,820
他们的贪婪是一种病态

00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,710
一种疯狂的"本我"  吞噬着哥谭

777
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,400
所以你的解决方案就是杀光市里的富二代

00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
负强化

相信山羊杀手真实存在

这是哥谭需要的
Gotham wanted that.

782
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,230
不管这多么痛苦
No matter how painful it was.

783
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,030
有句话说得对
It's true what they say.

784
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,880
你能催眠一个人去做的事
You can't really hypnotize somebody to do something that,

785
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,650
都是他们内心深处其实早就想做的事
deep down, they don't already want to do.

786
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,820
内心深处
And deep down,

787
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,490
我们都仇富
we all want to eat the rich.

788
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,930
是不是
Don't we?

789
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,590
你是个百分百的疯婆子
You are 100% nuthouse crazy, lady.

790
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,990
马科斯医生  没事吧
Dr. Marks... is everything okay?

791
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,270
有事
No, it's not.

马科斯医生  你被捕了
Dr. Marks, you're under arrest

793
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,500
罪名是阴谋谋杀  强迫

794
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,360
老实说  估计有几项罪名
and, frankly, a few things

795
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,120
我们得以你来命名了

醒醒  黑斯廷斯先生

801
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,850
别动  女人
Freeze, lady!

802
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,190
再说一遍
One more time.

803
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,220
再跟我说一遍
Take me through the part

804
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,850

马科斯医生就是山羊之灵

而且我已经有进展了

你要进的是6乘8的黑门监狱囚室
Getting into a six-by-eight in the Blackgate Pen,

813
