《哥谭》前情提要
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:03,890
我都说过了嘛
Told you.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,850
小菜一碟
Easy as pie.

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,250
-什么  -对不住了  弗兰基
- What? - Sorry, Frankie.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,570
阿诺德・弗拉斯
Arnold Flass.

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,570
你因杀害利昂・温克勒被捕了
You're under arrest for the murder of Leon Winkler.

7
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,450
你真以为这些人会允许你逮捕我吗
You really think these guys are gonna let you arrest me?

8
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,790
闭嘴吧  弗拉斯
Shut up, Flass.

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,470
企鹅  过来
Penguin, come here.

10
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,510
你是只聪明的小猴子
You're a smart monkey...

11
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,870
但我是动物园的看守
but and I'm the zookeeper.

12
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,160
我没想到会是你  亲爱的
I didn't think it was going to be you, my dear.

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,380
你可以出来了
You can come out now.

14
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,130
你又说对了  我的朋友
Right, as usual, my friend.

15
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,310
你得走了
You got to go!

16
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,550
我起誓  布奇
I swear, Butch,

17
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,110
我会回来杀了企鹅
I'm gonna come back and kill Penguin

哥谭
第一季  第十四集

26
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,840
你确定吗
You're sure, now?

27
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,000
菲什・穆尼已经完蛋了
Fish Mooney is done.

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,350
她试图扳倒法尔科内
She tried to bring down Falcone.

29
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,740
结果没成
She failed.

30
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,340
上次我见到她时  维克多・萨斯把她逼到绝境了
Last time I saw her, Victor Zsasz had her cornered.

31
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,170
我们可以认定  她现在非死即伤
We can assume she's either dead or extremely unwell.

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,730
那好  干杯
Well, then. Salud.

33
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,180
这创造了些有趣的机遇
You know, this creates some intriguing opportunities.

34
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,570
法尔科内会想方设法
Falcone will struggle

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,030
留住她的地盘
to hold on to her territories.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,950
要是我们动作够快
If we move quickly...

37
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,930
所见略同
My thinking exactly.

38
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,890
事实上
In fact,

39
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,520
我已自作主张收了她的夜店
I took the liberty of claiming her nightclub.

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,280
当然是在您名下
In your name, of course.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,700
是吗
You did, huh?

42
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,470
脑子转挺快
Good thinking.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,430
一鸟在手即为所有
A bird in the hand is nine-tenths of the law, right?

44
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,180
没错  没错
Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,150
老大  找您的
Phone for you, boss.

46
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,730
说
Speak.

47
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,070
你好  萨尔
Hello, Sal.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,700
你听起来很吃惊
You sound surprised.

49
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,890
让我猜猜  你的小伙伴企鹅跟你说我死了
Let me guess-- your little friend Penguin told you I was dead.

50
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,110
与死无异
As good as.

51
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,050
我只是休个假而已
I'm just on a vacation for a while.

52
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,430
我也不准备骗你
I'm not going to lie,

53
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,810
我以为我能胜利  结果  却被耍了
I thought I was gonna end up on top. Instead, I got played.

54
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,930
原来  企鹅自始至终
Turns out, Penguin has been

55
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,550
都是法尔科内的人
Falcone's man the whole time.

56
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,860
他把我们俩都当猴耍了
They played us both for suckers.

57
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,990
是吗
Is that right?

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,600
千真万确
Ah, indeed.

59
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,920
在我准备宰了他前  他亲口告诉我的
He told me himself, right before I was about to gut him.

60
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,050
你明白我为什么会有所疑虑
You understand why I might be skeptical,

61
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,920
毕竟告诉我这个消息的人是你
considering it's you telling me this.

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,560
醒醒吧  傻瓜
Oh, wake up, dummy.

63
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,220
你难道想说
You mean to tell me

64
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,060
你从来就没怀疑过什么
this whole time you haven't suspected anything?

65
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,310
他就没有一次说漏嘴然后解释敷衍过去了吗
That he hasn't made one slip that he's had to explain away?

66
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,900
或许你其实想相信他的谎言
Or maybe even you wanted to believe his lies.

67
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,270
但还是让人不放心  不是吗
But it still gnaws at you, doesn't it?

68
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,580
那份疑虑
The doubt.

69
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,630
这儿  有个污点
It's right there. A smudge.

70
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,220
下次不许再犯了
Don't let it happen again.

71
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,360
或许有一两次
Maybe a couple of times.

72
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,280
该清理你的手下了  萨尔维多
It's time to get your house in order, Salvatore.

73
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,740
要记得是谁点醒你的
And remember who put you wise.

74
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,250
但愿不是坏消息
Not bad news, I hope.

75
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,850
不  我得北上一趟
Nah. I got to go upstate.

76
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,300
找一个人有点事
See a guy about a thing.

77
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,150
跟我一起来
Come with me.

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,390
我们可以好好讨论一下机遇
We can talk about opportunities.

79
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,200
好啊
Sure.

80
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,700
让我先回家一趟
Just, uh, let me run home and...

81
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,870
我们得马上走  就现在
We got to go now. Right now.

82
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,680
好极了
Super.

83
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,370
我最喜欢旅游了
I love a road trip.

84
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,670
哈维
Harvey?

85
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,330
警监
Captain.

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,410
什么情况
What have we got?

87
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,050
昨晚某个时刻  那边那位幸运先生
Sometime last night, Mr. Lucky there

88
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,360
被绑在了椅子上  脖子上套了绳索
got tied to that chair, noose was dropped over his neck

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,710
然后被从大楼一侧抛了下去
and he's heaved over the side.

90
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,910
今早有几个上班族上来抽烟时发现了尸体
Some suits coming up for a smoke this morning found him.

91
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,490
他怎么回到楼顶的
How'd he get back up to the roof?

92
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,900
瞧那边的滑轮
See that pulley there?

93
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,590
我估计  是凶手捞回来的
My guess, it was the killer.

94
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,700
这家伙费尽心思让死者回到楼顶
Guy went to a lot of trouble to get him back up.

95
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,240
为什么不干脆让他一直吊着呢
Why not just leave him hanging?

96
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,440
早上好  警监
Morning, Captain.

97
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,120
早上好  爱德
Morning, Ed.

98
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,870
你越切割我  我长得越大  我是什么
The more you cut me the bigger I grow. What am I?

99
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,260
我们在楼顶  尼格玛
We're on a rooftop, Nygma.

100
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,330
别逼我
Don't tempt me.

101
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,240
洞孔  我是个洞孔
A hole. I'm a hole.

102
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,060
好吧
Okay.

103
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,950
有什么关联啊
Relevance?

104
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,260
被害人的腹部有个洞孔  是手术切口
There's a hole, a surgical incision in our victim's abdomen.

105
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,690
是死后切开的
Certainly postmortem.

106
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,870
凶手应该是在找东西
Killer was looking for something.

107
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,570
等回到实验室  我再做彻底的尸检
I'll have to examine the body more fully back at the lab.

108
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,460
你是指验尸官会做
You mean the medical examiner will.

109
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,060
不过...
Well, but...

110
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,750
你是鉴证科的  爱德
You handle forensics, Ed.

111
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,640
验尸由戈拉医生负责
The bodies belong to Dr. Guerra.

112
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,320
他已正式投诉数次
And he's made formal complaints.

113
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,100
我无法再为你掩护了
I can't cover for you anymore.

114
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,340
我明白了  长官
I read you, ma'am.

115
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
非常清楚
Loud and clear.

116
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,950
戈登去哪了
So where's Gordon?

117
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,130
处理私事  他马上就过来
Personal stuff. He'll be in soon.

118
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,740
别离楼边太近
Hey, don't stand so near the edge.

119
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,290
你担心我吗  警监
You worried about me, Captain?

120
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,630
你知道我中午以后才会开始喝酒
You know I don't start drinking till noon.

121
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,070
你要我跟你挑明吗
I got to spell it out for you?

122
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,000
弗拉斯警探有很多朋友
Detective Flass had a lot of friends,

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,190
而你的搭档以凶杀罪逮捕了他
and your partner arrested him for murder.

124
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,900
意外无处不在
Accidents happen.

125
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,200
是你拿手铐铐他的
You put the cuffs on him.

126
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
所以我们都要小心
So we should all be careful.

127
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,160
见鬼去吧
To hell with them.

128
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,040
芭芭拉
Barbara?

129
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,500
放开我
Let go of me.

130
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,050
你住多久了
How long you been here?

131
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,320
就昨晚
Just last night.

132
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,960
还有之前几次
And a couple times before.

133
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,490
我知道你女友不在
I knew your girlfriend was gone,

134
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,590
还听说你被派去守疯人院
and I heard you got sent to guard that loony bin,

135
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,550
于是我想  在这儿留宿比睡街上好
so I figured better here than sleeping on the street.

136
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,200
-你看见芭芭拉了吗  -没有
- Have you seen Barbara? - No.

137
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,720
你们俩算彻底完了吗
Oh, so things are over between you two, huh?

138
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,970
你确定你能进来吗
Sure you should be here then?

139
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,810
也许你才是闯入者
Maybe you're the one breaking in.

140
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,090
我是过来放钥匙的  去收拾你的东西
Came by to drop off keys. Go get your stuff.

141
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,120
为什么  你要带我去哪里
Why? Where are you taking me?

142
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
你不能住在这里
Well, you're not staying here,

143
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,340
也不能住在街上
and you're not gonna stay on the street.

144
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,800
我给你找个安全的地方
I'll find you someplace safe.

145
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,830
安全
Safe.

146
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,030
像韦恩庄园那样安全吗
Safe like Wayne Manor?

147
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,880
上次你出的好主意
That was your last great idea.

148
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,160
那我就给你找别的地方
So someplace else.

149
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,010
你还是韦恩案唯一的证人
You're still my only witness to the Wayne murders.

150
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,240
布鲁斯回来之后你没跟他说过话吗
You haven't talked to Bruce since he got back?

151
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,580
-没有  怎么了  -因为我告诉过他了
- No. Why? - Because I told him already.

152
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:33,930
我什么也没看见
I didn't see anything.

153
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,790
我说谎了
I lied.

154
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,390
你女友的事真可惜
Sucks about your girlfriend.

155
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,100
她的东西真有档次
She's got some really nice stuff.

156
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,050
等下
Hey, wait!

157
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,400
站住
Stop!

158
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,970
詹姆斯・戈登警探来见你了  布鲁斯少爷
Detective James Gordon to see you, Master Bruce.

159
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,260
警探
Detective.

160
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,060
布鲁斯  你好吗
Bruce, how are you?

161
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,290
我很好  谢谢
I'm fine, thank you.

162
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,280
我之前就该过来的
I would've come by earlier,

163
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,370
但是最近事情有点乱
but things were a little crazy.

164
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,010
你离开了一阵子
You were gone for a while.

165
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,570
瑞士
Switzerland.

166
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,820
好决定
Probably wise.

167
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,940
我见到了塞琳娜・凯尔
I saw Selina Kyle.

168
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,610
她跟我说她撒谎了
She told me she lied.

169
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,760
她什么都没看到
She saw nothing.

170
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,750
是的
Yes.

171
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,260
她也是这么和我说的
That's what she told me.

172
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,240
她为了不去少管所而编了个故事
She made up the story to get out of juvie.

173
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,480
她现在这么说可能是因为害怕了
She could be saying this now because she's scared.

174
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,050
鉴于之前发生的事  这也可以理解
It would be understandable after what happened.

175
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,310
不
No.

176
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,710
她没有那么胆小
She doesn't scare easily.

177
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,810
我相信她
I believe her.

178
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,470
她没有看到凶手
She didn't see the killer.

179
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,060
这确实很令人遗憾
Look, this is unfortunate,

180
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,280
但是这不意味着我们就回到了起点
but it doesn't mean we're back to square one.

181
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,070
有人派了刺客杀她
Someone sent assassins after her.

182
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,810
只有心怀鬼胎的人才会这么做
Only a guilty person would do that.

183
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,270
是呀  把该死的刺客引来了庄园
Yes, and led her bloody assassins to the manor.

184
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,310
真是太感谢你了
Thank you very much.

185
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
总之  你不需要再关注这件案子了
Anyway, you need no longer concern yourself with the case.

186
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,130
布鲁斯  这不是放弃的时候
Bruce, this isn't the time to give up.

187
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,290
我没要放弃
I'm not giving up.

188
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,530
我不明白
I don't understand.

189
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,240
几个月前  你保证你会找到杀害我父母的凶手
Months ago, you promised you'd find who killed my parents,

190
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,340
而这段时间里  你只找到了一名证人
and in all that time, you've managed to find one witness,

191
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,590
还是个假冒的
who turned out to be a liar.

192
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,660
这种调查需要时间
An investigation like this takes time.

193
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,510
我理解  但是我不想让你觉得
I understand, but I don't want you to feel bound

194
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,930
被一个无法实现的诺言所束缚
by an oath you can't fulfill.

195
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,710
你不需要再遵守对我的承诺了
I'm releasing you from your promise.

196
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,990
我会自己追查这件事
I'll pursue the matter on my own.

197
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,450
布鲁斯
Bruce.

198
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,930
劝你别费劲了  真的  老兄
Yeah, no, I really wouldn't bother, actually, mate.

199
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,080
一旦布鲁斯少爷决定了
Once Master Bruce makes up his mind,

200
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,380
就无法再说服他了
there's no arguing with him.

201
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,350
他不能自己追查这件事
He can't pursue this case on his own.

202
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,270
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

203
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,830
那我就得照顾他了
Then I'll have to look after him.

204
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,410
我送你去门口吧
Can I show you the door?

205
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,640
瞌睡虫
Hey, sleepy head.

206
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,580
我们到了
We're here.

207
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,350
你闻到这味道了吗
You smell that air?

208
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,740
乡下的味道
That's country air.

209
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,600
咱们去弄点吃的吧
Let's get some chow.

210
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,370
吃的
Chow.

211
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,550
太好了
Excellent.

212
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,740
您那个人呢
So where's the guy?

213
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,820
什么人
Which guy?

214
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,910
有事的那个人
The guy with the thing.

215
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,650
他会来的
Oh, he'll be along.

216
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,730
你不喜欢咖啡吗
You don't like the coffee?

217
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,110
我喜欢咖啡
I like the coffee.

218
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,210
那燕麦粥呢
How about the oatmeal?

219
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,000
也很喜欢
Also delicious.

220
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,700
出城感觉挺不错的吧
It's good to get out of the city, huh?

221
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,630
远离尘嚣  噪音
Away from the fumes, the noise.

222
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,520
终于能静下心思考了
I can finally hear myself think.

223
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,230
这里是那么
It's all so...

224
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,500
简单  干净  诚实
simple and clean and honest out here.

225
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,560
新鲜空气  燕麦粥
Fresh air, oatmeal,

226
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,850
好朋友
good friends.

227
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:54,950
说得太对了
How true.

228
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,010
在哥谭  咱俩总没时间交流  反思
In Gotham, we never have any time to connect, to reflect.

229
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,150
-你明白吗  -当然
- You feel that? - Absolutely.

230
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,230
这个有事的人
This guy with the thing...

231
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,810
是什么事啊
What is the thing?

232
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,250
别去想那人了
Stop worrying about that guy.

233
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,070
知道我在想什么吗
You know what I was thinking about?

234
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,220
真是疯狂
This is crazy.

235
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,920
印第安山
Indian Hill.

236
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,210
阿卡姆那块我用来跟法尔科内换你脑袋的
You know, that dump in Arkham that I traded to Falcone

237
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,510
破地皮
for your neck.

238
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,640
怎么忘得了呢
How could I forget?

239
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,310
我不胜感激
I'm eternally grateful.

240
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,030
是你在我耳边提议的
You suggested it, whispered it in my ear.

241
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,830
那是块一文不值的破地
It's worthless land.

242
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,810
真的是一文不值吗
But was it so worthless?

243
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,010
法尔科内当时立刻就同意了
I mean, Falcone snapped it up pretty quick.

244
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,190
就是个象征
It was a token.

245
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,280
他只是要挽回面子而已
He simply needed to save face.

246
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,490
在尼古拉死后
After Nikolai died...

247
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,580
我说了你肯定不会信
Ah, see, you wouldn't believe it.

248
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,230
我正好也在想这件事
That's the other thing I was thinking about.

249
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,410
跟尼古拉的那场火拼  弗兰基被杀那次
The fight with Nikolai when Frankie was killed.

250
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,300
他被捅了有十刀吧
What was he stabbed, like, ten times?

251
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,310
我不记得具体数目了
I don't recall the exact number.

252
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,130
但那是场枪战啊
Only, it was a gunfight.

253
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,630
弗兰基怎么会死在一把刀下
How'd Frankie get killed with a knife?

254
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,790
这事一直让我百思不得其解
That always kind of bugged me.

255
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,490
老实说
Honestly,

256
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,790
每当牵涉到武力  我就没多大用了
I'm not much use when things get physical.

257
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,270
很抱歉我没能救他
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.

258
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,870
我只是在回想
I was just reminiscing.

259
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,960
别责怪自己
Don't beat yourself up about it.

260
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,470
我们都有各自的长处
We all got our talents, right?

261
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,400
是的
Yes, we do.

262
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,790
我
Me...

263
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,240
别看块头大  反应其实很敏捷
I'm deceptively quick for a big guy.

264
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,000
没错
Yes, you are.

265
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,660
我要出去呼吸点新鲜空气
I'm gonna go get some air.

266
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,900
等那个有事的人来
Wait for the guy with the thing, hmm?

267
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,940
那人  没错
The guy. Right.

268
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,810
不如第一次就别出错
How about getting it right the first time

269
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,960
这样我们就不用总这样了
so we don't have to keep doing this?

270
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,490
布洛克警探
Detective Bullock?

271
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,080
正是  有话快说
It's my name. Don't wear it out.

272
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,250
我叫斯科蒂・穆伦斯
I'm Scottie Mullens.

273
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,090
你找我谈亚当・戈多夫斯基的事
You called me about Adam Jodowsky.

274
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,780
对  穆伦斯小姐  没错
Oh... Oh, Miss Mullens, yes.

275
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,480
谢谢你来一趟
Thank you for stopping by.

276
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,110
小姐还是夫人
Uh, Miss? Mrs.?

277
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,920
小姐
Miss.

278
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,890
好的  好的  这边请
Good. Good. Please.

279
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,670
那
So...

280
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,350
你是怎么认识戈多夫斯基先生的
how did you know Mr. Jodowsky?

281
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,590
我是他的担保人
I was his sponsor, sort of.

282
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,540
我们一起参加互助组
We're... we're in a support group together.

283
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,150
他死了  是吗
He's dead, isn't he?

284
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,320
你为什么这么说
Why would you say that?

285
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,860
这里是凶案组
This is a homicide division.

286
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,630
而你是凶案组警探
You're a homicide detective.

287
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,380
今早我们发现了他的尸体
We found his body this morning.

288
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,430
他的口袋里有你的号码
Your number was in his pocket.

289
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,480
我刚刚给他的
I'd just given it to him.

290
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,140
我最近才开始做他的担保人
I recently started being his sponsor.

291
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,630
这个互助组是什么样的小组
So, uh, what kind of group is this?

292
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,260
是戒酒还是戒毒的
Uh, for booze, pills?

293
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,210
是为患有恐惧症的人而开设的
It's for people suffering from phobias.

294
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,610
-开玩笑吧  -恐惧会让人无力
- You're joking. - Fear can be debilitating.

295
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,710
和人聊聊病情有所帮助
It helps to talk to someone about it.

296
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,190
别犯浑
Don't be an ass.

297
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,300
-你说什么  -你要拿这事开玩笑
- Excuse me? - You were about to make fun.

298
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
别犯浑
Don't be an ass.

299
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,200
你说得对  抱歉  我不该这样
You're right. I'm sorry. I was.

300
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
不拿这事开玩笑  请坐
No fun-making. Please.

301
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,410
戈多夫斯基先生生前恐惧什么
What was Mr. Jodowsky's phobia?

302
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,280
恐高
Heights.

303
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,400
那如果他被人挂在一座高层建筑上...
So if he was found dangling from the top of a tall building...

304
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,530
天啊  他就是那么...
Oh, my God. Is that how he...?

305
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,830
我需要所有互助组成员的名字
I'm gonna need the names of all the people in the support group.

306
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,280
互助组完全是匿名的
It's completely anonymous.

307
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,730
亚当是唯一一个和我有私交的人
Adam was the only one I knew personally.

308
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,300
不会是互助组里的人干的吧
You don't think someone from the group did this?

309
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,540
有可能  凶手显然知道他的恐惧症
Could be. Killer certainly seemed to know of his phobia.

310
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,920
你是爱尔兰人吗
Are you Irish?

311
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,670
你看着好像是爱尔兰人
Y-You seem like you could be Irish.

312
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,780
这有什么关系
What's it to you?

313
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,090
我只是好奇
I'm just curious.

314
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,050
下一次开会是什么时候
When's the next meeting?

315
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,790
今晚6点
Tonight, 6:00.

316
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,170
一般开多久  一小时吗
And these things-- they usually run, what, an hour?

317
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,300
那么
So,

318
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,910
结束之后  你还可以去吃晚餐
you could maybe go to dinner afterwards.

319
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,860
有这种可能吧
Hypothetically.

320
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,160
有这种可能
Hypothetically.

321
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,250
很好  我会继续调查这件案子
Okay, well, I'm gonna keep working the case,

322
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:53,500
如果有必要去互助组走一趟  我会给你打电话的
and I'm gonna call you if I feel the need to go to this meeting.

323
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,700
我们会找到凶手的
We're gonna find who did this.

324
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,110
我保证  穆伦斯小姐
I promise, Miss Mullens.

325
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,600
好的
Okay.

326
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,690
我查了犯罪现场的东西
So I went through the materials from the scene.

327
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,920
绳子和滑轮哪里都买得到
Ropes and pulleys can be bought anywhere.

328
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,980
不管怎么样  我又查了
For what it's worth, I, uh, traced the chair

329
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,670
绑着被害人的椅子
the victim was tied to.

330
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,390
我在听呢
Yeah. I'm listening.

331
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,870
这种木质的滑轮椅是奈何岛
Banker's chair, wooden, made by some company in the Narrows

332
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,370
一家倒闭多年的工厂生产的
that's been closed down for years.

333
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,430
太好了  我们走
Great. Let's go.

334
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,900
真的吗  这条线索希望不大啊  哈维
You sure? That's a pretty thin lead, Harv.

335
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,400
你不是从来不怕麻烦的吗
Since when have you been scared of a little work, huh?

336
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,860
他想要什么呢
What was he after?

337
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,310
啊呀呀
Well, now.

338
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,700
看见了吧  我说了
There! See? I told you!

339
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,590
上帝啊
Oh, dear.

340
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,350
把你的手从尸体里拿出来
Get your hand out of that corpse.

341
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,950
马上
Now.

342
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,480
我刚刚路过
I was just passing by, and I, um,

343
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,700
有点好奇
uh... I was... I was just curious.

344
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,360
我怎么搞的
What was I thinking?

345
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,800
非常抱歉
I... Sorry.

346
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,390
绝不会再这样了  我保证
Won't happen again. Promise.

347
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,870
你要是再不采取行动  我就上报了
Do something about this or I'm going over your head.

348
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,460
我才是法医
I'm the medical examiner!

349
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,440
不是这个胡言乱语的疯子
Not this gibbering loon!

350
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,390
对不起  爱德
I'm sorry, Ed.

351
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,050
你被暂时停职了
Till further notice, you're suspended.

352
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,070
总算啊
Finally.

353
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,470
可我有发现啊
But I found something.

354
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,370
大家都在说
So, word around the house is that

355
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,590
你和美女医生好上了
you and Doc Caliente have a thing.

356
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,020
汤普金斯吗
Thompkins?

357
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,380
算是吧
Yeah, kind of. I guess.

358
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,660
那你和芭芭拉就彻底掰了
So you and Barbara are finally finito?

359
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,520
对
Yeah.

360
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,550
今天去公寓把钥匙留下了
Dropped the keys off at her apartment today.

361
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,230
有没有打分手炮
Get any of that righteous breakup sex?

362
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,620
她不在
She wasn't there.

363
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,970
你发现我从不问你的感情生活吧
You notice I don't ask you about your love life?

364
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,220
我的感情生活短暂凌乱  毫无可瞒
My love life is an open book and a short and nasty one.

365
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,680
不过我看上被害人互助会的那个朋友了
But I'm working on the vic's friend in the phobia support group,

366
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,460
只要她不是凶手
and unless she's the killer,

367
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,570
我一定要追她
I think I'm in there.

368
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,230
这就是我为什么不问
You see why I don't ask?

369
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,470
别伤人家医生的心
Don't screw it up with the doctor.

370
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,610
尽量吧
I'll try not to.

371
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,910
说真的  我最近对你宽宏大量
Seriously, been willing to forgive you on account

372
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,070
都是可怜你欲求不满  可你现在告诉我
of you're not getting laid, but you mean to tell me

373
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,320
这段时间你到处大放厥词
this whole time you've been making speeches,

374
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,540
搞得天翻地覆  居然不是因为寂寞
raising hell, you've had a woman?

375
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,890
一想到你要是寂寞了  能做出什么事来
The thought of what you would do if alone

376
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,520
我就害怕得要死
is truly terrifying.

377
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,810
哥谭市警局
GCPD!

378
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,320
把刀子放下
Drop the knife!

379
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,620
怎么回事
What the hell?

380
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,990
还希望不大呢
Thin lead, huh?

381
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,660
进来吧
Come in.

382
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,730
希望一切都合您心意  夫人
I hope everything is to your satisfaction, ma'am.

383
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,570
我很满意  谢谢你  船长
It is. Thank you, Captain.

384
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,140
假如您想道别的话
You can see Gotham on the horizon

385
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,720
可以在地平线上看到哥谭
if you want to say good-bye.

386
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,760
不需要
No need.

387
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,710
我很快就会回来的
I'll be back soon enough.

388
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,590
那么...
Well...

389
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,510
假如您有任何需要  请告诉我
if you need anything, just let me know.

390
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,490
我会的
I will.

391
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,330
这个幸运儿和之前那个死者
This lucky fellow and the previous victim

392
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,830
都在同一个恐惧症互助组
are both part of the same phobia support group.

393
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,690
怕猪吗  难以想象
Pigs. Go figure.

394
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,530
他怎样了
How is he?

395
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,670
现在在哥谭总院  被吓掉了半条命
He's at Gotham General, scared half to death.

396
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,040
医生得给他注射镇定剂
The medics had to sedate him.

397
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,860
你射杀的那个人  他也是互助组的吗
The man you shot-- was he in this group, too?

398
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,470
不是  目前还没查到身份
Nope. No I.D. as yet.

399
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,390
我们在查他的指纹
We're running his prints.

400
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,430
他就是我们要找的人吗  或者另有其人
So is he our man or are we still looking for someone else?

401
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,930
-难说  -就是他了
- Hard to say. - He's our man.

402
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,980
这种怪人一般都是单干的
These sort of wackos work alone.

403
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,940
我要去趟互助组
I'm gonna run by the support group,

404
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,900
告诉他们已经解决了
tell them it's been settled.

405
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,290
我们还不能确定
Hey, we don't know that yet.

406
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,160
你得乐观点
You need to be more optimistic.

407
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,630
的确  你是得乐观点
You do. You need to be more optimistic.

408
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,950
我们抓到了一个罪犯
We have a perp.

409
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,610
第一个死者的死后切口很奇怪
The postmortem incision on the first victim is weird.

410
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,890
凶手在寻找什么  我想弄清楚
The killer was after something. I want to know what.

411
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,610
我要叫尼格玛去看看
I'm gonna ask Nygma to take a look.

412
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,220
不行  他被停职了
No. He's been suspended.

413
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,220
你只能从法医那里拿报告
You got the report from the M.E.

414
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,640
就那个告诉我之前那个证人是从背后
The same M.E. who said my last witness stabbed himself

415
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,410
用冰锥捅死自己的法医吗
to death in the back with an ice pick?

416
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,150
不要  谢了  尼格玛...
No. No, thanks. Nygma...

417
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,010
不是法医
Is not the medical examiner.

418
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,850
我也喜欢他
I like him, too.

419
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,160
但是以目前的状况  我无能为力
But there's nothing I can do, not with the way things are.

420
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,820
什么意思
What do you mean?

421
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,330
听着  我很高兴我们拿下了弗拉斯
Look, I'm glad we took down Flass,

422
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,450
但是有的人是可以查的  有的人则不能
but there are people you go after and people you don't.

423
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,620
所以  现在我们的一举一动都被盯着
So now everything we do is being watched.

424
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,270
你已经抓到坏人了  放手吧
You got the bad guy. Let it go.

425
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,420
很抱歉您被卷入了这件事
I'm sorry you got dragged into it.

426
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,440
不必感到抱歉
Don't be.

427
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:18,830
那感觉挺好的
Felt good.

428
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,820
是吧
Did, didn't it?

429
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,190
柯林格小姐  我来告诉你我...
Miss Kringle, I came to tell you that I...

430
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,570
你是在哭吗
Have you been crying?

431
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,870
没  没有  我没事
No, no. I'm-I'm fine.

432
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:39,560
但是我能看见你脸上有眼泪
But I can see tears on your face.

433
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,390
是因为你的朋友弗拉斯警探被捕了吗
Is it because your friend Detective Flass was arrested?

434
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,100
你需要什么  尼格玛先生
What do you need, Mr. Nygma?

435
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,790
对了
Yes.

436
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,690
我被停职了  以后都见不到你了
I've been suspended and won't be seeing you anymore.

437
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:51,650
所以我想把这支铅笔还给你
So I wanted to return this pencil.

438
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,610
之前我从你办公室拿的
I took it from your office some time ago.

439
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,120
我一直想还给你的
I kept meaning to return it.

440
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,540
现在短了一些
Used to be longer.

441
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,860
你是个怪人  尼格玛先生
You're an odd man, Mr. Nygma.

442
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,850
但是我对你被停职一事深表遗憾
But I'm sorry that you've been suspended.

443
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,480
真希望有办法挽回
I wish something could be done.

444
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,480
坐吧  我们得谈谈
Have a seat. We got to talk.

445
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,520
我觉得我们现在
I feel that the time has come in our relationship

446
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,510
该相互信任了
when we should have trust with each other.

447
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,680
真正的信任
Real trust.

448
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,470
完全坦诚相待
Total honesty between us.

449
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,700
没有秘密
No secrets.

450
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,890
我百分百同意
I 100% agree.

451
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,740
我先说个秘密
So here's a secret to start off.

452
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,460
根本没什么有事的人  我说了谎
There is no guy with a thing. I lied.

453
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,390
我就觉得奇怪呢
I was beginning to wonder about him.

454
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,220
到你了
Now you.

455
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,750
-我  -既然要坦诚
- Me? - We're being honest.

456
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,770
你也要说个秘密作交换
You have to tell me a secret in return.

457
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,320
对您隐瞒的秘密  马罗尼阁下
Secrets from you, Don Maroni?

458
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,890
我没有
I have none.

459
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,390
说吧
Please.

460
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,650
说实话  我不太喜欢吃燕麦
Honestly... I don't really like oatmeal.

461
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,830
知道了
Good to know.

462
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,210
我喜欢这个游戏
See, I like this game.

463
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,650
我再告诉你个秘密
I'll tell you another secret.

464
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,400
菲什・穆尼还活着
Fish Mooney's alive.

465
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,960
我跟她通过话
I spoke to her.

466
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,790
这秘密劲爆吧
Good secret, huh?

467
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,040
菲什都说什么了
What did Fish say?

468
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,000
不
Oh, no.

469
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,810
你得先还我个秘密
You have to tell me a secret first.

470
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,310
得这么玩
That's how it works.

471
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
我也不太喜欢喝咖啡
I don't much like coffee either.

472
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,980
好吧
Fair enough.

473
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,210
菲什都说了什么
What did Fish say?

474
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,340
说你和法尔科内一直联手合作
Said you and Falcone have been working together all this time.

475
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,120
她说我认识你的第一天开始
She said you've been playing me for a chump

476
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,750
你就把我当白痴一样耍
since the first day I met you.

477
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,660
她当然会这样说  对不对
She would say that, wouldn't she?

478
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,430
贱人
The bitch.

479
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,180
您不会相信她吧
You don't believe her, do you?

480
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,150
我不得不说
Well, she did put some incidents

481
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:31,600
这让人用一种全新而不安的眼光看待很多事
in a different and troubling light, I must say.

482
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,810
那真糟糕
Well, that's too bad.

483
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,470
到你了
Your turn.

484
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,910
再说个秘密吧
Tell me another secret.

485
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,260
这次要个劲爆的
A good one this time.

486
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,190
我拿了你的枪
I took your gun.

487
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,860
就在这儿
I have it right here.

488
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,990
这个够劲爆
That's a good secret.

489
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,150
我拿走它是因为我已经猜到穆尼找到了你
I took it because I figured Mooney had called you somehow.

490
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,650
我就知道你会相信她
I knew you might believe her.

491
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,200
但她说的未必是真话
Doesn't mean she's telling the truth.

492
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,130
是吗
Is she?

493
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,230
你有把我当白痴耍吗  企鹅
Have you been playing me for a chump, Penguin?

494
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,520
轮到你说秘密了
I think it's your turn to tell a secret.

495
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,710
你个小杂种
You little dirtbag.

496
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,830
我当你像朋友一样
I treated you like a friend.

497
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,550
猴子朋友吧
Like a monkey friend.

498
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,210
你是动物园看守  记得吗
You're the zookeeper, remember?

499
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,060
说秘密吧
Tell me a secret now.

500
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,920
那再说一个
Just one more then.

501
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,980
这游戏我玩腻了
I'm tired of this game.

502
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,110
这把枪装的是空弹
That gun is loaded with blanks.

503
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
骗子
Liar.

504
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,920
-你  -没错
- You... - Yeah.

505
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,640
劲爆吧
Good secret, huh?

506
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,180
感谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

507
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,020
很高兴接到你的电话
I was glad to get your call.

508
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,260
阿卡姆还好吗
How are things at Arkham?

509
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,990
你走后就无聊多了
Little less interesting since you've left.

510
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,580
警局还好吧
How are things at the precinct?

511
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,930
其实我就是因为这个想找你帮忙呢
Um, well, actually, that was what I was hoping you could help me with.

512
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,540
我们接到一个案子
Um, we've got this case,

513
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,750
我想不通凶手到底想怎么样
and I can't understand what exactly our perp was doing.

514
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,990
法医又不太靠谱
And our medical examiner is kind of a clown.

515
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,680
有问题吗
Uh, something wrong?

516
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,320
没  没有
No, not at all.

517
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,040
只是  上次见面时  你很热情
Only, last time we met, you were very passionate.

518
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,990
你打给我的时候  我以为...
So when you called me, I thought...

519
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,540
怎么说呢
Well, whatever.

520
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,960
我涂了口红
I put on lipstick.

521
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,920
而你想要鉴证建议
And you want forensic advice.

522
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,780
你把我搞糊涂了
You're very confusing.

523
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,090
我不是故意的
I don't mean to be. Uh...

524
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,070
案子只是借口
Case is a pretext.

525
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,600
我想见你
I wanted to see you.

526
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,360
为什么不直接说
Why didn't you just say that?

527
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,820
是该这样  不过我很久没这么做过了
I should have. I haven't done this in a while.

528
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,960
有些生疏了
I'm a little rusty.

529
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,230
抱歉
Sorry.

530
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,040
好吧
All right.

531
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,220
很好
Well, good.

532
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,440
我可不想涂上口红却会错了意
I don't like to put on lipstick by mistake.

533
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,900
是什么事
So what's the issue?

534
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,250
不不不  别管那案子了
Uh, no, no, no, forget the case.

535
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,920
-不用操心  -没事
- Don't worry. - Please.

536
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,980
我很感兴趣
I'm interested.

537
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,110
失陪一下
Excuse me.

538
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,540
戈登
Gordon.

539
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,770
什么时候
When?

540
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,110
好的  好的
Uh, yeah, okay.

541
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,890
给他录口供  我马上就到
Take his statement. I'll be right there.

542
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,230
很抱歉  我得走了
I'm sorry, I have to go.

543
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,760
没事
I'm fine.

544
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,650
-你确定吗  -是的
- You sure? - Yes.

545
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,280
我会把文件拿给你的
I'll bring this back to you.

546
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,710
我是哈维
It's Harvey.

547
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,770
哈维  第二个受害人醒来了
Harvey, second victim woke up.

548
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,710
他说他是被两个人绑架的
Says he was abducted by two men.

549
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,650
还有人逍遥法外
There's someone still out there.

550
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,380
谢谢你过来告诉我们发生的一切
It's kind of you to come here and tell us what happened.

551
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,140
别客气
No problem.

552
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,590
我只是不想让你担心
I just didn't want you worrying, so...

553
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,590
说实话  我觉得你并不像胆小的人
To be honest, you don't strike me as the fraidy cat type.

554
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,130
恐惧症患者不是胆小鬼
Phobics are not fraidy cats.

555
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,000
我知道  只是你看起来很坚强
I know. It's just, you seem like a strong lady is all.

556
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,260
我是很坚强
I am strong.

557
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,450
我只是碰巧害怕游泳池而已
I just happen to be terrified of swimming pools.

558
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,350
开玩笑吧
You're kidding.

559
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,970
这的确是个问题
Well, I can see how that might be a thing.

560
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,330
几乎人人都有问题
Nearly everyone has a thing.

561
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,950
我敢说  如果你深入内心
I'm sure that you, if you dig deep enough,

562
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,110
也会有需要面对的问题
would have issues that you need to confront.

563
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,180
我是警察  唯一怕的就是低因咖啡
I'm a cop; the only thing I'm scared of is decaf coffee.

564
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,180
真的吗  我发现
Really? I've always found

565
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,150
最优秀最勇敢的人
that the best and bravest people are the ones

566
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,920
往往会坦然承认他们的恐惧
that willingly acknowledge their fears.

567
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,940
也许只是你约会过的人里
Maybe you've just been hanging out

568
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,050
有太多胆小  爱抱怨的人
with too many timid and whiny people.

569
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,700
你真是太坏了
You are so bad.

570
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,800
我总是在害怕
I'm scared all the time.

571
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,290
我愿意
And it's something I'd be

572
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,240
和小组进行分享
willing to share with the group

573
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,810
如果你觉得能对我有帮助的话
if you think it might be helpful.

574
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,500
当然
Yes.

575
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,120
当然  谢谢你
Yes, thank you.

576
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,450
我觉得会有帮助的
I think it would.

577
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,190
第一次
First time?

578
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,860
是的  你呢
Yeah. You?

579
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,280
不是  我一直参加的
No, I'm a regular.

580
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,680
情况是这样的
So here's the deal.

581
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,980
你进到车里
You go in the car,

582
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,570
那辆车已经在粉碎机上了
the car's already in the crusher,

583
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,710
你会被挤压致死
you get squeezed to death,

584
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,360
会用上几分钟才能断气
it takes a couple of minutes to die.

585
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,410
不管出来的是什么  我都会送给法尔科内
Whatever comes out, I send to Falcone.

586
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,310
也许他会拿去做咖啡桌
Maybe he uses it as a coffee table.

587
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,320
马罗尼阁下  请听我说
Don Maroni, please listen to me.

588
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,780
到乞求的部分了吗
Oh, this is the begging part?

589
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,590
很好  因为这是我最爱的部分
Oh, good, 'cause this is my favorite part.

590
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,510
来吧  为你的狗命乞求吧
Go ahead and beg for your miserable life.

591
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,590
容我提议一些选择
Just allow me to suggest some options here.

592
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,020
我死了就毫无价值了
Dead, I'm worthless.

593
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,210
再考虑到法尔科内必然会为此做出报复
If you factor in Falcone's inevitable retaliation,

594
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,410
杀我对您只有损失
killing me will be a net loss for you.

595
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,880
这不是个生意问题
This is not a business issue.

596
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,350
我和弗兰基・卡彭是20多年的朋友了
Me and Frankie Carbone go back 20 years.

597
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,920
你伤了我  企鹅
You hurt me, Penguin.

598
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,710
印第安山的事被您说着了
You were right about Indian Hill.

599
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,160
的确有内幕
There's more to it.

600
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,310
法尔科内知道些内情
Falcone knows something.

601
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,960
我还不知道是什么  但我会查明...
I don't know what, b-but I-I can find out...

602
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,850
够了
Stop it.

603
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,250
我看你都难受
You're making me sad.

604
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,240
我当初怎么就信了你的一派胡言
How did I ever fall for your crap?

605
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,780
不不
N-No.

606
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,340
不要啊
No. No. No.

607
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,650
求您  求您
Please. Please.

608
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,140
不要
No. No.

609
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,780
替我跟弗兰基问个好
Say hi to Frankie for me.

610
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,140
我每天都感到害怕
I'm afraid every day.

611
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,560
我怕自己会死在暗巷里
I'm afraid I'm gonna die in an alley.

612
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,210
慢慢流血至死  而有个人渣却在翻我兜
Bleeding out while some scumbag goes through my pockets

613
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,300
嘲笑我
and laughs at me.

614
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,680
我想说话  却说不出声
And I try to speak, but nothing comes out.

615
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,450
我躺在那里
And I just lie there,

616
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,460
盯着头顶建筑物之间的一小片天空
staring at a small space of sky between the buildings.

617
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,650
然后死去
And then I die.

618
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,350
独自一人
Alone.

619
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,600
我不想独自死在什么破地方
I don't want to die alone in some gutter.

620
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,370
我想死在温暖的床上
I want to die in a warm cozy bed

621
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,100
在一个漂亮女人的怀里
in the arms of a beautiful woman.

622
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,060
多谢分享  哈维
Thank you for sharing, Harvey.

623
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,400
还有别人想分享的吗
Would anyone else like to share?

624
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,110
托德  说吧
Tod, go ahead.

625
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,900
我叫托德
My name is Tod, and...

626
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,490
我以前从未在这里发过言
I've never spoken here before, but...

627
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,890
我特别害怕失败
...I have a horrible terror of failure.

628
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,670
我折磨自己和身边的人
I torment myself and those around me.

629
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,580
为了不失败  我宁可爬碎玻璃
I'd crawl on broken glass to avoid failing.

630
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,130
我愿做任何事
About anything.

631
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,900
这种疾病我是从父亲那里继承来的
I inherited this illness from my father,

632
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:04,360
但恐怕我如今把它传给了儿子
but I'm afraid I'm passing it on to my son.

633
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,710
有我们呢  托德
We're here for you, Tod.

634
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,690
我昨天下班回家
When I came home from work yesterday,

635
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,430
我的宝贝儿子在哭
my precious son was crying,

636
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,410
他对我说  他...
and he said to me that he...

637
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,230
对不起
I'm sorry.

638
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,680
我说不出口
I can't speak.

639
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,100
-很抱歉  -托德
- I'm so sorry. - Tod?

640
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,930
托德
Tod.

641
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,610
托德
Tod?

642
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,820
开什么玩笑  干什么
Oh, you got to be kidding me. What?

643
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,390
马罗尼阁下  您得听我说
Don Maroni, you have to listen to me.

644
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,250
不
Uh, see, no.

645
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,430
这一切就是这么开始的
This is how this all began,

646
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,660
我听你说话
me listening to you.

647
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,060
我说的是实话
I was telling the truth.

648
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,060
关于印第安山  关于阿卡姆
About Indian Hill. And Arkham.

649
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,940
控制了阿卡姆的人将控制哥谭  我可以...
Whoever controls Arkham will control Gotham! I can...

650
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,300
闭上嘴  像个男人一样死吧
Would you shut up and take it like a man?

651
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,490
达夫废车场

652
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,010
你好  是达夫先生吗
Hello, is this Mr. Duffy?

653
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,440
仔细听好了
Listen to me very carefully.

654
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,110
我就是你这台残暴机器碾压的车里的人
I'm the man in the car in this ferocious machine of yours.

655
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:31,890
我名叫奥斯瓦尔德・科波特
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

656
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,160
我为哥谭市的卡麦・法尔科内阁下工作
And I work for Don Carmine Falcone of Gotham City.

657
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,780
你知道法尔科内阁下是谁吗
Do you know who Don Falcone is?

658
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,790
很好  我刚刚给法尔科内阁下打了电话
Good. I just called Don Falcone,

659
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,090
把我在哪和现在的情况都如实告诉了他
and I told him exactly where I am and what's happening.

660
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,530
所以  达夫  你最好赶紧把机器停下
So, Duffy, you better stop this machine right now,

661
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,280
因为如果我死了
because if I die,

662
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,300
法尔科内阁下会派一队人马来
Don Falcone is gonna send a team up here

663
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,990
把你活活剥皮  再杀了你家人
to skin you alive and slaughter your family.

664
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,040
但是马罗尼阁下说
But Don Maroni said...

665
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,340
法尔科内阁下才掌管哥谭
Don Falcone runs Gotham,

666
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,990
你就要杀掉他的得力手下了
and you're about to murder his right-hand man.

667
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,770
搞什么
What the hell?

668
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,350
给我回来
Get back here!

669
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,740
该死的
Son of a bitch.

670
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,580
只有我觉得他俩已经去很久了吗
Is it just me, or have those two been gone a while?

671
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,350
这经历很真实很有趣  但我得走了
This has been real and fun, but I got to go.

672
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,740
天呐
Oh, my God.

673
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,840
不是看上去那样的
This isn't what it looks like.

674
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,050
其他成员说绑架者上个月一直有参与会议
Other members say our abductor's been coming the last month.

675
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,060
自称名字是托德 
Said his name was Tod,

676
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,800
但根据互助组规定  他们是匿名的
but group protocol requires they remain anonymous.

677
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,400
所以查不到真实身份
So no real I.D.

678
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,850
你打中的那个  那个猪人呢
And the guy you shot, the one with the pigs?

679
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,710
指纹结果出来了  是职业罪犯
Prints came back: career criminal.

680
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,750
大概只是动手的  说了算的是另一个
Probably just the muscle. The other guy was in charge.

681
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,090
他知道会议上有个警察
He knew there was a cop there at the meeting.

682
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:57,540
还是劫走了她
He still took her.

683
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,260
这不是冷酷就是疯狂
That's cold or crazy.

684
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,870
不管怎样  他一定会采取同样的犯罪手法
Either way, he's almost sure to follow the same M.O.

685
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,040
他会逼穆伦斯小姐面对最大的恐惧
He'll confront Miss Mullens with her greatest fear.

686
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,150
就是溺水
Which is drowning.

687
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,520
准确说是在泳池里
Specifically in a pool.

688
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,010
哥谭有几百个泳池呢
There's hundreds of pools in Gotham.

689
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,570
-我们不可能每个都顾及到  -她妈妈的电话
- We can't possibly get to every... - That was her mother.

690
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,890
斯科蒂7岁的时候差点淹死在
When she was seven, Scottie almost drowned

691
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,770
上城区的拉马斯公园游泳池
in Lemmars Park pool uptown.

692
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,840
这是个起点吧
It's a start, I guess.

693
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,630
他一定是带她去那儿了  我能感觉到
That's where he took her, I can feel it.

694
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,470
-老大  -不是时候  乔
- Boss? - Uh, not now, Joe.

695
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:22,950
等等
Wait.

696
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,500
那不是我想的那样吧
Tell me that's not what it looks like.

697
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,740
你很勇敢
You're brave.

698
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,110
能给你个8分了
I'd say you're an eight on the Crane Scale.

699
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,450
深度恐惧
Profound fear.

700
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,170
12分是满分
12 is top.

701
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,320
令心脏停跳的深刻恐惧
Abject heart-stopping terror.

702
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:46,280
你只有8真是令我惊讶
I'm surprised you're only an eight.

703
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,110
你明白这事是真的在发生吧
You do understand that this is really happening?

704
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,470
我要淹死你
I'm going to drown you.

705
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,260
就现在
Right now.

706
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,640
好了  到10了
There! That's a ten.

707
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,420
爸爸
Dad.

708
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,190
乔纳森  我叫你在车里等的
, I said to wait in the van.

709
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,380
停车计时器到时间了
The parking meter ran out.

710
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,740
儿子  我知道这很艰难
Look, son, I know this hard,

711
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,420
但我们谈过了
but we talked about it.

712
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,310
这是为了大局  为了人类
It's for the common good, for humanity.

713
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,210
我知道  我只是...我觉得...
I know. I just... I think...

714
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,550
很快就好了  给
This will be over soon. Here.

715
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,530
去投到计时器里
Go and feed the meter.

716
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,560
去吧
Go on, go.

717
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,670
亲爱的  别太怪我
Now, my dear, don't think badly of me.

718
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,830
哥谭市警局
GCPD!

719
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,030
别动
Don't move!

720
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,620
我追他  你救她
I'm on him! You get her!

721
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,170
他还活着
He's alive.

722
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:48,930
我就说他还活着
I told you he was alive.

723
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,440
感谢主
Praise the Lord.

724
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,120
我主仁慈
Glory be.

725
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,640
你是怎么了  孩子
What happened to you, boy?

726
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,790
就如浪子  女士  我堕落了
Like the prodigal son, ma'am, I have fallen.

727
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,630
就像约伯  我被投入最深的不忠深渊
Like Job, I've been tested in the deepest pits

728
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,750
接受试炼  而存活了下来
of the devil's perfidy and survived.

729
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,290
吾主仁慈
Lord have mercy.

730
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,590
你们不会是要去哥谭市吧
Are you headed to Gotham City, by any chance?

731
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,960
是啊  来吧
Sure. Come on.

732
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,020
这是你给我的那个被从楼上扔下去的男人的案卷
Case files you gave me about that man who was thrown from the roof.

733
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,410
你抓到凶手了吗
Did you catch his killer yet?

734
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,130
还没  他还在逃
Uh, no. He's still out there.

735
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,500
我跟踪调查了一下
I followed up,

736
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,180
然后给他做了个尸检
and I had a quick look at his corpse.

737
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,290
你还尸检了
A quick look at his corpse?

738
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,460
就在楼下停尸间里  没什么麻烦的
Yeah, its' just downstairs at the morgue. No trouble.

739
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,260
凶手取走了他的肾上腺
So the killer removed his adrenal glands.

740
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,660
肾上腺  真奇怪
Adrenal glands? That's strange.

741
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,400
这东西在黑市上没有价值吧
They have no value on the black market, do they?

742
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,720
没有  肾和肝脏  有
No. Kidneys and livers, yes.

743
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,840
肾上腺  没有
Adrenal glands, no.

744
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,370
它产生皮质醇
It produces cortisol,

745
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,450
这种激素激发我们的战斗-逃逸反应
the hormone that gives us that adrenalized fight-or-flight reaction.

746
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,780
总之  就是恐惧腺
Essentially, it's the fear gland.

747
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,760
而凶手要在被害人最害怕的时候
And our man wants to take it from the victim

748
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,860
取走他的肾上腺  为什么呢
when he's most fearful. Why do that?

749
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,530
我只能想到  在死亡来临的时刻
All I can think of is that at the moment of death,

750
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,850
被害人的肾上腺能产生
the victim's adrenals would produce a massive,

751
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,980
大量高质的皮质醇
highly-elevated form of cortisol.

752
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,760
很有意思吧
Fascinating, huh?

753
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,140
这人真怪
This is one weird dude.

754
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,040
应该是个医生或护士
A doctor or a nurse, most likely.

755
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,540
他们能把肾上腺切除得那么干净是需要技术的
Takes some skill to remove adrenals as cleanly as they did.

756
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,010
你真的很喜欢这种工作  是吧
You really like this kind of work, huh?

757
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,910
是啊
I do.

758
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,680
很好
Good.

759
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,440
或许今后还有更多机会
Maybe there'll be more for you.

760
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,820
甚至是全职工作
A full-time job, even.

761
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,590
我们的法医因盗取尸块被开除了
Our M.E. has been fired for stealing body parts.

762
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,510
能相信吗
Can you believe that?

763
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,030
在哥谭就不奇怪
Only in Gotham.

764
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:59,820
我们回头谈谈这份可能的工作
So, what do you say we discuss this potential job

765
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,260
一起吃个晚饭吧
over dinner?

766
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,610
说的真圆滑啊
Nice segue, Mr. Smooth.

767
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,390
谢谢
Thank you.

768

晚饭是个好主意

769

你还要带上卷宗吗
Are you gonna bring your case files?

770
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,190
随你嘲笑我生疏的约会技能吧
Go ahead, mock my crude dating skills.

771
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,770
我已经尽力了
I'm doing my best.

772
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,470
你挺好的
You're doing fine.

773

我现在好想吻你
I have a powerful urge to kiss you right now.

774
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:24,940
为什么不呢
Why don't you?

775
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,540
因为我在当班
Because I'm on duty, and, uh...

776
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:36,470
而且有50来个人在看着我们呢
there's about 50 people watching us.

777
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,490
害怕了
Scaredy-cat.

778
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,800
当然  我还得维护形象呢
Damn straight. I have an image to keep up.

779

无情  刻板的硬汉吗
The heartless, by-the-book, hard man.

780
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,110
算是吧
Kind of.

781
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,770
数到三  我就靠过来
On the count of three, I'm gonna lean in,

782
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,240
这样就很自然了
so that it's subtle.

783
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,470
你得吻我的脸颊  否则就别想吃饭了
Then you're gonna kiss me on the cheek or no dinner.

784
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,740
-别这样  -我认真的

788
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,920

I'm not leaving after all.

789

什么
What?

790
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,670
验尸官要走人了
It turns out that the medical examiner is leaving,

791
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,540
所以艾森警监复了我的职
so Captain Essen decided to reinstate me.

792
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,300
好啊
Okay, good.

793
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,240
尼格玛先生
Mr. Nygma?

794

你欠我一只新铅笔
You owe me a new pencil.

795
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,310

What's going on? What's happening?
