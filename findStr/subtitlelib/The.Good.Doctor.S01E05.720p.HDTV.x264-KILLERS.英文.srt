21
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,680
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

22
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,690
How hard can it be to just act like a normal human being?!

23
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,440
No!

24
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,720
Stop petting that stupid rabbit!

25
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,250
We're never going home again.

26
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,100
We have each other, and that's all we need.

27
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,600
My brother went to heaven in front of my eyes.

28
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,860
Never forget, you're the smart one.

29
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,350
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

30
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,430
Dad?

31
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,990
Penny, I missed you, too!

32
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,120
Oh, Penny, come.

33
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,960
Stay.

34
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, Dad.

35
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,530
Sorry it's so early. I just landed.

36
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,230
Actually, you're a bit late.

37
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,620
Five weeks.

38
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,070
I know. I know.

39
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,520
I'm sorry. I-i-it's a long story, okay?

40
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,640
But h-how was it?

41
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,720
It was your mother's funeral.

42
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,210
Dad, I'm...

43
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,030
Okay.

44
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,680
Well, you have my cell number.

45
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,630
It only works if you answer it.

46
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,580
Dad?

47
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,960
Dad?!

48
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,350
Dad!

49
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,410
You okay?

50
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,000
You okay? You can't breathe?!

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,880
No? Okay.

52
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,170
Hold on, I'm gonna call for help, okay?

53
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,500
911? My dad collapsed!

54
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,240
He can't -- he can't breathe, please hurry!

55
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,600
Just hold on, Dad!

56
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,290
Good morning, everyone!

57
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,720
Right on time.

58
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,220
What, did you sleep here or use a teleportation device?

59
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,450
I used a teleportation device.

60
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,870
Nonsensical questions usually imply sarcasm,

61
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,450
which I've found people often answer sarcastically.

62
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,310
Good one.

63
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,380
Trauma wants a consult on a 66-year-old male

64
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,630
who collapsed from severe anaphylaxis,

65
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,680
complicated by respiratory arrest.

66
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,220
His son just got back from Thailand.

67
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,800
Almost immediately, the father had his allergic reaction.

68
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,170
Patient has a few allergies --

69
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,600
pollen, mold, shellfish --

70
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,480
but no corresponding allergens were in evidence.

71
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,130
Why are we doing a surgical consult on an allergy?

72
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,900
Well, we're not.

73
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,480
We're doing a consult on the excruciating abdominal pain he now has.

74
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,090
As you may have heard.

75
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,210
Mr. Wilks, hi, I'm Dr. Neil Melendez.

76
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,670
Heard you had some abdominal pain.

77
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,750
The guy was in some serious pain --

78
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,140
10 milligrams of morphine worth.

79
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,050
Test results show elevated lipase,

80
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,940
amylase, pancreatic enzymes.

81
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,130
Pancreas is enlarged.

82
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,790
Could be pancreatitis, maybe alcohol-induced.

83
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,270
The son said he smelled alcohol on his father 6:00 in the morning.

84
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,920
And anaphylaxis has been known to precipitate attacks of pancreatitis.

85
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,140
Guess that's it, then.

86
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,260
Meaning you totally disagree.

87
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,230
Not everyone who starts their day off with a Mimosa

88
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,560
fries their pancreas.

89
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,050
Your eyesight must a hell of a lot better than mine.

90
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,020
Because I can't see the entire pancreas

91
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,540
due to the overlying bowel gas.

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,680
We'll order an abdominal CT and take a better look.

93
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,540
There you go.

94
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,540
Where the hell is Murphy?

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,040
It's a severe fracture, but I don't think you'll need pins.

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,100
Young bones tend to heal very well.

97
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,000
Young Bones?

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,540
Isn't that a "Star Trek: Origins" graphic novel?

99
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,390
I'm not sure.

100
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,320
No, that was a joke.

101
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,730
Where are your parents?

102
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,670
They're coming.

103
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,170
They both work in the city, so it's a long drive for them.

104
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,060
I was on a school field trip,

105
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,790
and I tripped over my own feet.

106
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,510
Of course, it was right in front of Shelby Lomar.

107
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,920
At least it was pretty gross,

108
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,230
so I got some sympathy points for that.

109
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,660
I would expect this to have been caused by a more serious accident.

110
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,720
Nope, just a trip.

111
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,880
I do that a lot.

112
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,910
What can I say?

113
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,930
I'm clumsy.

114
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,410
Yes. Now follow my finger.

115
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,250
You have some nystagmus --

116
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,480
an involuntary eye movement.

117
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,120
So what's that mean?

118
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,430
When you fell, did you hit your head?

119
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,230
No.

120
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,000
What, you think I have brain damage?

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,870
Nystagmus can be a sign of a neurological issue.

122
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,270
Well, that would explain the "C" I got in social studies.

123
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,740
That was another joke, wasn't it?

124
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,360
I'm going to order a head CT for you.

125
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,210
Go for it.

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,660
- Shaun, are you getting any sleep? - Yes.

127
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,690
Really? I mean, really getting sleep?

128
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,990
I got here on time.

129
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,980
Well, that's good.

130
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,090
I used a teleportation device.

131
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,820
Radiology form, please.

132
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,690
Shaun, that boy, he looks like...

133
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,720
Steve. He does.

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,480
Is he related?

135
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,840
His name is Evan Gallico, so I don't think so.

136
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,750
That is uncanny.

137
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,160
Just coincidental.

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,440
He looks exactly like your brother.

139
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,270
No, he doesn't.

140
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,690
His hair is shorter.

141
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,530
It freaks me out. It doesn't freak you out?

142
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,290
No.

143
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,050
It's okay if it does --

144
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,390
No, he's not Steve. Steve's dead.

145
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,650
"I used a teleportation device" was a joke.

146
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,740
Yeah, that's...that's good.

147
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,370
So, I couldn't come to Mom's funeral because I fell in love.

148
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,890
She was another teacher at the school.

149
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,220
A Thai woman.

150
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,600
And she was kind and --

151
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,260
and beautiful and loving...

152
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,590
and very, very sick.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,240
She had a congenital heart defect.

154
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,380
Look, if you don't want to tell me

155
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,560
where you've been for the last six months, then don't.

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,520
It's your business.

157
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,320
But don't insult my intelligence.

158
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
Well, I couldn't just leave her.

159
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,450
You couldn't leave her for five minutes to make a phone call?

160
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,590
This a bad time?

161
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,680
No, come in.

162
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,880
According to the CT,

163
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,540
you have a lesion on your pancreas.

164
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,110
Well, what do you think this lesion could be?

165
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,020
Not sure.

166
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,580
That's why we need to biopsy it.

167
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,920
It could just be a benign cyst.

168
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,740
Or...?

169
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,460
Or...

170
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,110
it could be cancer, right?

171
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,660
We'll know soon enough.

172
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,430
This won't take long.

173
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,600
I know. I've had two of these.

174
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,520
One more and I get my Scout badge.

175
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,690
That was funny.

176
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,350
Tough to tell without looking at you,

177
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,590
but I'm guessing that was sarcasm.

178
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,030
No. I have autism,

179
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,770
which makes it hard for me to read social cues.

180
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,360
Jokes are difficult.

181
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,970
I used to know a kid with autism. Peter.

182
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,320
He was kind of weird but super nice.

183
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,940
Used to know?

184
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,020
You don't know him anymore?

185
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,100
He died.

186
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,880
Hit by a car.

187
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,610
You know anyone who died?

188
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,760
My brother.

189
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,420
That sucks.

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,190
Why did you have the other CT scans?

191
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,650
My parents have...

192
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,610
uh, what's the word for fear of getting sick?

193
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,430
Hypochondriasis?

194
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,240
no, worse than that.

195
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,060
They have...nosophobia.

196
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,260
I love that word.

197
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,350
What do you think of Miss Gannett?

198
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,770
She's nice.

199
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,170
I think she's callipygian.

200
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,980
She's what?

201
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,640
Callipygian?

202
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,560
It means "having shapely buttocks," Shaun.

203
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,790
You read the dictionary.

204
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,650
What it lacks in plot, it makes up for in vocab.

205
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,770
So, you married?

206
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,610
Girlfriend?

207
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,950
Boyfriend?

208
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,950
Tropical fish?

209
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,680
I like Lea.

210
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,630
And who's Lea?

211
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,200
Lea is a friend.

212
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,750
A friend you date?

213
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,990
A friend with benefits?

214
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,320
I lend her batteries sometimes.

215
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,520
I like where this is going...

216
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,750
So, you know, keep going.

217
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,680
'Cause if you don't, I will.

218
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,900
It's kind of my thing, you know?

219
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,360
Just constant talking -- annoys everyone.

220
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,140
- Murphy. - Well, I guess not everyone.

221
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,400
My family's pretty used to me now. I mean...

222
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,660
my friends are very talkative as well, so...

223
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,100
You're giving the fractured arm a head CT?

224
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,670
- Yes. - Get back to the pancreas.

225
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,600
He's not clumsy.

226
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
He has a brain tumor behind the inner ear.

227
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,980
Forget the pancreas.

228
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,930
Mr. And Mrs. Gallico?

229
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,910
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

230
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,090
I'm treating your son.

231
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,120
Well, how is he?

232
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,570
We were told it was a bad break,

233
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,210
but it should heal no problem.

234
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,850
I know why Evan tripped.

235
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,590
He had a tumor in the temporal bone behind his left ear,

236
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,220
which is affecting his balance.

237
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,830
I've arranged for a consult with Dr. Najid in oncology

238
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,140
- and she's going... - No, that won't be necessary. We...

239
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,020
We already have an oncologist.

240
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,730
Evan's been diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma.

241
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,210
He was complaining of a sore shin.

242
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,940
The last thing that we expected was bone cancer.

243
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,780
The doctors at SFM, they gave him a year to live.

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,470
That was seven months ago.

245
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,050
Osteosarcoma explains the severity of his fracture --

246
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,050
he will need pins in his arm after all.

247
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,790
can we see him?

248
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,830
Yes. He's in room 414.

249
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,580
Dr. Murphy?

250
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,150
He doesn't know about his diagnosis.

251
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,420
We would really like to keep it that way.

252
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,740
He's the patient.

253
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,640
Doesn't he have the right to know the truth?

254
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,850
Well, no. He's also a minor, so, no, he doesn't.

255
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,290
Evan's very intelligent --

256
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,330
he'd be able to handle it.

257
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,980
Well, Shaun, maybe it's not just about Evan.

258
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,580
Maybe it's about his parents, as well.

259
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,740
Maybe it's just too difficult for them to tell Evan right now.

260
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,560
I don't know.

261
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,210
Then they're the ones who shouldn't be told.

262
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,730
Well, let me ask you this, Shaun --

263
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,700
what's so wrong about Evan being allowed

264
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,960
to enjoy as much of his life as possible?

265
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,150
Evan wants to know the truth.

266
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,360
How do you know that?

267
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,050
If this were Steve, if this were your brother,

268
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,070
would he want to know the truth?

269
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,460
Is that what this is?

270
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,420
Dad's such a tool.

271
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,010
I found my birthday present in their closet,

272
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,230
right where they always hide it.

273
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,340
I was just about to open it when Dad caught me snooping and freaked out.

274
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,340
I hate all that phony surprise stuff.

275
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,410
It's an AquaBlast Water Cannon.

276
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,160
I was with Mom when she bought it.

277
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,940
Thank you, Shaun.

278
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,190
Your honesty's refreshing!

279
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,580
Yes, he would want to know the truth.

280
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,310
Well, there's nothing we can do about it.

281
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,340
It's not your decision -- it's theirs.

282
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,440
He's their son.

283
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,550
Claire, I need you.

284
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,910
Sure, what's up?

285
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,380
I need someone to lie for me.

286
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,700
Okay...

287
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,550
I'm flattered?

288
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,230
Hey, doc?

289
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,110
There's something I need to tell my dad.

290
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,880
We haven't moved him. He's still in room, uh, 326.

291
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,250
Do you have a medical question for me?

292
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,190
Is he dying?

293
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,460
We don't know yet.

294
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,530
The biopsy will tell us more.

295
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,340
Okay.

296
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,690
My dad is a good guy.

297
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,780
We've just never been on the same page, you know?

298
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,900
My mother was the one that I could talk to --

299
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,050
same for him.

300
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,410
So, without her,

301
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,560
we're both pretty useless.

302
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,530
Room 326.

303
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,870
Right.

304
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,090
Dr. Murphy called me in for a second opinion.

305
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,310
you need some pins in your arm.

306
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,870
Why? What's changed?

307
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:33,160
Well, after studying the radiology report,

308
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,750
given how bad the break is,

309
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,770
we just think it would be a prudent step

310
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,730
to ensure an efficient and thorough mending to the break.

311
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,010
Will I be able to play baseball again?

312
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,540
Well, I don't see why not,

313
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,420
once it's completely healed, after some physiotherapy.

314
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
How long before I can pitch?

315
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,590
It's hard to say.

316
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,980
He wanted someone to lie for him.

317
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,120
And he picked you.

318
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,530
Merrill's son asked for personal advice.

319
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,550
And he picked you.

320
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,740
I know, right?

321
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,210
He's lying to his dad about something.

322
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,010
Yeah? What?

323
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,220
I don't know.

324
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,930
You didn't ask?

325
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:18,460
It didn't seem relevant, medically.

326
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,580
You know it's not that difficult to be a human being.

327
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,880
Just tell him to "come clean,"

328
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,990
"Honesty is the best policy,"

329
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
"A lie is a stone in your heart."

330
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,230
Who said the last one?

331
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,160
Me.

332
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,890
I made it up.

333
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,860
And...I got it.

334
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,430
He's anaphylactic.

335
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,380
- Would you get me an epi? - I'm coming out.

336
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,460
The throat's constricting. Pull the tube.

337
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,800
So, what's up with "Dr. Browne"?

338
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,330
She's Lea, isn't she?

339
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,160
Claire is my colleague.

340
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,460
Oh, come on, I saw the way you were looking at her.

341
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:12,460
How?

342
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,600
I don't think I look like that.

343
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,080
Okay, so then why'd you call her in for a "consult"?

344
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,240
Okay.

345
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,210
Yes, she's better at talking to people than I am.

346
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,000
I counted like 50 tells there.

347
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,960
- You really suck at lying. - I know.

348
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,350
Too bad. It's an important social skill.

349
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,430
So how do you know when to lie?

350
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,010
When people need to know things,

351
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,880
they need to know.

352
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,050
If they don't,

353
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,150
lie through your teeth and feel good about it.

354
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,730
What if they need to know the truth,

355
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,020
but it'll hurt them?

356
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,690
Some can handle it, some can't.

357
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,040
So how do you know who can and who can't?

358
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,340
You tell the truth.

359
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,620
If they like you after, then you'll know.

360
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,120
If they don't?

361
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,880
Then it doesn't really matter anyway.

362
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,850
You have cancer.

363
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,680
Yeah, I know.

364
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,370
My parents took me in for a sore leg.

365
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,650
After a whole bunch of tests,

366
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,990
they talked to the doctor,

367
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,050
then came out and told me I was fine.

368
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,040
That's it. Just "fine."

369
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,030
The next day, they bought me a PS4.

370
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:45,160
So I Googled my symptoms,

371
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,750
and I narrowed it down to osteosarcoma or growing pains.

372
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,240
Kids don't get gaming systems for growing pains.

373
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,150
It's okay.

374
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,610
I'm not afraid to die.

375
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,600
You're not?

376
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,020
Well, I mean, the dying part will suck if it hurts, but...

377
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,980
I'm not afraid about the actual death part.

378
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,290
Because you believe you're going to Heaven?

379
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:14,980
Because I don't.

380
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,590
If I believe in Heaven,

381
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,040
then I got to believe in God,

382
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,340
then I got to believe God made me sick.

383
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,190
How messed up is that?

384
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,540
It's just easier to think that it's all random.

385
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,190
And when it's over, it's just...

386
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,190
over.

387
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,620
So what about Lea?

388
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,740
Where'd you guys meet?

389
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,580
In the hallway.

390
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,430
That's a beautiful story.

391
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,940
Yes. She's my neighbor.

392
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,780
Convenient.

393
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,750
He had another allergic reaction.

394
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,460
- The pancreas? - Merrill Wilks, yeah.

395
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,610
And the second attack was even more severe than the first.

396
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,800
It coincided with biopsying the pancreatic lesion,

397
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
which now appears was a cyst.

398
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,410
Well, now we know he's allergic to whatever's in that cyst.

399
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,030
We also know that the next cyst that pops will probably kill him.

400
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,400
Well, if there is a next.

401
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,670
Let's run a couple tests,

402
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,040
see if there's any evidence of parasites.

403
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,170
And MRI his entire body --

404
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,040
if we're lucky,

405
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,690
he only had the two cysts and he can go home.

406
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,340
Are you looking for loopholes?

407
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,970
Hoping to save Evan?

408
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,740
Everyone makes mistakes.

409
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,970
Which means you should double-check every file in the hospital.

410
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,780
The oncologist flagged his

411
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,980
neutrophil count of 634 as low.

412
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,140
That is low.

413
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,190
Low normal.

414
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,470
I can still hear the word "Low" In there.

415
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,730
He's just a kid.

416
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,600
I know how hard it is to think of him dying.

417
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,700
He's okay with that.

418
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,420
I find that hard to believe.

419
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,650
We all die --

420
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,800
if we accepted that, we'd be happier.

421
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,460
Maybe. But we're not good with contentment.

422
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,830
Fighting death is what keeps us alive.

423
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,680
We got a hit -- Echinococcus.

424
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,780
Echinococcus?

425
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,330
The cysts are filled with tapeworms?

426
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,000
Cysts? There are more?

427
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,910
Three more?

428
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,830
Four more. You missed the one in his brain.

429
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,890
- Dr. Glassman? - Yeah?

430
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,810
You used to be a neurosurgeon, right?

431
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,920
So they say.

432
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,450
Take this, will you?

433
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:41,890
I need one. Who would you recommend?

434
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:42,950
What you got?

435
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,670
That's cool.

436
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,980
How the hell did I get tapeworms in my head?

437
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,830
No idea, but you do.

438
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,450
You can pick up the eggs from coyotes or wolves.

439
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,400
You been hanging around coyotes or wolves?

440
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,760
I live in the suburbs --

441
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,090
we don't even have a petting zoo.

442
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,410
You might've had these cysts for quite some time.

443
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,960
When one of them burst,

444
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,170
that's what caused the first allergic reaction.

445
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,670
Well, why did it burst?

446
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,240
Why did it burst?

447
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,650
Any sudden movements, twists, turns, squeeze.

448
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,040
A hug?

449
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,740
Could be.

450
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,010
But you weren't there for the second one.

451
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,690
I punctured the cyst on your pancreas during the biopsy.

452
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,850
As you've seen, allergic reactions get worse each time they happen.

453
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,500
So a third one, that would be bad.

454
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,420
That would be...

455
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,090
That would be very bad.

456
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,800
So we're gonna have to surgically remove all the cysts intact.

457
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,470
Dr. Glassman's one of the most highly acclaimed

458
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,540
neurosurgeons in the state.

459
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,870
You are very lucky to have him.

460
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,400
And Dr. Kalu is fast becoming a very accomplished flatterer.

461
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,860
The cranial cyst, that is a big deal.

462
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,260
We're gonna have to take off the top of your skull.

463
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,400
You'd be digging in to my brain?

464
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,050
Well, yeah, pretty much.

465
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,040
With saline.

466
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,930
We use it to gently displace the cyst,

467
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,960
and then, poof, it magically pops out.

468
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,370
Kind of like delivering a baby.

469
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,530
You know, if childbirth were painless.

470
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,240
And then we move on to the other cysts.

471
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,200
Hey, we're gonna take good care of you.

475
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,780
Evan doesn't have cancer.

476
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,930
It might not be cancer!

477
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,030
It might not be cancer!

478
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,510
Look at you on time -- two for two.

479
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,130
It might not be cancer.

480
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,590
- Fractured arm? - Yes.

481
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,760
You said he'd been diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma.

482
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,520
Evan was diagnosed with the flu eight months ago,

483
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,270
but his symptoms were actually a better fit with Epstein-Barr virus,

484
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,430
which is linked to Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

485
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,410
which causes osteolytic lesions in the long bones of the upper limbs.

486
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,290
And those lesions could be misdiagnosed as signs of osteosarcoma.

487
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,650
- Yes. - What about his brain tumor?

488
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,100
Langerhans can also manifest in the skull.

489
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,950
Instead of a death sentence,

490
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,150
he could have something that could easily be treated with prednisone?

491
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,400
Next, we need to do a bone-marrow aspiration to confirm.

492
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,950
I assume you've looked at his file.

493
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,110
For a very long time.

494
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,350
Well, there must've been a biopsy.

495
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,680
What did the pathology report say?

496
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,950
Yes. There were two biopsies.

497
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,240
Both were positive for osteosarcoma.

498
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,610
- Murphy... - They could be false positives.

499
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,320
Do you have any idea how unlikely it is to have two false positives?

500
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,130
0.3%.

501
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,090
Which we can comfortably round off to "not likely."

502
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,330
It is possible --

503
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,540
Yes, but it means telling the parents of a dying child

504
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,670
that there's hope, when really there isn't.

505
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,700
Grab a shower and get ready for rounds.

506
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,750
- Imaginative and creative. - Yes.

507
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,010
What are the chances you're right?

508
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,000
0.3%.

509
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,300
330 to 1.

510
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,170
333 to 1.

511
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,380
You really think that it's worth putting Evan's parents through all this?

512
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,420
Of course.

513
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,750
If we did this 333 times,

514
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,170
we'd be giving false hope to 332 people

515
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,660
for approximately four hours,

516
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,890
and we'd save one life.

517
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,170
Isn't that worth it?

518
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,550
Anyway, Dr. Melendez won't let me ask for consent to test.

519
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,580
What if I don't tell them what I'm doing?

520
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,620
A blatant ethics violation -- that's your solution?

521
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,440
Yes.

522
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,090
How do I do that?

523
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,280
You do it and then don't tell anyone. No one.

524
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,370
If anyone asks...

525
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,080
your attending noticed a low RBC count and needed to find the cause...

526
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,210
that's it -- no biggie.

527
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,320
You know Wilks' Grocery on Santa Clara 17th?

528
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,680
It's been an institution for nearly 60 years.

529
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,770
My grandparents started it in 1958,

530
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,470
and my wife and I took it over in '82.

531
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,120
But when my wife got sick

532
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,200
and I started talking to Kevin about taking it over,

533
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,840
he just... took off.

534
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:18,010
To him, it was just a place to sell lettuce and toilet paper.

535
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,250
My father chairs a real-estate development company in the U.K.

536
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,950
Thought I'd be the perfect person to set up the U.S. office.

537
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,420
You wanted to be in the "helping profession" ?

538
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,160
I wanted to be in my profession.

539
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,420
It's not about how small or how big the venture is,

540
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,620
it's about doing something that's yours.

541
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,680
I guess.

542
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,390
When he was little, we were inseparable.

543
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,450
he used to love to come to the store to "work."

544
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,420
I even had a little apron made for him --

545
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,880
had his name on it, too.

546
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,630
Still, you know, kids...

547
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,080
grow up.

548
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm just grateful that he stayed close to his mother.

549
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,800
He could talk to her, tell her anything.

550
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,140
So could I.

551
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,760
And when she went...

552
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,620
I lost them both.

553
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,770
Looks like he's back now.

554
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,470
All I know is he ditched me when I needed him.

555
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,560
Well, you know, as a wise person once said,

556
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,080
"Holding a grudge is a stone in your heart."

557
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,810
What's that for?

558
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,920
Local anaesthetic for a bone-marrow aspiration.

559
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,670
Why do I need a bone-marrow aspiration?

560
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
My attending saw a low RBC count

561
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,360
and wants to find the cause --

562
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,580
no biggie.

563
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,380
"No biggie"?

564
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,550
You're lying.

565
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,060
What's going on?

566
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,420
You already told me I have terminal cancer,

567
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,790
what's worse than that?

568
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,200
You might not.

569
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,260
It might not be osteosarcoma --

570
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,090
might be Langerhans cell histiocytosis,

571
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,210
which is treatable.

572
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,810
Treatable?

573
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,070
As in, I might not die?

574
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,010
That's why I need to aspirate to find out for sure.

575
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,410
Do my parents know?

576
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,080
I was told not to get their hopes up.

577
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,590
Then let's do it before they get back.

578
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,310
Roll onto your side.

579
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,230
Is there a Scout badge for aspirations?

580
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,100
I think someone just made a joke.

581
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,630
Hello.

582
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,500
What are you doing?

583
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,390
Painkiller.

584
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,020
My arm hurts.

585
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,190
That wouldn't explain why I'd be injecting your lumbar region.

586
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,520
Okay. Yes, hello.

587
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,660
I think Evan may have been misdiagnosed with cancer.

588
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,020
I think he has something that creates bone lesions

589
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,500
that look like osteosarcoma.

590
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,470
It's a small chance, 0.3%, but I --

591
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,400
You -- You told Evan that he has cancer?

592
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,750
And now you are telling him -- and us that he doesn't?

593
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,080
I'm telling you he might not.

594
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,180
That's why I need to perform this aspiration.

595
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,350
He says whatever I have might be treatable.

596
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,940
Are you insane?

597
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,200
No. I am not insane.

598
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,250
I thought you'd be happy.

599
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,580
There is a significant link between

600
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,370
Langerhans cell histiocytosis and --

601
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,740
Go! Get out!

602
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,840
Let me get you some water.

603
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,860
- Oh, my God! - Hands right here --

604
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,120
Right here!

605
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,140
Respiratory, stat!

606
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,360
He has a massive embolus,

607
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,490
probably thrown from his fracture.

608
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:21,440
It's located at the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries.

609
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,230
He's close to hemodynamic collapse.

610
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,330
Yeah, no kidding.

611
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,760
I'd like to assist.

612
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,180
Not a chance.

613
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,540
Okay. I'd like to assist.

614
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,790
You're obviously too close to the case.

615
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,970
I think I'm just the right amount of close.

616
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,460
Murphy, you lied to the parents

617
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,400
just so you could try to prove your ridiculous theory.

618
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,520
You're too damn close.

619
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,660
Saddle embolism, scrub in.

620
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,150
We have to get rid of the embolus before he arrests.

621
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,990
His heart is barely pumping blood.

622
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,180
I can feel the pulmonary artery...

623
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,710
I just need to find the obstruction...there!

624
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,520
I got it.

625
00:30:58,570 --> 00:30:59,270
Knife.

626
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,540
- Knife. - EKG is showing right heart strain.

627
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,690
He can't take this much longer.

628
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,280
I know, but if I move any quicker,

629
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,680
I could nick the left main artery and kill the boy.

630
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,280
The phrase "No biggie" gave me away.

631
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,490
You really got to learn how to lie, Shaun.

632
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,610
Am I in trouble?

633
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,860
Yes.

634
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,820
Unless you're right.

635
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,620
If I'm wrong, they shouldn't be upset.

636
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,850
They know it's highly unlikely.

637
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:34,620
False hope, Shaun... it's just plain cruel.

638
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,640
He talk to you?

639
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,830
Did you talk to him?

640
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,860
I don't know what to tell him.

641
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,980
You love your father, don't you?

642
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,500
Yeah, of course.

643
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,710
Right. Well, he's about to go in for brain surgery.

644
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,510
There's huge risks involved.

645
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,160
Whatever this lie is,

646
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,510
can you live the rest of your life knowing you kept it from him?

647
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,330
My -- My girlfriend wasn't sick.

648
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,350
Okay? She dumped me.

649
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,580
She's married with two kids --

650
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,400
had no intention of leaving them.

651
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,300
I-I was an idiot.

652
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,530
You got your heart broken, that's the problem here?

653
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,820
No -- no, Dad.

654
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,630
The problem is...

655
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,080
I didn't run away to Thailand

656
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,220
because I thought Wilks' Grocery was beneath me.

657
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,010
I was afraid that I would never be able to fill your shoes...

658
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,470
And then I proved myself right.

659
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,720
Left pulmonary artery's open.

660
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,970
Ring Forceps.

661
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,350
Ring Forceps.

662
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,350
Come on.

663
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,310
Got it.

664
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,510
EKG is normalizing.

665
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,730
He's okay.

666
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,790
Nice job.

667
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:43,130
All right, flush the left pulmonary artery and close him up.

668
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,010
Okay.

669
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,080
Dr. Melendez...

670
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,130
Take a look at this.

675
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,380
Recycling -- Shaun, very responsible.

676
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,390
It's a book.

677
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,050
I appreciate that.

679
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,230
Thanks, Shaun.

680
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,400
We got the embolism.

681
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,970
He's in recovery and he's doing fine.

682
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,520
But while we were in there, we did find something else.

683
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,540
Lesions on his ribs.

684
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,230
Irrefutable proof of osteosarcoma.

685
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,530
It's metastasized to his chest cavity.

686
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:17,990
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,590
I'm very sorry.

689
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,120
Give that a nice, warm saline bath.

690
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,420
Forceps and Taylor scissors, please.

691
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,530
Forceps and Taylor scissors.

692
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,260
Thank you.

693
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,850
Look at that.

694
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,180
That's what built the pyramids,

695
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,040
painted the Mona Lisa,

696
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,930
invented the Internet.

697
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,550
There is our interloper.

698
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,710
Squeezeball please, Deidre.

699
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,200
Squeezeball?

700
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,970
His name for it, not ours.

701
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:29,320
The saline gently displaces the cyst

702
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,120
and coaxes it out of its little hiding place --

703
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,920
Hopefully in one piece so we don't have to call 911.

704
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,350
Come on, now...

705
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,620
Tray, please.

706
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,630
There we go...

707
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,210
A little bit more...

708
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,350
And there we go.

709
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,820
Got it.

710
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,720
He has his father's eyes.

711
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,880
That was incredible.

712
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,380
One down, three to go...

713
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,540
There he is.

714
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,660
Hi, Sweetie.

715
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,600
What's the matter?

716
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,910
Nothing.

717
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,460
We're just happy you did so great.

718
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,170
You had what's called an embolism.

719
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,100
It clogged an artery in your lungs.

720
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,140
But the good news is they got it.

721
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,500
And you're gonna be just fine.

722
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,740
Still...

723
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,920
too bad about the cancer, huh?

724
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,030
No, no, no, no.

725
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,160
The doctor did not know what he was talking about --

726
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,070
Dad, I know all about it.

727
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,560
I have for a long time.

728
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,230
I --

729
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,620
I am so sorry.

730
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,920
It's okay.

731
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,730
Because I'm not gonna be alone.

732
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,330
Grandma's gonna be there, too.

733
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,050
Auntie Arlene.

734
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,050
Uncle Jim, if he figured out how to stop swearing.

735
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,720
I'll get you some water, buddy.

736
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,430
So, I took Penny for a walk -- just around the block.

737
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:49,790
And I picked her up some of those rawhide treats,

738
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,540
you know...

739
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,900
the ones that Mom used to like to give to her.

740
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,800
I miss her, Dad.

741
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,680
Coast is clear?

742
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,070
Yes.

743
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,080
Thank you.

744
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,830
I was wrong.

745
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,010
You tried.

746
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,480
I was wrong.

747
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,880
Your parents hate me.

748
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,630
I know.

749
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,950
- I gave you false hope. - Yeah.

750
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,840
But for a minute there, it was pretty awesome.

751
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,840
I'm going to ask you for a favor.

752
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,180
Well, I'm not giving away my Make-A-Wish.

753
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,680
Would you mind if I read you something?

754
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
It's not long.

755
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,120
That I can do.

757
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,600
Atticus was right.

758
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,350
One time he said you never really know a man

759
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,590
until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.

760
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,620
Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.

761
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,060
The streetlights were fuzzy

762
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,090
from the fine rain that was falling

763
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,920
As I made my way home,

764
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,470
I felt very old...

765
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:51,300
{\an1}BGM: Run The Jewels by Run The Jewels

766
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:49,070

769
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,920
Atticus, he was real nice.

770
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,370
His hands were under my chin,

771
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,780
pulling up the cover,

772
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,240
tucking it around me.

773
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,840
Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.

774
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,580
He turned out the light and went into Jem's room.

775
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,100
He would be there all night,

776
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,940
and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning.

777
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,430
Sounds like a good book.

778
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,680
Could've used a spoiler alert, though.

779
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,200
Thank you.
