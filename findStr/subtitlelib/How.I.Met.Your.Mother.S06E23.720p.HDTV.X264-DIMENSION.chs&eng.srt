老爸老妈浪漫史
第六季  第二十三集

10
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,710
<i>孩子们  这是一个关于里程碑的故事</i>
<i>Kids, this is a story</i> <i>of landmarks.</i>

11
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,910
<i>人生中总会有一些时刻  让你不得不决定</i>
<i>There are certain moments in</i> <i>life when you have to decide</i>

12
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,180
<i>哪些事物你可以强忍它被拆毁的痛楚</i>
<i>which things you can stand</i> <i>to see torn down,</i>

13
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,780
<i>而哪些事物  你坚持要保留</i>
<i>and which things you have to preserve,</i>

14
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,080
<i>赴汤蹈火在所不惜</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

15
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,720
<i>2011年5月  在纽约城市地标保护委员会</i>
<i>Such a moment came for all of us in May of 2011,</i>

16
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,890
<i>一次特殊会议上</i>
<i>at a special meeting of

17
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,590
<i>我们所有人都面临着这样一刻</i>
<i>the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission,</i>

18
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,030
<i>因为阿卡迪亚的命运</i>
<i>where the fate of The Arcadian

19
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,630
<i>将就此宣判</i>
<i>would be decided</i> <i>once and for all.</i>

20
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,430
阿卡迪亚的石狮
A symbol of strength and constancy,

21
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,870
是力量与忠诚的象征
the stone lion of The Arcadian

22
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,800
它已经见证了几代纽约人的成长
has watched over New Yorkers for generations.

23
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,770
所以请记住
So remember:

24
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,240
如果石狮头象征着帝王风范
if the lion head stonework is regal,

25
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,380
那么拆毁它  实属目无王法
then tearing it down should be illegal.

26
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,120
你们喜欢这么说  那好
Did you like that? All right, uh...

27
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
我们必须确保  石狮永存
We must make sure the lion is always there.

28
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
想毁了阿卡迪亚
Destroy The Arcadian?

29
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,020
不  量你没胆
Oh, no, don't you dare.

30
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,760
怎么样  怎么样  好
Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

31
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,130
再听这句试试
Try this one on for size...

32
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,670
如果想让纽约的历史发展如你所愿
If you want New York's history at your beck and call...

33
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,630
好了  谢谢你  艾瑞克森先生
All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen.

34
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,970
我快说完了
I just have...

35
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,740
我们现在要听取国家巨人银行大楼
We will now hear from the architect

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,280
工程提案的建筑师
of the proposed GNB Tower,

37
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,480
泰德・莫斯比的陈述
Ted Mosby.

38
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,080
现在
Now, uh,

39
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,750
莫斯比先生  我们直奔主题吧
Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase.

40
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,520
你认为阿卡迪亚该成为地标建筑吗
Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?

41
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,630
好吧  我受不了了
Okay, it's killing me.

42
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,000
和"如你所愿"押韵的下句是什么
What rhymes with "beck and call?"

43
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,740
毁灭大球
Wrecking ball.

44
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,910
别去挥舞毁灭大球
Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,080
谢谢你
Thank you.

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,130
莫斯比先生
Mr. Mosby,

47
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,230
你认为阿卡迪亚该成为地标建筑吗
do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?

48
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,560
这问题不难
It's not a difficult question.

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,530
<i>这问题其实很难</i>
<i>It</i> was <i>a difficult question.</i>

50
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,900
<i>当然  如果他早几天问我</i>
<i>Of course, had he asked me</i> <i>a few days earlier,</i>

51
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,840
<i>我会毫不犹豫地回答</i>
<i>I would have</i> <i>immediately said...</i>

52
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,740
"当然  阿卡迪亚应该成为地标建筑"
"Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark."

53
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,740
两天前

54
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,110
然后群众一片沸腾  "天啊"
And then the crowd gasps: "Oh, my God!

55
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,480
"他真这么说了吗"
"Did he really just say that?

56
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,710
"我的老天爷"
"Oh, heavens!"

57
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,940
"我的上帝"
"Oh, my stars!"

58
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,810
"我要护好我的珍珠项链"[形容格外激动]
"I must clutch my pearls!"

59
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,050
这么说  与会的都是些南方老妇人吗
So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?

60
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,150
差不多吧  但我的观点是
Almost exclusively. But here's my point:

61
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,820
如果他们问巨人银行的总建筑师  也就是本人
If they ask GNB's chief architect-- aka me--

62
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,390
阿卡迪亚该不该成为地标建筑
if The Arcadian should be a landmark,

63
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,990
而我说"应该"的话
and I say "yes"?

64
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,260
错了  这不是形容阿卡迪亚被摧毁的样子
That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed;

65
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,070
是巨人银行摧毁阿卡迪亚希望破灭的样子
that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.

66
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,240
-抱歉  我应该表达得更清楚点  -没事
- I'm sorry, I should have been more clear. - Yeah.

67
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,440
阿卡迪亚一定会是这样
The Arcadian's gonna be all like...

68
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,270
没错
Nice.

69
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,570
我来给巴尼传口信
I have a message from Barney.

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240
<i>近来巴尼与我们其他人的关系</i>
<i>Things between Barney</i> <i>and the rest of us</i>

71
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,910
<i>有点僵持不下</i>
<i>had gotten a little frosty.</i>

72
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,610
<i>一开始  祸起萧墙</i>
<i>First this happened.</i>

73
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,320
见见我为阿卡迪亚新聘请的律师吧
Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.

74
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,750
<i>紧接着  祸不单行</i>
<i>And then this happened.</i>

75
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,660
什么样的人渣才会
What kind of dirtbag

76
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,590
背弃自己最好的朋友  却反过来
doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead,

77
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,910
支持一个为了一件毫无意义的事情
sides with some self-righteous bitch

78
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,540
整天拿着扩音器瞎吼  自以为是的贱货
with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!

79
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:09,960
伙计
Dude!

80
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,900
你说的可是我的女朋友
That's my girlfriend.

81
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,730
而你知道吗
And ya know what?

82
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,670
我现在也支持她
I'm on her side now, too.

83
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,370
<i>于是祸及池鱼</i>
<i>Which led to this happening.</i>

84
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,370
巴尼的口信  这是要让我回避吧
Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave.

85
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,780
晚安  各位
Good night, guys.

86
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,040
-我爱你  -我也爱你
- I love you. Mmm. - Love you, too.

87
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,010
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

88
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,210
好了  什么口信
All right, what's the message?

89
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,450
因为如果又是一幅关于我胸部
'Cause if it's another hypothetical

90
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,050
虚构却出奇地精确的绘图
yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...

91
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,320
对了  那个我也带来了
Yeah, I have that, too.

92
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,860
该死
Damn it.

93
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,890
好了  口信是这样的
All right, here's the message.

94
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,460
各位好啊  没看到你们在这儿
"Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there.

95
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,100
我忙于沉浸在自己良好的感觉中
"I was too busy feelin' fine and..."

96
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,470
真的吗
Really?

97
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,970
沉浸于良好的感觉中  而且风流快活
"Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine."

98
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,840
你们可能注意到我面前
"You may have noticed the giant plate

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
这一大盘鸡翅了
"of hot wings in front of me.

100
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,750
我知道你们有多爱吃鸡翅
"I know how much you love hot wings.

101
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,450
不过有人刚贿赂了厨房
"Too bad someone bribed the kitchen

102
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,380
让他们今晚把这道菜取消
"to take them off the menu tonight.

103
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,680
所以  想吃鸡翅
"So, if you want some,

104
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,050
就得重回巨人银行的怀抱
"you're going to have to come back to GNB.

105
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,490
但是要抓紧  这提议
"But hurry, this offer

106
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,960
转瞬即逝
"will be gone lickety-split."

107
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,000
邪恶地大笑
"Do evil laugh."

108
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,340
你们这群混蛋最近忙啥呢
So, what are you turds up to?

109
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,340
我们两天后要去参加地标保护委员会的会议
Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days.

110
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,980
我的演讲已经准备好了
I have my whole presentation worked out.

111
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,380
我只需想一个好的押韵结尾
I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.

112
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,480
为什么非要押韵
Why does it need to rhyme?

113
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,750
如果论辩以押韵结尾
Mm. If you end an argument with a rhyme,

114
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,150
-说服力持久有效  -没错
- it's convincing <i>all</i> the time. - Yeah.

115
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,690
所以我们家的口号是
It's why in our apartment:

116
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,660
想要自己加分多多
If you're a-hopin' to score,

117
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,560
袜子不能随便丢丢
don't leave your socks on the floor.

118
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,390
-她从此没乱丢过  -对
- And she hasn't since. - No.

119
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,400
好吧  好吧  说几件事
Okay, okay. A couple of things.

120
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,030
-莉莉  我画得怎么样  -绝了
- Lily, how'd I do? - Nailed it.

121
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,370
其次  泰德
Secondly, Ted,

122
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,330
我很抱歉我对苏伊说了过分的话
I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey.

123
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,000
你真的打算将这个工程弃之不顾
Are you really going to walk away from this project

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,200
就因为生我的气吗
just because you're mad at me?

125
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,240
这不是因为我生你的气
It's not because I'm mad at you.

126
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,510
巴尼  阿卡迪亚是一个叫做
Barney, The Arcadian was designed

127
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,040
约翰・克里福德・拉拉比的人设计的
by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee.

128
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,010
即使他已经去世半个世纪了
And even though he's been dead for half a century,

129
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,380
但我有责任  对设计先辈的责任感
it's my duty, architect to architect,

130
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,480
让他的作品长存于世
to keep his work alive.

131
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,390
告诉我你多少能理解一点吧
Please tell me a little part of you understands.

132
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,590
我理解
I understand.

133
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,060
-苏伊有魔力私处  -什么
- Zoey has magic lady bits. - What?

134
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,190
苏伊的私处
Zoey's lady bits...

135
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,030
有魔力  因此她能控制你的意识
are magic, and that's how she controls your mind.

136
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,570
肮几十万年
You see, every few hundred millennia,

137
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,370
女人的私处就有质的飞跃...
lady bits leap forward...

138
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,900
我知道你才刚开头
I know you're only just getting started,

139
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,770
可已经很恶心了
but this is already gross.

140
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,510
我曾遇到一个女孩
I once knew such a girl.

141
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,880
正是在这间酒吧
It was last call.

142
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,180
当时快打烊了
In this very bar.

143
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,550
我擦咧
What...?!

144
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,220
坑爹啊
No...

145
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,960
我擦咧
What?!

146
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,120
你妹啊
No...

147
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,690
我擦咧闹不住妞
What?!

148
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,030
谢谢你没提那个女孩的名字
Thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.

149
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,110
巴尼  这事关乎大楼存亡
Barney, this is about the building.

150
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,310
别装了  明显是你被女色所迷
Come on. This is so about the girl.

151
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,780
好吧  我承认  是因为女人
Okay, fine. It's about the girl!

152
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,880
我之所以这么做是因为苏伊
I am doing this for Zoey!

153
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,210
我爱上她了
I'm in love with her.

154
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,650
我知道现在还为时过早  但很有可能
Look, I know it's early, but there's a very good chance

155
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,650
苏伊会是孕育我孩子的母亲
Zoey might be the mother of my children.

156
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,450
所以除了为捍卫约翰・克里福德・拉拉比的杰作
So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee,

157
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,490
我这么做还为了卢克和莱亚
I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.

158
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,390
等等  孩子取名卢克和莱亚  她会同意吗
Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?

159
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,360
如果我不推倒她最爱的大楼  就有可能
Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't.

160
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,760
巴尼  很抱歉
Barney, I'm sorry.

161
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,170
你现在才不感到抱歉呢  泰德・莫斯比
Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby.

162
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,930
可你以后会的
But you will be.

163
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,040
你会  后悔  不已
You... will... be.

164
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,610
那才是邪恶之笑的正版
That's how you do an evil laugh.

165
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,380
暂别啦
Ciao for now.

166
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,520
孩子们  你们还记得亚瑟・赫伯斯吗
Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs,

167
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,890
他是巴尼和马修在巨人银行的老上司
Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB?

168
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,260
亚瑟那时正在办离婚
Well, Arthur was going through a divorce

169
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,520
-正值伤心时期  -你好  亚瑟
- and taking it kind of hard. - Hi, Arthur.

170
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,030
一切顺利吧
Everything okay?

171
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,760
不  事事不顺
No, everything's not okay.

172
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,200
我那蠢妻子获得了小拖船的抚养权
My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat.

173
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
老天爷  我真该把她藏在
God, I should have kept her hidden

174
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
地下室的笼子里
in a cage in the basement.

175
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,540
那是不是虐畜罪吗
Isn't that animal cruelty?

176
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,440
我说的是藏我的妻子
I'm talking about my wife.

177
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,870
那没问题
Oh. That's fine, then.

178
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,410
是这样的  你认识那个叫泰德的设计师吧
So listen, you know Ted, the architect?

179
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:19,510
对  我认识你的朋友泰德
Yeah,I know your friend Ted.

180
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,620
那如果泰德在明天的重要会议上发言
So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow

181
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,150
说他认为阿卡迪亚酒店应该成为地标建筑
and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark...

182
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,890
你不会就炒他鱿鱼  对吧
you wouldn't just fire him, would you?

183
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,320
对吗
Right?

184
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,690
你不会就
You wouldn't just...

185
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:33,830
你不会的  对吧
You wouldn't just... yeah...

186
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,300
不  巴尼  我不会光炒他鱿鱼
No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him.

187
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,500
我还要炒了你
I'd also fire you.

188
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,700
我去买块大软糖  咱们再谈过
Come again for Big Fudge?

189
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,870
你能相信吗
Can you believe that?!

190
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,770
我不能被解雇  罗宾
I can't be unemployed, Robin!

191
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,380
我的工作是我身份的象征  是我存在的意义
My job is my identity; It's who I am.

192
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,380
它让我有信心去说服女孩子们
It gives me the confidence I need

193
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,780
我是个战斗机飞行员
to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.

194
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,650
我不明白
I-I don't understand.

195
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,450
他为什么要连你一起炒
Why would he fire you?

196
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,750
我不明白
I don't understand.

197
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,990
你为什么要连我一起炒
Why would you fire me?

198
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,320
你还记得莫斯比是如何得到那份工作的吗
Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?

199
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,360
因为他是我们能找到的最好的设计师
By being the best architect available?

200
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,000
错
No.

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,960
因为他是拉丁裔
By... being Latino?

202
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,100
错  我来帮你场景重现
No. Let me refresh your memory.

203
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,970
你当时就在这间房间
We were in this very room.

204
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,010
伙计们  告诉你们
Guys, I'm telling you,

205
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,180
如果泰德・莫斯比不令人称好  就解雇我吧
if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.

206
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,910
该死
Damn it!

207
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,310
我开玩笑的吧
I was kidding?

208
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,650
我没开玩笑
I'm not kidding!

209
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,580
对了  亚瑟
Oh, by the way, Arthur,

210
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,950
你和你妻子关系怎么样
uh, how are things with you and your wife?

211
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,120
非常好
Really good.

212
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,150
实际上  我把我名下所有资产都转到了她名下
In fact, I just put all my assets in her name.

213
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,090
这是我迄今为止最明智的举措
Smartest thing I've ever done.

214
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,190
该死
Damn it!

215
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,430
不行  你得保证莫斯比明天别出岔子
No,you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow.

216
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,400
因为要么那栋大楼玩完
Because either that building is going down,

217
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,230
要么你玩完
or you're going down.

218
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,130
他们要解雇他吗  太过分了
They're going to fire him? That sucks.

219
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,600
他爱那份工作
He loves that job.

220
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,100
他都干了好多年了
And he's been doing it for years.

221
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,240
好吧  巴尼在巨人银行具体做什么工作
Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?

222
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,510
-不清楚  -他有好多房间的钥匙
- No idea. - He has a lot of keys.

223
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,610
好吧  泰德  你能不能先考虑下
Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...

224
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,780
没什么好考虑的
There's nothing to think about.

225
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,150
我不能失去苏伊
I-I can't lose Zoey.

226
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,910
我现在只在乎这点
That's the only thing that matters to me right now.

227
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,280
好  泰德
Okay, Ted...

228
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,620
你知道我很喜欢苏伊
you know I love Zoey.

229
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,250
可有时候
But, look, sometimes...

230
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,690
当我去公园下棋时
I go play chess in the park.

231
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,660
下棋的要领...
And the key to chess...

232
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,190
好吧  我在网上下的
Okay, I play online.

233
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,160
下棋的要领是
But the key to chess...

234
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,160
好吧  我玩的是"愤怒的小鸟"
Okay, it's Angry Birds!

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,500
可玩"愤怒的小鸟"的要领在于
But the key to Angry Birds

236
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,870
总要预见到每一种可能的结果
is to always try to see every possible outcome.

237
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,540
要用石头或别的去砸那些猪
And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something.

238
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,410
我不知道  没玩过
I don't know; I don't play.

239
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,810
我下载不了
I can't get it to download.

240
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,110
重点是  你和苏伊的爱情
The point is, this thing with you and Zoey?

241
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,850
我可以预见三种可能性
I can see it going three possible ways.

242
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,510
脚本一
There's the first scenario.

243
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,080
委员会会长问你
The chairman asks you...

244
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
你认为阿卡迪亚该成为地标建筑吗
Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?

245
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,490
-于是你回答  -不该
- You say...- No.

246
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,050
然后苏伊当场跟你说分手
And Zoey dumps you on the spot.

247
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,160
我们分道扬镳
We're done here.

248
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,360
脚本二
There's the second scenario.

249
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,930
委员会会长问你
The chairman asks you...

250
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,760
你认为阿卡迪亚该成为地标建筑吗
Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?

251
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,460
-于是你回答  -该
- You say... - Yes.

252
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
然后你高兴了  大概一秒钟
And you're happy for, like, a second,

253
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,530
随即你意识到  你帮忙拯救的这栋大楼
until you realize the building you helped save

254
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,870
变成了一块纪念碑
has just become a monument

255
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,270
纪念这个女人害你所放弃的一切
to everything this woman made you give up,

256
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,540
然后你因此而恨她
and you resent her for it,

257
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,570
以至于到头来  你变成了那个说分手的人
<i>so much so, in fact,</i> <i>that</i> you <i>dump</i> her.

258
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,810
我们恩断义绝
We're done here.

259
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,810
-你说还有脚本三  -没错
- You said there was a third scenario. - Right.

260
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:06,250
委员会会长问你
<i>The chairman asks you...</i>

261
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,680
你认为阿卡迪亚该成为地标建筑吗
Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?

262
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,780
就在你作答之前
<i>But before you can answer...</i>

263
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,120
你被忍者扔出的飞镖击中脖子
<i>You're hit in the neck with</i> <i>a blow dart fired by the ninja</i>

264
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,660
那是苏伊前夫派来暗杀你的
<i>Zoey's ex-husband hired</i> <i>to assassinate you.</i>

265
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,030
我们到此为止

266
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,090
这个情况可能性比较小
That one's less likely.

267
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,830
我想说的是
What I'm saying...

268
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:26,130
我最不想说的话
what I hate saying...

269
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,640
听好了
is this.

270
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,600
你和苏伊迟早都要分手
You and Zoey are gonna break up.

271
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,340
但你仍旧可以挽回你和巴尼的事业
But you can still save your career and Barney's.

272
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,710
听我说  首先
Okay, first of all,

273
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,510
没有忍者能偷袭到我
no ninja's getting a jump on me.

274
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,880
我的反应能力有如丛林[jungle hunter 丛林猎人]
I have the reflexes of a jungle...

275
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,350
呆木
Tree?

276
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,850
其次
Second of all,

277
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,950
我不在乎我们会不会成功地走到一起
I don't care that the odds are stacked against us.

278
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,120
我宁愿试着和苏伊一起努力
I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey

279
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,090
也不愿意我的余生独自一人
than spend the rest of my life alone

280
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,690
靠玩"愤怒的小鸟"过日  话说这个游戏
playing Angry Birds, which, by the way,

281
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,260
我已经教你下载了不下20遍了
I've shown you how to download,like, 20 times.

282
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,660
我不得不说  泰德说得对
I've got to say,I'm with Ted on this.

283
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,900
-感谢支持  -我承认
- Thank you. - I mean, yes,

284
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,540
他们之间有一个巨大的分歧
this is a huge, divisive issue for them.

285
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,470
这意味着  不管结果如何
Which means no matter what happens,

286
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,710
你们都会十分憎恨对方
there's gonna be a lot of resentment.

287
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,510
这种憎恨可能持续数年
Probably lasting for years...

288
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,710
无时无刻影响着
infecting every single moment

289
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,910
你们今后的关系
of the rest of their relationship.

290
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,780
因此  综上所述  还是罗宾说得对
So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.

291
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,050
感谢支持
Thank you.

292
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:21,350
<i>当晚  在我熟睡之际</i>
<i>That night,as I slept soundly...</i>

293
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,360
巴尼  你在干嘛
Barney, what are you doing?

294
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,530
巴尼是谁
Who is this Barney?

295
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,840
我是约翰・克里福德・拉拉比
My name is John Clifford Larrabee,

296
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,870
阿卡迪亚酒店的设计师
architect of The Arcadian.

297
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,810
我来到你的梦中拜访你
And I am visiting you in a dream...

298
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,710
真的假的  感觉更像是
Really? 'Cause it feels more like

299
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,810
我那位租了件戏服
my insane friend renting a costume

300
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,380
就半夜闯进我公寓的疯子朋友
and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night

301
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,150
这已经不是他第一次干这种事了
for what I wish I could say was the first time.

302
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,650
这就是个梦
Look, it's a dream, it is.

303
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,860
别那么较真  行吗
So just... okay?

304
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,330
西奥多
Theodore...

305
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,060
记住我的话
heed my words:

306
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,660
不要试图挽救阿卡迪亚
do not try to save The Arcadian.

307
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,970
巴尼  抽屉里有套套
Barney, there's condoms in the drawer.

308
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,430
拿了赶紧走人
Just take them and get out.

309
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,770
都说了我不是巴尼
I am not Barney...

310
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,740
哇  光线变色了
Whoa! Lighting change!

311
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,440
西奥多  阿卡迪亚酒店是座失败的建筑
Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built,

312
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,350
在建筑史上毫无价值的老鼠窝
architecturally unimportant rat's nest

313
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,050
由一个值得竖起双拇指称赞的
designed by an overpaid,

314
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,820
薪酬过高  会抄袭的酒鬼设计的
plagiarizing ether addict with two thumbs.

315
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,790
正是在下
This guy.

316
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,220
好吧  我承认  它是个糟糕的建筑
Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building,

317
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,360
但就因为这个  我们就必须把它拆了吗
but... does that mean we have to knock it down?

318
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,530
我是说  它并没有影响任何人
I mean, it's not bothering anyone.

319
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,800
除了住在里面的人
Just anyone who lives in it.

320
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,700
或是看见它的人
Or looks at it.

321
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,370
又或是闻到它的人
Or smells it.

322
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,870
纽约的变化永不止步  西奥多
New York is never finished, Theodore.

323
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,340
她是位女士
She's a lady

324
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,380
只有为数不多的建筑师有机会与她共舞
only a handful of architects ever get to dance with.

325
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,240
别错过你的机会
Do not miss your turn.

326
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,650
阿卡迪亚必须得拆  是吗
The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?

327
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,850
没错
Indeed.

328
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,390
你知道这等于把我的私人生活给毁了吧
You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.

329
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,890
房子越多  问题越多
Mo' buildings, mo' problems.

330
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,890
仿Notorious BIG单曲Mo' Money Mo' Problems

331
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,900
这是个梦  对吧
This is a dream, right?

332
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,530
巴尼  我发誓如果是你
Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...

333
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,670
妈咪有魔力私物哦  泰德
Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted.

334
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,340
是梦  是梦
Dream! Dream!

335
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,110
那只是个梦
It was just a dream.

336
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,330
我知道有点晚
Hey. I know it's late, but, uh...

337
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,600
你想见面吗
you want to meet up?

338
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,870
你好  狮子先生
Hello, Mr. Lion.

339
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,510
功业盖物
"Look on my works,

340
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,210
强者折服
ye mighty, and despair"

341
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,210
出自雪莱的十四行诗《Ozymandias》1818

342
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,350
我就在这里
Hey, I met you right...

343
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,020
遇见你
...here.

344
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,720
是的  我就在这里
Right. And I mistook you

345
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,060
把你误认为妓女
for a prostitute right here.

346
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,430
如你所知  我姿色还在
As far as you know, I still could be one.

347
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,160
而你呢
Ah. And you,

348
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,060
我的好好先生  你已经欠了我一屁股债了哦
my good man, have run up quite a tab.

349
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,670
物有所值
Worth every penny.

350
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,110
好了
All right...

351
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,570
今天很开心
this was fun.

352
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,150
我要坐车回去了
I'm gonna take this cab.

353
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,850
明天是个大日子
Big day tomorrow.

354
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,820
我们得好好睡一觉
We need to get some sleep.

355
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,590
或者
And yet...

356
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,360
不了  睡觉吧
No, we should get some sleep.

357
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,490
但今晚很开心
But this was fun.

358
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,860
是啊
Yeah.

359
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,100
抬头看最后一眼  提醒我们
It's nice getting one last look

360
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,730
记住我们努力拯救的是什么  感觉真好
to remember what we're trying to save.

361
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:56,070
没错
Exactly.

362
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,100
你还好吗
You okay?

363
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,970
我很好  晚安
Yeah. Good night.

364
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,740
莫斯比先生  我将问你最后一遍
<i>Mr. Mosby, I'm going</i> <i>to ask you one last time.</i>

365
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,350
阿卡迪亚该成为地标建筑吗
<i>Should The Arcadian</i> <i>be a landmark?</i>

366
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,820
不  它不该成为地标建筑
No, it shouldn't be a landmark.

367
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,490
纽约有许多重要的建筑
There are a lot of important buildings in New York.

368
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,290
阿卡迪亚并不在此之列
The Arcadian isn't one of them.

369
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,100
抱歉打断一下
E-Excuse me,

370
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,730
我有个问题想问莫斯比先生
I have a question for Mr. Mosby.

371
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,130
如果他不认为
If he doesn't think

372
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,040
阿卡迪亚值得拯救  那这声音是谁的
The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this?

373
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,640
阿卡迪亚值得成为一个地标建筑
The Arcadian should be a landmark.

374
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,070
真的
It should.

375
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,110
它的狮子头是如此的有象征性
The lion head stonework is iconic.

376
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,350
我恨死了为巨人银行工作
I hate working for GNB.

377
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,580
他们是一群
They're a bunch of...

378
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,180
用生殖器思考的人
wieners and gonads.

379
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,620
我的老天爷
Oh, heavens!

380
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,320
我的上帝
My stars!

381
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,220
那是你的声音吗  莫斯比先生
Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?

382
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,230
对  是我
Yeah, that's me.

383
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,370
这简直是一场恶梦
This is a nightmare.

384
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,410
真不敢相信她还留着那段录音
I can't believe she kept that tape.

385
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,040
地标保护委员会明天将会做出最终决定
The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow,

386
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,310
基于今天的表现
and based on today...

387
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,110
他们肯定会把那个该死的地方定为地标建筑
They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.

388
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,420
是啊  我们马上就要变成无业游民
Yeah. We'll end up out of a job,

389
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,450
这全都归功于某个傻里傻气
all thanks to some stupid,

390
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,050
却有点威武的狮子头
only sort of awesome lion head.

391
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,820
你最好快点习惯那个狮子头
Better get used to that lion head.

392
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:19,760
从明天开始  它将永远在那屹立不倒
As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times.

393
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,800
这全都归功于我那美妙又讨喜的押韵
And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.

394
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,370
我们该怎么办
What are we gonna do?

395
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,940
-我们应该买家酒吧  -我们真应该买家酒吧
- We should buy a bar. - We should totally buy a bar!

396
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,610
我们绝对应该买家酒吧
We should absolutely totally buy a bar!

397
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,270
这是目前唯一明智的主意了
It's really the only sensible idea right now.

398
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,580
准备好听我的想法了吗
Oh, oh, and ready?

399
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,940
这是主题酒吧
It's a theme bar.

400
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,010
把它布置成法庭
It's a courtroom.

401
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,080
-不错  -对
- Yes! - Ah!

402
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,550
酒吧的服务员要穿着性感的法官袍
Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.

403
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,890
准了
I'll allow it!

404
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,690
这是唯一一个你一出现  就会获刑的法庭
The only court where you show up, <i>then</i> get served.

405
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,320
赞
Ho!

406
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,460
评判工作交给啤酒陪审团来完成
You're judged by a jury of your beers.

407
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,390
这主意不错
That's not bad.

408
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,390
你们都给我闭嘴
Just stop it!

409
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,560
没人要买酒吧
No one's buying a bar.

410
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,200
我们现在遇到了一点小难题
Right now we have a little problem.

411
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,960
要齐心协力想出解决的办法
Let's just think of a solution.

412
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,230
莉莉  结束了
Lily, it's over.

413
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,900
好人一败涂地
The good guys lost.

414
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,270
这可说不准  死党会为朋友插敌人两刀
I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical.

415
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,640
如果真有一个计划能让咱们脱离困境
If there is a plan that'll get us out of this,

416
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,740
肯定藏在这小脑袋里[butter churn亦有女性阴部之意]
it's somewhere inside this butter churn.

417
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,880
她会想出来的
She'll think of it.

418
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,680
我准备坐在这儿
I'm just gonna sit here...

419
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,650
等着灵光一闪那刻的降临
and watch it happen.

420
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,420
她想出来了
And she's got it!

421
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,020
莉莉  计划是什么
Lily, what's the plan?

422
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,660
最好是个好计划
Oh, this ought to be good.

423
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,790
于是莉莉告诉了我们她的计划
And then Lily told us her plan.

424
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,830
哇  真是好到不行不行的
Oh, this is <i>good!</i>

425
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,230
我们得马上去找亚瑟
We have to find Arthur right now.

426
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,800
这有这么难吗
What is so difficult about this?!

427
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,010
小拖船不到五分钟就做到了
Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes.

428
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,240
你果然是个次等货
This is bush league!

429
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,510
亚瑟  你好
Hey, Arthur!

430
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,510
小狗真可爱
Oh, cute dog!

431
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,350
不  我另一只狗小拖船才叫可爱
No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog.

432
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,820
这个让人失望的小玩意  就是一便宜的仿货
This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile.

433
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,090
我实话实说
I said it!

434
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,720
我的爱是给那种
Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs

435
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,560
能听命令上厕所的狗
that go to the bathroom on command

436
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,590
而不是浪费我时间的狗
instead of wasting my time!

437
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,930
亚瑟  马修的妻子想到一个主意
Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea

438
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,230
能让我们扭转大势  达到拆毁阿卡迪亚的目的
for how we can save <i>not saving</i> The Arcadian.

439
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,300
哦  他的妻子想到个主意
Oh, his wife has an idea.

440
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,670
让我告诉你何为妻子
Let me tell you about wives, okay?

441
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,100
她们不但离开你  还把你最好的朋友给带走了
They leave you and take your best friend with them.

442
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,340
这货不是小拖船
You're not Tugboat!

443
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,910
这货永远也成不了小拖船
You'll never be Tugboat!

444
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,380
亚瑟
Hey, Arthur?

445
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,590
我猜这狗也算可爱的一种吧
I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever.

446
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,530
那你的主意是什么
So... so what's the idea?

447
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,500
好的  先听完我的要求
Okay, first hear my demands.

448
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,300
一  不许辞掉泰德和巴尼
One,Ted and Barney keep their jobs.

449
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,100
二  当你们最后真能炸毁阿卡迪亚时
Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian,

450
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
要让他们俩其中一个按下那个按钮
one of them gets to push the button.

451
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,710
-我来  -我来
- Dibs. - Dibs.

452
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,940
好吧  到底是什么主意
Fine! What's the idea?

453
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,080
-这个嘛  -<i>孩子们  因为法律原因</i>
- Well... - <i>Kids, for legal reasons,</i>

454
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,810
<i>我必须省略这部分故事</i>
<i>I have to skip</i> <i>this part of the story</i>

455
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,550
<i>直接跳到第二天晚上</i>
<i>and jump ahead</i> <i>to the next night,</i>

456
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,050
<i>地标保护委员会</i>
<i>as the Landmarks</i> <i>Preservation Commission</i>

457
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,280
<i>做出最后裁定</i>
<i>gave their verdict.</i>

458
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,650
昨晚  全体委员进行了一次投票
Last night, this committee took a vote,

459
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,290
虽然我们最初都觉得
and while we have all felt from the very beginning that

460
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,660
阿卡迪亚酒店是
The Arcadian is,

461
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,290
一座难看的建筑
well, an eyesore...

462
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,500
在关于狮子头的石雕像方面
Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony

463
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,600
莫斯比先生却给出了出人意料的证词
<i>about the lion's head</i> <i>stonework</i>

464
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
这让我们别无选择  只好宣判它是
<i>left us no choice</i> <i>but to declare it...</i>

465
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,940
一座地标建筑
a landmark.

466
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,310
然而昨晚发生了件有趣的事
But then, something else happened last night.

467
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,550
就是那个狮子头石雕像
<i>That same lion's head</i> stonework...

468
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,420
消失了
...disappeared.

469
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,690
所以  这让我们的工作变得简单了
So...that makes our job a little easier.

470
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,390
动议否决
Motion denied.

471
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,000
苏伊
Zoey...

472
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,200
苏伊
Zoey!

473
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,010
好吧  你还有什么好说的
All right, what do you have to say for yourself?

474
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,980
我不知道
I don't know.

475
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,410
可能有时  为了给更好的事物让路
Sometimes... things have to fall apart

476
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,620
有些事物不得不破碎
to make way for better things.

477
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:15,260
我们曲终人散
We're done here.

478
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,090
好了  你不必再隐藏了
Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore.

479
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,190
你现在可以告诉我  你对苏伊的真实想法
You may now say what you really think of Zoey.

480
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,560
我也不知道  关于那个狮子头或许她说得对
I don't know, she may have been right about the lion's head.

481
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,630
它让阿卡迪亚有一种帝王范的优雅
It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance.

482
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,360
重申一次  它跟我的羽绒被真的很搭
Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet.

483
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,100
希望我没用错螺丝刀[掉下来就完蛋了]
I hope I used the right screws.
