(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,011
Professor Gerard,
I came to ask for a favor.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,521
- The answer is no.
- Which is why I brought this.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,120
- You know.
- And you talk a big game,

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,129
but you're just as human
as everyone else,

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,441
you smug son of a bitch.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,248
- Louis. What are you doing here?
- Leaving.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,330
That way, I don't have to
look at either one of you two liars.

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,881
(DOOR SLAMS)

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,442
- Oh, my God, he knows.
- He doesn't just know.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,081
He's a name partner.

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,726
She came to me and lied to my face.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,769
She did it to protect me.

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,009
I'm going to keep hammering on her
until you break.

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,963
With a new name
comes a new beginning.

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,050
Here's to our newest
name partner, Louis Litt.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,645
Louis has something on you.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,369
Daniel Hardman embezzled money
from the firm and I covered it up.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,569
Why couldn't you
trust me with this before?

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,569
Because I didn't know
how you'd react.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,206
Jessica,
your secret is safe with me.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,529
I thought we were done
with rooftop conversations.

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,251
- Some things require privacy.
- I haven't heard you say that

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,840
since the midnight coup
of Schmidt, Gordon, and Van Dyke.

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,803
- Are you done?
- It wasn't a joke.

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,922
Neither is this. I told Jeff Malone

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,042
I helped cover up
Daniel Hardman's embezzlement.

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,482
Why the hell would you
open that time capsule?

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,921
Because he knew the explanation
we gave the partners about Louis

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,008
was bullshit and I had
to tell him something.

31
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,401
You could have told him
it was none of his business.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,205
Harvey, I didn't bring you here
to get relationship advice.

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,164
I brought you here to tell you what I did
in case it ever came up.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,645
No, you didn't.
You brought me here

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,330
because now you have
to get Louis to back you,

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,808
and you knew you'd be mad at me when I
told you what you didn't want to hear.

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,081
You're right.
I don't want to hear it.

38
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,044
How do you think it's going to go
when I tell Louis he holds the fate

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,925
- of my relationship in his hands?
- How do you think it's going to go

40
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,168
the first time Malone
brings up Louis' blackmail?

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,328
- I don't care.
- Well, I'll tell you how it's going to go.

42
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,370
Louis is going to look back
with his beady little eyes and say,

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,683
"Embezzlement? That's not
how I got my name on the wall."

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,723
And the shit's going
to hit the fan anyway.

45
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,286
You know what?
You can be a real son of a bitch.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,449
Yeah. But instead of being pissed at me,
why don't you take a look in the mirror?

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,210
Because we held out an olive branch.

48
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,369
And after Louis hears this,
he's going to take that branch

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,005
and beat the shit out of us with it.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,846
Louis.

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,328
Professor Gerard?
What are you doing here?

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,886
I've got a small
legal matter to attend to.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,809
Well, is it anything
I can help you with?

54
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,570
Actually, I'm here
to speak with Harvey.

55
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,570
Ah. Ah. I understand.
You're looking for a name partner.

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,081
Well, you can't quite see it from here,
but if you walk back about 10 feet,

57
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,770
take a gander to your left,
you'll see I've gotten a little

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,006
- recognition.
- I appreciate that.

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,771
But as I said,
I'm here to speak with Harvey.

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,289
MIKE: So are we going to talk
about that little welcome speech

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,765
that Jessica made for Louis?

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,770
We don't have to talk about it,
because Louis isn't going to accept it.

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,961
Why not?

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,730
Because it will be
a cold day in hell

65
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,569
when he can accept
being Maverick to my Iceman.

66
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,842
Don't... Don't you mean Iceman
to your Maverick?

67
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,450
No, I don't.

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,961
You actually
want to be Iceman over Maverick?

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,764
- Who got the trophy?
- Who's the better pilot?

70
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,927
- The one who got the trophy.
- Wrong.

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,520
Because in the end,
Maverick saved Iceman.

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,091
And if he hadn't,
Trophy Boy would be sitting

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,770
on the bottom of the Indian Ocean
right now.

74
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,803
- Where he'd still be the man.
- According to you.

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,287
According to me
is the only according to that matters.

76
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,805
- There we go.
- Maybe.

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,482
But according to me,
Viper was the real hero of that film.

78
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,807
What, you think
I'm too old to know Top Gun?

79
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,400
What I think is, you have no business
being in my office.

80
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,648
Are we going to do this
in front of your associate?

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,524
We don't have to do anything
in front of anybody.

82
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,880
You just have to go.

83
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,041
Harvey.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,166
I need a lawyer.

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,930
Louis' office is down the hall.

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,611
I don't want Louis.
I want you.

87
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,091
That's funny.
The last time you saw me,

88
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,680
you told me I wasn't fit to practice law
in your ivory tower.

89
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,282
What I told you was,
is that you'll sacrifice ethics for wins.

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,007
And right now, I'm not in my ivory tower
and I need a win.

91
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,049
I knew it. You're just like everybody else.

92
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,925
The ends don't justify the means
until it's your ass on the line.

93
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,008
Do you think I like
asking you for help?

94
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,691
I think this Liberty Rail
thing must have you by the balls.

95
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,326
- So you know.
- I know after their train derailed,

96
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,205
you were appointed to <i>assess</i>
the victims' compensation formula.

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,209
And I know after you did,
some of those victims

98
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,402
hired a lawyer
and opened an investigation.

99
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,851
Then you also know they found nothing.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,002
Then the question is, why are you here?

101
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,124
The TSA found $25,000 in my luggage

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,641
the day I announced
I was changing the formula.

103
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,322
So now you're being accused
of accepting a bribe.

104
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,965
Which I did not do.

105
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,889
Well, good luck proving that, Professor,

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,002
because it won't be with my help.

107
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,646
I was wrong about you, Mr. Specter.

108
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,524
I never thought
that you wouldn't represent somebody

109
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,766
just because didn't like them.

110
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,769
Well, you're wrong again.
I don't like you.

111
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,850
But I'm not representing you,
because you did something shady,

112
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,406
and I'm not screwing over
crash victims for the likes of you.

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,760
You know I didn't do this.

114
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,009
What I know is you showed yourself in,
you can show yourself out.

115
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,008
(SINGING) See the money,
wanna stay for your meal

116
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,010
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

117
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,727
Everybody want to know
how it feel

118
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,208
Everybody want to see
what it's like

119
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,085
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

120
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,761
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

121
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,644
All right!

122
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,129
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

123
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,044
The greenback boogie

124
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,769
Okay, I didn't want to
say it in front of Gerard,

125
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,530
but has it occurred to
you that you're an idiot

126
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,165
if you don't take this case?

127
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,045
Last year, you were shitting yourself he'd
find out about you.

128
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,764
And now you think we
should work with him?

129
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,083
No, I wasn't worried he'd find out.
I was worried about Louis.

130
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,204
Gerard didn't bat an eye at me
back then and he didn't just now.

131
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,685
But we get him out of this,

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
and he ever does find out about me,
he's going to owe us.

133
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,721
Mike, that man is never
going to compromise his ethics

134
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,569
just because we got him out of a jam.

135
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,001
Never going to compromise his ethics?
You just said he took a bribe.

136
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,645
So what does that have
to do with anything?

137
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,041
It has everything to do with everything,
because you don't think he did it.

138
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,286
(SCOFFS)

139
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,520
- So what?
- So what?

140
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,962
That means you're not turning him down
because you think he's shady.

141
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,761
You're turning him down
because you have

142
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,769
a Henry Gerard-sized
chip on your shoulder.

143
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,850
- I do not have a chip on my shoulder.
- You sure sound like you do.

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,241
Which makes you worse than an idiot,
it makes you a jackass.

145
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,850
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

146
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,361
You know that he divided that money
fairly, which means that you're...

147
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,086
I don't care what it means.
And I don't need a lecture from you.

148
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,361
Apparently, you do.

149
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,767
Because you're about to screw over
a bunch of innocent people

150
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,645
just to stick it to some guy
who hurt your feelings.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,731
And that's not something
I ever thought I'd be saying to you.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,561
Oh, look who it is.
The woman who put me in my place.

153
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,887
What now?
You want me to sign a piece of paper

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,445
admitting that I was the man
on the grassy knoll?

155
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,688
I meant what I said
at that ceremony, Louis.

156
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,531
You mean the ceremony
that you only had in order to trick me?

157
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,645
I had it because you demanded it.
But I'm not here to talk about that.

158
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,091
I'm here to talk about Jeff Malone.

159
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,407
- What about him?
- You may be aware that he and I are...

160
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,885
Fifty Shades of Grey?
I'm aware.

161
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,290
I'm going to let that go.

162
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,927
Because you may also not be aware
that I had to lie to him.

163
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,562
He doesn't know about Mike, does he?

164
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,843
No. But he does know
you committed a crime

165
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,167
and that you resigned
and now your name is up on the wall.

166
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,363
- What did you tell him?
- I told him you found out

167
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,562
that I covered up
Daniel Hardman's embezzlement

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,247
and that you used it to strong-ann me.

169
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,806
And now, you want me to protect
another one of your secrets.

170
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,763
It's the same secret, Louis.

171
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,008
And you have just
as much invested in it as I do.

172
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,687
No, I don't. Because I don't care if your
relationship with Jeff survives or not.

173
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,201
What do you want, Louis?

174
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,288
I want something
for continuing to cover your ass.

175
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,006
You got something.
You got your name on the wall.

176
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,043
Now I want the respect
that comes with it.

177
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,606
- Meaning?
- I want one of Harvey's clients.

178
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,882
Which one?

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,326
That's between me and Harvey.

180
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,487
(SINGING)
You wasted all your time

181
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,331
You didn't mean it

182
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,046
You stole what was mine

183
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,764
I didn't need it

184
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,485
Okay. I agreed to meet.

185
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,685
I hope it's not just so you can tell me
more about what a horrible person I am.

186
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,047
I came here to tell you
that I changed my mind.

187
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,447
So, you admitted to yourself
that I didn't do this?

188
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,528
I've admitted to myself
that you came to me

189
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,685
because this case needs rule-bending.
And you're going to tell me why.

190
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,806
Right now.

191
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,882
- The money.
- Yes, the money.

192
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,721
If you weren't bribed, where the hell
did you get that $25,000 from?

193
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,365
You know where it came from.

194
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,286
It's the same thing you tried to use
to blackmail me last year.

195
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,446
Let me get this straight.

196
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,766
You have an explanation for the money

197
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,325
that would get you out
of this whole thing.

198
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,805
But I can't use it.

199
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,330
- Where are you going?
- To get you out of this.

200
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,042
Welcome to the real world,
Professor.

201
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,360
I need you to find out everything you can
on Garrett Brady.

202
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,289
Absolutely.
Who's Garrett Brady?

203
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,004
The guy on the other side
of Gerard's suit.

204
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,201
Wait a second.
Does this mean you took his case?

205
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,284
You know that means I took his case,
and I don't want to hear any gloating.

206
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,767
Gloating? No. No, no, no.
I'm not... I'm not gloating.

207
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,689
I'm merely recognizing
the fact that you

208
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,009
completely changed your mind
based entirely on what I said.

209
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,730
- Which is gloating.
- Potato, po-tah-to.

210
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,604
But as long as you're going
to think of it that way,

211
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,644
I might as well point out
that since you listened to my lecture,

212
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,922
maybe you should start
calling me Professor.

213
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,769
I'm going to start
calling you unemployed

214
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,810
if you don't figure out
a way around using Gerard's alibi.

215
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,729
Wait. We can't say where
the money came from?

216
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,727
No, we can't.

217
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,808
Because he was playing
back room poker.

218
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,445
And if that comes out,
Harvard fires him.

219
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,803
Are you kidding me? He's an ethics
professor and he's breaking the law?

220
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,843
Where the hell do you
think my chip comes from?

221
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,527
Well, if we can't use his alibi,

222
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,801
how are we supposed
to get him out of this?

223
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,887
I don't know, Professor.

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,809
But you're the one
who wanted us to take this case,

225
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,605
so why don't you use that big brain
of yours and find a solution?

226
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,721
- You're giving me Henry Gerard.
- What?

227
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,411
I saw him, I want him,
you've got him, he's mine.

228
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,681
That's not how the way
it works, Louis.

229
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,290
I'm afraid you'll have
to find yourself another boyfriend.

230
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,562
Oh, this is exactly how it works.

231
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,527
You talked to Jessica, didn't you?

232
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,210
I sure did, and she used me
to cover her ass.

233
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,129
So, I get one of your clients
in return.

234
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,083
You want one of my clients,
we can talk about that.

235
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,725
But Gerard's staying with me.

236
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,764
Oh, please. Don't pretend
like you actually care about him.

237
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,847
He can't even stand you.

238
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,089
Louis, I just offered to consider
giving you one of my clients.

239
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,929
So I suggest you let Gerard go.

240
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,930
No, I'm not letting anything go,
because it doesn't make any sense.

241
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,566
Not only can't he stand you,
he doesn't respect you.

242
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,921
- Because he's got things...
- What did you just say to me?

243
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,726
I said he doesn't respect you.

244
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,889
Well, you know what?
He definitely doesn't respect you.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,287
Because when he told
me he needed a lawyer,

246
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,243
I tried to send him your way.

247
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,570
And his exact words were,
"I don't want Louis. I want you."

248
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,609
Fine. Then I'll just take another one
of your clients.

249
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,324
- You're not taking a thing.
- You just said that I...

250
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,363
I don't give a shit
what I just said, okay?

251
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,164
My clients are my clients.

252
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,681
And you don't get out of my office
in the next three seconds,

253
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,325
something is going to happen
between you and me.

254
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,842
And I guarantee it won't end with you
keeping all of your teeth.

255
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,165
No. Just turn around
and walk right back out that door.

256
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,526
- Harvey.
- Did you hear what I said?

257
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,051
I did. But apparently,
you didn't hear what Jessica said

258
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,645
about wiping the slate clean.

259
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,364
And apparently you
didn't hear what I said,

260
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,482
because I just told Louis
he could have one of my clients.

261
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,045
And three seconds later,
you told him he couldn't.

262
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,731
Yeah, because I realized
that I'm paying for Jessica's mistake.

263
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,729
No, Harvey. You were willing
to pay for her mistake

264
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,207
right up until Louis
said Gerard doesn't respect you.

265
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,210
- Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
- You can lie to yourself all you want,

266
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,891
- but I'm not going to let you bullshit me.
- What the hell are you talking about?

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,890
Henry Gerard is the one person you
respect who never respected you.

268
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,047
And Louis touched that nerve.

269
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,447
And I told you,
that has nothing to do with it.

270
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,887
- You really think that?
- I don't think it, I know it.

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,002
Then you know what, Harvey?
You're no different than Louis.

272
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,202
Because you have
a chance to help us all move on,

273
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,004
and you are blowing it off
out of pettiness,

274
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,531
which is exactly
what Louis would do.

275
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,881
- What do you want from me, Donna?
- I want you to be a grown-up

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,480
and do what you said you'd do
in the first place.

277
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,162
You got something?

278
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,850
Yeah, we've been
overlooking the obvious.

279
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,526
Yeah, I'm not in the mood
for 20 questions. Give it to me.

280
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,881
Unless you're traveling
internationally and don't report it,

281
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,968
carrying cash on board
a plane isn't a crime.

282
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,491
Great, except for the fact that

283
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,887
Gerard's not being charged
with smuggling, he's being sued.

284
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,731
Right. But my point is, how did
Garrett Brady even find that out?

285
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,889
He found out because
Gerard was detained by the TSA.

286
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,890
Who talked to him for five minutes
and then sent him on his way.

287
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,207
Those searches aren't
a matter of public record.

288
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,810
- Exactly.
- Holy shit.

289
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,046
Brady bribed the TSA.

290
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,050
Which isn't only illegal,
it makes that report totally inadmissible.

291
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,650
You figured this out on your own?

292
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,525
I would have done it faster,
but I had to order some sushi.

293
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,607
Would have done it faster.

294
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,370
That's what you said
your first week here.

295
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,926
- Except it was pizza instead of sushi.
- Yeah, I'm growing.

296
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,809
You mean Rachel
taught you how to eat.

297
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,524
Like I said, I'm growing.

298
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,163
Donna, I'm a little
busy at the moment.

299
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,370
Too busy to take on this?

300
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,481
What's that?

301
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,490
Just the first client that Jessica gave
Harvey when he made name partner.

302
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,449
Harvey said he wouldn't let me
have any of his clients.

303
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,931
No, he said he would.

304
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,964
But then, instead of taking him up on it,
you went ahead and shit on his feelings.

305
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,161
Please.
Harvey doesn't have feelings.

306
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,645
That's not true and you know it.

307
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,966
And you of all people
should know that a person

308
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,809
can overreact when they're hurt.

309
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,968
If you're referring to me,
I do not overreact when...

310
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,003
Okay. Whatever you say,
Fatty-Baldy.

311
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,690
Okay, get the hell
out of my office and...

312
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,002
Fine, you have a small
legitimate point.

313
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,925
- I really hurt his feelings?
- Yeah, you really did.

314
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,923
But then he realized
he was overreacting

315
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,651
and that this was a chance for us all
to get back to where we were.

316
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,205
You swear that is the first client

317
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,368
that Jessica gave him
after he made name partner?

318
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,721
I swear.

319
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,084
Leave me the file.

320
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,803
You two go ahead.
I haven't decided yet.

321
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,160
Actually, we're not here for the falafel.

322
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,806
We're here to introduce ourselves.
Mike Ross.

323
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,400
Harvey Specter.
We represent Henry Gerard.

324
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,649
Oh. (CHUCKLES) Well, in that case,
let me buy you two lunch.

325
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,127
Because I'm about to come
into an unexpected windfall.

326
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,288
Well, I guess that's your thing,
paying people off.

327
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,846
I hope the TSA
got more than some shitty falafel.

328
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
What the hell are you talking about?

329
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,771
I'm talking about this.

330
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,128
- Bribery?
- HARVEY: Ironic, isn't it?

331
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,005
You suing Professor Gerard
for accepting a bribe

332
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,202
when you're the one paying off
federal employees?

333
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,891
Allegedly paying, Counselor.
Tsk-tsk.

334
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,889
- You don't want to slander me.
- So you admit it?

335
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,967
I don't admit a thing.

336
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,889
Your client sold out
victims of a train derailment.

337
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,887
He's going to pay.

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,889
You may not be
willing to admit anything here,

339
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,286
but you'll have to
in front of the judge.

340
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,647
Because I've drafted subpoenas
for every TSA employee

341
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,003
- on duty that night.
- Drop the case, Mr. Brady.

342
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,007
- Are you threatening me?
- We're informing you.

343
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,125
Well, let me inform you.

344
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,369
In case you forgot, the TSA falls under
the Department of Homeland Security.

345
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,482
Which makes this a
national security issue.

346
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,967
This has nothing to do with national
security and you know it.

347
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,970
All I know is, the government found
a large sum of cash on a passenger.

348
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,003
How they came to know that,
how they proceeded to investigate that,

349
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,407
and what they did with that information
is the government's business.

350
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,205
- And that's what you're going with?
- That's not what I'm going with.

351
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,924
That's what they're going to go with.

352
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,611
So you can call up
as many TSA agents as you like,

353
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,324
but they're not going
to be saying a thing.

354
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,886
And you can buy
your own damn falafel.

355
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,241
(SNAPS FINGERS)
I need Cutie Pie Cosmetics.

356
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,802
You want to try that again?

357
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,809
I have a meeting with Joan Walsh tonight
and I need her files.

358
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,968
- Joan is Harvey's client.
- Not anymore.

359
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,007
Since when?

360
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,925
Since it doesn't matter,
because I'm name partner.

361
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,401
Which means when I say
I need something,

362
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,569
your response should either be
"How high?" or "Can I have another?"

363
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,522
Fine. There are a few things
that you should know...

364
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,210
You see, what I know is,

365
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,563
your boss seems to think
all it takes to impress Joan Walsh

366
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,927
is getting Donna to make
a fancy dinner reservation.

367
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,566
But I'm going to impress her
with so much legal domination

368
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,681
that by the end of the night,

369
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,167
all she's going to be able to say is,
"Harvey Specter who?"

370
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,931
- Okay, that's a mistake, and I...
- A mistake? Oh, I get it.

371
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,964
You're trying to impress me
with your legal domination

372
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,890
to prove that you're not just a paralegal,
but an associate.

373
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,967
No, Louis, I'm not...

374
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,605
See, I don't care
what you call yourself.

375
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,406
So unless you did such a shitty job
the files are un-readable,

376
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,124
hand them over to me right now.

377
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,724
That's more like it.

378
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,201
What's this?

379
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,766
I know you have to work tonight.
But you also need to eat.

380
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,530
I wouldn't call this just eating.

381
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,369
Well, you deserve
better than paper plates.

382
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,927
- I don't mind paper plates.
- Oh, I know you don't.

383
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,123
- I just said you deserve better.
- Is that ropa vieja?

384
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,882
Mmm-hmm. I made it myself.

385
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,683
Which means you got it
at the Cuban place

386
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,043
- that I love on 40th and Lex.
- By myself.

387
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,003
What did I do to deserve this?

388
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,090
I don't know.

389
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,483
I'm just... Feeling closer.

390
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,966
Because I confided in you.

391
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,687
Because the walls
are coming down and I can feel it.

392
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,648
What did I do to deserve you?

393
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,806
Mmm. Well, we can talk about that

394
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,527
over this delicious meal
that I made all by myself.

396
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,604

(mum-nus)

398
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,046
And then I said,
"Helen, that's no Pomeranian.

399
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,004
"That's a Pomimo.
You've been had."

400
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,203
(LAUGHS)
That is hilarious.

401
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,323
Really. Dogs. They are...
They are so fascinating.

402
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,727
- Do you have many dogs, Louis?
- Hell, no.

403
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,367
Building regulations,
it's a cluster...

404
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,605
I've been fighting them for years.

405
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,165
- Oh, that's horrible.
- Yes.

406
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,681
As is what's going on with your stock.

407
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,729
Oh, Louis, we're having dinner.
Put that away.

408
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,291
No, no. But I just thought you'll
be interested to know

409
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,367
that we could skyrocket
the share price...

410
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,211
Right now, what I'm interested in
is having another Manhattan

411
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,651
and hearing what's
on the dessert list.

412
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,330
We don't need a list.
Get the creme brfilée.

413
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,046
- Now, this stock issue? I have...
- Fax the papers to my office,

414
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,571
and I'll review them
when I get home.

415
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,330
When you get home? What the...

416
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,169
What the hell did we come
to dinner for then?

417
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,362
- For this.
- What this?

418
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,766
This.

419
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,926
Okay, I don't know how Harvey handled
these quarterly reviews, but...

420
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,203
Oh, Harvey was magnificent.

421
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,926
(SIGHS) Truth be told,
I was a little disappointed

422
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,969
when I heard that you'd be
handling this instead of him.

423
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,129
But I haven't seen your Cha-Cha yet,
so the jury's still out.

(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,050
- That was a lawyer joke.
- Yep, got it.

426
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,640
Yep. Listen. Joan.

427
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,043
I think you're going to be really glad

428
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,369
that it was me here tonight, because
I already sent a letter to your board.

429
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,245
- You did what?
- I notified them of this.

430
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,091
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

431
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,488
Why the hell would you do
something so patently stupid?

432
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,525
Stupid? Hey. I didn't become
name partner being stupid.

433
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,883
Didn't you? Two members of my board
are about to reach their term limits.

434
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,162
At least one of them is being circled
by Glamour Cosmetics.

435
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,760
You have just notified
that person of a product

436
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,769
that I've had in R 8; D for years.

437
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,446
And now, they can trade information

438
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,803
for a seat on the board
of my biggest competitor.

439
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,810
- Joan, I didn't know.
- Tell me, Mr. Litt.

440
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,810
Did you actually graduate
from law school

441
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,446
or did you just buy your
way onto the letterhead?

442
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,686
Yeah, you better put that bag down.
Because we're staying all night.

443
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,206
It didn't go well with Joan, did it?

444
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,924
No, it didn't,
because you sandbagged me.

445
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,087
I didn't sandbag you.

446
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,725
Well then, what do you call
not telling me

447
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,245
that Glamour was circling
her board members?

448
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,840
I tried to tell you, but you couldn't
hear me through all of your rage.

449
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,009
What I'm not hearing is the sound of you
putting your bag down.

450
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,929
Because the board members
are meeting tomorrow afternoon,

451
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,963
and I only have until then to fix this.

452
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,206
And you want me to help you?

453
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,810
You're the associate on this case,
aren't you?

454
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,001
So now I'm an associate?

455
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,724
Okay, you know what?
Now is not the time to get into it.

456
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,444
No, now is exactly
the time to get into it.

457
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,769
Because you have taken
every opportunity possible

458
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,484
to make me feel like I am nothing.

459
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,443
And now, even though
you want something,

460
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,130
you're still treating me
like I'm nothing.

461
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,805
I'm treating you like
every other associate.

462
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,127
That is bullshit. And you know,
even if it were true,

463
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,685
you didn't used
to treat me that way.

464
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,051
I didn't used to know
you lied to me on a daily basis.

465
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,723
Louis, it would serve you right

466
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,091
if I take my bag and leave you here
and go home to the man that I love.

467
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,965
- So you're not going to help?
- No, I'm going to help you.

468
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,844
But not because you deserve it.

469
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,122
I'll do it because I am an associate

470
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,562
and I am a professional,
which means I am capable

471
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,684
of putting the personal aside
in order to do my job.

472
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,850
- And one of those, please.
- Just what I was in the mood for.

473
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,962
Well, if you're getting a bagel,
that means you kicked ass.

474
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,570
Which I did.

475
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,170
You called up the TSA and busted up
their national security defense?

476
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,850
No, I used their defense.

477
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,402
Gerard's going to testify under seal
because it's a matter of national security.

478
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,521
And the judge bought that.

479
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,086
What's not to buy?
The TSA made the argument for us.

480
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,965
- What did Brady say?
- That's the best part about it.

481
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,165
He doesn't even know it.

482
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,843
- It's a matter of national security.
- We testify under seal,

483
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,361
the judge realizes that Gerard
is a degenerate gambler.

484
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,527
But a fair mediator.

485
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,529
The case gets dismissed,
and Garrett Brady

486
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,244
and Harvard Law
never know what happened.

487
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,964
You thought of all
of that on your own?

488
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,411
You think you're the only one

489
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,522
who can come up
with an intelligent solution?

490
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,120
You are 1 for 400 in the time
we've worked together.

491
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,408
Okay, smart guy,
since I did your job for you,

492
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,364
- you're going to do my job for me.
- You want me to prep Gerard

493
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,245
because you don't want to sit in a room
and listen to him talk for two hours.

494
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,886
I didn't want to 15 years ago,
and I don't want to now.

495
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,331
We only get one shot at this,
and his testimony better be rock solid.

496
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,566
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thanks.

497
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,603
Oh, yeah. Sure. Help yourself.

498
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,000
Dick.

499
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,130
I see you haven't slept.

500
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,765
I have a lot of work
that needs attending to.

501
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,601
I bet you do, considering the phone call
I got from Joan Walsh this morning.

502
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,131
Oh. She called you?

503
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,607
She wanted to know what the other
name partners were going to do

504
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,963
- about the one that screwed the pooch.
- Oh, come on. That is not fair.

505
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,206
I didn't have all of the information and...

506
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,290
You had enough information
to make a deal to get her from Harvey.

507
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,243
And part of that deal
was you backing me with Jeff.

508
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,361
Oh, so that's why you're here.

509
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,086
- You don't trust I'm still going to do it.
- Because you haven't done it yet,

510
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,168
and you have a history
of making poor decisions

511
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,770
when things aren't going your way.

512
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,921
The only poor decision I made

513
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,690
is agreeing to cover
for you in the first place.

514
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,649
You didn't think that was such a bad idea
when you were using it

515
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,608
to get what you wanted.

516
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,285
And now, you're threatening
to take that thing away.

517
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,767
Louis, you want
to keep Joan, that's on you.

518
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,805
But I held up my end of the bargain.
You better hold up yours.

519
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,801
MIKE: I just want to go over it
one more time, Professor.

520
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,606
- How much money was in that pot?
- I'm tired of going over it.

521
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,281
Why do we have to keep replaying
every moment of this game?

522
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,164
Because your entire case depends on it.

523
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,363
My case depends on the fact
that I won that money gambling,

524
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,482
not whether I won it with a flush.

525
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,364
Your case depends
on the judge believing you.

526
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,687
And if he finds any holes
in your testimony, then we...

527
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,882
I gave you the names
of everyone I knew at that game.

528
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,128
But none of those men were there
when you won that money.

529
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,925
I can't help it if I didn't get the name
of the guy I beat.

530
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,361
Which is why your story
needs to be rock solid.

531
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,922
Okay. Go ahead.

532
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,726
So, I ask you again, Professor,

533
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,524
how much money
was in the final pot?

534
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,644
- Roughly $12,000.
- And you won that hand?

535
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,366
As I said before,
I won and then I cashed out.

536
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,369
And what did you have again?
I had a queen-high flush.

537
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,563
- And who did you beat?
- I told you, I didn't get his name.

538
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,843
- Okay. So, what did he have?
- Two pair, queens over sixes.

539
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,765
Wait a second. You said before

540
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,764
that the man next to you
folded with two queens up.

541
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,207
And now this guy had two queens
and you had a queen-high flush?

542
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,847
I said that the man next to me
folded with two kings.

543
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,803
- No, you didn't.
- You heard me wrong.

544
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,490
No, I didn't.

545
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,723
Is this part of prepping me
or are you accusing me of something?

546
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,525
- I'm trying to get your story to line up.
- My story does line up.

547
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,244
- Not to me, it doesn't.
- Look, young man,

548
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,169
if you're going to
sit over there and call me a liar...

549
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,965
I'm not calling you a liar. But if you say
tomorrow what you said today,

550
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,525
we're going to be in a lot of trouble.

551
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,041
Because where I come from,
there are only four queens in a deck.

552
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,605
I said two kings.

553
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,603
And I'm going to
say that again tomorrow.

554
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,884
So you do your job
and I'm going to do mine.

555
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,201
- MIKE: He's lying.
- What are you talking about?

556
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,971
Gerard's story about winning all
that money playing poker is bullshit.

557
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,764
All right, slow down.
What the hell happened?

558
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,530
I did the math
and the hands don't add up.

559
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,841
What do you mean,
you did the math?

560
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,883
I mean, first, he said
that he drew a queen on fourth street.

561
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,365
And then, when I pressed
him about it, he told...

562
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,328
Wait a second.

563
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,601
This conclusion is based

564
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,722
on him recalling hands
under cross-examination?

565
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,127
Harvey, I got kicked out
of Atlantic City for counting cards.

566
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,890
- I know this shit.
- That doesn't mean he's lying.

567
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,411
I've got a little
experience with that, too.

568
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,601
And I'm telling you he was.

569
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,882
- Or maybe he's tired.
- Or maybe I'm right.

570
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,684
Or maybe you don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

571
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,724
- Why are you defending him?
- Because you asked me to.

572
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,721
Look.

573
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,208
Harvey. I'm not saying
that he took a bribe.

574
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,608
I'm just saying that he didn't get
that money playing poker.

575
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,249
Well, unless he admitted that,
he's testifying tomorrow.

576
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,321
Since when do you stick
your head in the sand?

577
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,682
- Did he admit it?
- No, he didn't.

578
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,723
But he screwed up the details.
And he shouldn't have,

579
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,810
because people who
are telling the truth get it right.

580
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,604
And you know it.

581
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,731
- What's that?
- Jacks full of fours.

582
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,367
- I can see that. But why...
- Why is it staring you in the face?

583
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,006
It's what I threw down
the last time I won a huge hand.

584
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,884
It was six weeks ago,

585
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,483
and I can remember every hand
that every player at that table had.

586
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,802
Now, if you won money
the other night, you'd remember it, too.

587
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,081
I do remember.

588
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,283
- And as I explained to your associate...
- Yeah, stop bullshitting me.

589
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,609
Where the hell did that money
really come from?

590
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,451
Because if you don't tell me the truth,
I'm canceling that hearing right now.

591
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,961
It came from a student of mine.

592
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,121
- For what?
- In exchange for changing his grade.

593
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,405
- Jesus Christ. For $25,000?
- He was going to fail my class.

594
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,284
And that would have stopped him
from getting an offer from...

595
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,925
You goddamn hypocrite.

596
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,883
You preach about ethics
and you do this?

597
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,889
This is about ethics.

598
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,649
And you don't have
any idea why I did it.

599
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,202
I don't care why you did it.
I care about what you're making me do.

600
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,004
Because I'm not suborning pel'jury.

601
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,885
Well, you tell me
that you've never done anything worse.

602
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,285
I knew it.

603
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,925
You would do it for someone else,
but not for me.

604
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,967
You know what, Professor?

605
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,401
There's a small part of me
that actually thought

606
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,568
that you came to me
because you thought I'm the best.

607
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,887
But you just think I'll do
whatever it takes to win.

608
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,089
Isn't that what
makes you the best?

609
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,282
Get someone else to do your dirty work,
because I'm not suborning pel'jury.

610
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,960
(GRUNTING)

611
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,001
What are you doing?

612
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,407
Getting my blood flowing.

613
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,166
I've been sitting here all night
and restless leg syndrome

614
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,805
kills 14 people every hour.

615
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,967
I don't think that's accurate.

616
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,844
I don't care what you think.
What do you have?

617
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,564
I found a way to
fix things with Joan.

618
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,890
Okay. You're arguing
anything in R & D

619
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,207
is the intellectual property of the person
who suggested the product?

620
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,322
Until such time
that the results become public.

621
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,124
Which they did the second I sent
the board that letter.

622
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,811
Except board members are subject
to the non-disclosure agreement.

623
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,689
Well, the board members haven't signed
a non-disclosure agreement.

624
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,841
Yet.

625
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,609
- What's to stop them from refusing?
- Nothing.

626
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,489
But if they do,
then the non-compete kicks in.

627
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,762
Preventing them from revealing
the contents of my letter

628
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,770
- under threat of prosecution.
- Specifically corporate espionage.

629
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,882
Oh, my God!
You got this idea from...

630
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,490
- Our bylaws.
- My bylaws.

631
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,728
Rachel, holy shit, this is...

632
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,481
Acceptable.

633
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,608
I think the word you're
looking for is "awesome."

634
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,848
Well, the word
I'm saying is get out.

635
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,325
Because I have
a meeting to prepare for.

636
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,568
You know what, Louis?
I have been working all night

637
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,921
and this gets your ass
out of a major sling.

638
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,605
So instead of dismissing me,

639
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,245
you should be asking me
to come with you.

640
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,600
Excuse me, Miss Professional.

641
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,961
You wanted me to treat you
like every other associate. Now I am.

642
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,081
By acting as if I did nothing?

643
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,168
No, by acknowledging
you did acceptable work.

644
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,567
Letting you come with me is something
that I would only do for you

645
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,569
if we were friends.
Which we are not.

646
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,531
You canceled the hearing.

647
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,520
You were right.
He was lying.

648
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,927
I'm sorry.

649
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,164
You know, I knew he was a hypocrite
after I found out about the gambling.

650
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,647
But I never thought
he'd sell out Harvard.

651
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,601
What are you talking about?

652
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,849
He did take the bribe, but it had nothing
to do with the accident victims.

653
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,082
He did it to change someone's grade.

654
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,487
- Why would he do that?
- What difference does it make?

655
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,682
Either way, he was going
to let me suborn perjury.

656
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,962
It makes a difference
because we still have to win this case.

657
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,970
Oh, I don't give a shit
about winning this case. (SCOFFS)

658
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,603
I've never heard
you say anything like that before.

659
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,803
You... You care about
winning every case.

660
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,285
Every game.
Every argument.

661
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,681
Did you hear me?
He was going to let me subom perjury.

662
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,009
So would every client you have
if they thought they'd get away with it.

663
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,281
He's not every client.

664
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,447
No, he's one you hated in the first place.

665
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,722
- I didn't hate him.
- Harvey, what is going on here?

666
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,330
I thought he was better than us.

667
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,641
I sat in that class
and I listened to him talk

668
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,762
about what kind
of lawyers we should be.

669
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,649
And I always let him down,

670
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,161
because I knew
that wasn't the kind of lawyer that wins.

671
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,961
And I wanted to win. So I'd argue
with him and he looked down on me.

672
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,800
And now,
instead of you letting him down,

673
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,886
he let you down.

674
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,881
He turned out to be
no better than any of us.

675
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,811
So then, let's make him better than us.

676
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,402
- Ms. Walsh.
- You are not on my schedule today.

677
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,841
Ms. Walsh, please,
take a look at this.

678
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,847
What is it?

679
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,928
- It's a chance to make things right.
- Huh.

680
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,851
You cannot call board
members employees

681
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,962
based on them having access
to an expense account.

682
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,809
Not just an expense account.

683
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,048
They have corporate cards
and standing offices.

684
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,960
Which, as defined by Section 14.2
of the Internal Revenue Code,

685
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,525
makes them employees.

686
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,451
Well, Mr. Lift,

687
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,370
it seems I won't be demanding
a new point person after all.

688
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,604
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Huh. Are you?

689
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,610
Of course I am.
You're my first client as name partner.

690
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,801
You're very important to me.

691
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,965
Well, I suppose
we'll find out the truth

692
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,570
when someone else
makes name partner.

693
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,566
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not an idiot.

694
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,808
I know that no one in your firm
wants to deal with me.

695
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,763
That's not true.
In fact, I fought for you.

696
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,530
You may have thought
you were fighting for me,

697
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,808
but I know that
Jessica dumped me on Harvey.

698
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,730
And it seems that
the second you made name partner,

699
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,046
Harvey did the same thing to you.

700
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,162
Oh, you didn't know that, did you?

701
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,681
Then maybe we were
meant for each other,

702
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,723
since we're both left out of the club.

703
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,882
You betrayed me.

704
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,883
You make this big speech
about repairing our friendship

705
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,088
- and all it was was more words.
- What are you talking about?

706
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,929
You convince me to take Joan,

707
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,089
while conveniently leaving out the fact
you're doing Harvey a favor?

708
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,005
That's not why I did it, Louis.

709
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,929
Well, just tell me right now.
Can he stand her?

710
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,691
No. But he was going to
keep her, because you...

711
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,167
Hurt his precious feelings?
I know. I felt so awful about that.

712
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,281
You know what, Louis?
You should.

713
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,925
And while you're at it,
you should feel pretty awful

714
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,201
about being a dick to me right now.

715
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,484
- You lied to me again.
- No, Louis, I fought for you. Again.

716
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,648
No. You made Joan
sound important.

717
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,240
The first client that Jessica gave Harvey
when he made name partner.

718
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,930
She is important, Louis.
But you can't see that

719
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,041
because you didn't
want a client.

720
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,804
You just wanted to take something away
from Harvey.

721
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,921
What I want is respect.

722
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,283
Then get out of your own way
and get on the goddamn team.

723
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,442
You mean the team
that kept Mike's secret from me?

724
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,370
No, Louis! I mean the team
that protected its own.

725
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,687
Because that's what teams do.

726
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,929
And you know,
I shouldn't even be telling you this

727
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,041
because she wasn't going to.

728
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,811
But if you need a little bit more evidence
of what we do for each other,

729
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,241
then take a look at Rachel,
because she got Katrina a job.

730
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,887
- What?
- That's right. Your former associate.

731
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,162
And you've been
treating Rachel like shit.

732
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,681
So if you're done yelling at me,
then I suggest

733
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,326
you go fix one of the thousand things
that you have screwed up lately.

734
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,523
Because the rest of us?
We are done fighting for you.

735
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,361
Mr. Ross.

736
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,121
You must be Ian.
And please, don't call me Mr. Ross.

737
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,765
- Mike is fine.
- Oh, sure.

738
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,248
Hey, thanks for your call, Mike.
Pearson Specter is a great firm.

739
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,771
Yeah, well, you're a great candidate.

740
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,689
I'm a little curious
why you're still interviewing.

741
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,643
I heard you had
a solid offer at Skadden.

742
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,081
I do, but Skadden Arps
is no Pearson Specter.

743
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,122
(BOTH LAUGHING)

744
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,446
Are you sure it's not
because you're worried

745
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,530
they'll find out that you failed
Professor Gerard's legal ethics class?

746
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,530
- What?
- Oh, shit. You don't know.

747
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,970
He hasn't changed your grade.
But he still has your $25,000.

748
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,926
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm exactly who I said I was.

749
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,970
The only thing I left out is that
Professor Gerard is my client.

750
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,801
Come on. He can't be
in trouble for this. I'd know.

751
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,361
He's not. He's being
accused of accepting a bribe

752
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,370
while conducting
a federal mediation because of this.

753
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,847
- That's not my problem.
- It's your problem now.

754
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,566
Which is why you're going to sign this.

755
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,366
What is that?

756
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,723
It's a sworn affidavit stating the money
that you paid Gerard is a loan.

757
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,805
- What happens to my grade?
- It stays the same.

758
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,764
Because Henry Gerard
doesn't take money to change grades.

759
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,325
That's bullshit. We had a deal.

760
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,522
Yeah, well, consider this your first
lesson in the real world.

761
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,926
Deals change.

762
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,684
I don't care what world it is.
I'm not signing anything.

763
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,121
That's too bad.
Because the truth will come out.

764
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,769
And this way, you're failing a class

765
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,168
instead of getting thrown out of school
for bribing a professor.

766
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,964
It's up to you, Ian.

767
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,129
You want an F? Or do you want
to not have a legal career at all?

768
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,609
GERARD: So I sign this
and the bribery allegations are gone?

769
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,007
And no one ever knows a thing.

770
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,881
But I still have to pay
Ian back the money.

771
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,801
- That's the way loans work.
- You say that like I am a monster.

772
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,604
I say it like it's true.

773
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,881
You know,

774
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,365
you never let me tell you
what the money was for.

775
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,608
You didn't listen to
me when I told you I don't care.

776
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,051
Who's the monster now?

777
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,881
I don't care because you always said
the circumstances don't matter.

778
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,003
Well, do you care that
after Mike grilled me,

779
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,726
I was so impressed with him that
I wondered why I had forgotten him.

780
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,605
So I looked through my old records,
just to see how he did.

781
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,170
But I couldn't find any record of him
ever being in my class.

782
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,809
Just like they're not
going to find any record

783
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,968
of you accepting
a bribe from a student.

784
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,201
Hmm.

785
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,246
- Are you saying we're even?
- I'm saying you got a two-for-one.

786
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,330
Because they're also not going to find
any record of you gambling last year.

787
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,727
That's why you came to see me
back then, isn't it?

788
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,243
You didn't want
anyone to find out about him.

789
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,689
I'm not going to tell you why I came
to see you last year, Henry.

790
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,167
Because the circumstances
don't matter.

791
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,281
(CHUCKLES)

792
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,886
You really did pay
attention in my class.

793
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,604
A lot more than you think.

794
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,721
I'm sorry I let you down, Mr. Specter.

795
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,121
Professor...

796
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,282
Don't worry about
paying back that loan.

797
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,680
I got it.

798
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,850
(SINGING)
Where do we go from here?

799
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,929
Where do we go?

800
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,607
And is it real

801
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,691
Or just something
we think we know?

802
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,448
And where are
we going now?

803
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,407
Mmm, where do we go?

804
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,684
Louis. What can I do for you?

805
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,643
The question isn't
what you can do for me, Jeff.

806
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,921
But it's a matter
of what you're going to do.

807
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,690
Which is cut
the bullshit right now.

808
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,605
- What?
- You heard me.

809
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,529
I know Jessica told
you about Hardman.

810
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,527
Yes, she did tell me.

811
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,404
And I have refrained
from coming to see you

812
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,409
about blackmailing her out of courtesy.

813
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,127
Courtesy? You haven't so much
as wished me a congratulations.

814
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,208
You want me to kiss the ring,
Louis, after what you did?

815
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,446
You're damn right I do.

816
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,327
Because I don't care how it got up there.
My name is on that wall.

817
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,121
And if I had a crowbar handy,

818
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,766
- I would pry it off.
- Well, Jeff, you don't.

819
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,564
So, the question you've
got to ask yourself is,

820
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,762
do you want to
stick with the team?

821
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,850
Because my name is up there to stay,
whether you like it or not.

822
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,843
Who can we trust
from here?

823
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,767
Who can we trust?

824
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,242
From cradle to grave

825
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,362
From ashes to ashes

826
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,884
From dust to dust

827
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,521
Hey.

828
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,845
Thanks for meeting me.

829
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,166
What's going on?

830
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,645
I wanted to thank you
for making me take Gerard.

831
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,601
What happened?

832
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,721
What makes you think
something happened?

833
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,966
Because I know you.

834
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,889
And I know you don't have
moments of self-reflection,

835
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,570
let alone have
a drink with someone

836
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,126
to tell them about it
unless something happened.

837
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,685
You know what?
Something did happen.

838
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,610
I dealt with some shit
and I'm trying to thank you for it,

839
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,564
because it turned out
to be a good thing.

840
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,281
I think the word
you're looking for is closure.

841
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,367
That's your word.

842
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,766
The word I'm looking for is,

843
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,281
"You're welcome, Harvey.
That's nice of you to say."

844
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,560
Thanks, Harvey.

845
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,050
Good. Now, listen to me.

846
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,401
For a minute there, I thought you were
going to tell me that he knows.

847
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,322
- What?
- Maybe I'm crazy.

848
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,570
But when I was prepping him,

849
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,967
for a second he looked at me
and I thought...

850
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,886
He's suspicious.

851
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,847
And then, you called, and after
everything that's happened already...

852
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,769
It's fine, Mike.
He doesn't know.

853
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,886
How do we move around
with all these eyes on us?

854
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,404
And all on us

855
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,281
