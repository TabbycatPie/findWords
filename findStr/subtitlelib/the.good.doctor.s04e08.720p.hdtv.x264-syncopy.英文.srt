18
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,700
Remeber how I told you my parents drop in unannounced?

19
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,620
I just got a text.

20
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,490
They are coming here tomorrow.

21
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,040
- Okay. - It's not "okay," Shaun, it's an ambush.

22
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,920
My parents don't come to visit, they come to judge.

23
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,500
They hate everyone I date,

24
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,380
which means they're gonna ask you a ton of awkward questions.

25
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,300
It's going to be uncomfortable.

26
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,260
Very.

27
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,970
Okay.

28
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,720
You hate surprises. Why aren't you more thrown by this?

29
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,680
Because it's not a surprise.

30
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,690
They're behaving exactly the way you said.

31
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:35,730
So a disaster is fine as long as it's a predictable disaster?

32
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,150
A disaster implies consequences.

33
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,280
We're adults.

34
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,240
Why would it matter what your parents think?

35
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,950
I don't know, because they're parents.

36
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,120
Doesn't it bother you

37
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,160
that your grumpy second dad Glassman still doesn't like me?

38
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,540
- Dr. Glassman likes you. - No, he doesn't.

39
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,170
- I have to go. - Fine.

40
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,920
But I'm gonna text you some talking points.

41
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,470
Mostly subjects to avoid.

42
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,300
And it's gonna be a very long list.

47
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,980
How long has she had this wound?

48
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,270
She fell off the vault two months ago.

49
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,360
Slow healing and signs of oral bruising.

50
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,320
Are you on a restricted diet?

51
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,280
Coach put me on a performance diet.

52
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,410
High protein, high fiber.

53
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,240
I can show you her training log. It's very standard stuff.

54
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,080
Although the noodles that she likes,

55
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,250
they did a number on my stomach, too.

56
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,290
- What noodles? - Konjac.

57
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,880
Girls on the squad eat them all the time.

58
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,920
Konjac noodles were banned in Australia several years ago.

59
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,720
They're dangerous, basically indigestible.

60
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,840
We will get another doctor

61
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,430
to assess your symptoms and do a workup.

62
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,510
But we need to get Darya to Imaging right away.

63
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,610
I review my schedule,

64
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,240
starting with the last appointment and working backwards.

65
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,530
It's an effective technique.

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,580
You might want to write this down.

67
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,750
Uncle Marcus, we had a deal.

68
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,290
No special attention.

69
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,380
That deal's off.

70
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,630
Livy, you're struggling,

71
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,010
and I can't sit on the sidelines anymore.

72
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,720
But special treatment from my uncle,

73
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,630
it's only going to make things worse.

74
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,510
I owe it to you, and I owe it to this hospital.

75
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,260
I know you have unique talent.

76
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,680
So you've noticed both that I'm screwing up

77
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,310
and that I have unique talent?

78
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,980
I noticed the talent long before you started here.

79
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,980
Aunt Tilly's annual barbecue.

80
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,240
You gave this to me when you were five years old.

81
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,240
And that moment, I knew you were special.

82
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,080
Giant mass of fiber blocking entry to her intestines.

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,340
Her blood tests also show low calcium

84
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,960
and other nutritional deficiencies.

85
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,420
Can I see the 3D reconstructed images?

86
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,510
It's unlikely to pass on its own.

87
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,180
We'll have to break it up and remove it endoscopically.

88
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,310
She also needs to quit gymnastics.

89
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,230
She has severe osteoporosis with compression fractures

90
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,270
in almost all of the thoracic vertebrae.

91
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,480
Interesting.

92
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,520
She is a 14-year-old girl

93
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,440
with the bone density

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,900
of an 80-year-old woman.

97
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,960
You have kyphoscoliosis,

98
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,340
caused by insufficient diet and overtraining.

99
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,630
We need to surgically stabilize across the deformity

100
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,550
to prevent the spine from failure and paralysis.

101
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,510
Spinal fusion...

102
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,020
that means that she can't compete, right?

103
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,350
Yes.

104
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,100
And the Games, they're less than a year away.

105
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,270
Could we wait until after to have the surgery?

106
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,520
If left untreated,

107
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,690
there's a 20% chance of progression,

108
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,570
which could lead to respiratory failure

109
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,610
and death.

110
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,160
It's your call.

111
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,380
I take risks every day.

112
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,800
I'm not giving up my dream.

113
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,090
You're 14.

114
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,640
It's not your call.

115
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,560
Her mother passed away when she was a baby.

116
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,430
And my father just told you it's my decision.

117
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,650
Coach is my dad.

118
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,570
Do what you need to do to clear the blockage,

119
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,860
but leave her spine alone.

120
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,030
She wants to risk her life for a trophy,

121
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,990
and her dad is okay with that.

122
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,500
I mean, that has to be some form of abuse.

123
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,790
This hospital is not gonna win a lawsuit

124
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,040
against a caring father who supports his daughter's dreams.

125
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,050
All you can do is pull him aside

126
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,260
and try to convince him to be responsible.

127
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,340
Yeah.

128
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,890
Convincing people to be responsible

129
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:17,760
has not been my strong suit lately.

130
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,100
We're not still talking about Coach Dad, are we?

131
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,350
You've been avoiding me.

132
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,150
I've been busy.

133
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,440
Recovering from a motorcycle accident that you lied about?

134
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,820
There's nothing to tell.

135
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,440
I hit a patch of wet pavement.

136
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,610
Well, Audrey...

137
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,990
You have PTSD.

138
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,620
I'm dealing with it.

139
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,080
I don't think you are.

140
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,630
Well, I also have a truckload of other things to deal with,

141
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,750
including the annual surgical fundraiser

142
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,300
Glassman just dumped in my lap.

143
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,170
Yeah, parties, they're important.

144
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,930
I'm dealing with it.

145
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,280
How long have you had the severe heartburn?

146
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,740
Uh, six months, maybe a year.

147
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,280
BP is 142 over 90. That's a little high.

148
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,240
Yeah, well, Darya and I travel a lot for competition.

149
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,540
I don't take care of myself.

150
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,330
Prioritizing your work over health is a bad idea.

151
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,670
For you and your daughter.

152
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,710
Thank you.

153
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,460
But may I kindly remind you,

154
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,760
how long are the shifts that you doctors work?

155
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,800
High stress, no sleep.

156
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,220
When something is important, huh, you give it all you got.

157
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,890
True. But we're adults. Darya's not.

158
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,470
Yeah, but she's very different from other girls her age.

159
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,350
I mean, Darya, she works her butt off.

160
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
She's earned my r... respect.

161
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,280
You okay?

162
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,110
Oh, I'm feeling some kind of chest pain.

163
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,780
His oxygen sat and pressure's dropping.

164
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,850
Possible MI, lung problem, or aortic aneurysm.

165
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,580
Secure his airway.

166
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,960
Poor perfusion. I think he's septic.

167
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,340
And vitals aren't improving.

168
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,300
Might be a spontaneous pneumothorax

169
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,880
and trapped air in his chest.

170
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,880
No, his chest would sound like a kettle drum.

171
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,010
There's fluid in there.

172
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,600
Give me a blade, curved clamp, and a chest tube.

173
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,440
Boerhaave syndrome is easily misdiagnosed.

174
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Nice catch with the percussion technique.

175
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,650
You may have saved this man's life.

176
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,900
Give me more retraction.

177
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,610
These tissue planes are terrible.

178
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,450
We're gonna have to debride the mediastinum.

179
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,080
There's too much damage to repair the esophagus

180
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,910
without risking a chronic fistula.

181
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,620
The ongoing leakage into his chest

182
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,080
means it would just be a matter of time

183
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,590
before he dies from an infection.

184
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,800
The safest approach would be to permanently divert the esophagus.

185
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,550
And he'd have to eat through a tube for the rest of his life.

186
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,640
But I don't see a better option.

187
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,680
In 24 hours, with broad spectrum antibiotics and drains,

188
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,900
the infection could clear and give us more options.

189
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,860
Which buys everyone time to come up with another brilliant win.

190
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,200
Does she really call her own father "Coach"?

191
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,620
He is her coach.

192
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,160
What do you call your father?

193
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,120
- Abba. - Pass.

194
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,960
Frank.

195
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,960
That's his name.

196
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,420
Do you respect any traditions?

197
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,470
Not random ones.

198
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,970
Why should we create labels for things that already have names?

199
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,140
It's not just what Darya calls her dad,

200
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
it's how they act with each other.

201
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,350
They're like coworkers.

202
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,310
That doesn't sound bad.

203
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:54,850
If I were meeting Lea's coworkers tomorrow,

204
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,270
she would be much less anxious.

205
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,190
Family is supposed to make you anxious.

206
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,860
Introducing a new boyfriend to your parents, it's a big deal.

207
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,320
It's a rite of passage.

208
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,240
Polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia.

209
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,660
Torsade de Pointes.

210
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,500
We need magnesium sulfate two grams IV.

211
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,710
- Heart rate's 170. - She's not responding.

212
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,170
Move in the defibrillator.

213
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,140
- Charged to 100 joules. - Clear.

214
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,940
Did we do something wrong?

215
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,060
No.

216
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,860
Which is puzzling.

217
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,150
Mistakes by first-year residents are expected,

218
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,120
but cardiac arrhythmia in a 14-year-old is definitely unexpected.

219
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,540
I was gonna ask if you wanted a ride,

220
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,250
but if you're working late...

221
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,790
Twenty hours to figure this out.

222
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,630
You sure you want to waste one of them driving home and back?

223
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,760
I think while I drive.

224
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,840
Not as well. Not in the car. Not at home.

225
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,390
Too comfortable, too many distractions.

226
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,510
Better to buckle down here,

227
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,520
where, as a bonus, your colleagues can see you.

228
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,730
I was under the impression that results are more important

229
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,350
than how a doctor is perceived.

230
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,730
And Jordan is running rings around you there, too.

231
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,150
Results don't matter if you can't make people listen.

232
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,570
Is that why you didn't want to perform the esophageal diversion?

233
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,490
You didn't hear me?

234
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,210
I made a decision for the good of the patient.

235
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,210
Now,

236
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,460
it's up to you to prove me right.

237
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,060
She has a prolonged QT interval and sporadic extra beats.

238
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,640
I'm gonna get the newbies

239
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,770
to recheck the renal panel

240
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,400
and order endocrine and genetic studies.

241
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,070
I already did. Also a tox and drug screen.

242
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,950
Are you okay?

243
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,950
Lea's scared.

244
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,460
Then I should prepare myself.

245
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,590
There is definitely something about me her parents won't like.

246
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,710
No, Shaun.

247
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,420
You are who you are.

248
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,340
Who you are is great.

249
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,220
You've been preparing for this your entire life.

250
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,850
When you do something important for the first time,

251
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,810
like surgery, you practice.

252
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,100
I should practice meeting her parents.

253
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,440
Mm, how? It's not like there's a simulator

254
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,320
for learning how to navigate awkward social interactions.

255
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,780
There is.

256
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,830
But I need pizza.

257
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:08,000
{\an7}BGM: Moonlight in Soho by Chucho Merchan

258
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,130
Shaun, I'd like you to meet my parents, Pam and Mike.

259
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,170
Hi, Pam.

260
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,090
Hi, Mike.

261
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,600
Lea tells us you're a doctor. What specialty?

262
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,850
I am a surgeon.

263
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,770
What a shame. I hear surgeons are arrogant and overrated.

264
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,400
Morgan, I'm sorry,

265
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,650
but can you just give it a rest for half a second?

266
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm in character. Please address me as Pam.

267
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,790
I read recently that, while you're sleeping,

268
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,620
you accidentally eat eight spiders every year.

269
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes.

270
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,130
And I read that, sometimes, they lay eggs in your stomach,

271
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,380
and then you can have thousands of spiders...

272
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,300
Shaun.

273
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,760
You said not to disagree with him

274
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
when he says something wrong and pointless.

275
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,260
I didn't tell you to agree with him,

276
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,850
because that only gives him more wrong and pointless things.

277
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,480
Good. That's helpful.

278
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,360
Let's continue.

279
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,320
Did you know that Arizona doesn't have Daylight Savings Time?

280
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Saving.

281
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,700
It's "saving," not "savings." That's grammatic...

282
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,580
Wh... How am I supposed to know what is pointless?

283
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,580
Facts are facts.

284
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,960
Okay, okay, okay. This isn't gonna work.

285
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,340
We could spend the rest of the evening

286
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,470
teaching Shaun the fine but trivial art of how to finesse trivia.

287
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,720
But the real problem

288
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,180
isn't gonna be small talk and family bickering.

289
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,010
The real problem is what happens when Lea's parents

290
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,930
express real concerns about their daughter?

291
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,400
-What concerns? - Concerns any parent would have.

292
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,770
You two barely know each other,

293
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,070
you haven't been dating very long, now you're living together.

294
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,900
This relationship is moving too fast.

295
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,410
You're wrong.

296
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,660
I thought you said we shouldn't argue with your dad.

297
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,160
That wasn't my dad. That was 100% Glassy.

298
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,540
You can't prepare for how these evenings can go wrong.

299
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,080
Families are full of surprises.

300
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,540
Like how you don't like Lea.

301
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,010
I never actually said that.

302
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,530
A first-year all-nighter.

303
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,160
Brings back memories.

304
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,780
Not of myself, of course,

305
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,200
but of the losers who thought staying up all night

306
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,040
drooling on their laptops made them look like better doctors.

307
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,330
So, cure cancer yet?

308
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,920
I'm trying to find a new way to repair a ruptured esophagus.

309
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,010
"Fundic reinforcement with intercostal muscle flap."

310
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,340
Pretty cutting-edge stuff.

311
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,430
But why not go with diversion?

312
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,430
It's a lot safer.

313
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,760
Because "safe" is ordinary and boring. Like me.

314
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,850
My uncle thinks I need a win.

315
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,440
And the only way to do that is to be impressive, like Jordan.

316
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,270
Makes sense.

317
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,570
You agree?

318
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,820
That Dr. Allen is impressive? Yeah.

319
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,740
And everybody knows that

320
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,030
because Dr. Allen makes sure everybody knows that.

321
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,910
She and your uncle are cut

322
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,370
from the same fashionably high-end cloth.

323
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,950
So, I don't just need to be a better doctor,

324
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,290
I need to be a different person.

325
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,170
You might want to start by being a person

326
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,170
who feels a little less sorry for themselves.

327
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,510
Either you're an awkward, inconsistent loner

328
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,420
who's irritatingly apologetic about your best qualities,

329
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,430
or you're a quietly brilliant surgeon

330
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,350
whom others ignore at their own peril.

331
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,640
If you're the first one,

332
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,520
quit now and stop wasting resources.

333
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,480
But if you're the second, be that.

334
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,480
Maybe a little louder.

335
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,250
Claire should we start?

336
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,500
Centerpieces, appetizers, color schemes?

337
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,130
Please tell me that you're at a hotel in the middle of the day

338
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,630
because you're having an affair.

339
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,090
There were no surgeries scheduled,

340
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,260
so I decided to volunteer to help.

341
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,390
How helpful. Hmm.

342
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:26,350
We can get the job done in half the time

343
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,970
and still have time to talk.

344
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,230
Or we can just talk.

345
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,440
I am not a 14-year-old girl

346
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,900
whose next backflip could kill her, Claire.

347
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,270
I don't need saving.

348
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,240
What do you think about twinkle lights?

349
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,280
Too prom?

350
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,330
Our tests show that your heart problems

351
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,540
are being caused by excess estrogen levels.

352
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,920
And we want to know how it got in your system.

353
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Medication? A supplement?

354
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,900
Coach gave you my training logs.

355
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,260
You know as much as I do.

356
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,140
We also know that you're in a very competitive sport,

357
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,220
so maybe there's something

358
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,100
you're taking that's not on the training log.

359
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,390
If you are, we can't divulge that to anyone.

360
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,480
You think I'm doping?

361
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,810
No way.

362
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:16,020
- If your coach is pressuring you... - He's not.

363
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,900
I'm sure it's a one-time thing.

364
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,440
Keep monitoring me. I'll be fine.

365
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:27,840
Darya, you've made your dreams come true by being stubborn,

366
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,160
being relentless, and just making things happen,

367
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,080
but that's not how your heart works. Or your spine.

368
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,500
She's not being stubborn.

369
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,300
It is going to go away, isn't it?

370
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,880
Because you are taking something.

371
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,260
And now you're going to stop.

372
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,980
Which means that it wasn't performance enhancing.

373
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,560
What is it for?

374
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,740
You took drugs for boobs?

375
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,200
The girl on YouTube said it would make them bigger.

376
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,280
Phytoestrogens used in herbal remedies

377
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,370
can cause swelling in breast tissue,

378
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:14,960
but there are potentially dangerous side effects.

379
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,330
What the hell were you thinking?

380
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,040
I didn't know it would make me sick.

381
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,960
I got tired of hearing the boys on the men's team

382
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,340
talking about women with curves...

383
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,010
What if it showed up on a drug test?

384
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,300
What if you got banned from the Olympics?

385
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,140
It's natural. It doesn't mess with performance.

386
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,350
- Other girls... - I don't care about other girls,

387
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,430
and I didn't think that you cared about other girls.

388
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Are you...

389
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,110
I can't believe that you're willing to risk everything

390
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,030
for something so childish.

391
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,740
It's not childish.

392
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,660
I give a lot to my sport.

393
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,660
I just wanted something for me.

394
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,380
You're not an adult.

395
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,980
Fix her heart

396
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
and her spine.

397
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,230
What? You can't do that. Are you punishing me?

398
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,530
I'm doing my job.

399
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,780
I'm your father, and we're a family,

400
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,950
and it is my job to make good decisions when you won't.

401
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,040
Since when is being my father your job?

402
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,170
We never do anything but talk about gymnastics, not even Mom.

403
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,550
If you didn't think I needed my father after she died,

404
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,550
why start now?

405
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,510
Darya...

406
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,010
I'm calling the team lawyer and filing for emancipation.

407
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,430
You think I can't make my own decisions? Try this one.

408
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,350
You're fired, Coach.

409
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,290
We could try T-tubes.

410
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,420
Using them results in the formation

411
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,670
of a controlled fistula and route for drainage.

412
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,150
Interesting. But the patient would still have a long recovery

413
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,090
and chance of reinfection. What else?

414
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,930
I found some very interesting research

415
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,470
on endoscopic vacuum therapy.

416
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,260
It's under investigation for the management of esophageal leaks.

417
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,480
Definitely innovative, Dr. Allen, but a little too much so.

418
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,980
This concept hasn't even gone through clinical trials yet,

419
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,940
and we need to perform surgery today.

420
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,360
Dr. Jackson, you've been quiet.

421
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,820
I was thinking about fundic reinforcement.

422
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,910
My idea is to use the patient's own good tissue

423
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,830
to reinforce the primary closure.

424
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,950
In this case, using the stomach as the patch.

425
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,600
Like the way we use a skin graft for third-degree burns.

426
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,710
Well, he'd be at risk of a diaphragmatic hernia.

427
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,740
Not if we cinch up

428
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,930
the lower esophageal sphincter with a fundoplasty.

429
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,710
Shaun, Lea tells us you're a doctor. What's your specialty?

430
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,870
I am a surgeon.

431
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:47,260
But we are not all arrogant. Though many of us are.

432
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,620
I'm still not sure if that's good or bad.

433
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,700
Is it hard? For you?

434
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,500
I mean, it's a difficult job.

435
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,650
Shaun is excellent at his job.

436
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,760
So, how do you feel about vaccines?

437
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,890
Oh, my God.

438
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,980
Because, they worry me.

439
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,560
They don't worry me.

440
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,670
- Oh. - Really?

441
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,540
Because we've read a lot of stuff.

442
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,450
Especially since Lea told us about you.

443
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,010
Vaccines don't cause autism, Mom.

444
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,020
Want to talk about religion now?

445
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,740
I think that that was on the list of things not to talk about.

446
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,110
Lea wrote you a list?

447
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,170
- Dad. - Well...

448
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,850
Honestly, Lea, if we're so impossible to talk to,

449
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,510
why even have us here?

450
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,170
Hemorrhoid surgery.

451
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,040
- Excuse me? - Want more wine?

452
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,540
I removed a hemorrhoid

453
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,730
from a patient with terminal cancer.

454
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,530
He only had a few months to live, and nothing would change that,

455
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,140
but the surgery did make him more comfortable.

456
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,270
I suggest we treat this evening like hemorrhoid surgery.

457
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,100
Now, that's... That's a good point.

458
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,710
You don't have to give him any more lists. Let him talk.

459
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,790
I like this guy.

460
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,030
Okay.

461
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,900
To hemorrhoid surgery.

462
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,810
To hemorrhoid surgery.

I'm... I'm so relieved to hear that.

470
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,840
Well, once.

471
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,810
The doctor said my symptoms warranted medication,

472
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,000
so I haven't been back since.

473
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,780
Why? If you need medication...

474
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,300
Why did you keep your PTSD a secret?

475
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,400
You chose to deal with your issues privately,

476

on your own terms.

477

Doing something self-destructive

479
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,490
is not a choice, it's a mistake.

480
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,150
Just like it was when I did it.

481
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,990
So, when I do something you agree with, it's great.

482

When I do something you disagree with,

483

- it's because I'm sick. - No.

You know, this is why I don't want to talk to you,

are timely diagnosis followed by viability of repair,

501
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,980
and with this innovative surgical approach,

502
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,940

into the intraperitoneal space.

506

There's an abscess behind the stomach.

507
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:43,110
It's making the entire posterior stomach friable.

508
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,730
What if we use an intercostal muscle flap

509
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,240
to patch the esophagus instead?

510
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,260
If we do that, it raises the risk of sepsis.

511
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,500
The patient signed off on risk.

512
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,450
- We should at least try. - Not this level of risk.

513
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,760
We need to do the diversion.

514
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,850
Your idea was good. Don't give up on it so fast.

515

Reverting to diversion doesn't mean failure.

00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,910

Dr. Andrews encountered complications.

00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,250
That's Andrews' call.

00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,060
I don't need details, just coffee.

or risk of death.

560
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
As his next of kin, it's your call.

561
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,130
I have to decide?

562
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,650
You made a life-or-death choice for yourself.

563
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,050
In fact, you insisted on it.

564
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,470
Well, that's different. The doctors were asking me

565
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,810
to give up something I really wanted.

566
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,250
The only difference is, your father is laying

567
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,710
on an operating table waiting for you to grow up.

568
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,730
If something bad happened, I'd be responsible.

569
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,610
Yes.

570
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,250
That's the definition of adulthood.

571
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,460
I don't know what to do.

572
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,020
Of course you don't.

573
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,690
It's an impossible choice.

574
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,870
Terrible things happen either way.

575
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,330
And, yeah, it's on you.

576
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,470
I can't do it.

577
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,290
I just can't.

578
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,480
You're not a grown-up, Darya.

579
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,460
Luckily.

580
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,190
So those of us who are will make the impossible decision for you.

581
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,200
Dr. Andrews will do the diversion.

582
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,770
Someone will bring you to see your father

583
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,420
when he's out of surgery.

584
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,010
What was that?

585
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,730
I saved that girl when you couldn't.

586
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,830
Yesterday, you told me to respect her decision.

587
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,140
Today, you tortured her into changing her mind.

588
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,240
Oh, did I make a little girl cry?

589
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,800
I can't do this. I'm done trying to help you.

590
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,170
Oh, please. You're never really done.

591
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,280
You know who you were last night?

592
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,200
My mom.

593
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,820
Drunk, angry,

594
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,080
refusing to lift a finger to help yourself,

595
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,180
lying about it, and taking your pain out on me.

596
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,920
It's gonna keep happening until you get help.

597
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,430
Take the medication, talk to someone,

598
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,340
do something.

599
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,670
Please.

600
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,310
I'm not your mother, Claire.

601
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,480
I'm not your responsibility.

602
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm your boss.

603
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,370
And I don't owe you anything.

604
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,910
Shaun? What are you doing here?

605
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,600
You're wrong about me and Lea.

606
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,110
Well, no offense, Shaun, but this is between family.

607
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,040
Lea is my girlfriend,

608
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,100
and the texts you sent were about us.

609
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,900
We're sorry you saw those.

610
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,770
Shaun, you're a very nice young man,

611
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:26,980
and we enjoyed meeting you.

612
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,440
It's just...

613
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,200
We've known Lea a lot longer than you have.

614
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,400
Yeah, she's, um...

615
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,830
Well, I mean, she has a good heart,

616
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,130
she just doesn't think ahead.

617
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:40,020
And she will do anything to get under our skin.

618
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,590
You wouldn't believe some of the people she's dated.

619
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,770
I'm different

620
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,570
than anyone she's ever dated.

621
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,440
How is that not a change?

622
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,870
That's true, Shaun.

623
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,170
I'm just not sure it's a good thing.

624
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,110
You knew her then.

625
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,140
You don't know her now.

626
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,710
All you know are her mistakes.

627
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:13,970
And you don't trust her

628
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,260
because you aren't sure you were good parents.

629
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,050
You said our relationship has challenges.

630
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,790
You're right.

631
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,040
Lea and I go through challenges together.

632
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,580
It's one of the things that makes us stronger.

633
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,120
Lea challenges me to try things,

634
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,260
even things I know I won't like,

635
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,640
because it is not always better to stop and think.

636
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,400
And I make Lea patient, because I can be very frustrating.

637
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,370
So can the two of you.

638
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,610
Maybe this challenge will make your relationship stronger, too.

639
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,550
If you really think I should have the spinal surgery,

640
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,350
I trust you.

641
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,190
I do.

642
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,030
I'm sorry.

643
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,050
Ever since your mother died,

644
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,620
I've been scared.

645
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,680
What did I know about raising a little girl all by myself?

646
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,910
And you... You were a handful.

647
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,580
Bouncing off the walls,

648
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,140
backflips off the furniture.

649
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,630
You couldn't get me to the gym fast enough.

650
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,980
Because when you were on the beam,

651
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,550
or flipping through the air,

652
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,800
you're not just a little girl.

653
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,610
You are an amazing athlete.

654
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,280
As your coach,

655
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,200
you make me feel amazing, too.

656
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,880
All this time,

657
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,610
I thought I was giving you exactly what you needed.

658
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,810
But I was wrong.

659
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,600
What you needed was for me to be your dad.

660
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,820
And what your dad would have told you,

661
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,340
that no matter how you look,

662
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:51,930
or what you achieve,

663
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,360
you will always be a beautiful,

664
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,400
strong superstar to me.

665
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,100
Thanks, Dad.

666
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,470
Thank you.

667
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,530
I like you. Okay?

668
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,940
Stop.

669
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,660
You're gonna make me cry.

670
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,450
You're a very cynical person, you know that?

671
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,240
Mm, actually, I'm not.

672
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,340
But you're a very grouchy person who cannot give a compliment.

673
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,850
You're funny. You're smart.

674
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,490
And you make Shaun happy.

675
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,650
Which I guess is a good thing,

676
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,240
but it also means you can make him very, very sad.

677
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,390
And that worries me, frankly.

678
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,660
I am not planning on hurting Shaun.

679
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,580
It's rarely intentional, you know?

680
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:29,740
My parents have an issue with Shaun.

681
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,200
And I just don't want Shaun's parent

682
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,950
to have a problem with us, too.

683
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,340
Too bad.

684
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,320
Everything Shaun has gone through,

685
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:55,210
all the rejection and the pain,

686
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,130
the victories, they all belong to him.

687
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,400
But I feel every single high

688
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,250
and every single low.

689
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,620
So, I'm sorry, I'm...

690
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,660
I'm not going to stop worrying about him,

691
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,540
even if he doesn't need me to.

692
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,920
Well, if Shaun saw that stain on your tie,

693
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,380
it would drive him crazy.

694
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:44,880
Hey, Liv.

695
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,220
I'm sorry we didn't get to perform your surgery,

696
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,800
but I'm really proud of the way you stepped up.

697
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,230
That surgery wasn't mine.

698
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,290
Of course it was, and it was brilliant...

699
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,080
And neither was the stone.

700
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,350
That story you told me about how you spotted my talent?

701
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,950
Um, I don't remember any of it.

702
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,360
I didn't paint that rock,

703
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,440
and if I handed it to you,

704
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,270
it didn't mean anything because I was five.

705
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,100
You have been carrying around a memory for over 20 years

706
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,030
that represents your dream, not mine.

707
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,020
Clearly, that's not entirely true.

708
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,190
You went to medical school.

709
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,540
Because I do want to be a great doctor.

710
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,680
I wanted it so bad

711
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,890
that I let you push me to think up some flashy surgery,

712
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,810
even when my instincts already told me

713
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,830
to do what I thought was the right thing,

714
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,710
and was the right thing.

715
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,770
Livy, I just want to help you be the best...

716
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,680
You want me to be Jordan.

717
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,860
If you're looking to mold someone in your image, she's perfect.

718
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,070
But, Uncle Marcus, I've got to be me.

719
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,720
And you can't help me do that.

720
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,410
I'm still gonna brag on you like a proud uncle.

721
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,500
You know that, right?

722
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,090
Dr. Jackson.

723
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,950
- It's your parents. - Yep, Shaun. I saw.

724
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,950
They probably want something.

725
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,320
We should prepare. Either they want to yell at us,

726
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,150
in which case, we should not answer the door,

727
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,760
or they could want to take us for dinner...

728
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,480
...but we are already halfway through...

729
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,030
They want to take us to dinner.

730
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,450
Should I open the door?

731
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,170
What do you think?

732
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,360
I think...

733
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,720
...they must have been good parents.

734
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,060
We should have dinner with them.

735
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,420
Do you want to text them back?

736
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,910
Last year, after my mom died,

737
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,540
I was going through some problems emotionally.

738
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,930
I was diagnosed with PTSD.

739
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,270
I see.

740
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,780
Melendez knew.

741
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,430
Morgan found out because she's Morgan.

742
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:12,120
But I didn't tell anyone else.

743
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,610
I... I didn't want anyone to know.

744
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,350
Why are you telling me this now?

745
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,520
Because

746
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,550
Lim is going through something like it, but maybe worse.

747
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,120
She isn't going to therapy.

748
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,900
She has refused medication. She...

749
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,060
Okay.

750
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,980
I don't think you should be telling me this.

751
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,940
Whatever Lim told you, she told you in confidence and as a friend.

752
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,560
But she's not just a friend. She's my boss.

753
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,740
You're her boss.

754
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,600
So I'm telling you because I have no place else to turn.

755
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,420
She won't let me help

756
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,870
because she says it's not my job. And she's right.

757
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,020
But it's your job to protect the hospital.

758
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,370
And her.

759
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,440
So...
