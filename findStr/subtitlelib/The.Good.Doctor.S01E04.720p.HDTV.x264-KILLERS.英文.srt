20
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,080
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:02,740
I'm your neighbor.

22
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,550
I'm in the middle of "Uncharted," And I'm dead.

23
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,950
Can I borrow some triple A's?

24
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,180
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

25
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,040
Our relationship... that we're hiding it.

26
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,340
We don't have a relationship.

27
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,740
We have sex.

28
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,810
- You're late. - No, the bus was late.

29
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,980
I did nothing wrong. The bus...

30
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,520
Yeah. This is gonna work out great.

31
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,270
So you're treating him like anybody else?

32
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,620
You have any idea how many patients

33
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,930
he's scared the crap out of today?

34
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,850
So teach him.

35
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,730
I'm teaching you both that he doesn't belong.

36
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,160
I hear you got Shaun off scut

37
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,110
and back into surgery.

38
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,460
You figure you'll give him a little authority,

39
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,930
he'll screw something up.

40
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,510
Either way, if he succeeds,

41
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,760
I'm the guy who just backed him.

42
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,350
And if he fails, I'm the president.

43
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,150
Hello. I've looked everywhere.

44
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,560
All right, I'm here now. We'll...

45
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,860
we'll just keep looking until you find it.

46
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,150
Why is the furniture in the middle of the room?

47
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,330
I know I packed it. I made a list.

48
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,060
"Star-tip screwdriver."

49
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,350
Look, it's checked.

50
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,510
It's checked.

51
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,490
Maybe you... you threw it out with the newspapers

52
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,320
you used to pack the dishes?

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,880
I packed with bubble wrap.

54
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,960
It's safer. And you can see through it.

55
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,770
Of course you did.

56
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,620
Shaun, there's a hardware store up the road.

57
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,670
You can buy a new one.

58
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,200
I don't want a new screwdriver!

59
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,470
I want my screwdriver!

60
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,610
Stop it!

61
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,640
It's the middle of the... I'm sorry.

62
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,070
I just shouldn't have yelled. J-Just...

63
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,580
Let's just take a moment. Sit down, please.

64
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,140
You know what? We can use this for now, okay?

65
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,120
I can't stay here.

66
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,330
Of course you can.

67
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,880
- It'll be fine. - I can't stay here.

68
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,040
The...dishwasher doesn't dry,

69
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,120
the shower drain has someone else's hair in it.

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,940
And the crisper drawer keeps coming off the track?

71
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,860
I assume that's what you were fixing.

72
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,680
I forgot.

73
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,940
Of course you forgot.

74
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,240
It's understandable.

75
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,150
You've been working your ass off.

76
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,700
You're exhausted. You're under a lot of stress.

77
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,410
There's a super in the building.

78
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,950
You can call him anytime.

79
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,300
Just make a list of the things you need repaired.

80
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,830
Later, Shaun. Later.

81
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,370
Later, Shaun!

82
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,700
Leave it now. Go to bed.

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,530
36 years old, 22 weeks pregnant.

84
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,850
Ultrasound at 16 weeks revealed a tumor on the fetus' tailbone.

85
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,370
Mom's got antiphospholipid syndrome.

86
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,610
Makes surgery high risk.

87
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,900
Also makes pregnancy high risk.

88
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,800
She's had three miscarriages.

89
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,980
We need to do an ultrasound and MRI

90
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,010
to measure the tumor's growth rate.

91
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,720
Late bus doesn't explain why you're showing up tired

92
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,700
after you just had 12 hours off.

93
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,060
We're all tired.

94
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,940
Our last shift was 36 hours.

95
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,210
I'm not interested in debating the shift schedule with you.

96
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,800
But I am curious why you always feel the need to defend him.

97
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,310
Well, we're all on the same team.

98
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,260
Yes.

99
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,890
But you're all quarterbacks.

100
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,920
And when training camp is over,

101
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,660
there's only gonna be one starter.

102
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,780
The crown-rump length of the fetus is 21.5 centimeters.

103
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,370
The diameter of the tumor is...

104
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,050
10.6 centimeters.

105
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,950
Half the size of the fetus.

106
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,110
The tumor's grown.

107
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,010
It's not cancer, but it is monopolizing the blood supply,

108
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,930
which is weakening the fetus' heart.

109
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,490
I'm sorry, but there's no chance it would survive long enough to be viable.

110
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,740
The safest course is to terminate the pregnancy.

111
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,610
If we were interested in the "safest course,"

112
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,750
we wouldn't be on our third "second opinion."

113
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,530
Please, Dr. Melendez,

114
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,090
we want whatever will save our baby.

115
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,330
Dr. Wright told us you've done fetal surgery

116
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,990
to remove this type of tumor before.

117
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,320
And without the tumor, our baby would be healthy.

118
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,670
Your antiphospholipid syndrome

119
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,050
makes a long surgery extremely dangerous.

120
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,860
There's a high chance for blood clots,

121
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,880
which could have fatal consequences for you.

122
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,380
We're willing to take that risk.

123
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,510
Saving the fetus doesn't do any good if the mother dies in the process.

124
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,610
I've had three miscarriages.

125
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,260
If I have to go through that again, I might as well be dead.

126
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,760
- Barb. - It's true.

127
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,750
No, it's not.

128
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,210
You're the strongest woman I've ever met.

129
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,710
We'll get through this.

130
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,860
We will. And... and then we'll try again.

131
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,090
We could manage clotting risk pre-operatively

132
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,690
with an infusion of unfractionated heparin.

133
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,060
Never contradict me in front of a patient again.

134
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,040
I didn't.

135
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,550
I agree with your assessment of the risks.

136
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,260
I suggested a way we could mitigate them.

137
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,790
Not in front of the patient.

138
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,770
We're not in front of the patient now.

139
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,240
I was just reading about a new technique

140
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,200
for transesophageal echocardiography monitoring.

141
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,670
If there's a cardiac issue,

142
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,510
it would give us an early warning.

143
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,870
Let's get her prepped. ASAP.

144
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,590
I want J.L. on anesthesia.

145
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,250
And let the neo-natal nursing supervisor

146
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,210
know that I want to do a full run-through.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,850
Damn it.

148
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,460
Yes?

149
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,930
Well, we're a little busy up here, too.

150
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,220
All right. I'll send someone.

151
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,450
Andrews is covering for Lim in the ER.

152
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,150
He has a patient who needs a boil lanced.

153
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,050
A plastic surgeon can't lance a boil?

154
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,320
Plastic surgeons can. Chief surgeons don't.

155
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,440
You and Murphy.

156
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,310
What?

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,690
It was our ideas that convinced you to do the fetal surgery,

158
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,200
and now you're punishing us with Andrews' scut work?

159
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,240
You're not getting punished.

160
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,320
He is.

161
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,060
For being late. Again.

162
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,160
But I don't trust him alone with a patient.

163
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,760
And since you like to defend him

164
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,770
and seem to know how to communicate with him...

165
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,960
Hurry back.

166
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,270
Olivia Hartman?

167
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,240
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,270
I mean Doctor.

169
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,220
You're 18?

170
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,090
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,180
Where's the boil?

172
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,310
It's... It's down there.

173
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,110
Down where?

174
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,120
Shaun. It's, um, on her labia.

175
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,540
Is it painful?

176
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,710
Like I used a bowling ball for a tampon.

177
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,360
Okay. Boils shouldn't hurt that much.

178
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,670
Okay if we take a look?

179
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,150
Okay.

180
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,050
If you just scoot down,

181
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,910
put your feet in the stirrups...

182
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,020
Great.

183
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,410
The swelling is fairly localized.

184
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,350
Extreme pain that's out of proportion to the visible injury

185
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,870
could mean you have necrotizing flesh-eating bacteria.

186
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,630
What?!

187
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,930
I'm gonna use the heparin pre-operatively

188
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,410
and a T.E.E. monitor.

189
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,440
Still not enough.

190
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,760
The risk of a heart attack or stroke was thoroughly explained.

191
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,380
The patient still wants the surgery.

192
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,770
She wants it? Or you want it?

193
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:02,920
Yes,

194
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,540
saving a fetus' life would be good news for me.

195
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,650
Any other questions?

196
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,590
Or insults?

197
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,130
Relax. I'm not insulting you.

198
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,940
Of course you want to do the surgery.

199
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,680
But you do surgeries like this,

200
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,220
some patients are going to die.

201
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,360
And then our department's success rate goes down,

202
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,190
and then our funding goes down,

203
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,640
and then you can't do surgeries like this.

204
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,330
So if your judgment is clouded in any way, just --

205
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,260
It's not.

206
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,340
Okay.

207
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,560
I'm sorry. I know this hurts,

208
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,090
but I really do need to insert a speculum for this part of the exam.

209
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,820
If I really have what he says,

210
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,160
does that mean you have to cut off my --

211
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,010
No. No, as I said,

212
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,500
the abscess is most likely the result of an untreated chlamydia infection.

215
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,970
We'll drain the abscess,

216
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,380
give you antibiotics.

217
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,450
You'll be fine.

218
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,090
I'm -- I'm sorry.

219
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,290
{\an3}The inflamed Bartholin gland is causing the ischiocavernosus muscle

220
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,270
to spasm and pinch the labial nerve.

221
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,170
You need to start with a more upward angle.

222
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,190
Can I try?

223
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,290
I think it's better if I do this.

224
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,720
Yeah, okay. Fine.

225
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,510
Can we, uh, call your parents? Let them know --

226
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,250
No.

227
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,120
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

228
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,140
Even adults need emotional support.

229
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,270
Someone to drive them home after surgery.

230
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,820
Uh, I'm gonna take a taxi.

231
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,730
I have money.

232
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,580
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

233
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,740
25% of college students contract an STD before graduation.

234
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,910
I'm not embarrassed.

235
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,660
And I know all about STDs.

236
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,660
I get tested every 30 days.

237
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,080
There's no necrosis on the vaginal wall or cervix.

238
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,740
You got it in already?

239
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,130
Yes. It's definitely not flesh-eating bacteria.

240
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,710
- I was wrong. - Thank God.

241
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,690
You do need surgery to drain the Bartholin gland abscess.

242
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,190
Why do you get an STD test every 30 days?

243
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,910
I have to. For work.

244
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,030
I do porn.

245
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,610
The umbilical is 19 inches,

246
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,920
which will allow us to remove the fetus via Caesarean

247
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,870
and rest it in its mother's lap while I excise the tumor.

248
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:25,610
Now, the hard part

249
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,210
will be reinserting the fetus afterwards.

250
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,350
We can't overstretch the uterine wall,

251
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,340
and we must be certain that every suture is tight enough

252
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,600
to handle four more months of kicks and thrown elbows.

253
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,840
Do you have a minute?

254
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,780
Can it wait?

255
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,600
No.

256
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,720
I don't want to do it.

257
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,070
Have you talked to your wife?

258
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,710
Yes, but she's not thinking rationally.

259
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,260
You heard her say she'd rather die than lose this baby.

260
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,550
I'm sorry, but husbands don't have veto power

261
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,310
over their wife's medical decisions.

262
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,220
A husband can't stop you from operating on his wife.

263
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,190
But a father can stop you from operating on his child.

264
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,280
What kind of porn?

265
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,240
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,420
I was too busy doing all the labs and imaging she needed for surgery.

267
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,340
I forgot to ask for her résumé.

268
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,110
I just mean, is she an actual actress,

269
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,670
like in stuff with a story, or...

270
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,750
Do they even make porn with stories anymore?

271
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,870
Sometimes.

272
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,410
You watch porn?

273
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,720
Why wouldn't he?

274
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,930
I don't know. He just seems...

275
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,480
He's a guy. All guys watch porn.

276
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,790
You finished with Andrews' patient?

277
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,290
No. It wasn't a boil.

278
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,760
It's a large Bartholin gland abscess that's pressing on her pudendal nerve.

279
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,860
Which apparently does interest a chief surgeon.

280
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,280
We're gonna assist Andrews when he drains it first thing in the morning.

281
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,360
We just thought we'd check with you.

282
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,170
Go home. And sleep.

283
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,740
Not play video games or whatever it is keeping you up.

284
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,110
I don't think it's video games.

285
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,670
You can head out, too. It's been a long day.

286
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,880
- But what about... - Fetal surgery's been put on hold.

287
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,710
What? Why?

288
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:17,620
Go home.

289
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,490
Once the fetus is removed from the uterus,

290
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,240
one could argue that it becomes a child.

291
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,380
That's ridiculous.

292
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,460
There are numerous legal precedents...

293
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,530
That guarantee the mother's right to choose.

294
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,240
It's her body. It's her control.

295
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,420
I'm completely comfortable going ahead with this surgery.

296
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:36,970
As am I.

297
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,740
I never was, and I certainly am not now.

298
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,940
I'm sorry. Until we're certain there is no liability

299
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,060
connected to parental consent, neither am I.

300
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,350
Well, the one thing I think we can all agree on

301
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,290
is that the mother has the power to do nothing.

302
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,280
And if she doesn't terminate

303
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,320
or have the surgery to remove the tumor...

304
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,680
A fetus with a massive tumor will die...

305
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,470
inside a patient with APS.

306
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,070
Then the mother would die, too, right?

307
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,690
So we do nothing, and they both die.

308
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,700
Or we can do something that's legally and ethically complicated,

309
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,310
and maybe they both live.

310
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,320
The board has approved the surgery.

311
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,540
Thank you.

312
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,330
- Barb, please... - Mark, stop.

313
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,730
- If you loved me... - No.

314
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,140
- No, do not say that. - No, it's true.

315
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,300
If you really loved me...

316
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,330
I'm trying to protect you because I love you.

317
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,300
I don't need your protection.

318
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,650
I need your support.

319
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,130
We'll start prepping you first thing in the morning.

320
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,040
Try and get some sleep.

321
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,430
Thank you.

322
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,720
I still can't believe it.

323
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,650
That 18-year-old college students do porn?

324
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,490
She's just not the type.

325
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,590
How do you know what "type" she is? You just met her.

326
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,360
Did one medical history and pelvic exam.

327
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,060
What?

328
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,630
Nothing.

329
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,820
No, go ahead.

330
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,010
Tell me all the reasons why I'm wrong.

331
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,620
I volunteered at a shelter for runaway teens when I was at high school.

332
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,900
Got to know a lot of sex workers.

333
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:50,550
They're not all the same, but they do have the same...

334
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,010
armor.

335
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,390
I don't believe it.

336
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,860
- You think I'm lying? - No.

337
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,120
No, I think you just opened up to me,

338
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,090
actually shared something personal.

339
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,620
It was high-school community service. It's not a big deal.

340
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,230
Oh, no, it's a big deal. This is huge.

341
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,670
- I am peeling the onion. - Shut up.

342
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,470
Actually, it's more like hacking through a coconut with a dull machete, but...

343
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,820
"Dull" is right. Very dull.

344
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,930
It feels good, doesn't it?

345
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,500
You should do it more often.

346
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:26,400
How about you stop worrying about what I won't do

347
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,270
and just enjoy what I will?

348
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,940
Do you think she's of sound mind?

349
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,510
You really want to talk about work right now?

350
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,720
She's basically threatening to commit suicide.

351
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,740
She's not suicidal.

352
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,550
She's... She's just desperate to have a child.

353
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,050
This is probably her last chance.

354
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,360
She could adopt.

355
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,850
- It's not the same. - Really?

356
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,270
You don't think there's a difference?

357
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,250
No, I don't.

358
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,490
Carrying a fetus in your body for nine months.

359
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,200
You don't think that creates a unique relationship?

360
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,600
I think every relationship is unique.

361
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,030
Yeah, of course.

362
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,740
What are you saying?

363
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,560
I just think it's selfish.

364
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,700
I mean, for her to go through so much,

365
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,900
to put your husband through so much,

366
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,710
just so you can have a certain experience

367
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,480
when there are other ways.

368
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,950
Yeah, okay.

369
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,710
But...you want children, though, right?

370
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,340
We've talked about this before.

371
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,460
Yes, I-I want children.

372
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,690
But our children.

373
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,490
Like, from you getting pregnant.

374
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,500
Yes.

375
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,520
But what if that doesn't happen?

376
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,100
What if I couldn't get pregnant

377
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,330
or if I decided that I didn't want to?

378
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,240
That I wanted to adopt instead?

379
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,920
Is there something you're not telling me?

380
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,330
Actually, there is.

381
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,100
When we're in meetings together,

382
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,260
don't ever call my ideas "ridiculous."

383
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,990
Come on, I'm being serious.

384
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,910
So am I.

385
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:02,750
You're right. I'm sorry.

386
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,170
It won't happen again.

387
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,500
Geez, you scared me.

388
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,000
- What're you reading? - Nothing.

389
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,960
- Can I read it? - No.

390
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,470
- Why? - Because.

391
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,600
Why?

392
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,940
Because.

393
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,650
Why?

394
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,650
Because there's nothing to read.

395
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,400
Just pictures.

396
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,100
Where'd you get this?

397
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,450
Colleen Myers.

398
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,890
Her dad has so many in his closet,

399
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,240
he doesn't even notice when she takes a few.

400
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,950
She's pretty.

401
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,860
She sure is.

402
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,970
It's bedtime. That means lights out.

403
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,740
I missed my stop.

404
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,900
I missed my stop!

405
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,240
Lynwood Place!

406
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,930
I need to get off at Lynwood Place.

407
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,330
Well, then you should've been paying attention

408
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,250
when I stopped at Lynwood Place.

409
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,200
Next stop's gonna be even further away,

410
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,340
so if I were you...

411
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,580
Shaun?

412
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,290
Are you okay?

413
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,170
Yes.

414
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,220
Are you waiting for someone?

415
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:26,670
No.

416
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,990
I'm horrible at directions, too.

417
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,070
Every time I exit a BART station,

418
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,650
I walk like three blocks before I realize

419
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,610
I'm going the wrong direction.

420
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,740
You're lucky I actually made it to the gym.

421
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,570
I like to go when it's not crowded,

422
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,830
but it's so hard to motivate after work.

423
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,890
Half the time I end up not...

424
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,950
You stink.

425
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,030
I know. I'm disgusting.

426
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,110
But I can't shower there.

427
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,410
I'm terrified of foot fungus.

428
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,180
Hey, you know, as long as we're tossing out truth grenades,

429
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,930
you suck at being a neighbor.

430
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,130
First, you take back your batteries,

431
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,110
and then you wake me up in the middle of the night

432
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,620
stomping around and banging on pipes.

433
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,730
What the hell's up with that?

434
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,080
My sink drips.

435
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,570
I couldn't sleep, so I tried to fix it.

436
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,860
Then I couldn't find my screwdriver, which made me anxious.

437
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,820
You kept me up because you were anxious about a screwdriver?

438
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,720
Yes. I was very anxious.

439
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:25,940
You're funny.

440
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,410
I stink. You're anxious.

441
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,140
You always say exactly what's on your mind.

442
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,190
It's the total opposite of most guys.

443
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:37,750
It's nice.

444
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,620
Good night.

445
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,200
And don't go fixing any faucets tonight.

446
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,410
That's Armen's job.

447
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,930
This is a list of repairs I need for my apartment.

448
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,010
Number 33.

449
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:19,860
What the hell is your problem?

450
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:21,930
Sorry. Hello.

451
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,170
My name is Shaun Murphy. It's very nice to meet you.

452
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:28,890
No, it's not nice to meet me at 12:40 a.m.

453
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,760
Yes.

454
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,190
Dr. Glassman said I can call you any time I need something fixed.

455
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,600
Who the hell is Dr. Glassman?

456
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,720
He's the president at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

457
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,210
I'm a surgical resident there.

458
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,750
Well, I don't care if you're St. Bonaventure himself.

459
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,190
Unless it's a fire or flood,

460
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,010
I only work 9:00 to 5:00.

461
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,370
I'll...

462
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,860
try and come back tomorrow between those times.

463
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,700
You already woke me up. Just give me the damn list.

464
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,470
It's my fault.

465
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,400
I should've known you would take what I said literally.

466
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,300
It's okay.

467
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,150
Actually, you know what, Shaun?

468
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,220
It's not my fault.

469
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,800
It's your responsibility. You're smart.

470
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,080
You should be able to use your common sense.

471
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,430
When somebody says something,

472
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,690
you should figure out what they really mean.

473
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,000
And when things don't go exactly how you expected them,

474
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,230
navigate that.

475
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,790
There's a thing called a Personal Support Worker.

476
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,040
Think of it like a home health aide.

477
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,100
No, thank you.

478
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,620
I can take care of myself.

479
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,590
Everybody needs a little help now and then.

480
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,190
I-I'm thinking of asking them to give me one.

481
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,130
I've lived by myself a long time.

482
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,880
In Casper, Wyoming.

483
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,150
Everybody looked out for you in Casper.

484
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,830
Everybody looks out for everybody in Casper.

485
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,510
This is San Jose. It's a big city.

486
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,580
And residency is a whole lot more demanding than medical --

487
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,710
I don't need an aide.

488
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,730
We're just talking, Shaun.

489
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,760
- I don't need an aide! - Okay, okay.

490
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,540
- Okay. - Okay.

491
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,390
Okay.

492
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,480
We'll table it for some other time.

493
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,330
Let's enjoy our breakfast, okay?

494
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,380
Mr. Allen?

495
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,010
I'm trying to convince her to save herself.

496
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,010
I don't want to roll the dice with my wife's life.

497
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,150
But she does.

498
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,180
We're gonna start prepping her now,

499
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,160
and she goes into the O.R. in a few hours.

500
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,910
I understand why she's desperate.

501
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,950
But not why you are.

502
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,360
If she dies, it's your fault.

503
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,570
And what if she lives?

504
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,770
You're gonna have a wife and child who need you,

505
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,660
and you keep driving her out of your life.

506
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,080
I'm not desperate.

507
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,840
I'm confident.

508
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,270
Which should make you feel better.

509
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,740
Retraction.

510
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,770
I'll make the incision,

511
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,340
and then I want you to insert the Word catheter.

512
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,200
Good job on the pelvic exam, Dr. Murphy.

513
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,940
With all this swelling, it couldn't have been easy.

514
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,760
Thank you.

515
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,070
How do you know who...

516
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,750
Oh, I have my ways.

517
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,970
Like Santa.

518
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,070
I told him.

519
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,470
No presents for you.

520
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,750
Insert the drain.

521
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,650
But I'm curious.

522
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,710
How could a guy who can't even shake a co-worker's hand

523
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,480
be comfortable doing a pelvic exam?

524
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,780
People squeeze too hard. It hurts.

525
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,860
Send this to the lab for culture.

526
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,330
So, I'm guessing you're not that into hugs.

527
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,600
I don't like to be squeezed.

528
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,540
Well, what if it's somebody you like?

529
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,090
Or somebody you love?

530
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,480
Have you ever had a girlfriend?

531
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,550
I almost kissed a girl. Once.

532
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,900
Well, you know what they say --

533
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,320
If at first you don't succeed...

534
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,870
Are you trying to mock me or encourage me?

535
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,620
I'm trying to get to know you

536
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,010
so I know when I should mock and when I should encourage.

537
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,220
When's the right time to mock you?

538
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,990
Press harder on that abscess.

539
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,140
It should have drained by now.

540
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,410
Something's wrong.

541
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,970
The gland's evacuated, but the swelling's not going down.

542
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,450
Heart rate and BP are stable.

543
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,070
Can I get a little more light, please?

544
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,890
- Damn. - What is it?

545
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,610
The swelling isn't going down because there's a mass beneath the abscess.

546
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,850
And it's not just pressing on the pudendal nerve --

547
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,400
It's totally engulfed it.

548
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,160
That's bad.

549
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,140
Very bad.

550
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,650
You're done already?

551
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,890
We were able to drain the abscess.

552
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,010
I already feel better.

553
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,740
That's only because of the pain meds.

554
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,290
The reason the pain was so severe

555
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,950
was because it wasn't just an abscess.

556
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,950
There's perineal myoma underneath.

557
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,440
What's that?

558
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,970
A fibroid tumor.

559
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,870
It's not cancerous, but it is wrapped around the nerve.

560
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,480
We need to remove the tumor,

561
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,150
but to do that, we will have to sever the nerve.

562
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,110
You'll lose all feeling in your genitals.

563
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,020
I'm so sorry.

564
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,550
I knew it.

565
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,820
God's punishing me.

566
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,400
No, absolutely not.

567
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,500
This is just a random growth...

568
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,720
You're religious?

569
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,960
Yes.

570
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,260
Or at least I used to be.

571
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,830
I haven't thought about God in a really long time.

572
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,780
But being in here...

573
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,960
You sure you don't want us to call your parents?

574
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,920
No. I couldn't bear to see the look on their faces.

575
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,570
Especially my dad's.

576
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,240
Well, that's what parents are for.

577
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,390
So you don't have to do these things alone.

578
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,430
Could you tell your father you're a whore?

579
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,050
You made a mistake. That is all.

580
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,500
- Patient vitals? - Stable.

581
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,900
- Fetus? - Stable.

582
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,190
Okay.

583
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,740
Is everybody ready?

584
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,730
Knife.

585
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,770
Retractor.

586
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,930
Okay.

587
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,350
Cutting into the uterus.

588
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,320
T.E.E. is showing anterior wall hypokinesis.

589
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,200
Systolic pressure 90. Get me a Swan.

590
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,860
I.V. function is decreasing. She's having a heart attack.

591
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,100
I need you to close the incision.

592
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,360
- On it. Needle driver. - Get a fluoroscope in here!

593
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,960
I'm gonna prep her for a balloon pump.

594
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,360
Barbara?

595
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,090
There was a complication during surgery.

596
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,650
A blood clot blocked an artery in your heart.

597
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,430
We were able to catch it in time.

598
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,750
And my baby?

599
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,260
The fetus is stable.

600
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,890
The M.I. happened before we opened the uterus.

601
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,590
So, we're right back where we started?

602
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,120
You just had a heart attack.

603
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
I don't care.

604
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,780
There is no other option now.

605
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,340
If we don't terminate and the fetus dies in utero,

606
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,840
the resulting clots will overwhelm your heart and brain.

607
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,020
Which is exactly why we need to try again.

608
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,140
What're you talking about?

609
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,570
You need to remove the tumor.

610
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,580
You begged me not to do the surgery before.

611
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,510
I thought I could talk her out of it then.

612
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,840
Now I know I can't.

613
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,410
Either you do it, or she dies.

614
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,350
Before, if we got sued,

615
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,080
we'd at least have one of them on our side,

616
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,110
but now, with them both aligned --

617
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:09,340
Can they sue us for not operating?

618
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,620
They could argue that we abandoned care.

619
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,970
We're still offering care.

620
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,300
Just not the care that they want.

621
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,540
Which is your fault.

622
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:19,080
If you hadn't offered her hope to begin with,

623
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,620
we might have been able to reason with her.

624
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,710
How's the pain around the incision?

625
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,280
5 out of 10.

626
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,510
I'll up the dosage.

627
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,900
Any chest pain?

628
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,370
No. My heart actually feels fine.

629
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,340
Good.

630
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,450
If she doesn't want to terminate, there's nothing we can do.

631
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,740
So we just send her home to die?

632
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,810
It is her decision.

633
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,330
We could tell her we were going ahead with the fetal surgery.

634
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,340
But once she's under --

635
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,840
I'm gonna pretend you never said that.

636
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,440
If it's the only chance to save her life --

637
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,930
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

638
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,270
You wouldn't lie to convince a suicidal person to climb down off the ledge?

639
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,670
Knowingly lying to a patient about a major medical surgery --

640
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,710
Okay, okay! Hey!

641
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,200
Lying to a patient is one thing.

642
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,170
Performing surgery without their consent --

643
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,710
It's unethical and illegal.

644
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,850
And insane.

645
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,070
I just...

646
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,440
I don't want to do this.

647
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,220
It's not our only option.

648
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,620
You want me to attempt the fetal surgery again?

649
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,140
If it's the only way to save her life.

650
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,200
The first time, it was the only way to save her life.

651
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,560
But a second heart attack one day after the first

652
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,420
- will kill her. - Maybe not.

653
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,170
I am so sorry to interrupt, but I...

654
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,850
I have an idea.

655
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,580
What if we kill her before she kills herself?

656
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,020
We'll stop your heart

657
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,860
and put you on a bypass machine for the duration of the surgery.

658
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,000
You can't have a heart attack

659
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,680
if your heart's not beating to begin with.

660
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,810
It takes the most significant danger off the table.

661
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,050
But aren't the clots a danger to her brain, as well?

662
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,320
This doesn't completely eliminate every risk,

663
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,870
but it does reduce the biggest one.

664
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,870
Thank you.

665
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,820
We'll do it first thing in the morning.

666
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,210
You fixed my sink!

667
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,270
Do you know how to tell time?

668
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,760
You fixed my sink!

669
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,610
You're welcome. Now go away.

670
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,100
It was not on the list!

671
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,920
The faucet. It was not on the list.

672
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,390
You weren't supposed to touch it.

673
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,770
So after I fix everything you woke me up for,

674
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,680
then I go out of my way to fix something el--

675
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,530
It was not on the list because I'd already fixed it.

676
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,400
Well, you fixed it wrong.

677
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,810
Because it was still dripping.

678
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,040
I need it to drip.

679
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,360
At the same rate as my sink in Casper.

680
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,650
It was too slow before.

681
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,140
Now I have to fix it all over again.

682
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,180
It's not fair.

683
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,150
I'm done.

684
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,980
If you don't like your faucet

685
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,740
or anything else in your apartment? Move.

686
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,150
If you knock on this door again after 5:00 p.m.,

687
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,020
I'm gonna knock your teeth out.

- Nerves are like pipes! - Shaun, th-- this --

711
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,690
We need to sever the pudendal nerve to excise the myoma,

712
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,100
but if we reconnect the ends...

713
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,210
The tumor is 4 centimeters in diameter.

714
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,330
That's way too wide of a gap to reconnect the ends,

715
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,530
and nerves don't stretch.

716
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,090
We don't need to stretch it.

717
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,650
We can connect the distal end of the pudendal nerve

718
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,450
to the branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve from her inner thigh.

719
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,740
Would you rather lose feeling in your thigh or genitals?

720
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,690
Thigh, definitely.

721
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,380
Is he right?

722
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,720
Can we do that?

723
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,200
It probably would've been better to discuss this prior

724
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,020
to meeting with the patient,

725
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,290
but, yes, I think it could work.

726
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,680
Cut the suture.

727
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,770
Grafted nerve's in place. Let's see if it will conduct.

728
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,760
Conduction electrodes are in position.

729
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,900
Send a pulse.

730
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,110
Again.

731
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,240
Again.

732
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,190
- Again. - Okay, Murphy, we get it.

733
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,540
Your idea worked.

734
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,920
Good job. Both of you.

735
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,410
- Thanks. - Thank you.

736
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,190
I'm guessing Melendez doesn't let you know this enough,

737
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,280
but you both are doing a great job.

738
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,580
And if either of you needs anything, even just to talk,

739
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,820
my door's always open.

740
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,810
4-0 Vicryl.

741
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,720
Yes doctor.

742
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,860
4-0 Vicryl.

743
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,910
She's on bypass.

744
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,780
Cross clamping the aorta.

745
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,750
You ready?

746
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,800
- Flush the heart. - Flushing.

747
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,870
Let's prep her for C-section.

748
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,140
Dr. Andrews.

749
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,220
The operation went perfectly.

750
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,060
But I don't feel anything down there.

751
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,090
You're still on the meds, so it's gonna --

752
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,840
It's going to take six months to a year to regain complete sensation.

753
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,420
It'll take a while for your brain to figure out what we did.

754
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,620
But the grafted nerve is fully conducting.

755
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,950
You're gonna be fine.

756
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,100
Thank you.

757
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,830
- Can you do me a favor? - Sure.

758
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,660
- Call my parents. - Absolutely.

759
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,330
- Knife. - Knife.

760
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,430
Bovie.

761
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,980
Bovie.

762
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,570
How're we on bypass?

763
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,370
- Dr. Kalu, you still with us? - Yeah.

764
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,860
Central venous pressure's good.

765
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,730
Bypass oxygen tension's 200.

766
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,450
Good. Repairing the fetal sacrum.

767
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,610
Gonna put this baby back where it belongs.

768
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,190
Baby?

769
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,730
That's the first time you didn't call it a fetus.

770
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,370
Just an expression.

771
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,500
I told you.

772
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,490
Yes, you did.

773
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,810
You're gonna need to stay in bed for the next four months...

774
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,570
but both you and your son's prognosis is excellent.

775
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,110
We wanted it to be a surprise.

776
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,240
Rookie mistake.

777
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,160
Yes!

778
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,230
We are definitely celebrating tonight.

779
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,250
Screw sleep, Murphy.

780
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,720
You are coming with us.

781
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,770
Where are you going?

782
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:10,130
- Out. We're gonna drink. - I'm not thirsty.

783
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,090
Don't be an idiot.

784
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,010
I just meant...

785
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,920
Come on, mate.

786
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,330
You just saved an 18-year-old girl's sex life.

787
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,220
And I saved two lives.

788
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,570
We are drinking.

789
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,440
Come on, Shaun.

790
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,310
Okay.

791
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,050
Cool.

Hi, Shaun.

Hi, Colleen.

805
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,430
I heard Steve showed you my dad's magazine.

806
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,290
Did you like it?

807
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,390
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

808
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,790
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

809
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,480
All guys like that kind of stuff.

810
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,430
You want to know a secret about me?

811
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,520
I think you're really cute.

812
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,890
You smell like bubble gum.

813
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,990
I know. It's my lip gloss.

814
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,690
Come here.

815
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,470
Come here, silly.

816
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,140
Do you think I'm pretty?

817
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,830
I like you, too.

818
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,220
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

819
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,340
Come on. I'm curious.

820
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,950
You must be curious.

821
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,740
Can I have a kiss?

822
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,960
I want to know what it feels like.

823
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,450
I'll give you a kiss...

824
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,530
if you show me.

825
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,230
Show you what?

826
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,510
You know. Pull down your pants.

827
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:36,450
No.

828
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,920
Come on, Shaun.

829
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,430
No. I gotta go.

830
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,730
Oh, my God. I can't believe you were about to pull it out.

831
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,810
No, I wasn't!

832
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:48,520
And like I'd ever kiss a creepy weirdo like you.

833
