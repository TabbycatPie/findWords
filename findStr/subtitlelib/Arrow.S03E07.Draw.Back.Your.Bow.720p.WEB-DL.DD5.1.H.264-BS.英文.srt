15
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,820
My name is Oliver Queen.

16
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,410
After five years in hell,

17
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,680
I have come home with only one goal--

18
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,860
to save my city.

19
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,770
Now others have joined my crusade.

20
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,980
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

21
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,940
To the rest of Starling City,

22
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,340
I am someone else.

23
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,650
I am something else.

24
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,800
Previously, on "Arrow"...

25
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,840
I killed him. The police officer.

26
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,990
Why didn't you tell me?

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,630
Because you were overdosed on Mirakuru;

28
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,520
You didn't remember, and I was hoping that you never would.

29
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,970
This city still needs saving,

30
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,800
and that is my vision for this company.

31
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Yes, I am your boss now.

32
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,890
I can quit, which is what I just did.

33
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,010
I thought that I could be me and the Arrow,

34
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,070
but I can't.

35
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,280
Say it's never going to work out between us.

36
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,430
Say you never loved me.

37
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,510
- Say you-- - Felicity...

38
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,580
I told you as soon as we talked,

39
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,100
it would be over.

40
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,390
You changed your mind?

41
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,850
I just decided I want more out of life.

42
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,650
Who the hell are you?

43
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,120
I'm Cupid, stupid.

45
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,810
In the last five minutes,

46
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,890
SCPD has had over 200 reports

47
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,400
of masked men attacking the city.

48
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,330
It's 3.8 miles to the bridge.

49
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,520
3.8 miles and a dozen Mirakuru soldiers.

50
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,440
- Stop. - Stop? We're already late!

51
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,670
Stop!

52
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,090
Everybody get back inside.

53
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,000
Isaac Stanzler.

54
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,070
Looks like the two of you got the same taste in outfits.

55
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,630
I thought he was in custody.

56
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,910
Yeah.

57
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,690
Corrections was transporting him to Iron Heights

58
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,370
when he got pin-cushioned.

59
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,970
By who?

60
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,580
Your guess is as good as mine.

61
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,780
But whoever it was went to a lot of trouble.

62
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,660
Dressing him up and dumping him like this?

63
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,710
I'd say our doer's definitely trying to get your attention.

64
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,060
Well, he's got it.

65
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,190
Any leads yet?

66
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,150
No.

67
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,130
The only physical evidence other than the body is this.

68
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,520
Shaped like a spade. What's that all about?

69
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,990
I don't know.

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,890
I'll look into it.

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,520
I'm not your mother

72
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,470
or your wife

73
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,060
or your maid.

74
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,480
Okay, all right, you don't like me, I get it.

75
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,420
At least you're perceptive.

76
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,900
I thought that last week,

77
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,450
we did the whole candle meditation thing,

78
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,860
and maybe we had a moment.

79
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,030
Moment's over.

80
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,790
You can celebrate by doing your own laundry.

81
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,430
- What? - I--

82
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,340
I don't know how.

83
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,960
Where you going?

84
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,740
Waller just called.

85
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,660
New intel on this Li Kuan Hui

86
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,990
the Triad's interested in.

87
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,050
Mm-mmm.

88
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,240
- What? - My contact is down at the docks.

89
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,960
A gaijin would stick out like neon down there.

90
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,190
Gaijin?

91
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,890
It'll be fine.

92
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,450
I'll only be gone an hour.

93
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,080
What am I supposed to do?

94
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,920
Your laundry. Apparently.

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,020
What are you doing?

96
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,600
You were supposed to be at the press conference

97
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,080
20...minutes...ago.

98
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,130
Oh, god. I have a type.

99
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,200
You know Richard Branson works out twice a day?

101
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,250
He told me it gives him

102
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,070
20 additional hours of productivity a week.

103
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,590
I'm sorry, I can't hear a word you're saying

104
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,370
when you're doing...that.

105
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,680
Sorry. What's up?

106
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,640
The announcement?

107
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,480
There's a gajillion reporters and city notables waiting for you.

108
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,950
Oh, ha. Well, this will be interesting. Ha!

109
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,780
BTW, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,550
What?

111
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,400
I have a dinner with the CEO of a Nevada Mining Concern.

112
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,440
They own mineral rights,

113
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,520
which are imperative to the Cogeneration Project.

114
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,130
Oh, and I fit into this how?

115
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,140
Ahh, the CEO is boring.

116
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,160
His wife, even more boring.

117
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,960
If I'm forced to go solo on this,

118
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,250
I'll end up slicing my wrists open with a butter knife.

119
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,170
Well, I don't think a butter knife is going to...

120
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,240
do the job.

121
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,890
Oh, there will be steak knives there, too. Dangerous.

122
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,800
Well, I'm sure you have a dozen other employees

123
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,380
that would be better suited as your anti-boring wing woman.

124
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,630
Hundreds, actually.

125
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,620
But you are the one I bought this dress for.

126
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,010
This dress

127
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,770
costs more than my apartment.

128
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,200
Yeah, it's couture.

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,320
Which I'm pretty sure is French for expensive.

130
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,050
So, dinner?

131
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,180
Purely platonic.

132
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,390
There is nothing platonic about couture.

133
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,860
Fine. I'll have my assistant return it.

134
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,730
No, all right, I'll go! I'll go.

135
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,710
But only so I can wear this dress.

136
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,410
Of course.

137
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,700
You and I are going to be best friends.

138
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,450
Last time I saw a spade that lethal,

139
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,790
it cut up a pretty good royal flush I was holding.

140
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,610
Hand-soldered out of high-carbon steel.

141
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,720
Where'd you find it?

142
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,380
Isaac Stanzler's chest.

143
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,110
Ted Grant's psycho sidekick.

144
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,800
Was murdered while being transferred by the SCPD.

145
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,990
By an arrow. Think this is the same archer that killed Sara?

146
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,040
No. That one was different.

147
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,180
These bodies were staged, dressed up to look like--

148
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,630
Copycat archer. Guess all

149
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,250
that positive publicity you've been getting

150
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:05,880
has a downside.

151
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,230
Well, whatever the reason, we need to find him.

152
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,870
I would like Gelicity to do a work-up on all of this asap.

153
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,910
Copy.

155
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,880
Felicity's a little busy right now.

156
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,890
Doing what?

157
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,360
A few months ago, I made a promise

158
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,660
to help revitalize Starling City.

159
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,710
But I knew I couldn't do it alone.

160
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,330
I needed help. A lot of help.

161
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,560
From people who are even more intelligent

162
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,560
and dedicated than I am.

163
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,120
All of us are working very hard with one goal in mind,

164
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,700
to save our city. But to do so,

165
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,050
Queen Consolidated needs to be something else.

168
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,900
You ok?

169
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,930
I'm-I'm fine.

170
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,900
You don't seem fine.

171
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,260
What is this?

172
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,170
What's that, a note?

173
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,730
It's an address.

175
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:22,650
15 Baron Street, apartment seven.

176
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,370
Nobody's home.

178
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,330
These are all articles about the arrow.

179
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,770
This isn't just a copycat, this is a fan.

180
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,970
From the looks of it, a pretty dedicated one.

181
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,730
And this isn't a spade.

182
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,310
It's a heart.

183
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,660
It's you.

184
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,730
I can't believe it's really you.

185
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,640
Did you like your present?

186
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,810
Do you mean Isaac Stanzler, the man you killed?

187
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,680
I see the way you take care of your city.

188
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,480
Makes me wonder,

189
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,590
who takes care of you?

190
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,580
I want to help you,

191
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,360
to fight with you,

192
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,440
to kill for you.

193
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,230
Mr. Stanzler was just the first.

194
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,630
He might be the second.

195
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,880
I thought we could punish this one together.

196
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,130
I'm going to find you.

197
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,650
Well, that's the idea.

198
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,350
But you'd better hurry,

199
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,120
I don't think he's got very long.

201
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,290
Roy.

202
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,240
I was just researching cheap booze for Thea's club.

203
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,820
You know, it wasn't you who killed that officer.

204
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,240
I keep telling myself that, but it's not working.

205
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,640
Every single time I put on that mask,

206
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,610
I feel like a fraud.

207
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,180
You, you have to give this time.

208
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,220
- If you want to talk about it-- - I don't.

209
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,400
I appreciate the offer, though.

210
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,730
I'm fine. Really.

211
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,670
Sorry, am I interrupting?

212
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,370
I was just leaving. I got to help Thea

213
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,010
get the club ready for the opening.

214
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,790
What's up?

215
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,510
I got an ID on your not-so-secret

216
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,880
but very crazy admirer's hostage.

217
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,160
- Who is it? - Joe gravano,

218
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,220
local mob boss, wanted for 39 counts of murder,

219
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,200
racketeering, and drug smuggling.

220
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,090
One of the most heavily protected men in Starling City.

221
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,340
Not anymore.

222
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,520
What's "N.P.P."?

223
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,620
I don't know.

224
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,420
I can definitely find out.

225
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,880
Where are we with the cell phone from her apartment?

226
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
Crazy pants encrypted the SIM card.

227
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,290
I can crack it, but it's going to take some time.

228
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,880
Which we don't have, neither does he.

229
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,260
I need 100% of your focus on finding Gravano.

230
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,640
And I will work round the clock on it, except for tonight.

231
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,310
Why?

232
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,940
Ray Palmer invited me to dinner.

233
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,640
Not dinner-dinner, like a date.

234
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,230
It's a work dinner, but since dinner

235
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,520
is a meal you can technically only eat at night,

236
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,900
I need the night off.

237
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,120
That ok?

238
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,980
Do what you want.

240
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,900
Nothing?

241
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,790
He's not answering his cell.

242
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,390
Just relax. I'm sure he's fine.

243
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,160
He said it would only be an hour.

244
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,700
That was nine hours ago.

245
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,720
If he's going to be late,

246
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,110
he always calls.

247
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,980
He said his contact was down at the docks, right?

248
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,390
I will go down and check it out.

249
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,220
No, I'll go.

250
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,950
No offense,

251
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,510
but you're just...

252
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,250
Maseo's wife.

253
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,500
And you just a billionaire

254
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,040
who doesn't know how to use laundry machine.

255
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,880
Do you have someone who can watch Akio for a few hours?

256
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,610
Great, thank you.

257
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,970
You were terrific.

258
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:58,350
Auditions are over. Thank for coming, guys.

259
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,520
Hey, peace out.

260
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,930
Wait, what are you doing? Auditions are not over.

261
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,680
Trust me, I'm saving you from wasting your day here.

262
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,510
I don't need saving from anyone,

263
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,040
and if you're really as good as you say you are,

264
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,530
then you can just wait in line and prove it like everyone else.

265
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,840
- I don't audition. - Then you don't work.

266
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,560
For me or for my club.

267
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,510
So...the exit's that way.

268
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,230
Later, princess.

269
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,770
I got her.

270
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,700
The user registered to the encrypted SIM card,

271
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,840
Carrie Cutter, she's former SCPD.

272
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,970
She was the first woman SWAT team member.

273
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,230
I've seen her before.

274
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,770
Well, she's not unpretty for a whacko,

275
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,530
if you're into the whole red-headed vixen-type thing.

276
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,040
She was a police officer, that might be why she looks familiar.

277
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,840
No, she left the force

278
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,310
once year before you got back from the island.

279
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,110
But there's another very good reason

280
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,440
she looks familiar.

281
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,930
Why was she at the crime scene at Ted Grant's gym?

282
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,330
I don't know, but it's not just there.

283
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,630
Apparently stalking isn't her only hobby, either.

284
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,570
She's a member of a gardening group, too.

285
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,460
Which explains the whole N.P.P. thing.

286
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,530
What N.P.P. thing?

287
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,880
The bag in the Gravano hostage photo.

288
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,640
N.P.P., it's an acronym-- stands for nitrogen, phosphate, potash.

289
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,400
It's the chemical formula for fertilizer.

290
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,240
So what if she's keeping Gravano in a greenhouse?

292
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,850
The closest one to her apartment is Sherwood Florist,

293
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,360
7884 Hauser.

294
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,460
- Have Roy gear up and meet me there. - Ok.

296
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,710
Roy...

297
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,930
Find Gravano. I'll take care of Cutter.

298
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,960
Got it.

299
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,970
Arsenal, there's no sign of Cutter.

300
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,660
Arsenal.

301
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,430
Arsenal!

302
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,100
Hello, lover.

303
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,110
If you hurt him...

304
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,430
I didn't touch him, boyfriend.

305
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,890
I'm a one-guy woman.

306
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,690
But I am a little disappointed you brought your wing man.

307
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,390
Tonight's not about him.

308
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,040
It's about us.

309
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,020
Together against the world.

310
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,500
Just like we were meant to be.

311
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,020
There is no "we."

312
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,740
We're more like one soul, you're right.

313
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,990
You and I are more alike than you think.

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,460
Carrie, listen to me.

315
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,820
You're not well.

316
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,060
If I'm out of my mind, it's because that's what love is.

317
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,800
Our own little slice of insanity.

318
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,100
Make a wish.

319
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,990
Mine's already come true,

320
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,250
for the two of us to be together forever.

321
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,330
Please help me.

322
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,490
Don't leave me with this psycho!

323
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,700
- Quiet! - You don't want to do this.

324
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,850
Sure I do.

325
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,780
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

326
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,310
That rope's laced with a trip wire

327
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,250
that's hooked up to a little thing on his chest

328
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,900
that goes, "Boom!"

329
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,520
So what do you want, then?!

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,100
Not much.

331
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,800
Just...you.

332
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,810
Never going to happen.

333
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,210
Such a party pooper.

334
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,350
I never thought I'd be happy to see you!

335
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,850
Roy.

336
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,040
Why don't you go home, man? It's been a long night.

337
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,310
She took me out. It shouldn't have happened.

338
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,640
You're not at your best.

339
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm fine.

341
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,740
Looks like you weren't the only person that Carrie stalked.

342
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,950
She was put on limited duty

343
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,180
after becoming obsessed with her partner.

344
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,770
The department sent her to St. Walker's for a psych eval.

345
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,510
She quit the force a little bit after.

346
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,210
Where's Felicity?

347
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,880
She's working tonight. She said she told you.

348
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,430
Yes, she did.

349
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,860
Oliver, you ok?

350
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,510
I know this can't be easy,

351
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,550
with Felicity spending so much time with Palmer.

352
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,300
I'm fine.

353
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,510
Where you going?

354
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,800
The psychiatrist that SCPD sent Cutter to.

355
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,910
You need back up?

356
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,310
No. I've got it.

357
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,090
Like what you've done to the place.

358
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,130
Is everything all right?

359
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,190
Yeah, yeah, I was just in the neighborhood.

360
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,740
Thought I would stop by and check out your new sign.

361
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,790
Oh, yeah.

363
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,880
Wow, that's a nice dress.

364
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,720
Yeah, it's really, really,

365
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,290
really nice.

366
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,600
Ray lent it to me for a work dinner.

367
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,770
Yeah, some...work dinner.

368
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,180
- You and Ray. - Mm-hmm.

369
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,130
Doesn't seem that platonic.

370
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,990
Actually, it has Oliver twisted up in knots.

371
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,850
Well, Oiver made his choice.

372
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,850
We both know that was a wrong choice.

373
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,380
And did Oliver say that?

374
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,900
Oh, yeah, because Oliver's just

375
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,830
great at expressing his emotions.

376
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,970
He would rather go ten rounds with the League of Assassins

377
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,210
than ever say that.

378
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,580
But this thing with you and Palmer,

379
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,380
it's,

380
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,780
it's messing with his head, Felicity,

381
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,900
and...

382
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,930
that's really dangerous.

383
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,950
I told you, there is no me and Palmer.

384
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,370
But if there were,

385
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,450
and if Oliver had a problem with it,

386
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,970
then Oliver should be the one to say something.

387
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,550
Ok.

388
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,050
Good night.

389
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,590
- Dr. Pressnall-- - Oh, my God!

390
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,970
I'm not here to hurt you.

391
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,910
What do you want?!

392
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,700
To talk about Carrie Cutter.

393
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,380
I can't.

394
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,340
Doctor-patient privilege. Just please, get out!

395
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,830
Your patient killed a man, kidnapped another,

396
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,740
and I'm trying to stop her before she hurts anyone else.

397
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,400
To do that, I need to understand her.

398
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,480
Please.

399
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,080
I can only diagnose her.

400
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,340
Attachment disorder,

401
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,050
the inability to form real, lasting relationships.

402
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,250
They push everyone away,

403
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,510
and fixate on a single person.

404
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,590
Someone they feel mirrors their emotional state.

405
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,020
How do I stop her?

406
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,090
Give her the connection that she craves--

407
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,690
honesty, sincerity...

408
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,480
If you lie to her,

409
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,130
she'll know.

410
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,960
Thank you.

411
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,030
If you'll permit a professional observation...

412
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,280
you could use a little therapy yourself.

413
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,730
What gives you that impression?

414
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,700
You mean, apart from the mask

415
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,700
and the Robin Hood costume?

416
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,360
Shouldn't we get out and look around

417
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Or, I don't know, something?

418
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,270
In this place, at this hour?

419
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,910
That's a very efficient way to get yourself killed.

420
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,490
Feel free.

421
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,510
Thank you.

422
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,520
That's... we'll wait, then.

423
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,790
"Gaijin."

424
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,960
What?

425
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,610
Maseo called me that before he left,

426
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,750
and I looked it up, but it wasn't in my Chinese dictionary.

427
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,850
Because it's Japanese.

428
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,100
It means "foreigner."

429
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,280
Outsider.

430
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,180
You.

431
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,470
It means you, too.

432
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,710
You're Japanese, living in Hong Kong.

433
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,930
Sorry.

434
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,650
Why did you leave Japan?

435
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,750
It wasn't safe for us there.

436
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,230
Why?

437
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,530
We upset some very powerful,

438
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,540
very dangerous men.

439
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,270
Who?

440
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,650
You ask a lot of questions.

441
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,960
That's what your husband says.

442
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,760
Who's that?

443
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,760
Shu Gang. Rivals of the Triad.

444
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,640
They control this port.

445
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,690
So they know what happened to Maseo.

446
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,910
I don't know.

447
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,310
Only one way to find out.

449
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,430
Hey, I don't want any trouble!

450
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,650
What happened to the thing?

451
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,300
You are ridiculous.

452
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,580
Which I mean in a...good way.

453
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,510
That's...not creepy.

454
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,000
You look beautiful.

455
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,070
I think it's the dress.

456
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,640
The dress is actually missing something.

457
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,190
Oh, no, I forgot to do up the zipper again?

458
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
I always do that.

459
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:07,780
Oh, no, I can't wear that.

460
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,030
I'm not even sure I'm supposed to be looking at it.

461
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,670
Well, I had to put down a $10,000 security deposit

462
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,310
just to borrow it for the evening, so

463
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,470
one of us should wear it.

464
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,840
And diamonds aren't really my thing.

465
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,090
I appreciate it, but I think I would

466
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,610
feel strange wearing a million dollar necklace.

467
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,710
Oh, don't worry.

468
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,880
It's not worth a million dollars.

469
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,690
I think it was actually appraised for

470
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,300
$10 million.

471
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,630
So...

472
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,300
There you go.

473
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,660
That's better.

474
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,310
Where you been?

475
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,880
You don't call, you don't write.

476
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,780
I've been busy, busy, busy.

477
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,010
You look good.

478
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,610
Business before pleasure.

479
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,630
First I located every crime scene

480
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:07,580
the arrow's been spotted at in the past six months.

481
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,550
Now the magic part--

482
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,760
I created an algorithm,

483
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,160
calculated the average amount of time

484
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,410
it takes the Arrow to reach a crime scene,

485
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,440
triangulated that by the distance to said scene...

487
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,760
Genius, right?

488
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,130
I wonder why no one thought to do it before.

489
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,310
Now obviously, I can't pinpoint the exact block, but,

490
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,680
there's no doubt your guy hangs his hat

491
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,770
or his hoodie Somewhere in this area.

492
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,560
And you're sure about this?

494
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,270
Statistical correlations do not lie.

495
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,080
Now...

496
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,440
what was this about pleasure?

497
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,030
I'm sorry.

498
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,820
I'm spoken for.

499
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,470
How'd it go with Cutter's shrink?

500
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,870
There's a reason I'm not in therapy.

501
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,460
- Detective. - Your new girlfriend

502
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,910
just put another heart-shaped arrow

503
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,590
in the neck of one of her old CIs.

504
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,650
Who was he?

505
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,200
Kirby Bates.

506
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,700
Some kind of computer expt

507
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,100
holed up in a flop house north of Amsterdam.

508
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,590
Did a five year bit in Iron Heights

509
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,290
for stealing a couple of million credit card pin numbers.

510
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,780
What did Bates do for her?

511
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,070
I don't know.

512
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,530
Everything here is smashed to pieces.

513
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,730
But smart money says,

514
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,090
whatever Carrie Cutter's planning next,

515
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,610
you're not going to like it.

516
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,300
Thanks, Detective.

517
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,270
We need Felicity here.

518
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,510
Oliver, she's still at dinner with--

519
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:53,820
I don't care where she is! We need her here.

520
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,170
You mean, you need her to be any place where Ray Palmer isn't.

521
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,590
It's not the time, Diggle.

522
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,130
Oliver, you're in the field without your head on straight.

523
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,490
I think this is exactly the time.

524
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,880
- I've got it handled. - Doesn't look that way to me.

525
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,160
What do you want me to say?

526
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,390
Yes,

527
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,540
it bothers me that she is out to dinner with Palmer.

528
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,510
Yes,

529
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,400
it bothers me that apparently she is just moving on with her life,

530
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,490
But I made a decision! She did, too.

531
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,570
And--

532
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,420
I just...I want her to be happy.

533
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,750
If that were true...

534
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,990
you'd be with her, man.

535
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,600
- Where you going? - Flop house on Amsterdam.

536
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,770
They're long gone by now.

537
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,920
Maybe she didn't get that far!

538
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,510
I'm here looking for my husband.

539
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,990
Thin beard, long hair,

540
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,850
Japanese.

541
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,580
Don't know any Japanese.

542
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,870
Try again.

544
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,770
I don't know anything!

545
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,040
A.R.G.U.S.

546
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,030
Does that mean something to you?

547
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,370
I don't know anything!

548
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,620
Except...

549
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,770
three men, this A.R.G.U.S., they work for them.

550
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,290
Worked.

551
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,840
What do you mean?

552
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,570
They're all dead.

553
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,410
Killed by Triad,

554
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,700
a few hours ago.

555
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,130
- Mr. Gardner. - Ray Palmer.

556
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,820
Good. Mrs. Gardner.

557
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,030
This is Felicity Smoak,

558
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,460
Vice president of Palmer Technologies.

559
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,310
- Hello. - Pleasure.

560
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,090
Thank you for sitting down with us tonight.

561
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,400
Well, I'm always happy to enjoy a good meal.

562
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,100
And I'm very impressed with your background.

563
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,840
But I have no plans of selling my Nevada holding.

564
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,360
The night is still young.

565
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,770
Shall we sit down? We have a lot to discuss.

566
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,090
As you said, the night is young.

567
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,070
But I don't like to talk business until at least the entre.

570
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,070
Maybe the DJ got confused

571
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,190
and he thinks he's at a rave.

572
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,390
I think my ears are bleeding.

573
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,060
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I--

574
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,560
You're fired.

575
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,460
What about the rest of the night?

576
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,780
I think my Spotify playlist

578
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,810
is a better option than you right now.

579
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,400
Whatever.

580
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,440
Need some help?

581
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,790
Just when I thought the night couldn't get any worse.

582
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,020
Thought I'd swing by,

583
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,280
see what kind of trainwreck this would be.

584
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,180
Oh, did I say trainwreck? Because this is...

585
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,330
Pow!

586
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,600
You know, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

587
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,650
Yeah. I think I'm the only one.

588
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,080
Oh, I just remembered-- I own a bar.

589
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,050
Half the gate and guaranteed gigs four times a week.

590
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,990
- Two times a week. - Three.

591
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,520
Fine. Just get these people dancing.

592
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,240
Obviously, the progeneration of certain minerals

593
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,120
can't be accounted for by simple elemental cohesion.

594
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,030
I am so sorry.

595
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,970
I had to help a co-worker with a thing.

596
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,050
I had to have them take the steak knives away.

597
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,100
I'm sorry.

598
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,540
Mr. Gardner, did Ray have a chance to tell you

599
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,410
about his plans for your mineral deposits in Nevada?

600
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,270
No, Miss Smoak, as I mentioned,

601
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,570
I'm not interested in selling.

602
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,850
Please, call me Felicity.

603
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,590
And I don't blame you for not wanting to sell Ray your mine.

604
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,620
Because you don't know what his plans are.

605
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,730
The thing about Ray is, he's not...

606
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,650
a businessman.

607
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,630
Businessmen make deals.

608
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,830
They make money.

609
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,850
What Ray is, is...

610
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,270
something else entirely.

611
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,830
Perhaps you can enlighten us.

612
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,490
He inspires.

613
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,420
Ray isn't interested in making money.

614
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,350
He's interested in making the world a better place.

615
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,900
So if Ray wants your mine,

616
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,370
believe me,

617
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,130
it's because he's going to put it to the kind of use

618
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,070
that's going to make you proud.

619
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,550
Yeah?

620
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,990
I spoke with Felicity.

621
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,200
I got her to remote access that laptop.

622
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,610
The last thing Cutter was looking at was a map.

623
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,600
And Oliver, Verdant was marked on it.

624
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,780
Felicity was also able to

625
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,420
retrieve Cutter's phone signal from the laptop.

626
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,200
Ok, patch me through, and then get upstairs

627
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,800
and do not take your eyes off of Thea, do you understand?

628
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,860
Copy that.

629
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,260
One Cupid's Kiss.

630
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,590
Delicious.

631
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,970
- Hello? - It's me.

632
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,420
I have to admit,

633
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,180
I didn't think a club would be your kind of scene.

634
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,310
You're always surprising me.

635
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,960
I'm not there.

636
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,600
Why don't I believe you?

637
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,010
You want to meet me, fine.

638
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,020
I will meet you anywhere but that club.

639
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,860
So you're asking me out.

640
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,960
Where do you want to meet, Carrie?

641
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,570
I know a place. Our special spot.

642
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,940
But you listen to me, lover.

643
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,820
I've been burned before.

644
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,490
And if you're playing me,

645
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,190
I promise you, I'll come back here

646
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,230
and kill everyone in this place.

648
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,790
Dig, you there?

649
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,390
And me. Me being Felicity.

650
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:44,530
- What's your 20? - Subway stop downtown.

651
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,100
Why did Cutter have you meet her there?

652
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,530
Because this is where I saved her.

653
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:01,620
Hello, lover.

654
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,900
I'm not your lover.

655
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,770
Well, maybe not yet,

656
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:09,090
but after one night with me, that'll all change.

657
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,040
I promise.

658
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,760
Carrie, I'm here to help you,

659
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,560
because you're not well.

660
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,580
Don't ever say that again.

661
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,370
You sound like that shrink that they sent me to.

662
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,700
I spoke to her.

663
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,220
You talked to that psycho?

664
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,780
She just wanted me to take pills, pills, pills.

665
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,370
She thinks that love is a disease.

666
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,400
But it's not.

667
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,840
Love is the cure.

668
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,110
Well, I'm not the man you think I am.

669
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,370
You're a hero...

670
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,550
Who saved me.

671
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,860
I understand that you're hurting.

672
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,120
And I know what it's like to want someone...

673
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,800
but not be able to be with them.

674
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,350
How you wish things can be different, but they can't.

675
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,090
I can't be with you.

676
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,990
I can't be with anyone.

677
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,830
I have to be alone.

678
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,820
No, you don't.

679
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,840
You're a liar!

680
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,020
I don't want to hurt you!

681
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,940
You already have.

682
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,120
It's over, Carrie.

683
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,840
I guess it's true what they say--

684
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,540
You only hurt the ones you love.

686
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,880
Oliver? Get him back. Oliver!

687
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,050
Sorry.

688
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,870
But if I can't have you--

689
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,480
Carrie, think about this!

690
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,610
I didn't want it to end this way.

691
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,740
I guess I don't handle rejection very well.

692
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,760
You don't have to do this.

693
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,650
I do.

694
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,760
But at least this way,

695
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,330
we can be together.

696
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,450
For eternity.

697
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,880
I knew you loved me.

698
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,940
Well, it's done.

699
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,990
Lyla said Cutter's even nuttier than the last woman

700
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,910
they had in the suicide squad.

701
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,180
You sure this was a good idea,

702
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,070
handing her over to Waller?

703
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,100
Iron Heights isn't right for her.

704
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,600
At least, on the squad,

705
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,780
she can make a difference.

706
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,580
Lyla is preparing a late dinner,

707
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,710
if you want to join.

708
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,780
No.

709
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,970
No, I'm good, thank you.

710
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,720
Listen, Oliver...

711
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,100
Felicity heard what you said to Cutter.

712
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,750
About being alone.

713
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,120
If her reaction was any indication,

714
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,250
she does not want to be.

715
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,150
You got to tell her how you feel

716
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,790
before it's too late.

717
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,460
It's just food for thought.

718
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,110
What do I tell him?

719
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,730
How do I tell my son his father is dead?

720
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,760
Where have you two been?

721
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,770
What's going on?

722
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,300
You're home.

723
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,090
I was so worried.

724
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,790
I know. I'm sorry. I should have called.

725
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,790
Waller changed my orders and brought me in.

726
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,380
We were on lockdown tonight

727
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,210
because three agents got killed.

728
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,700
Gross!

729
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,900
Akio, get over here.

730
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,600
Pretty good gate tonight.

731
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,540
You're never going to let me forget this, are you?

732
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:23,070
You have to admit, I did save your ass.

733
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,870
God, your modesty, it's-- it's so refreshing.

734
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,810
You know, you're really cute when you're sarcastic.

735
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,100
Half the gate, as agreed.

736
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,760
Keep the money.

737
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,340
My grand reopening gift to you.

738
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,120
See you next week.

739
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,070
I thought I might find you here.

740
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,160
I thought I'd get a jump on that server encryption you asked for.

741
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,220
Trying to,

742
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,100
you know, make up for ruining the deal tonight.

743
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,130
Your definition of ruin is vastly different from mine.

744
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,090
Gardner's going to sell.

745
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,490
That's amazing!

746
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,780
It's all thanks to you.

747
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,040
But really, I should be thanking you.

748
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,000
I mean, not just for the new job,

749
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,170
but for this amazing, expensive necklace.

750
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,190
You have to take it back, don't you?

751
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,050
Yeah, kind of do.

752
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,780
Here, let me help you.

753
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,540
Thank you.

754
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,040
You know, Felicity Smoak,

755
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,320
you're different from anyone I've ever met.

756
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,070
And you deserve all those things, and more.

757
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,910
I'm--I'm sorry, I, um...

758
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,730
I meant to keep tonight platonic. Ahh...

759
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:11,960
I should go.

760
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,100
Ray?

761
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,180
I'll see you tomorrow.

762
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,870
OK.

763
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,390
Are you OK?

764
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,820
Not really.

765
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,640
What about you?

766
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,710
Not really.

767
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,020
Come on.

768
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,130
Where we going?

769
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,590
For something we both need.

770
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,260
I know it's late, but, um--

771
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,840
Hey, that was the invitation.

772
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:07,540
Something smells good.

773
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,170
- Thank you. - Hi.

774
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,950
Come on in.

776
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,220
Yep, I just sent the notarized transfer of ownership

777
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,560
to Gardner's attorney.

778
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:26,050
Now listen, I want to get a jump

779
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,180
on the mining operations immediately.

780
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,500
Let me know as soon as the first

781
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,880
of the dwarf star alloy is extracted.

782
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,450
Thanks.

784
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,440
Whoever you are, back off!

785
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,600
Sorry to do this to you,

786
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,670
but you have something I need.

787
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,920
See, that's the thing about our work...

788
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:57,460
It always come back to haunt you.
