20
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,850
I'm incising the uterine wall.

21
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,190
You're doing great, really great.

22
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,400
It's gonna be okay.

23
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,070
You promise?

24
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,130
- Baby's out. - Umbilical clip. Suction.

25
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,030
Please --

26
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,820
can I see my daughter?

27
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,330
Yes.

28
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,450
Of course.

29
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,460
Sorry.

30
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,460
We'll need to get her into surgery.

31
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,040
We'll take good care of her.

32
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,230
Your New Chief is fashionably late.

33
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,770
Our Chief.

34
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,790
Just because I endorsed Dr. Han to the Board

35
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,290
doesn't mean I don't have any concerns.

36
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,750
Connections like Dr. Han's come at a premium

37
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,630
and, he assures me, will be well worth it

38
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,880
given our current predicament with the Medical Board.

39
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,610
I'm not just worried about the money.

40
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,880
When you pay that much,

41
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,490
they tend to think they're worth it.

42
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,550
Makes a person think they don't have to show up

43
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,120
for their own welcome brunch.

44
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,280
The baby's bowel protrusion

45
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,760
seemed less severe on the prenatal imaging.

46
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,490
And it'll have to wait 

47
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,100
until we're done with her heart problem.

48
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,940
Now that I'm in here, her septum looks more like Swiss cheese.

49
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,690
Page the on-call neonatal cardiac surgeon.

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,990
That won't be necessary. I'll scrub in.

51
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,410
And who are you?

52
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,320
I'm Jackson Han.

53
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,120
Your new Chief of Surgery.

54
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,340
Echo probe, please.

55
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,010
And let's turn that music on.

56
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,520
Advance the delivery sheath.

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,960
It's in the patient's heart, Dr. Murphy.

58
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,750
I think the music is a little distracting.

59
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,360
I feel the same way about operating without music.

60
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,010
I'll take a longer sheath,

61
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,580
and Dr. Murphy will need some forceps.

62
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,000

There is not enough room.

There's -- there's not enough room

without increasing abdominal pressure,

75
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,580

by the force induced by the pressure gradient.

80
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,910
And how do you calculate it?

81
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,080
I-I'd have to look it up.

Very good, Dr. Murphy.

That's also why this occluder won't work.

86
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,690
It won't hold up against the huge pressure gradient

- in her heart. - Is there a fix?

With no advance notice. Sorry about that.

99

But so great to meet you.

100
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,130
Jackson Han.

101
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,800
- Neil Melendez. - Oh, I know.

102
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,510
You did great work on that piggyback heart transplant.

103
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,780
I need a consult on Minesh Goyal.

104
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,990
He's the founding CEO of a company --

105
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,560
- What's his diagnosis? - He doesn't have one.

106
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,690
He's here for a full physical, complete diagnostic workup.

107
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,370
I have a long-standing Executive Wellness --

108
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,070
I'm a surgeon, not an internist.

109
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,840
I don't do preventative medicine.

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,160
No matter how rich the patient is.

111
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,990
You know what's great about rich patients?

112
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,950
They allow us to treat poor patients.

113
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,760
Also, I promised Minesh the very best.

114
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,380
So, really, who else am I gonna get?

115
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,090
Dr. Johansen to pre-op.

116
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,590
BP's 110 over 70.

117
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,990
Uh, Jackson -- Dr. Han --

118
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,310
says great things about you.

119
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,140
That's very kind.

120
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,080
Normal EKG, optimal BMI,

121
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,560
heart and lungs sound good.

122
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,330
Any reason you're worried enough about your health

123
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,280
to endure an entire day of tests?

124
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,610
I'm not worried.

125
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,240
Knowledge is power.

126
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,720
Whenever I enter a new market,

127
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,910
I learn everything I can about the landscape --

128
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,390
consumer needs, target market, competitors.

129
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,000
You're aware your body isn't a business.

130
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,600
I know I sound like a rich lunatic

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,760
with fantasies about controlling every aspect of my life.

132
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,430
And I guess I kind of am.

133
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,060
My dad was in good shape, too.

134
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,430
Until he dropped dead on his daily jog.

136
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:59,450
Dr. Markiel, please come to the mental health unit.

137
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,260
I'm Larry Childs.

138
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,180
I'd shake your hand, but, you know,

139
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,020
no functioning immune system.

140
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,020
- Aaron. Hi. - Good to meet you.

141
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,770
What flavor cancer do you have?

142
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,610
- What flavor? - Yeah.

143
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,190
Glioma.

144
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,820
Shut the front door.

145
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,400
Brain or spine?

146
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,860
- Brain. - Dude --

147
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,210
we're tumor twins.

148
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,280
Wh-What do they have you on?

149
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Vincristine. I hear that's intense.

150
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,290
My doc thought it would wipe me out.

151
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,060
You doing okay or longing for death?

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,340
I am hanging in there. Thank you.

153
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm on my third round of temozolomide.

154
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,520
I've seen you in here a few times.

155
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,410
I've seen you in here a few times.

156
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,190
You kind of keep to yourself, huh?

157
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,270
Yeah.

158
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,540
Well, I'm happy to introduce you around.

159
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,590
It's a really friendly group.

160
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,670
I'm okay. Thank you.

161
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,320
You have a support group you go to?

162
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,490
I do not.

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,700
Everyone needs a cancer community.

164
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,280
And try to hold still.

165
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,910
Thank you.

166
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,130
For bringing us in.

167
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,740
This is the new Chief's patient. It's a great opportunity.

168
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,160
Or it's a bunch of pointless tests.

169
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,880
Uh, for which I thank you.

170
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,210
Tell us about Dr. Han.

171
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,860
He's direct, charming,

172
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,360
very sure of himself.

173
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,550
Big ego.

174
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,970
There's nothing wrong with an ego if you can back it up.

175
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,030
And Dr. Han's arterial switch technique

176
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,980
is performed all over the world.

177
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,150
The tests aren't all pointless.

178
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,790
Way to stand firm, Park.

179
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,940
No, look at the monitor.

180
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,440
He has a tumor.

181
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,430
Percy's stable?

182
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,220
We're naming her Persephone.

183
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,450
Yes. I put in a central line for nutrition.

184
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,990
Percy is stable right now.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,310
We're looking for solutions to her problems.

186
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,650
W-wh-why does...

187
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,840
Why does she have all these birth defects?

188
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,740
Diane.

189
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,960
We spoke to our obstetrician.

190
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,450
She said these defects can happen for no reason, right?

191
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,470
That's true.

192
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,290
Over 50% have no known cause.

193
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,230
I was taking paroxetine for clinical depression.

194
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,480
And you went off the meds

195
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,110
as soon as you found out you were pregnant.

196
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,570
She was five, six weeks at most.

197
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,320
My OB told me studies show

198
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,820
antidepressants are safe to take during pregnancy.

199
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,240
But is that true,

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,930
or is she protecting me?

201
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,330
There was a study that associated paroxetine

202
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,960
with these kinds of defects.

203
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,940
It is a possibility.

204
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,930
You can't tell whether it's cancerous or benign?

205
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,430
Not until we do the biopsy,

206
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,210
which I've scheduled for later.

207
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,000
We'll know what's going on by the morning.

208
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,380
Good.

209
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,840
That's good.

210
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,570
Maybe you'd like to call someone?

211
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,310
A family member, a friend?

212
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,060
I'll worry when I know it's cancer.

213
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,300
We could use a transcatheter route

214
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,410
and patch each hole individually.

215
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,050
Her heart's the size of a walnut.

216
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,080
It's too small to maneuver inside.

217
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,930
A single large patch to close the holes

218
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,310
would withstand the pressure.

219
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,420
Yes.

220
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,770
It would also block electrical conduction,

221
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,670
causing deadly arrhythmias.

222
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,340
Dr. Murphy...

223
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,760
did you tell the mom that she caused her baby's birth defect?

224
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,810
No. I said that her antidepressants could have.

225
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,390
Why did you tell her that?

226
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,900
It's the truth.

227
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,860
And is that relevant to her current medical situation?

228
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,190
No.

229
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,660
And how did you think that answer would make her feel?

230
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,780
What did you think would happen?

231
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,370
The mother is devastated.

232
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,430
The father is furious.

233
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,710
I would be, too.

234
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,430
Shaun is a resident.

235
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,340
Residents make mistakes.

236
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,190
Managing these parents' emotional concerns

237
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,130
is as much a part of this job as operating on their daughter.

238
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,610
Social cues are hard for Shaun,

239
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,820
but we've been working with him --

240
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,910
You should be focused on your own shortcomings,

241
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,480
like retaining the formula for vascular impedance.

242
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,890
Dr. Han.

243
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,250
We could patch each individual hole in the heart

244
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,210
if we cut open the ventricle --

245
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,670
Don't change the subject, Dr. Murphy.

246
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,170
I didn't, Dr. Han.

247
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,630
We were talking about the baby.

248
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,370
Really?

249
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,260
You don't see a difference in the nature of your discussion

250
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,080
before I arrived and after?

251
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,630
We were talking about the baby.

252
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,860
They tried the approach you suggested at L.A. Children's.

253
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,550
The baby died a week later.

254
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,350
The suture line didn't hold, and the cardiac wall ruptured.

255
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,140
Keep looking.

256
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,480
Dr. Murphy,

257
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,860
do not talk with those parents again.

258
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,030
I'll walk with you.

259
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,620
You're pretty tough on my residents.

260
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,090
Rebuking them in public,

261
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,120
pimping them with questions during surgery.

262
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,290
Shame-based learning isn't my style.

263
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll bear that in mind.

264
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,100
But this isn't about my treatment of "the residents."

265
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,730
You're concerned about Dr. Murphy.

266
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,560
Well, a lot of doctors have less than ideal bedside manner.

267
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,190
- He's young. - Would you ever have said

268
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,230
something like that to a patient as a resident?

269
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,630
As a med student?

270
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,200
And Murphy doesn't even understand he did anything wrong.

271
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,780
Shaun has hard-wired differences

272
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,870
- in the way he perceives things. - Exactly.

273
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,030
No matter how hard he works,

274
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,770
no matter how hard you try and help him,

275
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,480
his limitations are not going to change.

276
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,960
He's going to continue to inflict them on our patients

277
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,570
all in the name of diversity and inclusion.

278
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,820
Shaun deserves to be here.

279
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,660
Once you see what he's capable of, you'll agree.

280
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:40,000
I look forward to being proven wrong.

281
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,230
Stay seated for 20 minutes.

282
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,560
Don't want you passing out in the lobby.

283
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,340
I know, I know. Thank you.

284
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,280
This disease changed my relationships,

285
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,350
changed my priorities, changed...

286
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,190
who I am.

287
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,790
Cancer is an identity.

288
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,250
Cancer is cellular mutation.

289
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,330
The people in this room are my people.

290
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,110
What are you? 20 years old? I'm triple your age.

291
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,840
I don't think you're my "people."

292
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,640
The last time I hung out with my law-school friends

293
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,630
epic fail.

294
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,630
The fact that you use the phrase "epic fail,"

295
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,930
kind of case in point.

296
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,970
They're all focused on what firm they're gonna land at,

297
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,790
and I'm all about whether...

298
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,100
Candice's leukemia is responding

299
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,640
to her new chemo regimen.

300
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,060
By the way, she has this peppermint oil

301
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,710
that is great for headaches.

302
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,180
I know that look.

303
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,890
Here, here.

304
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,270
Got you, brother...

305
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,600
whether you like it or not.

306
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,940
Show me where we are.

307
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,530
That angle runs pretty close to the sacral nerve roots.

308
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,280
How are we doing?

309
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,050
Tumor's abutting the iliac artery.

310
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,590
I'm trying not to disrupt the entire blood supply

311
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,930
to his lower body.

312
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,720
Dr. Han, I'm Morgan Reznick.

313
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,100
I really enjoyed your article on Myotomy

314
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,840
for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

315
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,670
I appreciate the thorough research behind your sucking up.

316
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,260
And you are?

317
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,880
Alex Park.

318
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,350
Park, you were a cop.

319
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,930
Medicine as a second career, good stuff.

320
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,180
Tends to bring a fresh perspective.

321
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,400
I hit an artery. Take the needle.

322
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,910
Blood's pooling in the pelvis.

323
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,210
- Should we open him up? - No.

324
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,040
Prep the femoral artery. Get me an art cath set.

325
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,920
Presure is dropping.

326
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,820
Platinum coil.

327
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,580
Nice save.

328
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,080
Next time, don't hit the vessel.

329
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,420
There is no next time.

330
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,460
The biopsy's too dangerous.

331
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,010
It is likely that it's a benign notochord cell tumor.

332
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,490
They look like chordomas,

333
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,160
but they're harmless and way more common.

334
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,660
But you don't know.

335
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,270
Since we can't do the biopsy, no.

336
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,610
This is the problem with broad testing.

337
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,040
Everyone has abnormalities.

338
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,360
Most of them are nothing.

339
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,860
But when we do find them,

340
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,110
we have to make some tough choices.

341
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,450
So, what exactly is my tough choice?

342
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,890
We could remove the tumor.

343
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,510
This is a very risky surgery.

344
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,600
There's a chance of paralysis or worse,

345
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,170
you may not make it off the table.

346
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,250
Or you do nothing.

347
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,730
We'd continue to monitor it,

348
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,320
do imaging every few weeks.

349
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,150
But chordomas move very quickly.

350
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,400
By the time any change showed up on imaging,

351
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,810
it's most likely metastasized throughout your body.

352
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,310
So it probably isn't cancer,

353
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,980
but if it is and I wait, then I'll die.

354
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,150
That's true.

355
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:58,070
And if I don't wait and I get the surgery,

356
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,990
then there's a good chance I'll die.

357
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,070
Yes.

358
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,750
I'm gonna need to think this over.

359
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,820
This is the May Annals of Neonatal Surgery.

360
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,980
I just finished March. I need to read April now.

361
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,910
Oh, I have April, Shaun.

362
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,560
No.

363
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,330
No, you're supposed to be reading

364
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,880
New Approaches in Neonatal Surgery.

365
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,610
Claire has the British Journal of Neonatology.

366
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,250
Shaun...

367
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,670
I think maybe you should be quiet around Han for a little while.

368
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,470
But then how will I answer his questions?

369
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,930
Direct questions, absolutely answer.

370
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,530
Otherwise, outside of the O.R.,

371
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,140
you should stay out of his way.

372
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,870
If someone had convinced Shaun to do that with Dr. Melendez,

373
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,980
he would still be on suction.

374
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,030
Code blue. NICU, Bed 4.

375
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,870
O2 SATs dropped and central venous pressure shot up.

376
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,680
The Pulmonary Artery Band is failing.

377
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
- Eight of dopamine. - Let's get a mask on her.

378
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,960
She won't last much longer. We need other options.

379
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,340
I'll update the parents.

380
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,300
Let's get her on full cardiac support.

381
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,150
What have you got? Anything?

382
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,130
This Cleveland group

383
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,840
repaired a bowel protrusion using enterolysis.

384
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,340
I could cut out this excess inflammatory tissue

385
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,840
and segment of bowel atresia.

386
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,880
Might make her intestines small enough to fit.

387
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,830
Promising.

388
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,600
Given the size of her abdomen,

389
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,010
I need to remove a lot of bowel.

390
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,630
There's a good chance she wouldn't be able to absorb food.

391
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,390
We'll have to find the right balance.

392
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,800
It's our only workable plan.

393
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,400
Best bet on the heart is to cut through the ventricle,

394
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,840
like Murphy suggested.

395
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,220
you were concerned about the suture line holding.

396
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,470
Well, I still am.

397
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,990
Hopefully, horizontal mattress sutures will work.

398
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,350
They should be able to withstand the tension at the suture line.

399
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,200
There's still a risk of an aneurysm forming

400
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,060
in the tissue underneath.

402
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,190
Dr. Lim?

403
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,240
I have an idea I'd like to share,

404
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,910
even though Dr. Han didn't ask me a question.

405
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,660
Yeah, go ahead, Shaun.

406
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,060
If we go in through the atrium,

407
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,890
we wouldn't have to worry about the suture line...

408
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,960
It's the same issue we discussed.

409
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,810
There's not enough room inside the baby's heart

410
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,270
to stitch the patches in the place.

411
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,670
Oh, we don't need to, Dr. Han.

412
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,730
We can make a plug

413
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,440
small enough for her heart...

414
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,740
a PTFE disc with a stem like a mushroom.

415
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,570
Then we can insert the stem through one of the holes

416
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,200
until the disc presses against the wall,

417
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,560
covering all the holes.

418
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,440
L-like a stopper in a bathtub.

419
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,660
Yes.

420
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,790
The higher pressure on the left side of her heart

421
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,210
would keep it in place.

422
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,950
We wouldn't even need to stitch.

423
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,870
Great idea.

424
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,050
We should take this to the parents.

425
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,740
Great idea for the heart.

426
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,510
But we need to tell them that our current plan

427
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,930
for the abdominal repair

428
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,920
is considerably more of a long shot.

429
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,500
And that fixing the heart takes an option off the table.

430
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,960
Withdrawing care.

431
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,430
You can't move that card.

432
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,390
Excuse me?

433
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,620
Who cheats at solitaire?

434
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,330
You're literally only cheating yourself.

435
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,270
Again.

436
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,870
Good morning, Larry.

437
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,320
Is it a macho thing?

438
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,710
Like a real man should be able to make it through

439
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,280
without leaning on a label or the people who go with it?

440
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,340
Embracing cancer as an identity

441
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,510
is the last thing any one of us should be doing.

442
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,790
It underscores everything horrible right now.

443
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,520
We're in a daily battle for our lives.

444
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,710
I see no value in dwelling on that.

445
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,300
Candice is late.

446
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,470
Which means either her niece forgot to pick her up.

447
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,180
Again.

448
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,520
Or she got some bad news.

449
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,230
Or she's already dead.

450
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,230
We are in a daily battle.

451
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,990
I'd rather have some company.

452
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,480
I spoke to my mother and brother,

453
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,800
and they both think I shouldn't do the surgery.

454
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,440
Apparently they're more scared of your surgical skills

455
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,010
than they are of this tumor.

456
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,720
And where do you stand?

457
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,350
I need numbers.

458
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,690
Please.

459
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,650
The stats on something like this, it --

460
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,710
there are a lot of variables.

461
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,200
What are the odds I make it through the surgery

462
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,280
without any complications?

463
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,910
It's a challenging procedure.

464
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,910
Zero complications, I'd say 80%.

465
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,250
But it is very unlikely this tumor is malignant.

466
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:46,840
Give me a number.

467
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,760
About 5% chance it's a chordoma.

468
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,020
The numbers agree with your family.

469
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,220
So do I.

470
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,320
I've always been more comfortable with action than inaction.

471
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,080
I want you to do the surgery.

472
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,660
Certainty comes at a price.

473
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,360
She'll be able to get off the life support machines?

474
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,260
If everything goes well, yes.

475
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,760
She'll have a strong heart.

476
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,600
How soon can you do it?

477
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,240
You should know we feel less confident

478
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,100
about our plan for her bowel.

479
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,330
The chance of failure is quite high.

480
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,230
How high?

481
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,950
I put it at 90% that the repair won't work.

482
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,700
Which would lead to irreversible malnutrition.

483
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,200
Your daughter would slowly starve to death over months.

484
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,300
Right now, her body is working very hard

485
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,910
just to stay alive.

486
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,000
If we were to turn off the machines...

487
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,050
Turn off the machines?

488
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,640
She would pass quickly. And peacefully.

489
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:21,680
If the heart surgery is a success,

490
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,180
that won't be an option.

491
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,790
Why not try to fix the bowel first

492
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:28,900
to see if it works?

493
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,750
We won't know if the bowel is viable

494
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,440
until after the heart is.

495
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,610
We have to do the surgery.

496
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,550
But if this doesn't work, she could starve to death.

497
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,800
It's worth the risk...

498
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,450
It's not our risk. It's hers.

499
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,290
So, instead, you're ready to give up on our daughter?

500
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,460
I mean, it's like we're right back at the ultrasound.

501
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,060
We decided together to continue this pregnancy.

502
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,100
So this is as much my fault as it is yours.

503
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,130
My fault?

504
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,090
Because of the medication?

505
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,090
I cannot turn off that machine.

506
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,780
Your guilt is stopping you from admitting what we need to do.

507
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,430
My guilt has nothing to do with this.

508
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,730
- I am fighting for my daughter. - So am I.

509
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,660
Since the parents can't agree, the decision

510
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,360
about the baby's care will be made by a judge

511
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,110
who will rely on our recommendation.

512
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,760
So we make the choice,

513
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,990
but the parents live with it?

514
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,990
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

515
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,970
For parents to have to decide between

516
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,790
letting their daughter die

517
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,750
or fighting for her life, knowing she may suffer horribly,

518
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,840
maybe it's better if we carry that burden.

519
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,890
Dr. Lim?

520
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,760
Your decision would be?

521
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,970
Take her off life support.

522
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,160
The odds are stacked against the bowel repair working.

523
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,120
Those numbers reflect the general population of doctors.

524
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,520
I think Dr. Lim and I are better than that.

525
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,480
We can beat the odds.

526
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,800
One of the things I'm not going to miss

527
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,870
about being Chief of Surgery

528
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,410
is being responsible for choices like this.

529
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,810
Dr. Han, it's your department --

530
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,960
it's your call.

531
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,220
You've been here all night?

532
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,780
I've been working on a case

533
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,310
with the new Chief of Surgery, Dr. Han.

534
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,790
- How's that going? - Not very well.

535
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,790
He plays music in the operating room.

536
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,160
Oh, geez. One of those.

537
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,540
And he says I need to focus on

538
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,570
our patients' emotional needs.

539
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,150
Well, that's a tough assignment for you.

540
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,510
You ever wish you had, you know,

541
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,670
friends, co-workers on the spectrum?

542
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,090
Not usually.

543
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,980
But maybe Dr. Han wouldn't notice me as much

544
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,340
if I weren't the only doctor with ASD.

545
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,650
There's this kid in chemo,

546
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,740
just obsessed with having cancer.

547
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,780
It's all he talks about.

548
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,410
He wants to be friends with everybody in the ward.

549
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,200
That's very smart of him.

550
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,330
Speigel et al showed an increase in overall survival

551
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:21,670
and quality of life measures in breast cancer patients

552
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,740
who formed social bonds with others battling the disease.

553
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,570
What should I do about Dr. Han?

554
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,700
I don't know.

555
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,790
just do your work,

556
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,930
be a good surgeon, be an excellent surgeon.

557
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,020
Over time, he'll forget about the autism.

558
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,350
Why would that happen?

559
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,610
He'll see that you have the skill, you have dedication.

560
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,630
I have autism.

561
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,430
It's part of who I am.

562
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,310
The judge...?

563
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,460
Accepted our recommendation

564
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,360
and ruled in favor of surgery.

565
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,280
Thank you, Doctor.

566
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,740
Okay, Percy.

567
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,250
Momma loves you.

568
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,420
I love you, Percy.

569
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,080
Should we remove more bowel?

570
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,430
That would take us to the ilium.

571
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,540
She won't gain enough weight to thrive.

572
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,440
Her abdominal muscles are tight

573
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,300
from developing around an empty cavity.

576
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,720
They're cinched around her tummy like a corset.

577
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,320
What if we unbuttoned it?

578
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,360
Released the muscle

579
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,320
and increased the abdominal circumference.

580
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,650
Those muscles are part of her abdominal wall.

581
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,450
Not if we separate the layers --

582
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,770
create a plane between the skin and the muscle.

583
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,070
You good if Murphy and I start on the heart?

584
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,900
Dr. Browne, you're with me on the abdomen.

585
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,070
Clearing the field.

586
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,970
Han is on the call schedule next weekend.

587
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,180
Maybe Carmen will switch with me so I can cover with him?

588
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,470
Or maybe you shouldn't try so hard.

589
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,660
Retractor.

590
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,850
Some of us don't have a cool former career --

591
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,480
or an easy-going, mellow demeanor.

592
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,730
People are never gonna crowd in my corner

593
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,190
because I'm just so likable.

594
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,980
Well, you could try being nice to them.

595
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,840
- Well, this is easier. - There it is.

596
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:55,010
Does it look like cancer?

597
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,720
It's not labeled.

598
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,060
We're all gonna have to wait for the pathologist's report.

599
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,060
Probe.

600
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,320
The artery is in the way.

601
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,490
We can't get at the tumor without him bleeding out.

602
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:18,240
We're gonna have to take it from the back.

603
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,870
- But the S1 nerve root -- - Is something he can live without.

Let's take her off cardiac support.

615
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,460
Dr. Murphy, it was your idea.

616
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,490
You do the honors.

617
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,290
Abdominal pressure is normal.

618
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,710
The intestines are perfusing.

619
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,530
Pulmonary pressure's spiking.

620
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,990
Prostacyclin and nitric oxide --

621
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,070
we need to get her lung pressure down.

622
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,570
Oxygen SATs are dropping.

623
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,820
No response to pulmonary vasodilators.

624
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,430
Now the heart's too strong. It's overpowering her lungs.

625
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,310
She needs to go back on cardiac support.

626
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,950
Persephone won't starve to death...

627
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,370
but she will drown in her own fluids.

628
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,340
I'll talk to the parents.

629
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,430
May I come?

630
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,830
Now that Persephone's heart is pumping at full power,

631
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,690
her lungs are overwhelmed.

632
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,960
The humane thing to do

633
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,740
is to turn off the machines and let her go.

634
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,240
No, I-I can't...

635
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,700
I can't give up on her.

636
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,210
Because you fought for her

637
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,630
every minute since she was born.

638
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,310
Before that, when you were taking your medication

639
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,190
for the depression,

640
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,130
you were fighting to keep going

641
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,470
so you could bring her into the world.

642
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,860
But letting go of Percy is not giving up on her.

643
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,700
It's listening to what her body is telling us.

644
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,750
She's hit her limit.

645
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,980
Okay.

646
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,030
I want Persephone to look as good as possible

647
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,270
for the parents.

648
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,310
Let's turn off cardiac support.

649
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,610
Ventilator.

650
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,910
Let's take a minute.

653
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,080
Check valve.

654
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,890
Every time the heart contracted,

655
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,270
blood went into the opposite side of the heart

656
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,150
and raised lung pressure.

657
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,770
The hole reduced the pressure when it got too high

658
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,270
because it allowed backflow.

659
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,300
But our repair of the defect blocked this backwards flow.

660
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,990
What if we made it so she still had a heart defect,

661
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,560
but only when she needed it?

662
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,440
It'd be like an unlatched door in the wall of the heart.

663
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,250
When the pressure gets too high on the right side,

664
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,900
the door swings open, releasing the pressure on the lungs.

665
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,820
The rest of the time, it stays shut.

666
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,920
It should reduce lung pressure by a third. Is that enough?

667
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
It depends on how high

668
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,990
her pulmonary vascular resistance is.

669
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,300
PVR is pulmonary artery pressure

670
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,160
minus wedge pressure divided by cardiac output times 80.

671
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,110
The last time I saw my doctor,

672
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,260
he told me I had six months to live.

673
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,860
He also told me I should marry an accountant

674
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,990
and move to North Dakota.

675
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,430
You don't say.

676
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,750
When I asked if it would help my cancer,

677
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,410
he said no,

678
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,230
just make the six months seem much longer.

679
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,400
What's the difference between a Neo-Nazi and cancer?

680
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,780
Cancer doesn't discriminate.

681
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,410
I knew a guy once --

682
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,180
his Zodiac sign was Cancer.

683
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,290
It was really ironic how he died.

684
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,350
how's that?

685
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,550
He was eaten by a giant crab.

686
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:47,090
Oh, geez.

687
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,390
Aaron, glioma.

688
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,680
Candice, leukemia.

689
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,740
Gin rummy or blackjack?

690
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,480
How fast do you want to take my money?

691
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,890
Blackjack.

692
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,190
Cut 'em.

693
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,870
Did you get it all?

694
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:18,790
Yes.

695
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,710
Totally clear margins.

696
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,640
But the only way to achieve that

697
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,250
involved removing the nerve that controls your left foot.

698
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,880
Rehab and an advanced orthotic may help,

699
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,180
but you will walk with a limp.

700
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:35,390
Final pathology will let us know if it was worth it.

701
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,940
I'll let you know when it comes in.

702
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,020
It doesn't matter anymore.

703
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,860
It's not like you can put the tumor back in.

704
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,550
Is she... okay?

705
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,840
She still has a surgery or two in her future, but, yes.

706
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,100
She's gonna be great.

707
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,480
Can I hold her?

708
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,520
I think that would be very nice.

709
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,610
For both of you.

710
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,870
Hi, angel.

711
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,090
Oh, my baby.

712
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,880
Come hold her.

713
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,600
You were fighting for her, too.

714
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,900
She's beautiful.

715
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:17,240
Nice work.

716
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:19,830
Thank you.

717
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,210
She's beautiful.

718
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,790
Listen to her.

719
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,260
Thank you.

720
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,690
Minesh's biopsy results?

721
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,670
You don't want to know if we wasted our time

722
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,740
almost killing him?

723
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,410
Can't put the tumor back.

724
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,470
Hello, Dr. Han.

725
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,390
You take the bus, too?

726
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,810
No, Shaun.

727
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,940
I just wanted to talk to you.

728
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,030
You really do have remarkable diagnostic skills.

729
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,490
I have to admit, you're an asset to this hospital.

730
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,610
Yes, I am.

731
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,370
I spoke to the Residency Director of Pathology.

732
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,370
And we both agree you'll be a great fit there.

733
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,340
I'm a surgical resident.

734
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,420
As a pathology resident,

735
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,110
you'll touch cases and lives

736
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,680
across all the medical departments.

737
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,780
It's an opportunity for you to help patients

738
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,480
without having to deal with patients.

739
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,790
Given your difficulties with communication and social cues,

740
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,820
I think it will be a much better fit.

741
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,530
No, thank you.

742
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,630
I have been working very hard

743
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,080
at my communication skills.

744
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:26,620
Hard work isn't enough.

745
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,620
You have to do the job.

746
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,420
I am a surgical resident.

747
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,380
You were.
