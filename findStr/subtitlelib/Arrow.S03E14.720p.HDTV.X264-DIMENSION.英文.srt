7
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,720
Previously, on "Arrow"...

8
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,450
You've heard of Votura?

9
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,380
Keeping the subject extremely susceptible to suggestion,

10
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,540
or retaining no memory of their actions.

11
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,500
- I will tell Ra's-- - He will still kill her.

12
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,760
She fired the arrow.

13
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,240
The bio weapon is comprised of two components.

14
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,230
The Omega she has is harmless without its counterpart, Alpha.

15
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,820
I trust my father. He explained to me that every name

16
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,850
on that list has a reason to be there.

17
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,120
A few years ago, I found a message he left me,

18
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,540
explaining the list.

19
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,850
How was that possible? You were on a deserted island!

20
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:30,010
I didn't say that I found it on the island.

21
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,610
Chien Na Wei has left Hong Kong.

22
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,860
We've tracked her here.

23
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,340
Where are we--

24
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,820
Welcome home, Mr. Queen.

26
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,170
Did you learn all this in nine months?

27
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,440
Malcolm's a good teacher.

28
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,250
Did he teach you to cheat?

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,740
There's no such thing.

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,050
There's only survival and death.

31
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,480
He's not wrong.

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:20,990
This is good.

33
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,140
What is it?

34
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,240
If I told you what it was,

35
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,610
you probably wouldn't eat it.

36
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,380
Is it weird?

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,920
You know, being back here with me?

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,570
Well, I've been back here before.

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,650
You know, in a lot of ways,

40
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,640
this place reminds me of who I am.

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,210
Or, I guess... who I've become.

42
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,780
It's probably why Malcolm

43
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,110
suggested we train here.

44
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,970
It's kind of cool that we're here, though.

45
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,330
It's like there's really

46
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,330
no more secrets between us anymore.

47
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:52,700
Yeah.

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,820
When you were here...

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,920
Did you ever think you were going to see us again?

50
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,480
Get home again?

51
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,510
Chien Na Wei touched ground in Starling 24 hours ago.

52
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,600
We're still trying to determine how she made it

53
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,360
into the country, but we believe she's here

54
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,280
to auction off the Omega bio weapon

55
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,230
to the highest bidder.

56
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,840
The Omega's inert without its counterpart.

57
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,850
Who's going to pay for a useless super virus?

58
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,050
Rogue nations. Terrorist groups who believe

59
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,600
they can replicate the alpha component on their own.

60
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,180
Why did she have to sell it here?

61
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,020
There's a corporate executive in town.

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
A man on the Triad's payroll.

63
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,350
He's committed several acts of industrial espionage

64
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,740
for them over the years.

65
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,660
His name is Peter Kang.

66
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,900
Yeah, I know him.

67
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,190
He works at my family's company.

68
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,020
That guy came to my house for Christmas.

69
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,840
And, that, Mr. Queen, is exactly why

70
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,390
you and Mr. Yamashiro are still alive.

71
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,190
Chien Na Wei chose the one place on this earth

72
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,780
where you're still of use to me and my superior.

73
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,350
But have no illusions--

74
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,140
If you threaten to compromise the mission

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,790
by contacting anyone in Starling City,

76
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,780
I will remove you and Mr. Yamashiro from the equation,

77
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,480
along with anyone who discovers Oliver Queen is still alive.

78
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,620
Tracker's in place.

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,510
Now what?

80
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,460
Follow Kang to Chien Na Wei?

81
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,320
No, she's too smart

82
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,650
to keep the Omega on her person.

83
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,940
She'll keep it in a secure location till the auction.

84
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,450
We'll need to figure out

85
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,910
where that auction's going to be.

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,780
Kang's on the move.

87
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,600
Laurel. Hey.

88
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,980
What you having, sweetheart? Next round's on me.

89
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,320
Your desk sergeant called,

90
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,250
wondering why you weren't on duty.

91
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,850
Yeah. Ah, well, this is Laurel.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,430
You know, the daughter that lived.

93
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,230
Is there a bartender in the city

94
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,590
that doesn't already know that?

95
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,480
Well, excuse me for seeking a sympathetic ear.

96
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,630
Takes more than some fancy corporate law firm job

97
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,890
for some of us to get over Sara's death.

98
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,740
I love you, so I'm going to pretend like you didn't say that,

99
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,190
and I'm going to drive you home.

100
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,030
Not now, sweetie. Not now. No, please.

101
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,170
Hit me again, Frank.

102
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,110
Later, Frank.

103
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,090
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

104
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,320
Kang's headed inside.

105
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,170
A.R.G.U.S. has detected bursts of data emanating

106
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,610
from Kang's office computer.

107
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,010
But it's protected by Shacal-4 encryption.

108
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,880
Ok, pretend for a second like I don't know what that is.

109
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,400
It means we can't hack into Kang's computer.

110
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,160
You'll need to get directly on to the Queen Consolidated network.

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,230
Maseo, Waller was pretty clear

112
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,140
what would happen to people

113
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,690
if they found out I'm still alive.

114
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,330
So taking a stroll through my family's company

115
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,790
is probably not the best plan.

116
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,630
You'll go in at night. I don't have time to familiarize myself

117
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,140
with the office floor plans.

118
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,950
Oh, my God.

119
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,700
Who is that?

120
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
That's my sister.

121
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,350
Sara...

122
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,320
Sara...

123
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,760
- Are you ok? - Yeah, why?

124
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,570
You kept saying Sara's name.

125
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,380
Yeah, well, I was dreaming.

126
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,860
Why didn't you tell me?

127
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:13,770
What?

128
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,430
That Sara died?

129
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,720
Laurel told me.

130
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,530
Kind of by accident, but...

131
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,110
Well, I didn't want to upset you,

132
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,090
and Laurel didn't want

133
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
- anyone to know. - Why?

134
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,050
After everything that happened with Slade,

135
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,610
Sara went back to the League of Assassins.

136
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,460
She had her own secrets, Thea.

137
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,100
And...

138
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,160
those weren't my secrets to share.

139
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,210
Was it the League that killed her?

140
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,640
Where are you going?

141
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,760
I'm going to...

142
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,910
take a walk, clear my head.

143
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,120
Slade.

144
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,620
I told myself I wasn't going to come down here.

145
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,030
That I never needed to see you again.

146
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,330
You'll be happy to know I was wrong.

147
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,190
You think I won't get out of here?

148
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:07,980
You think I won't kill those you care for?

149
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,920
Well, I keep my promises, kid.

150
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,280
I keep my promises!

152
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,120
The fire went out. Ollie, what is it?

153
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,980
We need to get off the island. We're in danger.

154
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,290
What are you talking about?

155
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,700
Slade Wilson's here.

156
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,820
Ollie, that is ridiculous.

157
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,300
It's not. Listen to me.

158
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,550
Slade was--

159
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,080
I was keeping him prisoner here!

160
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,940
What do you mean, "Was?"

161
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,690
Hello, Oliver.

162
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,750
You let him out!

163
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,240
You told me you lost your duel with Ra's

164
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,050
despite your willingness to kill him

165
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,140
because you hesitated.

166
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,000
For you and Thea and even myself

167
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,380
to have any hope of surviving the next encounter,

168
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,570
you need to regain that killer instinct

169
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,620
born of a primal need to survive.

170
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,710
You're sick.

171
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,510
Your sat phone is going to stop working

172
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,590
after this call.

173
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,840
Ollie!

174
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,320
Merlyn set Slade loose as an object lesson.

175
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,890
That's insane!

176
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,060
He thinks it'll help me regain my killer instinct.

177
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,670
If he doesn't kill us first!

178
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,590
Come on.

179
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,150
The last time I saw her, she was in pigtails.

180
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,280
Where is she going?

181
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,450
Hi, Ollie. Dad.

182
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,190
Stopped by the office today.

183
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,140
Saw mom talking to Walter.

184
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,320
Starting to think that something's happening there.

185
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,840
But I don't know...

186
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,560
Queenie.

187
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,260
Your sister's boyfriend?

188
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,320
I-I don't know.

189
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,460
You got my delivery?

190
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,580
You have some of that inheritance of yours?

191
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,720
What the hell is this?

192
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,940
What are you doing here, Tommy?

193
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,530
About to ask Jordan the same thing.

194
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,330
Just paying the family my respects.

195
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,580
Yeah, and so you did.

196
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,800
Now you're going to stay away from her permanently.

197
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,180
Whatever.

198
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,610
You should be bringing flowers here,

199
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,230
not looking to score drugs!

200
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,290
What are you even doing here, Tommy?

201
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,150
I came to thank you for my birthday card.

202
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,240
And to tell you that

203
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,690
my party tonight's 21 and over.

204
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,820
Well, I think we both know that that's not true.

205
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,440
Oh, it is. As far as you're concerned.

206
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,150
You shouldn't grow up too fast.

207
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,920
Yeah, well, you're not my brother.

208
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,560
You're right, no, I'm not.

209
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,560
But I think about him every single day.

210
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,600
For the first time, I'm glad he's gone.

211
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,340
Cause seeing you like this would break his heart.

212
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,500
It's funny how Ollie seems to care more about me

213
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,850
now that he's dead than he did when he was alive.

216
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,080
Every time I spoke to his grave,

217
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,660
it always felt so empty.

218
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,250
That's 'cause he was here watching over you.

219
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,030
Why did you bring me here?

220
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,230
To get something we need.

221
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,290
- I thought you were better with a bow. - I am.

222
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,470
It's for you. Just in case.

223
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,990
What is it?

224
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,630
He's been here.

225
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,590
Nice to see you again...

226
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,210
Ms. Queen.

227
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,620
You OK?

228
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,020
Yeah.

229
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,750
She's unhurt.

230
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,750
I have no desire to kill either of you.

231
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,160
This time tomorrow, two bodies will be found in Starling City,

232
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,610
burned beyond any recognition.

233
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,510
With ample evidence that Oliver and Thea Queen

234
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,820
have been killed in some horrible accident.

235
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,220
I'm going to leave you, kid, the same way you left me.

236
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,480
Alone in Purgatory.

237
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,200
You leave me, and you let my sister go.

238
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,540
You're lucky I didn't bury her next to Shado.

239
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,680
Did he tell you about her?

240
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,970
Shado...

241
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,150
is the reason why this is all happening.

242
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,450
Why I killed your mother.

243
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:18,640
He doesn't need to. I figured out

244
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,310
you're a sick son of a bitch all on my own.

245
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,870
Well, of course he didn't tell you.

246
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,240
Your brother likes his secrets.

247
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,450
You always have.

248
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,560
That's who you are.

249
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,950
You know, maybe if you told me what really happened with Shado,

250
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,630
your mother would still be alive.

251
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,430
- That's enough! - I agree!

252
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,600
Welcome home, kid.

253
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,000
Slade...

254
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,920
Slade...

255
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,440
Slade!

256
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,390
Are you in position?

257
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,740
Yeah.

258
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,710
The company computers are protected by biometric encryption.

259
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,740
Look for a fingerprint reader.

260
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,720
Ok, but why wouldn't they take me out of the directory?

261
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,830
Why would they? You're dead.

262
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,790
Yeah. I'm in.

263
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,700
The crawler's programmed

264
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,190
to seek out all of Kang's network traffic.

265
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,130
And it's running.

266
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,920
The program should take 90 seconds.

267
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,920
What's that?

268
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,700
Oliver, you have to go.

269
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,790
I'm not done.

270
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,440
You have to go. Someone's coming.

271
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,650
You're cute.

272
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,280
It's too bad you're, you know, dead.

273
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,680
Which is obviously a lot worse for you than it is for me.

274
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,160
I really need to learn

275
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,930
to stop talking to myself.

276
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,490
According to the information we took off Kang's computer,

277
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,890
the auction is tonight.

278
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,180
- In four hours. - Where?

279
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,560
They're still working on that.

280
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,560
The crawler program

281
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,730
retrieved 2.7 gigabytes of data.

282
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,430
It's taking some time to crawl through.

283
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,530
You have less than four hours, apparently.

284
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:45,950
Where's Queen?

285
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,520
Probably went to check on our weapons.

286
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,900
Thanks, bud.

287
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,360
Yeah, no problem.

288
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,290
Bud.

289
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,550
Nothing like a rich kid's party

290
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,960
to remind me of what I miss about being shot at in Afghanistan.

291
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,400
When I hooked up my big brother with his first stateside job,

292
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,270
I somehow expected more gratitude and less complaining.

293
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,690
Oh, less complaining. You sound like Lyla.

294
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,090
You should have never divorced her.

295
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,240
You big dummy.

296
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,570
Thank you, Andy, I appreciate that.

297
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,660
Do you like sushi?

298
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,760
Have you ever had anyone eat some off of you?

299
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,180
I promise not to use chopsticks.

300
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,950
Are you still using that line?

301
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,270
Well, it looks like I scared her off.

302
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,440
Oh, that's all right, she's vegan, anyway.

303
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,600
What are you doing here?

304
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,870
I heard you decided to go corporate in San Francisco

305
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,790
instead of saving the world in Starling City.

306
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:15,440
I realized that maybe the world can't be saved.

307
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,170
What is it?

308
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,860
I just don't believe who's here.

309
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,860
Queen.

310
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,130
I thought I told you this party is 21 and over.

311
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,550
No worries. I came prepared.

312
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,620
Fake ID.

313
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,060
Laurel, how are you?

314
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm handling. How's school?

315
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,460
Straight "A" student.

316
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,660
I'm going to go grab a drink.

317
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,430
Not alcoholic, I swear.

318
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,920
Queenie.

319
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,010
Isn't this past your bedtime?

320
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,420
Maybe I just need a little something to keep me awake.

321
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,240
You holding?

322
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,530
Stay away from Thea Queen.

323
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,820
Who the hell do you think...

324
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,690
Holy crap.

325
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,750
You're Oliver Queen. You're supposed to be dead.

326
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,330
People are going to believe--

327
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,210
Stay away from my sister.

328
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,510
How'd you like to be dead again?

329
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,820
How many people are in this prison?

330
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,650
I mean, maybe there's somebody we can call for help?

331
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,160
Well, Slade killed the guard.

332
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,650
There's one other inmate.

333
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,530
He's not going to be helpful.

334
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,690
Then how are we supposed to get out of here?

335
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,290
This is a Chinese prison

336
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,310
retrofitted by eight A.R.G.U.S. Technicians.

337
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,780
There is no getting out of here.

338
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,900
So what, we're just supposed to sit here and starve to death?

339
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,150
That's your plan?

340
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,620
I am working on a plan.

341
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,710
- What did he mean? - What?

342
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,770
Wilson. When he said that you were still hiding something.

343
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,670
He's insane.

344
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,620
Yeah, I picked up on that. I also picked up on how

345
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,990
you reacted when he said

346
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,490
that you were keeping secrets from me.

347
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,050
Was he telling the truth?

348
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,900
I don't think that this is the right time.

349
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,820
Actually, I think time is

350
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,970
something that we have a lot of right now.

351
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,120
Why didn't you tell me about Sara?

352
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,750
Come on, Thea--

353
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,740
No, now that I know

354
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,560
about your secret, everything has become a whole lot clearer.

355
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,570
And I can tell when you're hiding something from me.

356
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,820
Like you are doing right now.

357
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,030
So what is it going to take for you to stop treating me

358
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,910
like this tiny, fragile, little object?

359
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,090
Tiny?

360
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,260
What?

361
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,290
This prison, these...

362
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,170
cells,

363
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,740
they were made for men.

364
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,070
Fully grown men.

365
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,800
Come here.

366
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,060
I never thought I would wish for longer arms.

367
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,950
There's a way that we can do it.

368
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,270
But it's going to hurt.

369
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,610
Just do it.

370
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,930
All good. On three.

371
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,680
1, 2
1, 2...

372
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,640
3.

373
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:49,640
Are you OK? -Oh, yeah.

374
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,830
All right. Come on.

375
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,970
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

376
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:21,830
Ok.

377
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,240
That's good.

378
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,840
Come here, come here. All right.

379
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,660
Malcolm would have told Slade

380
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,250
about the plane we used to get here.

381
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,290
It's how he plans to get back to Starling.

382
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,260
Anybody see who Peter Pan'd him?

383
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,600
Well, a few witnesses saw someone

384
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,540
head upstairs a few minutes before it happened.

385
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,070
Male, white or hispanic,

386
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,220
twenties or thirties.

387
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,980
That narrows it down.

388
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,800
Maybe it's a vigilante doing some public service.

389
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,330
Sure.

390
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,980
Thea, right?

391
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,590
Yeah.

392
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,070
Aren't you a little young to be at a party like this?

393
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,150
I invited her.

394
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,520
Oh, well, you spoiled billionaires

395
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,480
sure know how to throw yourselves a party.

396
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,770
You got underaged girls, you got drug dealers,

397
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,050
you even have dead drug dealers.

398
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,620
If I had have known he was here,

399
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,350
he never would have made it past the front gate.

400
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,890
We had a lot of crashers here tonight.

401
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,010
Yeah, right. I can see that. What are you doing here?

402
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,080
They asked us to stay and give statements.

403
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,040
No, I mean, at this douchebag's party.

404
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,020
- Tommy, I'm s-orry-- - Wow, you really have

405
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,040
a thing for these rich bad boys, don't you?

406
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,820
I mean, you think maybe, just maybe,

407
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,240
one of them gotten your sister killed

408
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,590
- would have gotten you cured of that. - Dad!

409
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,810
And what about you, sweetheart?

410
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,890
Dressed like that. It's funny;

411
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,390
I can't figure out if you're following in

412
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,160
your brother's footsteps or my dead daughter.

413
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,660
Dad, you know what--

414
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,990
I'm just observing how one little boat trip

415
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,910
can turn everyone's life to crap.

416
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,180
That is enough!

417
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,210
You are not doing this here.

418
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,080
We're leaving.

419
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,320
Right now.

420
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:03,730
Well, thank you for that.

421
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,300
I'm sorry, was I embarrassing you?

422
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,460
No. Yourself.

423
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,840
At least I know who I am.

424
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,660
And I'm not becoming someone I'm not.

425
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,190
Hanging around with billionaire playboys

426
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,740
like some kind of gold digger?

427
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,210
Taking on a sell out job in San Francisco.

428
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,040
Is that what this is about?

429
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,720
When Sara died, you said you wanted to go to law school

430
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,640
cause you wanted to make the world a better place.

431
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,510
Wethersby Posner is one of

432
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,150
the most prestigious firms in the country.

433
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,780
You said you wanted to help people.

434
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,990
All you'd be doing there is helping fat cats get fatter.

435
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,090
You know, maybe this sermon would have

436
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,840
a little bit more credibility if you weren't so lit right now.

437
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,980
Well, I don't need to be sober

438
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,660
to see what you're doing with your life.

439
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,530
I just wish you could, too.

440
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,210
What were you thinking?

441
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,830
Anyone at that party could have seen you!

442
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,310
Yeah, I pulled the hoodie down to cover my face.

443
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,270
That disguise wouldn't work

444
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,890
even if you smeared grease paint all over your face.

445
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,740
So, what, you came to chastise me at gunpoint?

446
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,140
We got the auction location from the scraper program.

447
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,860
Kang's using a defunct steel factory

448
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,520
owned by your family's company.

449
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,450
I-I don't care. I'm done with the mission.

450
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,820
- Oliver... - No, coming back here,

451
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,220
Maseo, has shown me all the wreckage that I have left behind.

452
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,400
And if I go with you tonight and I get killed,

453
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:16,260
then I lose any chance I've ever had

454
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,810
of fixing all of the things that I broke.

455
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,940
You don't have that chance! Waller will kill you--

456
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,030
My family's resourceful; we have connections in the media.

457
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,250
There has to be a way to shelter us from whatever Waller does.

458
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,510
Look, Oliver,

459
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,400
if you want redemption,

460
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,410
start with all the lives Chien Na Wei's bio weapon could end.

461
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,260
Those people are strangers to me.

462
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,490
These people...

463
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,540
they're my friends and my family.

464
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,560
And they will be ashamed of this selfish choice you're making.

465
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,270
They're already ashamed of me.

466
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,190
Good-bye, Maseo.

467
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,340
Hey! Wait, I think I found a path.

468
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,210
Thea?!

469
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,930
Stop!

470
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,830
What the hell was that?

471
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,130
It was a booby trap.

472
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,660
What kind of psycho would put that thing there?

473
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,700
Me.

474
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,530
Oh, God.

475
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,240
Slade's going to be at the plane. We need to move.

476
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,830
No, no, no, we need to rest, we need to rest,

477
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,000
just a few minutes, ok?

478
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,170
Slade gets to--

479
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:35,080
He will kill us both if you end up passing out, ok?

480
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,690
Ok, ok, ok.

481
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,910
Couple minutes.

482
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,540
Why didn't you tell me about Sara?

483
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,050
Oh, come on.

484
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,970
Every time I bring her up, you end up evading it.

485
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,380
Because this isn't the time.

486
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,610
We just need to focus.

487
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,080
Well, I'm not, ok?

488
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,460
Knowing that you're keeping something from me again--

489
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,560
it's keeping me everything but focused right now.

490
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,000
So tell me.

491
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,500
Malcolm killed Sara.

492
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,100
No. No, he was in Corto Maltese with me, ok?

493
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,980
He didn't kill her directly.

494
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,690
He used someone.

495
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,480
He put them under the influence of a drug...

496
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,940
So she wouldn't know what she was doing.

497
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,130
She?

498
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,260
She who?

499
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,890
You killed Sara.

500
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:40,880
Oh, God.

501
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,040
Oh, God.

502
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:53,200
No, Sara? No, she-she was my friend!

503
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,740
How could you not tell me?!

504
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,160
Because you weren't you.

505
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,090
Oh, God.

506
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,140
You had no control over your actions.

507
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,040
You cannot blame yourself.

508
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,360
You were right about Malcolm, ok?!

509
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,900
He doesn't love me!

510
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,050
I'm an idiot.

511
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,970
No, you're not.

512
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,460
This whole thing with Lian Yu.

513
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,800
This is ridiculous!

514
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,240
And what the hell are we even doing here?

515
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,710
I ask myself the very same question...

516
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,900
over and over.

517
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,000
Slade...

518
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,210
Don't.

519
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,770
Oh, yeah.

520
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,930
You've come a long way.

521
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,120
I have yet to make good with my promise, kid.

522
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,780
Hello, Oliver.

523
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,300
I told myself I was recording this message

524
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,010
in case I died suddenly,

525
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,280
but I wonder if it isn't just easier

526
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,660
to say what I have to say to a video camera.

527
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,580
I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.

528
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,760
I didn't save our city, I failed it.

529
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,280
I did something terrible,

530
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,440
and in my efforts to make it right,

531
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,890
I ignored my conscience and made alliances with terrible people.

532
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,090
There's a book.

533
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,110
A book with a list of all their names.

534
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:49,880
And with these people, I always told myself

535
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,490
that everything I did,

536
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,940
I did for my family.

537
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,310
That's a lie.

538
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,410
Because what good is a family

539
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,460
without a soul?

540
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,740
You can right my wrongs.

541
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,120
You...

542
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,390
can be better than I was.

543
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,060
You can save this city.

544
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,900
I love you.

545
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,450
Thank you all for coming.

546
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,370
I promise that for one of you,

547
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,520
it'll be well worth your time.

548
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,740
You've read the briefing.

549
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,230
With the proper resources,

550
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,900
you can own...

551
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,960
Armageddon.

552
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,590
The bidding will begin

553
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,600
at $50 million.

554
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,120
55?

555
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,580
Do I hear 60?

556
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,460
I have 60 million dollars.

557
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,090
Going once,

558
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,510
going twice...

559
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,690
90 million.

560
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,640
Anyone care to make it an even hundred?

561
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,780
Just a moment.

562
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,070
I don't like uninvited guests.

564
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,980
I'm sorry I'm late.

565
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,240
Actually, you were right on time.

566
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,610
Let's go.

567
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,490
Make the call! Find me the Yamashiros.

568
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,870
They die tonight.

569
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,900
You have a choice to make.

570
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,040
What choice?

571
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,700
Whether or not you want to keep your hand.

572
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,500
Come on, then. You've earned it.

573
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,480
- Thea, don't! - He killed mom!

574
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,420
And he will continue to pay for his crimes,

575
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,950
but not like this!

576
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,040
You're not a killer!

577
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,230
Yeah, tell that to Sara!

578
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,830
What happened to Sara is not on you!

579
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,100
What happens to him is!

580
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,730
All this is what Malcolm wanted.

581
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,660
He freed Slade to prove that we're killers

582
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:14,410
because he wants you to be just like him.

583
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,650
You got to prove to him that you're not.

584
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,080
A flesh wound. You're clearly not the killer,

585
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,910
that your brother is, Thea.

586
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,200
Yeah, I wish that were true.

587
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,460
She's lost, your sister.

588
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,470
No, she's not.

589
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,820
You can see it in her eyes.

590
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,860
She's being touched by darkness.

591
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,290
Was it Merlyn?

592
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,840
He's an interesting man to do that to his own daughter.

593
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:03,350
So now you've lost your father,

594
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,000
your mother,

595
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,100
and now your little sister.

596
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,920
How's the girl with the glasses?

597
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,140
What's her name? Felicity.

598
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:26,530
How many people can Oliver Queen lose

599
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,810
before there is no more Oliver Queen?

601
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,380
Thanks for the trip home.

602
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,550
Have a nice flight back to Hong Kong.

603
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,780
I'm afraid it's not that simple, Mr. Queen.

604
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,140
The hell it's not. You have the Omega.

605
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,080
You have Chien Na Wei. It's over.

606
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,680
I'm sorry to say, that's not up to either one of us.

607
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,830
This him?

608
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,280
General Matthew Shrieve.

609
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,960
You've done your country quite a service today,

610
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,330
Mr. Queen.

611
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,510
That said, I've got some news

612
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,770
you're not going to want to hear.

613
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,250
Well, General, I'm used to that by now.

614
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,150
We're going to need to debrief you.

615
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,920
Back in China.

616
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:36,040
Once that's accomplished

617
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,600
and the Omega's secured,

618
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,630
I'll make sure you go any place in the world you want to go.

619
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,620
Sound fair?

620
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,160
Yeah.

621
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,330
Tommy Merlyn.

622
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,510
Are you stalking me?

623
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,980
Just checking on you.

624
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,500
Things with your father seemed,

625
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,330
they seemed tense.

626
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,630
Your roommate told me

627
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,700
you were taking a job here.

628
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,020
I said that couldn't be true,

629
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,650
that you were going to work for a white shoe firm.

630
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,630
I was.

631
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,590
And then someone reminded me

632
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,260
why I became a lawyer in the first place.

633
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,820
You want to tell me about it over dinner?

634
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,970
Hey, hey, hey, it is just dinner.

635
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:31,530
How many girls have you used those three little words with?

636
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,110
Those are the only three little words I say.

637
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:38,120
Fine.

638
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:39,940
Just dinner.

639
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,120
- Let's go. - Maybe drinks.

640
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,550
- Maybe. - Ok.

643
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,610
Dad.

644
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,290
I didn't know that you were going to be here.

645
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,740
Where else would I be?

646
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,360
Got to think about a way to tell your mom about this.

647
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,720
She already knows.

648
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:28,650
You weren't worried about her heart giving out, then.

649
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,060
You know, if you were going to drink tonight,

650
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,320
you would have done it by now.

651
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,450
Really?

652
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,600
Are you going to get your mask and your billy club

653
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,160
and take it away from me, huh?

654
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,630
- Black Canary? - Dad!

655
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,600
When does your shift start?

656
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,500
Shouldn't you be running around on rooftops by now?

657
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:45,860
Do you remember when I was going to

658
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,880
take that corporate job in San Francisco?

659
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,530
Do you remember what you said to me?

660
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,400
You were mad because I wasn't choosing a life

661
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
where I was going to help people.

662
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,850
It's like you knew.

663
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,980
Already, even then.

664
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,340
You knew that my life was always headed towards that mask.

665
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,980
Do you think that's what I'm all torn up about?

666
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,980
The reason why I want to open up this bottle

667
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,530
and want to crawl inside it is because of what you did to us.

668
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,330
I loved your sister, I loved your mom.

669
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,490
Much like each and want to crawl other,

670
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,320
and you know, these wild spirits.

671
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,330
But you and I, we had something more,

672
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,250
'cause we were the ones that were alike.

673
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:26,080
And we had a trust and we had a bond,

674
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,360
and you broke it.

675
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,450
And I don't know how you could do that to us.

676
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,380
Look, I'm going to survive this.

677
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,070
I mean, I got to, it's my baby girl.

678
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,380
But what you've done,

679
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,580
I don't know how I'm going to live through this.

680
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,980
Daddy, I think we should go to a meeting.

681
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:49,980
Yeah.

682
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,920
I'll go to the one on Broxton.

683
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,780
You go to the one on Fourth.

684
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,660
I need a shower.

685
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,360
I need ten showers.

686
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,850
Thea.

687
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,200
I'm fine.

688
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,800
I would be really, really worried

689
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,870
if that were true.

690
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,180
What do you want to hear?

691
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,720
Nothing.

692
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,370
And I don't want you to tell anyone about this,

693
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,480
especially Laurel.

694
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,990
And why is that?

695
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,710
Because she loves you like a sister,

696
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,410
and it would hurt the both of you too much.

697
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,250
Does she know about Malcolm?

698
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,410
No.

699
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,350
No, that would complicate things,

700
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,550
and despite everything that he has done...

701
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,300
we still need him.

702
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,590
I agree.

703
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,770
I guess A.R.G.U.S. is looking for a few guards

704
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:13,870
to volunteer for island duty.

705
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,950
You almost got us killed.

706
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,970
I simply had more faith in you and my daughter

707
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,410
than you obviously have for yourselves.

708
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,990
How could you do that?

709
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,020
To challenge you, to see if you both could work--

710
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,280
How could you make me kill a friend?

711
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,720
He should not have told you that.

712
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,380
I trusted you.

713
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,170
I let you into my life.

714
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,600
How could you have done this to me?

715
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,090
Because you are my daughter, thea, and I care about you.

716
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,490
Oh, God, that's sick.

717
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,370
And not even remotely true!

718
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,110
You do not understand

719
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,340
the danger we face from Ra's Al Ghul!

720
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,960
Just stop! Stop using him as an excuse.

721
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,560
The only person that I'm afraid of right now is you.

722
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,630
- Please, do not do this... - Please, stop.

723
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,270
I will work with you to stop Ra's.

724
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,500
Because that's what my brother says we need to do.

725
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,740
So I will be your student.

726
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,340
I'll be your partner.

727
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,080
Even if I have to,

728
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,180
I will be your solider.

729
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,780
But never again will I be your daughter.
