19
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,020
You've been gone a long time, Nora.

20
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,290
You're lucky I came back at all.

21
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,410
Really?

22
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,820
I can tell you have questions.

23
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,520
Ask them.

24
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,400
- You killed my grandmother? - I did.

25
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,050
- In front of my father? - I did.

26
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,270
- He was a boy. - Nora--

27
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,880
He was just a kid!

28
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,930
You're right,

29
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,480
and I think of that moment every day,

30
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,250
how it changed the course of destiny

31
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,380
for him,

32
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,710
for you,

33
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,670
for me.

34
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,630
I never knew he had that kind of hatred inside of him,

35
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,060
but he does because of you.

36
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,940
And I have that same hatred inside of me for him!

37
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,740
Or at least I did.

38
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,060
I was inspired by him, as you are.

39
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,510
I wanted to know him, as you do.

40
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,680
I wanted to be him. I wanted to be the Flash.

41
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,930
You will never be the Flash.

42
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,050
Exactly!

43
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,790
And that realization is what broke me.

44
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,680
That's the realization that led me to do

45
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,310
the things that I did.

46
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,040
The terrible, horrible,

47
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,100
evil things I did.

48
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,470
I've been coming here for so long.

49
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,750
Why didn't you tell me what you did?

50
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,240
I thought you must know.

51
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,980
Your mother would've told you.

52
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,120
I was wrong. I see that.

53
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,160
I'm sorry, Nora.

54
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,220
I don't trust you anymore.

55
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,550
Have I not given you everything?

56
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,800
The chance to go back and know a father you never knew?

57
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,230
To learn from him? To run with him?

58
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,000
To run with the Flash.

59
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,760
I showed you how to time travel because...

60
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,270
I want to help you.

61
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,160
No, the only person that you ever help is yourself.

62
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,500
Who told you that?

63
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,910
Your father?

64
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,990
For as long as I can remember,

65
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,520
all I ever thought about was myself,

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,980
and that will not be my legacy.

67
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,350
That will not the legacy of Eobard Thawne!

68
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,580
Let me help you!

69
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,230
I don't want your help.

70
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,430
Not anymore.

71
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,500
So we've got some good news and some bad news.

72
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,720
The good news is that CCPD is still stationed outside

73
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,570
of Grace's room and will remain so until Dwyer's been caught.

74
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,330
But the bad news is,

75
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,050
that means Dwyer won't be visiting her again anytime soon.

76
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,000
And then the worse news is,

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,370
we have no idea where Cicada could be hiding.

78
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,250
Can't we just track him by the dark energy in his dagger?

79
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,920
Well, we can but only when he uses it, which,

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,980
thank God, hasn't been recently.

81
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,010
And he's not showing up on facial recognition?

82
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,380
Unless he decides to make an appearance, we've got zilch.

83
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,340
Which reminds me, where the rest of Team Flash is?

84
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,490
Where's baby giraffe and young Nora?

85
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,420
Ralph's visiting his mom. He said to call if we need him.

86
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,970
- And Nora is... - Right here.

87
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,010
I just stopped by the loft to pick up your blue suit.

90
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,560
Hey, I made that green suit work, though.

91
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,880
What is, uh, that for again?

92
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,830
Mama Cecile's first day back to the courtroom

93
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,930
and Dad's testimony against Weather Witch.

94
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,510
Joss Jackam's trial is later today.

95
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,060
It starts in 30 minutes.

96
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, since my dad is with Jenna visiting Wally,

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,190
why don't I come with you guys and help support Cecile?

98
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,970
Yeah. When are they coming back, by the way?

99
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,010
- They've been gone forever. - Uh, he's not sure.

100
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,430
After having a psychopath break into his home,

101
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,410
I don't think he's in any rush

102
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,650
to bring a newborn back to Central City.

103
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,390
Besides, Cecile has a lot on her plate

104
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,150
with this being her first day back at work.

105
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,330
I can't wait to see Weather Witch

106
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,850
get what she deserves.

107
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,900
Hey, you ready to get those shards out of your hands?

108
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,970
Hell yes!

109
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,580
I haven't been able to play PS4 properly for weeks.

110
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,700
See you in there.

111
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,510
Hey, you feel that?

112
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,260
Feel what?

113
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,210
That's the feeling of free time.

114
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,700
AKA unbillable hours,

115
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,700
so we better not be seeing any invoices from you

116
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,790
in the near future.

117
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,950
Oh, that's all right.

118
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,920
This is one mystery I will solve for free.

119
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,270
The state versus Joslyn Jackam,

120
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,160
Criminal Court of Central City, meta-crime number 99512.

121
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,340
Welcome back to my courtroom, Miss Horton.

122
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,570
I trust your maternity leave was enjoyable?

123
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,980
Thank you, Your Honor.

124
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,160
I am very happy to be back at work.

125
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,800
Yeah, there never really is enough time with a newborn, is there?

126
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,930
There is not. You may proceed.

127
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,190
Thank you, Your Honor.

128
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,140
The prosecution intends to prove

129
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,160
that between November 20th and 27th,

130
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,510
Joslyn Jackam used this device,

131
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,080
a so-called piece of meta-tech,

132
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,760
to unlawfully and intentionally

133
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,950
harm the citizens of Central City.

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,220
Her meta-crimes include

135
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,630
massive property damage at Iron Heights,

136
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,800
the grounding of 21 separate flights at Sheldon County Airport,

137
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,820
and the attempted murder of her own father,

138
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,970
Mark Mardon.

139
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:36,150
Now, this attack on her father was--

140
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,580
Uh, the--

141
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,340
the attack on her father was premeditated.

142
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,830
Um, and...

143
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,990
the prosecution is seeking the--

144
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,560
Are you okay?

145
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,420
Yeah, it's just a...

146
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,250
feeling.

147
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,460
I'll be fine.

148
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,390
The prosecution is seeking the maximum sentence, Your Honor.

149
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,290
Gotcha.

150
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,950
All right, almost done.

151
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,310
Micro-scale surgery is not the easiest.

152
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,040
Is that why you missed these the first time?

153
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,190
Hey, now!

154
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,340
All right, there you go.

155
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,430
Your hands are officially dagger shard free.

156
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,460
Hallelu.

157
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,540
One more thing.

158
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,000
Mm, meta-sutures for meta-wounds,

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,930
that's clever.

160
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,720
Ah! Note to self, ice healing actually hurts.

161
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,150
Don't be a wuss.

162
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,720
Wuss. You're the wuss.

163
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,020
Looks like you've got this whole

164
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,060
Caitlyn/Killer Frost thing down pat.

165
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,630
-  Eh, not totally. -I got it.

166
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,190
But it is getting easier to switch to Killer Frost

167
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,430
when I need to.

168
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,570
So those sutures should stay frozen while the wound heals.

169
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,660
Once they melt, you can take the bandages off.

170
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,560
You'll be good to go.

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,940
I have to confess.

172
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,910
I've actually really enjoyed not having my powers lately.

173
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,490
- Really? - Yeah.

174
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,320
I got used to being Cisco again sans Vibe-age, you know?

175
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,820
And not having villains breathing down my neck

176
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,510
once a week, I have to say, is pretty schway.

177
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,900
Well, if we're gonna defeat Cicada,

178
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,800
we need a fully functioning Vibe.

179
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,320
So hopefully this does the trick.

180
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,860
Here, souvenirs.

181
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,330
- Oh, thank you so much. - You're welcome.

182
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,510
Opening statements are underway

183
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,200
in the trial of Joss Jackam,

184
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,420
otherwise known as Weather Witch.

185
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,750
Just saying, nothing wrong with three or four martinis at lunch.

186
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,080
It is when you get in your Lamborghini and drive.

187
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,060
Sir, sir, focus here.

188
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,610
Touch your nose.

189
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,130
Hey! That's my car!

190
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,360
And then what happened, Miss Pellett?

191
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,750
She created some kind of lightning tornado.

192
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,270
I wasn't sure if any of us were gonna make it.

193
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,770
I got to go.

194
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,940
One moment, please.

195
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,070
I got to go. There's been a car theft.

196
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,700
What are you talking about?

197
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,860
You're my lead CSI witness.

198
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,480
You're on the stand in 30 minutes.

199
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,740
I'm sorry. It's a Lamborghini, all right?

200
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,460
The cops aren't gonna be able to keep up with this thing.

201
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,550
- It'll be quick. - 30 minutes.

202
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,550
- All right. - Miss Horton?

203
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:00,970
Hmm, where were we?

204
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,200
Guys, the car just turned north on 8th,

205
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,380
- headed towards Wakefield. - Got it.

206
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,240
Get ready to take control of the wheel.

207
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,290
- What are you gonna do? - Get the driver.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,010
Here we go.

209
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,890
Dad!

210
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,670
- What's happening? - I can't stop vibrating.

211
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,980
- Guys! We need your help! - Guys!

212
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,170
- With what? - With--

213
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,590
With that?

214
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,590
I can't stop phasing.

215
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,740
And I can't counter-phase him forever.

216
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,740
Okay, that's not good.

217
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,350
If you keep going but you don't,

218
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,510
then you could...

219
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,860
fall to your death.

220
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,620
- Yeah! - What are we gonna do?

221
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,420
Let him.

222
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,500
What?

223
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,170
Yes, if you phase through the floor,

224
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,640
you're actually gonna fall into pipeline cell

225
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,670
directly below us.

226
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,800
And the dampening unit will negate your powers.

227
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,210
Unless we don't time it right.

228
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,070
In which case, your torso would be severed from your legs

229
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,780
as you enter the cell.

230
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,120
- Not helping. - Stop, stop.

231
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,650
Okay, stop. I tr--I trust you Cisco.

232
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,970
Move to the right.

233
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,550
No, my right.

234
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,140
Cisco! Come on!

235
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,430
Okay, stop right there!

236
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,610
- One step back. - Cisco!

237
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,930
Actually, never mind, one step forward.

238
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,540
Okay, ready? Three, two, one, go!

240
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,470
What's going on with me?

241
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,680
So...

242
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,670
the car you touched

243
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,810
was saturated with unstable dark matter.

244
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,120
And because you were phasing at the time,

245
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,510
it caused your body to destabilize

246
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,200
on a cellular level.

247
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,400
When I got close to the driver,

248
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,920
I saw dark matter veins flare up,

249
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,780
just like on the back of Spencer Young's phone.

250
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,930
So the car is a piece of meta-tech?

251
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,740
That or whatever was controlling it.

252
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,410
How long is he gonna have to stay in there for?

253
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,690
Without the help of the power dampeners,

254
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,900
it could take up to a day?

255
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,140
No, no, no, no! I-I have to present evidence on the stand

256
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,480
in, like, ten minutes.

257
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,420
Cecile's gonna kill me.

258
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,420
That's not good.

259
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,900
I could do it.

260
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,110
You can't be serious.

261
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,440
Well, when Dad made me official,

262
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,100
he submitted my paperwork to the court,

263
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,520
so I'm qualified to present forensic evidence.

264
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,850
I can do this.

265
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,340
I cannot believe this is happening on my first day back.

266
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,240
It's my first day back. Okay.

267
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,390
Go to the court reporter. Check in.

268
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,380
Tell her that Barry was in a traffic accident.

269
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,400
Yes.

270
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,120
And, Nora, when you're up there on the stand,

271
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,520
you just follow my lead.

272
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,380
Got it?

273
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,460
Don't worry. Nora can handle this.

274
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,230
It's not that.

275
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,550
I've decided I'm gonna pursue a lighter sentence.

276
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,140
Why the change of heart?

277
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,490
Because I keep feeling these

278
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,860
waves of remorse coming off of Joss.

279
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,730
I think she just wants to start over

280
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,800
so she doesn't turn out like her father.

282
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,320
So, Miss West, can you explain what effect

283
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,110
these conditions had on the Sheldon County Airport?

284
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,860
The facility was hit by winds

285
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,400
ranging from 150 to 250 miles per hour.

286
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,450
Wow, that's-that is pretty dangerous.

287
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,060
And yet not a single person was injured.

288
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,700
Well, no, but that was because--

289
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,870
What about these lightning marks on the tarmac?

290
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,160
Would you say that that is common,

291
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,850
given the nature of the weather

292
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,400
during the incident in question?

293
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,790
Yes, but luckily, in this case,

294
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,200
the lightning only hit the runway

295
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,530
and not the surrounding structures.

296
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,510
The structures where all of the passengers were.

297
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,270
I would say that is pretty lucky indeed.

298
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,150
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

299
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,070
So that's it? You're not gonna ask me anything else?

300
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,170
Well, it would appear so.

301
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,690
Mr. Lee, I think you're up.

302
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,780
Miss West, is my client a meta-human?

303
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,240
No, but she used meta-tech.

304
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,630
Specifically a weather staff

305
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,460
that was corrupted by dark matter.

306
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,820
So one could say it was the staff, not my client,

307
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,140
that attacked the Sheldon County Airport that night?

308
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,070
No, one couldn't. She used that staff.

309
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,050
But isn't this just an ordinary weather staff

310
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,360
corrupted by dark matter?

311
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
These are your words.

312
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,180
Yes, but--

313
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,490
And since dark matter was able to corrupt a tool

314
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,770
and turn it into a weapon of destruction,

315
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,480
isn't it also possible it could corrupt the defendant?

316
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,020
No. Dark matter doesn't make you do things.

317
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,360
She pointed lightning at a hangar full of scared families.

318
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,340
Your Honor, there were little kids in that hangar.

319
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,790
Did you know that--that lightning is five times hotter

320
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,370
than the surface of the sun?

321
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,260
That is the kind of power that the defendant unleashed

322
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,710
upon those people.

323
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,020
She did this.

324
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,770
This was her choice, and she can't be trusted.

325
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,960
No, Miss West, you must sit down.

326
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,870
I know, but, Your Honor--

327
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,740
- Sit down! - No! She's right.

328
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm guilty,

329
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,790
and I should pay for what I did.

330
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,320
- What you doing? - Get a load of this.

331
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,510
You know those shards you removed?

332
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,280
I ran a biochemical analysis on them

333
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,720
and the tissue from my hands.

334
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,680
You know how to do that?

335
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,630
I picked up a thing or two from Caitlin Snow MD

336
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,240
over the years, and I found this.

337
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,520
That's my tissue right after I got sliced.

338
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,040
That's from today.

339
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,570
Almost all the dark matter is gone.

340
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,610
The shards weren't dampening my powers.

341
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,200
They were removing them.

342
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,390
So the dagger has anti-dark matter properties.

343
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,420
Yes!

344
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,620
Cisco, if we can synthesize that into a serum,

345
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,810
we could get rid of Cicada's powers entirely.

346
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,290
And not just his powers, everyone's.

347
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,110
- Everyone's? - Caitlyn,

348
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,530
we could make a meta-human cure.

349
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,330
You think we need a meta-human cure?

350
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,510
Don't you?

351
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,210
Okay, maybe not.

352
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,070
But I seem to remember a time when you did?

353
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,140
Sure, when I first discovered Killer Frost,

354
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,750
I wanted to get rid of her.

355
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,080
But when she was gone, it felt like a piece of me was missing.

356
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,850
Besides, we have seen meta-human powers

357
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,030
do really good things.

358
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,440
Okay, yeah! If you can build an ice bridge

359
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,420
to avoid rush hour traffic,

360
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,560
but what if my existence gives everyone around me

361
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,950
radiation poisoning like "Fallout"?

362
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,600
Those metas,

363
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,370
we created them against their will.

364
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,340
No, Thawne created the particle accelerator

365
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,880
and he sabotaged it.

366
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,030
And who shattered the satellite full of dark matter

367
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,970
and created God knows how many metas?

368
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,190
We did that.

369
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,320
This cure could give meta-humans a second chance

370
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,110
at having a normal life.

371
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,190
Maybe not everyone wants a normal life, Cisco.

372
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,190
Watch out!

373
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,050
Who does this lady think she is?

374
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,270
What the hell?

375
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,020
Who are you?

376
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,820
Your ride. Let's go.

377
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,760
So Joss Jackam never made it to Iron Heights.

378
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,260
Nope, and the transport driver said

379
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,730
that the woman who took her used something

380
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,810
that completely shut down his truck.

381
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,980
Pause.

382
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,130
That. Look familiar?

383
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,200
Ugh, another piece of satellite shard.

384
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,020
So the fob is the meta-tech?

385
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,940
Yeah, probably sends out some kind of dark matter pulse

386
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,140
that overrides any guidance system in seconds.

387
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,670
So as long as she has an engine,

388
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,540
she can control it and

389
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,470
we still don't even know who we're looking for.

390
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,180
Maybe we do. Hey, can you fast-forward?

391
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,040
Stop.

392
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,870
Yeah, look, that salute. She's definitely military.

393
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,280
Okay, let's run that face through the DOD database.

395
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,200
Raya Van Zandt.

396
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,870
Former air force, ace pilot, mechanic,

397
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,160
and expert in vehicle operations.

398
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,320
She was dishonorably discharged.

399
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,120
Call sign was Silver Ghost. Huh?

400
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,000
The rest of her military record was sealed.

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,080
Okay, well, I'm gonna see if my dad can call in a favor

402
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,130
and maybe we can get a copy.

403
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,010
Yeah, and in the meantime,

404
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,620
it looks like we have two bad girls to track down.

405
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,640
I'm not so sure, Nora.

406
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,320
I mean, Cecile said that she could feel Joss' remorse.

407
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,280
Come on, Mom. That was a show.

408
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,950
I mean, do you think this escape was a coincidence?

409
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,680
Uh, well, we don't know yet, Nora.

410
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,570
Yes, we do.

411
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,010
Raya got that fob to break Joss out of the prison transport.

412
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:09,120
I guarantee you Joss is a part of this.

413
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,040
How do you know that?

414
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,460
Because bad people don't change.

415
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,190
Hey, guys, any way you could send down some food?

416
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,860
Welcome to home base.

417
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,120
Home base of what?

418
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,830
The Young Rogues.

419
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,190
There's been enough old men running this town.

420
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,200
Our turn.

421
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,790
I have my eyes on a few candidates,

422
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,680
but for this job, plan on it just being you and me.

423
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,410
Um, I'm not planning anything!

424
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,090
I don't even know who you are! Just take me back!

426
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,230
You ever heard of A.R.G.U.S.?

427
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,950
It's an off-the-grid facility primed with bleeding-edge tech,

428
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,750
and it's protected

429
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,960
by one of the most advanced security systems on Earth.

430
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,530
The only thing that can short it out is

431
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,420
a billion jolts of electricity.

432
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,340
So a few bolts of lightning.

433
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,150
You're the Weather Witch, right?

434
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,920
Beneath this wall is the facility's power junction.

435
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,260
You hit that and we have a four-minute window

436
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,280
to get something that will make us unstoppable.

437
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,810
No, look, even if I was gonna help you,

438
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,890
and I'm not,

439
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,130
I need my weather staff to control any of that,

440
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,550
and right now, that is in police holdup.

441
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,030
So if you could just take me back.

442
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,760
Okay.

443
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,430
To do what?

444
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,270
Turn myself in.

445
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,950
I see.

446
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,350
You don't want to be like your dad.

447
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,120
I get that, but it's too late.

448
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,210
You're a criminal. So am I.

449
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,100
And those people out there,

450
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,490
trust me, all they think is, "Like father, like daughter."

451
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,390
But I guess you need to find that out for yourself,

452
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,370
don't you?

453
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,240
Find me when you do.

454
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,090
Thank you.

455
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,780
That will hold you until you get out--oh!

456
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,490
Uh, can I ask you a question?

457
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,510
Uh, do you have a minute?

458
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,540
Yeah.

459
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,170
Yes, you're not going anywhere.

460
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,960
So, um, last year, you came out of the Speed Force

461
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,550
and you were writing a kind of a symbol language.

462
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,340
Do you remember that?

463
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,660
Yeah, I remember.

464
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,490
And apparently, Cisco could only translate one of these phrases.

465
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,070
Right?

466
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,580
So far, yeah. I mean, Gideon couldn't even do it.

467
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,370
Gideon.

468
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,670
Right, Gideon.

469
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,210
So what do you think that language was?

470
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,260
I don't know. It was some kind of, uh, chronolinguistics.

471
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,950
Chronolinguistics that you got from your time in the Speed Force,

472
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,520
which is all time at once, right?

473
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,450
Past, present, future.

474
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,690
What do you think this language was? Future, maybe?

475
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,610
Why? Is this about Cicada?

476
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,990
Cicada? No, no. No, It's just, um...

477
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,350
le myst¨¨re, huh?

478
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,670
I'm a detective. I see mystery everywhere, so...

479
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,380
all right. Thank you.

480
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,680
See you next time.

481
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,880
Okay--oh! Ah, before I forget,

482
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,010
the Legends, uh, dropped off some, um, books

483
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,490
to help you pass the time.

484
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,400
"Uncaged Desire."

485
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,870
Your kind of caged desire.

486
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,480
Hope you enjoy it.

487
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,700
- See you next time. - Thanks.

488
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,260
Yeah, probably not very good.

489
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,630
See you!

490
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,350
What is it?

491
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,030
According to Doppler, it's a hurricane in Central City.

492
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,680
No, it's not a hurricane. It's Joss.

494
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,750
I'm on it.

495
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,410
What, no Flash today?

496
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,460
Figured he wasn't needed to stop a fake hurricane.

497
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,310
Guess we can add damaging private property

498
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,670
to your r¨¦sum¨¦.

499
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,070
Look, I just need your help.

500
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,240
Oh, stop with the sorry act.

501
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,460
That ended when your friend helped you escape.

502
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,770
She is not my buddy, and I did not escape.

503
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,360
Look,

504
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,960
I want to turn myself back in.

505
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,470
Oh, you really expect me to believe that?

506
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,620
My dad is the career criminal,

507
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,470
not me.

508
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,050
I just...

509
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,270
I want to show everybody

510
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,340
that I'm not the person that they think I am.

511
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,670
Then what do you need me for?

512
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,910
You're a hero.

513
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,950
If you vouch for me,

514
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,900
people will know that I'm telling the truth.

515
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,040
Look, I will tell you everything.

516
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,300
I'll even show you where that woman took me.

517
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,250
Just give me a chance.

518
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,560
If anyone asks, you never saw this.

519
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,790
Thank you, Major Morgan.

520
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:55,900
Please tell the lieutenant general

521
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,380
that my dad and I owe him one.

522
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,460
Special delivery. One Weather Witch.

523
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,120
What? I thought you were gonna help me.

524
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,680
I'm trying to turn myself in.

525
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,830
No, I-I didn't escape. I-I was kidnapped.

526
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,120
Will you please tell them?

527
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,570
Sorry, I don't trust criminals.

528
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,970
She's all yours.

529
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,420
No! No, no! This is a misunderstanding!

530
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,260
This is unfair!

531
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,900
If I could just talk to her, please!

532
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,420
Your father does the exact same thing.

533
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,320
When something's on his mind, he runs.

534
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,910
Nothing's on my mind, Mom.

535
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,480
I got to take a look at Raya Van Zandt's DOD file.

536
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,910
Oh, yeah, did you find the connection

537
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,220
between her and Joss?

538
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,240
Well, there doesn't seem to be one.

539
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,370
Really?

540
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,850
Yeah, she left the air force

541
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,990
after a failed mission overseas,

542
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,830
and then she spent two months on desk duty,

543
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,650
and then she was dishonorably discharged.

544
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,450
But it seems like she has a pretty good service record.

545
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:12,290
Exactly, so clearly the DOD had egg on its face

546
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,240
and Raya became its scapegoat.

547
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,560
I'm just saying, Nora,

548
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,380
not everyone is as bad as they seem.

549
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,160
Raya, Joss. I think everyone deserves a second chance.

550
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,120
If you don't believe me, ask your father.

551
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,620
He gives more second chances than anyone I've ever met.

552
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,980
Come on. Come on.

553
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:45,070
Yes. Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

554
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,780
Yes!

555
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,480
What the hell are you doing?

556
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,340
What the hell are you doing?

557
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,870
Well, I was distilling dark matter ore

558
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,090
from Cicada's dagger shards.

559
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,380
But I can't really do that anymore, can I?

560
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,480
Whoops.

561
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,830
Why did you do that?

562
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,160
You're smart. You can figure it out.

563
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,090
When are you gonna figure out that

564
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,040
a meta-cure could actually help people?

565
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,190
Listen, I heard all about it, short stuff.

566
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,630
But you know what? Caity and I,

567
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,350
we're doing just fine,

568
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,510
and so were you until Cicada got all up in your head.

569
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,020
Don't do that. This isn't just about me.

570
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,060
Oh, the hell it isn't!

571
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,180
And--and you know what? I get it.

572
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,690
He tried to kill you.

573
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,160
You're trying to create something that'll save us all.

574
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah, I am!

575
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,920
All of us!

576
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,990
Barry, Iris, Nora, they have a family.

577
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,360
Even you and Caitlyn have your weird little family.

578
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,820
But what about my family?

579
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,810
I want a wife to grow old with.

580
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,520
I want a kid.

581
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,420
And I don't want them to wonder all the time

582
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,820
if their dad is in trouble,

583
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,580
if he's even gonna make it home tonight.

584
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,610
Cisco, you don't have to choose between having powers

585
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,000
and having a family.

586
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,470
Yeah? Well, some of us do.

587
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,220
I'm not the Flash.

588
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,940
I don't want to be the Flash.

589
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,870
I want to be me.

590
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,830
A cure is the only way.

591
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,510
Or it was.

592
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,180
What?

593
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,740
Oh, come on, girl.

594
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,880
You're reading Mick's book?

595
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:38,980
This is...

596
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,110
surprisingly well-written.

597
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,390
What's going on?

598
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,650
Just having a hard time believing some people can change.

599
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
How come?

600
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,380
'Cause after everything that you've seen,

601
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,780
don't you think that bad people stay bad?

602
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,770
Not always.

603
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,180
When I first met Leonard Snart, he was a criminal.

604
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,830
Probably the worst criminal in the city.

605
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,800
But I--

606
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,110
you know, I knew

607
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,100
that there was a good person in there somewhere,

608
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,310
and look at him.

609
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,760
Turned out to be a Legend.

610
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,730
Died a hero.

611
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,340
If he can change, anyone can.

612
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,750
You really believe that?

613
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,500
Yeah. I do.

614
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:38,130
What about Eobard Thawne?

615
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,390
I think...

616
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,430
part of being a hero

617
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,150
is being able to see the good in people.

618
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,980
So yeah, maybe someday in the future...

619
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,120
even Thawne could change.

620
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,960
Besides, if we don't believe in people,

621
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,930
who will?

622
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,360
Very funny!

623
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,300
I got 595s!

624
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,230
We got a lot of vehicles! Let's go.

625
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,420
Copy that. Suit up!

626
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,210
We've got multiple 595s in our own parking lot!

627
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,020
Get out there quick!

628
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,850
Requesting more backup! We've got a lot!

629
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,090
What are you doing here?

630
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,200
Doing what no one else is gonna do for you...

631
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,920
Offer you a second chance...

632
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,110
Weather Witch.

633
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,330
That's it.

634
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,190
That's where the power junction is.

635
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,790
Give it everything you got.

636
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,110
- What the hell was that? - I don't know, sir.

637
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,100
But it knocked out security grids 41 through 60.

638
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,310
Ten years and $24 million later,

639
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,760
the stealth automobile, AKA the SAM, was born.

640
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,600
Rumor has it that everything under its hood

641
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,830
comes directly from WayneTech.

642
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,630
This is a $24-million prototype?

643
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,800
What can it do?

644
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,360
Let's find out.

646
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,680
Is it Joss or Raya?

647
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,070
I'm guessing both because someone just stole

648
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,120
a very expensive vehicle from A.R.G.U.S.

649
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,830
after a very precise lightning strike.

650
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,560
It's a next-gen prototype

651
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,830
with all the bells and whistles.

652
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,580
If bells and whistles could explode and murder people.

653
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,970
And supposedly it's untrackable.

654
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:47,910
So how do we find it?

655
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,910
- We don't search for the car. - We search for them.

656
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,540
If Joss made lightning strike again,

657
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,920
it means she has her staff.

658
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,220
Oh, so we can track the dark matter in it. Nice!

659
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,550
I got the location.

661
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,440
Okay, remember, Nora, whatever you do,

662
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,790
don't touch the car while using your powers.

663
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,090
Hey, Caitlin, can I steal you for a second?

664
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,740
Joyride's over, Silver Ghost.

665
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,770
Joss, I need to talk to you.

666
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,040
Hard pass.

667
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,670
Got to love remote detonation.

668
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,260
Icy roads ahead.

669
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,850
Oh, my God. Raya!

670
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,200
Raya!

672
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,060
Holy Buckaroo Banzai.

674
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,410
It phases?

675
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,750
Whatever phase-trick they just used,

676
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,920
it jammed our tracking.

677
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,940
We can't get a lock on them

678
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,830
if she doesn't use that weather staff.

679
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,950
XS is gonna come after us.

680
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,360
Let her try.

681
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,760
Hear no evil, see no evil.

682
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,120
We're invisible.

683
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,780
Hey, Cisco?

684
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,760
Can you connect me to the car's comm system?

685
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,410
No, but best I can do is have you send out radio waves,

686
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,360
and if the car's nearby, it'll pick them up.

687
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,490
Do it.

688
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,600
Joss? Joss, it's XS. I hope you can hear me.

689
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,250
You tried to tell me something earlier.

690
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,870
You tried to tell me that you wanted to pay

691
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,930
for the crimes that you committed.

692
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:32,260
You said you weren't a criminal like your father.

693
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,150
You asked me to give you a second chance,

694
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,560
but I didn't listen.

695
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,390
Now I'm asking you for a second chance.

696
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,600
Joss, this isn't who you are.

697
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,570
Nora, the car's headed straight for you.

698
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,030
I don't see anything.

699
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,480
Nora, look out!

700
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,900
How the hell did I lose control?

701
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,210
Hey, hold on to me. This is gonna feel weird.

702
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,600
Well, at least we got their wheels.

703
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,880
What's left of them.

704
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,750
Thanks for the last-minute rescue.

705
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,120
- For the what? - Icing up the road.

706
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,080
I didn't ice the road.

707
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,140
What? Who...

708
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,280
And...

709
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,770
Time! 24 hours are up.

710
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,300
Okay, I double-checked with Caitlin,

711
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,450
and there doesn't seem to be any unstable dark matter

712
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,070
in your biometric scans.

713
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,050
Okay.

714
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,130
Man, it feels good to be out of there.

715
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,340
We definitely missed you, Dad.

716
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,000
Sorry I haven't been able to help with everything.

717
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,550
Do we know where Joss and Raya are now?

718
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,850
No, we got nothing yet.

719
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,110
But you were right about Joss.

720
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,270
She saved my life.

721
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,710
If she hadn't iced over the road...

722
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,900
But she did because you connected with her.

723
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,850
It's like Dad said,

724
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,830
she just needed someone to believe in her.

725
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,650
Sounds like you found your own Leonard Snart.

726
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,420
Well, time might prove me wrong, but I think so.

727
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,560
I hope so.

728
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,750
I'm sorry I messed up your first day back.

729
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,570
It's all right, Nora. There's always day two.

730
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,150
- I'm happy you're back. - Thanks.

731
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,800
Hey do you wanna help me find Cisco?

732
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,070
I gotta get this extrapolator thing recalibrated.

733
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,310
I went to go see Joe in Tibet, and I ended up in Fiji.

734
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,990
Being a parent sure is hard sometimes.

735
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,680
Yeah, it is.

736
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,220
But there's nothing like it.

737
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,830
Okay, well, we can't both be the basket case.

738
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,150
"We're all pretty bizarre.

739
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,500
Some of us are just better at hiding it."

740
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,150
Come on, "Breakfast Club"?

741
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,320
It's one of the only movies

742
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,220
Killer Frost and I actually agree on.

743
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,540
Let me guess, she's into Bender?

744
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,710
- Totally. She loves him. - Yeah, makes sense.

745
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,260
- I'd ship that. - Put that on.

746
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,840
It's cold where we're going.

747
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,820
Your dad's old lab.

748
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,230
Cool.

749
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,810
Caitlin, why did you bring me here?

750
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,580
Because despite our last encounter with him,

751
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,550
he did create a meta-gene.

752
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,190
So I was thinking that you could use his research

753
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,520
to do the reverse.

754
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,660
Um, okay,

755
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,610
don't look now, but if I didn't know any better,

756
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:48,390
I'd say this feels a lot like you helping me

757
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,710
make a meta-human cure.

758
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,320
I couldn't stop thinking about

759
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,720
what you said about how a cure

760
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,520
would give you a second chance at a normal life.

761
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,660
No friend would stand in the way of that.

762
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,610
But there is a difference between you standing in my way

763
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,000
and you actively helping me.

764
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,280
I still think this is dangerous, but...

765
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,550
maybe if I'm involved, we can have some ground rules.

766
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,040
Like the first and most important,

767
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,400
we will never, ever force a cure on anyone.

768
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,940
Okay.

769
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,060
Rule number one.

770
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,440
We're not just here to make a cure.

771
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,440
We're here to make a choice.

772
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:53,850
Nora.

773
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,550
You either trust me, or you don't.

774
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,830
There's no in-between.

775
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Fine.

776
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,880
I don't trust you.

777
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,620
But I'm willing to give you the chance to change my mind.

778
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,350
Well, that might take some time.

779
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,260
And time, as you may recall,

780
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,110
is not on my side.

781
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,970
Minutes are minutes,

782
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,310
seconds are seconds,

783
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,770
and there's very few of them left.

784
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,890
I want to believe that

785
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,140
there is good inside of you somewhere, Thawne.

786
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,950
Let me prove there is.

787
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,390
Okay.

788
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,720
What's next?

789
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,790
Hello, Dr. Wells.

790
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,830
Hello, Gideon.

791
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,840
I have access to all the files?

792
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,520
- Right? - Of course.

793
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,930
Which files would you like me to locate?

794
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,870
I would like you to locate the files

795
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,740
from Nora West-Allen.

796
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,800
I'm sorry, Dr. Wells,

797
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,770
but all entries have been permanently deleted

798
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,150
by Nora West-Allen.
