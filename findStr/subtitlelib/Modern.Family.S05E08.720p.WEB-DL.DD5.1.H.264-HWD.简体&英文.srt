他们怎么会没接到我们的预订

老爸  你跟老妈结婚三十年

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,740
只不过是再睡几天沙发而已
It's just a couple of nights on the couch.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,740
我要给会议主办方打电话

00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,110
让酒店退9.95元的无线网费用
I'm gonna try to squeeze them on that $9.95 wifi fee.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,130
不就是在卖空气嘛
They're selling air.

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,130
橱柜展销会是北美橱柜行业
ClosetCon is the premier north American trade show

8
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,750
第一大展销会
for the closet industry.

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,080
我几年前开始不再参加
I stopped going years ago

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,790
因为这是"出"柜行业的展销会
'cause it's a trade show for the closet industry.

11
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,880
谢谢
Thank you.

给你点小建议
Little advice --

19
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,530
那些会议都是给菜鸟开的
the convention floor is for suckers.

20
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,110
真正的工作都是在酒吧里完成的
All work is done at the bar --

21
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,240
除非托尼和蕾拉在唱流行歌曲
Unless Tony G. and Layla are singing standards,

22
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,520
那样的话  别工作了  尽情欣赏吧

老爸  我是来这里学习的

24
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,050

你爱干嘛干嘛  我要去喝杯威士忌

00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,700
还早餐呢  叫午餐比较合适吧
Breakfast? Try lunch.

29
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,510
-我们农场人起床早  -必须的

我来帮你戴餐巾
Let's get you all squared away here.

32
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,270
我自己来  不用了  我自己来
Yeah, I-I got it. No, I got it.

33
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,320
放下面  这样就好  没事了
Down here. I'm good. I'm good. Now, I know --

34
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,100
我都忘了
You know, I forgot how

35
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,850
这里有这么多农活要干了
much work there was to be done around here.

36
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,660
我上午一直在修栅栏[双关:改善关系]
I've been mending fence all morning.

37
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,140
一直在修  真的吗
Been mending, have you?

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,110
密苏里
Missouri.

39
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,220
痛苦之地
Misery.

40
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,500
-好大的猪圈啊  -真可爱

老爸去城里了  他要到晚饭时候才回来

42
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,670
所以我在帮妈妈喂猪
so I'm helping mama slop the pigs.

43
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,950
你要来贡献点力量吗
You want to -- you want to pitch in?

44
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,360
不知道  我刚刚吃了培根  所以
I don't know, I just ate that bacon, so...

45
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,660
去喂猪似乎不太合适
How's that gonna look?

46
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,930
要不要敲响开饭铃  小超声波
Want to ring the dinner bell, "Little bomber"?

47
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,640
那说起来很古雅呢
Oh, that's actually really quaint.

48
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,110

不要了  亲爱的  一次就够了
No, sweetheart. I think once was enough.

52
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,300
还真有畜生朝这声音跑来的
There's actually an animal that runs toward that sound, huh?

谁说去参加橱柜大会的人才有美好时光

没人  没人那么说
No one. No one says that.

64
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,490
我告诉你  我去开门时
I am telling you, the way he looked at me

65
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,450
他看着我的样子  绝对是迷上我了
when I came to the door -- it is so on.

66
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,240
看起来就是他来送披萨
Kind of seemed like he was just delivering pizza,

67
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,220
你得付钱的样子呗
and you were giving him money.

查克  昨晚送披萨的小伙子

71
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,030

完全不是海莉喜欢的型
Hardly Haley's type.

73
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,800
天呐  你爱上他了

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,040
什么  才没有  你怎么会说我爱上他

他才来过家里三次

76
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,120
太荒谬了  海莉  别看我

你知道什么对我帮助最大吗
You know what's super-helpful?

81
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,670
就是站在你后面的家伙叫你"大汗山"
When the guy in line behind you calls you "Mount Sweatmore."

greeted her every day after school

151
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,020
和笑容迎接她
with a big hug and a giant smile,

152
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,920
我总是想  "是啊
And I always thought, "Yeah...

153
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,080
那样也挺不错的"
wouldn't mind a piece of that."

154
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,780
-要这样做吗  -我下午带去你房间里
- So, are we doing this? - I'll bring it to your room this afternoon.

155
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,460
对于新来橱柜展的人  我们有个小传统
We have a little tradition at ClosetCon for rookies,

156
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,790
今年是克莱尔
which Claire is this year.

157
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,980
我们把一具骨架藏在他们的橱柜里
We take a skeleton. We hide it in their closet.

158
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,810
他们打开柜门  然后大声尖叫
They open the door and scream,

159
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,870
我们大家都哄堂大笑
and we all have a good laugh.

160
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,320
这主意不是我们想出来的
Can't take full credit for the idea.

161
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,330
是从壁橱展上学的
We stole it from CabinetCon.

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,100
热苹果酒
Hot cider.

163
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,200
好  谢谢你  巴布
Oh, yes. Thank you, Barb.

164
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,720
-太感谢你了  -外面好冷
- Thank you so much. - It's chilly.

165
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,320
这酒真带劲
Mmm. Wow, that's got a kick.

166
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,620
那是朗姆酒的力道
That'll be the rum.

167
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,150
我能感受到它温暖你的小肚肚
I can feel it warming up your belly.

168
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,900
还在我嘴里和喉咙里呢
Yeah, still in my mouth and throat.

169
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,610
那是什么
Well, what's that?

170
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,550
开始变冷了啊
Boy, it starting to get nippy, huh?

171
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,270
你们想走去野鸭池塘吗
You guys want to walk down to the duck pond?

172
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,580
听起来挺不错的  我去拿枪
Um -- that sounds lovely. I'll get the gun.

173
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,970
-大家伙儿都来吗  -大家伙儿
- Are y'all coming? - "Y'all"?

174
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,970
-我们不说大家伙儿  -我们说的
- We don't say "Y'all"! - Yeah, we do.

175
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:09,210
我们在这里说  但一般不说
No, well, yeah, we say it... here, but not normally.

176
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,100
你觉得我其实是这样说话的
Well, did you ever think this is how I really talk

177
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,640
我离开这里时  说的话就不一样了吗
and that I talk different-like when I'm not here?

178
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,610
大家伙儿在吵架吗
Y'all fighting?

179
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,680
不不  亲爱的  我们只是在聊天
No, no, sweetie, we're just having a conversation

180
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,230
聊你二爸有多么高傲
about how your daddy can be so stuck-up.

181
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,490
小卡  你真"成熟"
Cam, that's really mature.

182
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,760
利用我们的女儿来挖苦我
Use our daughter to get your little digs in.

183
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,110
我绝不会那样做的  亲爱的
I would never do that, sweetie.

184
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,100
你觉得我没发现
You don't think I notice

185
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,880
我们来这里后你有多高傲吗
how condescending you are when we come here?

186
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,820
你"作"在门廊上  翻白眼
You just set on the porch. You roll your eyes.

187
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,690
什么也不参与
You don't participate in anything.

188
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,830
对  我说的是"作"
And, yeah, I said "Set."

189
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,470
但我们这里就是这样说话的
But that's how we talk here.

190
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,470
这里是我的家乡  我为它感到骄傲
I'm from this place. I'm proud of this place.

191
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,310
我很难过我爱的人觉得这是个大笑话
And it hurts me that the man I love just thinks it's some big joke.

192
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,440
走吧  亲爱的
Come on, sweetie.

193
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,870
仁慈的主啊
Lord a'mercy.

194
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,780
我饿死了  晚餐怎么办啊
Ugh. I'm starving. What are we gonna do about dinner?

195
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,150
我问过爸爸了  订了几块西奥家的匹萨
I checked with dad, and I ordered a couple pizzas from Theo's.

196
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,250
我就知道  你在跟踪我的匹萨帅哥
I knew it! You're stalking my pizza guy!

197
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,110
他不喜欢你  好吗
He is not into you, okay?

198
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,080
他叫过你"棕眼姑娘"吗
Does he call you "Brown eyes"

199
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
多给过你酥炸芝士条吗
and give you extra mozzarella sticks?

200
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,270
够了  你俩
Okay, that's it, you two!

201
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:00,220
你们不能像争珠宝或者鞋子一样争男人
You cannot fight over men like it's jewelry or shoes.

202
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,730
如果你俩都喜欢他  谁也不许去追
If you're both interested, no one makes a move.

203
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,600
姐妹第一  男人第二
Sisters before misters!

204
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,920
-跟踪狂  -荡妇
- Stalker! - Trollop.

205
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,630
不知道那是什么意思
Ha-ha, don't know what it means --

206
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,830
-你做了什么  -我没做什么
- What did you do?! - Nothing!

207
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,080
就是你  你把它打开了
Aah! Yes, you did! You turned it on,

208
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,140
现在螺旋桨都缠在一起了
and now the propeller's all tangled up!

209
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,100
我为什么要那样做
Why would I do that?

210
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,350
因为我的匹萨帅哥就要来了
'cause my pizza guy is coming,

211
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,690
现在我头发里有一架飞机
and now I have airplane in my hair!

212
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,280
我发誓我没有  海莉
I swear I didn't, Haley. Okay.

213
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,080
我来帮你弄出来  天啊
I'll get it out. Oh, my god, ow!

214
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,820
-发生什么了  -我不知道
- What is happening?! - I don't know!

215
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,950
你找到了一个小玩具吗
Ohh, you find a little toy?

216
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,340
刚在车道上
Hey, was that aunt Marge

217
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,760
横冲直撞的是玛吉姑妈吗
just tearing down the driveway?

218
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,080
对  她带来了一份小"礼物"
Yes. And she dropped off a little present.

219
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,080
这是我的小卡卡吗
Is that my Cam Cam?

220
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,400
-奶奶  -你好啊
- Gram gram! - Oh, you.

221
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,070
最近发布了风暴预警
There have been some storm warnings,

222
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,120
玛吉觉得她在这里更加安全
so Marge thought she'd be safer over here.

223
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,490
但她很快让她下了车
But she dropped her off so fast

224
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,430
我们都没时间整理一下[straight暗指直男]
that we didn't even have a chance to straighten up.

225
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,500
我们从没和奶奶说基佬的事
We never told gram about the gay.

226
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,140
他们年事已高
You know, after they reach a certain age,

227
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,790
可能听到了这件事
you worry that it could

228
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,390
一激动就一命呜呼了
be the thing that sends them over the edge,

229
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,950
而她已经随时都可能驾鹤西去了
And she's been on the edge for a long time.

230
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,010
实际上她排在二号临终床上
We're actually on deathbed number two.

231
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,940
米奇尔  米奇尔
Mitchell. Mitchell.

232
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,220
好吧  这怎么回事
Okay. W-what's this?

233
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,270
这是我准备好去喂猪  打包或者挤奶了
This is me ready to slop, bale, or milk something.

234
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,000
你没必要这样做
You don't need to do that.

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,480
不  小卡  我知道
No, I -- Cam, I-I know.

236
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,200
我知道我对你真实的一面过于苛责
I know I gave you hell for being who you really are,

237
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,920
-我想补偿你  -好吧  但你知道吗
- and I want to make that up to you. - Yeah, but you know what?

238
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,430
穿上我姐姐的周日工作服就足够了
Putting on my sister's Sunday overalls is gesture enough.

239
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,320
-这是什么  -我咀嚼的稻草
- What's this? - Oh, it's my chewing straw.

240
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,720
-这不是稻草  -这只是作秀啦
- It's not straw. - Oh, it's just show -- for show.

241
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,140
-别过去  别过去  -你爱这个男人
- Hey. Come on, come on. - You know, you love the man,

242
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,650
-要爱他的家乡  -是  但你知道吗
- you love the world he comes from. - Yeah, but you know what?

243
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,930
我不知道是这套农场装还是其它的缘故
I don't know if it's these farming clothes or what,

244
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,740
此时此刻我觉得和你好亲近
but I am feeling so close to you right now.

245
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,170
-这话真贴心  -快亲我一下
- Well, that's so sweet. - Now give me a kiss.

246
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,460
不行  现在不行
No, not right now.

247
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,440
别逼我扑倒你
Well, don't make me rassle you down.

248
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,960
这人是谁
Who's this?

249
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,120
惨了
Oh, dear.

250
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,640
奶奶  这位是巴德  新来的农工
Uh...well, grams, this is Bud, our new farmhand.

251
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,120
巴德
Bud?

252
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,610
是的  巴德脑袋被驴踢过
Yeah, Bud's a little simpleminded

253
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,430
所以脑子有点不好使  是不是
on account of getting mule-kicked, isn't he?

254
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,200
巴德  你该知道你是不能进屋的
And you know the rules on being in the house, Bud.

255
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
快出去吧
Now, go on outside.

256
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,700
我们过一会儿还得挤牛奶呢
We're gonna milk the cows in a few minutes.

257
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,410
出去挤奶吧  挤完请你吃饭
Get on out there. Have a treat afterwards.

258
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,140
所有零件都在这里了
Here's what we've got to work with.

259
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,480
干得漂亮  我已经和佛罗里达州连线了
Nicely done. I've got Florida on the line.

260
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,780
爸  我把你放到这里  你是模型专家
Dad, I'm flying you in. You're the model expert.

261
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,530
儿子  我们要组装什么东西
What are we looking at, son?

262
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,610
我的神呐
Holy Moses.

263
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,920
这是碎成1300块的阿波罗号啊
More like Apollo 1,300 pieces!

264
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,350
看来太空里的人没有什么幽默感
In space, I guess no one can hear you be hilarious.

265
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,250
我需要你专心一点
I need you to focus.

266
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,930
-万一杰看到这个...  -我知道了
- If Jay sees this... - I know!

267
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,180
爸  这里三个好男人全都靠你了
Dad, you've got three good men here depending on you.

268
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,870
不多说了  我现在要按一个键
Say no more -- I'm gonna tap a button now

269
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,740
可能会把我屏幕上
that's either gonna make you

270
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,670
你们的影像放大  或者
larger on my screen or --

271
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,690
我们和佛罗里达失去联系了
We've lost Florida.

272
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,690
现在就把骷髅架拿过来  我刚到房间
Yeah, yeah. Bring the skeleton up now. I just got to the room.

273
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,860
你好呀  爸
Hey, dad.

274
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,160
你好  女儿
Hey, honey.

275
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,880
我还以为我们是约在餐厅见呢
I thought we were meeting at the restaurant.

276
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,000
没错  那场演讲结束得有些早
Yeah, well, the lecture got done a little early,

277
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,180
而且我似乎成了今晚的明星
and I was kind of the star of the evening.

278
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,980
我杜撰出来一个词引得全场爆笑
I got a huge laugh when I coined the phrase

279
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,550
"柜尊"[与自尊近似]
"Shelf-esteem."

280
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,430
好笑吧
Huh? Yeah?

281
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,770
我得发短信告诉菲尔
Okay, I'll text it to Phil.

282
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,270
你何不到楼下大厅去发  信号会比较好
Why don't you go down to the lobby? You'll get a stronger signal.

283
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,960
-你好  -丽塔
- Oh. Hello. - Rita.

284
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,440
-这是我女儿  克莱尔  -你好
-This is my daughter, Claire. - Hi.

285
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,760
克莱尔  这位是丽塔
Claire, this is Rita.

286
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,300
我和你爸认识好多年了
Your dad and I go way back.

287
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,290
第一次见面的时候  我就告诉他
First time we met, I told him

288
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,370
他得进修一下"衣架"管理课程
he needed a course in "Hanger" Management.

289
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,030
[原词是anger management:愤怒管理]

290
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,590
现在回想都挺逗的
It's still funny.

291
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,960
说真的吗
Seriously?

292
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,140
她老公是从事服装生意的
Her husband's in the garment business.

293
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,870
他给我做了套西服
He made me a suit.

294
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,020
我做衣柜  他做衣柜里面的衣服
I make the closets, and he fills them.

295
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,010
天作之合
Match made in heaven.

296
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,840
那个餐厅里的人都很难缠
Honey, they're kind of sticklers at that restaurant.

297
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,250
要不你先去占座  我把这个放到屋里
Why don't you grab our table? I'll put this in the room.

298
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,060
好的  这就去
Uh, okay. Will do.

299
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,760
非常高兴见到你
Um, really nice to meet you.

300
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,550
楼下见了
See you downstairs.

301
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,860
我其实想走楼梯
I actually am gonna take the stairs.

302
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,480
电梯实在太慢了
That elevator is slow.

303
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,000
是我多想了
Hey, was it just me,

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,690
还是她看我的眼神确实有点怪
or was she looking at me weird?

305
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,920
我也有点感觉
I did kind of sense that.

306
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,470
她不会是知道了我们的事情吧
You don't think she knows about our deal?

307
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,560
怎么会  那件事都过去20年了
How could she? It was 20 years ago.

308
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,180
何况我从来没告诉过别人
And I never told anyone.

309
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,660
她还会介意这个吗
Would she even care?

310
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,340
介意我试图拆散她和她嫁的那个男人吗
That I tried to get rid of the man she ended up marrying?

311
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,590
你又没有攻击那个男人
Well, it's not like you took a hit out on him.

312
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,880
你只不过是让我给他
You had me offer him a job

313
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
在最好的州找了份工作
in the greatest state in the union.

314
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,860
好了  德克萨斯粉丝
Okay, Tex.

315
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,700
我从没对谁说过  她怎么会知道
If I never said anything, how could she know?

316
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,480
我第一个找上的人不是你
You're not the first one I approached.

317
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,150
你只是第一个答应的而已
You're just the first one who said yes.

318
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,610
-我受够了  受够了  -拜托
- I'm done. I'm done - Come on.

319
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,840
求你了  扮演一下巴德  就一两天
Please, just be Bud -- for a couple days.

320
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,090
你可以干些杂活儿  然后或许
You can do some chores, maybe I can

321
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,940
我再呵斥你两句  装得更像点
berate you a little bit to really sell it.

322
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,800
你听不出你的话有多过分吗
Do you hear how insane you sound?

323
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:09,860
让我干杂活儿
Chores?

324
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,710
好吧  你知道吗
All right, you know what?

325
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,510
你想怎么对付你奶奶随便你
You -- you deal with your grandmother however you want.

326
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,050
-我和莉莉要去找酒店住  -不行
- Lily and I will just go get a hotel room. - No, you can't.

327
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,590
好吧  没酒店就找汽车旅馆或粮仓
Fine. Motel, silo --

328
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,170
什么都行
whatever you got around here.

329
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,440
不  那个警报表示龙卷风这就要来了
No, that alarm means there's a tornado coming right now.

330
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,730
我的天  莉莉在哪里
Oh, god. Well, where's lily?

331
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,390
但愿她不会还在田里
I hope she's not still out in the field.

332
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,030
莉莉
Lil-y-y-y-y!

333
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,980
你不能像唤猪一样地叫她
You can't just call her like a pig!

334
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,240
莉莉
Lil-y-y-y-y-y!

335
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,210
好吧  只能在农场这样叫
Okay, this is just a farm thing,

336
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,170
回到城里大商场可不行
not, like, a mall thing.

337
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,250
-你说什么  城市之声  -快走吧
- What's that, city voice? Hmm? - Just go.

338
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,360
这个缠得真够紧的
This is really in there good.

339
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,160
让她离我远点
Get her off of me.

340
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,680
她身上的傻气要渗透给我了
I'm getting dumb through osmosis.

341
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,030
我才没有渗透这种东西
I don't have osmosis.

342
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,910
太好了  查克把披萨送来了
Oh, great. Chuck's here with the pizza.

343
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,660
歌洛莉亚  你可以去开下门吗
Gloria, can you please get it?

344
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,890
不行  你们两个得对彼此友善点
No. You two be nice to each other

345
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,460
自己解决
and figure it out.

346
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,490
你好  查克
Oh, hey, Chuck.

347
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,050
我没想到你今晚还要工作
I didn't think you'd be working tonight.

348
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,250
你好  你怎么会在这里
Hey. What are you doing here?

349
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,850
这里是我外公的家
Oh, this is my grandfather's house.

350
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,030
后院有游泳池  你会游泳吗
There's a pool. Do you swim?

351
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,260
看你这身材一定会
You look like you swim.

352
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,730
我确实会游
I do.

353
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,630
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

354
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,380
你还好吧
You okay?

355
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
还好  没事  有点抽筋而已
Oh, yeah. Totally. Just a cramp.

356
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,860
我经常锻炼  稍等一下
I work out. One second.

357
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,980
-你个小...  -闭嘴
- You little... - Shut up.

358
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,870
你好啊
Hey, you.

359
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,570
你好  棕眼美女
Hey, brown eyes.

360
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,210
好的  谢谢  再见
Okay, cool. Thanks. Bye.

361
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,420
再见
Bye!

362
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,940
-干嘛  -闭嘴  笨蛋
- What? - Shut up, dork.

363
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,540
别紧张  亲爱的
Don't be nervous, honey.

364
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,970
没有什么好害怕的
There's nothing to be scared of.

365
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,560
放轻松  妈妈  别把屁股摔了
Take it easy, mama. Don't break a hip.

366
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,540
告诉你吧
I'm telling you right now.

367
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,120
我才不要假装成别人
I am not pretending to be something I'm not,

368
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,050
尤其是当着女儿的面
especially in front of our daughter.

369
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,440
我六年都不能当着你爸的面亲你
Oh, so I can't kiss you in front of your dad for six years,

370
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,030
你就不能为了我忍两天吗
and you can't give me two days?

371
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,110
我们是为了不让老太太难过
We're saving an old lady some unnecessary upset.

372
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,590
为什么不给她多点信任呢
Why don't you give her a little credit?

373
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,850
她说不定比你想的更开明
She might be more open-minded than you think.

374
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,330
你个可爱的小中国娃
Well, you're a cute little Chinese thing.

375
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,560
奶奶  其实她是越南人
Actually, gram, she's, uh, from Vietnam,

376
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,240
她叫莉莉
and her name's Lily.

377
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,820
爸爸  我们还得在这呆多久
Dad, how long do we have to stay down here?

378
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
"爸爸"
"Dad"?

379
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
好吧  看来真没辙了
Okay, well, I guess there's no way around this.

380
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,230
其  其实
Ac-- actually, ma'am...

381
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,710
她是我家的
...she's my kin.

382
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,270
那你是有个中国妻子咯  巴德
So, you got a Chinese wife, Bud?

383
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,920
不是  我去了趟越南
No, I-I-I went to vietnam,

384
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,340
自己领养了个娃
and I did myself some adopting,

385
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,950
现在我就孤身一人养着她
And now I'm raising her all by my lonesome.

386
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,440
我从没想到有生之年还能见识这种事
Well, I never thought I'd live long enough to see that.

387
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,050
大家都没想到
None of us did.

388
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,680
但我想世上最重要的就是家庭了
But I guess there's nothing more important than family...

389
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,610
不管这家庭是如何建立的
no matter how they come.

390
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,840
您真是太开明了
Well, that is mighty open-minded of you.

391
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,560
有人就不懂分享这种进步
Some folks 'round these parts don't share that progressive--

392
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,450
这种进步的情感
I say progressive-- sensibility.

393
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,840
青菜萝卜  各有所爱
To each his own.

394
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,160
但我确实希望
But I do wish I had another

395
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,260
能有这么个小不点儿来宠爱
little one like that to spoil.

396
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,560
要是我说你确实有个曾孙女呢
What if I told you you did have a great-grandbaby?

397
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,430
-什么  -小卡
- What? - Cam...

398
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,410
没关系  妈妈
It's okay, mama.

399
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,860
要是我说我恋爱了
What if I told you I was in love,

400
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,450
而且我此生从未如此幸福
and that I've never been happier in my entire life,

401
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,820
而且我就要结婚了呢
and that I'm about to get married?

402
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,590
那简直是世上最好的消息
I can't think of anything better.

403
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,930
要是我告诉你我的毕生至爱
And what if I told you the love of my life

404
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,820
就是这个男人呢
is this man standing right here?

405
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,880
难怪上帝要带给我们这场龙卷风
Then I'd know why god sent us this tornado.

406
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,850
该死
Damn.

407
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,640
最初的震惊之后  奶奶缓和了一些
After the initial shock, gram softened a bit.

408
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,530
她甚至同意参加婚礼了
She even agreed to attend the wedding.

409
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,060
举着牌子站在场外抗议
Standing outside with a sign.

410
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,460
慢慢来  米奇尔  慢慢来
Baby steps, Mitchell. Baby steps.

411
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,240
然后  天线就
And... our antenna is...

412
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,020
-重新连上了  -赞
- reattached. - Yes!

413
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,290
这没用啊
Oh, this is useless.

414
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,670
我不想听见这种话
Hey, I don't want to hear talk like that.

415
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,400
想鼓舞士气就想想阿波罗十三号
If you want inspiration, think about Apollo 13.

416
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,940
杰第一次组装这模型的时候也没有放弃
Jay didn't give up when he first put together this model.

417
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,970
这很难很复杂  而且那时候
It was hard and complicated, and back then,

418
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,840
说明书上的字也很小
the print on the instructions was tiny,

419
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,190
可他坚持下去了
but he persevered.

420
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:48,400
而且  真的阿波罗十三号上的宇航员
Also, the astronauts on the actual Apollo 13

421
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,580
身处险境时也没有放弃
didn't give up when their actual lives were in danger.

422
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,460
是的  但他们有很多人帮忙
Them, too, but they had a lot of other people helping them out.

423
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,700
我们只能靠自己
We're on our own here.

424
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,150
我知道我们需要什么东西
Okay, I figured out what we need

425
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,240
来重新组装这该死的着陆舱了
to reattach that damn landing module.

426
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,220
胶水不行
Glue won't work.

427
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,430
我们需要根非常细的长丝
We need a very thin filament--

428
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:02,050
比线还细的
thinner than thread.

429
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,380
我知道什么能行
I know what will work.

430
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,070
我得离开一下
Well, I need to go check on something.

431
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,610
我跟我的女伴说我去去就回
I told my date I'd be back in a jiff.

432
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,500
去去就回
Back in a jiff.

433
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,280
只能等了
Nothing to do but wait.

434
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,250
我们为何自己乱了阵脚  菲尔
Why are we making ourselves crazy, Phil?

435
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,910
不知道  我就是不想让杰失望
I don't know. I just hate disappointing Jay so much.

436
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,920
他的确不是容易取悦的人
He is not an easy guy to please.

437
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,510
我知道  可一旦成功就很幸福  是吧
I know, but when you do, it's pretty sweet, ain't it?

438
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,670
必须的
Sure is.

439
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,650
你很幸运有这么个老爸
You're lucky to have a dad like that.

440
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,470
很难不受伤啊  儿子
Hard not to be hurt by that, son.

441
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,810
我怎么以前没发现你喘气这么大声
How have I never noticed how loud you breathe?

442
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,560
别自责了  那需要你
Aw, don't beat yourself up-- that'd require you

443
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,100
注意到你自己以外的事情
to notice something that isn't about you.

444
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,590
天呐  你真失败
Oh, my god, you are such a loser!

445
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,730
我可不能整天跟你在一起
I can't be stuck to you all day!

446
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,290
够了  我听不下去了
Okay, that's it! I cannot listen to this anymore!

447
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,850
我要把你俩剪开
I'm going to cut you two out of there.

448
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,170
不  歌洛莉亚  我的头发
No! Gloria, no! My hair!

449
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,150
-太晚了  -好吧  剪我的就好
- Too late! - Okay, okay! Just cut mine.

450
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,300
没错  剪她的  等等  为什么
Yeah, cut hers! Wait. Why?

451
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,550
反正也没人关心我长什么样
No one cares what I look like, anyway.

452
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,080
你才不是真的这么想
You don't really think that.

453
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,220
多少有一点
Yeah, well, kind of.

454
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,260
你没看到查克看你的眼神吗
You didn't see the way that Chuck was looking at you?

455
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,970
等等  你真觉得我对你是个威胁吗
Wait, you actually think I'm a threat?

456
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,280
我不会说出来的
I'm not gonna say that out loud.

457
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,900
这真窝心
Aww, that's so sweet.

458
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,640
要是我有男朋友
Well, if I ever had a boyfriend,

459
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,880
我绝对不会让他和你独处五秒的
I wouldn't trust him with you for five seconds.

460
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,840
好了  结束吧
Okay. Let's finish this job.

461
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,910
歌洛莉亚  别  不能剪
Gloria, no, you can't cut--

462
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,600
搞定了
And there you go.

463
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,800
就这样  小菜一碟
That's it. That was easy.

464
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,260
你为什么等了一小时才这样做
Why did you wait an hour to do this?

465
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,420
你们为什么等了15年才那么做呢
Why did you wait 15 years to do that?

466
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,000
至少这样  大家的秀发
At least this way, nothing bad happened

467
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,490
都不会受损
to anyone's pretty hair.

468
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,870
女儿  我没听到你进来
Oh, honey. I didn't hear you come in.

469
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,330
-晚上过得如何  -这么说吧
- How was the rest of your night? - Let's see.

470
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,900
在你放了我鸽子之后
After you bailed on me,

471
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,410
衣柜乌托邦的马可一直冲我喋喋不休
Mark from Closetopia yakked my ear off,

472
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,450
还说我长得像海蒂・克鲁姆
and then told me I look like Heidi Klum,

473
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,220
这简直是赤裸裸的挑逗
which is such an obvious come-on.

474
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,370
马可是同性恋
Mark's gay.

475
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,100
这样的话  今晚糟透了
Well, in that case, my night stank.

476
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,400
我没有放你鸽子
And I didn't bail.

477
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,560
这里很多人跟我很熟  他们把我拉走的
I know a lot of people here. They pulled me away.

478
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
这睡袍棒极了
Hey, these robes are terrific.

479
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,710
衣柜里有你一件
You know, there's one for you in the closet.

480
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,510
你一定要穿上感受一下
You ought to put it on.

481
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,780
我不想穿浴袍
I don't want a robe.

482
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,480
爸  你今晚是不是在躲我
Dad, were you avoiding me tonight?

483
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,680
我为什么要躲你
Why would I avoid you?

484
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,220
相信我  柔软的像黄油一样
Trust me -- soft, like butter.

485
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,220
就在那里挂着
Right in there.

486
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,790
不要非让我问出口
Don't make me ask.

487
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,930
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

488
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,560
20年前你和丽塔
You and Rita 20 years ago --

489
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,300
-没什么  我都知道了  -天呐
- It's okay. I know. - Oh, geez.

490
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,370
我理解  这种事时有发生
I get it. Things happen.

491
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,470
-真的么  -事情过去很久了
- Really? - It was a long time ago.

492
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,660
好吧  感谢理解
Well, I appreciate it.

493
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,830
我只能说我并不以此为傲
I just want to say I'm not proud of it.

494
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,450
如果那时我能像现在这样了解他
If I had known him then like I know him now,

495
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,780
我绝不会试图把菲尔从你身边赶走
I never would have tried to get rid of Phil.

496
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,720
晚安
Good night.

497
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,530
把菲尔赶走  你在说什么
"Get rid of Phil"? What are you talking about?

498
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,470
你又在说什么
What are you talking about?

499
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,980
你和丽塔的婚外情
You and Rita had an affair.

500
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,590
不  我们没有  那也太离谱了
No, we didn't. That's crazy.

501
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,010
好吧  晚安
Well, okay, good night.

502
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,100
把菲尔赶走  你那么说是什么意思
"Get rid of phil" -- what does that even mean?

503
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,070
没什么意思  你们刚开始约会
It doesn't mean anything. You had just started dating.

504
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,610
你知道我一直不喜欢那个家伙
You know I was never hot on the guy.

505
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,850
我让丽塔在德克萨斯州
I told Rita to offer him

506
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,220
给他找了个销售职位
a sales job in Texas.

507
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,180
我记得  但那不是在我们约会的阶段
I remember that, but that wasn't when we were dating.

508
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,570
-我们都订婚了  -那不重要
- We were engaged. - Doesn't matter.

509
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,070
菲尔也没有接受那份工作
Phil didn't take the job anyway.

510
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,590
如果一定要说有什么后果
If anything, my little test

511
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,910
我的小测试证明了他有多爱你
proved how much he loved you.

512
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,210
不用客气  我们明早再谈
You're welcome. We'll talk in the morning.

513
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,370
你怎么能这样  还敢说"不用客气"
Oh, how dare you -- "You're welcom" please.

514
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,940
我无法和你共处一室了
Oh, I can't even be in the same room with you.

515
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,460
-我的外套在哪  -克莱尔
- Where is my coat? - Uh, Claire.

516
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,460
真是不敢相信
Ugh, unbelievable.

517
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,510
我不喜欢我的女婿
"I don't like my son-in-law,

518
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,220
所以我要把他打发到德克萨斯去
so I'm gonna ship him off to Texas."

519
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,390
爸  你这样处理问题真"成熟"
Real mature way to deal with your problems, dad.

520
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,790
-我明白你的意思  -是啊  真成熟
- I get that point. - Yeah. Real mature.

521
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,660
-这样整人也很成熟  -这是传统
- That's real mature, too. - That's tradition.

522
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,590
-那是个骷髅  -在衣橱里  我知道
- It's the skeleton... - In the closet. Oh, I get it.

523
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,590
[skeleton in the closet: 见不得光的秘密]

524
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,690
我非常抱歉  但在你冲出去之前
I'm really sorry, but before you go storming out of here,

525
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,760
你想不想谈谈几年前我接到的
you want to talk about a certain phone call I got

526
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,690
一通移民局打来的电话
from immigration a few years ago?

527
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,570
那时我刚开始和歌洛莉亚约会
I had just started dating Gloria.

528
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,180
他们说有人匿名举报
They were acting on an anonymous tip.

529
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,340
时候不早了
It's very late.

530
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,410
明天还有不少事要做
We have a very big day tomorrow.

531
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,730
克莱尔  我现在越来越喜欢菲尔了
You know, Claire, I've really come to like Phil.

532
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,660
我知道
I know.

533
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,450
而且讽刺的是
And the irony is,

534
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,690
他会很喜欢这个骷髅的梗
he would really love that skeleton gag.

535
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,910
你可以在他身上试试
Try it out on him. You got

536
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,370
明年的会议之前骷髅由你来保管
to take care of that thing till next year.

537
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:44,370
天哪
Oh, god.

538
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,730
等等  在你关灯之前
Wait, before you turn that out,

539
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,750
我们得确认一下没什么需要谈的了吧
have we talked about everything we need to?

540
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,430
因为我想把一切都说开
'cause I want everything out in the clear here.

541
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,910
是的  没有了
Yeah. We have.

542
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,300
晚安
Good night.

543
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,030
大概15年前我确实和丽塔亲热过一次
I did make out with Rita once about 15 years ago.

544
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,100
晚安
Good night.

545
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,000
好
Okay.

546
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,420
剩下的就是
All that's left...

547
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,710
要把着陆舱连接到驾驶舱上
is to reattach the lander to the command module.

548
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,250
我们只有一次机会  伙计们
We got one shot at this, fellas.

549
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,530
如果失败了 杰一回到家就会发疯的  对吧
If we fail, jay's gonna burn up on re-entry into this house. Am I right?

550
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,670
一次搞定  儿子
Hole in one, son!

551
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,630
谢谢  老爸
Thanks, dad.

552
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,990
孩子们  如果这事搞砸了
Boys, if this thing goes sideways,

553
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,580
我不想你们亲眼看到
I don't want you to be here to see it.

554
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,410
-所以快走  -但爸爸
- So go on. - But, dad --

555
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,580
不  听我的
No, you listen to me!

556
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,100
好的  菲尔
Okay, Phil.

557
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,110
好吧  菲利普
Okay, Philip.

558
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,690
稳一点
Steady.

559
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,780
他要开始了
He's locked in.

560
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,220
现在不是紧张的时候
Not now, nerves.

561
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,930
稳住
Hold.

562
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,370
稳住
Hold.

563
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,080
当个英雄
Be a hero.

564
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,090
带她回家
Bring her home.

565
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,140
我看我还是打车走吧
I guess I'll call a cab.

566
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,320
再见  珍宁
So long, Jeanine.

567
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,250
难道  这是
Is it? Is --

568
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,030
完成了
It is!

569
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,510
成功溅落
Splashdown!

570
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,930
狗娘养的  他成功了
Son of a bitch, he did it.

571
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,780
歌洛莉亚  快来
Yeah! Gloria, get in here!

572
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,760
快来
There we go!

573
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,210
-爸  你成功了  -是啊  成功了
- Dad, you did it! - Yes, I did!

574
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,850
太棒了  太棒了
I love it! I love it!

575
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,840
太棒了
I love it!

576
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,840
菲尔  亲爱的  快上床
Phil, honey. Come to bed.

577
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,140
这浴袍滑的像黄油一样
This robe feels like butter.

578
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,450
太怀念了  亲爱的
I missed this, honey.

579
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,110
这瑜伽课可真是物超所值啊
That yoga's really paying off.

580
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,590
悠着点  宝贝
Hey, whoa. Slow down, baby.

581
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,800
发动机可还没烧热呢
You can't gun a cold engine.

582
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,240
但如果你...那床上的是...
But if you're -- then who's --

583
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,370
你什么时候发现的
When did you know?

584
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,170
它没有抱怨我穿着袜子
When it didn't complain about my socks.

585
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,150
你检查过衣橱了  是不是
You checked the closet, didn't you?

586
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,610
每晚睡前都会检查
Every night before bed.

587
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,900
我真的不懂  这好傻
I really don't understand it. It's so silly.

588
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,470
我是说  如果真的有人想杀你
I mean, if somebody really wanted to kill you,

589
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,790
很明显他们会藏在床下
