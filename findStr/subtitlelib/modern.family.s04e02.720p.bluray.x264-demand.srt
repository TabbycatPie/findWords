I'm just saying, it's difficult to grow up

134

No, it's--it's a good thing. Come on.

151
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,570
糟了  她忘了拿零食
Oh, you know what? She forgot her snack. Oh.

152
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,970
她去哪儿了
Where'd she go?

153
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,710
好疼  好疼
Ow! That hurts! Ow! That hurts!

154
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,670
莉莉宝贝
Oh, Lily, honey!

155
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,600
宝贝  过来  快过来
Sweetheart, come here. Come here.

156
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,790
你再把你那小脏手伸向我女儿
If you ever put your hands on my daughter again,

157
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,420
我就把你倒栽葱挂在旗杆上
I will string you up by your feet, run you up the flagpole,

158
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,180
让鸟活生生啄出你的眼珠子来
and let the birds peck out your eyes.

159
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,970
你听懂了吗
You understand?

160
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,500
塔克先生  把那孩子放下来
Mr. Tucker, put that boy down!

161
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,740
他拉了我女儿的头发
He pulled my daughter's hair.

162
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,470
请你向康纳道歉
Please apologize to Connor

163
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,710
因为你动了手  而非动口
for using your hands instead of your words.

164
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,690
对不起了  小家伙
Sorry, little fella.

165
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,660
请你们到我办公室来
I would like to see you in my office. Right.

166
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,540
-现在就来  -我也要去吗
- Now, please. - Me, too? Oh.

167
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,410
够了  别惹他了
Stop it. Leave him alone.

168
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,780
塔克先生  刚才的事是不可接受的
Mr. Tucker, what happened out there was unacceptable.

169
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,220
我同意  这是幼儿园还是饥饿游戏啊
I agree. Is this kindergarten or "The hunger games"?

170
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,070
我说的是你的行为
I'm speaking of your behavior.

171
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,620
我们从没遇到这种事
We've never had an incident like this,

172
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,220
现在开学第一天就发生了
and now we've had one on the first day,

173
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,550
还没到班级集合时间呢
Before circle time.

174
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,310
你们到底在想什么
What the fudge were you thinking?

175
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,510
现在这孩子的家长也来了  相信我
Now the boy's parents are coming in, and trust me,

176
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,940
她们简直是愤怒的凯蒂猫
they're mad as hello kitty.

177
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,910
你向他家长告状啦
Oh, you told his parents on us?

178
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
这实在  太不够意思了
That is--that is so not cool.

179
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,520
我相信一旦他们听到自己儿子的所为
Well, I'm sure once they hear what their boy did,

180
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,970
他们也会理解的
they will be understanding.

181
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,700
哪个吃了雄心豹子胆
All right, whoever made our son cry

182
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,430
敢惹我们家宝贝儿子
has messed with the wrong moms.

183
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,450
拉拉们
Lesbians.

184
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,450
虽然基佬和拉拉常被人扯在一起
While often lumped together, gay men and lesbians

185
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,490
但实际我们之间并没有什么交集
have less in common than one might think.

186
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,330
就好比性别认同的交集图
Like in the Venn Diagram of sexual identity,

187
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,710
我是基佬
You have gay men...

188
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,880
我是直男
And straight men.

189
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,190
我们性别一样
Both the same gender.

190
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,110
我是基佬
Then you have gay men...

191
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,610
我是直女
And straight women.

192
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,020
我们都爱男人
Both attracted to the same gender.

193
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,230
可基佬和拉拉们呢
But gay men and lesbians?

194
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,130
不行
No.

195
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,130
毫无交集
Nothing.

196
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,940
抱歉以这种方式和你们见面
I am so sorry we have to meet like this,

197
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,720
但我想同为家长  你们可以理解
but I'm sure you can understand, as parents,

198
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,810
保护自己孩子的那种本能
the instinct to protect your child.

199
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,640
是啊  所以我想一拳狠狠砸在你脖子上
Yeah, it's what makes me want to punch you in the neck right now.

200
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,910
哇  我终于明白你儿子的暴力倾向源自何处了
Wow. I see where your son gets all of his aggression.

201
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,880
好了  二位都消消火吧
Okay, let's all take a time-out.

202
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,730
真是个好主意  战火烧得有点大
That's a good idea. This is getting a little heated.

203
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,460
是啊  帕姆  
Yeah, Pam,

204
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,930
别又闹出上次在木材场那样的事故
we don't want another incident like at the lumberyard.

205
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,650
天啊  你们也去木材场啊  
Oh, my god. You guys go to the lumberyard, too? D--

206
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,610
我不知道那儿也办"女士之夜"呢
I didn't know they had a ladies' night.

207
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,210
不是说"木材场酒吧"  蠢蛋
Not the bar, sally.

208
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,240
其实  他是想友善示好
Okay, you know what? He's trying to be nice,

209
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,530
你却叫他蠢蛋
And you just called him "Sally."

210
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,640
是啊  你简直是越帮越乱  小甜心
Yeah, you're not being very helpful, peppermint patty.

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,310
好吧  我们就叫真名好吗
Okay. Let's just stick to our actual names.

212
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,710
够了
Enough.

213
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,940
我要给你们分配一项家庭作业
I'm gonna give you a little homework assignment.

214
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,870
我希望你们和孩子们一起来个家庭欢聚会
I want you and your kids to have a family playdate.

215
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,260
如果你们四个可以和睦相处
Maybe if the four of you can get along,

216
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,570
也可以为孩子们树立个好榜样
You can set a better example for your children.

217
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,850
我觉得那是个好主意  帕姆
I think that's a wonderful idea. Pam?

218
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,950
-好吧  -小卡
- Fine. - Cam?

219
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,830
好吧  不过显然是由我们来主持
Fine. We'll host, obviously.

220
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,700
"显然"吗
"Obviously"?

221
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,270
我猜想你们家一定还有木工活没做完吧
I assume you have an unfinished woodworking project at your house.

222
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,570
你真是胆大  出言放肆
You've got a lot of nerve.

223
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,710
是啊  你做了半个独木舟还在我们家客厅里呢
Yeah, and you've got half a canoe in our living room.

224
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,140
我很期待尝尝你们做的馅饼
I look forward to your frittata.

225
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,530
那么老套的东西  你当现在是2008年啊
Oh. Why, are you visiting us in 2008?

226
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,720
老天啊
Oh, my god.

227
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,060
你得好好解释一下为什么生个黑娃了
You have some explaining to do.

228
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,190
我很抱歉娃出生了你才发现我的奸情  杰
I'm so sorry that you had to find out like this, Jay.

229
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,350
哇  你肚子那么大了  怀孕挺久了吧
Wow, you two are really far along.

230
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,700
我们才刚刚处于怀孕前三个月
We're, uh, we're still in our first trimester.

231
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,930
真好
Ay, that's nice.

232
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,000
是啊  我们多年来一直都在努力生个孩子
Yeah, we've been trying to get pregnant for ages.

233
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,250
她是拉丁人  做个鬼脸笑笑都能怀孕
She's Latina. You just gotta look at her funny.

234
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,720
好了  现在大家手上都有娃娃了
Okay, now that everyone has their doll,

235
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,700
我们先来讲一下怎么包孩子
Let's talk about swaddling.

236
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,450
首先  你们要把毯子的一角
Now you want to start by turning one corner of the blanket

237
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,390
折向自己  折个菱形
toward you, like a diamond,

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,490
从上面折起来
And folding the top down,

239
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,410
就像这样
Like this.

240
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,370
我觉得医院把我们的孩子搞错了
I think they made a mistake at the hospital.

241
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,800
全教室的人都没笑点
Tough room.

242
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,140
然后将另外一个角折过来
Now we are going to pull the other corner 'round,

243
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,890
整齐服帖地掖到一起
And tuck it in nice and snug

244
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,280
就像玉米煎饼一样
Like a burrito.

245
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,450
完成  我胜了
Done! I win.

246
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,900
这不是比赛
It's not a race.

247
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,550
你说得太对了  跟比赛差远了
You're darn right. It wasn't even close.

248
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,140
好吧  你包得不错  但有点太紧了
Okay, it's good, but it's a little tight.

249
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,880
是你说玉米煎饼的啊  不能让里面的肉掉出来
It's a burrito. You don't want the meat to fall out.

250
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,940
看着  像这样
Here. And try like this.

251
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,740
瞧见了吗
And see?

252
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,860
现在你们的宝宝可以呼吸了
Now your baby can breathe.

253
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:35,620
我一手开车  一手都能将我儿子包好
I wrapped my son with one hand while driving a stick.

254
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,680
我很清楚该怎样保证宝宝的安全
I think I know how to keep a baby safe.

255
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,410
天啊  我真喜欢重归宿舍的感觉
Man, I love being back in the dorms.

256
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,890
就像我从未离开过
It's like I never left.

257
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,360
贴张大卫・科波菲尔的海报  
Throw up a David Copperfield poster,

258
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,580
简直就跟我的宿舍一模一样
this could be my room.

259
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,430
亲爱的  我陪海莉去填一些文件
Honey, Haley and I have to go fill out some paperwork.

260
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,970
你就把亚麻衣服放床上吧
Why don't you throw the linens on the bed?

261
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,220
-然后把车挪个位置  别被拖走了  -好
- Oh, and move the car before they tow us. - Okay.

262
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,790
老天啊  你那T恤是怎么回事
Oh, my god. What is that shirt?!

263
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,330
超有爱的吧  海莉・邓菲搬家公司
Pretty sweet, huh? "Haley Dunphy moving co."

264
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,610
因为我们要把你"搬"到这里  上面也是
'cause we're moving you here and here.

265
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,050
还有...
And also...

266
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,030
心里
Here.

267
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,800
女儿  以前你可喜欢拉着我们的手荡秋千了
Man, you used to love it when we swung you like that.

268
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,600
我觉得现在还是可以做的吧
I bet we could still do it.

269
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,990
-是啊  -是啊
- Yeah! - Yeah.

270
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,210
噢不不不不
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

271
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,990
你们敢来拉我  还有  赶快把那衣服脱了
Don't you dare pick me up! And take that shirt off.

272
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,200
-什么  为什么  -多有爱啊
- What? Why? - It's cute!

273
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,550
一点都没有爱  你没看见现在的状况吗
It's not cute! Do you see what's happening out there?

274
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,730
大家都转来转去互相吐槽鄙视
People are walking around and judging each other.

275
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,860
不  才没有呢
No, they're not.

276
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,450
是吗
Oh, really?

277
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,040
你们没看见
You didn't see the way

278
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,490
大厅对面向我投来的各种淫邪眼光吗
muffin top across the hall was looking at me?

279
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,120
大学生的嘴是很恶毒的  赶紧脱下来
People can be cruel. So take it off.

280
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,590
好吧
Fine.

281
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,290
天啊  快把衣服穿上
Oh, my god! Put on a shirt!

282
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,230
我不知道你到底想让我搞哪样
I don't know what you want from me!

283
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,850
第一印象一旦定下就无法更改
"You only get one chance at a first impression.

284
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,200
我建议模仿厨神茱莉亚  因为那很简单
I suggest Julia Child, because it's easy to do."

285
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,840
"留着内脏别扔"
"Save the giblets."

286
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,620
该去沙滩了
Time to go to the beach!

287
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,560
你想带着狗去沙滩吗
You're gonna go to the beach with a dog?

288
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:50,780
我真不知道我干了什么好事
I don't know what I did

289
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,420
-得到这样一个好孩子  -是啊
- to deserve this. - Yeah.

290
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,530
我想带康纳去看我的玩具
I want to show Connor my toys.

291
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,140
好啊  去吧  宝贝
Oh, okay. You do that, sweetie.

292
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,160
嘿  康纳  别再扯人家头发了
Hey, Connor, uh, no hair pulling.

293
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,610
谢谢你
Thank you for that.

294
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,620
好了  我做了各种春卷
Okay, we have an assortment of spring rolls here.

295
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,010
都是素馅的  当然了
All vegetarian, of course.

296
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,870
因为我是拉拉  我就肯定是个素食主义者吗
Oh, 'cause I'm a lesbian, I'm automatically a vegetarian?

297
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:08,980
我在《拉字至上》那部剧中看到的
Well, I saw it on "The L word."

298
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,440
人家编剧也不是乱编的吧
I assume they have consultants.

299
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,210
我想说  那是世人对拉拉冒犯性的刻板印象
I'm just saying it's an offensive stereotype.

300
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,880
够了  帕姆  你确实是素食主义者啊
Okay, Pam, you are a vegetarian.

301
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,520
别装了吧
Knock it off.

302
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,440
碰对了
Worked out.

303
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,000
是啊  真高兴我们可以这样和睦地相处

305
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,900
我们是班里唯一的同性恋家长
I mean, we're the only gay parents in the class.

306
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,430
是啊  我们该互相支持才对
Yeah, we should be supporting one another.

307
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,260
我是说  我们有那么多共同点
I mean, we have so much in common.

308
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,340
就是啊
Exactly.

309
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,880
所以
So...

310
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,230
介绍一下你们自己吧
Tell us about yourselves.

311

Uh, and I'm a homemaker.

313
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,220
你  你们是干什么的
And--and, uh, and what do you do?

314
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,060
我是个理财顾问
I'm a financial consultant.

315
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,420
我是个承包商
I'm a contractor.

316
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,310
你以为我是个体育老师吗
You thought I was a P.E. teacher?

317
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,400
猜的
Well, figured.

318
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,460
我有个小问题要问
Hey, I have a question real quick.

319
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,530
你们是怎么把儿童座椅绑上摩托车的
How do you guys get the car seat on the motorcycle?

320
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,010
话说  康纳的生日会就在下周
Uh, you know, Connor is having a birthday next week.

321
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,320
不知道莉莉愿不愿意去
Maybe Lily would like to come.

322
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,510
她一定非常乐意
Oh, she would love that.

323
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,080
真好  你们要请小丑吗
Oh, great. Are you guys having a clown?

324
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,290
天啊  当然不要
Oh, god, no.

325
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,450
我最讨厌小丑了  慎得慌
I hate clowns they're so creepy.

326
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,750
你不喜欢  或许是因为他们会化妆吧
Maybe you just don't like them because they wear makeup.

327
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,230
算了  我走了
You know what? I'm out.

328
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,210
-好吧  -帕姆
- Okay. - Pam.

329
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,240
康纳  我们要走了
Connor, we're leaving!

330
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,720
-你误会了  -帕姆  帕姆
- You--you don't understand. - Pam! Pam!

331
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,670
小卡曾经是个小丑
Cam used to be a clown.

332
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,200
曾经吗  一日为小丑  终身为小丑
"Used to be"? Once a clown, always a clown.

333
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,000
天啊  别现在发作  别挑现在
God! Not now! Not now!

334
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,520
康纳  我们走了
Connor, let's go.

335
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,550
帕姆
Pam.

336
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,270
为什么门是锁着的
Why is this door locked?

337
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,640
过来  让我来
Here. Let me, please.

338
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,340
莉莉  立刻把门打开
Lily, open this door right now.

339
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,220
好吧  里面一点声音都没有
Okay. I'm not hearing anything.

340
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,410
我确定他们平安无事的
I'm sure they're fine.

341
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,810
你怎么确定的
Oh, how are you sure?

342
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,570
康纳
Connor!

343
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,910
-莉莉  -康纳
- Lily! - Connor!

344
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,990
莉莉
Lily!

345
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,850
将水温调到舒适的温度
Make the water comfortably warm

346
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,270
最多90-100华氏度
90 to 100 degrees max.

347
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,290
千万别将宝宝一个人放在澡盆里
And never leave the tub unsupervised.

348
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,210
你们有什么好笑的事要跟全班人分享一下吗
Is there something you two want to share with the class?

349
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,780
没有  是下流的笑话
No. It's dirty.

350
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,910
不好意思  你们不学我们还想学呢
Excuse me. We're trying to learn here.

351
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:06,880
别太担心  宝宝们是很强悍的
Don't worry so much. Babies are tougher than you think.

352
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,880
我5岁的时候  我的保姆是只山羊
When I was 5 years old, my babysitter was a goat.

353
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,770
什么
What?

354
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,550
别惊讶  我跟你说过洛佩的啊
Ay, please. You know about Lupe.

355
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,700
你从来没说她是只山羊
You never said she was a goat.

356
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,870
其实  班里能有一对
You know, it's great that we have

357
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,030
有经验的父母是件好事
a couple of experienced parents in the class.

358
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,600
或许你们可以和大家分享一下你们的育儿经
Perhaps you can share some of your wisdom with the rest of us.

359
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,460
必须的  又不是造火箭那种高科技
Absolutely. It's not rocket science.

360
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,220
不就是宝宝嘛  饿了  你就喂
It's babies. They're hungry, you feed 'em.

361
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,760
他们出牙的时候  就喂他们喝苏格兰酒
They're teething, you give 'em some scotch.

362
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,320
苏格兰酒
Scotch?

363
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,930
真的吗  当真吗
Really? Are you serious?

364
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:29,970
怎么了
What?

365
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,560
然后我们就离开了
So we left.

366
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,720
我可不需要那个人来教导我
I didn't need a lecture from Mary Poppins.

367
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,680
而我突然想去吃玉米煎饼了
And I was suddenly in a mood for a burrito.

368
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,520
请允许我"进入"你学生般的娇嫩身体
I'd like admission to your student body.

369
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,350
噢  老天啊
Oh, my goodness!

370
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,050
我很抱歉  我以为你是我妻子
I am so sorry. I thought you were my wife.

371
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:49,880
发生什么事了
What's going on?

372
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,480
他抓了我  而且说
He grabbed me and said--

373
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,410
我以为你是我老婆  我老婆经常健身的
I thought she was my wife. My wife works out a lot.

374
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,490
老爸
Dad?

375
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,450
他怎么抓你的
How'd he grab you?

376
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,380
他捏了我的屁股
He squeezed my butt.

377
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,150
他什么
He what?

378
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,770
-菲尔  -我以为那是你
- Phil! - I thought it was you!

379
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,070
相信我  先生  我是个受人尊敬的房产中介
Believe me, sir. I'm a respected realtor.

380
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,160
我绝对是无心之过
This is an innocent mistake.

381
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,910
亲爱的  转过去  让他看看你的屁股
Honey, turn around and show him your--your butt.

382
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,470
-简直让人不可思议  -爸
- It--it's uncanny. - Dad.

383
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,170
我很正常的  千万别认为上梁不正下梁歪
I am very normal. Please do not judge me based on them.

384
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,800
那是你的小马床单吗
Are those your my little pony sheets?

385
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,110
什么  不
What? No!

386
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,010
我在网上淘的
I ordered them online.

387
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,310
肯定是发错了图案  非常抱歉
They must've sent the wrong ones. I'm very sorry.

388
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:16,730
直接从箱子里拿出来的
That's what was in the box.

389
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,780
好吧
Okay.

390
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,850
我澄清下  我是个受人尊敬的房产中介
Uh, for the record, I am a respected realtor.

391
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,680
那些不是我的安全套
Those are not my condoms.

392
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,190
她买的
She bought 'em.

393
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,260
我的天
Oh, my god.

394
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,900
很显然  如今的家长就会这么做
Apparently, that's what people do these days--

395
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,340
给自己的孩子买安全套
Buy condoms for their kids.

396
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,310
我上大学的时候
When I went to college,

397
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,780
我爸妈给我买的是单车安全头盔
my parents bought me a bicycle helmet.

398
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,040
那是他们对安全的概念
That was their idea of safety.

399
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,440
显然不需要安全套
Certainly didn't need condoms.

400
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,290
你戴着单车安全头盔
Mm, not if you were wearing

401
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,170
在校园里溜达当然用不上安全套了  对吗
a bike helmet around campus, you didn't. Am I right?

402
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,400
你们先收拾好吧
Why don't we let you guys finish,

403
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,620
我们等下再来
and we'll come back later?

404
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,080
好的
Okay.

405
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,630
就这样
Yeah.

406
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,920
好
Yep.

407
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,090
好  这主意好
Yeah, that sounds good.

408
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,900
周末家长活动时见啦
See you on parents weekend!

409
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,390
他们看起来不错哦
They seem nice.

410
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,800
-爸妈  我  -我知道  我知道
- Guys, I-- - I know. I know.

411
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,300
我们需要重新整理下
Look, we need to reorganize a little.

412
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,400
你爸出去买新的床单
Your dad will go out and get us some new sheets.

413
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,550
我们可以把照片挂在墙上
You and I can hang up all the pictures on the walls.

414
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,130
知道吗  我觉得你们最好还是离开
You know what? I think it's best if you guys get going.

415
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,630
但我们想帮你  亲爱的
But we--we wanted to help you, sweetie.

416
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,340
不  我可以的
No, I got it.

417
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,540
如果你想把家具挪个地方呢
W-what if you wanna move the furniture around?

418
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,510
我们想在离开前带你去吃晚餐
And we were gonna take you to dinner before we left.

419
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,030
我喜欢家具现在的摆放位置  而且我也不饿
I like the furniture where it is, and I'm not hungry.

420
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,050
所以...
So...

421
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,480
-好的  -好吧
- Okay. - Okay.

422
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,770
那个  在我们离开前
Um, well, uh, before we leave,

423
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,290
我要送你一样小礼物
I wanted to give you a little present.

424
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,680
其实不是什么小礼物
It's actually not a little present.

425
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,010
有可能是你这辈子收到的最好礼物
It's probably the best present you're ever gonna get.

426
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,870
-这是我的人生感悟精选集  -多谢
- It's a collection of all the things I've learned-- - Thanks.

427
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,360

429
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,270

436
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,390
作为人来说可以遇到的最美妙的事情
"The most amazing things that can happen to a human being

437
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,680
你也会遇到

438
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,220
只要你降低期望值
if you just lower your expectations."

439
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,330
他们把锁孔也挡住了
Oh, they've got something over the hole.

440
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,000
-莉莉  -康纳

441
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,650
从外面什么也看不见
We can't see anything from outside.

442
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,960
窗帘关上了
The curtains are closed.

443
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,470
开门  康纳  开门了就给你吃热狗
Open up, Connor! We'll let you have a hot dog!

444
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,110
如果他们出了事怎么办
What if something happened to them?

445
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,730
里面有没有什么危险物品
What kind of hazards do you keep in there?

446
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,530
我想想  我们在里面放着枪支收藏
Well, let's see. That's where we keep our gun collection,

447
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,730
我们家的废弃冰箱
our abandoned refrigerator,

448
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,190
还有涂满巧克力的皮下注射针
and our chocolate-covered hypodermic needles.

449
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,920
为什么基佬说话总是冷嘲热讽的
Why are gay men always so sarcastic?

450
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,040
那是我的应对机制
It's my coping mechanism!

451
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,170
够了
Okay, that's it!

452
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,520
莉莉  康纳  如果你们能听到
Lily, Connor, if you can hear me,

453
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,000
离门远一点  我要撞门了
back away from the door. I'm gonna break it down.

454
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:22,590
我来帮你
I'll help you.

455
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,660
我不要康纳走
I don't want Connor to go!

456
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,110
我要留下
I wanna stay!

457
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,640
谢天谢地他们还活着
Oh, thank god they're alive!

458
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,730
我爱他
I love him!

459
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,830
不  你只是喜欢这个想法  快开门  宝贝
No, you love the idea of him. Now open this door, sweetie.

460
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,380
我们真的可以吃热狗吗
Can we really have hot dogs?

461
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,610
是的  我保证
Yes, we promise.

462
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,170
快过来  小甜心
Oh! Come here, sweetheart.

463
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,740
要我说
If you ask me...

464
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,410
有时候我们太过关注我们的差异
Sometimes we get so hang up on our differences.

465
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,370
我们忘记了彼此最大的共同点
We forget there's one thing that we have in common.

466
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,230
当涉及到我们孩子的安全与幸福时
When it comes to the safety and well-being of our children,

467
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,320
我们都会抓狂
we're all a little bit nuts.

468
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,510
你的纤纤小玉手和你的女儿一样
You have dainty little hands, just like your daughter.

469
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,050
你的大脚丫子跟我爸一样
You have boots like my dad.

470
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,800
我又没说那只山羊哄我睡觉给我刷牙
I'm not saying that the goat put me to sleep or brushed my teeth.

471
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,110
它只是待在我的卧室窗户外面
It just stayed outside my bedroom window

472
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,810
吓跑所有的陌生人
and scared all the strangers away.

473
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,790
我不打算说谎  我有点失望
Well, I'm not gonna lie. I'm a little disappointed.

474
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,900
嘿  孩子
Hey, kid!

475
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,420
杰  妈  课上得怎么样
Jay, mom, how was class?

476
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,330
非常棒  非常有教育意义
It was great. It was very educating and--

477
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,740
现在我们了解了关于宝宝的一切  对吗
And now we know everything about the baby, no?

478
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,090
有意思  因为你们的老师打电话来
Interesting, because your teacher called,

479
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,110
你离开时忘了拿太阳镜
and you forgot your sunglasses when you left...

480
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,680
三小时之前
Three hours early.

481
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,240
曼尼  别生气
Ay, Manny, don't be mad.

482
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,740
我没生气  只是失望而已
I'm not mad. Just disappointed.

483
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,640
我讨厌这样  他尖叫我还好受些  
I hate this. I prefer when he screams.

484
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,180
曼尼  没什么大不了的
Manny, it's no big deal.

485
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,540
他们教的我们都已经知道了
They weren't telling us anything we didn't already know.

486
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,870
马上就有宝宝要出世了
We're going to have a baby.

487
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,460
难道只有我一个人害怕吗
Am I the only one who's terrified?

488
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,690
为什么呢
But why?

489
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,360
你为什么这么害怕呢
Why are you so terrified?

490
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,200
如果宝宝不知道不该拿刀
What if it doesn't know not to pick up knives

491
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,050
或是把手指插进了电插孔怎么办
or stick its finger in an electric socket?

492
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,660
你是个很马虎的人  妈
You were pretty lax, mom.

493
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,820
是我告诉你
I was the one who told you

494
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,260
把水壶手柄转向炉子
to turn the pot handles towards the stove

495
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,230
这样我就够不着了
so I couldn't reach them.

496
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,070
曼尼  我不操心这些事情
Manny, I didn't worry about those things

497
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,370
因为有你替我们两个操心
because you worried for the both of us.

498
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,620
如果这个宝宝考虑事情不周全呢
What if this baby doesn't think things through?

499
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,540
有杰的遗传在里面
It's part Jay.

500
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,750
就当你没伤到我吧
No offense taken.

501
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,030
如果宝宝和你不一样  那我们的表现也会不一样
If the baby's different, we'll be different.

502
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,530
听我说
Hey.

503
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,410
你成长的时候
When you were growing up,

504
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,710
必须身兼家里的顶梁柱与小孩两个角色
you had to be the man of the house and the kid.

505
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,960
现在有我  你只要做小孩就行了
Now I'm here. You just have to be the kid.

506
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,470
我不会让宝宝出任何事
I'm not gonna let anything happen to the baby,

507
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,720
就好像我永远不会让你出任何事一样
just like I'm not ever gonna let anything happen to you.

508
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,700
好吗
Okay?

509
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,220
好吧  真是松了口气
Okay. That is a load off.

510
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,500
不过上周探戈课结束后  你们可是忘了接我
Although you forgot to pick me up last week after tango class.

511
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,900
我们没忘  我们只是迟了十分钟
We didn't forget. We were just ten minutes late.

512
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,830
在不安全社区十分钟可是一段漫长的时间
Ten minutes is a long time in a sketchy neighborhood.

513
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,190
得了  教室旁边是"金宝贝早教中心"
Please. It was between a gymboree

514
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,490
和"陶瓷大谷仓"
and a pottery barn.

515
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,830

518
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,520
你怎么样  还好吗
How you doing? Are you okay?

519
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,720
还好  我...
Yeah. No, I'm...

520
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,550
我很好  你呢
I'm--I'm--I'm good. You?

521

很好
Great.

要有鹦鹉学舌的精神
"Take a lesson from parakeets.

524

如果你感觉孤单
If you're ever feeling lonely,

525
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,360
就在镜子前吃饭吧
Just eat in front of a mirror."

526
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,430
永远不要害怕摘星星
"Never be afraid to reach for the stars,

527

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,420
你永远有"父母牌降落伞"防身
