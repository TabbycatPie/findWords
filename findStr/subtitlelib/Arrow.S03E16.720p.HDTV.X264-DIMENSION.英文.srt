7
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,490
My name is Oliver Queen.

8
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,120
After five years in hell,

9
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,150
I have come home with only one goal--

10
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,050
to save my city.

11
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,270
Now others have joined my crusade.

12
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,800
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

13
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,260
To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.

14
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,340
I am...something else.

15
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,630
Previously, on "Arrow"...

16
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,990
I killed Sara.

17
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,100
Malcolm gave me something that made me

18
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,450
susceptible to suggestion.

19
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,190
What happened wasn't your fault, Thea,

20
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,940
because it wasn't your decision.

21
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,420
Malcolm? He's going to face justice.

22
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,830
He's gone. Malcolm Merlyn will never be seen again.

23
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,530
Welcome to Nanda Parbat.

24
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,980
When I told you that Malcolm killed Sara,

25
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,580
he wanted her dead, but I am the one

26
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,790
who fired those arrows into her chest.

27
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,900
I promised you your vengeance.

28
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,220
So take it.

29
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,550
Kill me.

30
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,060
But spare John Diggle's life.

31
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,690
Let him go.

32
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,570
I will beg for it.

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,760
You've shown tremendous strength,

34
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,030
fortitude,

35
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,850
and power.

36
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,730
No, Mr. Queen...

37
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,490
I don't want to kill you.

38
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,570
I want you to take my place.

39
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,090
I want you to become the next Ra's Al Ghul.

40
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,390
Ra's is a title greater than any one man.

41
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,680
Wing ta lao wo chey.

42
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,720
Am I supposed to understand what that means?

43
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,370
No. It is from a dialect no longer spoken.

44
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,970
Said to me by a man whose place I took.

45
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,750
Contemplating the same offer.

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,340
And what it means is,

47
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,210
A tale to be told...

48
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,330
begins thus.

49
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,570
Don't let your footing betray you.

50
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,000
Let your power come not from the strength of your attack

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,920
but from the ground that holds your feet.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,140
All men seek guidance, a purpose,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,170
the means to live without pain.

54
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,540
Those who journey here have given such an exchange

55
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,900
for their fealty.

56
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,270
You mean they have to kill for you?

57
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,640
No, Mr. Queen, they have to die for me.

58
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,430
Is all of this supposed to impress me?

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,710
No.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,040
It's to inform you.

61
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,110
Surely men have branded you a murderer,

62
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,130
a torturer.

63
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,010
But see, I would never shame you with such bluntness.

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,840
Because I see it in your eyes.

65
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,480
The struggle you have with your dual identity.

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,310
Oliver Queen and the Arrow.

67
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,060
Neither are giving you what you crave.

68
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,480
But becoming Ra's Al Ghul will?

69
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,630
Oliver Queen is a man destined to be alone.

70
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,510
He loves a woman he knows he cannot have.

71
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,630
You don't know me.

72
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,150
But I know the Arrow.

73
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,050
"Al Sahhim." You will never be

74
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,360
anything more than a vigilante for those whose lives you save

75
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,920
at the risk of your own.

76
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,370
And the city will turn on you,

77
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,450
and your closest allies within the police department

78
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,160
will call you a criminal.

79
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,680
You will be scorned

80
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,660
and hunted,

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,420
and then killed.

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,590
Dying as you began your crusade...

83
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,610
alone.

84
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,010
Your brother attempted to have me believe that he killed Sara.

85
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,930
Your confession is even less convincing.

86
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,410
I don't have any reason to lie!

87
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,760
Except to protect your father.

88
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,170
Why would I protect Malcolm

89
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,000
when I turned him over to you?

90
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,850
He gave me a drug called Votura.

91
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:06,990
I put three arrows into her chest,

92
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,120
and I had no idea what I was doing.

93
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,430
He used me.

94
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,870
Someone she trusted.

95
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,160
So I don't deserve to be living

96
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,140
any more than Malcolm does!

97
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,770
There would be no justice in killing you.

98
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,230
I killed Sara!

99
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,240
Kill me.

100
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,620
Do it.

101
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,430
Do it.

102
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,060
The blood debt ends with Malcolm's death.

103
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,950
Which, I can assure you, my father has taken care of already.

104
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,690
Thea!

105
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,640
Get away from her!

106
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,340
Nyssa, no!

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,970
Are you ok?

108
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,240
How the hell...

109
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,020
did she get out?

110
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,440
It's League training, probably.

111
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,220
What were you doing down here in the first place?

112
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,300
I just wanted to pay my respects.

113
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,730
It was Herodotus who first wrote of these waters.

115
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,400
And Ponce de Leon traveled the earth in search of them.

117
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,710
And their discovery by Al-khidr

118
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,530
is chronicled in the Qu'ran.

119
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,880
And they have permitted me

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,010
to live way beyond my time.

121
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,150
You don't seem to faith about what I told you.

122
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,610
I've seen things that have helped me to believe

123
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,210
that this world is a much bigger place than people realize.

124
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,380
As I told you on the mountain, boy,

125
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,970
man can only evade death for so long.

126
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,750
The waters' powers

127
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,210
are losing their effect on me.

128
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,980
My time is almost over,

129
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,890
but my legacy won't be just ash and bone,

130
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,410
it will be history.

131
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,130
And you think that I'll help you secure that legacy?

132
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,000
You survived my sword.

133
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,840
Your resurrection wasn't a gift from these waters,

134
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,940
rather by force of your own will.

135
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,720
And what better heir to immortality

136
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,870
than someone who has already claimed victory over death?

137
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,350
I didn't defy death just to become an instrument of it.

138
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,810
We are justice.

139
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,940
Isn't that what you've dedicated your life to?

140
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,430
Then why confine your crusade to a single city...

141
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,970
when I can give you a whole world to save.

142
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,990
By executing anyone who stands in my way?

143
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,700
You would command resources that you cannot even fathom.

144
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,040
Numbers greater than any army.

145
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,540
And more loyal.

146
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,940
Now, if you wish for them to renounce killing as you did,

147
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,520
that will be done.

148
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,040
I doubt that. It's called

149
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,880
the League of assassins for a reason.

150
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,770
The League's reason would be your own.

151
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,240
You would be Ra's Al Ghul.

152
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,820
And what if I say no?

153
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,880
Then you are free to leave.

154
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,610
With your compatriots,

155
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,460
as a gesture of good will.

156
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,630
All debts forgiven,

157
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,860
and all blood oaths waived.

158
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,750
Let's go home.

159
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,720
Really need to stop having

160
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,940
these "Thank god you're not dead" reunions.

161
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,750
I agree.

162
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,790
- I'm working on it. - You look ok.

163
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,740
Are you ok?

164
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,610
I'm fine. Not even a scratch.

165
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,020
How is that possible?

166
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,320
How did you get him back?

167
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,500
Doesn't matter. What matters is,

168
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,720
you didn't kill him.

169
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,270
No, I wanted Ra's to kill him.

170
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,330
And I still do.

171
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,610
- Thea... - He's not staying here.

172
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,880
You and I both know there's nowhere else I can take him.

173
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,290
If you think I feel bad for him, you're wrong.

174
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,850
I'm not asking you to feel bad for him;

175
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,260
I'm not asking you to forgive him.

176
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,270
Just let him heal.

177
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,600
I have to go.

178
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,100
How did Thea react to her new house guest?

179
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,560
- Fine. - That bad, huh?

180
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,440
Did she ask how we made it back from Nanda Parbat alive?

181
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,750
Well, I didn't get into it with her.

182
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,650
Well, how about me, Oliver?

183
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,550
Like I said,

184
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,820
Ra's had a change of heart.

185
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,620
Ra's Al Ghul doesn't have a heart.

186
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,260
Two months ago, he kicked you off the side of a mountain

187
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,570
and put a sword through you.

188
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,980
Now he's giving you Malcolm Merlyn back all gift wrapped?

189
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,060
Diggle, we're back. We're alive.

190
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,170
Let's just be grateful for that.

191
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,650
What's the Chinese word for OK?

192
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,660
Or, how do you say OK in mandarin?

193
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,470
"Hao ba."

194
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,360
Ok, everything is going to be "Hao ba."

195
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,630
I want to go home!

196
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,750
Yeah, I--I know, buddy,

197
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,790
but home's not really safe right now.

198
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,990
Because those men tried to hurt us?

199
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,470
Yeah. Because of those men.

200
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,560
In fact, Akio, we shouldn't even really be out in open.

201
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,470
Akio!

202
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,880
Oliver?

203
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,990
Hey, look, you cannot disappear like that!

204
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,570
I thought I saw my father,

205
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,020
but it wasn't him.

206
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,500
Look, I--I--I get it, I get it, and I'm sorry.

207
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,130
We-we can't get separated.

208
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,540
- The botanical gardens! - The what?

209
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,830
Mother and father always told me to go there.

210
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,470
If we ever got separated.

211
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,490
Ok...

212
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,580
Come on!

213
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,290
Well, thank god.

214
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,230
You know, just because I'm furious with you,

215
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,870
that doesn't mean I want you dead.

216
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,130
What about Malcolm?

217
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,470
I mean, I know Laurel wants him dead, I mean, is he?

218
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,910
Nope.

219
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,390
We got him back.

220
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,470
Well, I suppose congrats,

221
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,380
and why, oh, why, did you do that, are in order.

222
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,100
Oliver.

223
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,500
Oliver, what are you doing?!

224
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,570
You're free to go.

225
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,520
My father would never trade my life for yours.

226
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,150
And he certainly wouldn't do it for Malcolm Merlyn's.

227
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,040
He didn't.

228
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,870
If no bargain was struck,

229
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,630
then how are you still alive?

230
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,680
Go home, Nyssa.

231
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,010
Ok. Well,

232
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,860
I don't understand anything anymore.

233
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,860
- Why did Ra's Al Ghul - It doesn't matter.

234
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,550
Let's focus on what does.

235
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,400
Somewhere, this is someone that needs a reminder

236
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,830
that we are still watching over this city.

237
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,690
Well, there is a robbery in progress

238
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,760
at the Kingston Property Depot on third.

239
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,480
New shipment just arrived.

240
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,560
I'm assuming whatever it is, it's worth a lot of money.

241
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,620
Ok. Suit up.

242
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,520
Oliver...

243
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,860
Suit up.

244
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,500
I just want to get this shipment done.

245
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,670
Excuse me. We're looking

246
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,280
for the Catoca shipment. Maybe you could help?

247
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,940
The Catoca shipment. Where is it?

248
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,510
I don't know!

249
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,940
Sorry.

250
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,620
Boss says check the crates

251
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,390
for a Catoca manifest.

252
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,750
Drop it!

253
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,570
Look out!

254
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,350
You still need training.

255
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,850
When are you going to stop telling me that?

256
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,700
When you no longer need training.

257
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,750
Arsenal.

258
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,200
The head guy got away... with these.

260
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,780
Ran into a new player tonight who dropped some bodies.

261
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,860
I need a name.

262
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,790
One of these four will give him up.

263
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,270
Well, when he does, you can read about it in the papers.

264
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,420
Detective?

265
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,750
It's captain now!

266
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,700
When were you going to tell me?

267
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,010
Or were you going to tell me?

268
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,350
You're really going to stand there

269
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,150
still pretending like you didn't know my daughter was dead?

270
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,430
Captain Lance...

271
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,900
My whole career,

272
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,200
my whole life, even when I knew nothing,

273
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,490
I at least knew right from wrong.

274
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,550
And I knew vigilantism was wrong.

275
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,790
The day we take the law into our own hands is a day that we--

276
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,880
we become outlaws.

277
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,300
And that idea, that idea was precious to me.

278
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,830
Almost as precious as my own daughters.

279
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,910
I threw that all away the day I threw in with you.

280
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
You know why?

281
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,090
Cause I trusted you.

282
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,640
But I see the man under the hood now.

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,520
He lies, and he keeps secrets.

284
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,000
Also he doesn't have to carry around

285
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,570
the weight of his decisions.

286
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,300
And I'm done with him.

287
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,550
What would you say if I told you

288
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,350
I just connected the virtual TCP to the open source sensor?

289
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,340
I would say you only think you did,

290
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,890
because I've been trying to figure that out for over two weeks.

291
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,270
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

292
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,640
I have been trying for at least two full minutes.

293
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,330
Ah! Let me see.

294
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,510
Oh, you don't believe me.

295
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,960
Well, no, I'll just, uh, make sure you did it right.

296
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,830
Oh, and if I'm right?

297
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,730
Then I will take you

298
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,400
to the best steak dinner you've ever had.

299
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,700
Which, I'd probably do anyway.

300
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,440
Well, I hope it's better than that fusion place you took me to,

301
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,470
where I needed this microscope to find the food.

302
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,660
Oliver, hey. What are you doing here?

303
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:05,210
I mean, it's nice to see you here.

304
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,300
Nice to see you again, Mr. Palmer.

305
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,290
Likewise.

306
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,990
And please, call me Ray.

307
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,860
Ok. Ray.

308
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,420
May I speak with Felicity for a few minutes, please?

309
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,580
- Absolutely. - Thank you.

310
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,250
Should have called.

311
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,120
No. I'm sorry, I should have told you earlier

312
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,960
when you got back.

313
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,920
- You don't owe me anything. - That's not true.

314
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,590
You're one of my closest friends.

315
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,910
We went up against a new crew last night.

316
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,780
One of them had his lips sewn shut.

317
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,020
Is that a real thing?

318
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,900
Apparently.

319
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,380
If only I had known I have that option.

320
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,060
Ok.

322
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,620
Michael Amar?

323
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,470
Yeah.

324
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,750
Street name's "Murmur"

325
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,360
because of the whole lip stitch thing.

326
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,920
Practitioners say it focuses the mind like meditation.

327
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,070
You ok?

328
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,100
I handed some of Amar's men over to Lance.

329
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,490
He knows the Arrow knew about Sara,

330
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,560
didn't tell him.

331
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,950
What did Lance say?

332
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,540
Some variation on "Go to hell."

333
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,790
Oliver, he just needs time.

334
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,740
No, he's right.

335
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,340
I lied to him. For months.

336
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,720
Kept something from him,

337
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,850
and he had every right to know.

338
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,040
Are you ok?

339
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,640
I mean, besides Lance

340
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,310
and the whole me and Ray thing?

341
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,600
I mean, it just seems like there's something else going on

342
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,650
underneath all that.

343
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,040
I'm fine.

344
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,130
Thanks for help with Amar's name.

345
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,060
Oliver's not here.

346
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,490
Actually, I came by to see how you were doing.

347
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,060
He told you that Malcolm was here?

348
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,070
Go ahead.

349
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,570
I'm the last person to stop you from killing him.

350
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,230
My last attempt to do so didn't exactly work out.

351
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,270
That's kind of why I'm here.

352
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,750
I'm worried about you.

353
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,560
Everyone's so interested in saving my soul these days.

354
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,870
Look, no one wants to see Merlyn dead more than me.

355
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,140
But Oliver was right.

356
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,930
You wanted your own father killed.

357
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,070
Yeah, and how messed up is that?

358
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,910
You know, I wish that

359
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,240
I never learned Malcolm was my father.

360
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,200
Everything since then has just...

361
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,690
You know, you're lucky, Laurel.

362
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,370
You have a normal father.

363
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,360
Someone who really loves you.

364
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,950
Yeah, I can't say we're on the best of terms.

365
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,150
You should probably go.

366
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,450
How much of that did you hear?

367
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,380
Enough to know that I am the last person you wish to see alive.

368
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,780
I'm not going to apologize for what I did.

369
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,280
And I'd do it again.

370
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,730
I know.

371
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,450
You asked me to teach you to be strong.

372
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,320
To make sure you can't be hurt again.

373
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,460
You learned your lessons well.

374
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,370
I have learned nothing from you.

375
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,800
Do you realize that I'm so messed up,

376
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,180
I was willing to die last night?

377
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,190
For what you made me do?

378
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,890
You know, I didn't actually think it was possible

379
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,020
for me to hurt any worse than I did when I came to you.

380
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,040
You proved to me I was wrong.

381
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,020
So what was it again that you taught me?

382
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,010
Show me the knife.

383
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,030
How did you know?

384
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,720
You are my daughter.

385
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,240
Do it like I taught you-- one strike to the neck,

386
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,780
it'll be over quickly.

387
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,330
You're sick.

388
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,370
I love you, and I want to do what is best for you.

389
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,350
If that were even close to being true,

390
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,830
you would have stayed out of my life.

391
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,610
Father.

392
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,160
Your safe return pleases me, my child.

393
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,090
Then extend me the courtesy of explaining

394
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,320
why Malcolm Merlyn is still alive.

395
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,700
If you're not going to watch your tongue,

396
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,670
then at least mind your tone.

397
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,910
Why did you release Al Sah-fer's murderer?

398
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,660
As a gift to Oliver Queen.

399
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,360
An advance for him becoming my heir.

400
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,720
You've selected an outsider over your own daughter?

401
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,840
He survived my sword.

402
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,260
Sara...

403
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,760
You're punishing my love for her.

404
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,750
At least do me the courtesy of admitting it.

405
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,620
You never approved.

406
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,160
I never approved of you allowing weakness into your life.

407
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,470
And even in death,

408
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,830
your devotion to her pollutes your judgment.

412
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,550
Target's name is Michael Amar.

413
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,500
Yeah, got him here. Got out of Iron Heights two months ago.

414
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,120
Did he escape?

415
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,250
No, released.

416
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,630
Turns out he was serving a sentence

417
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,130
based on a coerced confession.

418
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,520
Cops beat it out of him.

419
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,480
He confessed to a crime he didn't commit?

420
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,230
I might sew my mouth shut, too.

421
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,810
He's not innocent anymore.

422
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,230
What was he after tonight?

423
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,660
His crew made off with a couple of crates,

424
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,200
all containing these--

425
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,220
industrial grade diamonds.

426
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,250
But word on the street is

427
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,300
this shipment was loaded with high end jewels they didn't take.

428
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,950
Why would he steal worthless diamonds?

429
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,120
That's the million dollar question.

430
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,040
Actually, street value's only worth a couple thousand.

431
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,020
We could use Felicity on this, Oliver.

432
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,640
She's pre-occupied.

433
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,490
I know a couple of fences from my less socially responsible days.

434
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,000
I could talk to them, see if I can find out

435
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,520
where Amar is trying to move these diamonds.

436
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,630
That's a good idea.

437
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,390
You want to tell me what's going on now?

438
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,360
Ra's predicted this.

439
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,870
He said that the city would turn against me

440
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,390
and I would die alone.

441
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,560
And we come back, and the first thing that happens

442
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,200
is Lance is shutting me out, and...

443
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,720
I see Felicity with Palmer.

444
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,070
It's like he looked into my future.

445
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,030
Sounds to me like Ra's is playing with your head.

446
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,700
Question is, why are you letting him?

447
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,980
He wants me to take his place in the League of Assassins.

448
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,110
That's why he let us go.

449
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,850
As a sign of good faith.

450
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:41,950
Is there even a world where he can imagine you saying yes?

451
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,730
He said that I can do more as the new Ra's

452
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:48,700
than I could ever do as Oliver Queen or the Arrow.

453
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,320
That I would have unlimited resources.

454
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,650
That I could make a difference, not just a dent.

455
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,490
You're not really considering this.

456
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,550
Just because Captain Lance is angry

457
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,360
and Felicity is momentarily unavailable.

458
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,670
It's more than that.

459
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,470
I just...

460
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,830
John, tell me honestly...

461
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,320
what have we accomplished?

462
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:16,940
Oliver...

463
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,380
All the people that we put away,

464
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,060
John, they got out.

465
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,380
The city is no better off.

466
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,860
The Arrow is not...

467
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,970
is not making a difference.

468
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,280
And if I just can't be me...

469
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,710
and the Arrow isn't enough...

470
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,910
Oliver...

471
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,300
Then maybe I should be Ra's Al Ghul.

472
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,490
Is Malcolm still alive?

473
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,130
In my head, I've already slit his throat seven times.

474
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,030
Broke his neck twice.

475
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,930
Sorry that I had to bring him here.

476
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,990
Been trying to remember

477
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,130
who I was before mom died.

478
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,240
Before Malcolm...

479
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,430
And I don't recognize her.

480
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,980
I couldn't even fathom

481
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,940
killing someone, and...

482
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,050
in the last month,

483
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,450
I've held a gun to Slade Wilson's head

484
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,720
and nearly took my father's life twice.

485
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,890
But you didn't kill either of them.

486
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,570
You know why I didn't kill Malcolm?

487
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,840
Mom.

488
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,930
I thought what she'd think about

489
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,720
her daughter becoming a murderer just like him.

490
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,840
Thea...

491
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,560
You're nothing like him.

492
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,960
There's something broken inside of me

493
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,860
just like there's something broken inside of him.

494
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,980
Nothing can change that.

495
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,100
Where are you going?

496
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,600
To go buy my evil dad some soup.

497
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,020
One big, happy family.

498
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,410
What did you do to her?!

499
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:30,370
I encouraged her to kill me.

500
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,430
My version of being a supportive father.

501
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,130
Yeah, you really are insane.

502
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,010
Perhaps. But I'm not the only one.

503
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,760
Or do you doubt that Ra's would release us both

504
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,130
without conditions?

505
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,190
No conditions.

506
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,720
An offer.

507
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,380
To take his place.

508
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,070
You don't seem surprised.

509
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,310
I don't put much stock in augury.

510
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,400
But there is a prophecy.

511
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,350
The man that doesn't perish at the blade of Ra's Al Ghul

512
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,280
will become Ra's Al Ghul.

514
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,110
Ra's Al Ghul doesn't offer,

515
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,400
he orders.

516
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,450
Oliver!

517
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,560
Don't delude yourself into thinking you have a choice.

518
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:26,710
Hey, what are those bamboo things called?

519
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,980
Hey, Akio, come on, all right, it's ok.

520
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,160
"Hao ba."

521
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,250
You need to remember that you're strong, right?

522
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,480
Just like my sister.

523
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,150
- You have a sister? - I do!

524
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,140
And I miss her just as much as you miss your parents.

525
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,750
Why aren't you with her?

526
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,140
Well, I told her that I had to hang out

527
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,910
with my good buddy Akio.

528
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,130
Really?

529
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,040
Yeah. We used to go to botanical gardens

530
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,290
just like these in Starling City,

531
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,150
except she didn't know the...

532
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,100
plants as well as you do.

533
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,140
Oliver?

534
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,370
What's wrong?

535
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,460
Run!

536
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,760
Where's Diggle?

537
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,020
He's out with Roy.

538
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,610
They're on their way back.

539
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,690
Thanks for coming.

540
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,570
Where else would I be?

541
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,750
It's not rhetorical. Ray and I may be a something,

542
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,760
but that doesn't change my commitment to what we're doing here.

543
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,730
Good.

544
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,280
What about your commitment?

545
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,720
John might have told me about your employment offer

546
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,280
from evil incorporated.

547
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,820
He also might have told me that you may be considering it,

548
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,660
which is, by the way, insane.

549
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,280
There's a League of Assassins.

550
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,450
That is not the name of a nice group.

551
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,220
I've been an assassin.

552
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,350
There is more than one path to justice.

553
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,570
There are a lot of different ways I can answer that.

554
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,260
All varying on the theme of you're crazy,

555
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,040
but I'm going to go with,

556
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,220
what makes you think that you're not already on the right path?

557
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,210
Ok. Ok.

558
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,110
'Cause it's been over two years.

559
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,990
You tell me.

560
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,530
What have I really accomplished?

561
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,580
My mother's dead.

562
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,370
Tommy, Sara.

563
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,860
Crime's not down, and my sister

564
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,360
is in ten different kinds of pain right now.

565
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,910
So you leave.

566
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,860
Then what?

567
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,660
All the people you've lost,

568
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,540
all the sacrifices you've made,

569
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,920
it would have been for nothing.

570
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,180
I don't know why I'm doing this anymore.

571
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,710
I can't answer that for you.

572
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,400
Yes, Captain Lance is shutting you out,

573
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,090
but I don't believe you're the Arrow

574
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,150
so that people can say "Thank you."

575
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,210
And, yes, you and I are not together, but that was your choice.

576
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,070
When we thought you were dead,

577
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,370
each one of us had to figure out why we were doing all this.

578
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,060
Seems like it's your turn.

579
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,460
Are we interrupting something?

580
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,620
What do you have?

581
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,350
Just talked to a friend of mine who used to run

582
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,720
a munitions depot back when I was in Afghanistan.

583
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,750
I think I know why our guy is so interested in low grade diamonds.

584
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,960
The type of diamonds Amar and his crew

585
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,330
are interested in is used to make diamond-tipped bullets.

586
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,210
They can go through body armor like tissue paper.

587
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,040
Ok. So who wears body armor?

588
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,190
The police.

589
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:27,420
The guys who beat that false confession out of him,

590
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,730
who put him in prison.

591
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,620
He's going to get payback.

592
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,510
Ok. Roy, suit up.

593
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,640
Dig, I need you to secure the perimeter of the Station.

594
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,170
Felicity--

595
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,620
Call Captain Lance, I'm already on it.

597
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,780
Peace offering.

598
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,400
I already ate.

599
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,910
Right.

600
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,620
You know, it's funny...

601
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,510
a friend of mine is having trouble with her father.

602
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,610
The son of a bitch is barely human, but you...

603
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,050
You know, history has taught me

604
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,350
that you'll give me the cold shoulder for a while,

605
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,130
and then you'll move on to blowing up at me,

606
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,560
and then finally, you'll let it all out

607
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,110
at a dinner that I've dragged you to after days of pleading,

608
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,620
but my point is, is just let me have it!

609
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,450
I deserve every minute of it.

610
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:39,370
And I am ready to take it, but...

611
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,000
don't you think for one second

612
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
that I am giving up on us.

613
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,350
When you were a little girl,

614
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,320
you used to wait up for me when I was on nights.

615
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,320
You couldn't fall asleep

616
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,150
until I walked through that front door.

617
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,620
I remember.

618
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,410
You were always the protector of this family, of everyone.

619
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:00,880
Laurel Lance...

620
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,130
always trying to save the world.

621
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,290
You can't save this.

622
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,220
- Dad... - You don't know how hard I've tried

623
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,020
to forgive you for lying to me the way you did?

624
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,740
I'm not proud of it.

625
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,710
You're my daughter, I'll always love you,

626
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,020
but I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive you.

627
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,830
Kill them all!

628
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,570
Police band is filled with reports of gunfire at the precinct.

629
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,090
Any luck getting to Lance?

630
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,270
Still trying.

631
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,770
I'll lay down cover fire, you haul ass for the exit.

632
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,750
I'm not leaving you!

633
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,190
Just because you think you're some kind of hero now

634
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,710
doesn't mean I'm not going to protect my daughter.

635
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,560
Now on my move, you run!

636
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,850
Go, go, go!

637
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,500
My father's back there!

638
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,060
Go, go, go!

639
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,840
What, are you waiting around for a thank you?

640
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,690
That's not why I do this.

641
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,270
Nice work.

642
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,520
Not without a few casualties,

643
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,060
but Amar is in custody.

644
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,420
So that's a no on the whole victory dance thing, then?

645
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,200
You know me. I don't dance.

646
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,770
But I do occasionally say... thank you.

647
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,400
You're welcome.

648
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,590
And you were right.

649
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,270
A "Thank you" and a "You were right."

650
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,940
I should really be recording this.

651
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,760
I started all of this because of my father,

652
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,690
to... right his wrongs.

653
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:51,760
It became something more.

654
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:56,060
But I never stopped to think about it

655
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,030
or about why...

656
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,710
Until you asked me to.

657
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,200
And what was the answer?

658
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,310
Tonight at the precinct,

659
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,780
the only thing that I could think about was...

660
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,010
those police officers,

661
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,020
and how their families were counting on me,

662
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,890
and Roy, and Diggle,

663
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,060
to get them home safe.

664
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:27,300
That's why I'm doing this.

665
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,450
So...

666
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,360
That means a pass

667
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,620
on becoming the most handsome demon's head ever?

668
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,530
It means I'm not ready to give up on what we're doing here.

669
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,210
You know, you're always saying how you just want me to be happy...

670
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,020
You know, the thing is,

671
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,230
as long as you're in my life, I am.

673
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,470
I should probably take this.

674
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,510
Who are those men?!

675
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,760
I-I don't know.

676
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,200
Then why are we running away from them?

677
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,540
Shado?

678
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,660
Are you all right?

679
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,840
What are you doing here?

680
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,450
Looking for you, actually.

681
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,080
I missed your sister.

682
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,860
I suppose I wanted something to remind me of her.

683
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,610
Now's really not the best time.

684
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,900
Are you... having problems with your father?

685
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,560
I have some experience in that area.

686
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,580
Do you want to talk about it?

687
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
With you?

688
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,480
You know what?

689
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,790
I could use a reminder of Sara, too.

690
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,860
Dinner's on me.

691
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,010
During the fighting,

692
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,560
your technique was competent.

693
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,080
Why do I feel like that's your idea of a compliment?

694
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,970
Could certainly be improved.

695
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,550
Is that an offer to teach me?

696
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
I have nowhere else to go.

697
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,820
It is not customary for one to wait so long

698
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,710
before accepting a great honor.

699
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,160
I'm not accepting it.

700
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,810
Wing ta lao wo chey.

701
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,870
"The tale to be told begins thus."

702
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:49,260
Maseo, this story, it's over before it begins.

703
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,840
You misunderstand.

704
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,190
It does not mean the tale is yet to unfold.

705
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,780
It means Ra's has already written it.

706
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,710
- The choice has been made. - No.

707
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,400
I will always be grateful for what you've done for my family.

708
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,080
For what you meant to Akio.

709
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,760
But if you insist on pursuing this path of resistance...

710
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,530
there will be consequences.

711
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,910
Is that a threat?

712
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,980
It is the will of Ra's Al Ghul.

713
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,850
Yeah, who is it?

714
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,120
Hello?

715
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,980
Thea. Are you ok? What's going on?

716
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,840
I-I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

717
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,430
I don't know who I am.

718
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,220
Can I just stay here with you?

719
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,730
Yeah.

720
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:27,440
Cops believe they've won.

721
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,100
But still got what,

722
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,430
how many rounds of those armor-piercing diamond bullets?

723
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,730
You tell everyone who listen what you've seen.

724
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,150
Go.
