1
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:05,804
- My name is barry allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,473
When I was a child,
I saw my mother

3
00:00:07,475 --> 00:00:09,174
Killed by something impossible.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,943
- Run, barry, run!

5
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,945
- My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:16,849
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:19,585
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:21,653
But secretly I use my speed

9
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,189
To fight crime
and find others like me,

10
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,859
And one day I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:29,128
- Mom!
- And get justice for my father.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,130
I am the flash.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,367
- Previously on <i>the flash...</i>

14
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,835
- Iris west.

15
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,637
I hear you've been
writing about me.

16
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,439
- I've been
collecting internet posts

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,641
About the streak sightings.
- Baby, there's no streak.

18
00:00:42,643 --> 00:00:44,643
- I saw him, barry.
He wears a red suit.

19
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,514
- I finally diagnosed why iris
is writing about the streak.

20
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,015
She's doing it for me.

21
00:00:50,017 --> 00:00:52,251
- I'm gonna find out
who really killed laura,

22
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,420
And I'm going
to get you out of here.

23
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,188
- Whoever this streak is,

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,324
I am not stopping until the rest
of the world believes in him.

25
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:02,995
- Maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a while.

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,069
- To understand
what I'm about to tell you,

27
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,071
You need to do something first.

28
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,740
You need to believe
in the impossible.

29
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,008
Can you do that?

30
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,576
Good, because all of us,

31
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,945
We have forgotten
what miracles look like.

32
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,881
Maybe because they haven't made
much of an appearance lately.

33
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,350
Our lives have become ordinary,

34
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:28,754
But there is someone out there
who is truly extraordinary.

35
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,556
I don't know
where you came from.

36
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,857
I don't know your name,

37
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,859
But I have seen
you do the impossible

38
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:35,861
To protect the city I love.

39
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:39,164
So for those of us who believe
in you and what you're doing,

40
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:41,767
I just want to say thank you.

41
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,040
Hmm.

42
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,544
[exhales]

43
00:01:56,249 --> 00:02:00,219
- You're welcome.

44
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,587
- How did you--

45
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:05,124
I literally just hit send.
- Speed reading.

46
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:08,727
- It's crazy
what you can do to your voice.

47
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,829
- You need to stop
writing your blog.

48
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,564
- People need to know
that you exist.

49
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,001
[phone ringing]

50
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,341
What else can you do?

51
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,576
- This is not an interview.
- Come on.

52
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,245
You got to give me something.

53
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,480
Hobbies, pet peeves,
favorite color?

54
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,648
Wait, scratch that last one.

55
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,583
Red, duh, obviously.

56
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:33,552
- You're not hearing me.
- My hearing is fine.

57
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,821
It's just selective.

58
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:39,758
What should I call you?

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,460
- Anything but the streak.

60
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,463
- Fine. Suggestions?

61
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,798
- You said you were writing
about me to bring hope

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,001
To someone you care about.

63
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:53,839
How would he feel if doing
that put you in harm's way?

64
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,742
- He and I aren't exactly
on the same page these days.

65
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,011
Besides, you're giving hope
to a lot of people,

66
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,346
So I'm doing this for them.

67
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,651
[sirens blaring]

68
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:07,352
- To be continued.

69
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,689
Gotta run.
- Hey!

70
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,991
You can't just leave me up...

71
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:14,526
Here.

72
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,130
Whoa.

73
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:21,166
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

74
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,553
- What kind of a tool
steals a yellow humvee?

75
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,488
- What kind of tool
buys a yellow humvee?

76
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,158
Get these people back.
- I need everybody back!

77
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,464
- Son!
Out of the way!

78
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,334
Out of the way!

79
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,042
[gunshots]

80
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,147
[metal impact]

81
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,549
- What the hell?

82
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,750
- [roars]

83
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:15,153
- Eddie!
Eddie!

84
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,423
- Yeah!

85
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:30,035
- Step out of the vehicle!

86
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,603
- If you say so.

87
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,077
- Uh-oh.

88
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,251
[metal impact, bones cracking]

89
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:49,388
[groans]

90
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,127
[metallic impact]

91
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,563
Unh!

92
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,839
- Looks like you were born
to take a beating.

93
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,948
- Check the math.

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,684
Your dispersal models
don't correlate.

95
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,752
- Uh, they do if you factor
in the seasonal fluctuations

96
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,953
In reproduction cycles.

97
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,422
- What exactly are we debating?

98
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,790
- The average number of bugs

99
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,491
Barry swallows
in a day of running.

100
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,661
- I look forward to seeing
you accept your nobel.

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,968
- Barry?

102
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,306
- Barry?
Are you okay?

103
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:43,208
[gasps]

104
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,043
13 fractures.

105
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:47,479
That's a new record,
and that's just in your hand.

106
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:50,048
You also have a concussion,
three cracked ribs,

107
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,150
And a bruised spleen.

108
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:55,854
Even with your powers,
you'll need a few hours to heal.

109
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,123
- What exactly did you hit?

110
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,524
- A man.

111
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,894
A big, bad man.

112
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,530
His skin changed when I hit him.

113
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,733
Like, it turned to metal.

114
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,368
- Interesting.

115
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,703
A man of steel.

116
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,905
- So you went after
a meta-human alone?

117
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,440
Dude, why didn't you call us?

118
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:18,110
- I didn't know what he was.

119
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,179
Besides, I was off-duty.

120
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,615
- Hmm.

121
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,517
- You're lucky
he didn't knock out your teeth.

122
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,519
Those puppies
don't grow back.

123
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:31,056
- The strange thing is
I feel like I knew him.

124
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,657
- What do you mean?

125
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,928
- He said something
that was familiar,

126
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,663
But he's gonna hurt someone
if we don't stop him.

127
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,599
So how do I fight a guy
that's made of steel?

128
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,067
- We will find a way.

129
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,536
Tonight, you heal.

130
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,538
- Yeah.

131
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,347
- There was lightning
in my house.

132
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:57,282
Yellow and red lightning.

133
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:01,219
There was a man in yellow,
then I was on the street.

134
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,221
I don't know how I got there.

135
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,892
Please, you have to
believe me!

136
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,660
- Hey.

137
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,128
What happened to you
last night?

138
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,731
- Got beat up
by a steel-plated sociopath.

139
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:15,967
Good times.

140
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,403
- So he is a meta-human?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:22,073
- That particle accelerator's
the gift that keeps on giving.

142
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,341
You okay?

143
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,076
- Relatively.

144
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:26,678
Any idea who he is?

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,114
- Eddie's taking point
while I run down a lead.

146
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,615
I need you to work with him
until I get back.

147
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,950
- Wait, why me?

148
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,319
- Because he saw something
impossible

149
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:38,089
That he's got questions about,
questions that I can't answer.

150
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:40,425
- In other words,
make up some science-y stuff

151
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,761
To throw him off?

152
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:44,596
- Exactly.

153
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,465
- [scoffs]

154
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,801
- He stole the humvee
and evaded capture.

155
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,637
So pleased you could join us,
mr. Allen.

156
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,772
Rough night?

157
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,274
- Uh, just a little beat, sir.

158
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,009
- As I was saying,

159
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:01,413
Our perp yanked three atms
after he boosted the vehicle.

160
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:03,582
Atm security cameras
caught him on video.

161
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,217
We got a hit in the database.

162
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,118
Tony woodward.

163
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,820
He's got a history
of violence, petty theft,

164
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,189
Assault, going way back
to juvie.

165
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,124
Dropped off the radar
ten months ago.

166
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,861
Looks like he's back.
[school bell ringing]

167
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,296
- Increased pressure
produces increased heat,

168
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,532
And if you don't release it,
you get combustion.

169
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:22,901
- I don't know how you
remember all this stuff, barry.

170
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:25,804
- Because he's a little freak,
just like his old man.

171
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,572
- Don't talk about my dad.

172
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,640
- Or what?

173
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:32,511
Is he gonna murder me, too?

174
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:36,348
Looks like you were born
to take a beating, allen.

175
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,453
- Allen.

176
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,688
Hey, allen.
- Hey.

177
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,856
- You okay?

178
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,491
- Hey, yeah.
Sorry, eddie.

179
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,727
- Listen,
I saw something last night

180
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,229
I just can't get my head around.

181
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,697
- Uh-huh.

182
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,966
- I fired a dozen rounds
at our car thief,

183
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:58,470
And it was
like they sparked off of him.

184
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,472
- Huh, well, I mean,

185
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:04,476
He must have been
wearing some kind of body armor.

186
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,077
- On his face?

187
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:10,315
- Um--
- hey.

188
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:12,050
Barry.

189
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,418
Hi, babe, I saw the news.

190
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,353
Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine,

191
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,255
Which you would know
if you checked your messages.

192
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,290
I tried you three times.

193
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,424
- Sorry.

194
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,794
I had to work late.

195
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,030
Um, so I heard
that the streak saved a kid.

196
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:26,731
Any comment, detective?

197
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,200
- All I know is our perp
got away,

198
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,403
But barry here is gonna
help me find him.

199
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,904
- Yeah.
- Fine.

200
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,639
I have other sources.

201
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,942
I will see you tonight.

202
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,477
Bye.
- Bye.

203
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,048
What is going on with you two?

204
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,749
- What do you mean?

205
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,418
Nothing, it's fine.
It's--sorry, it's fine.

206
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,688
I don't know.

207
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,756
- Okay.

208
00:09:56,195 --> 00:10:00,098
[elevator dings]

209
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,967
- Dr. Wells.

210
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,035
- I guess you heard about
barry's incident last night.

211
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,104
If you're looking for him
I think he's at the station.

212
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,073
- I actually came here
to see you.

213
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:11,476
I need your help
solving an old case of mine.

214
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,944
- What case is that?

215
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,281
- The murder
of barry's mother.

216
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,025
- Your childhood nemesis is now
an unstoppable meta-human.

217
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,094
That is seriously messed up.

218
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:31,062
- I had a childhood nemesis.

219
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,897
Lexi la roche.

220
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,232
She used to put gum
in my hair.

221
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,567
- Jake puckett.

222
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:37,268
If I didn't let him
copy my homework

223
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,237
He'd give me a swirly.

224
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,272
- Now that we've established
that we're all uber-nerds,

225
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,707
What are we gonna do
about tony?

226
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,542
- Glad you asked.

227
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,378
We're gonna train you, man.

228
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,247
<i>Karate kid</i> style.

229
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,983
Behold!

230
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,053
I call him girder.

231
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:57,522
- For the record,
not my idea.

232
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,257
- Fighting is physics.

233
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,092
It's not about strength.
It's not about size.

234
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,294
It's about energy and power.

235
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,929
Channel your speed the right way

236
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,165
And you can totally take
this bad boy down.

237
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,703
Now obviously your girder
is a moving target.

238
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,107
So--

239
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,113
- I have ice
and bandages standing by.

240
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,795
- [groans]

241
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,431
I'm pretty sure
I just dislocated my shoulder.

242
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,132
[groans]

243
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,667
- Okay, not gonna lie.

244
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,969
This is gonna be quick
but extremely painful.

245
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,940
[phone ringing]

246
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,943
- Oh, speaking of pain.
Eddie, hey.

247
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,712
- Allen, we found the stolen
humvee in the alley

248
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,046
At fremont and lawrence.

249
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,147
Need you down here
to do your thing.

250
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,382
- Great.

251
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,452
I'll see you in a sec.
Okay.

252
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:03,922
Okay.
Let's do this.

253
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:08,927
- So barry, when you said
you were off-duty last night,

254
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,362
You weren't
visiting iris again.

255
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,498
You know, in disguise?

256
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,502
'cause that would be reckless
and a little creepy.

257
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:18,737
- No.

258
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,938
- Good.

259
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,173
[joint pops]
- [screams]

260
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,444
- Allen, you really need a car.

261
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,513
- I usually
manage on foot okay.

262
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:29,914
What do we got?

263
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,683
- The rig tony woodward
boosted last night.

264
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,384
No sign of the stolen atms.

265
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,420
Probably got
those where he's holed up,

266
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,523
Though he's gonna have one hell
of a time breaking 'em open.

267
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,926
- I wouldn't be so sure.

268
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,496
- So, about you and iris--

269
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:46,865
- Look, eddie, we had a fight,

270
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,667
And I just don't really
feel comfortable

271
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,269
Talking about it with you.

272
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:55,073
- I get that, and I get that
you two go way back.

273
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:58,109
To be honest, I was a little
threatened by you at first.

274
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,444
- You were threatened by me?

275
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,945
- Sure.

276
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,448
I mean, I've seen
how close you two are,

277
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,016
But you seem like a good guy,

278
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,286
And iris, I just
want her to be happy.

279
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,656
From my experience,
good friends are hard to find.

280
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:13,992
- Detective.
Excuse me.

281
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,128
Sir, we ran the plates
on that humvee--

282
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,398
- Come on, barry!
You can do it!

283
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,933
- Barr, focus!

284
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,735
- I am!

285
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,270
- Son, son, son.

286
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:27,572
You're getting frustrated.

287
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:29,808
You need to learn
how to control your emotions.

288
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,343
Iris, come here, sweetie.

289
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,245
- You want me to hit a girl?

290
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,780
- He wants you to try.

291
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,282
- Relax, barry.

292
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:38,416
I've had her in gloves
since she was six.

293
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,819
She's tougher than she looks.

294
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,298
- Sorry, barry.

295
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,067
- Son...

296
00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:00,338
Sometimes the best way to
win a fight is not to start one,

297
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,874
But if you do
come up against somebody

298
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,676
You know
you can't beat, be smart.

299
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,578
It's okay to run
the other way.

300
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,146
All right?

301
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,481
- So what do you think?

302
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:14,686
- Judging by the mud and kegs
I'd say he got hammered,

303
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,187
Stole a big-ass truck,

304
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,622
And went joyriding.

305
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,357
I bet the kegs are stolen, too.

306
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,626
Rusty iron ale, it's a micro
brewed right over in--

307
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,161
- Keystone, I know the place.

308
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,331
Let's check it out.
- Yeah.

309
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:42,914
- Barry described a tornado
of red and yellow lightning

310
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,550
Inside a man in yellow.

311
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,085
Then, bam.

312
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,653
He's blocks away on the street.

313
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,355
Doesn't know how he got there.

314
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,956
When I arrived,
the place was a wreck.

315
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,224
- Nora allen is dead.

316
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,859
- Single stab wound
to the heart.

317
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,794
Henry allen
covered in her blood.

318
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,963
- And despite all the evidence
that henry allen is guilty,

319
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:03,601
Now you believe this--what,
man in yellow is responsible?

320
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,103
- Last night, I saw barry

321
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,205
Rescue a young boy
from being run over,

322
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:10,541
And it looked exactly like what
barry described happened to him.

323
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:12,277
It got me thinking,

324
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:16,881
What if somebody with barry's
abilities killed nora?

325
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,716
- There's one flaw with
your theory though, detective,

326
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:22,520
And is that all of this
happened 14 years ago,

327
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,922
Which is long before--

328
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,456
- Your machine gave barry
his powers.

329
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,058
- An accident gave barry
his powers.

330
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,727
- Do you think it is possible

331
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,263
That somebody
with barry's super-speed

332
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,299
Could have existed
before the explosion?

333
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:37,435
- Detective, I deal
in probabilities as a scientist,

334
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,871
And in this case...

335
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,873
It's highly unlikely.

336
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,717
- Gentlemen, ccpd.

337
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,118
Any chance
some of your merchandise

338
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,153
Was stolen last night?

339
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,588
- No, I don't think so.

340
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:01,759
- How about this guy?
You seen him?

341
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,197
- You know tony, don't you?

342
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,469
- Hey.

343
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,038
Allen, come on!

344
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,288
Allen, you okay?

345
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,323
- Oh, never better.
- Get up.

346
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,791
- I didn't do nothing, man!

347
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,193
- So why'd you run?

348
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,695
- Look, it was an accident!
- What was?

349
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,031
- Tony falling, okay?

350
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,967
But I swear to god,
we didn't kill him!

351
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,369
- Keep talking.

352
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,205
- About ten months ago,
keystone ironworks.

353
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:49,307
Boss is handing out pink slips.

354
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,143
Tony gets his,
and he just snapped.

355
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,212
He started beating the crap
out of the guy.

356
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,181
We pulled him off,
and then the lights went out.

357
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,784
Some kind of power surge.
And then tony

358
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,321
Went over the railing right
into a vat of molten scrap.

359
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:04,856
Just gone.

360
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,657
- Lucky for you
he's still alive.

361
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,893
- What?

362
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,661
- How'd you get in front of us?

363
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,663
- Shortcut.

364
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,902
- â™ª when I was just a boy,
my mama...â™ª

365
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:21,439
- I've been meaning to ask you,
where's your shadow?

366
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:22,840
- What shadow?

367
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,676
- Barry.
He hasn't been in all week.

368
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,612
- Getting his fix
somewhere else.

369
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,280
- Too bad.

370
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:33,284
He's cute, I kind of miss
having him around.

371
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:37,922
- Iris?
Long time no see.

372
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:49,901
- I got to say,
iris, you look amazing.

373
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,235
- Thanks, tony.

374
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,371
Um, you too.

375
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,772
- Oh, yeah.
I keep in shape.

376
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,674
I got a gym at my place.

377
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,676
Been living out in keystone
on the west side,

378
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:02,246
And you should, uh--
you should stop by sometime.

379
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,182
- So, uh,
can I get you a drink?

380
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,851
- No, I came to see you.

381
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,286
- How did you know I was here?

382
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,088
- I've been reading up
on the streak.

383
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,056
Found your little blog.

384
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,225
Why are you writing
about this guy?

385
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,961
- People say that he's a hero.

386
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:19,230
- I say he's a coward,

387
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,965
And I happen to know that he
took a beating last night

388
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:24,602
And ran off like a little girl.
You should write about that.

389
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,172
Do you have any idea

390
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,641
Who leather boy is?

391
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,943
- No clue.

392
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,945
So, um,
if you don't want a drink

393
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:35,480
I should probably
get back to work.

394
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:39,083
- Actually I'd prefer to buy you
a drink.

395
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,619
What time you off?
- Thanks, tony,

396
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,754
But I don't think
my boyfriend would approve.

397
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,057
He's a cop, like my dad.

398
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,593
- I never really did like cops
too much.

399
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,795
- Iris!

400
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:57,268
- Well he's picking me up
for the policeman's ball.

401
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,903
Wall-to-wall cops.
Can't swing a cat.

402
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,072
I should probably call
him to see where he is--

403
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:04,509
- Give me the phone, iris.
Now!

404
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,888
I'm sorry.
Uh, for the damage.

405
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,958
We'll pick this up
some other time.

406
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,061
- [breathes heavily]

407
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,003
- Barry!
Check it out!

408
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,372
The gravel
you pulled from tony's ride?

409
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,407
It contains 76.8% hematite.

410
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,677
Consistent with the mines
at keystone ironworks.

411
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,013
- Which closed
down ten months ago.

412
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:43,514
It's the perfect hideout.

413
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,717
- Barry, do you mind telling me
about this?

414
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,153
"I have info about someone
you're looking for.

415
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,388
"he was here.

416
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,392
You know where to find me."

417
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,795
Now who could she be
talking to?

418
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,176
- I guess you got my message.

419
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,312
- Are you okay?

420
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,981
- Cop's daughter.
I can handle myself.

421
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,749
- Not with this guy.

422
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,219
- I knew him when we were kids.
He didn't want to hurt me.

423
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,820
He wanted to impress me,

424
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:25,489
But he is fixated on you,
and not in a good way.

425
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,225
- Do you know where he went?

426
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,560
- He said he had a place
out in west keystone.

427
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,897
Bragged about how big it was,
but I have no idea where.

428
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,967
- I do.
- Wait, there's something else.

429
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:37,235
His hand.

430
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:41,472
It transformed
like an iron fist.

431
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,708
He's like you, isn't he?

432
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,712
- Yes, and writing about me
is what brought him to you.

433
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:49,080
- I know,
but maybe I could talk--

434
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:52,383
- No!
He's too dangerous.

435
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,685
[knocking on glass]

436
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,654
- Damn, that's my ride.

437
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,689
Eddie insisted on a detail.
[whoosh]

438
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:01,859
I have to...Go.

439
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:07,265
- Barry, talk to us.
What are you doing?

440
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,470
- Dude, don't run angry.

441
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:15,606
We don't know
how to defeat him yet.

442
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,478
- This is definitely
the place.

443
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,686
- You're trespassing, freak!

444
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,856
There's nowhere left to run.

445
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,932
- Barry?
- Barry, where are you?

446
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:16,600
Caitlin, over here!

447
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,770
- Barry?
Please, say something!

448
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:23,874
Say something
so we know you're okay.

449
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:27,978
- Ow.
- Get him out of there!

450
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,180
- What were you thinking?

451
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,815
What were you thinking?

452
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:33,050
I told you
that we would figure out a way

453
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,452
To deal with him.
- I'll heal.

454
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,020
- You can't heal
when you're dead.

455
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,288
He could have killed you.

456
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,824
- I know, all right?
I know!

457
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,326
In the past 36 hours
I've had my ass

458
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:45,129
Handed to me twice by the guy
that tortured me as a kid.

459
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,099
I couldn't stop him then,
and I can't stop him now!

460
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:50,668
Even with my powers
I'm still powerless against him.

461
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,870
- Not necessarily.

462
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,205
Cisco?

463
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,940
Any material,

464
00:22:55,942 --> 00:23:00,177
If struck at a high enough
velocity can be compromised.

465
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,280
- We ran an analysis on
the metal in tony's footprint.

466
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,616
Based on its density
and atomic structure,

467
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,586
If you impact it
at just the right angle,

468
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:13,190
At just the right speed, you
could do some serious damage.

469
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,892
- How fast would I have to go?

470
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,660
- Factoring in the metal's
tensile strength,

471
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:20,498
Estimated dermal thickness,
atmospheric pressure, air temp,

472
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,368
You'd have to hit him
at approximately...

473
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,704
Mach 1.1.

474
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:29,774
- You want barry to hit
something at 800 miles an hour?

475
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,610
- 837, actually.

476
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:33,844
- That's faster than the speed
of sound.

477
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,212
- I know.

478
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,047
He would create a sonic boom,

479
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,950
Which, as I've said before,
would be awesome.

480
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,519
- I've never gone that fast.

481
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,287
- Yet.

482
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,257
- I can't believe we're actually
entertaining this idea.

483
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,226
I mean, he'd need
a straight shot from miles away

484
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,896
- Yeah, 5.3 miles,
theoretically.

485
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:56,600
- Do it right,
you'll take him down.

486
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,502
- Do it wrong,

487
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:02,740
You'll shatter every bone
in your body.

488
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,779
- Barry.

489
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,980
- Joe, I've been
beaten up enough for one day.

490
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,116
I gotta--
- hey, wait.

491
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:15,019
An anonymous tip led us
to tony woodward's hideout.

492
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,787
The place was trashed.
What happened?

493
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,789
- He shows up at jitters
to see iris.

494
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,558
I had to go after him.
- Iris, where is she?

495
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,892
- She's fine, she's fine.

496
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,161
Eddie put a detail
on her to be safe.

497
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:26,263
I thought I could
handle him this time.

498
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,731
I tried.

499
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:30,301
- Look, I know what this punk
put you through,

500
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:34,271
But you can't let emotion
cloud your judgment.

501
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,407
- The tollbooth camera
got a shot of woodward.

502
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:38,075
Stolen car headed out of town.

503
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,578
State police are taking over.

504
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,580
We lost him.
- Don't worry, eddie.

505
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:43,848
They'll get him.

506
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,115
- I wanted
to take this guy down.

507
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,451
- Not half as much as I did.

508
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,086
- Let's go, allen.

509
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:50,154
- Go where?

510
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,222
- Blow off some steam.

511
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,624
I need to hit something.
- What?

512
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:55,092
- I don't think he meant
hit you.

513
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,428
Go.

514
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,306
- So I heard you and this
woodward guy have a history.

515
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,808
Hey, allen.

516
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,543
It's okay.
Trust me.

517
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,745
I had my fair share of bullies
at school.

518
00:25:14,747 --> 00:25:17,081
- Yeah, somehow I find
that hard to believe.

519
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:21,485
- I was short, fat,
and the son of a politician

520
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,420
Who closed the factory
in my school district,

521
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,991
So not so popular.

522
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,662
- So what'd you do about it?

523
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,731
- I got my ass kicked.

524
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:39,003
A lot, until my gym coach
took pity on me.

525
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:41,672
She said the key
to fighting is patience.

526
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,674
Here.

527
00:25:43,676 --> 00:25:47,211
A lot of guys waste energy
trying to land the most punches.

528
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:51,382
All it takes is one,
but you got to make it count.

529
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,585
Choose your spot
and drive through it,

530
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:58,055
Like it's six inches
behind the target.

531
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:07,264
Harder.

532
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:14,138
Harder!

533
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,944
[coughs]

534
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:24,381
- The seam
was starting to split.

535
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:25,716
[chuckles]

536
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:30,721
- Appreciate you coming down.

537
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:33,357
- Hmm, well these days
it's rare to find someone

538
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,594
Happy to have a drink with me.

539
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:41,131
- Well, our conversation
yesterday got me thinking.

540
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,867
You said, as a scientist,
you look for the probable?

541
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,235
- That's right.

542
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:47,538
- And we both recently
have seen things

543
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,741
That have redefined
what is possible.

544
00:26:50,743 --> 00:26:52,943
- Yes, we have,
and we both know

545
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,111
The direct cause
of those things.

546
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,913
- Your accelerator explosion.

547
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:58,882
- Evolutionary leaps follow the
creation of new technologies.

548
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,117
It's that simple.

549
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,520
- Like the roomba.
[laughs]

550
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:08,158
- Yes, like the roomba.

551
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,362
- So humor me here.

552
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,997
- Hmm?

553
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:17,668
- If we know that meta-humans
were created

554
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,537
By the particle accelerator
and testimony shows

555
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,173
That a meta-human may have been
involved in the murder

556
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:27,978
Of barry allen's mother 14 years
ago, it seems to me that...

557
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,181
Way back then
there must have been

558
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:36,186
Another
particle accelerator.

559
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,657
- Another particle accelerator?
- Hmm.

560
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,292
- I can assure you that's
extremely unlikely, detective,

561
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:45,763
And if they were I don't recall
any dark matter lightning storms

562
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,431
Before I moved to town.

563
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,467
Do you?

564
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:55,839
- No, no, I don't.

565
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,543
When did you move to town,
dr. Wells?

566
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,888
- Something tells me
that you already know the answer

567
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,523
To that question, detective.

568
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:17,861
This whole "help me solve
the murder of nora allen,"

569
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,531
You were never
looking for my help, were you?

570
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:25,002
- You opened your lab a month
after nora allen's murder.

571
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:26,737
Would you mind telling me
what you were doing

572
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,441
In central city before that?

573
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,345
- I was starting over.

574
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:39,583
- Starting what over?

575
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:43,053
- Here I thought
we were just two guys

576
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,222
Having a friendly drink.

577
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,657
You want answers, detective?

578
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:48,692
Tess morgan, look her up.

579
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:55,933
- [exhales]

580
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,606
- Unit 52, this is dispatch.

581
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,942
Requesting status update
on the west house.

582
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:06,777
- Unh!

583
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:19,757
- Hey, iris.

584
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,601
- Nice, allen.
- Yeah.

585
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,136
- All right.
- Okay.

586
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:33,670
- Hey, next time
work on your speed.

587
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:36,907
- Yeah, I'll do my best.

588
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,243
- Thawne, allen.

589
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,345
The unit watching joe's
daughter, they've been attacked.

590
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,014
Iris is missing.

591
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:48,752
- Go, all right?
I'll call joe.

592
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:51,922
- Let's adjust the impact angle
by .2 degrees,

593
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,324
Up the speed to 838.

594
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:58,395
Bam.

595
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,064
Ouch.
- Ouch?

596
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,132
- Guys, you there?

597
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,634
- Yeah, man, what's up?

598
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,269
- Tony took iris.

599
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,670
I need you to do whatever you
can to help me find her.

600
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,305
All right?
Satellites, security cameras.

601
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:10,274
Hack 'em all.
- We're on it.

602
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,413
- What's wrong?

603
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:25,189
- Remember this place, iris?

604
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,591
- So what's the plan here,
tony?

605
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,626
You finally gonna
go for that g.E.D?

606
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,261
- You want a plan?
How's this?

607
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,596
You used to write
about the streak, right?

608
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,464
Now you're gonna write
about me.

609
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,466
- You just abducted me, tony.
Why would I do that?

610
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:39,736
- Because the streak is dead.

611
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,271
- No.

612
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,007
- Squashed like a little bug
by me.

613
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,609
So if you don't want
the same thing to happen to you,

614
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,077
You're gonna
tell the whole world

615
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,980
That there's a new big man
on campus!

616
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:52,583
And I'm just getting started.

617
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:53,984
- You could have
anybody write about you, tony.

618
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,853
Why me?

619
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:59,289
- 'cause I like you, iris.
Always have.

620
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:07,030
- You should have said
something.

[fire alarm blaring]

like that again

And I'm gonna leave
more than a bruise!

- Eddie, anything yet?

625
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,675
- We have roadblocks
on every major artery.

626
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,244
Units are searching.

627
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,813
- We will find iris, joe.

628
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,720
- You don't think
he'll hurt her, do you?

629
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:33,223
- Sir, sir, we got a fire alarm
call at carmichael elementary.

630
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,525
- Dispatch the fire department.
We'll send backup when we can.

631
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,960
- That's the school
you and iris went to.

632
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:40,564
- And tony.
- Go.

633
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,205
- Tony, turn yourself
in before things get worse.

634
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,673
It's not too late.

635
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,375
- Yeah, it is.

636

Cops are already looking for me,

00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,146
So get ready to cover
the showdown of a lifetime

without a fight.

'cause you just found one.

Come to save
your little fan girl?

- This is between us.

643
00:32:10,129 --> 00:32:13,797
Let her go.

644
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,633
- Oh, I could,
but I'd rather make her watch

645

While I break every bone
in your body.

646
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,416

- Okay.

do you think you are?

give us abilities.

705
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,056
- Detective.

706
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:36,059
Are you here to make
more accusations?

707
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:39,629
- I'm here to make amends.

708
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,666
I looked up tess morgan.

709
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:46,670
I'm sorry for your loss.

710
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,378
You two were research partners
in maryland?

711
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,748
- Yes, we were.
We were...

712
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,884
Married to the work
as much as to each other.

713
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:04,221
After the car accident...

714
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,990
I could not go back to the work.

715
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,858
Could not go back to our lab.

716
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,395
- So you moved here.

717
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,198
- Where no one knew me.

718
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,602
Where no one could remind me
of what I had lost,

719
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,040
And, um...

720
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,409
I--

721
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,379
I found it difficult,

722
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,982
Starting over,

723
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:35,785
Rebuilding,

724
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:39,789
And what took me 14 years
tess could have done in 4,

725
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:43,927
Believe me,
she--she--

726
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,134
At the time
of nora allen's murder,

727
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,637
The particle accelerator that I
would eventually create

728
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,405
Was--[snaps fingers]--
but a notion,

729
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,207
Much less a reality,

730
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:01,578
And so whomever or whatever is
responsible for her death,

731
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,883
It did not originate
from me or from my work.

732
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,219
- I'm sorry I doubted you,

733
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:13,123
But I hope I can still
count on your help.

734
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,763
- [chuckles]

735
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,298
You don't give up, do you?

736
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,467
- Nope.
Not till I get my man.

737
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:28,338
I owe that to barry
and to henry.

738
00:38:30,107 --> 00:38:34,210
- Barry is lucky
to have you on his side, joe.

739
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:40,784
[pop music playing]

740
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:43,887
â™ª

741
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:47,057
- Hi.

742
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:50,293
Oh, I thought
that you were someone else.

743
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,866
- So joe told me
what happened.

744
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,269
How's the hand?

745
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:03,340
- Not broken,
so that's something.

746
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:12,882
- I should have believed--
- I'm sorry I said--

747
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:14,784
I've missed you.

748
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:18,388
- Yeah, I've missed you too.

749
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:23,760
When I heard
tony took you, I--

750
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,261
I just--
I don't know what I would do

751
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,430
If anything happened to you.

752
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:32,702
- Well, my guardian angel's
looking out for me.

753
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,872
Do you want to hang out
and catch up?

754
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,040
- Yeah.

755
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,575
I would like that, yeah.

756
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,710
- I promise not to talk
about the streak tonight.

757
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,078
- No, I want you to.

758
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,246
No, I mean, I want--you can--

759
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,748
I want you to talk

760
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,015
About whatever you'd want
to talk about.

761
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,350
I know it's important to you.

762
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:49,886
- Good because it's not
just the streak.

763
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,689
There are others out there
that are like him.

764
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:55,525
I've gotten scattered posts
about this guy that's on fire,

765
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:57,260
Except that he doesn't burn up.

766
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:58,828
- Okay, so wait.
Wait.

767
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,332
You're trying to find
the burning man now too?

768
00:40:02,334 --> 00:40:04,100
- Yeah, why not?
I mean, a lot can happen

769
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,502
In a week,
especially with the streak.

770
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,404
- Heh.

771
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,205
- I've been trying to
get answers from him.

772
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,840
Where does he come from?
How does he do what he does?

773
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,342
But he dodges everything.

774
00:40:12,344 --> 00:40:16,679
Literally,
with this super-speed power.

775
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,350
When he moves, barry,
you don't even see him.

776
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:22,352
He comes and goes
in the blink of an eye,

777
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:25,889
In a--
- flash?

778
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,662
- In a flash.

779
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,103
Yeah.

780
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,608
Today, I was saved by
the impossible.

781
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,045
A mystery man.
The fastest man alive.

782
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:53,349
Then a friend gave me an idea
for a new name,

783
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:58,354
And something tells me
it's gonna catch on.

784
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:27,650
[power shutting off]

785
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,125
[glass shatters]

786
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,143
- Greg, move your head.
