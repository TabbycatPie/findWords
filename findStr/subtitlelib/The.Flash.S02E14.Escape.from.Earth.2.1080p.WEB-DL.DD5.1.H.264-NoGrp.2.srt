1
00:00:01,653 --> 00:00:02,919
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,921 --> 00:00:05,689
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:08,725
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:11,761
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:15,365
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,267
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:20,637
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:24,007
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:27,778
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,813 --> 00:00:28,980
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,459
His name is Geomancer.

12
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:33,294
I'm waiting on the man in red.

13
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:35,096
The Velocity-7's wearing off.

14
00:00:36,266 --> 00:00:37,665
- You hurt?
- Only my pride.

15
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,634
Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her.

16
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:40,969
Daddy, please help me.

17
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,270
Don't let him take me, Daddy.

18
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:43,538
I told you we're a team.

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,839
Now you're a part of it.

20
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:46,307
We're gonna help you save Jesse.

21
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:47,408
We're not sending you through alone.

22
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,710
We're going to Earth-2.

23
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:50,178
Just remember what Jay said, okay?

24
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,312
Things here are all sorts of trippy.

25
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:52,347
Caitlin...

26
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:53,781
If you knew me at all,

27
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,416
you would know that I hate the name Caitlin.

28
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:57,785
I'm Killer Frost.

29
00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:58,987
Look out!

30
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:01,522
Dad!

31
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:03,324
You killed my father, you evil bitch.

32
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:05,126
You shouldn't have
palled around with a breacher.

33
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:07,061
- Flash, save us!
- No!

34
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:08,696
Zoom wanted him alive.

35
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:12,634
You know what Zoom will do
if you don't obey him.

36
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:14,602
No!

37
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:16,537
Argh!

38
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,706
Look around, Flash.

39
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:23,478
This is the last place you'll ever see.

40
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:29,484
I know you're here, Harrison Wells,

41
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:33,154
and you did not come alone.

42
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,725
You can try to hide...

43
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:45,199
But I'm the fastest man alive.

44
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:50,705
I will scour this city

45
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:53,875
until I hunt you down.

46
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:55,843
And when I do,

47
00:01:55,845 --> 00:02:00,315
all of you will feel my wrath.

48
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:07,288
CCPN is reporting that Dr. Harrison Wells,

49
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,956
the infamous founder of S.T.A.R. Labs

50
00:02:08,958 --> 00:02:10,658
who uncharacteristically has gone unseen

51
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,394
for nearly four months is now a wanted man.

52
00:02:13,396 --> 00:02:15,229
These images and messages
went up moments ago

53
00:02:15,231 --> 00:02:18,466
throughout Central City by Zoom.

54
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:20,201
Have you seen channel 52?

55
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:22,203
You're not safe here, Dr. Wells.
Zoom's looking for you.

56
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:23,738
I know what he's doing. Alert security.

57
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,739
Evacuate S.T.A.R. Labs.

58
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:26,341
Lock down the facility.

59
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:28,142
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me, Henry.

60
00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:29,444
Just get everyone out of here now.

61
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:31,713
Now! Go!

62
00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:32,947
Harry!

63
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,382
Don't shoot!

64
00:02:34,384 --> 00:02:36,284
Damn it, Ramon.

65
00:02:37,454 --> 00:02:39,187
Where's Allen?

66
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,555
- Zoom took him.
- What?

67
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:42,256
We tracked down Deathstorm and Killer Frost,

68
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:43,825
met my doppelganger, Reverb...

69
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,893
super evil guy, super evil powers.

70
00:02:45,895 --> 00:02:48,029
The three of them almost
took down Barry until

71
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:50,698
Zoom showed up, killed Cisco-2,

72
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,533
killed Deathstorm for hurting a speedster.

73
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,469
But then he left Killer Frost alive

74
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:55,636
and then took off with Barry.

75
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:57,071
How are you still alive?

76
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:58,339
Looks like he cares even less about me

77
00:02:58,341 --> 00:02:59,307
than you do, Harry.

78
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:00,942
No, no.

79
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:02,543
Zoom doesn't do anything by accident.

80
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:03,745
Did he follow you here?

81
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:04,979
I've seen “Heat” like 50 times, okay?

82
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:05,980
I know how to shake a tail.

83
00:03:05,982 --> 00:03:06,981
He didn't follow me.

84
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,116
But check this out.

85
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:09,283
I jacked these from my dead ringer.

86
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:10,351
I think we can tweak these puppies...

87
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:11,919
use them to find Zoom.

88
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:13,488
Damn it, Ramon, we don't have time for this.

89
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,922
Zoom is hunting us...

90
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:16,357
Zoom is hunting us!

91
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,558
We need to make an alternate plan,

92
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,960
because if we don't, Zoom...

93
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:20,728
Stop thinking like that, okay?

94
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,197
We're gonna find Jesse,
and we're gonna find Barry.

95
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,298
I know we will.

96
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,134
Hello? Is anyone there?

97
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:28,636
Okay, whoever's responsible for this,

98
00:03:28,638 --> 00:03:30,571
oh, ho, ho...

99
00:03:30,573 --> 00:03:32,206
boy, we're gonna have words,

100
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,541
the two of us, okay?

101
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:35,543
This is... this is not okay.

102
00:03:35,545 --> 00:03:36,711
Barry-2.

104
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,482
Dr. Wells,

105
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:43,251
this is very disappointing.

106
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:45,453
I mean, the two of you
should be ashamed of yourselves.

107
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:47,955
You can't just lock someone
in a room like this.

108
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:49,657
How long was I in here for?

109
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:53,461
Barely a day.

110
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:54,796
One day?

111
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:56,230
One day?

112
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:57,932
Oh, jeez, my wife's gonna be worried sick.

113
00:03:57,934 --> 00:03:59,600
- Dr. Wells.
- Yeah?

114
00:03:59,602 --> 00:04:01,335
Doctor, I'm not sure
if you're aware of this,

115
00:04:01,337 --> 00:04:04,539
but my wife is
a very well-respected detective

116
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,973
in the Central City Police Department.

117
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:08,376
She's got to be very upset.

118
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:10,411
Whoa, this is heavy.

119
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:11,412
It certainly is.

120
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:13,147
And I'm sorry, fellas,

121
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:15,650
but I demand to know what the heck

122
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:17,084
is going on here this instant.

123
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:18,719
Barry, this is a very long story.

124
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,154
One that we don't have time
to tell right now.

125
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,622
We're sorry we locked you in that room

126
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,691
for a day, but right now, you need to leave.

127
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:26,727
You need to gather...

128
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:27,795
He's here.

129
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:34,202
Do not move.

130
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:43,778
Ugh!

131
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,482
Where are Wells and his friends?

132
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:53,020
Dr. Wells, hey, what the heck is going on?

133
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:54,455
Oh, Zoom's after us.

134
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:56,457
Zoom? What do...
Why would Zoom be after you?

135
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:57,525
That's part of that long story

136
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:58,593
I was telling you about.

137
00:04:58,595 --> 00:04:59,594
I don't know if I can

138
00:04:59,596 --> 00:05:00,828
deal with something like this.

139
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,463
- You have a time vault?
- Yeah.

140
00:05:02,465 --> 00:05:04,298
I'm an enemy of Zoom,
and I need a place to hide

141
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,399
when something like this happens.

142
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,601
- Get in!
- Yes, sir.

143
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,776
That's Zoom! That's Zoom!

144
00:05:15,778 --> 00:05:17,812
Ramon...

145
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,247
Shut him up.

146
00:05:37,066 --> 00:05:38,332
Okay.

147
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,268
Breathe, breathe, breath, breath...

148
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,602
Fake wall.

149
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:43,237
He's not gonna fall for another fake wall.

150
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,472
We need to move.

151
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:45,773
We need to find a different place to hide

152
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:46,974
and make a plan.

153
00:05:46,976 --> 00:05:48,376
Wait, wait... hey, hey, hey, hey.

154
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:49,477
No.

155
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,878
I think before we do anything,

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,780
you have to explain to me everything

157
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:54,282
that is going on here.

158
00:06:04,794 --> 00:06:06,594
You're wasting your time.

159
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:07,962
I used to think I could escape too

160
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:09,697
when I first got here.

161
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,266
There's no way out.

162
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:18,306
Who is that?

163
00:06:18,308 --> 00:06:20,041
I don't know.

164
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:24,011
He's been here since Zoom
brought me to this place.

165
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:28,683
Stop, okay?

166
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,185
Just... just please stop.

167
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:34,121
Jesse, I think he might
be trying to help us.

168
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:37,158
Nothing is gonna help us.

169
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,794
That's not true.

170
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,128
We're gonna get out of here.

171
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,331
Your dad's gonna find us, I promise.

172
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,632
You sure have a lot of faith

173
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:47,268
in a man who only cares about himself.

174
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:53,774
You know, I actually thought that

175
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:56,310
at first too.

176
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:58,746
It's not true.

177
00:06:58,748 --> 00:07:01,349
Every decision that he's made...

178
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:05,453
every action he's taken since we've met...

179
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:07,321
has been to save you.

180
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,225
Your dad hasn't given up on you, Jesse.

181
00:07:11,227 --> 00:07:14,562
Don't give up on him.

182
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,500
Believe what you want,

183
00:07:19,502 --> 00:07:23,204
but the only reason that you're still alive

184
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,406
is so I can kill you

185
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:27,074
in front of your father.

186
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:30,544
And the only reason
your father's still alive...

187
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,450
Is to get me your speed.

188
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,855
Once he does that,

189
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:43,557
he will die too.

190
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:50,595
Up after the break,

191
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:51,897
earthquake-causing meta-human

192
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,665
leaves citizens shaken and wondering,

193
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,600
where is The Flash?

194
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:56,701
It's finished.

195
00:07:56,703 --> 00:07:58,537
Breach stabilized again.

196
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:01,260
Barry, Cisco, and Wells
have 20 hours to get back.

197
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,289
You're amazing.

198
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:04,321
When it comes to
stabilizing breaches, maybe...

199
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,990
not so much when it comes
to fighting meta-humans.

200
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:08,625
You were a little rusty.

201
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:10,060
I was too slow.

202
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:13,864
Geomancer's still out there, Caitlin.

203
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:15,298
He has to be stopped.

204
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,867
I have to be ready in case he attacks again.

205
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,435
How much longer till the Velocity...

206
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:19,402
8.

207
00:08:19,404 --> 00:08:21,371
Velocity-8 is ready?

208
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:23,039
I need to finalize the compound...

209
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,475
make sure the extracellular
matrix stays intact

210
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:28,211
so you don't lose your speed as fast.

211
00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:31,281
Okay, great.

212
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:34,651
What is it?

213
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:36,786
After your last encounter with Geomancer,

214
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:38,822
I ran some tests.

215
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:41,391
The Velocity-7 is reacting

216
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:43,393
with the damaged cells in your body.

217
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:45,629
It's causing more cellular degeneration.

218
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:47,631
Well, I have faith that the next batch

219
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:48,865
won't do the same thing.

220
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:50,534
Jay, I can't keep giving this to you

221
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:52,369
if it's hurting you.

222
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:54,237
If it'll help me defeat Geomancer,

223
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,239
you might have to.

224
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:57,474
Till Barry gets back,

225
00:08:57,476 --> 00:09:00,076
I may be the only chance this city has.

226
00:09:04,283 --> 00:09:05,448
I don't know how this is possible,

227
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,783
but you somehow made basketball

228
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:08,084
sound more boring than baseball.

229
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:09,419
Fix this.

230
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,954
Scott Evans, your new editor.

231
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:13,423
- Oh, Iris...
- West, I know.

232
00:09:13,425 --> 00:09:15,358
You wrote the story about
the recent Geomancer attack.

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,993
- Yeah, I did.
- I'm not running that.

234
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,695
What, why?

235
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:20,964
It's a fluff piece to try
to make people feel good.

236
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:23,166
What they need to know is the truth;

237
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:26,803
The Flash might not always
be there to save them.

238
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:28,271
You disagree?

239
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:30,373
I think that he's saved a lot of people

240
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,708
in this city.

241
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,776
But where is he now?

242
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:35,512
I need to run a real story.

243
00:09:35,514 --> 00:09:36,947
Okay, uh...

244
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,481
what if I could get you an exclusive

245
00:09:38,483 --> 00:09:41,117
with the meta-human that fought Geomancer?

246
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,321
This... this other Flash.

247
00:09:44,323 --> 00:09:47,390
What, you friends with him too?

248
00:09:47,392 --> 00:09:50,727
Just, um, give me a little time.

249
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:52,662
Fine, but if it's the same

250
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:54,097
as the other crap that you wrote,

251
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,999
I'm gonna run something about how The Flash

252
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:58,635
may not be the hero we all dreamed he was.

253
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:10,614
Iris... Hey, Iris.

254
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,716
Barry, where were you last night?

255
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:13,850
Oh, my God.

256
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,185
My father died yesterday,

257
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:16,920
and you never even came home.

258
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:18,855
I know, I know. I heard.

259
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:19,856
I'm so, so sorry.

260
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:20,924
You... you heard?

261
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:22,525
You were there, Barry.

262
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:24,094
I actually was not there.

263
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,595
I'm... I'm gonna... yeah, okay.

264
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:26,863
Okay, look.

265
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:28,231
Come to my lab. Just come up to my lab.

266
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,532
I'm gonna explain everything, okay?

267
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:31,534
I'm gonna explain it.

268
00:10:31,536 --> 00:10:34,771
So the Barry from yesterday was not you?

269
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:36,439
No.

270
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:37,907
No, look, I... I know

271
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:40,243
that this is hard to believe,

272
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:42,779
but I mean, it is just like
that sci-fi series,

273
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,781
“Commander Carl, Space
Marshal of the Galaxy, ”

274
00:10:44,783 --> 00:10:46,783
where Carl gets sucked into a black hole

275
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:47,984
and ends up on another planet

276
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,286
that he thinks is Earth,

277
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:51,121
but really it's Earth...

278
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:54,291
of another universe.

279
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:56,159
Have... have you guys not s...

280
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:57,193
oh, it's a seminal episode.

281
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:58,995
You should check it out.

282
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:00,363
So that's why you weren't wearing

283
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,931
your wedding ring yesterday.

284
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,266
Well...

285
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:05,635
And... and that...
that kiss was... was so...

286
00:11:05,637 --> 00:11:07,570
I'm... I'm sorry. He got frisky with you?

287
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:09,906
No, no, no, no, no.

288
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:11,207
Okay, I'm gonna have to find this guy

289
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:12,475
and give him a piece of my mind.

290
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:13,943
Don't give him too much.

291
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,712
Your husband tells us
you've been tracking Zoom.

292
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,447
Yeah, I've been trying to. Why?

293
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:19,182
- We need to find his lair.
- Lair?

294
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:20,750
He's a bad guy; I'm calling it a lair.

295
00:11:20,752 --> 00:11:22,185
Zoom is looking for you.

296
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:23,520
Why are you going after him?

297
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:25,221
Zoom has my daughter

298
00:11:25,223 --> 00:11:27,991
and our Barry, and we need
to rescue them both.

299
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:29,959
Look, I want to find Zoom

300
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:32,796
just as much as anybody,
but no one can track him.

301
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:36,066
The only person who would know
where he would be hiding someone

302
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:38,335
would be a meta that's worked with him.

303
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:40,603
A meta like Killer Frost?

304
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:41,871
Yeah, maybe.

305
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:44,274
But Zoom kept her alive yesterday

306
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:46,042
because she always obeys him.

307
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:48,345
There is no way that she's
gonna tell you where he is.

308
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:49,979
I'm not so sure about that.

309
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:53,483
If she loved Deathstorm as much
as my Caitlin loved Ronnie,

310
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:57,454
I think she'd be more than upset
at Zoom for killing him.

311
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:01,057
Look, finding her is gonna be
just as hard as finding Zoom.

312
00:12:02,794 --> 00:12:05,462
But if anyone can do it...

313
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,833
My husband can.

314
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:11,134
Right, yes.

315
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:13,136
I can, actually.

316
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:15,605
Um, all right.

317
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:22,112
Okay, well it looks like
Patty Spivot was a CSI tech

318
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:23,847
on most of the Killer Frost cases.

319
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:25,448
She's pretty thorough, so...

320
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,716
What's that?

321
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:28,318
Oh, this is Killer Frost meta-data

322
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,186
collected from numerous crime scenes...

323
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:32,589
DNA trace movements, facial recognition,

324
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:34,858
temperature fluctuations specific to her.

325
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,160
My algorithm compiles all the data

326
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:38,895
and gives us an approximate location.

327
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:41,364
It works on most metas,
except for Zoom, of course.

328
00:12:41,366 --> 00:12:44,334
He's too fast... never leaves a trace.

329
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,935
Okay.

330
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:49,339
Looks like the best bet's the woodlands.

331
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:51,007
Best CSI in Central City.

332
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,242
You know where that is, right?

333
00:12:52,244 --> 00:12:54,344
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

334
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:55,678
Wait, I'm going with you guys.

335
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,013
You're gonna need some help. Okay.

336
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:58,314
Iris, I...

337
00:12:58,316 --> 00:12:59,883
Barry, Zoom and his followers

338
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:02,318
are the reason that my father is dead.

339
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,054
If I can stop him from killing anyone else,

340
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:07,090
I'm gonna try.

341
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:09,959
Okay, then I'm coming too.

342
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,862
- No.
- No.

343
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:17,400
Barry, this is not what you do.

344
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:19,569
I know that.

345
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:22,071
But I also know Joseph
didn't like me too much,

346
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:24,274
but he was my father-in-law.

347
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:26,342
If you're going,

348
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:27,844
I am coming with you.

349
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,715
All right.

350
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:35,518
You can come, but you stay out of our way.

351
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:44,994
That's not Morse code.

352
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,566
I know he's trying to tell us something.

353
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:52,502
We just have to find the pattern.

354
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:00,710
There's no pattern, Barry.

355
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:07,917
You know, your dad, who I'm pretty sure

356
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,321
is one of the smartest people
to live on either of our Earths,

357
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:15,024
told me the only person smarter than him

358
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:18,561
was you.

359
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:19,762
He said that?

360
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,466
If that's true,

361
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:26,002
we work together...

362
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:28,071
I know we can figure this out.

363
00:14:32,143 --> 00:14:33,877
Worth a shot?

364
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:39,349
Okay.

365
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:49,926
Well, he never goes past five.

366
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:51,694
What?

367
00:14:51,696 --> 00:14:53,997
He never goes past five knocks
without pausing.

368
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:55,999
Right? Listen.

369
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:06,609
Hey, you're right.

370
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:11,915
I think...

371
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:13,449
I think I know what that is.

372
00:15:13,451 --> 00:15:16,819
It's a five-by-five tap code used by POWs.

373
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:18,855
That would only get us to 25 letters,

374
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:20,323
and there's 26 in the alphabet.

375
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:21,858
Not if you combine C and K.

376
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,827
They sound the same.

377
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:25,962
Let's try it out.

378
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:32,569
- Worth a shot.
- All right.

379
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,105
There it is.

380
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:37,674
Looks different than before.

381
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:38,942
That's because I realized
that there was a flaw

382
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:40,443
with Velocity-8,

383
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:43,780
so I reformulated
the extracellular matrix, and...

384
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:45,214
Velocity-9.

385
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:46,382
You know what they say,

386
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:47,617
ninth time's the charm.

387
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,852
Hey.

388
00:15:49,854 --> 00:15:52,021
Hey, Iris. You okay?

389
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:54,924
Yeah, I'm just a little
worried about the time.

390
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:56,693
Well, don't worry.

391
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:59,095
They'll make it back before
we close the breach.

392
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:01,397
Um, actually I was here

393
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,066
to talk to you about something else.

394
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,534
Oh. Yeah, sure.

395
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:05,735
What is it?

396
00:16:05,737 --> 00:16:07,804
Well, my new editor

397
00:16:07,806 --> 00:16:10,273
wants me to write a scathing article

398
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:13,142
on The Flash not being able
to protect Central City

399
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:14,444
from Geomancer.

400
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:15,678
Really?

401
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,146
Yeah.

402
00:16:17,148 --> 00:16:21,985
I was hoping to write
an article about you instead...

403
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:23,820
something that would calm people

404
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:26,089
until Barry got back.

405
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:27,590
You know, Iris,

406
00:16:27,592 --> 00:16:29,626
I don't know if that's the best idea.

407
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:31,427
Well, I think that if people

408
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,796
knew that there was someone
that could protect them,

409
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:35,164
it would...

410
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,533
it would really help.

411
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:40,837
Would you just think about it?

412
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,210
Some crazy alarm's going off.

413
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:49,012
Yeah.

414
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:51,481
Don't even think about running.

415
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:53,383
There's a new Flash in town.

416
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:56,386
You know, the one with the shiny helmet.

417
00:16:56,388 --> 00:16:59,055
Not the speedster I was hoping to crack,

418
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:01,624
but let's see just how fast he is,

419
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:03,626
Central City.

420
00:17:10,335 --> 00:17:11,768
Give me the Velocity-9.

421
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,436
Jay, we have no idea how long it will last.

422
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:14,604
We don't have time to
figure that out, Caitlin.

423
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,724
Jay?

424
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:07,059
I'm okay.

425
00:18:07,061 --> 00:18:08,260
That just took a lot out of me.

426
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,329
But it sure felt good.

427
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,634
That was amazing, Jay.

428
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,469
Thanks. I kind of surprised myself,

429
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,438
to be honest.

430
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,073
Caitlin deserves all the credit.

431
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:23,141
Looks like your Velocity-9's a winner.

432
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,943
I still need to run some tests.

433
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:28,146
Iris, about the interview, um...

434
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:31,550
I think that I have everything that I need.

435
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:33,864
Great.

436
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:36,567
'Cause I could really use a nap.

437
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:38,535
I'll, uh, be downstairs.

438
00:18:47,113 --> 00:18:49,213
Two down, five across.

439
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,482
- It's J.
- J?

440
00:18:51,484 --> 00:18:54,718
That's what you're tapping... the letter J?

441
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,620
All right, what's next?

442
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:01,258
A.

443
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,459
All right.

444
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,896
Five down...

445
00:19:07,867 --> 00:19:10,834
Four across. Y.

446
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:12,636
J-A-Y?

447
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:15,072
You're spelling “Jay.”

448
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:17,641
As in Jay Garrick?

449
00:19:17,643 --> 00:19:20,110
He's... he's alive.

450
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:21,879
But he's on my Earth.

451
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:25,249
Hey, hey...

452
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,184
Stop, stop... hey...

453
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:28,119
Stop... look, I'm sorry.

454
00:19:28,158 --> 00:19:29,757
I don't know what you mean.

455
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,860
Jay Garrick didn't come with us.

456
00:19:32,862 --> 00:19:35,129
Look, just keep tapping, please.

457
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:37,498
We don't understand.

458
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,434
Please.

459
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:45,406
Don't talk to them again.

460
00:20:05,328 --> 00:20:07,528
I'm gonna get out of here.

461
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,130
And I'm gonna destroy you.

462
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:15,369
All I need from you is your speed, Flash.

463
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:17,738
And you only need to be barely alive

464
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,241
for me to get it.

465
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,946
Stop!

466
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,222
Stop!

467
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:45,132
Barry...

468
00:20:45,134 --> 00:20:47,835
Barry, are you okay?

469
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:49,237
Yeah.

470
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:52,573
I'm okay.

471
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:01,882
Zoom just showed me how to
get out of this thing.

472
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,593
You're sure this is the place?

473
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,866
This is definitely the place.

474
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:20,835
You lost?

475
00:21:20,837 --> 00:21:23,070
Or just back for more fun?

476
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,605
We just came here to talk.

477
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:26,607
Oh, really?

478
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,876
Do you bring your little toys

479
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:31,012
to every conversation you have?

480
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:34,081
Or do you just want to see me burn again?

481
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,617
Considering you killed my father,

482
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:38,119
the thought has crossed my mind.

483
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:39,920
Tell us...

484
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:42,089
where does Zoom keep his prisoners?

485
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:44,258
You really don't know
how to use your abilities,

486
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,459
do you, breacher?

487
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:48,229
It's a work in progress, Elsa.

488
00:21:52,468 --> 00:21:55,036
Zoom killed the love of your life.

489
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,904
This hurts,

490
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:59,307
even for somebody with
a heart as cold as yours.

491
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:02,176
And you think that would
make me turn on Zoom?

492
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:04,145
Enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?

493
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:08,516
What... don't tell me it doesn't
work like that over here.

494
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:10,151
If I tell you,

495
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,420
he'll kill me.

496
00:22:12,422 --> 00:22:14,455
But if I kill you

497
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:17,291
and take you to him,

498
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:20,728
I bet he'd be pretty pleased with me.

499
00:22:22,532 --> 00:22:25,032
Maybe even let me off my leash.

500
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:27,101
So take a wild guess.

501
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:29,170
What do you think I'm gonna choose?

502
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,438
Move!

503
00:22:32,942 --> 00:22:35,209
Argh! That did not go as planned!

504
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:36,477
Her name starts with Killer.

505
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,713
This comes as a shock to you?

506
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:42,650
- We got to move now!
- Yeah, yeah.

507
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,285
- I will cover you.
- Okay.

508
00:22:44,287 --> 00:22:45,820
No, no, no, hey, that's a horrible idea.

509
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,688
Hey, no! Hey, hey, no!

510
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,523
Hey, guys...

511
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:50,624
Where are we going?

512
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,093
Where are we going? Oh, God.

513
00:22:57,166 --> 00:22:59,567
Argh!

514
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:06,674
Argh!

515
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,809
Stop...

516
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:11,011
or you'll never make another icicle again.

517
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:29,001
I can't believe it.

518
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:31,337
What is it?

519
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:34,173
I think I figured out
how to save Jay's life.

520
00:23:35,176 --> 00:23:37,510
Hey, Jay... uh, wake up.

521
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:40,279
Come to the cortex. It's important.

522
00:23:40,281 --> 00:23:42,882
It certainly is.

523
00:23:45,887 --> 00:23:47,386
What do you want?

524
00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:51,090
I like to watch heroes fall

525
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:52,858
and never get back up.

526
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,560
He always gets back up.

527
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:57,563
Hard to do that when the Earth
swallows you whole.

528
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,679
Where is it?

529
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:15,981
Aw, don't go.

530
00:24:15,983 --> 00:24:19,085
We're having so much fun.

531
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,023
Oh, my God! Caitlin!

532
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:28,127
Caitlin, are you okay?

533
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,632
Looks like this new Flash

534
00:24:33,634 --> 00:24:35,434
isn't much of a hero after all.

535
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:41,874
Let's see what a seven
will do to S.T.A.R. Labs.

536
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:54,854
Nice shot.

537
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:56,789
I was aiming for his leg.

538
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:02,261
Where is Zoom's lair?

539
00:25:03,764 --> 00:25:05,731
Where is it?

540
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,566
If I tell you,

541
00:25:07,568 --> 00:25:09,235
he will kill me.

542
00:25:09,237 --> 00:25:11,303
He'll kill you anyway, Caitlin.

543
00:25:11,305 --> 00:25:14,874
Stop calling me that. It's not my name.

544
00:25:14,876 --> 00:25:16,609
Yes, it is.

545
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:18,210
You just don't want to hear it
because it reminds you

546
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:20,346
of someone you used to be.

547
00:25:20,348 --> 00:25:22,982
Trust me, I know that person very well.

548
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:25,251
You don't know anything about me.

549
00:25:25,253 --> 00:25:28,287
I know the Caitlin Snow on my Earth.

550
00:25:28,289 --> 00:25:30,422
I know that when she loves someone,

551
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:31,690
that person is her world.

552
00:25:31,692 --> 00:25:34,026
That person was Ronnie Raymond.

553
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:35,594
And he died too.

554
00:25:35,596 --> 00:25:36,929
It devastated her,

555
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:38,864
and I can see it's doing the same to you.

556
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:44,703
Zoom took that.

557
00:25:44,705 --> 00:25:47,873
His daughter... my friend...

558
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,276
he's gonna take them away from us,

559
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:52,745
just like he took Ronnie from you.

560
00:25:54,815 --> 00:25:58,417
Caitlin...

561
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:01,353
all you have to do is tell us
where he's keeping them.

562
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:03,055
And then you'll never hear from us again,

563
00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:04,990
and you can go.

564
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:11,664
Please.

565
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:15,968
Fine.

566
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,370
I'll show you where it is.

567
00:26:18,372 --> 00:26:20,940
But that's it.

568
00:26:20,942 --> 00:26:23,542
Uh, where are we going?

569
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:25,444
Ascension Cliffs.

570
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,285
Argh!

571
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:34,720
Gah!

572
00:26:34,722 --> 00:26:36,755
Look, are you sure you
want to keep doing that?

573
00:26:36,757 --> 00:26:37,756
You know, if Zoom catches you,

574
00:26:37,758 --> 00:26:39,425
he's gonna hurt you again.

575
00:26:39,427 --> 00:26:42,228
I don't understand why
I can't phase through this.

576
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,530
Well, your body would need
to have the same resonance

577
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:47,066
as the glass walls.

578
00:26:47,068 --> 00:26:48,734
I should be going more than fast enough.

579
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:51,470
It's something else.

580
00:26:51,472 --> 00:26:53,305
Maybe you're resonating
at a different frequency.

581
00:26:56,877 --> 00:27:00,112
Yeah, your Earth vibrates at
a different frequency than mine.

582
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:03,983
Same reason Cisco can't vibe.

583
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:07,353
Is there any way to make up the difference?

584
00:27:07,355 --> 00:27:10,990
Only if I can go faster.

585
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:25,638
Wow, wow, wow.

586
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,506
We're going up there?

587
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:29,441
That's where Zoom's lair is.

588
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:31,610
A place only a speedster could get to.

589
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:33,379
There are like the Cliffs of Insanity.

590
00:27:35,116 --> 00:27:37,516
So how do we get up there?

591
00:27:37,518 --> 00:27:41,520
I can make you something
to climb on, darling.

592
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:42,921
Are you serious?

593
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:44,390
You want us to...

594
00:27:44,392 --> 00:27:47,826
what, just climb to the top
of those cliffs...

595
00:27:47,828 --> 00:27:50,496
on ice?

596
00:27:50,498 --> 00:27:53,332
Got any better ideas?

597
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:55,434
No, ma'am, I'm just, you know, I...

598
00:27:55,436 --> 00:27:57,703
I've got... you know,
I'm wearing wingtips here.

599
00:27:57,705 --> 00:27:59,938
They, um, don't have much tread.

600
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,173
Barry.

601
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:02,975
Barry, um, maybe you should stay behind.

602
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:05,444
- Yeah?
- No... hey, no.

603
00:28:05,446 --> 00:28:07,379
I'm not letting you go up there by yourself.

604
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,848
It is okay if you don't want to go...

605
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,017
if you don't want to do this.

606
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:14,353
You are my wife.

607
00:28:14,355 --> 00:28:17,356
I'm not leaving your side.

608
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:18,657
- Okay.
- Can we go?

609
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,826
- Yeah.
- I'm ready.

610
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:23,228
Let's go before I change my mind.

611
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:34,273
You really think handcuffs can stop me?

612
00:28:34,275 --> 00:28:35,507
I know they can...

613
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:37,576
just like this boot on your neck.

614
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:39,044
It dampens your power.

615
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:40,846
Same goes for the six-by-six cell

616
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:43,515
you'll be calling home at Iron Heights.

617
00:28:43,517 --> 00:28:44,917
All right, let's go.

618
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:47,920
Caitlin.

619
00:28:47,922 --> 00:28:49,588
So sorry I didn't come sooner.

620
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,857
That's okay, um...

621
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:53,292
can I show you something?

622
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:59,865
My cells...

623
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,100
they've stopped degenerating?

624
00:29:01,102 --> 00:29:03,102
How is this even possible?

625
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,937
It appears that when the Velocity-9

626
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:06,805
is in your system, it kick-starts

627
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:09,441
your latent regenerative capabilities,

628
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:12,010
and your cells repair themselves.

629
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:14,947
And do you think you can
get this to work permanently?

630
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:18,817
I don't know, but I think
we're on the right track.

631
00:29:18,819 --> 00:29:21,420
Caitlin, I don't know what to say.

632
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:24,890
This is... you are...

633
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:29,628
What was that?

634
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,063
The speed cannon.

635
00:29:31,065 --> 00:29:32,798
Geomancer's tremors must have damaged it.

636
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,999
Okay, come on.

637
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:36,301
Come on!

638
00:29:46,514 --> 00:29:47,913
The breach isn't stabilized.

639
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:49,615
We need to fix this fast.

640
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:52,351
Otherwise they're never
gonna be able to come back.

641
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:06,091
So that was the sound that we heard.

642
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:08,760
Please tell me it's not as bad as it looks.

643
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:12,564
- Uh...
- Come on, seriously?

644
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:14,499
They still have an hour left.

645
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,235
What if they're trying to get
through the breach right now

646
00:30:16,237 --> 00:30:17,536
and they can't?

647
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,404
Okay, the jolt disrupted the quark matter.

648
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:21,506
The electromagnetic insulators are failing.

649
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,442
How do we fix this in time?

650
00:30:23,444 --> 00:30:25,477
I don't know if we can.

651
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:39,791
Barry?

652
00:30:43,063 --> 00:30:46,431
Barry?

653
00:30:50,037 --> 00:30:51,303
Cisco?

654
00:30:51,305 --> 00:30:53,272
Dude, we made it.

655
00:30:53,274 --> 00:30:55,907
How did you find this place?

656
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:59,177
Had some help.

657
00:30:59,179 --> 00:31:02,080
Don't even get me started on this guy.

658
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:03,181
Oh boy.

659
00:31:05,619 --> 00:31:07,452
Dr. Wells...

660
00:31:10,057 --> 00:31:12,090
Stand back.

661
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:29,141
I'm here.

662
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:31,677
I'm here.

663
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,046
Come on, let's get you out of here.

664
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:36,048
Okay.

665
00:31:39,887 --> 00:31:42,487
- Frost?
- A little help?

666
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:43,488
Not part of the deal.

667
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,223
- Frost!
- Hey, hey, hey.

668
00:31:45,225 --> 00:31:46,658
Bringing us up here wasn't
part of the deal, either,

669
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,527
but here you are.

670
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:51,330
Something tells me you're not
as cold as I thought you were.

671
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:53,865
Maybe, maybe not.

672
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:13,518
What's going on?
Why... why isn't it working?

673
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,753
I don't know.

674
00:32:14,755 --> 00:32:17,089
I've never had this problem before.

675
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,994
Dr. Wells...

676
00:32:22,996 --> 00:32:24,696
Carbyne.

677
00:32:24,698 --> 00:32:26,732
It's some form of carbyne.

678
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:28,333
This cell's made out of
some form of carbyne.

679
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:30,302
You'll never be able to
freeze him out of there.

680
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:31,703
You can't phase out of there?

681
00:32:34,508 --> 00:32:36,241
Just go, all right?

682
00:32:36,243 --> 00:32:37,876
Before Zoom comes back.

683
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:39,745
We're not leaving you here.

684
00:32:39,747 --> 00:32:41,713
I can't get out of this cell.

685
00:32:41,715 --> 00:32:43,148
I've tried

686
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,616
a lot.

687
00:32:44,618 --> 00:32:46,618
I'm not fast enough to phase through this.

688
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,986
You got...

689
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:49,388
just leave, all right?

690
00:32:55,896 --> 00:32:57,529
Just leave.

691
00:33:01,468 --> 00:33:04,803
Do you know what we did

692
00:33:04,805 --> 00:33:07,539
to get here, Barry?

693
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:10,709
We convinced her...

694
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:12,210
Killer Frost...

695
00:33:12,212 --> 00:33:13,712
to show us the way.

696
00:33:13,714 --> 00:33:16,915
Then we climbed some insanely steep cliffs

697
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:18,850
outside on footholds made of ice...

698
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:20,018
ice!

699
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,686
And all of us risked our lives,

700
00:33:21,688 --> 00:33:24,623
knowing Zoom was after us,
to rescue Jesse...

701
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:27,058
and you.

702
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,728
Now, I don't know you,

703
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,463
and you don't know me,

704
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:34,266
but I can tell you that today,

705
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:38,003
I... I did things that
I never thought possible,

706
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:39,971
because I needed to prove to my wife

707
00:33:39,973 --> 00:33:42,474
and to myself that I could.

708
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:46,745
Now, if I can do the impossible today,

709
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:49,281
so can you.

710
00:33:51,718 --> 00:33:54,553
I'm just Barry Allen,

711
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:55,987
but you're The Flash.

712
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,963
If you tell yourself

713
00:34:04,965 --> 00:34:07,065
you can phase out of there,

714
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,800
you'll do it.

715
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:53,245
Okay, let's go.

716
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:54,746
Go, come on. Wait, wait!

717
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,147
Hey, hey, hey! We're not leaving him.

718
00:34:56,149 --> 00:34:57,582
Barry, there's no time.

719
00:34:57,584 --> 00:35:00,318
He's not going anywhere,

720
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,289
and neither are any of you.

721
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:05,624
Thank you

722
00:35:05,626 --> 00:35:08,293
for bringing them to me.

723
00:35:08,295 --> 00:35:10,295
You double-crossed us?

724
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:12,030
He killed Ronnie!

725
00:35:12,032 --> 00:35:15,634
Guess my heart is as cold
as you thought after all.

726
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:17,736
I can't believe you.

727
00:35:17,738 --> 00:35:19,971
Just so you know,
you would be very disappointed

728
00:35:19,973 --> 00:35:22,240
in you right now.

729
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:23,842
Zoom.

730
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:26,411
Let them go.

731
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:28,747
All you need is me and Barry.

732
00:35:28,749 --> 00:35:30,482
You're right.

733
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:34,419
I may not be able to kill you yet,

734
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:36,955
but I can kill them.

735
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:42,460
No, no! No...

736
00:35:42,462 --> 00:35:45,797
I told you I'd kill you
in front of your father.

737
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:47,365
No! No!

738
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:52,571
No...

739
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:55,941
Get out of here.

740
00:36:00,147 --> 00:36:01,379
Caitlin.

741
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:03,048
You were right.

742
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,050
He killed Ronnie.

743
00:36:05,052 --> 00:36:06,418
Thank you.

744
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:11,356
I'm not leaving without him.

745
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:13,058
Barry, there's no time.

746
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,859
There's no time!

747
00:36:14,861 --> 00:36:16,795
I can't hold him forever.

748
00:36:16,797 --> 00:36:19,731
Hey, I'm coming back for you
when this is over, all right?

749
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:20,899
Go!

750
00:36:20,901 --> 00:36:22,067
I'm coming back!

751
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:31,292
Jay, we need to do something.

752
00:36:31,353 --> 00:36:33,587
Our only chance is to reboot
the electromagnetic insulators

753
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,197
and hope the quark matter
redistributes equally.

754
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,198
How do we do that?

755
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,666
We have to do it manually.

756
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:40,001
But you can't be near the stabilizer rings

757
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:41,069
when they power on, or you'll get

758
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:42,337
sucked into the breach.

759
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:43,371
Not if I create a vortex

760
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:44,739
to counteract the pull.

761
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:46,240
You can't do both at the same time.

762
00:36:46,242 --> 00:36:48,276
Cait...

763
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:49,978
I have to try.

764
00:36:52,382 --> 00:36:54,315
I'll help you.

765
00:36:54,317 --> 00:36:55,516
What? Dad, no.

766
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:56,718
Look, if it brings Barry

767
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,719
back to this Earth, I'm doing it.

768
00:36:57,721 --> 00:36:58,720
Are you sure?

769
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,291
The more we talk about it,
the less sure I'll be,

770
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,079
so let's just do it.

771
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,819
Okay.

772
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,887
There's an override switch
on every stabilizer ring.

773
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,547
- I'll create the vortex.
- Yeah.

774
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:08,981
And you flip all of them.
They should all reboot.

775
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:10,416
Got it.

776
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:11,385
Once that's done, you power up the cannon.

777
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:13,266
- The breach should stabilize.
- And what if it doesn't?

778
00:37:13,988 --> 00:37:16,856
We're all out of luck.

779
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,271
The Velocity-9 is running out!

780
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:01,601
Jay!

781
00:38:01,603 --> 00:38:03,035
I guess now we know how long

782
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:05,571
the Velocity-9 lasts.

783
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:07,507
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

784
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:08,908
Yeah.

785
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,476
I just hope they are.

786
00:38:16,584 --> 00:38:18,050
I'm fine. I'm just a mess.

787
00:38:18,052 --> 00:38:20,086
You need to get out
of Central City, all right?

788
00:38:20,088 --> 00:38:22,388
Any place you think
you'll be safe from Zoom.

789
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,923
Yeah, we, um... we have some family

790
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:25,057
in Atlantis that can help us.

791
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:26,425
Yeah, okay, good.

792
00:38:26,427 --> 00:38:27,693
You may not have been struck by lightning

793
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:28,928
over here like I was,

794
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,396
but today, you risked your life

795
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:32,465
to save somebody you didn't even know.

796
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:35,034
That's a hero, Barry.

797
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:37,436
Thank you both.

798
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:39,138
Barry...

799
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,808
is my father still alive on your Earth?

800
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,045
Yeah, he is.

801
00:38:46,047 --> 00:38:48,881
Give him a hug for me, will you?

802
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:49,916
I will.

803
00:38:57,192 --> 00:38:58,524
Hey.

804
00:38:58,526 --> 00:39:00,092
You guys need to get someplace safe too.

805
00:39:00,094 --> 00:39:01,561
Where are you going?

806
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:03,462
The only place we can.

807
00:39:07,068 --> 00:39:09,569
- Dad, we can't just leave.
- We have to, honey.

808
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:11,904
What, you want me to leave
everything I have here?

809
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:13,339
My friends, my family...

810
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:14,740
I mean, my life.

811
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:16,142
You don't have a life here anymore.

812
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:17,376
Either do I.

813
00:39:17,378 --> 00:39:18,911
Zoom is too powerful.

814
00:39:18,913 --> 00:39:20,146
I can't stop him.

815
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:22,248
And as long as he is here,

816
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,549
he's gonna hunt us down

817
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:24,817
until we're dead.

818
00:39:27,422 --> 00:39:30,089
Wells, if you're coming
with us, we have to go.

819
00:39:36,264 --> 00:39:38,431
It's almost time.

820
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:39,899
I don't care what time it is.

821
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:42,268
After all we did to stabilize this breach,

822
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:45,037
we're not closing until they show up.

823
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:46,472
Y'all hear me?

824
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,377
Cisco!

825
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:53,179
Get ready to close the breach for good...

826
00:39:53,181 --> 00:39:54,347
Zoom's coming!

827
00:39:57,819 --> 00:40:01,854
Forgetting someone, Flash?

828
00:40:01,856 --> 00:40:03,089
Let him go.

829
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:05,858
Close the breach.

830
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,327
Tell Jesse I love her.

831
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:09,795
Tell her yourself.

832
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:11,964
Argh!

833
00:40:16,371 --> 00:40:18,070
It shouldn't be taking this long.

834
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:24,977
Close it! Close it now!

835
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,750
You did it... you made it!

836
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:34,520
Barry.

837
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,732
No!
