17
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:05,130
My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive.

18
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,550
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

19
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,300
But secretly, with the help of my friends

20
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,270
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

21
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,660
I fight crime

22
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,180
and find other meta-humans like me.

23
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,410
But when my daughter came back from the future to help,

24
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,010
she changed the present.

25
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,480
And now our world is more dangerous than ever,

26
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,060
and I'm the only one fast enough to save it.

27
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,410
I am The Flash.

28
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,160
Previously on "The Flash"...

29
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,240
Who's Cicada?

31
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,030
You'll never catch him.

32
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,190
This is Sherloque.

33
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,180
He's the greatest detective in all the multiverse.

34
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,350
I'm a detective as well.

35
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,890
I'm here to catch your killer.

36
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,100
So we're dealing with a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

37
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,050
In my history,

38
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,700
he never killed Gridlock or Block.

39
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,410
They're completely different victims.

40
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,780
- He's early. - Because the timeline changed.

41
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,000
Because of me.

43
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,470
Guys, this is mad crazy!

44
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,020
There are, like, fireballs in the sky!

45
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,930
Holy--

46
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,390
I'm gonna get a better look.

47
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,060
There he is! This is gonna be lit.

48
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,080
Wait, there's two of them?

49
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,390
Oh, my God, guys. What was that?

50
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,650
This is cray! What is going on right now?

51
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,100
Is the world, like, ending right now?

52
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,710
Oh, my phone.

53
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,240
You just saved my life.

54
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,880
You are the second speedster

55
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,610
who just, like, saved the world.

56
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,460
Can I just get a-- can I just get a...

57
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,140
selfie.

58
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,570
What the...

59
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,800
*I come home in the morning light*

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,630
*My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right?"*

61
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,240
*Oh, Mother dear, we're not the fortunate ones*

62
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,400
*And girls, they wanna have fun*

63
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,040
*Oh, girls just wanna have*

64
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,640
*That's all they really want*

66
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,290
*Some fun*

67
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,010
*When the working day is done*

69
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,110
Sorry.

70
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,310
- What are you doing? - Uh, nothing. Go back to bed.

71
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,070
I'm just making some breakfast.

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,090
Like I could go to sleep

73
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,160
after the smell of Jitters coffee.

74
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,790
So, uh, I see you still know your way around the kitchen.

75
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,460
What's happening?

76
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,470
- Uh, hey, babe. - Good morning.

77
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,430
Um, I, um, was thinking

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,760
that we could have breakfast together.

79
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Right? Like a family.

80
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,320
- I love it. - Yeah.

81
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,930
Do you--Hi.

82
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,010
Do you need any help?

83
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,180
No, no. You guys just sit.

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,810
Okay.

85
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,360
What...do we have here?

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,380
Well, these are pancakes, as you can see,

87
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,430
but I made them into little lightning bolts.

88
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,250
Well, the batter kind of got away from me,

89
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,400
but you see the little zigzag--

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,530
No, no, no. Yeah, yeah. I totally see it, yeah.

91
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,910
Yeah.

92
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,540
What are--what are you doing?

93
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,370
Uh, I am just getting evidence

94
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,880
that you make lumpy pancakes in every time period.

95
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,610
Let's try it out.

96
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,230
Mmm. Lumpy, but delicious.

97
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,010
Yeah? Oh, thanks, babe.

98
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,440
I'm sorry, um, when did you-- when did you get a phone?

99
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,680
Uh, Dad got it for me a couple days ago.

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,920
Nora suggested it. I mean, I thought it was a great idea.

101
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,800
We're always in and out of S.T.A.R. Labs, so I just--

102
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,730
you know, it'd be easier to text and call.

103
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,090
Yeah.

104
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,320
Yeah, that totally makes sense.

105
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,170
You guys excited to cheer me on

106
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,500
at the charity softball game?

107
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,520
Softball, schway.

108
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,870
I just hope I don't get stuck in right field this year.

109
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,950
You, uh, gave your number out already?

110
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,020
Yeah, just to the team and Sherloque.

111
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,990
Actually, this text message, I think, is from him.

113
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,720
I don't think he's much of a texter.

114
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,470
No.

115
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,490
He, uh, wants us to come to S.T.A.R. Labs.

116
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,540
I'm gonna go get ready.

117
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,300
You haven't had anything to eat yet.

118
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,840
Mm. I'm not really a breakfast person.

119
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,950
You know, I thought having her here,

120
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,750
we would finally have a chance to connect,

121
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,150
but it's like every time we take a half-step forward,

122
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,920
we end up taking six steps back.

123
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,350
I-I mean, don't give up. She'll come around.

124
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,090
- I have a feeling. - Yeah.

125
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,850
Well, not if I keep making food like that.

126
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,150
Hey, no, this really is good.

127
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,070
It is. I mean, it's a little, like...

128
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,940
- Wait, wait, stop. Just stop. - Dark, but-- No, it's--

129
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm going to make you a banana. It's fine.

130
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,960
You're going to make me a banana?

131
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,370
I'm going to make you a banana.

132
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,230
Thanks.

133
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,990
Wait, no, I asked for everyone.

134
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,370
Where is the little, uh-- -

135
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,420
Cisco is laying low at his parents' house

136
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,810
while he heals up.

137
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,540
Well, that's not very brave on his part.

138
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,420
I will have a conversation with him next time I see him.

139
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,740
So, Team Flash.

140
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,360
How will this handsome, master detective of all the multiverse,

141
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,170
Sherloque Wells,

142
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,540
pay off his debt to us...

143
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,700
and catch this homicidal maniac together?

144
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,230
Well, we'll begin by asking ourselves a few obvious questions.

146
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,110
How he became a meta-human?

147
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,960
Well, power manifestation varies.

148
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,860
The particle accelerator--

149
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,630
- I don't think we're interrupting Sherloque, right? - Right.

150
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,910
Sure, but you bring up a good point, Dr. Snow.

151
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,710
What do we know so far about this Cicada?

152
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,670
Well, we know that he's killed two people

153
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,890
and almost a third.

154
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,900
Exactly right.

155
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,370
If I could gently be a little more specific,

156
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,890
not just people, right?

157
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,530
Meta-humans.

158
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,280
Also, Joe said he got the feeling that Cicada's a dad.

159
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,680
Right. Cicada... parent.

160
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,320
His dagger dampens powers.

161
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,610
Not just dampens the powers, right?

162
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,860
He commands this dagger, right?

163
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,300
It is like an extension of himself.

164
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,570
So we know...

165
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,780
Maybe they acquired their powers at the same time.

166
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,310
Yes, very good, Dr. Snow.

167
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,230
So, acquired powers...

168
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,420
together.

169
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,900
So...

170
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,570
there we are, Team Flash.

171
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,680
Very simple.

172
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,520
We unravel this puzzle,

173
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,310
and we have a pathway to tracking Cicada.

174
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,920
Cool, or we just answer a much more basic question,

175
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,010
like what's up with his weird mask?

176
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,630
Well, the mask conceals his identity.

177
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,790
- That's what it's for. - Right.

178
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,900
What I'm suggesting is,

179
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,220
if we find out what the mask is for,

180
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,260
we'll find out the man underneath much faster.

181
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,140
37 times I have caught Cicada, right?

182
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,100
And not once was this mask angle very useful, right?

184
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,540
But you know what?

185
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,700
The more hours I bill you, the less money I owe you.

186
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,220
So, if you want to spend your hours pursuing the mask angle,

187
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,830
well, then be my guest.

188
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,800
Okay, great. Sounds like a plan.

189
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,820
- We got to get going. Go to the game. - Yeah, yes.

190
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,690
Good stuff.

191
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,150
I hope you score a touchdown.

192
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,990
- It's softball. - Ah, score a basket.

193
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
So, baby giraffe...

194
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,260
lead on, my friend.

195
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,130
Look at these guys.

196
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
They think they're so much better than us.

197
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,510
Because they are, Bar.

198
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,330
I mean, without Captain Singh or my dad, it's--

199
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,600
- Huh, what? - Jonesy isn't here yet.

200
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,990
Hey, Detective Rowell, what do you think?

201
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,440
- Maybe third base for me? - Right field, Allen.

202
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,640
Babe, I love you, but leave the hot corner

203
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,450
to someone who can actually field a ball, okay?

204
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,730
- Play ball! - Come on.

205
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,950
- I mean-- Good luck! - Yeah.

206
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,520
- You're going to nail it. - Right field.

207
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,840
- Oh, God. - In right field.

208
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,860
Not the hot corner, but-- Guys, come on!

209
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,740
Safe!

211
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,890
Wow, he really is slow.

212
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,490
Yeah, Papa Joe told me all the stories

213
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,180
about what an awful athlete Dad was growing up.

214
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,790
Well, believe me, they're true.

215
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,750
Let's just be grateful that he has coordination

216
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,220
when it counts.

217
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,030
Hey, what is that, Nora?

218
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,610
There is this really great app called Spyn Zone.

219
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,490
The push notifications let you know the second

220
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,190
anything happens in the city.

221
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,190
Like Iris' Website?

222
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,830
Uh, yeah, kind of.

223
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,520
It's just a lot more up to date than that,

224
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,120
and it's, like-it's really cool.

225
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,410
This girl's, like, really in the know.

227
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,460
Yeah, Spencer Young. I know her.

228
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,410
Yeah, I see her all the time

229
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,800
working on her laptop at Jitters.

230
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,950
She--she actually was a junior reporter at CCPN

231
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,380
when I worked there, but...

232
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,370
she didn't last very long.

233
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,150
- Why not? - Well, she wanted to be famous

234
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,730
and make a name for herself,

235
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,840
but she didn't care how it happened.

236
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,610
Well, I think she's cute.

237
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,360
Yeah, I mean, she may be cute,

238
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,890
but she's never fact-checked a thing a day in her life.

239
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,520
She's doing something right-she has three times

240
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,410
as many followers on her app as you do on your blogs, so...

241
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm going to get something to eat.

242
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,260
- Ah, come on, Allen! - Oh, honey.

243
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,720
- Cecile? What's wrong? - Something's not right.

244
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,730
Something's not right.

245
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,170
Is that Jonesy?

246
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,870
Hey, somebody stop him!

247
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,230
Everybody move!

248
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,630
- Nora, hey. - Huh? What?

249
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,150
What happened?

250
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,580
You just saved everybody.

251
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,210
Bomb squad finished their sweep.

252
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,150
- They said it's all clear. - Okay.

253
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,650
Nora, how did you know what was happening?

254
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,190
I don't know.

255
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,590
One minute I was going to get food,

256
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,960
and the next I was in the outfield with Dad.

257
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,950
And you don't remember anything else?

259
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,880
What's that?

260
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,920
A notification from Spyn Zone.

262
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,180
Already? That was fast.

263
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,740
Allen, CSI time.

264
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,840
Uh, we're up. We'll meet you back at S.T.A.R. Labs

265
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,190
as soon as we can.

266
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,450
Iris, if Cicada sees that post--

267
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,220
Yeah, he may pick Nora as his next target.

268
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,140
Well, you have brought us to the location

269
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,090
you first encountered Cicada.

270
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,640
That's right. How did you know that?

271
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,400
I know everything. I'm a master detective.

272
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,160
Look, I looked at the CSI file of Barry Allen.

273
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,940
There is no evidence of Cicada DNA, right?

274
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,370
And moreover, look at this location, right?

275
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,520
All the traffic through here--

276
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,300
you can never pull DNA from here.

277
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,670
It's a good thing we're not here for DNA.

278
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,910
What we are here for, then?

279
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,020
We're here to find out why Cicada wears that mask.

280
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,890
Oh, encore with the mask!

281
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,850
Do you think he's allergic to fresh air?

282
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,720
- No. - No, he wears that mask for a reason.

283
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,300
All right, look, 37 times I've caught Cicada.

284
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,590
Not once, not one time was the mask

285
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,620
- a key part of the evidence. - Yeah, that's true.

286
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,580
But you said this Cicada is different than all the others,

287
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,760
so why wouldn't his mask be different, too?

288
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,330
Maybe it's just a mask to-You know what?

289
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,080
You want to pursuit mask angle, be my guest.

290
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,680
What do you expect to find here?

291
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,920
When I was getting my ass kicked,

292
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,860
I noticed that the more he exerted himself,

293
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,320
the heavier his breathing got.

294
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,690
- That's what happens. - So, I thought...

295
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,990
if one of those breaths was strong enough...

296
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,590
We might just get lucky.

297
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,590
How we are going to get lucky?

298
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,210
Barry found traces of fluoropolymers here.

299
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,600
- So? - So the Internet told me

300
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,100
they're prone to flaking.

301
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,540
I'm here to get some of them.

302
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,610
The Internet also tell you to contaminate your crime scene?

303
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,400
Very good, master detective.

304
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,860
Turns out industrial respirators use

305
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,370
a protective coating around the nostrils

306
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,500
that are made from this.

307
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,220
And when this exposed to another compound,

308
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,550
dimethyl sulfate, fluoropolymers tend to emit

309
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,670
a very distinct odor

310
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,040
Burnt onions.

311
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,160
Right.

312
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,780
We find out where this is used,

313
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,450
we're going to find our man.

314
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,400
- Elementary. - Elementary.

315
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,880
No shrap, Sherlock.

316
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,790
It's Sherloque.

317
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,580
Spencer?

318
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,440
Iris West, wow.

319
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
Long time. How are you?

320
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,340
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm good. And you?

321
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,240
Good. Married that CSI guy you were dating, huh?

322
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,400
Uh, yeah.

323
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,500
- Any kids yet? - Um, no. Not--

324
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,750
No.

325
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,440
You know, I followed your lead.

326
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,980
Started my own blog, left CCPN.

327
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,440
Now we are both Charleine Foster Kanes.

329
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,150
Right.

330
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,860
BTdubs, those Professor DeVoe stories--respect.

331
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,040
Metas are clickbait right now, right?

332
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,850
Yes, which is why I wanted to talk to you, actually,

333
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,250
off the record, of course.

334
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,740
Yeah, for sure. What's up?

335
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,690
So, uh, I recently found a source who thinks

336
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,230
that metas are being targeted.

337
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,750
Ooh, juicy. Who?

338
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,870
Well, no one knows, not even CCPD.

339
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,360
But these metas, including speedsters

340
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,790
like The Flash and XS, they are all in danger.

341
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,830
XS. That new lady speedster has a code name.

342
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,600
Oh, like her size!

343
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,750
Right, extra small.

344
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,460
- Did you coin that? - No, no.

345
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,640
Look, the point is, writing articles about XS

346
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,450
could make her a target.

347
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,050
Or it could make her famous.

348
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,400
I mean, people are already obsessed with her...

349
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,710
and my app even more.

350
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,280
Besides, a little threat never stopped you

351
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,640
from writing about The Flash back in the day.

352
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,950
That was different.

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,670
Because it was your blog?

354
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,630
What--do as I say, not as I do?

355
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,370
Look, please stop, okay? Before someone gets hurt.

356
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,000
The only one who's going to get hurt is you

357
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,090
when I make your blog irrelevant.

358
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,450
What is this for, Allen?

359
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,430
Just trying to get some answers, Jonesy.

360
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,080
Would you send that to Caitlin?

361
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,010
I told everyone everything I know, which is nothing.

362
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,230
- You don't remember a thing? - No.

363
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,480
Okay, God's own truth, Allen-- all I remember is waking up,

364
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,470
getting ready for the game, leaving my house,

365
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,950
and the next thing I know, I wake up in the field

366
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,620
after that bomb went off.

367
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,340
I mean, where would I even get a bomb?

368
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,350
The evidence lockup.

369
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,540
It was part of the inventory we seized from the Jansen-Moretti case.

370
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,860
The cameras in the lockup show you stuffing that bomb

371
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,750
in your backpack this morning.

372
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,750
- Joe, no one got hurt. - They could've.

373
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,980
The woman I love, my baby-- you could've killed them.

374
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,120
I watched you come up, man.

375
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,450
I'm sorry, Joe...

376
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,980
but I swear, I don't know how this happened.

377
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,720
Move, move!

378
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,880
- How many we got? - Hey, what is it?

379
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,650
Fire at CCPN. First responders are across town.

380
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,270
We got to go.

382
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,650
Finally.

383
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,760
Okay, the building's already been evacuated.

384
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,090
Fire trucks are on their way.

385
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,230
Okay, let's just get inside and put the fire out.

386
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,030
I've never done this before.

387
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,490
Come on. Seriously, move!

388
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,730
That's okay. We're just going to create a vacuum.

390
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,740
Fine. I will make you move.

391
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,380
Enjoy this news, Flash.

393
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,140
All right, I'll walk you through it. Once we're inside--

395
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,930
What? Where-- where are you going?

396
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,820
- Nora, what's wrong? - He just ran away and left.

397
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,710
His suit's GPS has him west, way west.

398
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,750
Barry? Barry.

399
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,920
He's not listening.

400
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,740
Guys, what do I do here?

401
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,080
Okay, Nora, you're going to have to do this by yourself.

402
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,670
Okay? But I'm going to help you.

403
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,540
Okay.

404
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,250
Okay, you need to get to the heart of the fire

405
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,850
and extinguish it from there.

406
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,360
- I got it. - Rotate your arms in tight circles.

407
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,750
You need to move them in opposite directions,

408
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,600
creating twin vacuums.

409
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,590
Come on, Nora.

410
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,690
Dad's done this a thousand times.

411
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,040
You can do this.

412
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,840
I'm doing it!

413
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,980
Keep going.

414
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,320
Great job, Nora.

415
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,980
Thanks, Mom.

416
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,580
Hey--hey, did you find Dad?

417
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:06,730
What the hell?

418
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,890
I'm glad you were there to put that out.

419
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,840
- It could've been a lot worse. - Thanks, Dad.

420
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
Don't thank me. Your mom walked you through it.

421
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,410
You were really great out there.

422
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,690
So there was some weird activity with your scan,

423
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,460
but everything looks fine.

424
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,450
What's the last thing you remember?

425
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,160
Standing outside CCPN with Nora.

426
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,970
Next thing I know, I'm in Vegas.

427
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,790
That's exactly what happened to me and Officer Jones.

428
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,300
So maybe the abnormal activity

429
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,460
was some sort of hypnotic induction?

430
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,420
I don't know. I mean, I feel like one of us would've noticed

431
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,560
somebody trying to hypnotize me.

432
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,210
Yeah, and why would someone hypnotize us to save people?

433
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,320
Publicity.

434
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,310
Spencer Young wants to get famous by making you famous.

435
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,460
You don't know that.

436
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,180
She admitted it when we talked.

437
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,080
Why would you go talk to her?

438
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,570
Hold on, look at the timestamp on the post.

440
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,460
7:52 p.m.? Nora and I were still with Jonesy,

441
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,460
and the fire at CCPN hadn't even been reported yet.

442
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,220
I guess you'll always be the first one to the scoop

443
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,720
if you're the one making it.

444
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,190
So she's some sort of early edition meta who creates stories?

445
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,610
Fake news taken to a whole new level.

446
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,940
Maybe she's some kind of meta psychic who predicts the news.

447
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,230
That still doesn't mean she hypnotized us.

448
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,430
Yeah.

449
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,380
Caitlin, can you download the cortical biometrics

450
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,590
from Nora's suit and run it against my scans?

451
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,300
- On it. - Thanks.

452
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,950
What are you thinking?

453
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,790
We need to figure out if Spencer's responsible for this.

455
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,280
Google for the win on finding out where Cicada's mask is from.

456
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:56,990
Google for the win.

457
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,870
So you think Cicada's hiding out here,

458
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,450
just lurking behind those doors.

459
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:01,560
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do,

460
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,500
because my search also told me that Szrek Chemicals

461
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,120
uses dimethyl sulfates in most of their products.

462
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,280
So guess what. I'm gonna take down Cicada.

463
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,710
Oh, well, we shall see, giraffe.

464
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,060
May I help you?

465
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,720
- Hi, how are you? I'm-- - Elongated Man. I know.

466
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,740
Sherloque Wells, yes, master detective.

467
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,230
You know, we'll sign autographs later-- we have some business.

468
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,510
We just want to know if we can ask you some questions, please.

469
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,570
About?

470
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,140
What about our masks?

471
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,120
Do any of your employees wear them?

472
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,790
Follow me.

473
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,840
Yep. Every worker, every plant wears one.

474
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,510
How many plants?

475
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,580
Three in Central City and Keystone.

476
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,870
14 in the Midwest alone.

477
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,190
So probably thousands?

478
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,680
Yeah, and we're not the only facility that uses them.

479
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,130
Thank you for your time.

480
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,330
Hey, I, uh...

481
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,240
Love that pear meme going around the last few weeks.

482
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,510
Classic.

483
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,660
Classic. I have a suggestion for you.

484
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,940
Maybe the next time you do a Google search, advance to page two.

485
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,590
So here's the meta-watch, press that button.

486
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,000
If Spencer's a meta, it'll beep.

487
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,580
And if she's meta...

488
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,720
It means she could be dangerous, so come right back.

489
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,970
Yes. One of us would go with you,

490
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:13,750
but she knows both me and your dad, so...

491
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,780
I got it.

492
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,190
Okay, we're here if you need us, all ri--

493
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,580
I see her.

494
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,060
All you need to do is get within five feet of her,

495
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,730
hit the button, in and out.

496
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,650
I know!

497
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
You see what I mean?

498
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,080
Half-step forward, six steps back?

499
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,020
I mean, you guys did great with the fire, though.

500
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,030
Thank you.

501
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,810
You should totally name one of your drinks

502
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,470
after that new female speedster, XS.

503
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,570
Hi. Sorry, Spencer.

504
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,490
That's okay. Do I know you?

505
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,920
Nora...

506
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,650
you have to press the button.

507
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,450
No. No, you don't know me.

508
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,570
But you know me.

509
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,710
Yes, I do. sorry. You're Spencer Young.

510
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,780
I read all your stuff on Spyn Zone.

511
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:05,900
It's a really good app.

512
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,990
It's fantastic stories and really good writing.

513
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,580
I'm a--I'm a really big fan.

514
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,560
- Nora.. - I always enjoy meeting a fan.

515
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,000
Especially when they're as adorable as you.

516
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,340
What's happening?

517
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,210
She's flirting with our daughter. I'll be back.

518
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,220
- What? - Hold down the fort.

519
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,630
Iris, wait.

520
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,260
- Do you have a name? - Nora, hey.

521
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,770
Wait, y-you know her?

522
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,920
I do. Well, she's actually--

523
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,360
This is, actually--

524
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,650
Did you want to check your watch?

525
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,390
I think we're running a little bit late.

526
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,970
- Right, yes. - Yeah.

528
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,680
All right, well, I'm going to peace out.

530
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,020
But I hope to meet cute you again sometime.

531
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,310
Nora.

532
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,530
Well, I guess she's not meta.

533
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,870
I guess not.

534
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,220
Oh, no. No, no, no.

535
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,100
Nora--look, I don't care that you think she's cute.

536
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,620
She's dangerous, okay? You need to stay away from her.

537
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:28,010
She could be dangerous.

538
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:30,740
Nora, I am trying to protect you here.

539
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,750
Has that been your thing my whole life?

540
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,070
What does that even mean, honestly?

541
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,750
I mean, is that why you've been so cold to me,

542
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,250
why you don't want to spend any time with me?

543
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,710
I'm -- I'm just trying to get to know you.

544
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,890
- Just drop it. - Nora, I don't under--

545
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,420
Look, you lied to me!

546
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,590
I would never lie to you.

547
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,260
Yeah? What do you call that?

548
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,150
You put a power-dampening chip inside me

549
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,530
to take away my speed.

550
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,810
And until six months ago,

551
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,060
I didn't even know I had powers.

552
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,860
My whole life has been a lie

553
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,990
because you have been trying to protect me.

554
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,360
Well, guess what. I don't need you to do that.

556
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,090
- What you doing? - Well, Nora blocked me.

557
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,020
So I'm trying to use the quantum computer

558
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,910
to access her phone and force her to accept my calls.

559
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,810
But I am no...

560
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,760
hacker.

561
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,410
Don't you think that's a little extreme?

562
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:45,070
Yes, Barry, it's very extreme...and crazy and desperate,

563
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,940
but I am feeling extremely crazy and desperate, okay?

564
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,640
I thought giving her space would, you know,

565
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:52,940
have her eventually come around,

566
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,190
but it turns out she's not the problem. I am.

567
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,080
I mean, I don't know how I could do something

568
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,220
like that to her, Barry.

569
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,850
Iris, you didn't do anything to her.

570
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,820
You can't blame yourself for something

571
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,110
future-you might do.

572
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,710
Yes, I can, Barry, and it's not a might.

573
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,000
I suppressed our daughter's powers.

574
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,830
I kept a huge part of who she was a secret for her entire life.

575
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,060
I did that.

576
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,160
Look, she'll forgive you.

577
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,170
What if my dad did something like that to you

578
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,470
after the particle accelerator exploded?

579
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,180
See?

580
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,990
I don't understand how I could do something like that to her.

581
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,290
Look, I don't know why you do it,

582
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,520
but I don't need to.

583
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,890
I know that anything you do for our family, it's out of love.

584
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,890
So, whatever reason future-you has for doing this,

585
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,110
I have faith that it's the right thing to do,

586
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,450
and so should you.

587
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,140
Yeah, well, I'm having a really hard time believing that.

588
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,420
Well, then it's a good thing I have enough faith in you

589
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,910
for the both of us.

590
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,640
All right?

591
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,410
That's unusual.

592
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,050
Dr. Snow.

593
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,120
Oh, Dr. Snow.

594
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,140
I have frightened you, Dr. Snow.

595
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,550
I assume you came here for some other reason than murdering me?

596
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,680
Oh, dear God.

597
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,420
If I was to murder you, Dr. Snow,

598
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,460
I would not do it in such an obvious fashion.

599
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,480
Look, I have a theory on the identity of Cicada.

600
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,610
I request your assistance.

601
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,060
Uh, okay. I was just finishing up.

602
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,880
Not your expertise, your assistance.

603
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,730
I need you to punch me in the chest.

604
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,850
What?

605
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,160
Right here, above the--um, dee-aphragm. How do you say?

606
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,200
Diaphragm?

607
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,000
Diaphragm, right.

608
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,160
In the solar plexus as hard as you can. All¨¦.

609
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,980
Listen, Sherlock--

610
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,220
Loque.

611
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,020
So this is one of those things

612
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,930
where you are just the brains and not the brawn?

613
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,360
You don't have the guts. You lack the courage.

614
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,380
You're soft.

615
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,160
Probably you couldn't even hit me in the spot.

616
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,820
For the record, I know what you just did.

617
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,670
And? And it worked.

618
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,920
Tr¨¨s bien. Then... all¨¦.

619
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,940
Are you okay?

620
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,820
You sound just like...

621
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,640
Cicada.

623
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,160
What do we got?

624
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,910
CCPD is getting bombarded with calls from people

625
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,840
at the soccer game at Central City Stadium.

626
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,200
It's all over the news, too.

627
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,230
Okay, I'm going to get over there.

628
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,840
CCPD already cleared out the stadium.

629
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,310
Find the bomb, and we'll help you disarm it.

630
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,400
What's going on?

631
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,150
I'll tell you on the way.Come on.

632
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:00,080
- Nothing, you? - No.

633
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,940
Iris, there's no bomb.

635
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,090
Guys, look at the timestamp on Spencer's post.

636
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,860
11: 05 A.M.

637
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,710
Yeah, and now look at the time that CCPD

638
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,820
got the first call about the bomb sighting.

640
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,360
It was five minutes later.

641
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,500
Hey, can you bring up Officer Jones' brain scan?

642
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,350
I'm going to run the code

643
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,210
of Spencer's post through the decompiler.

644
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,370
Let's see what's underneath.

645
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,870
Got it.

646
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,140
- Done. - The brain scan. The code is an exact match.

648
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,640
- Barry, it's the headlines. - What?

649
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,020
That's how Spencer's hypnotizing people.

650
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,940
They're reading her headlines! Don't look at them.

651
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,660
Too late!

652
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,940
Nora's been hypnotized.

653
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,590
She's trying to kill me.

654
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,360
Nora, you got to snap out of this.

655
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,600
What I have to do is kill you.

656
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,330
Caitlin, take over.

657
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,800
- Where are you going? - To get my family back.

658
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,100
Hurry up and kill him already.

659
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,960
Time to bounce.

660
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,790
Hey, you're going to be okay. All right?

661
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,940
Nice shot!

662
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,830
Guys, do we know where Spencer is?

663
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,970
I can't ping her phone.

664
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,560
CCPD disabled all the cell towers

665
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,940
in the area to prevent a remote bomb detonation.

666
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,810
She must be local in order to put those headlines

667
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,660
up on that big screen, right?

668
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,780
- She's at the stadium. - She's here.

669
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,660
Looks like you'll be trading this cell in for another.

671
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,130
All right, Spencer's all locked up in Iron Heights.

672
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,810
- The Mayor's resigning. - What?

673
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,920
I'm surprised she lasted this long.

674
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,400
Luckily, I was able to get a quote from her

675
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,000
exonerating Officer Jones for my article.

676
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,690
Post will go up tomorrow.

677
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,900
Papa Joe will be relieved his friend's in the clear.

678
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,990
Yeah.

679
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,060
Well, at least now, with Spencer behind us,

680
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,190
we can concentrate on bigger fish.

681
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,410
Yes, we can.

682
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,420
- So... - Uh, Sherlock--

683
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,420
- Sherloque. - He thinks he's found a key to Cicada's identity.

684
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,730
A crucial clue to help us solve our little mystery.

685
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,970
So we all know the distinctive sound of Cicada's breathing

686
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,550
due to the respirator in the mask.

687
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,310
But not just that, because also his lungs are injured.

688
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,480
But injured from what?

689
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,650
Historically, there is an event that causes David Hersch

690
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,120
to always become Cicada, but not this time.

691
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,970
There's a different Cicada because--

692
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,310
Because Nora helped me destroy the satellite.

693
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,580
Monsieur Allen, Nora's strike through the satellite

694
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,460
changed the trajectory of the debris,

695
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,860
and now the debris has hit a new person and injured...

696
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,970
our new Cicada.

697
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,210
Okay, but how did that give him his powers?

698
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,430
DeVoe flooded the satellite with dark matter.

699
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:22,050
It makes sense that the pieces would be saturated.

700
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:25,540
So Cicada and the dagger were created

701
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,220
the night of the Enlightenment.

702
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,050
Acquired powers together.

703
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,500
Well, listen, Sherloke--

704
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,990
- Sherloque. - I got to hand it to you.

705
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,010
That's very impressive.

706
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,930
It's quite a breakthrough, right, Monsieur Dibny?

707
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,920
One that I cannot take any credit for.

708
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,080
No, all the credit, all the praise

709
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,330
goes to you, Monsieur Dibny.

710
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,390
It was your instincts to follow the mask, right?

711
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,520
Well, you were right, and I was...

712
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,720
less right.

713
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,860
I apologize.

714
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,940
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.

715
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,680
The dagger part still doesn't make sense.

716
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,130
I mean, things cannot become metas, right?

717
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,130
I don't know about that.

718
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,930
Our satellite didn't just create new metas.

719
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,190
It created meta-tech.

720
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,850
Which puts meta-human abilities in the hands of...

721
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,500
anyone.

722
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,090
Caitlin says you're going to be fine.

723
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,760
I'm sorry for suppressing your powers, but...

724
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,390
I think it was the right thing to do.

725
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,090
Yeah. No, I-I...

726
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,950
I get it. I mean, I was trying to kill Dad.

727
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,930
I would've done the same thing, too.

728
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,360
No, that's...

729
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,410
That's not what I mean.

730
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,440
I'm talking about in the future.

731
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,820
What?

732
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,080
I know that you're upset and angry.

733
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,120
And honestly, I...

734
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,850
Before today, I couldn't even imagine a situation

735
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,080
where I would do something like that to you.

736
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,840
But after seeing the choice that I just made...

737
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,680
I know that whatever reason I would have

738
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,990
for keeping your powers a secret, it...

739
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,730
it must have been a good one, Nora.

740
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,200
It must have been to protect you.

741
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,500
No.

742
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,630
What happened today...

743
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,580
has nothing to do with what happens in the future.

744
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,900
You didn't suppress my abilities my whole life

745
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,840
because I was brainwashed or attacking people.

746
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,190
You did it to control me.

747
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,820
My whole life I felt like I was different

748
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,600
than everybody else, but I didn't know why.

749
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:27,160
You took a choice away from me

750
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,960
that I didn't even know that I had...

751
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,090
A choice to be a hero, like my dad.

752
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,360
What's going on?

753
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,410
- Nothing, we're just talking. - No.

754
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,660
Mom thinks that she had good reason to suppress my powers

755
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:54,340
in the future, but she doesn't know what that reason is.

756
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,160
I'm sure it's a good one.

757
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:06,950
Look, Nora, I don't have to visit the future

758
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:09,230
to know what kind of mother Iris's gonna be.

759
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:13,070
She cares about family more than anyone I've ever met.

760
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,780
Okay? And...

761
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,120
I support her decisions...

762
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,590
past, present, and future.

763
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,720
Then I guess I need to rethink what the meaning of family is.

764
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,910
Nora, wait.

765
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,430
Do you know what hurt the most about learning I had powers?

766
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,840
Not hearing it from my mom.

767
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,840
It's all right.

768
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,980
- Hi. - Nora, hi.

769
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,990
Um, it's kind of a long story,

770
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,880
but can I stay here?

771
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,920
Get in here, kid.

772
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,830
Are you sure it's not too much trouble?

773
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:21,820
It's fine. Maybe talk about the reason later?

774
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:26,280
But for now, there's some fresh pillows and blankets upstairs.

775
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,830
Thanks, Papa Joe.
