1
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:13,013
You think there's a kid
in Kenny's crew

2
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,231
that's over the age of 17?

3
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,364
More like 15.

4
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:18,670
Yo, we got eyes

5
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:20,933
on our boys on the block,
if y'all are ready.

6
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:23,023
Copy. Shutting down now.

7
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,418
- This one mine.
- What's up, Malik?

8
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:28,854
What's up, girl? Looking fine,

9
00:00:28,898 --> 00:00:30,117
as usual.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,224
You know she's with me, right?

11
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,076
Yeah, for now, son. For now.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,251
All right, all right.

13
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:35,533
All right, so what you all need?

14
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:36,688
The usual?

15
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:37,883
Actually, we need
a little extra today.

16
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,102
We have friends up in Lakeview

17
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:40,146
that had a taste
of the good stuff,

18
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,650
want a little more.

19
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:47,177
How much extra weight
we talking?

20
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,570
100 grams.

21
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:50,287
I don't usually carry
that much product on me,

22
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,158
so I'ma need to do
a little wheelin' and dealin'.

23
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:54,184
We talking straight packed
or powder?

24
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,229
Packed up for sure.

25
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:56,795
Okay, I can make that happen.

26
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,101
Meet me at Division Street,

27
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,364
One Stop parking lot,
at 400 p.m.

28
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:02,018
- All right.
- We can make that happen.

29
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,238
And look, feel free
to come solo, baby.

30
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,630
Hey, I heard that.

31
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:07,043
Yeah, it was meant
for you to hear.

32
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,155
Watch yourself.

33
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:10,722
We'll see you later.

34
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,724
All right, kid took the bait.

35
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:18,774
Downside to using child labor

36
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,732
Inexperienced.

37
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:28,610
It's 500.

38
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,002
For a dealer, being an hour late

39
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,092
is actually considered early.

40
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,745
You guys got anything?

41
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,270
Nothing so far.

42
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:38,489
Should've had Upton
do the deal alone.

43
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:39,925
Kid's got eyes for her.

44
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:42,948
Units in 21,
we're getting multiple calls

45
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:45,975
of shots fired
at 3852 South on Wells.

46
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,107
Jay, did you hear that?

47
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,499
We just got a call
over the zone.

48
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:51,023
Shots fired two blocks away.
We're gonna take it.

49
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,162
This is the site here.

50
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:06,387
How we look, Ruz?

51
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,911
We're good. We're good.

52
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:18,268
Body.

53
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,143
Hold on. Call it in!

54
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,014
5021 Ida. Roll an ambulance.

55
00:02:25,057 --> 00:02:27,016
Hang on, bro. Okay?

56
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:28,844
Hang on. Help is coming.

57
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:31,803
Malik. Malik!

58
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:37,418
Malik!

59
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:45,904
Ain't got a pulse. He's gone.

60
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,870
Just a dumb kid, man.

61
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,833
Kid took two to the chest.

62
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:04,532
Found two nine-millimeter
rounds right next to the body.

63
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:06,055
Signs of a struggle?

64
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,685
No, just took two and dropped
right where he stood.

65
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:10,015
- Weapon?
- Nothing recovered so far.

66
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,906
Been doing surveillance
on this block for weeks.

67
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,194
This is a known re-up spot
for Kenny's corner boys.

68
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:15,934
DOA was actually a kid
we were supposed

69
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,414
to meet up with tonight.

70
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,957
All right, so the kid
asks for more weight.

71
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,896
Kenny gets spooked that
he might be snitching,

72
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,158
so he shoots him.

73
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,396
We have two witnesses
that saw a boy

74
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,789
running away from
the construction site

75
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,094
moments after the shots
were fired.

76
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,270
And the physical description

77
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:28,358
matches Nathan,
Malik's sidekick.

78
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:29,818
Well, maybe he's the shooter.

79
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,820
Or he's a friend
that saw the shooter

80
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,038
and he ran like hell.

81
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,277
Well, either way,
he's our only lead,

82
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,737
so let's find him fast.

83
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:41,133
Nathan Hawkins, 15 years old.

84
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,526
Dropped out of school a year ago

85
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,267
to start slinging dope
for Kenny Armstrong.

86
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,723
Yeah, he has one arrest
on his record.

87
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,246
It's for a delivery charge
three months ago.

88
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,924
Any idea where he might
be hanging out?

89
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,076
His last known address was
his mom's apartment in Austin.

90
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,668
But she OD'd a year ago around
the time he started dealing.

91
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,886
Okay, father?

92
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,540
Been behind bars
for the last decade.

93
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:58,083
Who bailed him out
when he got busted?

94
00:03:58,107 --> 00:03:59,456
That would be Sarah Washington,

95
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,197
- Nathan's aunt.
- All right,

96
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,807
so find an address.
Check it out.

97
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:14,645
Hey, Dr. Appelbaum.

98
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,275
Thanks for getting back to me
so quickly.

99
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,694
Look, I was hoping
you could call me in a refill.

100
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,566
I ran out, and my shoulder's
still killing me.

101
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,090
What?

102
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:26,266
Eight days?

103
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:27,658
No, no, no, no, no.

104
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,660
That's not gonna work.
I need more tonight.

105
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,101
How you doing, ma'am?
I'm Officer Atwater.

106
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:37,494
This is Officer Ruzek.

107
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,322
Are you Sarah Washington?

108
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,584
What y'all boys need?

109
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,282
We're looking for your nephew,

110
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,022
Nathan Hawkins.
Does he live here?

111
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,763
He does, but he's not home.

112
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,896
When was the last time
you saw him?

113
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:49,550
This morning.

114
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:52,117
Okay, would you mind if we
took a look around his room?

115
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:56,861
Y'all got five minutes.

116
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,036
Yes, ma'am.

117
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,473
Down the hall.

118
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,475
In the back.

119
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,311
Man, dude.

120
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:13,574
Look at this place.

121
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,792
No wonder kids like Nathan

122
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,012
end up working for guys
like Kenny.

123
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:19,667
Mom's dead, dad locked up.

124
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,146
Working those corners
is probably

125
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,323
the most stable thing
in that boy's life.

126
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:28,066
There's a POD camera
across the street.

127
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,982
Maybe something from that, yeah?

128
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,379
Okay, there's Nathan.

129
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,381
All right, so that's
time-stamped 545,

130
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,078
45 minutes after
Malik was killed.

131
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:42,385
- Let's keep going.
- Okay.

132
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:46,084
Freeze right there.

133
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:47,671
There's Nathan right there.
Passenger side window.

134
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,045
Yeah. Who's she?

135
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:52,003
Where's she going?

136
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:55,442
Okay, bro, let's see if we can
get facial rec on the driver.

137
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,671
- Check around back?
- Yeah.

138
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,547
Back the hell up now!

139
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,896
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey!

140
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,506
What are you doing?
Yo, we're CPD.

141
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,203
- We're CPD.
- Put that gun down.

142
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:19,466
Let me see your badge.

143
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:20,815
Okay, I'll show you the badge,

144
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,338
but I need you to put
that gun down.

145
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,576
I will when you show me
your badge.

146
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,602
There it is right there.
You see that?

147
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:27,038
We are cops, okay?

148
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:29,432
Put the gun down.

149
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,497
Now, you leave that gun inside.

150
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,044
You meet us out front.

151
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,219
All right? Right now.

152
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,743
Yeah.

153
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,355
Get your hands
out of your pockets

154
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,878
and come here.

155
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,532
Come right here.

156
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,229
Keep 'em up.

157
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:48,059
What the hell is wrong with you?

158
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,063
Pull a gun on the cops?

159
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:53,650
Well, how the hell
was I supposed to know?

160
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:55,086
It's not like you sent
a résumé ahead of time.

161
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,155
All I saw was two dudes
walking up on my house.

162
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,374
Is this necessary?

163
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,202
Yeah, you just
pulled a gun on us.

164
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:01,812
All right?

165
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:03,945
Is it registered?

166
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:05,903
It sure is, and I can
show you the permit.

167
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:09,733
Okay. Do you know anybody
by the name of Nathan Hawkins?

168
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:10,821
Yeah.

169
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,780
When was the last time
you saw him?

170
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,304
I don't know.
Two, three weeks ago.

171
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:16,653
Wrong answer.

172
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:17,935
Next wrong answer,
we're gonna bring you in,

173
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,458
and we're gonna start
writing up paper.

174
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,614
Last chance, Laila.

175
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,486
Why the hell
do you know my name?

176
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,749
Because you are a suspect
in a murder investigation.

177
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:26,968
That's why we know your name.

178
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,578
What the hell are you
talking about?

179
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,077
We're talking about
how we have a video

180
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,644
of you and Nathan Hawkins
riding in your car...

181
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:34,018
This carthis afternoon.

182
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:36,760
No, I think you got
the wrong person.

183
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,501
I think we should bring her in.

184
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,024
Why? What'd I do?

185
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:41,199
What'd you do?

186
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:42,568
You helped your friend
Kenny Armstrong

187
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:43,680
kill Nathan Hawkins.

188
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,769
You think I'd kill Nathan?

189
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,510
Then prove us wrong, Laila.
Where is he?

190
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:50,165
He's right here.

191
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,471
- Nathan.
- You guys got it

192
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:52,863
all wrong, all right?

193
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,561
Laila's not trying
to kill me, all right?

194
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:55,605
She's trying to help me.

195
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:06,181
Man, I ain't saying nothing
to y'all.

196
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,399
Not gonna say anything?

197
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:08,923
Come on, man, what happened?

198
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,335
You and Malik,
you get into an argument?

199
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,554
He steal from you?
He screw your girlfriend?

200
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:12,729
- What?
- Man, not even close.

201
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:15,103
Okay? Malik was my boy.

202
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:17,453
All right? We were tight.

203
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,281
I'd never hurt him, man. Never.

204
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,457
Okay, you didn't do it.

205
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,676
Who did, Nathan?

206
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,115
Don't know.

207
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:30,466
Look, we all know what's
going on here, okay?

208
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,164
We know that Malik asked Kenny
for some more weight.

209
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,794
So Kenny thought that Malik
was snitching,

210
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:35,776
so he killed him.

211
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,429
He thinks you are too.

212
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,736
Right? Thinks you're snitching?

213
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,782
But I'm not.

214
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,348
Malik wouldn't either.

215
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:44,761
Doesn't matter,
if Kenny thinks you are.

216
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:46,787
Kenny thinks you are,
he's gonna kill you too.

217
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:52,140
Look, Nathan.

218
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,576
Look at me for a second.

219
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,274
That's why you went
to Laila's, right?

220
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:57,556
That's why you went to Laila's.

221
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,190
You were looking
for a place to hide out.

222
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:01,105
Look, bro, we just need
your help.

223
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:02,803
Okay, we don't care
that you sell drugs.

224
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,805
We don't care, bro. Not at all.

225
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,937
We just need to know if you saw
who did the murder.

226
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,243
- That's all.
- I didn't.

227
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:09,606
- Don't lie to me.
- Man, I'm not.

228
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,422
Did Nathan see who shot Malik?

229
00:09:13,465 --> 00:09:15,511
No, but he knows it was Kenny.

230
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,166
Hell, my five-year-old niece
knows it's Kenny.

231
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,646
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

232
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,667
You run with Kenny Armstrong,
but at the same time,

233
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,519
you protect kids
from getting shot by him?

234
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,262
I don't run with Kenny
or anybody else.

235
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:29,177
Now, we used to be a thing,

236
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,528
but I've been out the game
for nine years.

237
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,288
I haven't gotten as much
as a parking ticket.

238
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:35,792
So don't lump me up with Kenny

239
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:39,100
or any other punk-ass
gangbanger I grew up with.

240
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,276
Why the change?

241
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,757
I grew up. That's why.

242
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,240
We all make mistakes
when we're young.

243
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,287
Even you, Detective.

244
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,075
She's a tough chick.

245
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,381
Yeah. Smart too.

246
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:01,078
Nathan's lucky to have her
in his life.

247
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:02,776
Yeah, we'll see about that.

248
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,039
Come on, Kev. You and me.

249
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,997
- You and me what?
- Come on.

250
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,525
All right, Ms. Davis.
You're free to go.

251
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:16,224
Okay, good.
Now, what about Nathan?

252
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:18,443
Can I take him home too?

253
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,663
We're charging him
with heroin distribution.

254
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,317
What? Heroin distribution

255
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,232
for slinging dime bags
on the corner?

256
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:27,148
Well, if he agrees to
cooperate in the murder case,

257
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:28,802
we might be able
to cut him a break.

258
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,281
But he didn't see anything.

259
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,197
Well, that doesn't mean
he can't wear a wire.

260
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,764
That boy has a target
on his back

261
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:36,592
the size of Soldier Field
and you want him

262
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,246
to wear a wire?

263
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,553
Kenny will kill his ass
in ten seconds flat.

264
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,947
Well, God doesn't give
with both hands.

265
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:45,470
Nathan is a good boy.

266
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,604
He is a scared-ass little kid
with no place to go,

267
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,345
and it is your job to help him.

268
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:53,478
Listen, it's my job to arrest.

269
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,176
Malik's killer, Kenny Armstrong,

270
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:56,830
your ex-boyfriend.

271
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,963
Right now, Nathan is my
best shot at doing that.

272
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:01,312
Introduce me to Kenny.

273
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:04,576
Right?

274
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,858
We know his crew
meets at his crib.

275
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,405
Find a way to get me in there.

276
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,234
So I can plant the wire.

277
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,897
Okay, then you gotta promise me
that you're gonna get Nathan

278
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,247
out of Chicago fast.

279
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,163
Deal.

280
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,737
I got you, man.

281
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,521
All right.

282
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,828
You ain't gonna be here
too long.

283
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:40,371
Long as it takes for us
to find somebody

284
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:42,179
to take you in.

285
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,053
You got anybody we can
reach out to outside the state?

286
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:47,707
Anywhere you wanna go?

287
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,319
No, I'm not interested
in leaving.

288
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,278
Hey, come on, man. I dig it.

289
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,065
Listen, man, I get it.

290
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,937
Moving is rough, but you might
actually like a new city.

291
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,897
My little brother
had to relocate to Texas.

292
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,073
He wasn't feeling it at first.

293
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,509
Digs it now.

294
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,731
My cousin.

295
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,343
He's older. He lives in Atlanta.

296
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:16,561
I ain't seen him in a while,

297
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:17,998
but he's always been nice to me.

298
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,347
Okay.

299
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,479
Track cuz down.

300
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,351
- All right.
- Thanks.

301
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:27,181
Yo, you leavin'?

302
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:30,053
Yeah, man, I gotta get
to a birthday party.

303
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,402
But you're all set.

304
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:34,014
We got a police officer
at the door.

305
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:36,190
They got you.

306
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,844
You're good.

307
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,116
How you feel?

308
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,031
- I'm cool.
- Cool? Good.

309
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,380
So what's this, a first date?

310
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:53,685
First date?

311
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,600
To a 60-year-old's
birthday party?

312
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,385
No, I don't think so.

313
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:00,127
Okay, a few months, then.

314
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,998
Make it look real, right?

315
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,536
- Surprise.
- Surprise.

316
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,412
Laila, good to see you, baby.

317
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:27,241
So glad you're here
to help me celebrate.

318
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,330
Look at you, girl.

319
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,071
Damn, just as beautiful as ever.

320
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:32,550
Hey, Kenny.

321
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,422
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

322
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,095
You know Mama always
liked you more than me.

323
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,904
Yeah. Hey, y'all.

324
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:39,601
This is my friend Keith.

325
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,826
Hey, what's good, man?

326
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,305
Nothing much.

327
00:13:48,349 --> 00:13:51,613
Make sure y'all go and get
some of that pork, you know?

328
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:53,354
I brought it in from St. Louis.

329
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:55,573
I actually like
how that cobbler looks.

330
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:56,897
Best peach cobbler in the city.

331
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:58,141
You kidding.

332
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,795
Better get inside
before it's all gone.

333
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,623
Okay, I can do that.
You need anything?

334
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,059
All right.

335
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:04,800
Happy birthday, Mama.
Thank you, baby.

336
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,059
How's it going in there?

337
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,844
Pretty good.
Found Kenny's man cave.

338
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890
Seems like a good place
to do some talking.

339
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:56,721
Okay.

340
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,250
Wait. I'll be right back.

341
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:04,860
- Cool.
- All right.

342
00:15:07,036 --> 00:15:09,038
Hey.

343
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,606
It's been a while, Laila.

344
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,304
Thought you were trying
to avoid me.

345
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:15,653
Just been busy,

346
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,699
you know, down at the center.

347
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,614
Yeah, I heard about that.

348
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:21,355
Yeah, you working
with the kids, right?

349
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,880
You know, I got a lot
of respect for that.

350
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,449
How 'bout I make a donation
to the cause, you know?

351
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,365
No. No, I'm cool.

352
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:33,715
No offense.

353
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,152
I just wanna keep
this thing legit.

354
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:37,371
Yeah, the choice is yours.

355
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,851
But thanks for offering.

356
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,984
- Hey, yo, Marlo.
- Yo.

357
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:45,596
Yo, keep these fools
out of my basement.

358
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,902
Yeah, all right.

359
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,425
Mama, I'm gonna grab a drink.

360
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:49,644
Can I get you something?

361
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:51,385
- I'm good, sweetie.
- Okay.

362
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:01,003
Okay, let me know
when you got a visual.

363
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,744
We've got eyes.

364
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,583
Who the hell are you?

365
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:17,802
Hey...

366
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,369
let's not get worked up, okay?

367
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,023
What you doing down here?

368
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,590
- I got lost.
- You got lost?

369
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:23,873
Let me get back to the party.

370
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,211
All right. Come on, fellas.

371
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,623
There's no need to play
with guns, okay?

372
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,214
I said, what you doing
down here?

373
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:39,626
I told you, I was looking
around and I got lost, okay?

374
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:44,220
Nah, bro.
You see, I just met you.

375
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,659
And the way I see things, man,
that just don't feel right.

376
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:51,073
- We gotta get in there now.
- Okay, wait. Give him a sec.

377
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,533
He still hasn't used
the safe word.

378
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,274
I understand that, Kenny. Okay?

379
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:55,816
I should have asked
your permission first.

380
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,973
I didn't mean
no disrespect, man.

381
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,889
Yeah, you should've.

382
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:04,371
So I'ma ask you one more time.

383
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:05,676
Why you down here, Keith?

384
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:11,856
Laila told me about
your '96 ball, man.

385
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,598
'96 Bulls, come on, that's
my favorite team of all time.

386
00:17:14,642 --> 00:17:15,947
- I had...
- Baby, that you?

387
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,601
- Yeah.
- Where the hell you been?

388
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,429
Down here talking to Kenny.
That's all.

389
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,822
What's going on?

390
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:22,215
Why's he got a gun in his hand?

391
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,825
We're here chatting
with your new man.

392
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,281
Put the gun away
before you hurt someone.

393
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:26,958
- Hey, listen. It's okay, baby.
- Hey.

394
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,414
It was just a
misunderstanding, that's all.

395
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:29,981
I should have asked
for permission first.

396
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,181
Permission to do what?

397
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:35,010
Check out his '96 ball.

398
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,925
You left a party
to come look at that crap?

399
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,493
You crazy?

400
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,297
I knew I shouldn't have
told you about this ball.

401
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,559
Come on, let's go get...
No, no, no, no, not yet.

402
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,019
What you mean, "not yet"?

403
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,977
You ain't never
been down here before.

404
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,676
And I just got that ball
last week.

405
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,592
Which means the two of y'all
are lying about something.

406
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:55,726
How you know about this, Laila?

407
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,512
How you think?

408
00:17:58,555 --> 00:17:59,774
Your mama.

409
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:03,430
She always joking about
how stupid you are

410
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:05,736
spending all your money
on this nonsense.

411
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,349
Go ask her.

412
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,353
Come on, let's go ask her.

413
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,006
Let's go ruin her party...
No, no.

414
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,138
About this crap.

415
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:18,445
Not yet. Not yet.

416
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:20,490
Yeah.

417
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:24,015
I'm sorry.

418
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,061
It's just a big
misunderstanding, you know?

419
00:18:28,324 --> 00:18:30,631
Hey, go on. Get out of here.

420
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,763
Go enjoy the party.

421
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,688
Hey.

422
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:46,299
You're good to go.

423
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:49,693
Thank you, and appreciate you
for helping me out back there.

424
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,999
It means a lot.

425
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,435
- Sure thing.
- No, seriously.

426
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,109
If that charity thing
doesn't work out for you,

427
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,612
you should think about
a future here.

428
00:18:55,656 --> 00:18:59,181
Let's not get carried away.

429
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:02,576
Okay, I understand.
But real quick.

430
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:05,056
We were rapping with Nathan's
cousin down in Atlanta,

431
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,493
and he's got two kids.

432
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:07,905
He's a little worried
that Nathan's problems

433
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:09,452
are gonna follow him down there.

434
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:12,151
So do you know of any other
family that Nathan has

435
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,240
outside of Chicago
we can send that boy to?

436
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:16,851
Um...

437
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,723
he's got a grandma
down in New Orleans.

438
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,204
Grandma in New Orleans.
We will track her down.

439
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,964
We're gonna do everything
in our power to make sure

440
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:25,555
that Nathan gets out of here,
okay?

441
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,383
You got my word on that.

442
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,037
If you say so.

443
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,562
What?
You don'tyou don't trust me?

444
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,825
I don't trust anybody,

445
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,827
let alone a smooth-talking cop.

446
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:39,308
Well, you obviously
don't know me too well.

447
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,223
You're right. I don't.

448
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,246
So why don't you buy me a drink

449
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,630
and let me know
who you really are?

450
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,755
Okay, here we go.

451
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,368
Glass of water.
Shot of Hennessy.

452
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,718
I see you into that hard stuff?

453
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:00,938
I'm not wasting calories
on that fruity crap.

454
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,637
- Or a Heineken.
- What?

455
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,768
Straight up, you've been

456
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,117
around them white boys too long.

457
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,597
Don't do that,

458
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:09,947
Ms. West Side.

459
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,427
That is just like a cop.

460
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:13,386
Always gotta put a label
on somebody.

461
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,605
Well, obviously sometimes
those labels fit.

462
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:17,607
Sometimes they don't.

463
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,048
So tell me, Kevin.

464
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,138
How does a good-looking
brother like you

465
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:30,577
raise his hand and say,
"I wanna be a cop"...

466
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,187
And in Chicago, no less?

467
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,671
My pops got locked up early.

468
00:20:37,714 --> 00:20:39,194
And I didn't wanna go out
like that.

469
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,153
So in order to make
a difference,

470
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,068
I decided to do some good
in my community.

471
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:48,943
I like that.

472
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,268
Yeah, that's not too corny
for you?

473
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:52,163
No, that's corny as hell.

474
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,166
But it's honest.

475
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:06,656
What's that?

476
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,832
It's, aspirin.

477
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,183
These all-nighters are tough.
Yeah.

478
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,273
I'm getting a headache
staring at this monitor.

479
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,685
Guess I'm not as young
as I used to be.

480
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,885
Well, this isn't gonna help.

481
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:19,321
Decaf. All they had left.

482
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,975
Decaf at 300 a.m.?
What's the point?

483
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:22,498
I know, right?

484
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,026
Finally.

485
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,811
Hey, anybody put eyes on Nathan?

486
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:32,726
No, not yet.

487
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,337
Well, y'all put a tap
on the wire,

488
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,339
get it out to his peeps.

489
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:40,037
If anybody knows something
or anything,

490
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:42,431
you bring his ass down
to the EP, all right?

491
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,520
You get that?
What'd he say, "EP"?

492
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:45,956
- That's what I heard too.
- Yeah.

493
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,044
Let's get a warrant.

494
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:06,063
- Hey.
- Hey there.

495
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,805
Yeah, I can dig waking up
to this face.

496
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,852
Well, look, Kevin.

497
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,725
I had fun and all, but...

498
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:17,379
But what?

499
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:25,648
I'm just playing.

500
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,782
You play too damn rough for me.

501
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:32,263
Well, so do you.

502
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:05,296
I gotta go.

503
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,950
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:06,994 --> 00:23:08,604
I gotta go.

505
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,739
It's okay.

506
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:14,305
Sort of.

507
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:17,831
Listen, let's rain check
round two.

508
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:22,444
See? Yeah, you have been
with those white boys too long.

509
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:23,880
Well, I could come to your place

510
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:25,969
a little bit later,
finish what we started.

511
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,409
That's better.

512
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:32,149
And the answer is yes.

513
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,783
Chicago PD!

514
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,022
Listen up, we have a warrant
to search this establishment.

515
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:00,676
Hey, hands in the air.
Get 'em where I can see you.

516
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,093
Get 'em up.
Warrant? Based on what?

517
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,791
Based on we have a warrant.

518
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,053
Now, everyone get up.

519
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,750
Move with your hands up
against that wall.

520
00:24:07,794 --> 00:24:10,057
- Come on, now.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

521
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,188
Come on.

522
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,659
Well, well, well, well,
well, well, well, well.

523
00:24:51,054 --> 00:24:52,882
27 firearms, Kenny?

524
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,841
We had to put a rush order
in to ballistics

525
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:56,146
to go through 'em.

526
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,539
If it's too much trouble...

527
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,759
Your boys can give them back
to the streets.

528
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,675
Yeah, I'm guessing
there's a good chance

529
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:06,287
one of them nines is gonna
come back with a body on it...

530
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,636
maybe even Malik's.

531
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,769
Don't know anybody named Malik.

532
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:10,944
Yeah, you do.

533
00:25:10,987 --> 00:25:12,269
That's the kid you shot
for snitching.

534
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:13,250
Doesn't ring a bell.

535
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:14,643
I'm sorry.

536
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:17,907
And like I said...
those guns are not mine.

537
00:25:17,951 --> 00:25:19,561
Then how did they
wind up in your bar?

538
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:20,997
Not my bar, neither.

539
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:23,130
You know...

540
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:26,176
if you guys are gonna trump up
some fake-ass charges,

541
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,004
go ahead.

542
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:29,310
Or can I go now?

543
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:31,617
You're free to go.

544
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,533
Just don't go too far.

545
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,711
- Yo, Maury.
- What?

546
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:39,992
Tell me you got something good.

547
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,452
I do.

548
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,952
- On the nines, right?
- No, those are clean,

549
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:45,674
all of them, but I found
a print on a Beretta 32

550
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:48,851
that was used in a cold-case
homicide ten years ago.

551
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:52,072
The handle was wiped clean,
but the magazine wasn't.

552
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:56,772
I got two partial matches and
then one solid 12-point match.

553
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:58,774
12 points, nice. You get a hit?

554
00:25:58,818 --> 00:25:59,949
Yeah.

555
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,474
She's pretty for a killer?

556
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,489
You're late.

557
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,491
It's almost 1000.
Didn't think you were coming.

558
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,715
Did something happen?

559
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,282
Is it Nathan? Is he okay?

560
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,284
Nathan's fine.

561
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:32,199
We're still trying to track down

562
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:34,636
his grandma in New Orleans.

563
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,465
All right, then what's up?

564
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:39,380
You seem preoccupied.

565
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:44,254
We found a bag of guns
in Kenny's bar.

566
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:48,171
One of those guns
was used to kill

567
00:26:48,215 --> 00:26:50,521
a convenience store clerk
ten years ago.

568
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:55,091
- Your prints are on it.
- I...

569
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,268
I can explain.

570
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:00,662
Listen...

571
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,273
I'm a cop.

572
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:05,232
You talk to me, that's evidence.

573
00:27:06,189 --> 00:27:08,888
Well, I didn't shoot nobody.

574
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,498
Okay? I swear to God.

575
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:14,676
Cop or not cop, I'm gonna
tell you what happened,

576
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,853
and you can do what you want.

577
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,817
I was in the car with Kenny.

578
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,297
We were just hanging out,
chilling.

579
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:30,823
And then he just pulls over
in front of a convenience store

580
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:33,260
and says that a guy who works
inside owes him some money.

581
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,915
So he hops out and then
he runs into the store.

582
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:38,265
Two minutes later,

583
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,876
I hear "pop, pop," and then
he hops back in the car,

584
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,138
and we drive off.

585
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:43,531
I was in the car the whole time.

586
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,074
I never even stepped foot
in that store.

587
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,752
How did your prints
get on the magazine?

588
00:27:46,795 --> 00:27:48,797
'Cause Kenny told me
to load the damn thing,

589
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,016
so I did it.

590
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,626
I didn't even think about it.

591
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,847
Look, it sounds stupid, okay?
I know.

592
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,371
But I was 17.

593
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,373
I had no idea he was gonna
shoot that guy.

594
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,896
Doesn't matter what you think.

595
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,160
You were there.

596
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:06,946
You were a part of a crime
that resulted in a man's death.

597
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:09,470
Thinking or not, naive or not,

598
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:10,732
that's felony murder.

599
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:18,914
I've had a smile on my face
all day

600
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,413
'cause I knew you were
coming here tonight,

601
00:28:20,437 --> 00:28:22,962
and we're sitting here
talking about murder

602
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,311
and fingerprints and Kenny.

603
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:25,878
- It's just like...
- Laila...

604
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,270
I'm in a bad dream or something.

605
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:28,532
Laila, this is the last thing

606
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,491
that I want to be
talking about, okay?

607
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:31,840
Trust me.

608
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,756
But I don't have a choice.

609
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:38,891
So now what?

610
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:44,592
Are you going to arrest me?

611
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:45,898
Come on.

612
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,208
- So it's like that?
- Like what?

613
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:53,688
Like as soon as things
get tough,

614
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,950
you hide behind your badge?

615
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:57,126
Don't do that.
Don't put this on me.

616
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,345
I didn't ask for this.

617
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,173
But it came your way,
nonetheless.

618
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:02,216
So the question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

619
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,619
I'm not perfect. I'm not.

620
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:14,665
Okay? I made mistakes.

621
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,580
I know that.

622
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:19,932
But for the past nine years,
I have been a good person.

623
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,411
A very good person.

624
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:25,154
I've been at
the community center every day,

625
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:29,115
helping our young people
make good decisions.

626
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:34,424
The way that I see it... okay,

627
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:36,383
me being out here
is a good thing.

628
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:40,604
I'm keeping young brothers
from selling drugs

629
00:29:40,648 --> 00:29:44,870
and joining gangs
and robbing people.

630
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,915
I'm saving lives.

631
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:53,139
So why arrest me for something
that I did stupid

632
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,662
when I was a kid?

633
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:03,932
She was dating Kenny.

634
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,239
Doing what he told her to do.

635
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:07,718
She stayed right there
in the car.

636
00:30:07,762 --> 00:30:09,764
Said she had no clue
he was gonna pop that dude.

637
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,594
We got nothing linking
Kenny to Malik's murder.

638
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:15,857
We gotta use the print.

639
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:18,904
Force Laila to wear a wire,
get Kenny talking about

640
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:19,905
how he killed that clerk.

641
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:21,515
Felony murder?

642
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:22,777
She'd have to do some time.

643
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,345
I know, but...

644
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:26,999
we gotta get Kenny
off the street.

645
00:30:29,044 --> 00:30:30,239
- Sarge...
- Let me say something.

646
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:32,613
The clerk who took two
in the chest,

647
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:33,744
did he get a free pass?

648
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:38,532
- That was ten years ago.
- Yeah.

649
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:42,188
Ten years of hell
for the victim's family.

650
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,233
Waking up every day
thinking about

651
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:46,018
what happened to their father.

652
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,020
Their husband. Their son.

653
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:55,897
Is there something else I need
to know about you and Laila?

654
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,382
Yeah.

655
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,123
We got together the other night.

656
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:09,737
Then you gotta walk away
from this, Kev.

657
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,000
Now.

658
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:14,176
Understand?

659
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,006
No more communication
of any kind.

660
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,757
Okay.

661
00:31:31,324 --> 00:31:35,371
Help us get Kenny to confess
to murdering that clerk,

662
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:39,245
agree to testify
to that effect in court,

663
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:40,942
and you may not do any time.

664
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,074
Are y'all crazy?

665
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,252
Kenny's not stupid.

666
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:48,776
I can't just walk up
to the man and say,

667
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:50,449
"Hey, remember the night
you murdered that clerk?"

668
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:54,347
Laila, I'm trying
to help you, okay?

669
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,740
But to do that,
you gotta help us.

670
00:31:58,438 --> 00:32:00,657
Come on, help us get Kenny
off the street

671
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:01,615
once and for all.

672
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:03,051
Y'all, this is wrong.

673
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:06,272
And Mr. Undercover too.
He knows this is wrong.

674
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:09,362
He's just too afraid
to do anything about it.

675
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,844
Where is he anyway?

676
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:18,632
Is he hiding in the bathroom
like a little punk-ass bitch?

677
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:22,114
Officer Atwater's
been assigned to another case.

678
00:32:27,336 --> 00:32:29,904
Of course he has.

679
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,994
'Cause there's nothing left
to do, right?

680
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:38,695
He got me to help.
Got me into his bed.

681
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:44,310
And then he buries me for
something I didn't even do.

682
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:55,843
I saved this punk's life,
and he does this.

683
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:59,020
For real?

684
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:04,069
I should have let Kenny know
he was a cop...

685
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:10,118
And let him kill his ass.

686
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:24,002
Got it?

687
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:28,876
Hey, can I get a minute?

688
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,965
Yeah, we got some equipment
to load.

689
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:41,932
There's really nothing
I can say,

690
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,500
other than I'm sorry.

691
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:46,024
I didn't want
for this to happen.

692
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,417
But you didn't do anything
to stop it, either.

693
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,335
It's not that easy, Laila.

694
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,076
You're right.

695
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,775
It required you
to have some courage.

696
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,041
You don't understand...

697
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:04,912
No, sure, I do.

698
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:09,960
You one of those brothers
that like to straddle the line.

699
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:11,875
You pick and choose
when to be black

700
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,442
and when to be blue.

701
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,881
What about Nathan?

702
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,274
You gonna screw him over too?

703
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:20,971
Is that your thing?
Is that what you do?

704
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,538
You screw over your own kind?

705
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,810
Yo, Nathan. Come on, man.

706
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:35,179
Found your grandma.
She can't wait to see you.

707
00:34:35,203 --> 00:34:36,683
Let's get up out of here.
Come on.

708
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:38,424
No, man. I ain't leaving.

709
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:41,644
We already talked about this.

710
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:43,820
Can't go. I need to stay here.

711
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:44,995
Help my aunt.

712
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,736
What are you talking about?

713
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,523
Kenny's people broke into
my aunt's house last night.

714
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,457
Tore it apart, wrote all kinds
of nasty things on the walls.

715
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:54,024
Okay, well, I'll send
somebody over there

716
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:55,156
to check on her,
but you gotta get

717
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,616
your ass up out of here, man.

718
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,879
Man, wherever I go,
Kenny's gonna track me down.

719
00:34:58,922 --> 00:35:01,577
Okay, so I might as well
just stay here.

720
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,144
You're a boy. All right?

721
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:04,817
That means that you can
go to another city

722
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:06,016
and start all over.

723
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,279
I can take care of myself.

724
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,237
Look, dude,
I'm not going nowhere.

725
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,805
All right? So you might as well
justjust lock me up

726
00:35:11,848 --> 00:35:13,589
or just let me go.

727
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:16,675
If that's what you want.

728
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,430
Hey, all right, look at me.

729
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:30,737
The distress word is "Voight."

730
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,565
If anything goes bad,
just say the word,

731
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:33,566
and we'll bust in.

732
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:35,176
I got it.

733
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,328
All you gotta do is get Kenny
to incriminate himself, okay?

734
00:35:37,352 --> 00:35:38,982
Just get him talking
about the robberies...

735
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,964
I said I got it.

736
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,793
Okay, you good?

737
00:35:43,837 --> 00:35:46,448
All right. Go, go, go, go, go.

738
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,205
Hey, you. Where Kenny?

739
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:06,033
Hey, girl. Don't know.

740
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:07,643
Check the back office.

741
00:36:07,687 --> 00:36:09,210
Just play it cool.

742
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:12,605
Kenny, you in there?

743
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,520
God.

744
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:16,826
Voight! Voight!

745
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,308
- Voight!
- Laila.

746
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,918
Police.
Put your hands on the bar.

747
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:23,572
Don't move.
Put your hands on the bar.

748
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,532
Laila.

749
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,231
It's all right. What happened?

750
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,972
I don't know what happened.

751
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,669
He was like that
when I walked in.

752
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,018
All right. It's okay.

753
00:36:37,499 --> 00:36:39,458
It's okay.

754
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:40,850
He's cold.

755
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,417
Come on.

756
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,205
Yo, Laila okay?

757
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,597
Yeah, she's all right.

758
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:50,271
Tech said Kenny's been dead
for three hours.

759
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,384
Bartender claims
he didn't see anything.

760
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:53,820
We know who did it?

761
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:55,406
No, but I'm guessing
there's a lot of contenders.

762
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,910
Any evidence?

763
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:58,975
Just two nine-millimeter
shell casings on the floor.

764
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,783
That's about it.
That's not our problem.

765
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:04,134
Homicide's taking the case,
so pack up any loose ends.

766
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,373
Let's get out of here.
Copy that.

767
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,572
Wait, Kev.

768
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,226
Hang on a sec.

769
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,490
What's up?

770
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,232
Excuse me?

771
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,453
You gotta be kidding me.

772
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:19,889
What? No.

773
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:23,241
Listen, there is always
something you can do about it.

774
00:37:23,284 --> 00:37:26,722
Let me tell you something,
next time you need a favor,

775
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:28,768
don't bother asking me.

776
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:32,032
Yeah. I gotta go.

777
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,391
Kevin...

778
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:44,914
it's the ASA...

779
00:38:03,498 --> 00:38:07,502
Look, with Kenny dead,
there is no trial.

780
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:13,029
The ASA is not willing
to be as...

781
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:15,554
as lenient.

782
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:18,644
What does that mean?

783
00:38:18,687 --> 00:38:20,689
It's gonna be three years.

784
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:25,825
Said that's the best
they can do.

785
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:27,479
I'm sorry.

786
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:28,828
Jenna.

787
00:39:18,704 --> 00:39:20,227
Kenny's dead.

788
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:26,189
He killed Malik for no reason.

789
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,453
And he was gonna
kill me too, so...

790
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,280
So I did what I had to do.

791
00:39:36,939 --> 00:39:39,768
Give me the gun.

792
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,878
So what,
you gonna arrest me now?
