17
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:02,450
Previously on "The Flash"...

18
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:05,090
We have a kid who defied the laws of physics

19
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,620
to hang out with her parents.

20
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,620
- Melt. - Killer Frost...

21
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,170
Is gone.

22
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,240
The only time you need your mother

23
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,230
is when you're in trouble.

24
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,190
My father's death certificate.

25
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,650
The M.E. who signed off on it,

26
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,550
he doesn't exist.

27
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,150
Now I know why she never wants to leave

29
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,810
her dad's side and never wants to be by mine.

30
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,900
I just lost my speed.

31
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,550
Sounds like an insect.

32
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,990
Like a cicada.

33
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,130
Who's Cicada?

35
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,480
As a kid

36
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,590
there was a part of the Flash Museum

37
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,520
that always scared me.

38
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,090
I guess it's normal for children

39
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,100
to be afraid of monsters.

40
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,570
But this monster was different.

41
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,970
No one knows where he came from,

42
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,750
how he got his powers,

43
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,150
who he is.

44
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,910
All that's known is his alias,

45
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,490
and the last sound his victim's hear.

46
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,830
But that's not what makes him scary.

47
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,700
What makes him scary is...

48
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,860
you never catch him.

51
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,310
We never catch him?

52
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,130
Supergirl, The Legends,

53
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,550
even The League tried, but no one was successful.

54
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,490
Probably 'cause he can dampen everybody's powers

55
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,600
with that magic friggin' dagger.

56
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,260
Not all superheroes are meta-humans though.

57
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,710
- What about-- - Green Arrow?

58
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,280
Yeah, he tried too once, but...

59
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,040
So we're dealing with a meta-human Jack the Ripper.

60
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,460
Amazing.

61
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,240
What else do you know about him?

62
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,550
Just that he...

63
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,740
he's early.

64
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,930
What do you mean he's early?

65
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,360
In my history, Cicada's first victim

66
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,610
was a meta-human named Floyd Belkin.

67
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,660
And he never killed Gridlock or Block.

68
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,240
They're completely different victims.

69
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,630
Because the timeline changed.

70
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,460
Yeah, and now they're both dead...

71
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,460
because of me.

72
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,970
Okay, there's no telling

73
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,650
the ripple effect of this change

74
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,560
or what kind of future Nora's gonna return to.

75
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,930
We gotta catch this guy fast.

76
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,140
You mean catch the guy that future us can't catch?

77
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,700
Right, I thought beating The Thinker was hard.

78
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,060
Guys, it's Joe. CCPD needs help downtown.

79
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,670
- Okay, I got it. - No, I'll--I'll do it.

80
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,110
- Are you sure? - Yeah, I got it.

81
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,050
You guys stay here and deal with

82
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,540
the meta serial killer.

83
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,210
Okay, guys, look, we got this.

84
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,580
Let's just canvass some crime scenes,

85
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,420
interview some witnesses, and see if there's any

86
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,250
common acquaintances between Gridlock and Block.

87
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,290
I have a plan.

88
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,700
You--you've got a plan already?

89
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,810
I know how to fix this.

90
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,600
Now nobody try nothing funny.

91
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,630
This baby is solar with a zero carbon footprint.

92
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,220
I spent a week in the sun charging

93
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,930
with U, V, A, B, and C!

94
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,770
So y'all stay put.

95
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,230
I told you, I brought my own bags.

96
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,970
- Sorry. - Apology accepted.

97
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,050
Don't forget the other kind of greens.

98
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,370
What the hell?

99
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,970
Fear not, good citizens.

100
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,270
Elongated man is here.

101
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,750
Why do I feel like you're focusing

102
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,170
on the wrong thing?

103
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,370
I just saved you--

104
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,530
okay, if you're gonna--

105
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,350
just don't post--don't post--

106
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,500
I saw you post it.

107
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,560
So your plan is to contact Herr Wells?

108
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,960
Yes, that's my plan.

109
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,700
I know in the future you guys never bring in a Wells

110
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,840
to help you catch Cicada.

111
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,420
So if you want a different result this time...

112
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,790
I try something new.

113
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,580
It's a great idea.

114
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,110
- 'Cept it's not. - What?

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,660
It's a terrible idea. If you're looking for cooperation,

116
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,500
trust me, this is not your guy.

117
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,210
He is just an asshat.

118
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,560
That's way harsh, Cisco.

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,590
- I'm sorry, I'm being harsh? - Yes.

120
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,980
Go ahead, call him.

121
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,120
See if you don't get a steaming pile of side-eye.

122
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,200
Okay.

123
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,710
The Flash.

124
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,540
Wait for it,

125
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,940
- I love The Flash. - What?

126
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,680
Oh, you Barry Allen, yah? With the zoom, zoom,

127
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,860
and defy the physics laws and gravity.

128
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,750
Always with some style and grace, yah.

129
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,020
Thanks, man.

130
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,320
Das Kinder Flash. Child of the Flash.

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,960
Obviously, you have your father's moral fiber, yah.

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,660
And your mother's smarts, and classic beauty.

133
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,640
- Oh, my God. Stop. - Thank you, Herr Wells.

134
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,910
No, don't thank him.

135
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,520
Don't fall for this ruse.

136
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,860
Clearly this guy is putting on an act.

137
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,250
He's a charlatan.

138
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,710
But you hurt me, stab me in the back,

139
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,500
this guy who must be Cisco.

140
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,710
- You know who I am. - Hey, don't be rude.

141
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,040
All right, look. Hey, I'm sorry.

142
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,300
We need your help catching a meta-human serial killer.

143
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,950
Yeah, I have heard of this Cicada.

144
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,490
Of course, the message already from Kinder Flash.

145
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,660
Unfortunately, I'm otherwise occupied,

146
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,450
unable to assist you at this time.

147
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,670
- You can't? - Nein.

148
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,040
But, I have done one better

149
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,690
and called someone who can.

150
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,070
This man is a legend,

151
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,360
this man is the greatest detective in all the Multiverse.

152
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,020
So I've attached his coordinates

153
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,420
- if you want to look at them. - Okay.

154
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,560
- Yah, do you see it? - Got 'em.

155
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,250
- Good. - Cisco.

156
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,370
Cisco what? You want me to breach him here?

157
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,800
- Yeah. - Hello? I just got Benihana'd.

158
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,900
- Hurts a little bit. - Sorry.

159
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,280
Why don't we just breach him here the old fashioned way?

160
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,590
Hey, man, thank you for this. This is great.

161
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,860
Privilege and an honor to help The Flash, yah,

162
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,820
and Kinder Flash, and Iris Flash, yah.

163
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,190
Bye, Kinder Flash.

164
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,640
Bye, Herr Wells.

165
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,520
Nice guy.

166
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,450
What are you talking about, man?

167
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,080
- He's awesome. - He's not--

168
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,560
You know what?

169
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,490
Let's just turn on the extrapolator

170
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,960
and get this master detective out here.

171
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,040
Well...

172
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,810
I imagine your Earth would be colder.

173
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,960
Harrison Sherloque Wells

174
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,490
at your service.

175
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,070
I'm here to catch your killer.

177
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,440
- Barry, what is he doing? - I don't know.

178
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,200
- Maybe it's some kind of CSI kit? - Voila.

179
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,450
Shh. Just let him...

180
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,930
That's the stuff.

181
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,480
And now we can begin.

182
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,860
- Tea? - That's right.

183
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,610
We've been watching you for 20 minutes.

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,080
You're welcome.

185
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,020
- Cannot rush excellence. - This is a waste of time.

188
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,810
I'm sure you would like it if I took my leave, right?

189
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,270
Could have more time to recover from your recent heartbreak.

190
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,770
What are you talking about?

191
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,550
Subcutaneous under-eye bruising,

192
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,810
which indicates you've been crying.

193
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,040
Flaky skin, which indicates dehydration,

194
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,480
probably from alcohol consumption.

195
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,390
Alcohol plus crying can only mean one thing.

196
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,360
You have been dumped.

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,390
Wrong, detective.

198
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,710
- I have not been dumped. - Oh, no?

199
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,730
It was a mutual decision, okay?

200
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,050
Cynthia and I, we reached a decision together as a team.

201
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,280
Sure. Of course.

202
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,730
Okay, and I haven't been sobbing.

203
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,530
In fact, I can't remember the last time I cried about it.

204
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:05,800
Excuse me.

205
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,800
You are the resident speedster, I presume?

206
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,850
- How did you-- - Who favors stopping on his right heel?

207
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,510
Can tell from the wear and tear on your footwear.

208
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,330
It's uneven.

209
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,530
A trait that you have inherited from your father.

210
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,420
Although you do share

211
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,120
a little bit more body language with your mother,

212
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,210
who's been touching her left shoulder

213
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,320
since I came around here.

214
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,060
- What are you hiding from me? - Excuse me?

215
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,700
I am not hiding anything.

216
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,130
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, you are, but what?

217
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,330
You have touched it, like...

218
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,750
it's something there, then gone again,

219
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,970
something removed. A tattoo, right?

220
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,360
Yes, perhaps from a former lover?

221
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,720
Okay! You know what?

222
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,400
I think that this Sherloque has proven himself

223
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,550
and that we should start finding Cicada.

224
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,030
Excellent. Let's find Cicada.

225
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,770
But first, the question of my fee.

226
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,070
You're charging us?

227
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,810
This service is not free, right?

228
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,350
I don't work for charity.

229
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,800
Can already tell the young doctor here

230
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,350
is expecting to hire me for another case.

231
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,630
I saw you glance at your purse,

232
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,370
and I'm happy to assist you in that mystery.

233
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,220
But first, I think we can all agree

234
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,490
that a villain of Cicada's caliber...

235
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,560
will require a substantial fee.

236
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,430
Yeah.

237
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,060
Shrap, that's a lot of money even from when I from.

238
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,080
I'm very expensive, but very worth it.

239
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,350
What do you think?

240
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,590
I mean, we could sell off some of Star Labs stock.

241
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,440
- Yes! We have an agreement. - Yeah.

242
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,800
Do you hear that?

243
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,410
Sounds of these frantic steps, we're being approached

244
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,070
either by a tall, sensitive man, or...

245
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
a frightened, baby giraffe.

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,950
I got-- I got a problem here, guys, and I--

247
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,380
Hello, baby giraffe.

248
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,080
Harry, how are you?

249
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,540
This is Sherloque Wells.

250
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,730
- Loque. "L-O-Q-U-E." - Sherloque.

251
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,600
Sherloque. I'm French.

252
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,600
- "Sher-lowk" here is-- - Loque.

253
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,750
is gonna help us find Cicada.

254
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,820
Oh, cool, so you're like a detective.

255
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,130
Oh, detective, the fans.

256
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,270
Who should I make the autograph out to?

257
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,030
Hello, little baby giraffe.

258
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,090
Uh, no, no, no. I'm--I'm--listen.

259
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,590
I'm a detective as well.

260
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,970
Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,790
Ah, well...

263
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,720
That's right, well, you're a detective.

264
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,530
What--what have you solved recently?

265
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,910
Most recently? I uncovered the case

266
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,680
of the stolen Chevy.

267
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,680
Of Impala.

268
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,550
Funny. Hmm.

269
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,160
Very funny from the looks of things.

270
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,470
Well, okay, so I saved all these hostages

271
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,990
and--and all anybody can talk about is this picture,

273
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,450
and turned into a meme. And--and--it's--

274
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,900
this is--I just--I don't think anybody in this city

275
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,550
takes me seriously.

276
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,210
Oh, there's 14 million people in this city.

277
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,590
Only 500,000 have reposted this.

278
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,980
Yeah.

279
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,260
So, uh...Cicada?

280
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,590
Cicada, yes.

281
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,100
I've reviewed your evidence

282
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,550
and I know where to find your killer.

283
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,430
So, shall we, let's get this done before dinner, right?

284
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,110
All right, allons-y.

285
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,390
Not so fast, baby giraffe.

286
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,570
Two detectives only complicates matters.

287
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,340
Especially when only one is a master.

288
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,810
So why don't you stay put?

289
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,560
You can, bite the leaves. Everyone else, come with em.

291
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,890
You okay? Hmm?

292
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,820
Oh, yeah. I'm--

293
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,430
Yeah, I'm--I'm great. I just got shut down

294
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,590
by Jean-Claude Van Damme.

295
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,430
You know Cicada's not the only mystery

296
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,240
around here that needs solving.

297
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,820
Yeah.

298
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,530
Mom, I know it sounds crazy,

299
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,590
but we think someone forged Dad's death certificate.

300
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,520
Have you any proof?

301
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,390
No, well, yes, sort of.

302
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,090
It's complicated, but

303
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,070
I just thought you should know.

304
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,930
- Unless I already knew. - I didn't say that.

305
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,650
It's why you're here, isn't it?

306
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,380
If this is some elaborate,

307
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,900
possibly nefarious cover-up,

308
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,360
it must be mom's doing.

309
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,190
It's not like she's ever

310
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,960
had your best interests at heart.

311
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,790
You always do this.

312
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,190
I just want to know the truth.

313
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,110
I think I deserve to know that.

314
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,650
Is...

315
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,370
my dad even really--

316
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,320
Caitlin, your father is dead.

317
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,090
And if you care about my feelings at all,

318
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,700
you'll just let this be.

319
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,820
Thanks, mom. Pleasure as always.

320
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,840
Don't become obsessed with the past.

321
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,920
Your father had that flaw. It nearly led to his ruin

322
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,280
even before his death.

323
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,760
I trust you know the way out.

324
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,730
I'm sorry we came all this way for no reason.

325
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,090
No, I'm impressed. Your mom is a really good liar.

326
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,660
Yeah, I know she forged this death certificate.

327
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,630
I just-She's never gonna tell us why.

328
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,920
We've hit a brick wall.

329
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,810
Ah, but where you see a wall

330
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,730
this detective sees a brick door with no handle.

331
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,700
What I mean is I know exactly how to get what we came for.

332
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,040
- You sure he's in there? - I'm certain.

333
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,340
Now, your evidence, while slight,

334
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,790
was enough to build a psychologic profile.

335
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,100
This is a man hiding in the shadows.

336
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,910
This is someone who's been pushed

337
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,300
to the peripheries of society,

338
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,960
and then now he sits alone

339
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,470
waiting for the moment to strike.

340
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,490
All this, plus the census data

341
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,080
cross-referenced with the location of his attacks,

342
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,240
and the profile narrows to one name...

343
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,900
David Hersch.

344
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,780
Nora's plan might actually work.

345
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,240
Well, it will work.

346
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,780
Once inside, you should find a small booby trap.

347
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,890
I found it.

348
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm on it.

349
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,530
Here is the critical part.

350
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,890
It's a decoy.

351
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,590
Sorry. I got caught off-guard.

352
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,120
Not so tough without your dagger, huh?

353
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,140
We got him.

354
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,830
That's ridiculous!

355
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,990
I don't know what you're talking about.

356
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,170
You don't got anything on me!

357
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,060
- Well, he sounds angry. - Yeah.

358
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,030
Forensics examined Hersch's hideout

359
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,370
and they found evidence linking him

360
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,150
to several anti-government bombings.

361
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,900
He's been doing it for a while.

362
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,670
- So we got him. - I don't know.

363
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,070
They didn't find any sign of his dagger

364
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,100
or his mask.

365
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,600
Dad, one CSI to another

366
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,380
look at the facts, okay?

367
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,720
Sherloque is the best detective in the Multiverse.

368
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
His profile led us to David Hersch,

369
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,890
and we found evidence that David Hersch

370
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,060
is a mass murderer.

371
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,240
What are the chances that this isn't our guy?

372
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,930
- I mean, maybe. - Come on, we should celebrate.

373
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,410
Okay, I'm gonna gather everyone up,

374
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,280
make some drinks,

375
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,770
and we can have our first party

376
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,180
- in the new lounge. - I don't know, Nora.

377
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,470
I--

378
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,060
Detective Joseph West.

379
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,010
What do you want?

380
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,320
To finish what I started.

381
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,230
The meta-human called Vibe.

382
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,160
Call him here now.

383
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,800
I can't. I don't even know him.

385
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,950
You were saying?

386
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,500
Yes, I mean, he helps CCPD,

387
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,770
but it's not like I have a Vibe phone

388
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,520
so I can just call him up.

389
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,170
He's just a masked do-gooder

390
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,790
that shows up at crime scenes.

391
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,910
This could be a crime scene.

392
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,510
When you said you had a plan, Ralph,

393
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,050
I didn't mean you meant breaking and entering

394
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,280
into my mother's company's files.

396
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:56,950
Reinforced steel.

397
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,340
It's times like this I really miss Killer Frost.

398
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,050
Oh, don't you worry.

399
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,560
Ralphie's got it.

400
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,410
Okay.

401
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,530
Yep. Almost there.

402
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,450
Hang on. Yeah, almost got it.

403
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,730
Oh, my God.

404
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,070
- What is it? - Lasers.

405
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,090
Rooms filled with lasers!

406
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,760
Holy snakies. Oh, my God.

407
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,000
It's like a Rubik's Cube of pain.

408
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,050
I don't know the code.

409
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,730
Try something

410
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,950
that your mother would--

411
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,530
Caitlin! There's gotta be something.

412
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,540
Got it.

413
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,710
You okay?

414
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,390
Nothing a gallon of Aloe won't fix.

415
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,480
Look for the name Thomas Snow.

416
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,340
Jackpot.

417
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,840
What is that?

418
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,070
It's a game my dad and I used to play.

419
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,720
He would teach me the periodic table, but...

420
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,150
he would let me make up

421
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,830
my own fictional compounds and elements.

422
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,310
Nerd-onium?

423
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,470
He used to say it's what made us so smart.

424
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,320
We used to have so much fun together.

425
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,010
Catching bugs in the backyard,

426
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,620
looking at constellations through a telescope we built.

427
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,300
He taught me so much about science and life.

429
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,380
Maybe he still has something left to teach you.

430
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,990
- What is it? - It's a letter from my dad.

431
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
Saying...

432
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,400
goodbye.

433
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,410
It's a suicide note.

434
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,730
Alcohol, thank you, very much. Merci.

435
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:52,880
There he is.

436
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,430
Dad, we're all set to celebrate--

437
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,610
No, hey, um.

438
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,600
Actually, Hersch isn't Cicada.

439
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,090
What?

440
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,670
He has to be.

441
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,130
No, I checked Cicada's boot print from

442
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,160
both the Block and Gridlock crime scenes

443
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,180
and it's three sizes larger than Hersch's.

444
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,920
It's not him.

445
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,510
Well, of course it's him.

446
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,160
It's always Hersch.

447
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,170
Every time I capture Cicada it's always the same man.

448
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,260
Wait a minute, you've caught this guy before?

449
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,030
37 times. I've captured 37 Cicadas,

450
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,260
37 different Earths,

451
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,870
and every time I try to capture him

452
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,720
trail always leads back to that Earth's David Hersch.

453
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,620
So this psychological profile that you created,

454
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,300
you just made it up?

455
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,010
Not, the first time.

456
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,440
Now the next 36, then I just trot it out there.

457
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,810
You know, to impress the client,

458
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,560
and then... Skip to the end.

459
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,740
And here I thought you just a bad detective,

460
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,370
but you're not a bad detective.

461
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,040
You're just a lazy one.

463
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,070
I'm not lazy. I'm efficient, right?

464
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,580
Anyway, that's not the point!

465
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,970
The point's simply that there's no reason for the Cicada

466
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,370
of this Earth to be anyone other than David Hersch.

467
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,910
Well, there may be one reason.

468
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,260
What's that?

469
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The timeline.

470
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes, since Nora got here

471
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,600
things have changed a bit.

472
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,960
Yeah.

473
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,870
Oh, mais no, you must--

474
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,630
how can you not tell me this?

475
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,070
How am I expected to operate

476
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,940
when you don't give me all the variables?

477
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,370
I don't know, but what we can expect

478
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,720
is a refund, so...

479
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,880
Yeah.

480
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,620
Oh, no, no, no. That money is long gone.

481
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,260
What do you mean "It's gone"?

482
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,470
You spent all that money in one day?

483
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,820
- Right. - On what.

484
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,760
My ex-wife-ves..

485
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,230
Ex-wives. Seven marriages.

486
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,060
Five wives. Lots of alimony.

487
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,860
That's not the point! The point is simply

488
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,440
this is not my fault.

489
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,370
It's your fault. She is to blame.

490
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,010
Timeline variance.

491
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,850
Dad.

492
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,010
You're not gonna let Hersch off the hook

493
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,810
because of a boot print.

494
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,150
He's a meta.

495
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,180
How do we know what this guy can do?

496
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,980
That's the other thing.

497
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,800
Hersch has no dark matter readings.

498
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,020
He's not a meta.

499
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,980
All right, remember. From one CSI to another,

500
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,390
we have to look at the facts, right?

501
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,020
We got the wrong guy.

502
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,150
No, not this time. You know what we should do?

503
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,240
We should throw him in the pipeline for safe keeping until he talks.

504
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,490
I'm gonna go get him.

505
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,230
Hey, what are you, no, you're not.

506
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,240
We're not gonna kidnap a suspect in police custody.

507
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,550
If you don't see what's wrong with that,

508
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,920
you can sit this one out.

509
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,650
Well, guess we're back to square one with Cicada.

510
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,120
Yeah.

511
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,310
Let's hope it's not too late to save his next victim.

512
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,180
You have a lovely family, Detective West.

513
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,790
By not giving me what I want,

514
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,280
by putting your life in danger,

515
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,830
you're gambling their future with you.

516
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,260
If you knew what I know,

517
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,550
you'd cherish them more.

518
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,850
I'm not luring Vibe into a death trap.

519
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,400
You can threaten me all you want.

520
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,890
I'm not afraid.

521
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,440
I believe you.

522
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,820
But you should be.

523
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,010
Still swirling around up there?

524
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,520
I just don't get Nora.

525
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,310
I mean, I thought our training was sinking in.

526
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,830
She defeated Block. She was really making process.

527
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,200
And next thing I know, she wants to break into CCPD

528
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,550
and kidnap a suspect in police custody.

529
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,880
I mean, it's like she wants to

530
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,640
make Hersch Cicada.

531
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,050
Barry, you really don't get why she's obsessed?

532
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,620
- Wait. Should I? - Think about it.

533
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,410
She's been hearing about the ripple effects

534
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,520
on the timeline since she got here

535
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,170
and at first they were relatively small,

536
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,260
but now...

537
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,160
- Cicada and... - It's not so small.

538
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,230
He's one of the worst serial killers in history,

539
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,680
and now because of Nora...

540
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,240
he's here early.

541
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,260
And an entirely different person.

542
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,940
With an entirely different set of victims.

543
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,670
That is a huge weight to bear for someone

544
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,600
who just wanted to spend time with a dad she never knew.

545
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,690
She feels really guilty, Barry.

546
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,920
She wants to try to fix her mistakes

547
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,500
whatever that takes.

548
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,010
Sounds like another speedster I know actually.

549
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,150
Nora says there's an emergency in the pipeline intake.

550
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,460
Are you sure that...

551
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,150
Sherloque.

552
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,580
Yeah. What happened?

553
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,080
As far as I can tell it looks like

554
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,600
he was in the wrong place

555
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,350
when this fusion cell went critical.

556
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,840
I think it wasn't placed in its cradle properly.

557
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,800
- Vaporized into ash. - What a way to go.

558
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,050
- Shenanigans. - Good grife!

559
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,860
I call shenanigans.

560
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,170
You see, these cells right here,

561
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,700
they run in a redundant cascade circuit.

562
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,190
That's how they power the pipeline,

563
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,350
in the first place, so if one of them blew

564
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,420
they all would have blown.

565
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,890
Yeah, the whole pipeline would have exploded.

566
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,120
Exactly right.

567
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,470
Darjeeling, oolong.

568
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,600
Tea leaves.

569
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,030
Barry, be a dear and check the building

570
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,310
for a weasel in a pork pie hat,

571
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,310
about yay tall, smells vaguely of poutine.

572
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,260
Tell me...

573
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,960
who died?

574
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,800
Found him with this.

575
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,180
Of course, you did.

576
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,290
So you thought you could just leave

577
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,460
to another Earth without paying us back?

578
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,230
Worked on my fourth wife...

579
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,270
and my sixth.

580
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,210
Same woman.

581
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,990
Okay, Cisco,

582
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,680
maybe it's time to have a talk

583
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,900
about a little place called debtor's prison.

584
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,130
Come with me.

585
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,000
- All right. - You make me miss Herr Wells.

586
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,990
Come with me.

587
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,570
I'm--I'm taking you!

588
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,430
You okay?

589
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,120
Yeah, yeah. It's just...

590
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,780
for second I thought me inviting Sherloque here

591
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,040
got him killed, and I just, um...

592
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,770
least that's one thing that's not my fault.

593
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,360
Hey, I wanted to talk to you actually.

594
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,090
I think I understand how you're feeling.

595
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,690
Sometimes our powers are so extraordinary

596
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,110
it makes our mistakes feel amplified,

597
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,220
especially guilt.

598
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
Yeah, but I should feel guilty.

599
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,850
I've never messed up this badly before,

600
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,830
and I can't stop thinking about it.

601
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,410
That's just cause you care.

602
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,380
It's okay. It's a good thing.

603
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,340
But...

604
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,410
Nora, if every time you make a mistake

605
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,890
you just rush in to fix it

606
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,650
you're only gonna make things worse.

607
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,350
Trust me, I know that better than anyone.

608
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,450
You just gotta have a little more patience.

609
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,400
Take a moment.

610
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,320
Think before you act.

611
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,470
Fix the problem the right way, all right?

612
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,330
Okay.

613
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:30,850
Listen, Caitlin, I'm sorry.

614
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,230
For what?

615
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,890
For all of this.

616
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,580
Just I-I felt like a complete joke

617
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,900
after that hostage thing, and then...Sherloque shows up

618
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,200
and everybody swoons over his so-called "Master Detective-ness."

619
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,910
You were nice enough to invite me along,

620
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,970
and I pushed you... into that, and...

621
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,740
I'm really sorry.

622
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,460
Ralph, this thing you pushed me into

623
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,820
gave me something I've never had before.

624
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,250
Your first felony?

625
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,530
No. Closure.

626
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,520
It may not be pretty, but I finally know the truth.

627
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,440
and that means everything.

628
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,990
So, for my book,

629
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,200
you're the best detective a girl could ask for.

630
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,880
Hey, you never told me what the code was

631
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,860
on your mom's Resident Evil laser grid of death.

632
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,530
It was my birthday.

633
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,970
All this and not even a scream.

634
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,910
You've experienced pain before,

635
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,790
but not more than me.

636
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,520
No, Cecile don't.

637
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,510
No. That's what he wants.

638
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,080
I didn't want to do this.

639
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,580
Not to a family man.

640
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,110
But I will.

641
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,160
Time to make a decision, Detective West.

642
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,030
While there's still some of you left.

644
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,680
No, no, no!

645
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,390
What's wrong?

646
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,220
He took Cisco!

647
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,970
Cicada took Cisco.

648
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,450
What do you mean took him? Took him where?

649
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,550
I don't know. They jumped into a breach right when I got here.

650
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,400
But a breach could take them anywhere.

651
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,490
Cisco, can you hear me?

652
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,220
Guys, can you hear me?

653
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,610
Cisco, where are you?

654
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:17,230
I don't know. My breach fritzed out

655
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,960
and spat us out in a forest somewhere.

656
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,190
Can you breach out?

657
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,930
It's not working.

658
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,590
Cicada's dampening his powers.

659
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,460
Without a satellite I can't pin point his location.

660
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,270
I mean, in this state alone

661
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,340
there's over 14 million acres of forest.

662
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,840
All right, Black Forest and Roanoke are closest.

663
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,980
I'll start there.

664
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,530
We're not gonna find him in time, are we?

665
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,610
Well, before you give up, what kind of trees?

666
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,340
What?

667
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,320
In the forest, what kind of trees, ask him.

668
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,520
Cisco, what kind of trees are they?

669
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,300
I don't know! I'm in a forest!

670
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,600
What kind of trees, little one?

671
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,150
- Pine trees, I think. - Good.

672
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,550
Some of them have pointy leaves.

673
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:09,160
Pointy.... ash trees, of course.

674
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,730
All right, now I need you to hold your breath.

675
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,290
What? Why?

676
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,840
Because I need to hear the forest,

677
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,790
So, shh.

678
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,130
Crickets.

679
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,570
You hear this? Assuming that's field crickets.

680
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,400
They live in the soil.

681
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,690
Anyway, cross-reference field crickets with a high concentration

682
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,070
of pine trees, ash trees, in an open field, and you have...

683
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,600
- Kolins Woods. - On my way!

684
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,960
Barry, you got to get out of there!

685
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,030
We have to help him.

686
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,510
Barry?

687
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,840
It takes time to hone your skills, Nora.

688
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:22,450
You can't just skip rungs on the ladder

689
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,100
or jump right to the big stuff, that's not how it works.

690
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,220
Take a moment. Think before you act.

691
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,030
Fix the problem the right way.

692
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,330
I got it.

693
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,190
I can fix this.

694
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,560
I've thought this through.

695
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,100
I won't mess it up this time.

696
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,230
I promise.

697
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,200
I trust you.

698
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,740
Go.

699
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:52,190
All these years in Central City

700
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,800
spent defending metas instead of ending them.

701
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:59,110
Those days end now.

702
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,430
Starting with you.

703
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:10,960
Use this!

704
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,200
Hey, Michael Myers, dampen this.

706
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,720
No. No. No. No.

707
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,190
Cisco's gone.

708
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,600
Oh, my God--

709
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,510
Cisco?

710
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,120
He's alive.

711
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,150
He's alive.

712
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,510
Sorry.

713
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,010
Your daughter.

714
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,560
She remembered there's more than one way to open a breach.

715
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,660
Figured Cicada wouldn't give up until Vibe was dead,

716
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:12,200
so we gave him what he wanted.

717
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:14,220
Thanks, fangirl.

718
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,430
You saved my life.

719
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,720
I did good?

720
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,380
You did great.

722
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,530
It's almost like you're really dead.

723
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,560
Yeah.

724
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,810
I almost really was.

725
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,650
How the hell are we gonna catch this guy?

726
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:43,150
Not with our powers. We know that at least.

727
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,670
We don't know much else either.

728
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,080
Variations in the timeline, they've...

729
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,410
shifted the elements, complicated the equation.

730
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,000
- Now-- - Not all those elements are bad though.

731
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,260
You could be the new element that saves us.

732
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,060
You could be the reason we catch Cicada.

733
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,870
I must admit,

734
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,940
Miss Nora here pulled the rug right under from Cicada.

735
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,700
Woof, alley-oop, huh?

736
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,650
Very impressive.

737
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,960
Yeah, that's the only fake death we're gonna see around here

738
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,830
'cause you're sticking around

739
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,830
until you pay us back every cent.

740
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,980
Well, I have to say, prospect

741
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,830
of another mystery with Cicada

742
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,090
puts a little pep in my step.

743
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:13,520
Also, that breach device you used to get

744
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,990
in and out of places, I suppose

745
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,360
that's under lock and key right now?

746
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,930
That's at the bottom of the ocean

747
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,270
as far as you're concerned.

748
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,490
Well, then I'm staying!

749
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,650
- Great! - Course you are.

750
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,840
I'm watching you, Holmes.

751
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,010
Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, you'll learn a lot.

752
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:24,950
Good for you.

753
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,990
All right, shall we, sidekick.

754
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,890
I'll sidekick your face.

755
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,490
Something tells me those two are gonna be

756
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,980
just great friends.

757
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,270
So...

758
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,490
You guys up for a family dinner night?

759
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,140
Sure.

760
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,270
Yeah. And then maybe after

761
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,050
we could help you move into the loft.

762
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,610
I know you've been kind of cooped up here,

763
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,230
and now that Sherloque is gonna need a place to stay

764
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,090
I thought you could...

765
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,790
crash with us.

766
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,030
I think it's a great idea, Nora.

767
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,890
Okay, thanks, yeah. Thanks.

768
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,120
Let me get my purse.

769
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,310
- Okay. - This will be good.

770
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,400
I think it could be just the thing

771
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,280
to bring you two closer together.

772
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,070
I really hope so.

773
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,480
Taking Cisco out for some drinks

774
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,780
in memoriam of Vibe.

775
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,850
- You wanna come? - I'm okay, but thank you.

776
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,300
Anything you want to talk about?

777
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,680
My dad wasn't really the letter writing type.

778
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,940
I feel like he would have found some other way to tell me.

779
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,230
No luck with his work notes?

780
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,450
No, I mean, these molecular models are gibberish.

781
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,120
There's gaps everywhere and some of these compounds don't even exist.

782
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,340
It's like his mind was the first to go.

783
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,370
But, maybe I should just listen to my mom

784
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,950
and forget about the past.

785
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,010
You left this behind.

786
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,890
Sometimes the past is worth remembering.

787
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,010
Thank you.

789
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,740
They don't exist

790
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,070
because they're not supposed to.

792
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,000
So this is all I could remember

793
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
about Cicada. It's not much, but--

794
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,370
No. No. No, this is-- this is great.

795
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,320
I mean, every little bit we get

796
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,110
helps build a profile on him.

797
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,920
I will comb over this in the morning.

798
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,160
You should go be with Cecile right now.

799
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,960
Feel better.

800
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,150
Wait. There's-- there's one more thing.

801
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,050
He made these comments about family

802
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,720
and cherishing them.

803
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,390
And then the way he picked up Jenna's blanket,

804
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,130
and I got this feeling

805
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,470
when I looked in his eyes.

806
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,580
What--what kind of feeling?

807
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,210
I think Cicada's a father.

808
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,720
Hello, Orlin.

809
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,030
Any progress?

810
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:25,960
She's not coming out of it.

811
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,800
Let me see it.

812
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:46,920
It's not healing.

813
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,590
Doesn't matter.

814
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,300
You can't keep doing this.

815
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,720
You have to stop.

816
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,650
Not until I'm finished.

817
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,750
I'm just looking for my purse.

818
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,650
I'm about to have dinner with my parents.

819
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:33,850
It's on the chair.

820
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,320
In the Cortex.

821
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,590
By the mannequin.

822
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,680
Right. Thanks.

823
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,080
Well, enjoy the couch.

824
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,060
Nora.

825
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,150
Can you help me with something?

826
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,100
I've been wondering...

827
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,860
You. You've traveled back into all these

828
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,420
great moments of your parent's lives, right?

829
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:56,250
Some wonderful, some dangerous.

830
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,040
Most not as dangerous as...

831
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,900
punching a falling satellite, right?

832
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,350
And yet...

833
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,750
that is the moment when you made

834
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,490
the decision to act,

835
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,880
altering the course of history forever.

836
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,110
That decision...

837
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,760
Did you come to it on your own?

838
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:22,020
Of course you did!

839
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,520
Right? No, of course you did.

840
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,770
You're Excess!

841
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,970
The temptation...

842
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,690
was too much, I'm sure.

843
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,370
It was.

844
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,030
Well, please,

845
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,860
forgive me. You have a dinner to go to.

846
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,740
Good night.
