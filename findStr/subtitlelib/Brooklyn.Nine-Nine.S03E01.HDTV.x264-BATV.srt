Jake, avoid the weights.

179
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,837
Nobody wants you turning
into another Terry.

180
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:14,972
Ugh.

181
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:17,207
Hey, people like
the way that I look.

182
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:19,376
Sure they do, big guy.

183
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,778
Look, I can't believe
you're gonna take

184
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:22,813
some fitness floozy
to Bouche Manger.

185
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:23,981
You should be going with Amy.

186
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,149
Right, Amy?

187
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,550
Uh...
[scoffs]

188
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:27,918
Whatever, dog.

189
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,386
Date the flooze.

190
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,554
See?

191
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:32,723
It's never gonna happen,
Boyle, okay?

192
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,892
Because I find Amy repulsive,

193
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:37,494
and she finds me
extremely handsome.

194
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:38,996
So stop pressuring us.

195
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:41,064
Oh, you sweet, naive boy.

196
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:43,534
I haven't even begun
to pressure you two.

197
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,202
I've already written
my best man speech

198
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:47,905
for your wedding.

199
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,773
Oh, I'm gonna need you
to get married on a farm.

200
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:52,376
A lot of my jokes
rely on that.

201
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,846
So here we are,

202
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,414
officially on a date,

203
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:58,715
romantical date.

204
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,517
Yes, we are.

205
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,619
No longer just colleagues.

206
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,888
Dating.

207
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,890
You got a haircut.
It looks nice.

208
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,425
Oh, thanks.

209
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:09,760
You also got a haircut

210
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:11,595
at some point in your life.

211
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:13,030
I'm sure that's not
your baby hair.

212
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,097
That would be crazy.

213
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:15,432
- [chuckles]
- But, uh...

214
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,900
Yeah, you look very nice.

215
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:19,002
<i>Domo arigato.</i>

216
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:20,037
Do you speak Japanese?

217
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:21,772
- No.
- Oh.

218
00:07:21,806 --> 00:07:23,941
Uh... sorry.

219
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,577
I think I'm feeling
a little awkward.

220
00:07:26,611 --> 00:07:28,612
Yeah, me too.

221
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:30,114
How do we make it not weird?

222
00:07:30,148 --> 00:07:32,082
I know.

223
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,450
Let's just get super drunk.

224
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:34,751
Yes, great idea.

225
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:35,886
Pardon me, ma'am.

226
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:37,821
Could you please bring us
four kamikaze shots?

227
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,056
And four for me as well.

228
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:40,691
Ah, I like your style.

229
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:42,159
See, we can do this.

230
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,260
We're back on track.

231
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:45,896
We're keeping it
light and breezy.

232
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,733
So we broke a rule.

233
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:50,868
Yeah.

234
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,736
I hope it wasn't a mistake.

235
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,838
"I Hope It Wasn't a Mistake,"
title of your sex tape?

236
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,574
[gasps]
Title of<i> our</i> sex tape.

237
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:02,287
So how was the date
with the floozy?

238
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:05,023
We are not leaving these seats
until you give me some deets.

239
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,459
<i>All right, fine.</i>

240
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,060
It started off a bit rocky,

241
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:11,563
but it ended up
being really fun.

242
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:12,931
Did you kiss?

243
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,199
Did you french?

244
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,867
Boyle, I'm not
gonna answer that.

245
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,170
And no one over the age
of 12 says "french."

246
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:21,006
Oh, that's a yes.
Oh, my God, you had sex.

247
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
[grunts]

248
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,275
I can tell because
you're glowing.

249
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:26,344
Ugh, Jake, no one wants
to hear about your sex life.

250
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,079
You just asked me repeatedly.

251
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:29,815
Because I was rooting
for you and Amy,

252
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,783
but now I can see
you're super serious

253
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:34,319
about this anonymous
gym seductress.

254
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:36,288
Ugh, I'm so sorry, Amy.

255
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,622
It doesn't matter to me.

256
00:08:37,623 --> 00:08:39,191
I'm... I would never date Jake.

257
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:40,459
I work with Jake.

258
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:41,893
I'd love to see you
date someone from work.

259
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:43,128
Your head would explode.

260
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:45,097
Your head would explode...

261
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:47,566
because of how well
I would handle it.

262
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,301
Mm. Sick burn.

263
00:08:49,335 --> 00:08:51,837
Peralta, Dozerman says
he wants to see you.

264
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:54,339
Captain,
everything all right?

265
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,375
[tapping]

266
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:01,179
You tell me.

267
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:03,915
According to your Dozer-pad,
four of your coworkers

268
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:06,318
have been gathered around your desk
for the last 90 seconds.

269
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:08,353
Also, someone named
Norm Scully

270
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:10,355
has been in the bathroom
for the last 72 minutes.

271
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:12,657
Oh, yeah, that means
he's about halfway.

272
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:14,226
But in regards
to the coworkers, sir,

273
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:16,995
I was telling them I wanted
to get more work done,

274
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:19,397
but all they wanted to do
was talk about my dating life,

275
00:09:19,432 --> 00:09:21,900
knowing full well
that my true love

276
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,335
is efficiency.

277
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,970
You know my motto, sir.

278
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:27,072
Cho's before hos.

279
00:09:27,073 --> 00:09:28,507
"Cho's" is "chores."

280
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,210
What?

281
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,313
I like you.

282
00:09:35,314 --> 00:09:36,782
I could tell from
the moment I walked in here

283
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:38,283
that we were one
and the same...

284
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:40,986
detail-oriented,
love crunching numbers.

285
00:09:40,987 --> 00:09:42,387
Bet your apartment's
immaculate.

286
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:43,522
Could probably eat
off the floor.

287
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,857
- And I do. Yeah.
- Yeah.

288
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:48,760
- I'm gonna handle this for you.
- Okay.

289
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:52,664
I'm gonna send out
a Dozerblast.

290
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:56,635
Hey, everyone stop talking
about Peralta's personal life.

291
00:09:56,636 --> 00:10:00,205
Dozerblast over.

292
00:10:00,206 --> 00:10:02,340
Well, thank you
very much, sir,

293
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,677
and might I just say
that this has been a Dozerblast.

294
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:07,079
I saw what you did
right there.

295
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Uh?

296
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:11,082
[both laughing]

297
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,386
- Get back to work.
- Okay.

298
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,754
<i>I know you've been working</i>

299
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:17,689
on picking a name
for the pigeon mascot

300
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,491
for, uh...
[laughs]

301
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,759
Several months now.

302
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:22,294
<i>I feel like you might
need a breather,</i>

303
00:10:22,328 --> 00:10:25,163
so I've prepared
an eight-point presentation

304
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:26,832
on community engagement.

305
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,700
We'll get to your presentation,
Raymond.

306
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:29,835
It's on the agenda.

307
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:31,837
Well, it says here
it's scheduled

308
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:33,472
"after everyone leaves."

309
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:34,573
And not a minute later.

310
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:36,441
Trent, Bryce, where
are we with the name?

311
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:38,610
We've narrowed it down
to two choices...

312
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,212
Petey or Paulie.

313
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:41,847
<i>With all due respect,</i>

314
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,349
that pigeon is
clearly a Ray J.

315
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,218
Hi.
Gina Linetti,

316
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:49,354
the human form
of the 100 emoji.

317
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:51,456
I'd like to hear Captain
Holt's thoughts on a name.

318
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:53,825
Very well.
My thoughts are...

319
00:10:53,826 --> 00:10:54,826
who cares?

320
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:56,628
Give us a name, Raymond.

321
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:57,662
Weigh in on this.

322
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,663
It's your job now.

323
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,265
No.

324
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,900
A name.

325
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:03,435
Petey or Paulie, which is it?

326
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:04,636
What does it matter?

327
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:05,871
Why'd you even choose
a pigeon anyway?

328
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:07,105
It's a terrible mascot.

329
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:08,507
Because they're
a staple of New York,

330
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:10,308
they're nonthreatening,
and they're everywhere.

331
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:11,610
They're carriers of disease,

332
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:13,412
and they eat garbage!

333
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:14,880
Name the pigeon, Raymond!

334
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,415
- You can't make me.
- <i>I can make you, and I will.</i>

335
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,551
Name the pigeon.
That's an order!

336
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,025
Paulie.

337
00:11:27,026 --> 00:11:28,093
Thank you.

338
00:11:28,094 --> 00:11:29,094
Was that so hard?

339
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:31,163
[sighs]

340
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,998
Yeah, I'm trying
to find some evidence.

341
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:34,766
I'm just gonna look in here.

342
00:11:34,767 --> 00:11:36,601
Another perfect cover.
Two for two. Nailed it.

343
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:38,103
All right,
I talked to Dozerman

344
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:40,405
and convinced him to outlaw
all personal talk at work.

345
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:41,406
We're in the clear.

346
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,774
And everyone
hates you for that,

347
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:45,510
but this is totally working,
and no one knows.

348
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:46,812
I know.
It's the best.

349
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:48,246
And you know what?
I'm glad we broke the rule

350
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:49,581
and had sex
on the first date.

351
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:51,983
Me too, 'cause we're,
like, really good at it.

352
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:53,785
- So good, right?
- Stupid good.

353
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,087
- It makes no sense.
- [gasps]

354
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,421
We're light and breezy.

355
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:58,156
If we want to break rules,

Right,

isn't my place to say,

Actually that's exactly
your place to say.

You are my assistant.

the costume altered,

your own pigeon pants?

00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,981
as your cruise ship
slowly takes on water.

533
00:17:49,982 --> 00:17:51,082
What do you want me to say?

534
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,584
We tried really hard.
We made rules.

535
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:53,818
We kept it light and breezy.

536
00:17:53,853 --> 00:17:54,986
Light and breezy?

537
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,187
Ow!

538
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:57,522
Light and breezy
is how you describe

539
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:58,790
a linen pantsuit,

540
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,825
not a relationship
you care about.

541
00:18:00,826 --> 00:18:02,460
We were just being cautious.

542
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:04,329
- Cautious?
- Ow!

543
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,564
You guys started this
with one foot out the door.

544
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,466
That's what doomed you,
not the universe.

545
00:18:08,467 --> 00:18:10,035
Actually, it makes
a lot of sense.

546
00:18:10,036 --> 00:18:12,504
Ow, I was agreeing with you!

547
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:13,571
I'm sorry.

548
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:14,839
I'm just so excited
about all this!

549
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:16,341
All right, so what do I do?

550
00:18:16,342 --> 00:18:17,709
- Tell me.
- Easy.

551
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,878
You march over there,
you tell her how you feel,

552
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:21,579
and you bring a fancy bottle
of lavender shampoo,

553
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,814
because shampooing
a woman's head

554
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:24,549
is the most erotic thing
you could ever possibly...

555
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,017
No, no, no shampoo.
That's the worst.

556
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:27,519
But I am gonna go over there.

557
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,720
I'm gonna tell her
how I feel.

558
00:18:28,754 --> 00:18:29,821
Yes!
Go get her.

559
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:31,856
No!
Wait till it starts raining.

560
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:33,324
No, that's crazy.
Go now.

561
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,893
Okay.

562
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,463
- Ahh!
- Sorry! Sorry.

563
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:39,898
It's okay.

564
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:41,499
I was home,

565
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,069
and I really wanted
to talk to someone about us

566
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:46,071
and Dozerman
and about Holt being gone,

567
00:18:46,072 --> 00:18:48,640
and then I realized
that the only person

568
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,576
I want to talk about
that stuff with is you.

569
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:54,879
So screw just being
colleagues,

570
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,415
and screw light
and breezy, right?

571
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,350
[sighs]

572
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:00,352
Definitely.

573
00:19:02,054 --> 00:19:03,054
Guys, we did it.

574
00:19:03,055 --> 00:19:04,055
We really did it.

575
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:06,358
Oh, Charles is here.

576
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:07,425
Big time.

<i>Captain.</i>

579
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,097
The kids want to know
where Paulie the Pigeon is.

580
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:14,132
I told 'em he got sucked up
into an airplane engine.

581
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,367
Is that all right?

582
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,669
I can't put
that pigeon head on, Gina.

583
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,804
Wuntch has defeated me.

584
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:21,039
This is how it ends,

585
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,774
with me standing on
the urine-soaked floor

586
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:24,109
of an elementary
school bathroom

587
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,045
in a third-rate
bird costume.

588
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:28,446
- I quit.
- <i>No.</i>

589
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:31,282
I did not follow you to PR
to watch you quit.

590
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,585
I followed you
because you're great

591
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:36,421
and because you make
everything you touch better,

592
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:39,457
and I figured PR
would be the easiest path

593
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:42,171
to launching my reality show
"Linetti, Set, Go."

594
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,159
I thought your reality
show was to be called

595
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,427
"Gina in a Bottle."

596
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:47,596
No, that was
my fragrance line.

597
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:48,864
Keep up.

598
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:50,198
Listen.

599
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:52,634
You cannot let Wuntch
defeat you.

600
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:54,302
<i>That is not who you are.</i>

601
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:56,138
You are a person
who will go out there

602
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:58,931
and deliver his eight-point plan
on whatever, whatever.

603
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,432
- Community engagement.
- Whatever.

604
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:03,298
Even if the only
people listening

605
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,233
are a bunch of second graders,

606
00:20:05,234 --> 00:20:08,303
because Captain Raymond Holt

607
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:10,706
never gives up!

608
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,074
Inspiring words.

609
00:20:12,108 --> 00:20:13,875
I'm going to give
that speech.

610
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,745
Help me with that
pigeon head.

611
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:18,914
Yeah, all right.

612
00:20:20,783 --> 00:20:23,452

00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,393
Wow, Diaz.

617
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:33,462
That's the first time
I've seen him smile.

618
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:34,529
I didn't do it for him.

619
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,931
I did it 'cause it's my job.

620
00:20:35,965 --> 00:20:38,066

- We're cool.

621
