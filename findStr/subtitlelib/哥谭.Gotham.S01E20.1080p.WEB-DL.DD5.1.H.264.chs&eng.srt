《哥谭》前情提要
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:04,910
大家喊他食人魔
The guys call him The Ogre.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,650
他是个连环杀手
He's a serial killer.

4
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,340
不管凶手是谁  他就是个禽兽
Whoever did this, he's a monster.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,950
他下个杀的人的血就在我手上
The blood of his next victim is on my hands!

6
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,690
如果你不放手  那就可能会是小莱的血
If you don't drop it, that blood could be Lee's.

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,130
因为食人魔会报复调查他的警察
Because The Ogre retaliates against any cop who investigates

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,170
杀害他们所爱的人
and kills the people they love.

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,930
刺伤阿尔弗雷德的那个人  他还在哥谭
The man who stabbed Alfred, he's in Gotham.

10
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,510
你想让我帮你找他
And you need my help to find him.

11
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,520
谁派你去的
Who sent you?

12
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,580
你希望我去告诉邦德斯洛你发现他了吗
You want me to tell Bunderslaw that you're onto him?

你似乎离家有点远啊
You look far from home.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,770
离他远点
Get away from him.

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,850
否则呢
Or what?

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,310
随你便
Whatever.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,330
来
Come on.

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,850
你回去过吗
Did you go back?

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,560
回过了  警察赶到了
Yeah. The cops are there.

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,280
然后呢
And?

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:13,980
然后什么
And?

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,480
你以为呢
What do you think?

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,270
他从五楼窗户掉下去的  他死了
He fell out of a five-story window. He's dead.

27
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,590
你为什么要那么做
Why'd you do it?

28
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,240
他跟我们说了我们想知道的事  说了邦德斯洛
He told us what we wanted. He told us about Bunderslaw.

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,840
你根本没必要杀他 
You didn't have to go and kill the guy!

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,490
当然有必要  因为我们一走
Yes, I did! 'Cause the moment we'd left,

31
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,000
他就会通知他的老大
he was gonna go tell his boss!

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,290
顺带说一句  那人还是你的公司的
Who works for you, by the way.

33
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,340
他就是想杀掉我的人
He's the one who tried to kill me,

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,080
他还想杀掉你的管家
who tried to kill your butler...

35
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,550
还有可能是杀害你爸妈的凶手
who probably killed your parents.

36
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,310
我救了你一命
I saved your life.

37
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,790
再说了  你也想杀了他
Besides... you wanted to do it, too.

38
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,410
只是没胆而已
You just didn't have the guts.

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,860
-等等  -回家吧
- Wait...! - Just go home.

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,240
我们还得查明谁是邦德斯洛  以及他的目的
We still have to find out who Bunderslaw is and what he wants.

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,180
你是说你得去查吧
You mean you do.

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,870
你真以为这事结束了吗
You really think this is over?

43
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,480
他会来追杀我们的
He's gonna come after us.

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,420
那接下来怎么做
So what's next?

45
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,570
他的保险箱
His safe.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,740
什么
What?

47
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,570
韦恩集团的每一个高级主管
Every senior executive at Wayne Enterprises

48
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,170
在办公室里都有一个保险箱
has a safe in their office.

49
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,840
邦德斯洛的秘密肯定就藏在里面
A-Any secrets Bunderslaw has, that's where they'll be.

50
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,500
用钥匙还是密码
Key or combination?

51
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,000
钥匙  我爸以前就有一把
Key. My dad had one.

52
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,670
那他可能会随身携带
He'll probably keep it on him, then.

53
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,710
想办法让我靠近他  我就能把钥匙偷来
Figure out a way to get me close, and I'll steal it.

54
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,400
行吗
Can you do that?

55
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,550
应该行吧
I think so.

56
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,280
今晚发生的事
And what happened tonight,

57
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,590
不要告诉任何人
you tell no one.

58
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,350
不能告诉戈登警探
Not your buddy Detective Gordon,

59
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,710
也不能告诉你的管家
not your butler.

60
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,060
谁也不能说
No one.

67
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,420

68

戈登警探  汤普金斯医生说我可以随意
Detective Gordon, Dr. Thompkins said I was free

70
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,490
用这个房间  她人很好
to use this room. She's very nice.

71
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,650
她和之前那位验尸官不一样
She's not like the old medical examiner.

72
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,540
爱德  直接说她在哪
Ed, just tell me where she is.

73

吉姆
两通未接电话

79
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,350
我不剥你皮算你走运
You're lucky I don't skin you.

80
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,790
走吧
Go on.

81
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,790
-慢点说  -小莱  我没事
- I... slow down. - Lee, please.

82
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,910
从头再说一次
Start over.

83
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,210
你接手的这件案子  这个死去的女人
This case you caught, the dead woman,

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
是被连环杀手所杀吗
she was murdered by a serial killer?

85
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,890
没错  他杀了十几个女人  可能更多
Yes. Who's killed a dozen women, maybe more.

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,480
洛布是故意把这案子交给你的吗
And Loeb gave you this on purpose?

87
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,830
他想伤害我
He wants to hurt me.

88
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,170
那我怎么会有危险
And how am I in danger?

89
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,010
他会杀掉调查他的警察
He murders the loved ones of any cop

90
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,480
心爱的人
who investigates him.

91
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,620
迄今为止  他就是这样逃脱制裁的
It's how he's been able to get away with it so far.

92
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,580
所有追查他的人
Anyone who comes after him,

93
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,650
都会被他杀掉心爱的人
he's killed someone they love

94
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,710
调查也就不了了之了
and the investigation's been buried.

95
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,290
布洛克认识的一个警察
Bullock knows a cop--

96
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,570
回到家时  发现自己的妻子
came home and found his wife.

97
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,870
被割喉了
Her throat had been cut.

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,500
所以洛布把这案子交给我
That's why Loeb gave me the case.

99
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,680
要么我像其他人一样放弃调查
Either I give up, like everyone else...

100
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,660
带着放走凶手的愧疚活着
and live, knowing I let a killer go free...

101
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,410
要么我继续调查
or I keep on,

102
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,240
而我心爱的人将遭毒手
and someone I love is killed.

103
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,760
你是不会放弃的  是吗
You're not giving up, are you?

104
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,650
我不能放弃
I can't.

105
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,850
所以你得马上离开哥谭
That's why I need you to get out of Gotham right now.

106
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,180
今晚就走
Tonight.

107
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,410
不行
No.

108
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,120
你想保护我吗  那就把他找出来
You want to protect me? Find him.

109
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,180
我会留在这里  继续工作
I'm gonna stay here and do my job.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,520
但是我很高兴你把我当做是心爱的人
But I do like that you think of me as a loved one.

111
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,510
我的确
I do.

112
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,640
爱你
Love you.

113
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,460
只有连环杀手才让你说出了这句话
And it only took a serial killer to get you to say that.

114
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,240
-谢谢  -没事
- Thanks. - Yeah.

115
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,050
就是这里
This is it.

116
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,740
温馨的家
Home sweet, you know.

117
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,410
这地方很不错
This is a great space.

118
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,920
塞琳娜
Selina?

119
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,760
算是我的室友吧
Sort of a roommate.

120
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,230
她不总在这儿住
She comes and goes.

121
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,200
韦恩集团慈善舞会
Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball.

122
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,010
你不知道我是个名媛吗
Didn't you know I'm a member of society?

123
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,310
我每年都去
I go every year.

124
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,020
穿着漂亮的裙子拍些美照
Get my picture taken in a pretty dress.

125
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,440
摆上笑容
Smile.

126
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,000
我在这儿  你不担心吗
Aren't you scared of my being here?

127
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,710
我该担心吗
Should I be?

128
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,360
你是危险人物吗
Are you dangerous?

129
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,790
不好说  你男友会回来吗
I don't know -- is your boyfriend gonna come home?

130
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,690
我没说过我有男友啊
I never said I had a boyfriend.

131
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,870
你这么美丽  我以为...
I assumed a woman as beautiful as you...

132
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,430
你以为我一定有男友
You assumed I had a boyfriend

133
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,900
而且你还以为我是那种
and you assumed I would be the kind of woman

134
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,490
会背叛他的女人
who would cheat on him.

135
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,910
我不是
Well, I'm not.

136
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,350
而且我也没男友
And I don't have a boyfriend.

137
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,230
就算我明天被车撞死
And if a bus hit me tomorrow,

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,130
也不会有人在意
no one would care.

139
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,170
你改主意了吗
That change things?

140
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:31,850
事实上  确实
Yes, actually, it does.

141
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,240
因为那样会更刺激吗
Make it more illicit?

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,800
还是那样我们更不容易建立感情
Or would there be less chance of us getting attached--

143
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,270
一夜风流  再不相见
one night and done.

144
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,240
不过本来也会如此
Only that would happen anyway.

145
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,990
因为一旦你看清了真实的我
Because once you saw the real me,

146
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,640
就会尖叫着逃跑  和其他人一样
you would run screaming, like everyone else.

147
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,260
我得说  你和我想象的很不一样
I have to say, you're not who I imagined you'd be.

148
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,000
惊喜吧
Surprise.

149
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,530
自己走吧  不送了
You can let yourself out.

150
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,140
爱情  爱情*
*Love, love

151
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,950
爱情*
*Love...

152
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,770
爱情  爱情*
*Love, love

153
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,990
爱情*
*Love...

154
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,250
你可是答应和我跳支舞的
But you promised to dance with me.

155
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,590
我会的
And I will.

156
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,410
等我先和那位先生谈完公事
But first I have to finish with that gentleman.

157
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,410
谁知道开个夜店也这么忙呢
Who knew running a nightclub was so much work?

158
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,460
我可怜的小宝贝
My poor darling.

159
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,600
如我所说
As I was saying,

160
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,070
你和你的手下是这里最棒的杀手
you and your crew are the best gun and knife men in the city.

161
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,460
你们刺杀了克莱因议员
Your hit on Councilman Klein--

162
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,700
真是杰作
a thing of beauty.

163
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,520
-我很崇拜你们  -谢谢
- And I'm a fan, so... - Cheers.

164
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,020
你想怎样
What do you want?

165
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,300
想让你为我刺杀马罗尼阁下
For you to help me kill Don Maroni

166
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,450
和他所有的副手
and all of his lieutenants.

167
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,140
你搞笑吧
You're having a laugh.

168
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,180
我很认真
I'm fairly certain I'm not.

169
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,010
法尔科内也同意了
And Falcone's good with this?

170
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,550
他会同意的
He will be.

171
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,940
等生米煮成熟饭以后
When it's done.

172
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,260
我谢你了
Thank you.

173
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,200
但还是算了
No, thank you.

174
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,100
那么你是喜欢排第二喽
So you like being number two.

175
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,220
维克多・萨斯在法尔科内那儿总有优先权
Falcone gives Victor Zsasz first dibs on every new contract.

176
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,080
你把他宿敌的尸首带去
You bring him the bullet-riddled corpse of his enemy

177
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,980
就能翻身
and all of that will change.

178
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,950
这是你晋升的机会啊
This is your chance to move up.

179
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,940
你确实是个疯子
You're a mad fella, aren't ya?

180
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,120
好吧
Fair enough.

181
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,190
明天来酒吧
Come by the bar tomorrow.

182
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,570
我们商量一下细节
We'll talk details.

183
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,600
找我什么事  哈维
What's this about, Harvey?

184
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,550
请坐
Have a seat.

185
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,480
这是我搭档吉姆・戈登
This is my partner Jim Gordon.

186
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,100
警探
Detective.

187
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,750
八年前你调查过一宗凶杀案
Eight years ago, you investigated the murder

188
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,640
死者叫朱莉・肯布尔
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

189
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,870
-那是很久以前了  -是食人魔干的
- That was a long time ago. - It was the Ogre.

190
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,410
朱莉・肯布尔是他第一个杀的人
Julie Kemble was his first victim.

191
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,200
但你放弃了调查
But you dropped the investigation,

192
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,140
就因为如此
and because of that,

193
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,280
后来又有11位女性被杀
11 more women have been murdered.

194
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,630
说真的  两位
Seriously, guys, you know...

195
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,490
够了
Stop.

196
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,700
我们也知道食人魔
We also know the Ogre

197
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,530
会杀害追查他的警察的心爱之人
kills the loved ones of the cops that hunt him down.

198
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,060
这也是从你开始的
That pattern started with you.

199
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,980
我们认为你是发现了令他害怕的东西
We think you found something that spooked him.

200
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,810
这是你调查的笔记
Your notes from the investigation.

201
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,310
最后一页
The last page,

202
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,880
有字被抹掉了
something's been scratched out.

203
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,070
我想知道内容
I want to know what.

204
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,140
他杀了我妻子
He killed my wife.

205
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,980
但我还有个女儿  哈维
I still got a daughter, Harvey.

206
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,070
贝丝・都铎
Beth Tudor.

207
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,100
凯瑟琳・伍德

209
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,330
11位女性
11 women.

210
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,940
每个都是别人的女儿
Each one was someone's daughter.

211
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,480
不能继续下去了
It has to stop.

212
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,710
好吧  我当时正在调查死者的背景
Yeah. I was doing background on the dead girl.

213
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,430
有人跟我说她是上城区
Someone told me she was a nurse

214
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,660
一家私人诊所的护士
for a private medical clinic uptown.

215
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,320
在格兰特和80街街口
It was on Grant and 80th.

216
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,930
好像是整容的
Some cosmetic place.

217
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,500
这事结束之前我们会安排警察保护你女儿
We'll put cops on your daughter until this is done.

218
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,720
那你原谅我了
So you forgive me?

219
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,890
晚上见
I'll see you tonight.

220
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,290
还好吗  谜语哥
How's it hanging, Riddle Man?

221
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,810
我还
Uh, it's hanging...

222
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,640
好
fine.

223
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,120
尼格玛先生
Mr. Nygma,

224
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,520
有事吗
did you need something?

225
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,110
是的
Yes. Uh...

226
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,750
戈登警探让我检查一遍这几桩旧案的
Detective Gordon wanted me to go through the forensic evidence

227
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,600
法医证据
of these old murders.

228
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,580
好的
Okay.

229
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,830
那是瘀伤吗
Are those bruises?

230
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,430
是多尔蒂警官弄的吗
Did Officer Dougherty do that?

231
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,020
他当时生气了  他不是故意的
Um, he was... upset, and he didn't mean to.

232
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,700
是我说话过分了
I-I said some things I shouldn't have, and...

233
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,010
柯林格小姐  这样不对
Miss Kringle, this is not right.

234
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,640
他不能
He can't just...

235
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,830
尼格玛先生
Mr. Nygma,

236
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,830
这不关你的事
it is none of your concern.

237
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,040
我得开始找卷宗了
Now, I-I need to get started on these files, so...

238
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,070
希德・邦德斯洛  操作部主管

239
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,940
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred.

240
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,610
能起来了吗
Should you be up?

241
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,510
谢谢  布鲁斯少爷  我感觉...
Oh, thank you, Master Bruce. I feel...

242
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,540
好多了
I feel much better.

243
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,780
需要点什么吗
Can I get you anything?

244
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,960
其实  需要
Yes, actually.

245
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,350
我要出席今晚的韦恩集团慈善舞会
I've decided to attend the Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball tonight.

246
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,100
所有的高层都会参加
All the senior management will be there,

247
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,010
我觉得应该让人们知道
and I think people should see

248
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,030
公司依然在韦恩家族的领导下
that a Wayne is still at the head of the company.

249
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,320
那我帮你准备套礼服
I shall set your tux out for you.

250
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,020
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred...

251
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,300
什么事  布鲁斯少爷
Yes, Master Bruce.

252
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,800
你参军那会儿
Wh-When you were in the army...

253
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,500
有时得杀人  对吗
you had to kill people, right?

254
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,240
是的
Yes.

255
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,070
没错
Yes, I did.

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,280
都是不得不做吗
And it was necessary?

257
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,460
我明白了  你听到了我和雷吉
Oh, I see-- so you overheard the conversation

258
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,000
说的一些不该说的话
that Reggie and I had that was best left unsaid.

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,590
不过对于你的问题  是的
But in answer to your question, yes.

260
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,040
不得不做
Yes, it was necessary.

261
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,360
失陪一下
Now, if you'll excuse me,

262
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,960
我得去找枚好袖扣了
I better go and find my good cufflinks,

263
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,160
晚上还要出门呢
if we're stepping out.

264
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,880
不用了  你还在恢复期呢
No, but, uh, you're-you're still recovering.

265
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,200
那我就放心让你一个人
What, I'm supposed to let you walk into that nest

266
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,420
入虎穴吗
of vipers on your tod?

267
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,440
晚会上有上百人呢  阿尔弗雷德
There'll be hundreds of people there, Alfred.

268
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,630
我不会有危险的
I won't be in any danger.

269
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,460
话这么说  但我不会让你一个人去的
So you say. But you're not gonna go alone.

270
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,920
我不是一个人
I won't be alone.

271
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,970
我邀请了塞琳娜・凯尔
I've invited Selina Kyle.

272
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,080
塞琳娜・凯尔
Selina Kyle?

273
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,890
去参加韦恩集团的舞会吗
To the Wayne Enterprises Ball?

274
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,540
我明白了
I see.

275
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,920
明白什么了
What do you see?

276
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,160
没什么  我的意思是...
Nothing. I mean, you know... I mean, you're...

277
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,870
你是个健康的小伙子  她是个漂亮的小姑娘
a healthy young lad and she's a very pretty young girl

278
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,060
而且特别喜欢穿皮衣
with a penchant of wearing, well, a little too much leather.

279
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,340
阿尔弗雷德  不是那样的
Alfred, it's not like that.

280
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,410
那是什么
Then what's it like?

281
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,690
那...
Well...

282
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,810
是又怎么样
well, what if it is, huh?

283
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,330
有什么问题吗
What's wrong with that?

284
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,440
完全没有
Absolutely nothing.

285
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,980
那我就在外面车里等你
So, I will wait in the car outside,

286
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,390
你也不会觉得被人盯着了
so you don't feel my watchful eye,

287
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,570
但我不会走远的  有需要随时叫我
but I will be close by, if there needs be.

288
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,230
就这样
That is the deal.

289
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:26,660
好
Fine.

290
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,560
你能不能让人
Could you call around and send

291
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,450
送礼服和鞋去给她
some dresses and shoes to where she's staying?

292
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,850
这是地址
This is the address.

293
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,710
就是个慈善舞会  阿尔弗雷德
It's a charity ball, Alfred.

294
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,110
我没事的
I'll be fine.

295
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,600
怪}人的  是吧
Freaky, huh?

296
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,150
他们整得连自己都不认识了吧
You wonder how they recognize themselves after.

297
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,710
汤普金斯医生没事啦
Doc Thompkins is fine.

298
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,040
没人敢在警局动她  放松
No one's gonna touch her at the precinct. Relax.

299
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,910
你该明白  她身处险境都是因为我
You do understand it's because of me that she's in danger.

300
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,930
要是出了什么事  那都是我的错
Anything that happens is my fault.

301
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,280
变态狂犯下的罪
You can't hold yourself responsible

302
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,170
你别自己揽着
for the actions of a psychopath.

303
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,550
当然怪我
Sure, I can.

304
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,570
两位警探  我是库什曼医生
Detectives... I'm Dr. Cushman.

305
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,720
有什么能效劳的
How can I help you?

306
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,660
我们在调查一名
We're looking into the murder

307
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,300
叫朱莉・肯布尔的女子的凶杀案
of a woman named Julie Kemble.

308
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,010
八年前她在这里上班
She worked here about eight years ago.

309
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,220
我知道  太可怕了
Of course. Terrible thing.

310
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,420
朱莉是名非常出色的护士
Julie was a talented nurse.

311
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,200
但当时  她才入职没多久
But she'd only just started here when it happened.

312
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,570
推荐她的是我们这儿的一名患者
She'd been recommended by one of our patients.

313
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,610
那名患者是谁
The patient's name?

314
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,070
抱歉  恐怕不能告诉你们
Well, I'm afraid I can't give you that.

315
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,630
我们有保密协议的
Confidentiality.

316
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,400
是吗
Really?

317
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,860
你真要逼我们申请搜查证吗
You're gonna make us get a warrant?

318
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,640
是的
Yes.

319
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,250
我专门给人做假咪咪  但我这人有道德
"I specialize in fake boobs, but I got ethics.

320
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,310
我得看到搜查证
I need a warrant."

321
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,320
我们去找哈克尼斯法官  相信...
We'll talk to Judge Harkness. I'm sure...

322
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,900
那车在警局门口就出现过
That car was in front of the precinct.

323
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,590
吉姆  等等
Jim, wait up.

324
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:12,850
你确定吗
You sure about this?

325
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,770
是他
It was him.

326
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,220
你看见他的长相了吗
You saw his face?

327
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,330
没  我应该留意是否有人跟梢的
No. I should've been looking for a tail.

328
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,370
他显然在追踪我们的调查
It's obvious he tracks our investigations.

329
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,410
已经通报了车的样子和部分牌照
Called in a description of the car and a partial plate,

330
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,790
但可能作用不大
but I'm not too hopeful.

331
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,320
那下一步呢
So what's the next move?

332
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,430
戈登  有你电话
Gordon, you got a call.

333
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,380
说很紧急
Says it's urgent.

334
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,430
我是戈登
Gordon.

335
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,350
警探
Detective.

336
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,910
刚刚在巷子里我还没来及跟你好好打招呼呢
I didn't get a chance to say hello properly in the alley.

337
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,530
-听着...  -别想追踪号码了  我就说完
- Listen to me... - Don't bother tracing this. I won't be long.

338
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,030
我就给你一次自首的机会
I'm giving you one chance to turn yourself in.

339
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,320
一旦我去抓你  你就没好果子了
You make me come after you, and I will put you down.

340
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,700
我怎么觉得你相信了报纸对你的吹捧  警探
Something tells me you've begun to buy your own press, Detective.

341
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,660
英雄警探  肃清哥谭
The hero cop who's gonna clean up Gotham.

342
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,660
哥谭市警局崛起的新星
The rising star of the GCPD.

343
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,450
我会阻止你的  我发誓
I'll stop you, that's for damn sure.

344
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,980
不  警探  你不会的
No, Detective, you won't.

345
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,080
你要是还不放手
But keep on your present course,

346
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,700
我就杀死你心爱的人
and I will kill someone you love.

347
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,570
这是我对你唯一的警告
This is your only warning.

348
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,230
天呐
Oh, no.

349
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,460
告诉我那不是他
Tell me that wasn't him.

350
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,040
他一直恐吓警察
He's used to intimidating cops.

351
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,490
我们得让他知道我们不怕他
We have to show him we're not afraid.

352
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,410
那要怎么做
And how do we do that?

353
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,400
你不介意吗  你确定
You're okay with this? You're sure?

354
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,490
是的
Yes.

355
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,280
这是应该做的
It's the right thing to do.

356
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,410
我今天叫你们来
I called you here today...

357
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,650
是因为哥谭市人民有权知道
because the people of Gotham deserve to know

358
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,130
有个连环杀手生活在他们之中
that there's a serial killer in their midst.

359
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,770
多年来  他肆意杀人
For years, he's killed with impunity,

360
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,410
警察的沉默和恐惧助长了他的气焰
aided by a culture of silence and fear among the police.

361
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,320
现在要结束了
That ends now.

362
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,660
我们会提供所有被害人的名字和照片
We'll be providing the names and photos of all of the victims.

363
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,620
请致电提供线索
Please call with any information.

364
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,530
而对于那个犯下了这些可怕罪行的人
And to the man who committed these horrific crimes,

365
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,530
你躲藏的日子结束了
your days of hiding are over.

366
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,390
我要追捕你
I'm coming after you.

367
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,830
我绝不会罢手
And I'm not gonna stop.

368
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,200
这都是干吗的
What are those for?

369
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,040
韦恩慈善舞会
The Wayne Charity Ball.

370
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,890
挺无聊的  但是对画廊生意有好处
It's boring but good for the gallery's business.

371
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,940
那我们在那里见了
Well, I'll probably see you there.

372
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,080
什么
What?

373
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,000
我要和布鲁斯・韦恩一起去
I'm going with Bruce Wayne.

374
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,010
等下  什么
Wait, what?

375
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,590
塞琳娜・凯尔的快递
Delivery for Selina Kyle.

376
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,610
放那里
Uh, over there.

377
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,460
谢谢  请用
Thank you. Enjoy.

378
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,070
我真的要穿这个吗
Am I really supposed to wear these?

379
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,210
好吧
Okay...

380
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,030
咱们有很多活儿要干
we have a lot of work to do.

381
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,360
知道了
Got it.

382
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,980
是那个医生
That was the doctor.

383
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,200
哈克尼斯送去了搜查令
Harkness sent over the warrant.

384
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,280
被杀女孩是一位
The dead girl came to the clinic

385
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,170
康斯坦丝・范・格鲁特女士推荐去的
by way of a Miss Constance van Groot.

386
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,870
范・格鲁特  哥谭最高古老的家族之一
Van Groot-- that's one of Gotham's oldest families.

387
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,950
-做航运的  -没错
- Shipping. - Yeah.

388
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,230
我们认为食人魔是富家子弟
We thought the Ogre might be rich.

389
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,650
也许那老妇人有个儿子
Could be the old lady had a son.

390
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,140
你搞到地址了吗
You got an address?

391
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:22,970
就在这儿
Right here.

392
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,910
布奇  康纳和他的人同意了
Well, Butch, Connor and his crew are on board.

393
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,400
他们比我还恨马罗尼
They hate Maroni even more than I...

394
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,590
闭嘴  马罗尼和他的人来了
Shut up. Maroni and his crew are here.

395
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,280
我没法赶走他们
I couldn't turn 'em away.

396
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,220
-不  当然  没事  -不是
- No, of course. No matter. - No.

397
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,510
她当时已经到了
She was already here.

398
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,250
那不是我好兄弟奥斯瓦尔德吗
Is that my buddy Oswald?

399
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:44,840
过来
Come here.

400
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,300
奥斯瓦尔德
Oh, Oswald.

401
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,960
他来了
There he is.

402
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,540
母亲  你在干什么
Mother, what are you doing?

403
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,720
我在喝酒  和这位马...
I'm having a drink with Mr. Mar...

404
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,260
我说了  叫我萨尔
I told you-- Sal.

405
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,200
和萨尔
With Sal.

406
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,240
我们还是别再叨扰...
But we shouldn't impose any longer...

407
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,160
不行  你休想带走我的格特鲁德
No, you're not taking my Gertrud.

408
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,220
他的格特鲁德
Oh, his Gertrud.

409
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,860
坐吧  一起喝点
Sit. Join us.

410
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,930
奥斯瓦尔德  坐吧
Oswald, sit.

411
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,110
坐下  奥斯瓦尔德
Sit, Oswald.

412
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,150
你好
Hello.

413
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,180
我是布鲁斯・韦恩
I'm Bruce Wayne.

414
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,250
芭芭拉・基恩
Barbara Kean.

415
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,540
塞琳娜没提过她和你一起住
Selina never said you're who she's staying with.

416
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,470
戈登警探提到过你
Detective Gordon spoke of you.

417
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,480
塞琳娜有时候戒心很强
Well, Selina can be a little guarded.

418
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,130
是啊  我知道
Yes, I know.

419
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,050
别再议论我了
Stop talking about me.

420
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,700
塞琳娜
Selina.

421
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,710
你看起来很漂亮
You look very nice.

422
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,420
这鞋真疼
The shoes hurt.

423
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,090
玩得开心
Have fun.

424
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,630
到舞会上找我
Look for me at the ball.

425
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,250
很高兴认识你
It was nice meeting you.

426
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,150
你觉得她在这儿吗
Think she's here?

427
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,000
范・格鲁特女士
Miss Van Groot!

428
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,690
哥谭市警局
GCPD!

429
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:21,500
我得说  这不太合法
I need to say this is not exactly legal.

430
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,890
我们没时间了
We're running out of time.

431
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,980
这边
Over here.

432
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:43,930
他没事
He's good.

433
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,040
叫支援  我去搜查房子其它地方
Call it in. I'm gonna go check the rest of the house.

434
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,550
他告诉我了...
He told me...

435
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,280
但是我太慢了
but I was too slow.

436
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,970
有人吗
Hello?

437
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,180
范・格鲁特女士
Miss Van Groot?

438
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,340
我是一名警官
I'm a police officer.

439
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,360
范・格鲁特女士
Miss Van Groot?

440
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,490
戈登
Gordon!

441
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,260
吉姆
Jim!

442
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,860
吉姆・戈登
Jim Gordon,

443
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,450
这位是康斯坦丝・范・格鲁特
Constance Van Groot.

444
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,700
所有人都在盯着我们
Everyone's staring at us.

445
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,070
我是布鲁斯・韦恩嘛
Well, I am Bruce Wayne.

446
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,830
我就是嘛
Well, I am.

447
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,830
话说  我没看到邦德斯洛
Anyway, I don't see Bunderslaw anywhere.

448
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,550
也许他不会来了
He's probably not coming.

449
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,170
但是他在宾客名单上
But he's on the guest list.

450
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,560
继续跳舞就是了
Just keep dancing.

451
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,120
或许可以笑一笑
And smile, maybe?

452
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,260
名叫雅各布・斯科林斯基
Name's Jacob Skolimski.

453
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,980
他什么都不说  不过我们知道
He's not talking, but near as we can tell

454
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,410
他曾是老妇人的管家
he was the old lady's butler.

455
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,170
你觉得食人魔是这人的儿子
And you're thinking the Ogre's this guy's son,

456
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,300
而不是死掉的女人的吗
not the dead woman's?

457
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,910
是的  验尸官说老妇人死了好多年了
Yeah, yeah. Coroner said the old bird's been dead for years.

458
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,890
我猜  食人魔杀了她  爸爸假装她还活着
My guess, Ogre killed her, daddy pretends she's still alive,

459
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,900
这样疯子连环杀手儿子可以继续花她的钱
so crazy serial killer son can keep living off her money.

460
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,420
他企图自杀
He tried to kill himself.

461
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,650
他知道你们要找到他了
He knew you were closing in.

462
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,110
-他肯定是跟儿子有联络的  -是啊
- He has to be in contact with his son. - Yeah.

463
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,380
戈登对这事很在意  警监
Listen, Gordon's running pretty hot on this one, Cap.

464
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,290
能怪他吗
Can you blame him?

465
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,280
他认为汤普金斯会是下个目标
Thinks Thompkins is the next victim.

466
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,400
不管怎样  盯着他点
Still, watch him.

467
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,200
阿尔瓦雷斯打来了
Alvarez called.

468
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,380
系统里查不到他儿子的资料
Nothing on the son in the system.

469
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,260
得撬开他的嘴
We have to make him talk.

470
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,250
别折腾了
Make this simple.

471
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,280
说出你儿子的名字和住址
Give us your son's name and address.

472
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,810
否则呢
Or what?

473
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,850
我不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

474
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,230
那是因为你不了解我
Only because you don't know me.

475
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,260
听着  我理解你想保护儿子
Listen, I get wanting to protect your son,

476
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,840
但还要等他杀掉多少女人
but how many more women is he gonna have to kill

477
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,560
你才会明白  他该被关起来
before you realize he needs to be locked up?

478
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,180
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

479
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,130
别跟我装傻  你在楼上
Don't play dumb with me. You were hiding

480
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,970
藏一具烂尸体藏了那么多年
a rotting corpse upstairs for years,

481
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,880
还非要坚持你儿子是天使吗
but no, no, my son's an angel,

482
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,050
还非要说他没杀
he didn't murder close to

483
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,680
近12个女人吗  这还是我们知道的
a dozen women that we know of.

484
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,830
我儿子
My son--

485
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,730
他犯了一个错误
he made one mistake.

486
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,890
就一个
One.

487
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,410
其他的都是谎言
Anything else is lies.

488
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,110
那说实情听听
So tell us the truth.

489
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,130
塞琳娜  昨晚的事
Selina, what happened last night--

490
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,890
那绝不能再发生了
that can never happen again.

491
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,440
我说了  我当时别无选择
I told you I didn't have a choice.

492
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,660
这我不接受
I don't accept that.

493
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,440
我就知道你会受不了
I knew you wouldn't be able to handle it.

494
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,300
你说得对  我当时是想杀他
You're right. I did want to kill him.

495
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,480
小点声
Keep your voice down.

496
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,190
但有道界线  塞琳娜
But there's a line, Selina.

497
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,160
你可以说我是胆小  但事实就是
And you can say I don't have guts, but the fact is

498
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,940
我绝不会跨过那道线
I will never cross it.

499
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,080
那这就是我们的不同了
I guess that's where we're different, then.

500
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,150
因为如果我还要再做一次  我也会做的
'Cause if I had to do it again, I would.

501
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,100
而且我丝毫不会介意
And it wouldn't bother me one bit.

502
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,860
那是邦德斯洛
That's Bunderslaw.

503
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,200
谜语哥
Riddle Man.

504
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,860
多尔蒂警官  能说句话吗
Officer Dougherty, a word.

505
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,540
我可以挑起或终结战争
I can start a war or end one.

506
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,830
我可以给你力量  让你成为英雄
I can give you the strength of heroes

507
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,350
也可以让你无力
or leave you powerless.

508
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,620
只要一瞥  就能诱走我
I might be snared with a glance,

509
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,700
但却没什么能逼我驻留
but no force can compel me to stay.

510
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,520
我是什么
What am I?

511
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,900
猜不到
Got me.

512
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,350
是爱
Love.

513
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,890
柯林格小姐给了你她的爱
Miss Kringle has given hers to you.

514
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,660
而你却回以伤害
And in return, you hurt her.

515
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
我看到了她的伤痕
I saw the bruises.

516
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,670
怎么了
And?

517
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,810
你不能那么做
And you cannot do that.

518
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,190
你下次再这样  我就...
The next time you do that, I'll...

519
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,420
冷静
Calm down.

520
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,810
别抽过去了
You'll give yourself a girly fit.

521
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,810
你跟女人处过吗
Have you ever been with a woman?

522
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,480
我猜就是
Didn't think so.

523
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,890
她们就需要管教
They need a firm hand.

524
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,240
尤其是柯林格
That goes double for Kringle.

525
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,600
那丫头嘴巴挺厉害
Girl's got a tongue.

526
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,670
我不会允许你伤害她的
I won't let you hurt her.

527
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,720
是吗
Oh, yeah?

528
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,020
你能怎么样
What are you gonna do?

529
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,740
我猜到了
That's what I thought.

530
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,050
回见了  谜语哥
Later, Riddle Man.

531
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,860
愿意跳支舞吗
Care to dance?

532
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,030
-你啊  -是啊
- You. - Me.

533
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,260
小孩子不该在这种地方长大
It was not a place for a boy to grow up.

534
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,040
范・格鲁特女士过着与世隔绝的生活
Miss van Groot kept herself sealed off from the world,

535
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,270
但她十分宠爱我儿子
but she doted on my son.

536
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,000
视如己出
Treated him as her own.

537
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,830
但是
Still, I...

538
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,170
我并不知道他们的感情多深
I didn't realize how deep it went.

539
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,660
这孩子的亲生母亲不在身边
This kid's own mom was out of the picture,

540
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,650
所以他开始认为
so it seems he started thinking

541
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,970
他其实是这位范・格鲁特女士的私生子
he was this van Groot woman's secret son.

542
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,570
我想跟他解释事情不是那样的
I tried to tell him it wasn't true,

543
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:05,900
但他构造了一个幻想
but he had built this fantasy, and...

544
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,770
范・格鲁特女士也怂恿了这种想法
Miss van Groot led him on.

545
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,010
她是个疯女人
She was deranged.

546
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,090
甚至很残忍
Cruel, even.

547
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,130
于是大概十年前  他找她对质
So, about ten years ago, he confronts her,

548
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,910
要求她认他
he demands that she acknowledge him,

549
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,560
让他用她的姓氏  把他写进遗嘱
give him her last name, put him in the will.

550
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,660
她嘲笑了他
She laughs at him,

551
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,150
说那都是个玩笑
said it was all just a big joke.

552
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,590
于是他就杀了她
So he kills her.

553
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,040
他父亲觉得愧疚  就帮他掩盖
His dad feels guilty, helps him cover it up.

554
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,800
老妇人拒绝了他
So the old woman rejects him,

555
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,750
他就杀了她  从此成了连环杀手
he kills her-- bang, you got a serial killer

556
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,660
一心纠结于母亲的拒绝
with a "mommy didn't love me" complex.

557
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,760
但还有个转折
But there's a wrinkle.

558
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,040
我不知道我儿子在哪
I don't know where my son is.

559
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,600
他今天打给了我  说警察会找上门
He called me today, told me the police would be coming.

560
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,560
但自从他杀了
But I haven't seen him

561
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,130
范・格鲁特女士  我就再没见过他了
since the day he killed Miss van Groot.

562
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,600
我儿子不是个坏人
My son is not a bad man.

563
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,920
你儿子这十年来一直在勾引
Your son has been seducing and killing women

564
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,370
并杀害女人
for almost a decade.

565
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,820
他笑什么
Why is he laughing?

566
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,490
我儿子
My son...

567
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,320
勾引女人
seducing women?

568
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,370
我给你看看我儿子吧  两张照片
Oh, let me show you my son-- two pictures.

569
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,170
我就保存下这点
It's all I managed to save.

570
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,480
听说过"只有亲娘才会爱的脸"吗
You've heard "a face only a mother could love"?

571
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,230
他的亲娘却不爱他
Well... his mother couldn't.

572
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:17,110
他一出生她就抛下了我们
She left us after he was born.

573
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:20,620
是啊  我儿子  还引诱女人呢
Oh, yes... my son, the seducer.

574
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,640
所以也怪不得
Now you can see why it makes sense

575
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,790
他把照片里的自己都刮掉了
he scratched his face out of those pictures.

576
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,130
但这样他就不可能是食人魔了
But that means this can't be the Ogre.

577
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,640
我们找错人了
We're chasing the wrong guy.

578
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,850
吉姆有个想法
Jim had an idea.

579
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,480
哈克尼斯法官签的搜查证内容很具体
Judge Harkness's warrant was very specific.

580
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,830
我什么都不用说
I don't have to say anything.

581
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,090
那就点头
Then nod.

582
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,530
你是否给此人做过手术
Did you operate on this man?

583
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,940
我需要知道他如今的模样
I need to know what he looks like now.

584
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,470
否则他下一个杀的女人就怪你了
Or the next woman he kills will be on your head.

585
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,640
他从来
Never, never,

586
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,000
不肯跟其他孩子玩
would he play with the other children.

587
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,080
就是那时候
You know, even then,

588
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,080
他也是鹤立鸡群
he was too good for them.

589
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:20,060
如今  他是令人尊敬的商人
And now, he is a respectable man of business--

590
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,120
我的奥斯瓦尔德
my Oswald.

591
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,940
嗯
Well...

592
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,650
今晚真是愉快
this has been a delight.

593
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:26,820
但已经很晚了
But it's late.

594
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:28,300
有件事
One thing...

595
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,600
格特鲁德  亲爱的
Gertrud, my love.

596
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,790
有个问题一直在困扰我
A question that's been bothering me.

597
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,310
不不  真糟糕
Oh, no. Oh... no, no.

598
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,020
你是在演戏吗
Is this an act?

599
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,330
你是在假装他只是个夜店老板吗
Are you pretending that he's just a nightclub owner?

600
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,570
还是说你真就那么傻
Or are you really that stupid?

601
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,430
住口
Stop!

602
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,160
我不明白
I don't understand. I...

603
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,450
-你儿子  -马罗尼阁下  我警告你
- Your son... - Don Maroni, I am warning you!

604
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,330
是个冷血疯子
is a cold-blooded psychopath.

605
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,020
不不
No, no, no, no, no...

606
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,570
我都数不过来他杀了多少人了
I can't count how many men he's killed.

607
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,970
我的好朋友  弗兰基・卡彭
My own friend, Frankie Carbone,

608
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,770
被他捅了十几刀
he stabbed him a dozen times.

609
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,160
什么样的人会拿刀
What kind of person plunges a knife

610
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,240
一遍遍捅人啊
into someone over and over?

611
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,370
他是个臭骗子  母亲
He is a filthy liar, Mother!

612
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,400
他就是气我耍了他
He's just angry because I played him for a fool!

613
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:13,750
奥斯瓦尔德
Oswald...

614
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,450
你知道的吧
You know, don't you?

615
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,960
我看得出来
Oh, I can see it.

616
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,330
放开她
Let go of her!

617
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,480
你是不是哪天晚上
Did you catch him, one night,

618
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,260
碰见他洗掉手上的血迹了
washing the blood from his hands?

619
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,670
你是什么时候意识到  自己生了个禽兽的
When did you realize that you had given birth to a monster?

620
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,630
你会为此付出代价的
You are going to pay for this!

621
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,080
或许吧
Maybe.

622
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,440
也或许  结局会是
Or maybe this ends with

623
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,950
我把你了无生气的尸体丢进河里
me dumping your lifeless body into the river.

624
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,870
不管怎样  你和你妈都可以别再装了
Either way, you and Momma Gertrud can stop pretending.

625
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,990
这地方看上去不错
Place is looking good.

626
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,220
那天晚上  你看到我的请帖时
The other night, when you saw my invitation,

627
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,000
为什么不告诉我你也要来
why didn't you tell me you were coming?

628
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,960
我当时没要来
I wasn't.

629
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,900
我并没受到邀请
I didn't get invited.

630
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,790
那么你是不请自来喽
Oh, so you're crashing.

631
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:11,220
不是  我在宾客名单上的
Oh, no, I'm... on the list.

632
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,060
一万元的捐款能做到很多事呢
It's amazing what a $10,000 donation will do.

633
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,390
你为这场舞会捐了一万元
You donated $10,000 to this?

634
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,310
为什么
Why?

635
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,050
我还希望我的目的不言自明呢
I was hoping that would be apparent.

636
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,660
如果我不来了呢
And what if I decided not to come?

637
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,740
那我就为慈善事业慷慨解了囊
Well, then, I'd have been making a generous donation to charity,

638
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,680
但也会很失望
and I would've been very... disappointed.

639
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,480
昨晚弄成那样
The way things ended last night,

640
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,350
都怪我
it was my fault.

641
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,960
但我对你有种感觉
But I felt something.

642
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,100
我不能就那么放手
I couldn't let it slip away.

643
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,660
这话很动听  但是
Well, that's very sweet, but...

644
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,970
你说  人们如果看清了真实的你
You said that when people see the real you,

645
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,320
就会尖叫着逃跑
they run screaming.

646
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,620
也有人曾这么说我
Someone said the same thing to me once,

647
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,240
说没人会爱我
that no one would ever love me.

648
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,150
谁
Who?

649
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,870
我把她视作母亲的人
The woman I thought was my mother.

650
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,390
芭芭拉
Barbara...

651
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,920
我知道那种感觉
I know what it's like...

652
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,650
内心是一个人
to be one person on the inside,

653
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,280
世界却看到另一副面目
and have the world see another.

654
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,980
我曾那样生活
I lived like that.

655
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,110
这差点摧毁了我
And it almost destroyed me.

656
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,830
我看得出  这在摧毁你
I can see it destroying you.

657
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,160
我不想再跳了
I don't want to dance anymore.

658
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,190
如今的我  是我自己创造的
The person that I am now, I created.

659
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,630
他是我打造出来的
I brought him into being.

660
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,520
我也可以帮你重生
I can do the same for you.

661
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,010
你难道不厌倦伪装吗
Aren't you tired of playing games?

662
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,590
还有隐藏
Of hiding?

663
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,310
是啊
Yes.

664
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,590
-再见  -回头见
- Good-bye. - See you soon.

665
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,380
你好  我是布鲁斯・韦恩
Hello. I'm Bruce Wayne.

666
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,540
希德・邦德斯洛
Sid Bunderslaw.

667
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,550
我在到处走动
I'm going around,

668
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,910
想认识一下所有公司的人
trying to get to know everybody who works for the company.

669
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,460
你是韦恩集团的人吧
You do work for Wayne Enterprises, don't you?

670
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,540
是的
I do.

671
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,900
我是操作部主管
I'm the Director of Physical Operations.

672
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,560
恐怕这工作是很无聊的
Which, I'm afraid, is a bit dull.

673
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,500
这里有很多比我有趣得多的人呢
There are many much more interesting people here.

674
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,790
嗯  我肯定能把大家都认识一遍的
Ah, yes, well, I'm sure I'll get to meet everyone, eventually.

675
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,680
失陪了  布鲁斯
If you'll forgive me, Bruce,

676
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,980
我明早还有很早的航班要赶
I have an early flight tomorrow.

677
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,050
认识你很高兴
It's been a pleasure.

678
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,430
是啊
It was, um...

679
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,090
认识你很高兴
it was nice meeting you.

680
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,570
抱歉
Sorry.

681
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,570
瞧见没
See?

682
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,700
轻而易举
Nothin' to it.

683
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,030
怎么了
What is it?

684
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,000
没什么
Nothing.

685
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,510
站住  混蛋
Stop right there, buster!

686
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,460
谜语哥
Riddle Man?

687
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,200
你偷偷摸摸在这里干什么呢
What the hell are you doing, creeping around here?

688
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,770
你得离开柯林格小姐
You need to leave Miss Kringle alone.

689
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:43,770
什么
What?!

690
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,680
我不会允许你伤害她的
I'm not gonna let you hurt her.

691
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,030
再也不行了
Ever again.

692
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,330
我认为你该离开哥谭
I think you need to leave Gotham...

693
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,040
就今晚
tonight.

694
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,640
我明白了
I get it now.

695
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,620
你是喜欢上我女人了
You got a thing for my girl.

696
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,630
太有意思了
That's too funny.

697
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,560
别往心里去
Don't take this personal.

698
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,690
还想再挨吗
You want some more?

699
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,530
起来吧
Upsi-daisy...

700
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,380
天呐
Oh, dear.

701
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,200
谜语哥
Riddle Man...

702
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,100
天呐
Oh, dear.

703
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,420
天呐
Oh, dear.

704
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,750
不
Oh, no.

705
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,860
天呐
Oh, dear.

706
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,460
天呐
Oh, dear.

707
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,670
天呐
Oh, dear...

708
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,950
奥斯瓦尔德
Oswald.

709
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,930
好点了吗
Feeling better?

710
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,590
我泡了茶
I made tea.

711
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,250
恐怕你
I'm afraid you had...

712
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,410
是...
well...

713
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,770
喝多了
a little too much to drink.

714
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,840
马罗尼先生  他...
Mr. Maroni, he...

715
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,730
他的幽默感很特别
he has a strange sense of humor...

716
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:33,950
奥斯瓦尔德
Oswald...

717
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,420
我不是乡下来的土包子
I am not some bumpkin from the country,

718
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,750
脑子里装的也不是稻草
with hay in my brains!

719
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:40,540
当然
No...

720
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,940
我是你母亲
I am your mother...

721
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,070
不管怎样  我都会爱你
and I will love you, no matter what.

722
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,690
但你现在对我撒谎
But lie to me now...

723
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,150
你会伤透我的心
you will break my heart.

724
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,870
奥斯瓦尔德
Oswald...

725
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,360
你有没有做过
have you done things...

726
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,020
你不该做的事
you should not?

727
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,550
我
I...

728
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,820
母亲
Mother...

729
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,580
我是个夜店老板
I'm a nightclub owner.

730
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,180
仅此而已
That's all.

731
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,930
我累了
I'm tired now.

732
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,590
我累了
I'm tired.

733
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,070
给格特鲁德的花  萨尔送的
Yeah, I got a delivery for Gertrud, from Sal.

734
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,380
没给小费
Tip's not included.

735
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,240
告诉萨尔  都结束了
You tell Sal it's over.

736
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,590
枪已经买好
The guns are bought.

737
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,710
杀戮室在等着他
The killing room is waiting.

738
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,800
他还不自知  但他死定了
He doesn't know it, but he's a dead man.

739
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,120
算了
On second thought...

740
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,840
我还是亲自告诉他吧
I'll tell him myself.

741
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:31,610
奥斯瓦尔德
O-Oswald?

742
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,570
是谁啊
Who was that?

743
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,280
是隔壁的雅斯科先生
It's Mr. Yatsko, from next door.

744
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,300
他需要人帮他倒垃圾
He needs help taking out some trash.

745
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,130
那你帮帮他啊
You, you... please, you help him, then.

746
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,050
杰森・范・格鲁特
Jason van Groot?

747
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,100
他本名是杰森・斯科林斯基
His real name is Jason Skolimski.

748
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,970
他去诊所时用的是老妇人的姓氏
He used the old woman's name when he went to the clinic.

749
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:58,530
但按两个姓氏在哥谭都查不到人
But there's no Jason van Groot or Skolimski in Gotham.

750
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,760
这人就是个鬼魂
The guy's a ghost.

751
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,610
那老妇人拒绝了他  他去找医生
So, the old woman rejects him, he goes to the doctor,

752
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,060
给自己整了张俊脸
gets himself a pretty new face.

753
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,900
在那儿遇到了护士
That's where he runs into the nurse.

754
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,630
开始了疯狂杀人
And we're off to the races.

755
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,190
你们拿到照片了吗
I don't suppose you got a picture.

756
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,850
档案里的丢了  毫不奇怪
Missing from the file. No surprise there.

757
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,560
但好心的医生给我们做了画像
But the good doctor was kind enough to do a sketch.

758
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,620
他已经十年没见过他了
It's been ten years since he last saw him,

759
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,900
但这多少是个开始
but at least it's a start.

760
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,040
我们知道他的真名
So we have his real name,

761
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,570
却不知道他在用什么假名
but not what alias he's using,

762
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:23,630
除了张时隔十年的画像  也不知道他的样子
or what he looks like beyond a decade-old sketch.

763
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,510
他今天打电话来时说过什么吗
Did he say anything else on the phone today?

764
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,500
任何我们可能漏掉的
Anything we might've missed?

765
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,810
没有  他就是警告我放弃
Nah, just warned me to back off.

766
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,340
叫我别信了报上对我的吹捧
Told me not to believe my own press

767
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,760
说我是哥谭市警局的崛起新星
as the rising star of the GCPD.

768
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,140
怎么了
What is it?

769
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:42,040
说这话的报纸
The paper that said that--

770
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,520
刊登了一张我在慈善晚会上的老照片
they ran an old photo of me, from a charity gala.

771
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,380
我跟人的合照
I wasn't alone.

772
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,800
芭芭拉
Barbara!

773
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,490
芭芭拉在吗
Is Barbara here?

774
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,560
不在  怎么了
No. Why?

775
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,260
她人呢
Where is she?

776
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,090
你最后见到她是什么时候
