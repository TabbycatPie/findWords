1
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:02,892
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,894 --> 00:00:06,607
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:09,675
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:12,712
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:16,248
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,350
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,587
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,991
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:28,094
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:29,895
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:32,632
How many more terrible things
are you gonna do to protect me?

12
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:34,366
That's my job. That's all that matters.

13
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,201
It's my turn to go out on my own.

14
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,469
Don't come looking for me.

15
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:38,971
Everything seems to be telling me

16
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:40,840
that Barry and I are
meant to be together.

17
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:42,407
Somebody please help!

18
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,874
There's only one person
who can help you now.

19
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,236
YOUR SPEED FOR WALLY

20
00:00:46,237 --> 00:00:47,737
The Flash.

21
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:50,282
Barry, I know you can't give
up your speed to that monster.

22
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,450
That's not your decision.

23
00:00:51,452 --> 00:00:53,352
Hand him over and it's yours.

24
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:56,355
- He's slowing down.
- He's becoming human again.

25
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:01,260
I know some piece of
you did care for me.

26
00:01:01,262 --> 00:01:03,095
Please let him go.

27
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:07,332
Caitlin!

28
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,237
It's a regular day in Central City.

29
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,806
Nothing out of the ordinary.

30
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,943
People wake up.

31
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,579
Roll out of bed.

32
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,514
Suit up for the day.

33
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:25,517
Get to work as fast as they can.

34
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:28,963
Make sure they get a
caffeine fix along the way

35
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,912
so they can make it through the
mountain of work that awaits them.

36
00:02:07,762 --> 00:02:10,262
Yup, it's just a regular day.

37
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,499
And I'm just a regular guy.

39
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:25,377
I really wish we didn't have
to keep Jay's helmet around.

40
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,546
- I hate this thing.
- Well...

41
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,015
Just want to put a dent in it.

42
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:33,452
Cisco, did you see Caitlin in your vibe?

43
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,555
Zoom's got her in his lair.

44
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,457
She's scared, but she's okay.

45
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,859
Oh, thank God.

46
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,227
All right, we need to get her back.

47
00:02:41,814 --> 00:02:42,694
I know.

48
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,529
But without your speed,
there's no way any of us

49
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,932
can get through that breach that
Cisco found at the hospital.

50
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:49,101
I just don't think there's
anything we can do right now.

51
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:50,469
He's right.

52
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,837
And it's thanks to you, Al.

53
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,372
Enough. We're all suffering here.

54
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,040
That's right. That's right, Detective.

55
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:56,608
We're all suffering. We've lost Snow,

56
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,377
you've lost your speed, and now...

57
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,882
now Zoom can come through
that breach anytime he wants.

58
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:05,084
And that, Allen...

59
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,652
that's on you.

60
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:08,053
Hey, that's on all of us, okay?

61
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,323
We made these decisions as a team.

62
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:15,795
No we didn't.

63
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:17,997
Where are you going?

64
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:19,665
I'm gonna go find Jesse

65
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,934
before Zoom does... again.

66
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,602
Wait, you found her? How?

67
00:03:23,604 --> 00:03:26,238
Cellular dead zones, remote...

68
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,910
people from my Earth vibrate at a different
frequency than people from your Earth.

69
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:32,411
They leave cellular dead
zones wherever they go.

70
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,479
That's why I'm always
dropping calls around you?

71
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,282
Okay, so... so wait, how did that help?

72
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:40,519
I track the dead zones created
by Jesse since she got here

73
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:41,553
and I follow the trail.

74
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,156
It's easy.

75
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,361
What, so you think you're gonna need that
gun to convince her to leave with you?

76
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,830
You're full of questions
today, aren't you, West?

77
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,364
The gun is not for my daughter.

78
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,668
She's not the only person from a
different Earth, hiding out on this one.

79
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:58,470
If I run into them, I'm gonna need this.

80
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:01,506
Okay, but you're also
gonna need some help.

81
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,475
Really?

82
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:06,278
You know anyone with the
speed to help me, Ramon?

83
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,218
Great. I'll be in my workshop.

84
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,188
Don't listen to Wells, Barry.

85
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,091
This ain't all on you.

86
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,994
Yeah, I know.

87
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,462
You need a ride back to the station?

88
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,696
No, I'm good.

89
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,365
I'm gonna stick around, actually.

90
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,433
Finished all my cases this morning.

91
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,402
Damn, that was fast.

92
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,937
That was a poor choice of words.

93
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,273
You do know it's okay to ease back into

94
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,975
the way you used to do things, right?

95
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:39,578
Well, this is the only
way I can fight crime.

96
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,615
If I'm not The Flash,
that's what I got to do.

97
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,639
You need to eat.

98
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,611
Caitlin.

99
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:16,882
If you want to speak to me,
then take off that mask.

100
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,519
Does this make you feel better?

101
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:24,489
Nothing you could ever do
would make me feel better.

102
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,192
You don't need to be afraid.

103
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,994
I'm not gonna hurt you.

104
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,198
I care too much about you to do that.

105
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,069
You only care about yourself...

106
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,570
Hunter.

107
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,571
Hunter.

108
00:05:40,942 --> 00:05:42,507
You're gonna want to see this, son.

109
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,976
No!

110
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:47,046
I know you think that I'm a monster.

111
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:48,513
I understand why.

112
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,219
But that'll change.

113
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:59,791
- Please, Cait...
- Do not call me that.

114
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,293
Why are you keeping me here?

115
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,561
You're cured.

116
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:03,996
You don't need me for anything.

117
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:07,699
You're here because I love you.

118
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,871
It may take a while, but
someday, you'll start

119
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,907
feeling that way about me again, too.

120
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,448
Make yourself at home.

121
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,682
You're gonna be here a while.

122
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:26,452
Okay?

123
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,691
I-I don't understand.

124
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:11,596
Well, hello, doppelganger of mine.

125
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,565
What do you know?

126
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,268
I can still pull off brunette.

127
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:20,448
CENTRAL CITY POLICE

128
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,008
Dad.

129
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,444
Oh, hey, son. What a surprise.

130
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,089
What's up?

131
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,081
I wanted to ask you about something.

132
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:31,417
Someone, actually.

133
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,086
The Flash.

134
00:07:34,088 --> 00:07:36,021
What about him?

135
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:40,059
Well, he showed up at my street
race when Iris got hurt.

136
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:43,595
Then, when that man-shark
thing attacked our house.

137
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,298
And when Zoom took me, he said,

138
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,968
"Someone The Flash knew cared about me""

139
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,406
Yeah, it doesn't take a genius
to figure out that that's you.

140
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:56,975
You want me to tell you who he is?

141
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:57,876
I can't do that.

142
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,711
No, I know. I know.

143
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:02,281
I was actually hoping that you
could set up a meeting for me.

144
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:05,417
A meeting? Between you and him?

145
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,152
I... I don't know if I can
do that either, Wally.

146
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,887
Well, why not?

147
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,921
Joe?

148
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:11,256
Singh wants to see you.

149
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:13,492
Okay.

150
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:18,263
Look, maybe one day,
but, I mean, not now.

151
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,499
I got to get to work.

152
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,800
See you at home?

153
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,302
All right.

154
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,281
The laser tag club's in 2D.

155
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,217
The...? Oh, no.

156
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:40,952
I'm looking for Jesse.

157
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,455
Come on in.

158
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,958
Thanks.

159
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,428
Jesse!

160
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,897
You're, like, the first person
who's ever come to visit her.

161
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,902
- What?
- How'd you find me?

162
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,304
Jess...

163
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,640
Cellular dead zone.

164
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,708
I told you, I'd find
you wherever you went.

165
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,678
Wait, so you're a runaway?

166
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,647
So you're her dad?

167
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,483
Great, let me know if I need
to find a new roommate.

168
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:17,389
Listen.

169
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,890
We need to go.

170
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,492
So, what?

171
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,761
You think I'll be safer with you?

172
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:27,299
Yes.

173
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,833
Yeah, I think I'm gonna pass.

174
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,035
Jesse.

175
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,538
We need to leave.

176
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,972
No, okay?

177
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,074
No, I'm not going anywhere
with you ever again.

178
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,710
You are...

179
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,879
you are in danger.

180
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,681
Do you understand? You
are in grave danger.

181
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:43,882
I know!

182
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:46,084
I'm in danger because of you.

183
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,420
- Because of me?
- Yeah!

184
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,889
Okay, everything that's
happened, it's your fault.

185
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,924
Zoom hunting us, the metas...

186
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,426
moving here.

187
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,661
I'm done with it.

188
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,196
Okay, you wanted me to start a new life,

189
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,030
and that is exactly
what I'm trying to do.

190
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,701
- No, Jess... Jess...
- You killed a man!

191
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:06,338
I can't just forgive you for that.

192
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,873
And I may be afraid of Zoom, but...

193
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,610
but I am just as afraid of you.

194
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,845
Please, just... just go.

195
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:57,604
CRIME RATE CLIMBS HIGHER

196
00:10:57,605 --> 00:11:00,556
And a new report shows that petty
crimes have risen slightly this month,

197
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:02,890
sparking concerns that The Flash...

198
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:04,589
Don't watch that.

199
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:08,150
Cisco, everybody's gonna realize sooner
or later that I don't have my speed.

200
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:10,032
The later the better. The
last thing we need is

201
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:13,499
every criminal in the city thinking
they're untouchable, right?

202
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,499
What is that?

203
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:15,834
Case in point.

204
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:17,669
What?

205
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:18,803
What is that?

206
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,506
It's Harry.

207
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:22,974
What about Harry?

208
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,843
The camera in the lab van
recorded an accident.

209
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:26,778
See, this is my version of crash assist.

210
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,880
It's like those Russian
dash cams, but, you know,

211
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:32,617
without attack helicopters and
bad pop music on the radio.

212
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:42,326
That does not look like an accident.

213
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:45,229
First Caitlin's taken, now Wells.

214
00:11:49,153 --> 00:11:50,468
- CRASH ASSIST ACTIVATED
- This is where he got taken,

215
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,277
but there aren't any
traffic cams in that area.

216
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,909
I'm gonna head out there,
see what I can find.

217
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,075
I'll analyze this footage and see
if we can figure out who this is.

218
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,475
All right.

219
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:59,678
Wait, what was the last
place the van stopped?

220
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,579
Woodmen and Shore for about 15 minutes

221
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:02,981
before heading back to Central City.

222
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,716
- Why?
- That's where Jesse must be.

223
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:07,719
She should know if something's
happened to her dad.

224
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:08,820
Iris, hey.

225
00:12:08,822 --> 00:12:11,156
I need your help with something.

226
00:12:11,158 --> 00:12:14,059
You're... Killer Frost.

227
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:16,394
And you're Caitlin Snow.

228
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:19,864
Your little friend, Cisco,
wouldn't shut up about you.

229
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:22,734
Made you out to be some kind of a saint.

230
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:26,037
So tell me, why hide the girls?

231
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,940
I mean, you've seen our body, right?

232
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:34,012
If I could get my powers to
work through this carbine wall,

233
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:37,982
the first thing I would
do is shut him up!

234
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:39,084
Who is he?

235
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:41,285
Don't know, don't care.

236
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:43,788
But if he's here, Zoom must need

237
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,692
something from him.

238
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:50,128
So what does Zoom need you for?

239
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,798
That is an excellent question, Caity.

240
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,334
You know, I've been asking
myself the same thing.

241
00:12:56,336 --> 00:12:59,437
But doesn't matter now.

242
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:02,406
I'm not gonna stick around much longer.

243
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:05,778
Wait, I... I thought you said your
powers don't work inside this cell?

244
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,246
They don't. You're right.

245
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,882
So you're gonna help me get out of here.

246
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:12,717
Why would I help you?

247
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,585
Listen, honey, there's no way you are

248
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:17,655
making it down that
cliff all by yourself.

249
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,924
So let's make a deal.

250
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:23,494
You get me out of this box,

251
00:13:23,496 --> 00:13:25,429
and I'll help you get home.

252
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:29,801
Might even throw in some
wardrobe tips for free.

253
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:33,138
So what do you say, Caitlin?

254
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,873
Do we have a deal?

255
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:47,351
I don't understand.

256
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:49,654
There's nothing around here.

257
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,323
What did the van hit?

258
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:53,958
I don't know.

259
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:58,764
Something strong enough to exert an
equal amount of force back on the van.

260
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:05,069
Someone was definitely here, though.

261
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:08,006
You think maybe a meta-human?

262
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,008
Yeah.

263
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,210
And if it's a meta that's after Wells...

264
00:14:12,212 --> 00:14:14,245
Then they could be from Earth-2.

265
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:16,347
Probably.

266
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:17,982
We got to get Jesse.

267
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:19,583
Find Wells. Fast.

268
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,878
Dr. Harrison Wells.

269
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,981
Yup. And who are you?

270
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:52,416
Name's Griffin Grey.

271
00:14:52,418 --> 00:14:55,086
Griffin Grey?

272
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:56,520
Do I know you?

273
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:59,257
Nope. But you should.

274
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,026
I'm one of your mistakes.

275
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:06,030
One of your sins coming home to roost.

276
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:08,132
All right, you think I...

277
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:09,633
I'm from...

278
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,435
I'm not... I'm not who you think I am.

279
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:14,505
I know exactly who you are.

280
00:15:14,507 --> 00:15:19,077
And you're gonna fix what your
particle accelerator did to me.

281
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:20,912
What did the accelerator do to you?

282
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,260
That.

283
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,661
Well, that's impressive.

284
00:15:37,663 --> 00:15:39,697
And all things considered,
I don't know that having

285
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:42,667
that kind of strength is the worst
thing you could have been given.

286
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:45,503
Yeah, that's what I thought at first.

287
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:48,773
And it was a lot of fun.

288
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:51,976
Till I learned it did
something else to me, too.

289
00:15:53,513 --> 00:15:56,080
That's me.

290
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:58,016
Last year.

291
00:15:58,018 --> 00:16:00,318
You're...

292
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,986
you're ageing.

293
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:05,723
If this keeps happening, I'll
be dead in a few months.

294
00:16:05,725 --> 00:16:07,926
How old are you, Griffin?

295
00:16:10,596 --> 00:16:12,463
I'm 18.

296
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:19,770
Look.

297
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:22,907
I'm sorry this is happening to you.

298
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,576
But there's nothing I can do to fix it.

299
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:28,279
Well, that sucks.

300
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:31,682
'Cause if you can't figure out
a way to help me, Dr. Wells...

301
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:35,320
You're gonna die soon, too.

302
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,147
I never should have left.

303
00:16:46,148 --> 00:16:48,182
No, this isn't your fault.

304
00:16:48,184 --> 00:16:49,517
Do we know what took him?

305
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,118
That's where things get interesting.

306
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,721
That fingerprint that
you guys brought in,

307
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:54,922
the one from the van, I mean.

308
00:16:54,924 --> 00:16:56,790
Yeah, yeah.

309
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:59,793
Belongs to this guy.

310
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:01,128
Griffin Grey.

311
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,163
A senior at Central City High School?

312
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,032
No, wait, I've seen this
kid's picture before.

313
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,734
He went missing, like, six months ago.

314
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:07,935
That's right.

315
00:17:07,937 --> 00:17:09,303
That doesn't make any sense.

316
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:10,771
An 18-year-old didn't kidnap Wells.

317
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:12,072
That's what I thought at first,

318
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,741
but feast your eyes on this.

319
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:21,738
It's the same guy.

320
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:23,083
Yeah, the blood sample confirms it.

321
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,218
How is that even possible?

322
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,886
I'm not sure yet.

323
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:28,962
Without Caitlin here, I can't
really analyze the cells

324
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:30,558
on a molecular level to see
what we're dealing with here.

325
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,326
You know, I might
actually be able to help.

326
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,761
How?

327
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:35,396
Bio-chem was one of
my majors in college.

328
00:17:35,398 --> 00:17:36,397
One of your majors?

329
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:37,431
How many did you have?

330
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,933
Five.

331
00:17:39,935 --> 00:17:41,502
What, is that not common here?

332
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:43,671
Girl, no, that is not common anywhere.

333
00:17:43,673 --> 00:17:45,273
All right, let's search for that Grey,

334
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,774
see what we come up with.

335
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:48,609
I'll see if facial
recognition brings him up

336
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:51,078
and I'll have Joe check CCPD's database.

337
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,713
Cool.

338
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:54,582
See what you can do.

339
00:17:59,188 --> 00:18:00,788
I'm going as fast as I can.

340
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,590
Well, you better go faster.

341
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:04,358
Zoom will be back any minute.

342
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,294
I could just leave you
in there, you know.

343
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,333
But you want to go home so badly.

344
00:18:12,335 --> 00:18:15,068
So how did this happen to you?

345
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,407
Woke up one day, cold, pale.

346
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:21,442
Thought I was sick.

347
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:25,245
Turns out it was
something else entirely.

348
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:26,847
You got hit by the dark matter from

349
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,382
the particle accelerator explosion?

350
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:29,750
Yes.

351
00:18:29,752 --> 00:18:33,854
Right after I flunked out of med school.

352
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:36,524
Had to move back in with my mother.

353
00:18:36,526 --> 00:18:38,326
That couldn't have been fun.

354
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,894
If she's anything like mine, I mean.

355
00:18:40,896 --> 00:18:42,095
Why?

356
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:44,965
Is yours a frigid narcnasist, too?

357
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:46,233
Cold as ice.

358
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:47,735
Yeah.

359
00:18:47,737 --> 00:18:50,771
Mom was like that ever
since Charlie died.

360
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:52,373
Who's Charlie?

361
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,541
My brother.

362
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:56,210
- I never had a brother.
- No?

363
00:18:56,212 --> 00:19:00,381
Then why was Mom such a
bitch on your Earth?

364
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:02,383
Honestly, I couldn't say.

365
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,420
So...

366
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:10,491
how is this going to get me out of here?

367
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:13,427
The electrical current in
the cable should heat up

368
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:17,097
the carbine, which in turn
should speed up the electrons

369
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:18,499
and the faster they go...

370
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,602
The weaker its molecular
structure becomes.

371
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:23,937
Exactly.

372
00:19:23,939 --> 00:19:27,174
I studied every once in a while.

373
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:30,277
Well, when it gets hot enough,
it should make the carbine

374
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:32,212
as fragile as glass.

375
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:35,516
And then we can both get out of here.

376
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:48,028
- Wally.
- Hey, Joe.

377
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,530
What's up?

378
00:19:49,532 --> 00:19:51,965
You look like you got
something on your mind.

379
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,335
Yeah, I do.

380
00:19:55,337 --> 00:19:57,605
Please don't tell me you
drove all the way over here

381
00:19:57,607 --> 00:20:00,274
to ask about The Flash again.

382
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:01,975
It's...

383
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:03,811
it's not happening, Wally.

384
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:06,313
But... it's just one time.
That's all I'm asking.

385
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:08,015
It's impossible.

386
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:10,551
He saved my life, Joe.

387
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:13,721
I owe him a thank you.

388
00:20:16,058 --> 00:20:18,459
Look.

389
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:22,530
I've been reckless my whole life.

390
00:20:22,532 --> 00:20:25,599
Racing cars, pushing limits.

391
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,668
I did everything at full speed
without a care in the world.

392
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:35,074
But it wasn't until Zoom took me that...

393
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:38,244
that I really thought I was gonna die.

394
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:40,713
And I was going to die,

395
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:44,717
if The Flash didn't do what he did.

396
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:48,121
He gave up his powers to save me.

397
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,723
A guy he didn't even know.

398
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:53,492
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

399
00:20:56,164 --> 00:20:59,598
I need to tell him how
much that means to me.

400
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:06,906
Well, all right.

401
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:11,744
Just give me a little while.

402
00:21:11,746 --> 00:21:14,080
I'll see what I can do.

403
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:17,683
I got to go.

404
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:28,461
Hey, Dad.

405
00:21:28,463 --> 00:21:30,063
Thanks.

406
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:40,439
- Yo!
- In here.

407
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:41,707
I got your text. What's up?

408
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,243
All right, facial recognition

409
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:46,613
just picked up Grey breaking into
Ace Chemical down on Newbury Road.

410
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:48,348
- Is my dad with him?
- I don't know yet.

411
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,649
- But we have to go.
- You sure about that?

412
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,585
Yeah, I'm sure. Look...
we can't just sit here.

413
00:21:52,587 --> 00:21:54,320
Regardless of whether I
have my speed or not,

414
00:21:54,322 --> 00:21:56,256
I have to try to help.
That's never gonna change.

415
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,592
Okay. I'm with you, but we're
gonna need some backup.

416
00:21:59,594 --> 00:22:01,060
- Joe's on his way.
- I'm coming with.

417
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:02,728
No, look, please just stay here.

418
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,397
We don't know what we're
dealing with yet.

419
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,432
Just finish running the
test on the blood sample.

420
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:08,935
I'm sorry. Thank you, Jesse.

421
00:22:25,189 --> 00:22:29,499
-T-U-(SUB)-TITU-LO-.-CO.-M

422
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,493
Griffin Grey, CCPD!

423
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:36,495
Stay right there.

424
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:39,933
The man that you
kidnapped, Harrison Wells,

425
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:41,301
you need to let him go.

426
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:43,669
I can't do that. Not yet.

427
00:22:43,671 --> 00:22:45,271
Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

428
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,206
I guess so.

429
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:57,216
Okay, He-Man's got some power.

430
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:02,488
And accuracy.

431
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,023
All right, keep him distracted, okay?

432
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:05,084
What?

433
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,061
Barry! Barry!

434
00:23:07,062 --> 00:23:08,794
I can do this all night.

435
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:12,865
We just want Wells. Just let him go.

436
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,867
Not until I'm done with him!

437
00:23:31,552 --> 00:23:34,020
Too slow.

438
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:46,499
- Barry!
- Hey.

439
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:48,334
Oh, I think I need some
medical attention.

440
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:58,071
So his genes have actually mutated.

441
00:23:58,073 --> 00:24:00,274
I ran the DNA from the
blood sample Barry found,

442
00:24:00,276 --> 00:24:04,511
and the functional myostatin in
his cells is essentially gone.

443
00:24:04,513 --> 00:24:06,313
I mean, giving him super-strength.

444
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:07,648
Guys, there's something else.

445
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:10,317
I saw him age.

446
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,685
Right in front of me.

447
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:14,921
He's suffering from oxidated stress.

448
00:24:14,923 --> 00:24:18,826
It means the protein in the DNA in
his body are being ravaged by oxidants.

449
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:21,295
So, what, he needs to up
his blueberry intake?

450
00:24:22,765 --> 00:24:26,099
No, it means... the
more he exerts himself,

451
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:28,201
the faster he ages.

452
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:31,405
So if we can get him to
exert too much energy...

453
00:24:31,407 --> 00:24:33,340
Then he'll become old and weak.

454
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:35,942
And how do you think
we're gonna do that?

455
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:39,947
I can't watch you be a human punching
bag until he turns into Grandpa Simpson.

456
00:24:39,948 --> 00:24:41,948
I think we can fix that.

457
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,018
Jesse, I'm gonna need some of
that quick thinking of yours.

458
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,987
Iris.

459
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:49,989
I got to get back to the station.

460
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,032
You okay?

461
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:04,904
No, not really.

462
00:25:04,906 --> 00:25:08,100
You know, you were the first
person I saved after I got my powers?

463
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,848
We were out on a walk

464
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,183
and we were talking about Eddie

465
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:20,754
and how you were with him,
and I was thinking to myself

466
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:25,291
how I missed a lot while
I was in that coma.

467
00:25:25,293 --> 00:25:29,095
And then all of a sudden,
those cars came at us.

468
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:32,165
And it was like the world froze.

469
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:35,779
Like... you and I were the only
two people in the world.

470
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,973
I didn't even know what I could do yet,

471
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:43,176
but I knew that I could save you.

472
00:25:43,178 --> 00:25:45,746
And I did.

473
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:47,881
And now, I don't know.

474
00:25:47,883 --> 00:25:49,282
I don't...

475
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:52,919
I just don't even know who I am anymore

476
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:54,688
or who I'm supposed to be.

477
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,436
Barry, you're supposed to be the
same guy that you've always been.

478
00:26:02,698 --> 00:26:06,032
Suit or no suit...

479
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:08,334
that guy is a hero.

480
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:16,042
That's everything you asked for.

481
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:18,412
How do you sleep at night?

482
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:22,115
Knowing you've destroyed
so many people's lives?

483
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:24,284
I don't.

484
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:29,890
Do you have anyone in your
life that you care about?

485
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:32,125
I have a daughter.

486
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:35,395
I used to have someone in
my life that I cared about.

487
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:40,467
My girlfriend, Jenny.

488
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:44,070
We were gonna get married,
have kids someday.

489
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:53,080
But after I got hit by that wave
from the particle accelerator,

490
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:55,281
all my dreams ended.

491
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:58,384
You know, I see her sometimes,
walking down the street.

492
00:26:58,386 --> 00:27:00,320
She doesn't even recognize me.

493
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:01,888
But why would she?

494
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,190
I look as old as her dad.

495
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,161
- You robbed me of her.
- Griffin.

496
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:09,796
Stop talking.

497
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,264
So I can concentrate.

498
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:13,032
Wake up, man.

499
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:16,670
This city is screwed up because of you.

500
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:20,106
It was quiet and normal.

501
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,975
Until you rode in on your high horse,

502
00:27:21,977 --> 00:27:25,011
talking about science and
changing the future.

503
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:28,414
You didn't stop to think about
what your particle accelerator

504
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:30,484
could do to others. You
only thought about

505
00:27:30,486 --> 00:27:31,818
what it could do for you.

506
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,487
Enough!

507
00:27:36,057 --> 00:27:37,423
Enough.

508
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:39,993
I hope it was worth it.

509
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:41,695
Doc.

510
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:50,069
Stay away from the wall.

511
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:52,405
Let's give it a whirl.

512
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,082
The Flash visits T=U=SUB(T.ITU)LO.(C.O.M)

513
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,831
Well...

514
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:21,167
looks like you have a little
badass in you, after all.

515
00:28:27,142 --> 00:28:29,609
What are we gonna do about this guy?

516
00:28:29,611 --> 00:28:31,144
Oh, Caity.

517
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:34,180
I don't think he's ever going home.

518
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:36,215
And neither are you.

519
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:40,587
What are you doing? I
thought we had a deal.

520
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:44,390
Is everyone on your Earth this gullible?

521
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,003
Heels aren't the best on ice, are they?

522
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:58,438
You know, once I saw you,

523
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,875
I realized why Zoom didn't kill me.

524
00:29:01,877 --> 00:29:05,211
Because I look just like you.

525
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:08,014
Now he won't need me anymore.

526
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:25,298
No.

527
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,166
I don't.

528
00:29:33,141 --> 00:29:35,308
Try that with him...

529
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,977
he dies, too.

530
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:45,752
Not picking up anything
from facial recognition.

531
00:29:45,754 --> 00:29:48,588
The only cellular dead zone I
can find is the one in here.

532
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,256
No offense.

533
00:29:50,258 --> 00:29:53,293
No, wait a second, was he wearing
his watch when he left to get me?

534
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:54,861
Already tried that. GPS isn't working.

535
00:29:54,863 --> 00:29:57,230
Okay, no, but the meta-human
activity would be.

536
00:29:57,232 --> 00:29:59,298
I mean, the watch is designed
to track metas, right?

537
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,668
And since Griffin Grey is one,
it'll keep sending a message

538
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,169
to a server till it goes through.

539
00:30:03,171 --> 00:30:06,040
But since we're on a different
Earth, it'll never go through.

540
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:08,536
So it just keeps sending
the same signal.

541
00:30:08,537 --> 00:30:10,177
DEVICE LOCATION

542
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:11,878
There he is, Central
City Amusement Park.

543
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,579
Yeah, and I'm coming with this time.

544
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:15,015
Okay, great, we've found Harry,

545
00:30:15,017 --> 00:30:16,415
but how are we gonna stop Grey?

546
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,284
I'm so glad that you asked.

547
00:30:18,286 --> 00:30:21,354
Jesse and I upgraded the
internal lining of the suit.

548
00:30:21,356 --> 00:30:24,057
Felicity hooked us up with
some dwarfstar alloy.

549
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,458
Wait, dwarfstar alloy?

550
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,195
It's the same compound that's used
to protect Ray's A.T.O.M. suit.

551
00:30:28,196 --> 00:30:29,362
That's right.

552
00:30:29,364 --> 00:30:31,264
Super strong, super lightweight.

553
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:33,432
Only thing is, we
couldn't get much of it.

554
00:30:33,434 --> 00:30:35,401
All right, what does that mean?

555
00:30:35,403 --> 00:30:39,540
We could only cover the
chest portion of the suit.

556
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:40,674
Yeah, sorry.

557
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:41,721
Here's the other thing...

558
00:30:41,722 --> 00:30:44,811
probably not a big deal...
I'm guessing the suit

559
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:47,280
will only absorb one of Grey's punches.

560
00:30:47,282 --> 00:30:48,648
Anything more than that,

561
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,249
you'll be like a piñata.

562
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:51,450
Only it won't be candy
coming out, it'll be...

563
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:53,519
- Me.
- You're... yeah, you.

564
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:54,954
Yeah.

565
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:56,455
All right.

566
00:30:56,457 --> 00:31:00,026
Hopefully, one gimme
punch is all I'll need.

567
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:11,127
Finished.

568
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:16,532
This is gonna cure me?

569
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:20,503
As we say in science, I'm
cautiously optimistic.

570
00:31:23,608 --> 00:31:25,241
You know, I learned a
lot about chemistry

571
00:31:25,243 --> 00:31:27,243
in the past two years.

572
00:31:27,245 --> 00:31:29,445
Is that right?

573
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:32,448
And I know all you've been doing
is diluting that compound

574
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,019
for the past half hour.

575
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:37,620
You don't know how to help me, do you?

576
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:43,960
There is no helping you.

577
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:49,565
I told you you were gonna
fix me or you were dead!

578
00:32:05,086 --> 00:32:11,354
Created by (TuSub)(Titulo).(co)m

579
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:15,192
Why is it that bad guys always insist
on having the creepiest hideouts?

580
00:32:15,193 --> 00:32:17,160
'Cause they crazy.

581
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:18,127
Right.

582
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,265
Hey, Barry.

583
00:32:22,267 --> 00:32:24,067
Grey's headed your way.

584
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:25,101
Come on. Hey, come on.

585
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:33,609
You ready?

586
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:35,245
Okay, Iris.

587
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,413
On my mark.

588
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:38,748
Three...

589
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,616
two...

590
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:41,584
one.

591
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,119
Now!

592
00:32:48,826 --> 00:32:50,159
That all you got, Flash?

593
00:32:50,161 --> 00:32:51,327
I just want Dr. Wells.

594
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:52,962
And I wanted him to fix me.

595
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:54,330
But he can't.

596
00:32:54,332 --> 00:32:57,200
So once I finish you,
I'm gonna finish him.

597
00:32:57,202 --> 00:32:58,167
Freeze!

598
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:12,382
Come on!

599
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:21,690
Okay.

600
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:23,726
I think one more punch, and
we get this guy a walker.

601
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:25,028
Hey, guys, we got him.

602
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,362
He's over by the Ferris Wheel.

603
00:33:31,502 --> 00:33:33,303
Look.

604
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:34,437
We can help you.

605
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:37,340
It's too late for that.

606
00:33:37,342 --> 00:33:41,144
Not everyone got the
powers you did, Flash.

607
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,112
Some of us weren't so lucky.

608
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:53,056
That was the gimme.

609
00:33:53,058 --> 00:33:54,723
Griffin.

610
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:57,060
Please stop.

611
00:33:57,062 --> 00:33:59,429
I might be getting older,

612
00:33:59,431 --> 00:34:01,697
but I'm stronger than ever.

613
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,812
Barry!

614
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:29,425
You okay?

615
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:30,826
Yeah, I'm good.

616
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:33,396
Could've used more of
that dwarfstar alloy.

617
00:35:11,436 --> 00:35:14,870
I'm so sorry.

618
00:35:14,872 --> 00:35:16,639
I'm sorry, too.

619
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:38,320
Home sweet home.

620
00:35:38,322 --> 00:35:40,189
Yeah, well...

621
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:43,160
to be honest, it hasn't felt
much like a home in a while.

622
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:45,910
At least, certainly not since you left.

623
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,577
Yeah.

624
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:51,949
Look, I'm sorry, Dad, for
just leaving like that.

625
00:35:51,951 --> 00:35:53,383
But...

626
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,751
I mean, you have to understand,

627
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:59,056
I'm the reason you killed that man.

628
00:35:59,058 --> 00:36:02,993
And that's a really
heavy burden to bear.

629
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,997
I know.

630
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:11,568
I know... I also know
that what I've done,

631
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,902
it's unforgivable.

632
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:24,681
When you're mother died, honey...

633
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,951
something inside me broke.

634
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,887
I couldn't protect her.

635
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:34,691
And I swore... I swore
on her grave, no less,

636
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,060
that I would protect you,
and then Zoom took you,

637
00:36:37,062 --> 00:36:39,997
and I snapped.

638
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:42,265
I just snapped.

639
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:45,502
I couldn't breathe, I...

640
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:49,373
I couldn't lose the only other person

641
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,391
that I love.

642
00:36:51,392 --> 00:36:54,726
Yeah. Yeah, I get that.

643
00:36:54,728 --> 00:36:57,429
I understand why you did everything

644
00:36:57,431 --> 00:36:59,531
you did to protect me.

645
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:01,366
I mean, you were only missing one day,

646
00:37:01,368 --> 00:37:04,469
and I would have done
anything to find you.

647
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,873
But, I mean...

648
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,742
I need to know that that's
never gonna happen again.

649
00:37:10,744 --> 00:37:12,210
Okay?

650
00:37:12,212 --> 00:37:14,746
Every time I stay out
late or get in trouble,

651
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:17,382
you can't track me down or hurt someone

652
00:37:17,384 --> 00:37:18,817
'cause you're trying to save me.

653
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,519
Yeah, but you're in danger.

654
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:22,454
- I know.
- Okay.

655
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:29,928
I will make you a promise.

656
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:35,301
I promise you, I will be the kind
of father that you will be proud of.

657
00:37:35,302 --> 00:37:39,638
If you promise me you will
never run away from me again.

658
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:41,840
Okay.

659
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,143
Okay, deal.

660
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:46,545
I love you, Dad.

661
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:48,647
I love you, too.

662
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:52,884
My little Jesse Quick.

663
00:37:58,024 --> 00:38:00,992
Relax, he'll be here.

664
00:38:00,994 --> 00:38:02,360
What should I say?

665
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:04,329
I don't even know where to start.

666
00:38:04,331 --> 00:38:06,030
Just be honest.

667
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:07,833
Speak from your heart.

668
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:09,300
Okay.

669
00:38:09,302 --> 00:38:12,303
Wally West.

670
00:38:12,305 --> 00:38:13,872
I'll see you at home.

671
00:38:15,642 --> 00:38:16,875
You wanted to see me.

672
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,443
Yes. I did.

673
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:20,378
I mean, I... I do.

674
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:27,418
I just wanted to thank
you for saving my life.

675
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:32,390
And I know that that came
at a huge price for you.

676
00:38:32,392 --> 00:38:37,261
And I don't know how
I'll ever repay that.

677
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:41,833
I guess, what I wanted
to say was that...

678
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:43,535
I'm not gonna waste this chance

679
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:46,505
that you've given me.

680
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:50,575
Thank you.

681
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:52,544
You're welcome, Wally.

682
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:14,032
You okay?

683
00:39:14,034 --> 00:39:17,468
Stay away from me.

684
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,839
Killer Frost tried to kill you, Caitlin.

685
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:24,475
I saved your life.

686
00:39:24,477 --> 00:39:25,944
You should thank me.

687
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,746
I just want to go home.

688
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:29,681
No.

689
00:39:29,683 --> 00:39:33,484
Stay.

690
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:35,453
I want to leave!

691
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,589
Stay, boy!

692
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:39,490
No!

693
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:43,428
Please.

694
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,730
Take me back to my Earth.

695
00:39:48,835 --> 00:39:50,936
You know...

696
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,537
I've always measured my success

697
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:55,574
by counting the number
of victims I've had.

698
00:39:55,576 --> 00:40:00,511
But now I think I'm going
to widen my scope.

699
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:04,783
Start counting the number of
Earths I conquer, instead.

700
00:40:06,252 --> 00:40:08,186
You want to go home?

701
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:10,188
Let's go.

702
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,057
After all, this Earth has already

703
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:13,992
been brought to its knees.

704
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:23,155
-IS NOT OVER YET-

705
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:36,547
You're here early.

706
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:37,849
Yeah.

707
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:40,785
- I couldn't sleep.
- Me neither.

708
00:40:40,787 --> 00:40:46,491
I know that we just took down
Grey without my powers, but...

709
00:40:46,493 --> 00:40:49,961
I have no idea how to get
Caitlin back without them.

710
00:40:49,963 --> 00:40:52,597
We can't, Allen.

711
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:55,500
Then what are we gonna do?

712
00:40:57,604 --> 00:40:59,804
You know, Grey...

713
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:03,975
Grey kidnapped me because

714
00:41:03,977 --> 00:41:08,446
he thought I was the Harrison
Wells from this Earth,

715
00:41:08,448 --> 00:41:10,682
and I know he was talking
about another guy,

716
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:13,118
but I just...

717
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,721
I can't help but think...

718
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:19,658
I still haven't paid for what I've done.

719
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,959
What does that mean?

720
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:27,866
I thought, you know, when you...

721
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:30,568
when we closed the breaches,

722
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,738
I could just forget about
everything I've done,

723
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,741
but I can't.

724
00:41:36,743 --> 00:41:40,111
I realize what I can do.

725
00:41:42,615 --> 00:41:45,349
You are gonna get your
speed back, Allen.

726
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:49,220
And I'm gonna help you do that.

727
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:50,855
How?

728
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:56,294
By creating another particle
accelerator explosion.
