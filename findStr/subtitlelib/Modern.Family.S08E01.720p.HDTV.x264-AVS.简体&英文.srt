00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,380
我们真的得走吗
Do we really have to leave?

43
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,680
是啊  我们不能再多待几天吗
Yeah, can't we just stay a couple more days?

44
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,680
我知道  我也很难受
I know -- it's killing me.

45
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,590
明天是阿波罗剧院的开麦之夜
Tomorrow's open-mic night at the Apollo.

46
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,050
我们还会再回来  我也喜欢这里
Look, we'll all come back. I love it here, too.

47
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,900
跟纽约人相比  我很放松
Compared to New Yorkers, I'm laid-back.

48
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,040
来抱抱
Now, come on.

49
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,850
上楼收拾行李  不然你们可能赶不上飞机
Get upstairs and pack, or else you might miss your flight.

50
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,100
在纽约度过美好的一周后
After a great week in New York,

51
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,270
我得去罗利参加卡罗来纳州橱柜大会
I had to get to Raleigh for the Carolina Closet Caucus.

52
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,530
菲尔和我一直都想
Phil and I have always wanted

53
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,880
一起开车周游全国
to drive across the country together,

54
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,470
所以我们想来个自驾游
so we thought we'd make a road trip of it.

55
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,630
-再见  孩子们  -再见
- Bye! Bye, guys! - Bye! Bye! Bye!

56
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,790
我们会想你们的
We'll miss you!

57
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,350
就这样决定了  我们再住一晚
Okay, here's the deal -- We're staying another night.

58
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,080
什么
What?

59
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,790
你听到爸妈说的话了  他们说不行
You heard mom and dad. They said no.

60
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,340
我们还是会在他们之前到家  他们不会知道
Well, we'll still get home before them. They'll never know.

61
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,870
拜托  安迪和我刚分手
Oh, come on. Andy and I just broke up.

62
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,110
我还没准备好回去面对生活
I'm not ready to go back and face life.

63
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,860
我们要怎么付房费啊
Come on, how would we even pay for the hotel?

64
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,070
我们可以用卢克的园游会赔偿金
We can use Luke's carnival settlement money.

65
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,810
不行  那是我赚的
No way! I earned that.

66
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,240
摔下游乐设施的是我
I'm the one who fell off that ride.

67
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,720
受罪的其实是我们
We were the ones who really suffered.

68
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,600
在你的头消肿之前  我们都不能开灯
We couldn't turn on lights or make loud noises

69
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,060
或者发出很大的声音
until your head got small again.

70
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,070
我们不能用那笔钱  那是给我上大学用的
We can't use that money. It's for college.

71
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,770
好啦  好啦  花了吧
Okay, okay, let's spend it.

72
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,900
瞧瞧  我们一直没去成的寿司餐厅
Oh, look -- that sushi restaurant we never made it to.

73
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,320
是啊  我们努力过了
Oh, yeah. We tried.

74
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,500
可是他们没有五人桌
They just never had a table for five.

75
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,210
但这一趟我们玩得很开心  对吧
We had a lot of fun, though, didn't we?

76
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,670
-是啊  -是啊
- Yes, we did. - Yeah.

77
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,180
可惜的就是
Never got to get on 

78
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,790
没有乘坐到中央公园游园马车
one of those horse-drawn carriages through the park.

79
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,130
艾丽克斯过敏
Alex's allergies.

80
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,560
都不知道原来还能单对马车皮革过敏
Didn't know you could be allergic to carriage leather.

81
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,730
但这依然是一段很棒的家庭时光
Still, just so much good family time.

82
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,810
家庭时光
Family time.

83
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,220
你的想法跟我一样吗
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

84
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,130
你可以不去开会
You could blow off the convention.

85
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,930
我们可以待在这里  度过浪漫的几天
We could stay here for a romantic few days

86
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,800
但别告诉孩子们  因为我们刚逼他们回家了
but never tell the kids because we just made them go home?

87
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,540
没错
Yes!

88
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,210
这是你第一次答对这个问题
That is the first time you've ever answered that question right.

89
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,000
我不要今天死
Not today!

90
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,800
小卡  外面天气真好
Oh! Cam, it is so beautiful outside.

91
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,590
你得...
You got to --

92
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,870
好吧
Ohhhh...right.

93
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,440
我们决定去密苏里州度过夏天
We decided to spend the summer in Missouri.

94
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,760
但我们过来后发现小卡的奶奶躺在临终床上
But we arrived to find Cam's grandma on her deathbed.

95
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,250
从感恩节到现在完全没变
Right where we left her at Thanksgiving.

96
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,000
我希望你能多体谅
Hey, um, I wish you'd be a little more mindful

97
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,260
我的家庭情况
of my family situation.

98
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,440
抱歉  我没意识到祈祷
I'm sorry -- I didn't realize the vigil

99
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,390
转移到了公用区域
had drifted out to the common areas.

100
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,780
小卡  拜托  
Cam, come on. 

101
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,770
她都95岁了  靠设备维持生命
She's 95 years old and plugged into a wall.

102
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,130
也许是时候...
Maybe it's time to, you know...

103
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,640
什么  你什么意思  米奇尔
What? What are you saying, Mitchell?

104
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,910
我们该停了设备吗
That we should pull the plug?

105
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,140
愿上帝怜悯你
Lord o' mercy.

106
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,770
你有轮班去陪过奶奶吗
Have you even taken your turn sitting with Gram?

107
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,130
没有  她才不想要我陪  她恨我
No, she doesn't want me there. She hates me.

108
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,120
又来了
This again.

109
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,410
小卡  她称我为"那娘炮"
Cam, she refers to me as "the sissy."

110
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,420
你听错了
You heard that wrong.

111
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,790
因为她继承的假牙  我们很难听懂她的话
She's hard to understand because of the dentures she inherited.

112
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,170
你知道那假牙是儿童钢琴的琴键做的
You know they were made from the keys of a child's piano.

113
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,080
而且对昏迷的人能说什么啊
What do you even say to someone in a coma?

114
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,710
妈妈读着她的诗
Well, Mama's reading her poetry.

115
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,820
莉莉朗诵《圣经》
Lily's reciting scripture.

116
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,020
小帕和我打算唱我们小时候改编的歌
Pam and I are gonna sing a song we wrote when we were younger,

117
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,200
《甜蜜之家阿拉奶奶》
"Sweet Home Ala-gramma."

118
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,440
{\an8}原曲是知名歌曲《甜蜜家乡阿拉巴马》

119
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,440
好  教我唱吧
Okay, yeah, t-teach me that.

120
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,230
抱歉  她是你的阿拉奶奶吗
Oh, I'm sorry -- Is she your Ala-gramma?

121
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,000
好吧  我会想想的
Oh, fine. I'll think of something.

122
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,210
* 前进... *
* Onward -- *

123
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,990
抱歉
Sorry.

124
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,670
这衣领好痒
This collar itches.

125
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,500
别挠了  你们看起来都很帅
Stop it. You all look so handsome.

126
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,130
我们看起来像是三剑客
We look like The Three Amigos.

127
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,100
我们在华雷斯
We were in Juarez

128
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,430
参加我19岁的可爱表妹玛丽索的第三次婚礼
for my sweet 19-year-old cousin Marisol's third wedding.

129
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,050
真是太美了
It was so beautiful.

130
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,620
谢天谢地他们按时挖通了地道
Thank God that they finished that tunnel in time

131
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,370
她爸爸才能及时偷渡赶到
for her father to make it.

132
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,740
杰  别玩手机了  你错过了一切
Ay, Jay, stop with the phone. You're missing everything.

133
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,880
等等  我在为本周末的父亲节
Hang on -- I'm trying to lock up some sausages

134
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,240
订一些香肠
for Father's Day this weekend.

135
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,760
要是等到最后才订  
You wait till the last minute, you wind up eating

136
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,340
就只能跟嬉皮士一样  吃鸡肉苹果味香肠了
chicken and apple, like some damn hippie.

137
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,110
双击
Double click!

138
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,420
那妖妇  曼尼  跟我来跳舞
La Diabla. Manny, come dance with me.

139

你好  杰
Hola, Jay.

141
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,150
桑娅
Oh, hey...Sonia.

142
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,060
我看见歌洛莉亚躲着我了
I see Gloria's avoiding me.

143
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,140
她还在生气我转发给她了那封群发邮件
She's still mad because I forwarded her that mass e-mail.

144
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,360
也许吧  也可能是上次你们见面时
Could be that, or it could be the last time you saw her,

145
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,980
你想抢走我  再杀了她
you tried to steal me and kill her.

146
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,300
我姐姐怎么样
So, how is my sister?

147
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,710
很好啊  好极了
Fantastic. Great.

148
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,490
当然了  有了乔和她的辣酱生意
'Course, with Joe and also her hot-sauce business,

149
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,640
她可有得忙的
she got a lot on her plate.

150
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,960
你吃过这种墨西哥曲奇吗
Hey, have you tried one of these Mexican cookies?

151
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,080
我们称呼它为曲奇而已
They just call them cookies.

152
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,180
我一会儿要跟歌洛莉亚谈谈
I'll speak with Gloria later.

153
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,810
我得先把这个放到礼物桌上
I have to drop this at the gift table.

154
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,310
太好了
Great.

155
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,430
我的座位发冷  花儿也都枯萎了
My seat is cold, and the flowers wilted.

156
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,320
看来我妹妹来过这里了
I see that my sister has been here.

157
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,280
你能放下那仇了吗
Will you get over that?

158
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,980
她刚刚很友好  我们聊了聊乔
She couldn't have been nicer. We talked about Joe.

159
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,570
我告诉她你的辣酱生意做得有多好
I told her how well your hot-sauce business was going.

160
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:24,530
对了  你吃过这种曲奇了吗
By the way, have you tried one of these cookies?

161
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,440
你干嘛告诉她辣酱的事
Why did you tell her about the sauce?

162
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,930
各位  拿上你们的东西
Everybody, get your things.

163
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,070
我们得马上离开华雷斯
We have to leave Juarez right now!

164
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,660
什么  我花了45分钟才穿上这身衣服
What?! It took me 45 minutes to get into this outfit!

165
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,150
你知道桑娅会有多神经病
You know how crazy Sonia can be.

166
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,760
现在她知道了
She's gonna be so jealous now that she knows

167
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,200
我是个非常成功的女商人  她会非常嫉妒的
that I am a very successful businesswoman.

168
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,970
那生意你不是还亏了400刀吗
Aren't you 400 bucks in the hole on that thing?

169
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,050
你不觉得这样不好吗
You don't think this looks bad --

170
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,620
晚餐开始前就离开这里
us walking out before dinner?

171
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,820
乔发烧了  他...他在大出汗呢
Joe has a fever, and he -- he's sweating very much.

172
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,900
没有  我才没有
No, I'm not.

173
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,510
我要收回我说的话
I'm gonna reverse what I said.

174
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,090
中央公园租狗生意  能大赚特赚的点子
Central Park dog rentals -- million-dollar idea.

175
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,930
对啊  而且可能度假让我嗨到糊涂了
Yeah, and maybe it's just the high of being on vacation,

176
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,940
但是还有比美洲旅鸽[已灭绝]更高贵的鸟吗
but is there a bird more majestic than the American pigeon?

177
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,650
穿衣服  我们出去吃早餐披萨
Get dressed. We're going out for walk-around breakfast pizza.

178
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,900
糟糕  忘拿钥匙了
Oh! Shoot. Forgot my room key.

179
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,440
我得给我爸拍一张这种镶板的照片
Oh! I've got to get a picture of this paneling for my dad.

180
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,190
芳香型雪松木刨花板  完全改变这个行业
Aromatic cedar flakeboard -- game a-changed.

181
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,800
我爱死我的性感小衣柜狂了
I love my sexy little closet nerd.

182
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,760
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

183
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,410
我去迅速泡个澡
I'm gonna take a quick tub.

184
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,060
我们得给孩子们打电话查查岗  假装"在路上"
We should check in with the kids from "the road."

185
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,600
对对对
Oh, right, right.

186
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,460
我们还得去帮酒搞点冰块来
We should also maybe get some ice for drinks.

187
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,950
我们去大堂等他吧  反正我得喝点咖啡
Let's wait for him in the lobby. I need coffee anyway.

188
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,550
隔壁房间的人做爱声大得我一晚上没睡
The people next door kept me up all night with their sex noises.

189
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,590
我听到了结尾部分
I caught the end of that.

190
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,000
那男的听着像个被吓到的鬼
He sounded like a scared ghost.

191
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,740
天啊  是老妈
Oh, my God. It's Mom.

192
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,950
保持冷静
Uh, well, stay calm.

193
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,740
就说我们在家  我们昨晚飞回来的
Uh, we're home, we flew in last night.

194
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,650
走吧  她肯定想跟卢克说话啊
Oh. Come on. She's gonna want to talk to Luke.

195
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,440
老妈
Hi, Mom.

196
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,610
亲爱的
Hi, sweetie.

197
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,280
从西弗吉尼亚给你打电话哦
I'm coming to you from West Virginia.

198
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,640
你们俩今天要做什么呀
What are you girls doing today?

199
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,290
我和艾丽克斯刚出来逛街
Oh, you know, me and Alex just out shopping.

200
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,250
你在跟谁打电话
Who are you talking to?

201
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,960
老爸  你在跟谁打电话
Dad. Who are you talking to?

202
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,760
-老妈  -老妈
- Mom. - Mom.

203
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,130
-俩闺女  -卢克
- The girls. - Luke.

204
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,230
等下
Hold on.

205
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,840
我告诉她们我们在西弗吉尼亚
I told them we were in West Virginia.

206
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,150
-你说什么  -肯塔基
- What did you say? - Kentucky.

207
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,110
老妈以为我们在逛街
Mom thinks we're shopping.

208
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,580
我跟老爸说我在给我们做早餐
I told Dad I was making us breakfast.

209
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,050
你什么时候给我们做过早餐了
When have you ever made us breakfast?!

210
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,740
好吧  姑娘们  我得走了
Okay, girls, um, I got to go.

211
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,430
-我们也是  开车注意安全哦  -拜
- Us too. Drive safely. - Bye.

212
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,570
哥们  我得走了
Hey, buddy, I should get going.

213
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,760
有个警察过来了
There's a cop walking towards us.

214
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,410
可能是因为我们停在州界线上怪怪的
I guess it looks weird with us parked right here

215
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,160
我前座在肯塔基境内
on the state border with me up here in Kentucky

216
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,670
-你妈后座在西弗吉尼亚境内  -知道了
- and your mom in the back seat over in West Virginia. - Got it.

217
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,180
我得把早餐打包好
I should probably finish packing up the breakfast

218
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,550
送到她们正在逛的商场去了
I'm bringing to the girls at the shopping mall where they're shopping.

219
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,900
-好吧  再见  -再见
- Okay. See ya, pal. - See ya.

220
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,600
-就是这么简单  -搞定
- That's how you do that. - Done.

221
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,890
* 甜蜜之家  阿拉奶奶 *
* Sweet home Ala-gramma *

222
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,060
* 双眼与头发都是美丽的蓝 *
* Eyes and hair of gorgeous blue *

223
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,100
我一会儿再回来
I'm gonna come back.

224
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,200
别别别  你来得正好
No, no, no. I'm glad you're up here.

225
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,330
-我们一会儿再唱  -对对对
- We can finish later. - Yeah, yeah.

226
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,770
她喜欢你抚着她头发  揉她的脚
She likes it when you stroke her hair and rub her feet.

227
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,540
米奇尔  你要确保她舌头是湿润的
And, Mitchell, make sure her tongue stays moist.

228
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,990
我要怎么...
How would I -- Ugh.

229
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,240
奶奶好
Hey, Grams.

230
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,420
昏...昏迷感觉怎么样
How's -- How's the coma?

231
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,440
我的天啊  天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

232
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,080
你想说什么吗
A-Are you trying to say something?

233
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,450
奶奶  很疼  放...放手
Grams. Ow, that hurts. Let -- let go.

234
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,370
奶奶  快放手
Grams, l-let go.

235
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,360
放手吧  奶奶  放手吧  奶奶
Let go, Grams. Let go, Grams!

236
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,270
你这是在跟她说什么鬼话
What the hell are you telling her?

237
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,850
怎么回事
What happened?!

238
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,000
我刚刚进来
I just walked in,

239
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,200
米奇尔在告诉她放手  她就真的"放手"了
and Mitchell was telling her to let go, and she did!

240
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,540
放手  我是说放手别抓我头发
Oh, let go -- let go of my hair.

241
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,560
打给马场的人  叫医生来
Somebody call the race track! Get the doctor!

242
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,750
-好多人来啊  -当然
Nice turnout. Sure is.

243
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,270
太奶奶在世看到这么多人在她土地会很生气
Grams would hate all these people on her property.

244
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,360
的确会
She sure would.

245
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,880
你好
Hi.

246
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,750
天啊  我觉得你的家人都虎视眈眈地瞪着我
Oh, my God. I can feel your family staring daggers at me.

247
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,100
真不敢相信他们觉得是我杀了奶奶
Can't believe they think I killed Grams.

248
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,990
说得好像我真的会叫她撒手人寰一样
Like I'd really be telling her to let go of life.

249
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,210
你把行李箱放进她房间
Well, you can see how they'd wonder

250
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,130
像准备要入住后  他们有这怀疑也正常
after you put your suitcase in her room.

251
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,730
你这么说是站在他们那边吗
It sounds like you're taking their side.

252
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,490
你不能怪他们质疑你所说的
You can't blame them for questioning your story

253
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,640
一名患关节炎并昏迷的女士揪你头发的故事
about a comatose arthritic woman pulling your hair.

254
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,580
这不是故事  这是真事
Not a story. A thing that happened.

255
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,710
-好吧  -好
- Fine. - Fine.

256
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,330
你把她爱看的电视剧
And you didn't help your case

257
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,070
意外洗掉了也更让人怀疑啊
by accidentally erasing her "Matlocks".

258
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,930
天啊  能"放下"了吗
Oh, my God! Just drop it!

259
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,930
不  不  我不是...
No, not -- not the... No. I -- I...

260
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,990
好吧  你们打算什么时候回来
Okay, so, when do you guys think you're gonna be back?

261
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,530
绝对会在父亲节到
Definitely by Father's Day.

262
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,160
好吧  我们想你们
Oh, okay. Well, we miss you guys.

263
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,540
不过也还剩三天呢
But at least it's still only three more days.

264
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,460
是不是有点太冒险
Was it a little risky?

265
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,850
只要出手的是专家就没问题
Not as long as the master did the talking.

266
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,260
我爱你们  再见
Aww. Love you both. Bye.

267
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,280
我们想你们
We miss you guys.

268
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,240
我得出去漆邮箱了
Got to run outside and paint the mailbox.

269
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,890
你只需要说句再见就好
All you had to do was say goodbye.

270
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,770
这下我们回家的时候还得漆邮箱
Now we have to paint the mailbox when we get home.

271
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,650
抱歉
Sorry.

272
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,760
我也是因为看到
It just popped into my head

273
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,680
自由女神像拿着油漆刷而情不自禁
when I saw the Statue of Liberty holding that paintbrush.

274
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,340
就是她为美国刷出自由的工具[是火把]
You know, what she used to paint freedom in America.

275
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,210
好吧
Yeah.

276
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,480
一个好谎的关键在于不节外生枝
The key to a good lie is keep it simple.

277
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,830
我一直夸它也没意义
Well, why don't I stop talking

278
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,560
不如直接给你带点尝尝吧
about how good it is here and just bring you some?

279
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,820
好吧  再见
Okay. Bye-bye.

280
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,010
我们得去买一块亚利桑那辣味羊奶酪
We need to pick up a wheel of Arizona spicy sheep cheese.

281
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,420
你就不能只说再见吗
Couldn't you just say goodbye?!

282
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,160
克莱尔  那上面写着"不要大声喧哗"
Claire, the sign says "No loud noises."

283
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,640
你会吓到魔术师大卫·布莱恩
You'll scare David Blaine.

284
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,150
所以  他就在果冻里坐了四天吗
So, he just sits in jello for four days?

285
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,750
我没懂这算哪门子魔术
I don't get how that's magic.

286
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,760
你不会懂的
You wouldn't.

287
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,720
我真希望爸爸也在这里
I wish Dad was here.

288
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,910
他肯定会超爱这个
He'd love this.

289
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,130
他不在  我们也不在这里
Well, he isn't, and neither are we.

290
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,600
还记得卢克以前把它叫成"果弄"吗
Remember how Luke used to call it "jeh-woh"?

291
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,370
真讨厌我不能跟他分享这一切
I hate that I can't share this with him.

292
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,430
魔术不是用来搞秘密与欺骗别人的
Magic isn't about secrets and tricking people.

293
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,060
菲尔  够了
Phil! Get it together.

294
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,490
跟你的男朋友大卫·布莱恩一样
Like your boyfriend, David Blaine,

295
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,930
我们得把这个秘密保守到死
we're taking how we did this to the grave.

296
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,110
我只是很遗憾他错过了这些
I just feel bad that he's missing out.

297
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,560
这是我跟他的专属爱好
This is our thing.

298
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,360
喂
Hey!

299
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,980
你永远不准告诉他这事
You will never tell him about this,

300
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,610
不然无照经营园游会没摔死的人  我们会亲手弄死
or we will finish what that unlicensed carnival started, okay?

301
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,460
我们打算飞回去过父亲节的那天早上
The morning we were set to fly back for Father's Day,

302
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,500
中西部地区的一场风暴导致航班取消
a storm in the midwest canceled our flight.

303
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,930
我们先去机场吧  肯定有航班的
Let's just get to the airport, and we will find a flight.

304
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:47,210
-出租车  -该死  被人抢了
- Taxi! - Damn it! It's already taken!

305
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,180
我好像买到了在丹佛转机的航班
Okay, so I think I got us on a flight through Denver.

306
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,240
你介意坐中间吗
Do you mind the middle seat?

307
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,250
能不摔就行啊
If it'll help.

308
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,970
不要什么事都扯上园游会的事好吗
This can't all be carnival-related.

309
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,230
出租车
Taxi!

310
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,460
出租车
Taxi!

311
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,850
杰  我本来打算来做香肠的
Ay, Jay, I was going to cook the sausage.

312
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,740
我不介意
Hey, I don't mind.

313
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,190
他决定接手应该是因为
He's taking over because we screwed up

314
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,520
我们搞砸了前几个父亲节
the last few Father's Days.

315
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,600
别说傻话  我来就行
Don't be silly. I got this.

316
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,230
我只要一想到前几个父亲节
When I think of the last few Father's Days,

317
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,610
就气得要炸
I quake with rage.

318
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,250
不介意的话可以多花点心思啊
Hey, maybe put a little thought into it.

319
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,400
比如不要叫披萨
Maybe we don't order the pizza.

320
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,400
真要叫的话
And if we do,

321
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,830
也许应该点够疯狂面包
maybe we get enough crazy bread for everybody.

322
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,910
抱歉  到底是谁把父亲节变成
I'm sorry, but who made Father's Day

323
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,830
{\an8}常用于配披萨的黄油蒜香芝士面包

324
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,290
节日界里的讨人厌拖油瓶啊
the dirty stepchild of holidays?!

325
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,910
父亲节连首歌都没有
We don't even have a song.

326
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,590
-爸爸  -怎么了
- Daddy? - What?

327
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,870
我给你准备了礼物
Got you a present.

328
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,840
不愧是我儿子
That's my boy!

329
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,190
让我们看看  你这里面放了什么
Let's see. What do we got in here?

330
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,520
一个冰桶
Hey. An ice bucket.

331
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,990
我看到曼尼拿走酒店的洗发水
I saw Manny take shampoos from the hotel.

332
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,640
所以我也拿了些东西
So I took some things, too.

333
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,160
然后是一些大件
Then some bigger things.

334
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,370
我喜欢偷东西
I like stealing.

335
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,720
这会让我心跳加快
It makes my heart go fast.

336
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,150
冰桶里有什么呢
And what's in the ice bucket?

337
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,950
一个吹风筒  谢谢  亲爱的
A hair dryer. Thanks, buddy.

338
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,540
谁这么早就来了
Who's here so early?

339
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,560
桑娅  你来这里干嘛
Sonia, what are you doing here?

340
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,290
你离开华雷斯太快了  我都来不及说再见
You left Juarez so fast, I didn't get to say goodbye.

341
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,450
我们是姐妹  我们不应该争吵
We're sisters. We shouldn't fight.

342
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,550
我想你
I miss you.

343
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
知道了
Okay, got it.

344
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,600
歌洛莉亚
Gloria!

345
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,180
桑娅  抱歉  快进来
Sonia. I'm sorry. Come in.

346
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,130
不行  我不能进
No, I couldn't.

347
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,820
不  你千里迢迢跑来
No, you came from so far away.

348
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,440
快进来  坐一会儿
Come on in. Stay awhile.

349
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,390
谢谢  杰
Thank you, Jay.

350
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,680
墨西哥曲奇
The Mexican cookies.

351
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,750
没想到能再看见它们
I never thought I'd see those again.

352
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,610
让我来帮你吧
Let me help you with those.

353
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,520
-桑娅阿姨  -你好  曼尼
- Hey, Aunt Sonia. - Hola, Manny.

354
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,410
我有一些行李在车上  来帮我吧
I have some luggage in the car. Come help me.

355
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,390
-好  -去帮你阿姨吧  去吧
- Okay. - Help your aunt. Go ahead.

356
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,360
你为什么要让她进来
Why did you let her in?

357
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,320
你得跟她聊聊
You have to talk to her.

358
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,030
我真的觉得她是来道歉的
I really think she's here to apologize.

359
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,850
你不像我那么了解她
You don't know her like I do.

360
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,340
等一下
Ohh! Wait!

361
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,650
你在干什么
What are you doing?!

362
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,660
好极了  杰  现在她绑架了曼尼
Great, Jay. Now she kidnapped Manny.

363
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,510
你怎么那么冷静
Why are you so calm?

364
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,300
我们不是应该跟着他们或者叫警察吗
Shouldn't we follow them or call the police?

365
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,820
不  不过是绑架而已  在我家这很正常
No, it's just a kidnapping. It's normal in my family.

366
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,150
绑架电话来了
Ransom call.

367
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,310
妈妈  我真的很害怕
Mom, I'm really scare--

368
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,140
她要我用辣酱生意来交换曼尼
She wants my hot-sauce business in exchange for Manny.

369
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,010
太好了  那她就欠我们400美金了
Good! Then she owes us 400 bucks.

370
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,300
而且孩子还能回来了
We get the kid back.

371
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,330
没门
No deal.

372
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,790
我会处理的
I'll handle it.

373
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,280
我的姐姐  我来解决
My sister, my problem.

374
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,270
这是我的节日
My holiday!

375
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,560
孩子们刚停好车
Oh! That's the kids pulling up right now.

376
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,450
-表现正常一点  -我生来就很正常
- Just act normal. - I was born normal.

377
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,970
不对  他们说我出生时自带刘海
Not really. They said I came out with bangs.

378
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,400
现在我们只要口径一致就行了
Hey. Now all we have to do is stick the landing.

379
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,360
别行为怪异露出破绽
Don't blow it by acting weird.

380
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
-我很想你  -伙计
- Oh! I missed you! - Buddy!

381
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,860
自驾游怎么样
Oh, how was the drive?!

382
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,630
很不错
Oh, it was great.

383
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,760
-没错  -是吗
- Yeah. - Yeah?

384
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,020
我们本该很早就到的
We would have been here a lot earlier,

385
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,570
但是路上太堵了...
but there was a ton of traffic on...

386
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,420
美国路上
A-America.

387
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,990
我们去找外公怎么样
What do you say we go find Grandpa, huh?

388
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,930
-好呀  -去吧  一起去吧
- Yes. - Here we go. Let's go.

389
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,840
这周过得好吗
So, uh, good week?

390
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,710
我也一样
Same.

391
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,260
-天啊  他们在聊天  -是吗
- Oh, my God. They're talking. - Are they?

392
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,540
好了  你们俩话唠
All right, you chatterboxes.

393
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,260
我们开始派对吧
Let's get this party started, huh?

394
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,730
是啊  都快4点了
Yeah, it's almost 4:00.

395
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,600
1点
1:00.

396
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,260
做得真不错
That was great.

397
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,870
真的吗
Really?

398
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,250
假的  但你说谎就这样
No. But that's how you lie.

399
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,960
去洗把脸吧
Go splash some water on your face.

400
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,900
大家好
Hey, guys.

401
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,080
你怎么样
Hi! How are you?

402
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
小卡和莉莉在哪里
Hi. Where are Cam and Lily?

403
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,190
他们还在农场
Uh, they're still at the farm.

404
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,440
我被驱逐出场了
I got banished.

405
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,730
你好像有很多话要说
Sounds like you're ramping up to a story,

406
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,380
但我还有些事要处理  所以...
but I got some stuff going on, so...

407
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,700
好吧  回家"太好了"
Okay. Good to be home.

408
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,500
好吧  小卡的奶奶  那个叫我娘炮的人
Okay, so Cam's grandmother, the one who called me a sissy,

409
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,430
她死了
she died.

410
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,370
而我在她去世的那一刻跟她独处
And I -- I was alone with her when it happened,

411
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,450
然后全家人都以为是我推波助澜的
and the family thinks that I nudged it along.

412
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,890
-小卡的奶奶死了  -我的天啊
- Cam's grandma died? - Oh, my God.

413
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,500
你还是这样  只要一说到死亡
You still do that thing where you smile

414
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,760
你就会开始微笑
whenever you talk about death.

415
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,770
这只是一种应对机制  很快就会好
It's just a coping mechanism. It's gonna pass.

416
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,070
从我十岁  我们在后院
You've been doing it since I was 10 years old

417
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,780
埋我的仓鼠时  你就这么笑了
and we buried my hamster in the backyard.

418
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,290
他叫美髯公
His name was Whiskers.

419
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,950
你能正常一下吗
Can you be a human being for one second?

420
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,990
在他们全家都针对我的时候
So, Cam totally took his family's side

421
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,730
小卡完全站在他家人那一边
when they all turned against me.

422
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,060
那不过是习惯而已
Well, that's just a reflex.

423
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,230
你也总是站在你家人的这一边
You always take your family's side.

424
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,780
得了吧  什么时候的事
Oh, come on. Where is that written?

425
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,170
还记得你第一次带小卡回家
Remember when you first brought Cam home

426
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,410
然后我私下跟你说
and I privately said to you,

427
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,380
"你最好再考虑要不要换一个"
"You might want to move on from this one,"

428
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,290
然后爸说  "我还以为你喜欢纯爷们"呢
and Dad said, "I thought you liked men"?

429
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,370
然后当小卡以为
And then when Cam thought

430
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,380
他发现到我们不喜欢他时
he was picking up on us not liking him,

431
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,340
你就跟小卡说他疯了
you told Cam he was crazy.

432
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,330
我好像真是这么做了
I guess I did do that, huh?

433
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,730
天啊  你和爸可真毒啊
God, you and Dad are mean.

434
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,690
你个杀人凶手还有脸说了
Aww. Says the murderer.

435
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,150
歌洛莉亚  我们不能干坐在这  打给桑娅吧
Gloria, we can't sit around doing nothing. Call Sonia.

436
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,140
让她带着曼尼和曲奇到一个双方同意的地方
Tell her to bring Manny and the cookies to a neutral place,

437
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,800
然后我们来完成这笔交易
and we'll make the exchange.

438
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,630
为什么我要交易  我们拥有一切筹码
Why would I make an exchange? We have all the leverage.

439
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,860
她手上有你儿子
She has your son.

440
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,740
她能怎么  抚养曼尼吗
What is she gonna do? Raise Manny?

441
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,440
别担心  他会没事的
Don't worry. He's going to be fine.

442
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,850
肯定还有更好的方法
There's got to be a better way.

443
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,760
我父母一定会担心死的
My parents will be worried sick.

444
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,270
话说回来  她为什么想抢你的辣酱生意
Why does she want your sauce business, anyway?

445
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,250
或许她有理由认为
Well, maybe she has a reason to think

446
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,970
这生意理应有她的一杯羹
that it should be partly hers.

447
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,750
我已故的阿姨
My late aunt

448
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,030
将那份辣酱秘方传给了我们姐妹二人
gave that hot-sauce recipe to both of us.

449
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,160
不是只给了歌洛莉亚一个人
Not just Gloria.

450
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,660
当时桑娅根本不在意那份秘方
Sonia didn't care about the recipe.

451
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,910
她以前可懒了
She was very lazy.

452
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,690
我当时说  "也许我会去美国卖辣酱
I said, "Maybe I'll go to America and sell the sauce.

453
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,750
试着闯出自己的一片天地"
Try to make something of myself."

454
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,260
所以我很婉转地劝她放弃了
So I gently talked her out of it.

455
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,160
她说我的主意蠢爆了
She told me my idea was stupid --

456
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,720
就像我所有的主意一样蠢
just like all my ideas.

457
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,560
然后我改变了主意  实现了她的梦想
And then I changed my mind, and I did her dream.

458
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,050
她有什么可生气的
What is she so mad about?

459
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,300
我很抱歉把你牵扯进这场夙怨
I'm sorry to involve you in this feud.

460
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,350
没关系
It's okay.

461
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,120
其实我开始明白你这边的辛酸了
I'm actually starting to see your side of this.

462
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,010
谢谢你
Thank you.

463
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,670
只要这不是那种
As long as this isn't that thing

464
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,310
被绑架的人爱上绑匪的情况就好
where the person gets kidnapped and then --

465
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,760
为何我到今时今日才注意到你是如此美丽
Why am only now noticing how beautiful you are?

466
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,550
我的天
Ay, dios mio.

467
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,900
惊喜
Surprise!

468
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,170
父亲节快乐
Happy Father's Day!

469
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,450
等等  你们特意飞回来的吗
Wait -- you guys flew in?

470
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,410
是的  我希望咱们今天能一起过
Yeah, I just wanted us to all be together today.

471
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,910
尽管你做事不过脑又欠考虑
In spite of your thoughtlessness and insensitivity.

472
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,730
那两个词是一个意思  不过随便吧
Okay, those mean the same thing, but okay.

473
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,670
我只想让你知道
Look, I just want you to know

474
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,550
我明白你为什么选择站在你家人那边
I understand why you took your family's side.

475
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,340
还有我很抱歉让你处在两难的境地
And I am sorry I put you in that position.

476
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,870
谢谢你  米奇尔
Oh, I appreciate that, Mitchell.

477
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,840
节哀顺变
I'm so sorry for your loss.

478
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,030
我能把我们的礼物从车里拿出来吗
Can I get our gifts out of the car?

479
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,070
太奶奶在遗嘱里给我们都留了东西
Grams left us all something in her will --

480
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,000
连你都有
even you.

481
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,080
她居然给我留了东西
She left me something! Aww.

482
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,730
尽管你又固执又顽固
Even though you're stubborn and pigheaded.

483
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,120
你又用俩同义的...  算了
Okay, again -- Oh...

484
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,430
曼尼回来了
Manny's here.

485
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,340
我不得不把他送回来
I had to bring him back.

486
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,720
我快被他那双大圆眼瞪疯了
He was driving me crazy with his googly eyes.

487
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,820
与你的明眸相比我这不过是毫无生气的肉球
My eyes are but lifeless orbs compared to --

488
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,040
行了  去给我拿瓶啤酒
Yeah, go get me a beer.

489
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,020
你胆敢抢走我儿子
How dare you take my son.

490
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,510
你胆敢抢走我的商业模式
How dare you take my business model.

491
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,750
二位  家里还开着派对呢
Guys, we have a party going on.

492
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,000
咱移驾到这边来吵
Let's take it over here.

493
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,970
歌洛莉亚  你自己也承认过
Now, Gloria, you have admitted yourself

494
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,570
你有专从这姑娘那偷东西的黑历史
that you have a history of stealing things from this one here.

495
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,500
又来了
Oh, here we go.

496
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,880
桑娅多完美
Sonia's perfect,

497
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,800
而歌洛莉亚干啥啥不行
and Gloria can't do anything right!

498
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,540
你这话听起来像我父亲一样
You sound just like my father!

499
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,350
等等
Hold on.

500
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,500
你是说多年来这些争执
Are you saying that all this

501
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,900
都只是要争父亲宠爱的诡异竞争吗
is about some weird competition over your father?

502
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,330
这就是你毁我一生的原因吗
This is why you sabotage my whole life?

503
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,110
因为爸爸爱我多过你
Because Papa loved me more?

504
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,320
指向我的手指倒是让我爱不起来
Don't love that.

505
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,470
我的天  好像是这样
Oh, my God. I guess so.

506
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,680
真让我难以置信
I can't believe it.

507
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,890
你也会嫉妒我
You are jealous of me.

508
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,340
只在这一个方面嫉妒
Just in that one area.

509
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,790
但我不该因为爸爸专宠你就对你不好
But I shouldn't treat you badly because Papa choose you.

510
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,220
对一个小女孩来说肯定很难熬
It must have been hard for a little girl.

511
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,930
当你在如此年幼时失去那份宠爱
When you lose a love like that at such a young age,

512
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,880
你将用余生去寻找替代品
you spend the rest of your life trying to replace it.

513
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,890
别指了
Okay.

514
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,330
如果你想要辣酱生意
Listen, if you want the hot-sauce business,

515
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,450
尽管拿去  是你的了
take it -- it's yours.

516
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,760
不  有你的嫉妒我就心满意足了
No, no. Your jealousy is all I need.

517
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,330
我想把一件对我很珍贵的东西送给你
I want to give you something that is very precious to me.

518
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,220
可别是曼尼
Not Manny.

519
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,940
那是一件我老早以前就该给你的东西
It's something that I should have given you a long time ago

520
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,810
它会让你和爸爸的感情永远紧系在一起
that is gonna keep you close to Papa forever.

521
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,000
莉莉  我们说好一起拆奶奶的礼物
Oh! Lily, we were gonna open Grams' gifts together!

522
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,330
我等不及了  太奶奶给你留了一块表
I couldn't wait. Grams left you a watch.

523
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,610
信里说
Oh! The note says,

524
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,690
"这是你爷爷从一个
"Your grandpa tore it right off of

525
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,510
死德国佬的手腕上拽下来的"
a dead kraut's wrist."

526
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,120
太感人了
Oh, that's so sweet!

527
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,550
我的礼物是这些
And I got these.

528
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,540
"我所有旧唇膏你就好好用吧
"Enjoy all my old lipstick,

529
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,750
你个大娘炮"
you big sissy."

530
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,510
她为什么要叫我娘炮
Why did she call me a sissy?

531
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,100
我  她不是那意思
I -- She doesn't --

532
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,310
我们这就拆奶奶的礼物了吗
Oh! We're opening Grams' gifts, huh?

533
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,950
-这份肯定是给你的  -好
- This must be yours. - Okay.

534
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,640
我们  我们也不是非现在拆不可
Let -- You know, we can do this later.

535
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,650
你都把你的拆了
You opened yours.

536
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,670
好的
Okay.

537
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,520
"当小卡初次带你回家来时
"When Cam first brought you here,

538
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,250
我以为我永远不会有看你顺眼的一天
I thought I'd never get used to you.

539
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,890
我从小就被教育仇恨你这种人
I was raised to hate your kind.

540
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,320
但当我见到你让我孙子那么开心
But seeing how happy you make my grandson,

541
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,570
我也忍不住在乎起你来了"
I... couldn't help but come to care for you."

542
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,360
小卡  是我误会她了
Cam. I was wrong about her.

543
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,610
是啊  是你误会了
Yes. You were.

544
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,510
我们把信拿去收好吧
Now, let's put this someplace safe.

545
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,760
别  等等  还有呢还有呢
No, no, wait. There's more. There's more.

546
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,090
"除了你还有谁
"Who else but you

547
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,350
更适合继承我挚爱的东方扇子
should inherit my beloved Oriental fan?

548
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,540
我希望它不会让你太想家"
I hope it don't make you homesick."

549
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,200
她本来说要把扇子给我的
She said I was gonna get that fan.

550
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,750
她临终前脑子非常不灵光了
Well, you know, she did get very stupid near the end.

551
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,400
好了  拆礼物时间到此为止
Okay, well, gift time seems to be over.

552
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,620
小卡  这是给莉莉的礼物对吗
Okay, Cam. This is Lily's gift, isn't it?

553
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,170
不是
No.

554
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,520
原来你才是那个大娘炮
Oh! So you're the big sissy!

555
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,830
给你
Here.

556
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,670
她的口红
Her lipsticks!

557
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,980
我猜你又要多想了吧
Oh. I suppose you're gonna read into this, too.

558
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,140
这些香肠闻起来好香
Wow, those sausages smell fantastic!

559
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,410
你还好吗  老爸
You all right, Dad?

560
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,640
还行  我不介意说我几句话
Yeah, I guess I could say a few words.

561
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,230
很感谢你们在这个伟大节日向我表示敬意
I appreciate you guys honoring me on this great holiday.

562
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,810
但我不是在座唯一的父亲
But I'm not the only dad here.

563
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,780
你们三个生在那个家真是走运  对吗
You three lucked out a little bit in that department, right?

564
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,850
确实是
We sure did.

565
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,530
我此生最好的工作
Best job I ever had.

566
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,710
养大两个非同凡响的女儿
Raising two dynamite ladies

567
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,900
还有夫复何求的最好的哥们
and the...best buddy a guy could ever ask for.

568
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,270
这是什么
Oh, what is with this?

569
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,540
-今年没有疯狂面包吗  -对啊
- No crazy bread this year? - Yeah!

570
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,440
我们在纽约又待了五天
We stayed in New York for five more days.

571
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,620
我看到大卫·布莱恩在果冻里
And I saw David Blaine in jello,

572
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,800
我一直超想告诉你  但她们不让
and I've been dying to tell you, but they wouldn't let me!

573
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,590
你真是个废物
You're a disgrace.

574
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,980
天啊  你们妈妈和我
Oh, my God! Your mother and I --

575
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,170
非常愤怒  愤怒
Are furious! Furious!

576
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,220
你们一直待在纽约
You were in New York this whole time,

577
00:18:59,220 --> 00:18:59,850
却什么都没告诉...
and you didn't say anything --

578
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,080
听着  我不知道这一团糟是怎么回事
Now, I don't know what can of worms this is,

579
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,690
但我知道这是我的节日
but I know this is my day,

580
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,540
我要你们都冷静下来
and I want you to calm down.

581
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,330
你口袋里有个手机吗
Is that a phone in your pocket?

582
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,280
这是我的手机
That's my phone.

583
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,720
我从昨天就在找这个手机了
I've been looking for this since yesterday.

584
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,990
我会偷东西了
I steal now.

585
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,740
菲尔  你给我发短信了吗
Phil, did you text me?

586
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,830
是的  克莱尔让我给你发一张
Oh, yeah, um, claire asked me to send you a picture

587
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,710
我们在纽约住的酒店里衣柜的照片
of the closet in our New York hotel.

588
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,370
老天  这是你赤身裸体吗
Oh, my God! Is this you naked?!

589
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,270
什么
What?

590
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,170
为什么
Why?

591
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,520
亲爱的  你能给我爸发张衣柜的照片吗
Honey, will you send my dad a picture of that closet

592
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,710
免得我忘了
before I forget?

593
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,770
天啊  不要
Oh! No.

594
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,040
你们在吵什...
Hey. What's all the --

595
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,400
好吧  不要  谢谢
O...kay. No, thanks.

596
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,520
我已经对一个亲戚有不清不白的想法了
I already have confusing feelings for one relative.

597
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,070
好吧  这事就到此为止
All...right. Can this just be done now?

598
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,840
你是怎么...
How did you even --

599
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,350
等等  照片背景在下雨
Wait a minute. It is raining in the background.

600
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,110
但我们一起在纽约时根本没下雨
But it didn't rain while we were all there.

601
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,720
纽约只有昨天才下了场雨
It only rained in New York yesterday.

602
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,890
天啊  你们留在纽约居然不带我们
Oh, my God! You stayed in New York without us!

603
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,230
我们说谎了
We're liars!

604
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,590
对不起
I'm so sorry.

605
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,110
不  是我的错  是我一直撒谎
No, it's my fault. I -- I kept the lie going.

606
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,830
我们真的要忽略
Okay, are we really glossing over the fact

607
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,770
我也能察觉出猫腻这事吗
that I figured something out?

608
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,410
我来告诉你们还忽略了什么
I'll tell you what else we're glossing over --

609
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:01,620
你们在父亲节表现多糟糕
how bad you all are at Father's Day.

610
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,760
我一个儿子有偷盗癖
I've got one son who's a kleptomaniac,

611
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,710
另一个喜欢上自己的亲姨
the other who's in love with his own aunt --

612
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,240
即使照你的标准也太恶心人
creepy even by your standards --

613
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,770
还有一个女儿  让我被迫看了她
and a daughter who I was forced to see naked

614
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,210
像刚出生时赤裸的样子
as the day she was born.

615
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,380
来吧  小卡  来亲我这个娘炮
Come on, Cam. Kiss me like the sissy I am!

616
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,170
-来的真是时候  -天啊
- Right on cue. - Oh, God.

617
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,560
祝我自己父亲节快乐
Happy Father's Day to me.

618
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,370
再来个锦上添花  我刚发现
Icing on the cake -- I just found out

619
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,990
我的妻子有严重的恋父情结
my own wife has major daddy issues.

620
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,690
让我不禁想这才是她和我一起的真正原因
Makes me wonder if that's the whole reason she's with me.

621
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,640
老爸  别乱说
Dad, come on.

622
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,610
我们或许毁了你的节日  我承认
We may have ruined your day, yes,

623
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,080
但你现在只是在穿凿附会
but now you're just spiraling.

624
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,470
每一段感情都有各自的问题
I mean, every relationship has its issues,

625
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,530
但歌洛莉亚超级喜欢你
and Gloria adores you!

626
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,770
享受这胜利吧
Take the win.

627
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,130
你们真这么想吗
You think?

628
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,030
爸爸真的好英俊
Papa was so handsome.

629
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,350
-真的  -真的
- Yes! - Yes. Yes. Yes!

630
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,460
好啦
All right!

631
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,340
你们每人盘子里都有一根香肠
You each have a sausage on your plate

632
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,860
我是根据你们每人的性格气质挑选的
I selected based on your individual personality and temperament.

633
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,700
这是血肠吗  为什么我的是粉色
Is this blood sausage? Because mine's pink.

634
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,590
我的也是粉红色...
Oh, my mine's pink, t--

635
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,020
很好笑  老爸
Oh. Very funny, Dad.

636
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,470
咬一口面包
Now take a bite of bread,

637
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,520
抿一口水净化一下味蕾
a sip of water to cleanse the palate.

638
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,320
我的闻起来很辣
Mine smells spicy.

639
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,790
来举个手  谁听到我说"闻闻香肠"了
Show of hands. Who heard me say "Smell your sausage"?

640
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,360
盒子上说这些猪每天被按摩
The box said these pigs were massaged daily,

641
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,170
然后从背后被杀
then killed from behind to

642
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,230
免得让恐慌荷尔蒙污染了肉质
keep the panic hormone from tainting the meat.

643
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,240
它们从背后被杀
They were murdered from behind?

644
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,350
我要你们注意三件事
The three things I want you to pay attention to

645
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,130
香气  口感还有余味
are bouquet, texture, and finish.

646
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,160
你们可以开始了
You may begin.

647
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,320
能给我来点番茄酱吗
Can I have some ketchup?

648
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,250
别说了  散会吧
We are done here.
