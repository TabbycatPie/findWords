哥谭
第一季  第十六集

71
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,170
你为什么要攻击格雷森先生
Why did you attack Mr. Grayson?

72
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,110
不为什么
No reason.

73
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,690
我不喜欢他
I don't like him.

74
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,330
我不知道他为什么要这样
I have no idea why he did it.

75
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,040
我怎么知道
Beats me.

76
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,930
你们马戏团的都动真格的啊
Wow, you circus people don't mess around, do you?

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,830
我发誓  约翰・格雷森
I swear, John Grayson,

78
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,130
如果你再这样看着我
if you give me that look one more time,

79
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,460
我就一巴掌扇上去
I will slap you silly.

80
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,300
你想得美
You wish.

81
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,490
别以为我不敢
Don't think I can't.

82
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,960
好了  孩子们
Whoa, kids.

83
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,490
你们这是有什么矛盾啊
What's the big problem, anyhow?

84
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,990
格雷森一家都是自负的混蛋  就这问题
The Graysons are a bunch of arrogant buttheads is the problem.

85
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,360
劳埃德一家都是不负责任的酒鬼
The Lloyds are feckless drunkards,

86
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,580
这才是问题
is more like it.

87
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,070
那么是家族世仇了
So it's a family feud.

88
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,740
格雷森一家和劳埃德一家有过节
Graysons don't get along with Lloyds.

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,290
已经有很多年了
Been that way for years.

90
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,780
都已经成为传统了
It's sort of a tradition.

91
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,570
你们每晚都这样打一架吗
You guys fight like this every night?

92
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,290
不是
No.

93
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,950
那只是她蠢货叔叔在犯蠢
That was just her idiot uncle doing his thing.

94
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,310
你明明知道肯定是因为莱拉
You know damn well it must be Lila's fault.

95
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,880
-玛莉  -干吗
- Mary... - What?

96
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,650
抱歉约会被毁了
Sorry the date went south.

97
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:23,550
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding?

98
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,380
最棒的一次约会
Best date ever.

99
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,940
可不是谁都能看到马戏团斗殴
Who gets to see a circus brawl?

100
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,440
也是
True.

101
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,990
他们都不肯开口
None of them will talk, of course.

102
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,300
所以我不知道他们为什么打架
So I've no idea what those two were fighting over.

103
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,360
我觉得他们是情敌
I think they're rival lovers.

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,260
他们家族很早之前就开始互相敌视了
Their families have been fighting since way back,

105
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,890
但是这次打架
but this particular fight

106
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,160
显然是为了一个名叫莱拉的女人
was apparently over a woman named Lila.

107
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,970
她是穿插表演的蛇舞演员
She's a Snake Dancer in the sideshow.

108
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,320
是啊  多酷啊  一位蛇舞演员
I know. How cool is that? A snake dancer.

109
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,060
我是说  你干的真棒
No, I mean, wow, you're really good.

110
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,300
-人们愿意对医生开口  -看来是的
- People talk to doctors. - I guess so.

111
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,210
我得去找到这个莱拉
I should find this woman Lila,

112
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,210
确保她没事
make sure she's okay.

113
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,120
可能会需要点时间
Might take little awhile.

114
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,690
我让巡警载你回家好了
I'll have a patrolman drive you home.

115
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,810
我可以和你一起去啊
I could come with you.

116
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,560
小莱  这是警方事务
Lee, this is police business.

117
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,850
拜托了  吉姆
Come on, Jim.

118
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,510
我好想见见莱拉
I'm dying to meet Lila.

119
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,590
带着医护人员
Well, bringing along medical personnel

120
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,060
倒也算是合理的预防措施吧
is a justifiable precaution, I guess.

121
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,040
这就是了
There you go.

122
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,710
先生...莱拉在哪
Sir... where's Lila?

123
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,790
莱拉
Lila?

124
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,870
那个蛇舞演员

她不在这里
She's not here.

128

怎么了  发生什么了
Why? What's happened?

129
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,790
她在哪里
Where is she?

130
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,620
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

131
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,610
她早就应该回家了
She was supposed to be home ages ago.

132
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,580
你是她亲戚吗
You a relative?

133
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,970
我是她儿子  杰罗姆
Uh, I'm her son-- Jerome.

134
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,400
杰罗姆  你最后一次见到她是什么时候
Jerome, when did you last see her?

135
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,960
今早
This morning.

136
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,220
我出发去图书馆时她还在这里
She was here when I left for the library.

137
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,380
放松  杰罗姆  这位先生来这里
Relax, Jerome, this gentleman is just here

138
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,430
只是因为欧文和阿尔起了点争执
because Owen and Al had a disagreement.

139
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,520
你妈妈没事的  肯定又是去寻欢了
Your mother's fine, gone on a spree, no doubt.

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,740
-你知道她的  -寻欢
- You know how she is. - A spree?

141
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,870
没戴帽子  没穿大衣  钱包也没带吗
Without her hat, her coat or her purse?

142
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,200
看看希巴
And look at Sheba.

143
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,130
她心神不宁的
She's distraught.

144
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,430
她知道出事了
She knows something's wrong.

145
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,700
那条蛇看起来是有点烦躁啊
The snake does seem to be agitated.

146
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,410
警官...
Sir...

147

她就是那种交际女
she's what you call a party girl.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,250
早上就会回来了  包里装着小内裤
Back in the morning with her knickers in a handbag,

149
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,230
毫无疑问

150
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,110
但她没带包啊  不是吗
But she didn't take her handbag, did she?

151
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,510
蛇移动速度能有多快
How fast does an animal like that move?

152
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,400
人类快走的速度
Oh, fast walking pace.

153
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,390
它们主要是靠偷袭取胜
They rely on surprise, mainly.

154
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,580
放她出来
Let her out.

155
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,590
什么
I'm sorry?

156
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,160
放她出来
Let her out.

157
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,440
天呐
Oh, my God.

158
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,830
你知道
You knew.

159
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,230
你知道她在这里
You knew she was here.

160
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,960
不知道
No.

161
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,850
看着我
Look at me.

162
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,510
我们找到她时她就那样了
She was like that when we found her.

163
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,130
咱们打开天窗说亮话吧
Let's talk straight.

164
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,540
上面那些人
Those people out there

165
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,920
利用我们作为移植手术的供体
are using us as transplant donors.

166
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,630
我们只是零部件
We are simply spare parts.

167
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,460
除非...
Unless...

168
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,520
除非我们有所行动
unless we do something about it.

169
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,650
怎么行动
How?

170
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,200
我有个计划
I have a plan.

171
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,510
但是你们必须完全照我说的做
But you must do exactly what I say.

172
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,630
你们听我的  我保证
You do as I say, and I promise you,

173
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,200
我能把我们中一部分人  活着弄出去
I will get some of us out of here alive.

174
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,080
没错
That's right.

175
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,980
是的  你们没听错
No, you heard me correctly.

176
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,050
我说的是  我们中...一部分人
I said, some... of us.

177
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,270
因为事实就是一部分人会死掉
Because the truth of the matter is some will die.

178
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,530
但是我们会有尊严地死去
But we will die with dignity.

179
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,860
我们会死得其所
We will die for a reason,

180
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,040
我们会和家人死在一起
and we will die next to family,

181
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,050
而我要告诉你们  我们是一家人
and I tell you what-- we are family.

182
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,150
我们只有彼此
We're all we got.

183
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,520
那就是家人
That's family!

184
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,720
我们的选择很简单
We have one simple choice:

185
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,810
我们跪着孤单死在这里
we die here alone on our knees

186
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:14,830
或是我们站起来和家人一起战斗
or we stand up and we fight with our family!

187
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,390
几个流浪汉在这里发现了她
A couple of riggers found her right here.

188
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,200
我们决定把她藏在卡车上
We decided to hide her on the truck.

189
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,660
我们本打算一上路
We were going to give her a proper burial

190
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,390
就给她办个体面的葬礼
as soon as we got back on the road.

191
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,190
你还真是好心
Decent of you.

192
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,800
"我们"是指谁  还有谁知道
Who's "we"? Who else knew?

193
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,820
只有我和家长
Just me and the head of the families.

194
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,220
假如是外人杀了她  还能怎么办
If an outsider killed her, what can you do?

195
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,380
只能说是天意了
An act of God.

196
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,690
假如是我们的人做的
If it was one of us,

197
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,210
我们总会查明的
we always find out.

198
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,750
我们会确保此人得到惩罚
And we make sure they're punished.

199
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,570
怎么惩罚
How?

200
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,130
我们自有办法
We have our ways.

201
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,490
我们也有
And we have ours.

202
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,140
把他铐起来
Hook him up.

203
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,040
早上好啊  搭档
Morning, partner.

204
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,530
我需要你帮忙
Gonna need a little help here.

205
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,870
真不是开玩笑
No kidding.

206
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,600
你开玩笑吧
I mean, you're kidding, right?

207
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,610
这不会是恶作剧吧
This isn't an elaborate prank or...?

208
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,620
说说你母亲  杰罗姆
Tell me about your mother, Jerome.

209
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,730
她是我母亲
She's my mother.

210
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,800
还能说什么  我爱她
What can I say? I love her.

211
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,700
她很完美
She's perfect.

212
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,670
不算个好厨子
Not a very good cook.

213
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
除此以外都好
Except for that...

214
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,100
她有敌人吗
Did she have any enemies?

215
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,170
跟谁结过仇
Someone with a grudge?

216
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,830
没有
No.

217
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,590
男友呢
Boyfriends?

218
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,350
没有
No.

219
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,310
没有吗
No?

220
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,980
她有过很多情人
She had lovers.

221
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,250
其实就是炮友  都不是男友
They're sex partners really, but not boyfriends.

222
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,000
她不想给人承诺
She didn't want the commitment.

223
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,840
阿方斯・格雷森是吗
Alphonse Grayson?

224
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,230
是的  他是其中之一
Yes, he was one of them.

225
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,290
欧文・劳埃德呢
Owen Lloyd?

226
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,500
也是
Yes.

227
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,430
还有别人吗
Any others?

228
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,090
我说得上名字的就这两个
Not that I could put a name to.

229
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,170
你怎么看你母亲的感情生活
How do you feel about your mother's love life?

230
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:18,880
我无所谓
I feel fine about it.

231
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,790
如果不是因为她有感情生活
If not for my mother's love life,

232
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,310
我也不会出生了  对不对
I wouldn't be here, would I?

233
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,670
性是健康的人类活动
Sex is a healthy human activity.

234
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,690
没错  是的
Yes, it is.

235
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,180
你还有其他家人吗
Do you have any other family?

236
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,130
马戏团就是我的家
The circus is my family.

237
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,610
我再问一遍  你为什么要打格雷森先生
One more time. Why did you assault Mr. Grayson?

238
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,740
你知道为什么
You know why.

239
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,540
-说说吧  -他杀了莱拉
- Tell me. - He killed Lila.

240
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,750
他为什么要杀她
Why would he do that?

241
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,520
因为她要选我而放弃他
She was gonna choose me over him,

242
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,450
而他是个自大的混蛋
and he's an arrogant son of a bitch.

243
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,490
不愿让劳埃德家的人那样侮辱格雷森家的人
Not gonna let a Lloyd humiliate a Grayson that way.

244
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,260
你们两家人为什么合不来
How come your families don't get along?

245
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,960
他曾祖父
His great-grandfather

246
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,980
冤枉我母亲的叔叔巴瑞偷马
falsely accused my mother's uncle Barry of stealing a horse.

247
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,990
这什么时候的事
When was this?

248
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,630
大战之前
Before the Great War.

249
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,740
-第一次世界大战  -是
- World War One. - Yeah.

250
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,840
你们两家
For three generations,

251
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,970
三代敌视就因为一匹被偷的马
your families have been feuding over a stolen horse?

252
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,080
是的  劳埃德一家人仍是一群渣滓
Yes. And the Lloyds are still trash.

253
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,970
基因不会变
Blood is blood.

254
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,840
那匹马一定很贵重
Must be a hell of a horse.

255
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,940
劳埃德先生为什么要打你
Why did Mr. Lloyd assault you?

256
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,150
因为他杀了莱拉  怕我会因此杀了他
He killed Lila, and fears I'm gonna kill him for it.

257
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,670
他的说法正相反
He says the opposite.

258
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,120
他说是你杀了她
He says you killed her.

259
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,960
是啊  他当然会这么说了
Yes, I suppose he would have to say that, wouldn't he?

260
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,710
不是欧文叔叔
It wasn't Uncle Owen.

261
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,470
他绝不会做这么可怕的事
He could never do such a terrible thing.

262
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,850
我靠  玛莉
Holy crap, Mary!

263
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,220
你怎么这么不长眼睛
How can you be so blind?

264
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,600
你闭嘴
Quiet, you.

265
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,920
就是  你闭嘴
Yeah, quiet, you.

266
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,640
你才不长眼睛呢
You're the blind one.

267
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,130
我哥哥是正人君子
My brother is a man of honor.

268
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,420
你叔叔是暴力酒鬼
Your uncle is a violent drunk.

269
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,040
-算算吧  小女孩  -我叔叔是位艺人
- Do the math, little girl. - My uncle is an artist.

270
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,130
你哥哥是个自大的肌肉男
Your brother is a conceited muscle-head,

271
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,360
你们这群飞人傻帽都一个样
like the rest of you flying douche bags.

272
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,910
真不敢相信我还以为自己爱你
I can't believe I ever thought I loved you.

273
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,010
够了
Enough.

274
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,560
他们来了
They're coming.

275
00:14:58,990 --> 00:14:59,870
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

276
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,440
准备好了
Yes!

277
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,150
准备好了吗
I said, are you ready?!

278
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,640
准备好了
Yes!

279
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,700
57A号犯人  举起手来
Inmate 57A, raise your hand.

280
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,460
57A

281
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,590
举起手来
Raise your hand.

282
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,980
向前一步
Step forward.

283
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,480
请等等  先生
One moment, please, sir.

284
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,690
咱们得谈谈
We need to talk.

285
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,190
往后退  犯人
Back up, inmate.

286
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,680
你违规了
You're in violation.

287
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,980
57A
57A,

288
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,060
向前一步
step forward!

289
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,650
打断一下  谢谢
Excuse me one moment, please.

290
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,790
现在这里我说了算
I'm the new "Shot caller" here.

291
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,890
我叫菲什・穆尼
My name is Fish Mooney,

292
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,360
无意冒犯  不过为了你我
and with all due respect, for you and I

293
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,760
今后能营造良好的工作关系
to have a good working relationship,

294
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,950
有些规矩恐怕得改改
there's some things that need to change.

295
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,240
是吗
Is that right?

296
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,480
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

297
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,350
我叫什么名字你管不着
None of your damn business what my name is.

298
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,000
好吧
Right. Okay, well...

299
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,580
我知道你现在公务在身
I know you have a job to do.

300
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,170
而我也很乐意把57A交给你
And I am more than willing to give you 57A,

301
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,340
不过我要你拿60箱饮用水
in exchange for 60 crates of water,

302
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,510
30条毛毯  50磅新鲜水果

303
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,430
还有几本杂志来换
and a few magazines.

304
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,680
我要是拒绝呢
What if I refuse?

305
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,320
你会怎么办
What will you do?

306
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,410
我还是一样乐意把57A交给你
Well, I'd be willing to give you 57A,

307
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,350
只是要交死的了
just not alive.

308
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,220
我们要活的
We need them alive.

309
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,560
我知道啊
Exactly.

310
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,870
我数到三之前
I'm gonna count to three.

311
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,850
你赶紧闪人
You'll disappear

312
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,880
否则我让你吃不了兜着走
or get a severe beating.

313
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,700
我想你这算是拒绝了吧
I'm gonna take that as a no.

314
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,680
一
One...

315
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,790
二
two...

316
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,070
这是简单的生意经
It's simple economics.

317
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,300
我们的命是有价值的
Our lives are worth something.

318
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,690
我要60箱饮用水  30条毛毯
60 crates of water, 30 blankets...

319
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,590
你
You...

320
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,200
你跟我走
you're coming with me.

321
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,990
主管一定会生你气的
The Manager is gonna be very unhappy with you.

322
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,390
我想这位主管
I would think this Manager

323
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,980
对你也不会很满意吧
wouldn't be too happy with you either.

324
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,560
所以如果他想跟我谈
So if he wants to talk to me,

325
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,510
我就在这儿等他
I'll be right here.

326
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,620
主管不会下来这里
Manager doesn't come down here.

327
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,610
看来我们是陷入僵局了
Well, looks like we have a standoff.

328
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,650
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

329
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,610
我很好说话的
I can be flexible.

330
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,600
我可以去见这位主管
So I'll go talk to this Manager,

331
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,260
但我离开期间  你得作为贵宾
but while I'm gone, you're going to stay right here,

332
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,750
留在这里
as our guest.

333
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,670
怎么样
How's that sound?

334
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,200
我们还会回来的
We'll be back.

335
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,290
耶
Yeah!

336
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,180
等等  往回倒
Wait, back up a little.

337
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,620
你放出了蛇吗
So you set the snake loose?

338
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,340
-是的  长官  -为了追踪尸体
- Yes, ma'am. - To track down the body?

339
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,460
是的  长官
Yes, ma'am.

340
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,630
蛇嗅觉十分敏锐
Snakes have an excellent sense of smell.

341
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,370
嗯  长知识了
Well, now I know.

342
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,280
而你的头号嫌疑人是个小丑和一个杂技演员
And your prime suspects are a clown and an acrobat?

343
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,220
没错
Yeah.

344
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,660
他很厉害吧
Ain't this one a doozy?

345
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,830
被害人  莱拉・瓦勒斯卡
Your victim, Lila Valeska,

346
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,660
是被一把大刀或短柄斧砍伤致死
was killed by a large knife or hatchet.

347
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,730
头部和躯干多处受创
Multiple blows to the head and upper torso.

348
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,440
死亡时间大概是昨天下午3点
Around 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

349
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,980
2点30到4点15  格雷森和劳埃德
From 2:30 to 4:15, both Grayson and Lloyd

350
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,240
都在马戏团参加日场表演
were in the ring for the matinee.

351
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,430
死亡时间的精确度是多少
Well, how precise is that time of death?

352
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,240
误差在45分钟左右吧
Give or take 45 minutes.

353
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,040
那么还是有做案可能  但时间窗很短
Still possible then, but cutting it close.

354
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,470
拘留嫌疑人  施以压力
Hold and press your guys,

355
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,010
但继续寻找其他嫌疑人
but keep looking.

356
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,250
好  老大  鉴证组正在检查案发现场
Yeah, boss. Forensics is working the crime scene now.

357
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,910
我们去检查她的电话记录
We're going through her phone records.

358
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,810
好了
All right!

359
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,160
你们剩下的人可以回家了
We're gonna send the rest of you home now,

360
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,460
但是调查还在继续
but the investigation is ongoing.

361
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,960
谁也不许出城
Nobody leaves town.

362
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,650
而且给我听好
And listen up.

363
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,610
不许再打架了
No more fighting!

364
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,680
看看你们朋友的下场
Look where your friends are.

365
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,660
这世仇对你们有什么好处
What good is this feud doing you?

366
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,980
我喜欢你强硬的样子
I like it when you act all tough.

367
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,240
"谁也不许出城"
"Nobody leave town."

368
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,690
你说起来更好听
Sounds better when you say it.

369
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,210
我觉得我们该继续中断的约会
I feel like we should finish up our date.

370
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,530
今晚你想来我家吗
Do you want to come over tonight?

371
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,020
我可以给你做晚餐
I can cook you dinner.

372
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,180
好啊  听起来不错
Sure. That sounds good.

373
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,050
好
Good.

374
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,040
-好好休息  -我尽力  晚上见
- Get some rest. - I will try. See you later.

375
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,330
我得问
I have to ask.

376
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,770
如果要你猜  你认为是谁杀了莱拉
If you were to guess, who do you think killed Lila?

377
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,240
我尽量不瞎猜
I try not to guess.

378
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,770
我审问疑犯  等待鉴证报告
I work the suspects and I wait on forensics.

379
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,770
打扰一下
Excuse me.

380
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,190
你是詹姆斯・戈登警探吗
Am I speaking to Detective James Gordon?

381
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,820
是的
Yes.

382
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,760
那这位肯定是汤普金斯医生  验尸官
Then this must be Dr. Thompkins, the medical examiner.

383
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,680
抱歉  你怎么知道我们是谁
I'm sorry, how did you know who we were?

384
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,130
我叫保罗・西瑟罗
My name is Paul Cicero.

385
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,870
我是穿插表演的灵媒
I'm a psychic with the sideshow.

386
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,480
莱拉・瓦勒斯卡是我的老朋友
Lila Valeska was an old friend of mine.

387
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,420
灵媒  知道了
A psychic. I see.

388
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,100
有什么能帮你的  西瑟罗先生
How could I help you, Mr. Cicero?

389
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,320
我觉得你认为欧文和阿方斯均是无罪的
I sense that you don't think Owen or Alphonse are guilty.

390
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,730
你肯定是个灵媒
You must be psychic.

391
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,830
所以  也许你想听听莱拉
In which case, perhaps you'd like to hear the message

392
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,390
从亡灵世界给我发来的讯息
Lila sent me from the other side.

393
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,710
谢谢你  西瑟罗先生
Thanks, Mr. Cicero,

394
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,940
我们还没开始调查亡灵世界呢
we're not quite looking at the other side just yet.

395
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,540
随便你  我只不过是个信差
As you wish. I'm merely a messenger.

396
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,990
是什么讯息
What's the message?

397
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,200
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, Doctor.

398
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,630
莱拉告诉我说  魔鬼的仆人
Lila told me that the servant of the Devil

399
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,350
躺在铁姐妹的花园里
lies in the garden of the Iron Sisters.

400
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,400
铁姐妹
The Iron Sisters?

401
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,570
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

402
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,700
不知道
I don't know.

403
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,990
我们这就去调查
We'll get right on it.

404
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,230
我认为讽刺不是你的专长  詹姆斯
I don't think sarcasm is your métier, James.

405
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,820
随你怎么利用这条讯息吧
Make of the message what you will.

406
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,520
祝你们俩安好
Good day to you both.

407
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,110
你的偏见好大啊
Well, that wasn't very open-minded of you.

408
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,760
拜托  小莱  他就是个骗子
Oh, come on, Lee. He's a fraud.

409
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,280
他会直接去找媒体
He's gonna go straight to the press

410
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,690
说自己是这起案子的顾问
and say he's consulting on the case.

411
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,400
他是在藉机宣传
He's looking for publicity.

412
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,300
也许吧
Maybe.

413
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,410
如果人死后  还会发来讯息
If you were gonna send a message from beyond the grave,

414
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,160
那首先要说的
don't you think priority number one

415
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,950
不该是凶手的姓名  而不是谜语吗
would be the killer's name and not a riddle?

416
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,910
谁知道这种事是怎么回事
Who knows how it works?

417
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,590
好吧  我不想和你争论
All right. I'm not gonna argue with you.

418
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,630
很好
Good.

419
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,900
那回头见了
Later, then.

420
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,780
回头见
Later.

421
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,910
他们打电话来确认
They called to confirm

422
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,260
你明天和韦恩集团董事会的会议
your meeting with the board of Wayne Enterprises tomorrow.

423
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,790
好极了
Excellent.

424
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,170
我还担心他们会再次延期
I was afraid they'd postpone again.

425
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,130
我再说一次
Well, I'll say it one more time.

426
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,650
我认为
I think that, uh,

427
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,410
这个主意很不好  布鲁斯少爷
it's an incredibly bad idea, Master Bruce.

428
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,600
我觉得太草率  太仓促
I think it's reckless, I think it's premature,

429
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,880
而且坦白地说  我认为这样做非常危险
and, quite frankly, I think it's bloody dangerous.

430
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,120
我们已经讨论过很多次了  阿尔弗雷德
And we've already been over this 100 times, Alfred.

431
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,300
我主意已定
My mind is made up.

432
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,260
能把那份文件递给我吗
Can you pass me that file over there?

433
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,280
文件
The file...

434
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,520
好吧
well...

435
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,520
该说的我都说了
I've said my piece.

436
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,900
如果我们俩被人发现死在沟里  别怪我
If we're both found dead in a ditch, don't blame me.

437
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,790
不行
Nah.

438
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,730
不行吗
No?

439
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,010
吉姆喜欢我穿这个颜色的衣服
Jim loves me in this color.

440
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,060
太明显了
It's too obvious.

441
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,670
你要穿得不那么刻意
You gotta dress like you're not trying,

442
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,100
像是你要去和别的男人见面那样
like you're on your way to go meet some other guy.

443
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,790
出去远航
To go... sailing,

444
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,560
或别的什么事
or whatever.

445
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,690
不是吧  出航吗
Really? Sailing?

446
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,080
好吧
Okay.

447
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,680
天呐
Oh, my God.

448
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,370
你喜欢吗
You like?

449
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,850
天呐  太好吃了
Oh, my God.

450
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,140
天呐
Oh, my God!

451
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,470
出什么事了
What's wrong?

452
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,730
是好事
No, it's good.

453
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,020
我用了我姐姐的菜谱
It's my sister's recipe;

454
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,450
她做饭手艺极佳
she's a really, brilliant cook.

455
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,740
我正想着我姐
I was thinking of my sister,

456
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,080
然后就突然想到
and it came to me:

457
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,750
我想我知道那个盲眼人的讯息指什么了
I think I know what the blind man's message means.

458
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,500
魔鬼的仆人
The servant of the devil

459
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,230
躺在铁姐妹的花园里
lies in the garden of the Iron Sisters?

460
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,380
是阿卡姆大桥
It's Arkham Bridge.

461
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,140
铁姐妹  就是阿卡姆大桥
The Iron Sisters. Arkham Bridge.

462
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:36,060
桥两边的塔楼  叫玛丽和贝蒂
The towers. They're called, uh, Mary and Betty?

463
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,760
我还记得小时候
I remember, as a kid,

464
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,770
我们就这么叫  可...
we used to call them that, but...

465
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,940
没错  那里还有个公园  就在塔楼下
Right. And there's a park, um, under the towers

466
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,440
靠近哥谭这边
on the Gotham side.

467
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,410
花园  都合上了
A garden? It all fits.

468
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,350
小莱
Lee...

469
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:49,240
但这是不可能的
it fits an impossible story.

470
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,670
他没跟莱拉・瓦勒斯卡交谈过
He didn't speak with Lila Valeska,

471
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,520
-她已经死了  -这只是你的看法
- she's dead. - So you say!

472
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,520
得了  你是个医生  一个科学家
Come on, you're a doctor. A scientist.

473
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,590
这世上有很多东西
There are plenty of things in this world

474
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,490
是无法用理性科学来解释的
that can't be explained by rational science.

475
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,650
是啊  比如那些喜欢跳土风舞的人
Yeah, people who enjoy folk dancing, for instance.

476
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,290
这不代表鬼是存在的
Doesn't mean ghosts exist.

477
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,590
你的自信好盛气凌人啊
You're very arrogant in your certainty.

478
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,500
万一这是凶案的线索呢
What if this is a clue to a murder?

479
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,190
想想那个可怜的女人
The poor woman!

480
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,950
好吧  我会亲自去查看
Fine. I'll go myself.

481
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,380
-谢谢  -没事
- Thank you. - Sure.

482
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,700
-我跟你一起去  -好
- I'll come with you. - Okay.

483
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,690
我们一起去  明天一早就去
We'll go together. First thing in the morning.

484
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,960
一早
Morning?

485
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,700
现在
Now?

486
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,320
你想现在去吗
You want to go now?

487
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,510
离这里只有半英里
It's only a half a mile away.

488
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,710
已经天黑了
It's dark.

489
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,990
我有手电筒
I have a flashlight.

490
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,500
我们到底要找什么  你知道吗
So what are we looking for, exactly, do you think?

491
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,660
我明白  我明白
I know, I know.

492
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,920
也许我们只是在白费功夫
This is probably a complete waste of time.

493
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,320
-谢谢你愿意陪我出来  -不用谢
- Thank you for doing this. - No problem.

494
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,540
不过  不要习以为常了  好吗
But, uh, let's not make a habit out of it, okay?

495
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,280
这不是女士该来的地方
This is no place for a lady.

496
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:50,760
呵呵
Ha!

497
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,770
"呵呵"什么
What do you mean, "Ha"?

498
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:54,320
你好虚伪
You're a hypocrite.

499
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,240
你说你想要一个坚强的女人
You say you want a strong woman

500
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,540
与你分享你选择的疯狂人生
to share this crazy life you've chosen,

501
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,080
可在紧要关头
but when push comes to shove,

502
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,350
你却要我待在家里烤饼干
you want me to stay home and bake cookies.

503
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,190
不非得是饼干
Not cookies, necessarily.

504
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,570
烤派也行  什么派都行
Pie. Any kind of pie.

505
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:10,300
呵呵
Ha, ha!

506
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,950
如果有人从桥上的车里往下扔了什么东西
So if someone were to throw something from a car on the bridge,

507
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,500
就会落在这里
this is where it would land.

508
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,200
你想得没错
Yeah, I guess you're right.

509
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:36,990
小莱
Lee...

510
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,670
THFC
THFC.

511
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,440
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

512
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,660
地狱火俱乐部
The Hellfire Club.

513
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,430
是一个撒旦崇拜邪教
It's a Satanist cult.

514
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,520
过去犯下过很多祭祀性凶杀案
Committed a string of ritual murders.

515
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,720
可是他们已经沉寂十余年了
But they haven't been active for a decade or more.

516
00:27:58,390 --> 00:27:59,810
看来他们回来了
I guess they're back.

517
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,550
不
No.

518
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,150
我不这么认为
No, I don't think so.

519
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,470
警司  给我找几个巡警
Hey, Sarge, I'm gonna need a couple of mobile units

520
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,690
去帮我带几个人回局里
to pick some people up.

521
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,690
听着  务必谨慎对待
But listen... they need careful handling.

522
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,270
长官  他们在3号室和4号室
Sir, they're in three and four.

523
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,560
谢了  齐克  他们都不知道
Thanks, Zeke. Neither of them knows

524
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,440
对方也在这里  对吧
the other one's here, right?

525
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,570
对  如你吩咐的
Right, like you said.

526
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,350
干得好
Ah, good work.

527
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,030
记住  也许你的想法
Just bear in mind that you could be wrong

528
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,280
-都是错的  -我会记住的
- about all of this. - I will bear it in mind.

529
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,020
我会的  但是我没错
I will, but I'm not wrong.

530
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,410
回家去吧  女士
So go on home now, lady.

531
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,660
当时我们正在共度美好的夜晚
We were having a perfectly lovely evening.

532
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,240
想出门寻找
I am not the one who wanted

533
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,660
撒旦崇拜短柄斧的人可不是我
to go out searching for Satanist hatchets.

534
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,100
你明知道我想做什么
You... know what I wanted to do.

535
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,370
你说得对
You're right.

536
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,690
什么  你说什么
Uh-huh. I'm sorry, what?

537
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,600
我经常热心过度
I tend to get overly enthusiastic about things.

538
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,460
这是我的问题
It's an issue for me.

539
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,750
我妈常说...
My mom always said...

540
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,250
谁管我妈说了什么呢
Oh, who gives a crap what my mom said, right?

541
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,780
晚上愉快  吉姆
Have a good night, Jim.

542
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,490
回头把结果告诉我
Let me know how it all turns out.

543
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,830
再见  小莱
Good night, Lee.

544
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,910
等等
Wait!

545
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,600
你之前的话
What you said earlier,

546
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,990
说我虚伪  还有关于分享生活
about hypocrisy, sharing lives...

547
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,370
你说得对  我们走吧
You're right. Let's go.

548
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,710
我什么
I'm what?

549
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,590
说对了
Right.

550
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,660
晚上好  西瑟罗先生
Good evening, Mr. Cicero.

551
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,780
抱歉这么晚叫您来
Sorry to bring you down here so late.

552
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,680
晚上好  戈登警探
Good evening, Detective Gordon;

553
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,250
还有汤普金斯医生
Dr. Thompkins.

554
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,340
你怎么...
How did you...

555
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,730
他闻到你香水了
He smells your perfume.

556
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,620
我们破解了莱拉给你捎的话
We solved the message Lila sent you.

557
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,440
我们按线索去了阿卡姆大桥公园
Took us to Arkham Bridge Park.

558
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,160
在那里发现了一把短柄斧
We found a hatchet there

559
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,070
上面刻了撒旦标记
with Satanist symbols scratched into it.

560
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,380
天呐
Dear lord.

561
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,730
你知道那把斧子意味着什么吗  西瑟罗先生
You know what that hatchet means, Mr. Cicero?

562
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
说说吧
Tell me.

563
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,930
意味着你是谋杀从犯
It means you're an accessory to murder.

564
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,450
这么夸张
Such drama.

565
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,280
我不过是捎了个信
I merely passed along a message.

566
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,630
死人捎来的信
A message from the dead.

567
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,960
根本没那回事
Didn't happen.

568
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,740
所以  那个讯息是你编的
Which means you invented the message...

569
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,870
所以  你找人去留下把斧子让我们找到
which means you had someone plant the hatchet for us to find.

570
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,180
你想让我们以为
You wanted us to think

571
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,700
是撒旦崇拜者杀害了莱拉
Satanist were responsible for Lila's death.

572
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,440
你在保护一个人
You're protecting somebody.

573
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,720
莱拉给我托话了
Lila spoke to me.

574
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,730
就是这样
That's all.

575
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,840
知道吗
You know,

576
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,120
短柄斧是个拙劣的计谋
a hatchet is a clumsy ploy.

577
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,470
你能这么做也是别无选择
You wouldn't try it unless you were desperate.

578
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,880
所以你一定是在保护一个亲近的人
Which suggests you're protecting someone close.

579
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,680
你爱的人
Someone you love.

580
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,110
这个幻想
This fantasia

581
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,350
不过是你狭隘的头脑编出来的
was conjured in your blinkered mind.

582
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,150
如果你能有我的视界
If you could only see what I see...

583
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,380
你好啊  杰罗姆
Hi, Jerome.

584
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,220
请坐
Please. Take a seat.

585
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,310
你认识西瑟罗先生的  是剧团的人
You know Mr. Cicero, from the show.

586
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,890
是  警官
Yes, sir.

587
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,190
你好  西瑟罗先生
Hello, Mr. Cicero.

588
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,890
晚上好  杰罗姆
Good evening, Jerome.

589
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,860
知道为什么叫你来吗
Do you know why you're here?

590
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,170
你查明是谁杀了我母亲吗
Did you find out who killed my mother?

591
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,720
是你杀了你母亲  杰罗姆
You killed your mother, Jerome.

592
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,580
我
Me?

593
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,340
你在山上杀了她
You killed her up on that hill

594
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,870
西瑟罗先生让你去他拖车上收拾干净
and Mr. Cicero let you clean up in his trailer.

595
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,570
他叫你在短柄斧上留下撒旦标记
He told you to scratch the Satanist stuff on the hatchet

596
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,800
然后扔下桥
and throw it off the bridge.

597
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,640
警官  这太荒谬了
Sir, that's... absurd and...

598
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,060
而且很过分
and offensive.

599
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,260
事实就是如此
But it's the truth.

600
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,850
但我不知道此人为什么如此冒险帮你
What I don't know is why this man risked so much to help you.

601
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,230
我认为他是你父亲
I think he's your father.

602
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,270
你在胡说
You don't know what you're talking about.

603
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,430
我父亲是位船长
My father was a sea captain.

604
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,420
我说错了吗  西瑟罗先生
Am I wrong, Mr. Cicero?

605
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,260
错了
Yes.

606
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,650
他是个船长
He was a sea captain.

607
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,460
他叫斯文・卡尔森  他死在了海上
His name was Sven Karlsen. He died at sea.

608
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,310
那艘船叫什么
What was the name of his ship?

609
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,830
他在很多船上干过活儿
He worked on a lot of different ships.

610
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,710
跟他一起沉没的那艘呢
The one he went down in.

611
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,430
她没说过
She never said.

612
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,700
我们可以做血检证实一下
We can do a blood test to prove I'm right.

613
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,250
一小时内就能拿到准确结果
It takes only half an hour to get a foolproof result.

614
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,880
是不是  汤普金斯医生
Isn't that right, Dr. Thompkins?

615
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,690
是的
Yes.

616
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,390
别去挨那一针了
Save yourself a needle.

617
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,830
我的确讨厌扎针
I do hate needles.

618
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,720
对不起  杰罗姆
I'm sorry, Jerome.

619
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,970
你在说什么呢
What are you talking about?

620
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,830
他说得对
He's right.

621
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,140
我是你父亲
I am your father.

622
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,290
不  你不是  你为什么这么说
No, you're not. Why would you say that?

623
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,580
你一定也有所怀疑
You must have suspected the truth.

624
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,980
你不是我父亲  我母亲绝不会
You're not my father. My mother would never...

625
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,790
你母亲是个冷酷的女人
Your mother was a cruel woman;

626
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,020
她对我经常很刻薄
she was often unkind to me,

627
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,590
但她曾爱过我
but she did once love me,

628
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,710
以她的方式
in her way.

629
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,060
她也很爱你
And she loved you very much.

630
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,880
所以她给你编造了一个更好的父亲
That's why she gave you a better father.

631
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,090
我母亲
My mother

632
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,010
是个冷血的婊子
was a cold-hearted whore

633
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,730
她从未爱过任何人
who never loved anyone.

634
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,210
她才不会
And she'd never touch

635
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:45,000
碰你这样可悲的老变态呢
a pathetic old creep like you.

636
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,730
这些年来
All these years,

637
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,650
你以为我是好心
do you think I was kind to you

638
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,500
才对你那么好的吗
because I'm such a good man?

639
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,600
如果我不是你父亲
If I wasn't your father,

640
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,390
怎么会得知你做了那种事  还那么帮你
would I help you as I have, after what you did?

641
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,180
我父亲
My father...

642
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,340
真没想到
I'll be damned.

643
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,180
真是好笑啊
Oh, that's very funny.

644
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,560
看来那婊子到底震惊了我一把
Looks like the bitch got me with a zinger in the end.

645
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,950
你为什么杀你母亲  杰罗姆
Why did you kill your mother, Jerome?

646
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,410
你也知道母亲都什么德行
Oh, you know how mothers are.

647
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,980
她就是一直逼我
She just kept pushing.

648
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,640
我心想  好啊  老妈
And I'm like, fine, Mom.

649
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,870
当你的婊子去吧
Be a whore.

650
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,220
当个酒鬼婊子吧
Be a drunken whore, even.

651
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,760
但别当个
But don't be

652
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,200
唠唠叨叨的酒鬼婊子
a nagging drunken whore.

653
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,790
明白吗
You know?

654
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,770
别跑来吼我
Don't come yell at me

655
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,380
叫我洗盘子
to do the dishes

656
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,690
你还一直在隔壁屋里上小丑呢
if you've been banging a clown in the next room!

657
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,320
懂吗
You know?

658
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,290
累了吧
Long night, huh?

659
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,840
居然闹得这么难看
Guess it got kind of ugly.

660
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,820
是啊
Yes, it did.

661
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,320
你没事吧
You okay?

662
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,620
我没事
I'm good.

663
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,180
真的
Truly.

664
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,680
虽然很不堪  但也很刺激
It was ugly, but it was also kind of thrilling.

665
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,330
刺激
Thrilling?

666
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,840
刺激  吓人
Thrilling and scary.

667
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,540
就像往一个很深很黑的隧道里看
Like-like looking down a deep, dark tunnel.

668
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,230
谢谢你让我参与
Thanks for letting me be there.

669
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,390
你真是个不寻常的女人
You are an unusual woman.

670
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,210
你就是认识的女人太少罢了
You just don't know many women.

671
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,800
我们能回家了吗
Can we go home now?

672
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,960
你好啊  企鹅
Hello, Penguin.

673
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,570
维克多
Victor.

674
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,180
你能来真好
How nice.

675
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,180
法尔科内阁下觉得你没弄好
Don Falcone thinks you're messing up.

676
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,400
你不会经营夜店
You don't know how to run a club.

677
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,750
你的营业额
Your numbers...

678
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,270
很糟糕
stink.

679
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,110
恕我直言
With all due respect...

680
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,570
我不是来跟你废话的
I didn't come here to talk.

681
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
有点礼貌死不了人
Good manners cost nothing, you know?

682
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,250
放松
Relax.

683
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,140
他不会伤人
He's harmless.

684
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,350
打招呼  布奇
Say hi, Butch.

685
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,000
法尔科内不想丢掉他
Falcone didn't want to throw him away,

686
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,330
所以我在地下室里调教了他几周
so I worked on him in my basement for a couple of weeks.

687
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,550
他已经焕然一新了
He's a whole new man.

688
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,390
是吧  布奇
Right, Butch?

689
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,210
是  萨斯先生

他会帮你的

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,140
但他...
But he's...

693
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,170
他是布奇・吉尔兹
He's Butch Gilzean.

694
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,980
他忠于菲什・穆尼
He's loyal to Fish Mooney.

695
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,350
他会...
And he'll do...

696
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,870
对你言听计从
exactly what you say.

697
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,820
真的
Really?

698
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,060
真的
Really.

699
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,730
布奇
Hey, Butch,

700
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,020
给我跳支舞
dance for me.

701
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,560
我干得不错吧

702

703

708
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:39,590
当然

709
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,070
这毕竟是你的公司
It's your company, after all.

710
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,560
问吧  年轻人
Fire away, young man.

711
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,230

阿卡姆项目与黑帮的关联

713
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:51,480
以及下属公司韦赞制药的化学武器制造

我们想谢谢你

717
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,320
如果不是你破了莱拉的案子
If you hadn't figure out who killed Lila

718
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,470
还劝我们明白事理
and talked to sense to us the way you did,

719
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,310
我们两家绝不会和解
our families never would have reconciled,

720
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,150
我们也不能在一起了
and we could've never gotten together.

721
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,100
只是尽职而已
Just doing my job.

722
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,480
如果我们生了儿子  就叫他戈登
Hey, if we have a son, we'll name him Gordon.

723
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,120
这个...
Well...

724
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,940
再议吧
we'll discuss that,

725
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,790
但我们真的很感激
but we're certainly very grateful.

726
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:21,870
不客气

怎么这么开心

728
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,580
群众满意嘛
Happy customers.

729
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,590
才不是为这个
That's not it.

730
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,760
是别的
It's something else.

731
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,820
你昨晚啪啪了吧
You got laid, didn't you?

732
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:41,710
你厉害
That's impressive.

733
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,220
你在没有剃须刀的地方过夜了
You slept somewhere without razors

734
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,120
还一身女人香皂味儿
and you smell like ladies' soap.

735
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,390
简单
Easy catch.

736
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,390
我只能认为
I can only conclude

737
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,350
韦恩集团内部高层人物或团体
that high-level individuals or groups within Wayne Enterprises

738
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,670
与人勾结  参与了腐败  受贿  敲诈
have colluded in corruption, bribery, racketeering,

739
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,730
和不道德的医疗研究
and unethical medical research.

740
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,020
多谢你发表意见  布鲁斯
Thank you for that input, Bruce.

741
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,390
如果这些令人震惊的传闻或谣言
I'm so sorry if you've been alarmed or upset

742
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,100
令你担忧或难过了
by these shocking stories and rumors

743
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,450
那我很抱歉
you've been exposed to.

744
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,580
这并非仅仅是谣言
These are much more than rumors.

745
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,340
我们会全面彻底地调查的
We'll look into them thoroughly and carefully, of course.

746
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,140
但是  布鲁斯  老实说
Bruce, let's be fair.

747
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,550
你没给出任何实质性的证据
You've told us nothing with any substantive proof behind it.

748
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,630
我还有所保留
I haven't told you all I know.

749
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,400
是吗
No?

750
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,760
还有什么
What else is there?

751
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,850
我希望你真能仔细进行调查
I hope you do look closely into these issues.

752
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,060
因为下次股东大会上  我会提起此事
Because I'll be raising them at the next shareholders' meeting

753
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,910
并考虑采取法律行动
with a view to possible legal action.

754
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,690
天啊
Dear me.

755
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,300
法律行动
Legal action?

756
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,660
你这么年轻  不适合这么深的浑水吧
These are all very deep waters for such a young man.

757
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,630
我的年龄与此无关
My youth is not relevant.

758
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,660
但如果我成年了
Except that if I were a man,

759
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,880
我就会是董事会的主席
I would be chairing this board.

760
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,460
而我一定会保证韦恩集团不干见不得人的勾当
And I would be sure that Wayne Enterprises was run honestly.

761
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,220
谢谢各位前来

762
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,260

00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,190

卸下沉甸甸的装备
take off that heavy gear

773
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,460
放松一下吧
