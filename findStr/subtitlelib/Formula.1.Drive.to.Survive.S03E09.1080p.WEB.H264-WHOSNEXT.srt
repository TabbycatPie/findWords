1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,360
They always say
sportsmen die twice.

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,360
Once when you lose your career

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,800
and then once at the actual end.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,440
<i>We're in the Middle East.
It is the Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
<i>The lights are shining
down on the circuit, over 500 floodlights.</i>

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,800
<i>A double-header in
the desert. Two races over two weekends.</i>

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,000
Coming into Bahrain,
there's quite a bit at stake.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,400
<i>A big weekend for many drivers,</i>

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,680
<i>who come into this race uncertain
of their futures in the sport.</i>

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,720
Just a reminder about the track limits.

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
Think you'll be here next year?

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Don't know.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,720
I know what I need to do.
I want that seat more than anyone.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,560
Just a couple of last-minute reminders.
The wind has picked up a bit.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,880
Formula 1, it's been my life

16
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,920
for many years.

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,560
But it's not over.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,280
57-lap race, yeah.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,000
Easy to overtake. High tire degradation.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,320
After ten years in the sport,
I don't want to have any regrets.

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,920
I believe, if I can do well,

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,000
I have a chance
to be in Formula 1 next year.

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,000
<i>Twenty seconds. Twenty seconds.</i>

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,040
There's no secret
how much I want to stay here.

25
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,120
<i>Ten seconds. Ten seconds.</i>

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,320
Maybe we're not finished.

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,200
Anything can happen.

28
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,440
<i>Hamilton gets away well,
Verstappen off the line well,</i>

29
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,040
<i>and Pérez coming up
on the inside of Verstappen</i>

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
<i>who is now in second place.</i>

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,040
<i>And there's Alex Albon.</i>

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,720
<i>He's wheel to wheel with Valtteri Bottas
as they file their way through.</i>

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Fuck.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,440
<i>Red flag.
There's a big incident. Red flag.</i>

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,040
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,480
This... this was a big one.
This was a big one.

37
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,440
Who is it? Has he got out?

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,920
<i>No information on it yet.</i>

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,920
<i>Looked like a very, very nasty crash.</i>

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,160
<i>So, we just wait</i>

41
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,080
<i>for any news whatsoever.</i>

42
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,080
Okay. Three, two, uh, one.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,520
Just this morning,
the Haas F1 team announced

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,320
that both of their drivers
would be leaving the team

45
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
at the end of the season.

46
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,680
- I'm so pissed off.
- Yeah, it's fucked up.

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,360
How did they take the news?

48
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,360
Uh, uh, they, you know, they...

49
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,600
I mean,
they were very professional about it.

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,400
Romain, talk to us
about the future, if you would.

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,840
It's bloody difficult
to find a seat for 2021

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,920
when you are let go that late in 2020.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,120
It's gonna be tough.

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,160
So, it seems
to be managed pretty good, you know?

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,000
Letting people go is never easy,
but, uh, all good things have, uh, an end.

56
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,320
Uh, GPS.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,040
Uh, getting it now.
It doesn't know where we are.

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,880
Right.

59
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,720
12:19 arrival, allegedly, mate.
Let's see what you can do.

60
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm gonna say 12:24.

61
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,640
I'm gonna say

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,080
F-U-C-K you.

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,920
<i>The race is on,
or rather, it's soon to be off</i>

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
<i>for Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.</i>

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,080
I<i>t's potentially the end of F1
for Grosjean.</i>

66
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,000
Bullshit!

67
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,720
- <i>It is. Um, unfulfilled poten...</i>
- Yeah...

68
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Bit of a strange feeling,

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,520
uh, just because I've been spending
five years with Haas.

70
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,376
<i>- Grosjean comesfourth.</i>
- Amazing.

71
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,640
I've put a lot of effort
and passion into the team.

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
I always pushed for us to do better.

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
<i>Grosjean is having issues
with his car.</i>

74
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,560
Just call him in.
End this fucking pain, you know?

75
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,800
Fucking hell.

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,960
There's a lot I can accept, but not this.

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,400
So, to be let go at the end of the year,

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
it hurt me a little bit.

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Ah, this is beautiful.

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,640
But right now, it's relax,
breathe and cool down and focus again.

81
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
How does it feel?

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
- Not too bad.
- Yeah.

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,640
Here he goes.

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,320
After ten years in the sport,

85
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,920
retirement, it's a conversation I had
with my wife, my family and my kids.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,920
They know the risk of Formula 1,

87
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,160
but I told them
if there is an opportunity to carry on,

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,640
I'm gonna jump on it.

89
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,320
Stopping is not an option.

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,760
Yeah!

91
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,680
It's incredibly hard for drivers

92
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,800
who've spent their entire lives
trying to be in Formula 1,

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,320
leaving that is almost like
stepping away from an addiction.

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,560
There we go.

95
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,760
Romain's a racer.

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,280
He doesn't want to leave Formula 1,

97
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,160
but he's left without a race seat in 2021.

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,120
And right now, he's not the only one.

99
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,240
<i>This is the Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>

100
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
<i>The first of its kind,
a double-header in Bahrain</i>

101
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,160
<i>as two races are held here back-to-back</i>

102
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,720
<i>over two weekends.</i>

103
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,200
No news. I can't find a team.

104
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,440
<i>It's a big couple of races
for many of the teams</i>

105
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,680
<i>and especially for numerous drivers</i>

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,680
<i>who come here uncertain of their futures.</i>

107
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,080
Now, at least, the news is out
and we can get on with it.

108
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,000
- Hi, guys.
- Well, Checo.

109
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,200
Uh, big news, uh,
regarding you, obviously.

110
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,880
From what the team said,
was there anything to prepare you

111
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,000
for what we now know is going to happen?

112
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,120
No. All the feedback I was getting
was that we all wanted to continue,

113
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
so, uh, there was nothing
to prepare me, really.

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,040
At no point
I felt my seat was at a real risk

115
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,040
because the feedback
that I got from Otmar...

116
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,880
I don't like
to talk about contractual stuff.

117
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,680
...was that they wanted to continue with me,

118
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,640
and then very late,
we found out that that wasn't the case.

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,840
I was extremely disappointed.

120
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,080
It could have been handled a bit better.

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
You got your guy.

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,000
Four-time world champion on the team.
You must be thrilled.

123
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,880
We really look forward
to working with Sebastian.

124
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,800
It was not an easy decision.

125
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,640
Checo's done a great job for us,

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,960
but when Seb became available,
we thought it was, uh, a good match.

127
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,760
How are you gonna approach things?

128
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,720
Obviously, the season
is coming to an end soon,

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,280
so very soon,
I will know what the future holds for me.

130
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,096
- Thanks.
- Thanks very much. Good luck!

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
Poor kid.

132
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,920
Feel sorry for him.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,080
That was pretty hard
for me personally, to take that decision

134
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,600
because I felt the decision
had nothing to do with performance.

135
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,400
It's a crazy world.
You haven't got a team.

136
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,600
You know
that there are not many vacancies.

137
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
Checo's had, uh,
an unbelievable year.

138
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,360
In what could be
his best ever season in Formula 1,

139
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,080
he's left potentially with nothing.

140
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,640
I think this
is a situation that's out of my hands.

141
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
Let's see.

142
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
Let me put this over your head.

143
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
I want to carry on.
I don't know anything else.

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,880
I've never done anything else.

145
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Yeah.

146
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Last one.

147
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,160
Relax.

148
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,600
Hold it.

149
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,520
Get up.

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,360
Weekend after weekend,
I think I... I've delivered.

151
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,080
I hope now, you know, the team can see
that I've maximized my opportunities

152
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,200
with the car that I've been given.

153
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,360
What comes next, I don't know.

154
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,040
Anything could happen.

155
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
<i>Hello, welcome to Free Practice.</i>

156
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,440
<i>The sun is set,</i>

157
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,320
<i>so conditions are as they will be
for the race</i>,

158
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
<i>and this is the session
that really counts.</i>

159
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,360
<i>It's the one that you can get
all of the data and information</i>

160
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,320
<i>to prepare for the race.</i>

161
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,280
<i>This is Grosjean's first practice lap
in the Haas.</i>

162
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,320
<i>Gap ahead to Hamilton 8 seconds.
That's a good gap.</i>

163
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,160
Okay.

164
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,280
<i>He's looking to push hard,
but difficult to do much with that car.</i>

165
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,320
<i>Press oil pump button.
Press oil pump button.</i>

166
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,320
<i>Sergio Pérez
in the Racing Point out on track.</i>

167
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
<i>Keep pushing, Checo. One more lap.</i>

168
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
Keep pushing.

169
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,640
<i>Pérez is gonna go
to the top of the times here.</i>

170
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,960
<i>Out onto the start-finish straight.</i>

171
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,720
- How is the pace?
<i>- Very good, Checo.</i>

172
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,840
<i>Best...</i>

173
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
<i>Well done.</i>

174
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,640
<i>Albon on a reasonable lap
coming into the final corner.</i>

175
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,560
<i>What do you think
about the tires so far?</i>

176
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,120
They just lose so much front grip
on the second push.

177
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
<i>Albon,</i>

178
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,760
<i>another driver who may be wondering
where he will be next year.</i>

179
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,960
<i>His performances in the Red Bull
have repeatedly come under the microscope.</i>

180
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,440
<i>And that's a big hit
for Albon on the exit of the final turn.</i>

181
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,720
<i>The Red Bull's ruined.</i>

182
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,000
Brutal.

183
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,400
Fucking brutal.

184
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Sorry, guys.

185
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,000
<i>That's a disaster for Albon,</i>

186
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,200
<i>when he's already under pressure
for his seat.</i>

187
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,200
Frustrating. Frustrating.

188
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,576
<i>That's a huge repair job
for the mechanics.</i>

189
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,920
<i>To get that ready for qualifying tomorrow,
that will be an all-nighter.</i>

190
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,920
He just needs
to have a straightforward weekend.

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,440
I can't remember him
qualifying fourth, fifth,

192
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,560
getting a decent start,
just a smooth weekend.

193
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,760
The situation with Alex is very clear.

194
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,920
I think every single member of this team
wants to see him succeed.

195
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,720
He's aware, you know, that...

196
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,360
he needs to step it up.

197
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,280
The problem is if he doesn't,

198
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,160
there are gonna be
some difficult decisions to be made.

199
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,400
Should've pulled out of it.
I was a bit surprised by the lack of grip.

200
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,960
I know there's always gonna be pressure
on the second seat at Red Bull.

201
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,400
All I know is
that I've got two races to show them...

202
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,640
...you know, that I can do this.

203
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,440
Checo.

204
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,520
Shaping up
to be another good weekend for you.

205
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,480
Great performance.

206
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,480
Your race pace got the big boys worried.

207
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,520
Mercedes, Red Bull,
they're all looking at you.

208
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,960
- They know you can be a contender.
- Uh...

209
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
...I think they're a step too far.

210
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,960
I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't explore all options.

211
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,760
Sergio has done such a great job this year

212
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,120
that you couldn't fail to recognize that.

213
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
How would a dark blue
racing suit suit you with Red Bulls on it?

214
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,360
It's, uh...
Yeah, I think it would look nice.

215
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,520
I already have a bit of blue.

216
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Thank you, mate.

217
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,880
He's over delivered.

218
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,800
And, uh, as a result,

219
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,640
you know,
he's put himself on the... on the radar.

220
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,200
<i>The sun has gone to bed,
the moon is out in the desert.</i>

221
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,360
<i>This is the Bahrain Grand Prix,</i>

222
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,400
<i>round 15
of the Formula 1 World Championship.</i>

223
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,080
<i>The first of two races held right here</i>

224
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,360
<i>in the Bahrain double-header
over the next two weekends.</i>

225
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,400
In Formula 1,
you always think about your future.

226
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,320
Fifty-seven-lap race, yeah.

227
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,720
I want to do the maximum.

228
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,320
You don't want
to be driving too cautiously.

229
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm just gonna go
and drive the way I like it.

230
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,960
<i>Hamilton starts
in pole position,</i>

231
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,200
<i>his 98th pole of his career,
with Bottas alongside him,</i>

232
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,600
<i>then in third, Max Verstappen
in the Red Bull.</i>

233
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,080
<i>Alex Albon,
after his accident during practice,</i>

234
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,080
<i>he pulled off a terrific qualifying round.</i>

235
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,040
<i>He starts fourth on the grid,
one ahead of Pérez.</i>

236
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,616
I'm actually approaching
the last three races

237
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,640
as my final races in Formula 1
because I don't know what will happen.

238
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,720
In life, you get certain opportunities.
You just have to maximize all of them.

239
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,280
Whatever comes, I'm just ready for it.

240
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,440
<i>Twenty seconds. Twenty seconds.</i>

241
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,936
<i>All the mechanics
and engineers in the garage</i>

242
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,480
<i>starting to get on their feet</i>

243
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,840
<i>and watch what is about to unfold
at the start of this Grand Prix.</i>

244
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,640
<i>When you arrive at the back
of the grid, one static bite point.</i>

245
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
<i>Okay.</i>

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,120
<i>Radio check now, Checo, radio check.</i>

247
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Copy.

248
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,400
<i>Here come the lights.</i>

249
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,200
<i>Hamilton gets away well,
Verstappen off the line well,</i>

250
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,680
<i>Pérez coming up on the inside
of Verstappen who is now in second place.</i>

251
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
<i>Tires are good, Checo.
Just wanna keep this.</i>

252
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
Let's focus now.

253
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,320
<i>Towards the back,
Grosjean has already gained two places</i>

254
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
<i>coming out of turn one.</i>

255
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,120
<i>Alex Albon in fourth
trying to keep up with Sergio Pérez</i>

256
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,240
<i>as he speeds into the distance ahead</i>.

257
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,160
<i>Grosjean still making moves
to try and gain places.</i>

258
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,440
Fuck.

259
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,280
Oh my God!

260
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,520
What the fuck happened there?
Fucking get him out!

261
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,920
Who was that?

262
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,560
<i>I think that's Grosjean
that has gone into the barriers there.</i>

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,080
<i>About 140 miles an hour.</i>

264
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,160
- What the fuck was that?
- Eh?

265
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,360
They need
to get the fuck out. Quick.

266
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,000
<i>Red flag. Red flag.
There's a big incident. Red flag.</i>

267
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,536
- Copy.
<i>- Slow down, please.</i>

268
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,880
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

269
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,400
This... this was a big one.
This was a big one.

270
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,360
Is he okay?

271
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,800
<i>I will come back to you.</i>

272
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,560
No, please.

273
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,160
Ah, fuck.

274
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Has he got out?

275
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
<i>No information on it yet.</i>

276
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,920
Shit. Is he... Is he okay?

277
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,600
<i>Come into the pit lane.</i>

278
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,400
Oh, tell me he's okay.
Please tell me he's okay.

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,800
There are certain moments
where silence falls on a racing track

280
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,680
and you know what that means.

281
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,160
You cannot do anything.
You're just a passenger to this.

282
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,120
The world seems to be coming down on you.

283
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,240
Once you see fire,
that's the worst thing you can have.

284
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,360
This is bad.

285
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,280
Yeah, this one was hard to watch.

286
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,600
I felt very, very vulnerable
in that moment.

287
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,960
Everything goes
through your head.

288
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,520
You don't think that anybody
can get out alive of this one.

289
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,280
I've been doing racing
long enough. There is no good outcome.

290
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
He's not coming out.

291
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,960
The longer you sit and you wait,
the more...

292
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,040
the fear kicks in
because your instincts are...

293
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,200
that you know what the reality is.

294
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,200
When I saw the fireball,
I couldn't believe this could happen

295
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,920
in modern Formula 1 cars.

296
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
And a car shouldn't break in two.

297
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,320
Only when you see those things
do you believe the danger that we go into.

298
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,320
The big question was

299
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
where's... where's the rest of the car
and where is the driver?

300
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,200
I did think
that it would be a very bad outcome.

301
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,240
As I looked to my right,

302
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,440
I could see, uh, the driver

303
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,600
through the... the gap in the flame.

304
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,400
Not only has he survived
going through a barrier,

305
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,680
at 160 miles an hour,

306
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,400
with... within a ball of fire...

307
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,560
The heat must have been so extreme.

308
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,240
It was a miracle.
It was absolutely a miracle.

309
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,640
He wanted to walk to the ambulance,

310
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,240
and I was insisting, "No, no, no, no,
we'll get the ambulance here,"

311
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,200
but he wanted to demonstrate
that he was okay.

312
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,760
He got a message to everyone,
his wife and family in particular,

313
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,360
that he was out
and he was in a good place.

314
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,520
How the fuck
did he come out of that?

315
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,680
H... ho... how did he jump out?

316
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,760
That's... that's an act of God.

317
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,920
He's on his way to hospital
to get checked out,

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,800
but, uh, he's completely conscious.

319
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,360
He had, what I was told,
minor burns on his hands on his feet.

320
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,960
He's... he... he's okay.

321
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,880
They did a fantastic job to get him away
as quick as possible from the fire.

322
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,920
It was amazing, uh, what they did
and thank you a lot to them.

323
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,960
Thanks for your time, Guenther.

324
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,400
I need to find out
who was in that rescue car.

325
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,760
Fucking hell, they've done a great job.
The guy with the extinguisher.

326
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,640
- I just want to...
- Absolutely.

327
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,680
- I need to find out who it was.
- Okay.

328
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,080
He got lucky today.

329
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,400
He got away with it.

330
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Just have to say thank you
to somebody up in heaven.

331
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,080
<i>It does look as if this race will restart</i>,

332
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,640
<i>and for those drivers,</i>

333
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,520
<i>they now have to somehow
get back in their cars</i>

334
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,800
<i>and drive as if nothing has happened.</i>

335
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,920
On those occasions,
you have to be really strong.

336
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,760
You have to disconnect from that,
don't think about Romain anymore.

337
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,320
Focus on... on what you are about to do

338
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,080
and then back in the car
and go through it again.

339
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,240
You have to compartmentalize it somehow.

340
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,000
You make a decision,
"I'm going to continue, yep,"

341
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,560
and you just keep going.

342
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,160
It's just the wild desire
to drive these cars on the limit

343
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,560
and nothing's gonna change that.

344
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,160
We are different.
We are Formula 1 drivers. We are...

345
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,360
We are crazy people.

346
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,280
<i>Lights out and away we go.</i>

347
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,480
<i>Sergio Pérez
and Max Verstappen on the inside.</i>

348
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,000
<i>Verstappen slips past the Racing Point.</i>

349
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,120
<i>Albon fancied a run
around the outside of the Mercedes.</i>

350
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>Bottas was having none of it.</i>

351
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,240
<i>We have got an incident at the back there.</i>

352
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,080
<i>Lance Stroll's Racing Point.</i>

353
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,040
<i>Racing Point can ill afford
an incident like that</i>

354
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,280
<i>for the Constructors' Championship.</i>

355
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,080
<i>With Lance Stroll out,
it's down to Sergio Pérez,</i>

356
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,400
<i>the man without a contract next season,</i>

357
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,160
<i>to win points for the team
that are letting him go.</i>

358
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,480
<i>So, unfortunately, Lance is out,
but he is okay.</i>

359
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,440
<i>Checo, we need maximum pace now, please.
Maximum pace. Stay positive.</i>

360
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,080
<i>As if the pressure
on Pérez isn't enough already.</i>

361
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,480
<i>Checo, the car behind is now Albon.</i>

362
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,560
<i>DRS is enabled. DRS is enabled.</i>

363
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,800
<i>Here comes Sergio Pérez.</i>

364
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,720
<i>Flying past and overtaking Pierre Gasly.</i>

365
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,320
What's the gap?

366
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,600
<i>Two tenths quicker than Albon.</i>

367
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,360
<i>Okay, Alex, Pérez ahead.
Let's have him.</i>

368
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
Yeah, I'm trying.

369
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,640
<i>Pérez passes Sainz
to get into third place.</i>

370
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,040
<i>Can he bag himself a podium</i>

371
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,600
<i>and stay ahead of Alex Albon
in the Red Bull just behind him?</i>

372
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,440
<i>Pérez, once again,
has put in a super performance.</i>

373
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,320
<i>Last two laps,
two tenths quicker than Albon.</i>

374
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,480
<i>Your lap time
is getting closer to Verstappen's.</i>

375
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,640
<i>Only three laps left
for Pérez in this race.</i>

376
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm losing power. Losing power.

377
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,360
I cannot continue this pace
for the other laps.

378
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,160
Not coming back.

379
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,200
<i>Is that smoke?</i>

380
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,160
<i>That's Sergio Pérez
going slowly down the main straight.</i>

381
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,320
<i>Alex Albon
can literally smell third place.</i>

382
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,600
<i>Be careful in braking zones.</i>

383
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,040
<i>There's obviously a lot of oil coming out,
now he's on fire.</i>

384
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,920
<i>Checo, stop the car,
please, stop the car.</i>

385
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,080
<i>It's on fire.</i>

386
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
<i>What a time for Albon
to inherit third place</i>

387
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,680
<i>for his second podium in Formula 1.</i>

388
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,160
- Okay, we should be good now.
<i>- Nice job. Keep pushing.</i>

389
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,400
<i>Lewis Hamilton has come through</i>

390
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,800
<i>to win the Bahrain Grand Prix.</i>

391
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,920
<i>And there's Alex Albon
across the line in third place,</i>

392
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,400
<i>and a much-needed podium.</i>

393
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,680
<i>That will surely
put him in a firm position</i>

394
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,120
<i>to stay with Red Bull for next year.</i>

395
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,280
- <i>All right, nice job, P3.</i>
- Yeah, thank you, guys.

396
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,960
<i>Red Bull get both drivers
on the podium.</i>

397
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,440
Well done, Alex.
That was a mega job. Good drive.

398
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,760
Good to have you both
up there on the podium.

399
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,400
Thanks, Christian.

400
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,000
<i>Sergio Pérez
very much deserved that podium.</i>

401
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,320
<i>It's, uh, not to be.</i>

402
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,520
Alby! Alby! Alby! Alby! Alby!

403
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,560
Alex, he really deserves it.

404
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,920
What's impressed me is
when he's had knocks, he's bounced back.

405
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,960
I know there's still work to do.

406
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,200
Of course I wanna stay here,

407
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,160
and to stand on the podium
was... was really special.

408
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,000
<i>Red Bull, uh, with both Max and Alex</i>

409
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
<i>on that podium, uh, this evening.</i>

410
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,680
Yesterday was a sad day for everyone.

411
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,960
I've had a lot of bad luck.

412
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,080
The important thing yesterday

413
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,880
was that Grosjean walked away
from that accident with his life.

414
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,280
It's been an emotional roller coaster.

415
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,480
This is strong.

416
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,880
- This is water.
- Mexican water!

417
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,520
The podium was in the bag
and got away from us.

418
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Yes.

419
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
The podium would've meant a lot,

420
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,440
to remind everyone how good I am,
what I can do in the car.

421
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,280
And it's a big hit.

422
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,960
This game is called Black Widow.

423
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,920
Formula 1, it's been my life

424
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,960
for many, many years.

425
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,560
You don't have to have the best game.
Just make sure that you don't lose.

426
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,960
And now, it looks like I'm leaving
at the end of the year.

427
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,440
It makes me feel very, very sad.

428
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,200
As a Mexican,
it's very hard to get into Formula 1.

429
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,720
...<i>still not enough.
You can see the shadow...</i>

430
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,440
<i>And then you can see Pérez.</i>

431
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,000
<i>That was tight!</i>

432
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,320
<i>Sergio Pérez here, great racing.</i>

433
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,440
<i>He's gonna go on his way now.</i>

434
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,680
You have to leave your country
at a very young age.

435
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,440
You have to sacrifice your childhood,
basically.

436
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,801
Of course,
I will fight for the championship.

437
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,520
At the age of 14,
I went to Germany.

438
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,240
I was on my own
while other kids were with their family.

439
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,960
<i>Amazing, Checo, well done.</i>

440
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,320
What an unbelievable first race
in Formula 1. Sum it up for us.

441
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,800
After ten years in the sport,

442
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,680
it's a bit emotional.

443
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,600
My target is to keep in Formula 1,

444
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,920
but, um, I don't know what will happen.

445
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,240
<i>What a week it's been
in the world of Formula 1</i>

446
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,560
<i>and here we are.</i>

447
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,320
<i>Welcome back to Bahrain.</i>

448
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,600
Hello. Hell... I've got nothing.

449
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,120
- Yep.
- There you go.

450
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,280
<i>There is plenty
to talk about before the second race</i>

451
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,240
<i>in this double-header in the desert.</i>

452
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,080
<i>And obviously,
the latest is Romain Grosjean</i>

453
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,200
<i>who will not be taking part.</i>

454
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,136
- Romain.
- Well done.

455
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,120
- Thank you.
- Good to see you.

456
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,320
- I'm so fucking happy to see you.
- Thank you, my friend.

457
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,856
- Steiner.
- How are you?

458
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
Yeah.

459
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,480
The knee is getting really good.

460
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,360
Ankle also.

461
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,640
And, uh, only question with this one.

462
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,120
They're talking about a graft.

463
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,960
Yeah.

464
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,960
So I say, "Everyone who's gonna
shake my hand's gonna shake my arse!"

465
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,040
But you can laugh at least!
I can still hear the...

466
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,240
...coming up, yeah.

467
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,360
You see it in movies
and think it's not true, it's true.

468
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,680
The hit with the wall wasn't hard.

469
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,160
Uh, it... it's strange because it was 56 Gs

470
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,520
you know, so it means
my body was about 3.9 tonnes.

471
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Uh...

472
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,920
And then I remember opening my eyes
when everything stopped.

473
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,920
And I tried to lift myself
and jump out of the car

474
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,680
and I... I feel that I hit something
on top of my helmet

475
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,440
so I sit back down and I thought,

476
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,480
"Well, I'm upside down,
against the wall or whatever."

477
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,880
"Someone will come and rescue me.
I'll just wait."

478
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,120
Then I look a bit right and a bit left,
and then it's all orange on the left.

479
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,680
Uh, why is it orange? It's not sunset.
Is it the light from the circuit? No.

480
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,440
Oh, it's fire.

481
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,360
I tried to go up, didn't work.
Right didn't work. Left didn't work.

482
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,840
Sit down, try to understand.
Go left, it was twitching a bit, the head.

483
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,000
Okay, it works, but my foot is stuck.

484
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,480
I sit back down and...

485
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,640
there's a time where...

486
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,520
I think, "That is it," you know?

487
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,120
I started asking myself
very simple questions.

488
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,880
"Where am I going to burn first?
Is it going to be painful?"

489
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,840
Few people have known that moment,

490
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,160
uh, where...

491
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,440
you almost accept that you're dead.

492
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,880
Fucking hell, yeah.

493
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,400
How are the kids?

494
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,240
They ask many questions.

495
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,200
Then the kids... kids came in the car.

496
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,920
They said
"No, Daddy, this is not happening."

497
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,280
I said, "No, I cannot finish like this."

498
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,640
"It cannot be... It cannot be the end."

499
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,400
It was like "boom-boom-boom-boom,"
survival instinct.

500
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,000
I put my hands in the fire
and I can feel my hands are burning.

501
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,040
I can see the gloves that are red normally
become completely black

502
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,960
and... and I can feel the pain.

503
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,720
But at that time,
I don't... I don't care, you know?

504
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,560
And when the shoulders are going through,
the doctor pulls on my overall

505
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,600
and... and this is the time
I realized I was alive.

506
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,560
I was going to live.

507
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,200
And that feeling, I think,
will stay in my head forever.

508
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,280
I still can't believe it.

509
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,960
From the moment of the crash

510
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,360
till the moment
that we saw on the TV that he was alive.

511
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,920
Two minutes 45.

512
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,840
I mean, I... Words still fail me.

513
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,880
And the longer it was lasting,

514
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,600
the more I started to believe
that he... he was dead.

515
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
And, um...

516
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,640
Even a few days after that,
our oldest son, Sacha,

517
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,800
he said, "Oh, I was scared
that he would be burned everywhere."

518
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,400
I'm still a racer

519
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,320
and I'll still miss racing
this weekend, but, uh...

520
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:59,520
the priorities that were here last week
are, you know, very different.

521
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,920
It changed my life forever.

522
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,560
- You are the man that crossed the road?
- Yes.

523
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,720
F1 is a job, it's a passion.

524
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,960
Put my parents, my wife, my kids,
my friends through that stress again

525
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,880
if I have a big crash?

526
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,920
I... I don't think I can.

527
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,040
For two minutes 43 seconds,
for them, I was dead.

528
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,800
So yes,
I'm sad about leaving Formula 1, but...

529
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,840
yeah, there is no...
you know, there's no regret.

530
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,120
I think now, it's just...
life will be much more beautiful.

531
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,520
I mean, when you go through that
and you have a second birthday,

532
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,200
a second chance in life,

533
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,720
a chance of life,

534
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,680
uh,

535
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,160
yeah, you... you just take it.

536
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,040
Thank you very much, Romain.

537
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,376
I... I didn't win a race,
I didn't win the championship,

538
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,480
but I will have a legacy forever
in Formula 1.

539
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,680
You know, I...
I'm the man that walked out of fire.

540
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,320
<i>We're under the lights
for the Sakhir Grand Prix this evening</i>

541
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,760
<i>at a brand-new circuit layout.</i>

542
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,160
<i>The outer loop of this Bahrain circuit.</i>

543
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,280
<i>It's never been used before.</i>

544
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,720
Relax. Relax.

545
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
It's been
a difficult year, but it's not over.

546
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,160
Go to the door.

547
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,480
Go on.

548
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,360
Everything remains very strong inside me.

549
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
Ten seconds.

550
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,120
I want to keep going.

551
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,720
Push it, come on.

552
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,456
- I know how good I am.
- Good.

553
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,176
People know what I can do.

554
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,600
Five fast reps.

555
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,160
And I believe that God
has put me in this place for a reason.

556
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,240
Still plenty of things that can happen.

557
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,360
I believe that I can finish on a high.

558
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,320
God knows
I used all my opportunities I've had.

559
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,960
So, whatever comes, I'm just ready for it.

560
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,080
<i>And it's not just a new
track layout in Bahrain this weekend,</i>

561
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,080
<i>but also new dynamics
in the driver lineup.</i>

562
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
<i>Lewis Hamilton is not racing,</i>

563
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,640
<i>having tested positive for COVID-19.</i>

564
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,560
<i>He's replaced by George Russell
on loan from Williams.</i>

565
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,800
<i>And all that means
it's hard to make any predictions.</i>

566
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,080
<i>What unfolds next
is in the lap of the Gods.</i>

567
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,440
<i>The Sakhir Grand Prix is underway.</i>

568
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,960
<i>Sergio Pérez trying to challenge.</i>

569
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,400
<i>Russell takes the lead of the Grand Prix.</i>

570
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,080
<i>Valtteri Bottas is down to second.</i>

571
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,720
<i>Ooh, and he gets all out of shape
coming out of turn two.</i>

572
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,520
<i>That's gonna give Pérez and Verstappen
the impetus they need.</i>

573
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,880
<i>Three wide up towards turn four.</i>

574
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,960
<i>...by Charles Leclerc
and there's three cars gone off.</i>

575
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,600
Fuck's sake!

576
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,520
What happened?

577
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,880
<i>Keep going, Checo, keep going.</i>

578
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,120
<i>That's not just a disaster
for Pérez, but also the team as well.</i>

579
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,960
<i>Racing Point chasing third place
in the championship.</i>

580
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,120
<i>They need points
to keep them in contention</i>

581
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,960
<i>to have their best ever season.</i>

582
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,480
<i>Sergio Pérez
all the way down in 18th place.</i>

583
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,480
Ugh!
I think I had bad... bad luck happen.

584
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,200
<i>Pérez all the way at the back now.</i>

585
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,040
<i>Not how he would've liked to have seen
his season, and his Formula 1 career,</i>

586
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,360
<i>coming to an end.</i>

587
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Wah!

588
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,720
Let's focus. Sorry. Let's focus now.

589
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,640
Okay, let's get the maximum today.

590
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,720
<i>Sergio Pérez, no longer last</i>

591
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,640
<i>as he overtakes the Alfa Romeo.</i>

592
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,080
<i>Fittipaldi ahead on soft.</i>

593
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,640
- Yes.
- Yes. Come on!

594
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,040
How is the pace right now?

595
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,080
<i>That is good pace, Checo, good pace.</i>

596
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,120
Come on! Come on!

597
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
<i>You're in a good position.
There's a long race ahead.</i>

598
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,320
<i>Next car ahead, Magnussen, also soft.</i>

599
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,360
<i>Pérez may be down,
but he doesn't believe he's out, does he?</i>

600
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,760
<i>Slowly but surely
coming back from last place</i>

601
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,640
<i>to now move into the midfield.</i>

602
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,680
<i>Good, Checo, so next car is Vettel.</i>

603
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,240
<i>Pérez against Vettel,</i>

604
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,560
<i>the guy that's nicked his job
for next year.</i>

605
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Come on!

606
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,800
<i>Pérez now moves up into 11th place.</i>

607
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,960
<i>He'll be in the points before too long,
you' would've thought.</i>

608
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,040
<i>Sergio Pérez gets Norris as well,
using all his years of experience.</i>

609
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,000
<i>- Next car ahead, Albon.</i>
- Copy.

610
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,240
<i>- Checo, this pace is very good.</i>
- We need the points.

611
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,840
<i>I wonder if that duel
will attract the attention</i>

612
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,440
<i>of the Red Bull pit wall.</i>

613
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,640
<i>"I want your place now
and I want your car next year."</i>

614
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,680
<i>This is a key phase. Push.
Keep the pressure on him.</i>

615
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,560
<i>Next car behind you is now Pérez.</i>

616
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,720
<i>Let's push now to pull away.</i>

617
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Go on!

618
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,640
- Go on!
- Fucking hell!

619
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes!

620
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,400
That was close, guys.

621
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,360
He needs a drive, pal.

622
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,640
<i>Pérez takes ninth from Albon.</i>

623
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,600
<i>Checo,
your pace is seriously strong.</i>

624
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,080
<i>Albon behind is dying.</i>

625
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,400
<i>Pérez has come all the way from the back.</i>

626
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,200
<i>to now be level
with teammate Lance Stroll.</i>

627
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,880
<i>Lockup there, by Lance Stroll.</i>

628
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,480
<i>Pérez up into fourth.</i>

629
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,480
<i>Against all the odds,</i>

630
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,840
<i>this could be
a phenomenal result for Pérez,</i>

631
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,160
<i>but also Racing Point,
who now occupy fourth and fifth.</i>

632
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,920
<i>Pérez has been on it
absolutely all day long.</i>

633
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,400
Oh, all right!

634
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,920
<i>Just keep your head down
and try and get Ocon.</i>

635
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,800
<i>Is this gonna be
Pérez's opportunity to get ahead?</i>

636
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,000
Go on, boy! That's it! Go on!

637
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,720
<i>Only the two Mercedes in front of him now.</i>

638
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,280
<i>Into the pits comes Russell
from the race lead.</i>

639
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,120
<i>Overshoots a little, but in he comes
and Mercedes are double stacking here.</i>

640
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,520
<i>It's a slow stop for Bottas.</i>

641
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,000
<i>There's a man waving on the front left.
They can't get the wheel on at all!</i>

642
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,240
<i>Disastrous pit stop for Mercedes.</i>

643
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,880
<i>There's been a big problem
for Bottas ahead.</i>

644
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,240
<i>Bottas is losing position.
Pérez is now second.</i>

645
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,760
Fucking hell!

646
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,640
<i>Now a problem
for the second Mercedes,</i>

647
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,000
<i>driven by George Russell.</i>

648
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,040
<i>Here's Russell's radio.</i>

649
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,960
<i>Okay, George, we need to box.
We have a mixed tire set on the car.</i>

650
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,000
<i>So, they put
the wrong tires on Russell's car.</i>

651
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,200
<i>Russell is going to have to pit again.</i>

652
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,280
<i>Absolute disaster for the Mercedes team.</i>

653
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,680
Come on! Come on!

654
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,760
<i>We are now the lead car.
Russell has also boxed.</i>

655
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,160
<i>Mercedes have dropped an absolute clanger.</i>

656
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,320
<i>Pérez now leading the Grand Prix.</i>

657
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,960
I can hardly speak.

658
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,160
<i>Yes, Checo, this is really good.
Maximum push.</i>

659
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:35,360
<i>Sergio Pérez on the verge
of winning his first ever Grand Prix,</i>

660
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,160
<i>having been in last place
on the opening lap.</i>

661
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,480
<i>And now, we're onto the final lap.</i>

662
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,840
Oh my God!

663
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,120
<i>Pérez,
on his 190th Grand Prix start,</i>

664
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,240
<i>has just half a lap to go.</i>

665
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,520
<i>The man who was
in last place at the end of lap one</i>

666
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,080
<i>comes home to win the Sakhir Grand Prix.</i>

667
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,800
<i>Yes, Checo!</i>

668
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
<i>Sergio Pérez, wow!</i>

669
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,520
<i>Yes, Checo, P1!</i>

670
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,520
<i>Yes!</i>

671
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,120
I'm speechless, guys.

672
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,200
<i>Amazing, Checo, well done.</i>

673
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,880
Checo! Checo! Checo!

674
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,040
- Checo! Checo! Checo!
- Yeah, Checo!

675
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,640
<i>Look at those celebrations.</i>

676
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,080
<i>And it's the first ever double podium
for Racing Point, as well,</i>

677
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,400
<i>as Lance Stroll takes third place.</i>

678
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,880
Checo! Checo! Checo! Checo! Checo! Checo!

679
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,600
<i>Are we really gonna
say goodbye to this driver</i>

680
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,080
<i>at the end of this season?</i>

681
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,560
<i>I... I really hope not.</i>

682
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,080
<i>Sergio Pérez!</i>

683
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,320
<i>Lance Stroll!</i>

684
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,976
Another man
who's heart and soul of this team.

685
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,560
I think that's a tear in your eye,
is it not, Otmar?

686
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,600
No. I'm really, really happy.

687
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,040
I mean, look at Sergio.

688
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,680
What a great drive, from last to first.
Not many people can say that.

689
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,360
<i>His first Formula 1 victory.</i>

690
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,640
I've learned so much.
I've made so many friends here.

691
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,040
Thanks so much for everything.
All these years, man.

692
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,800
You guys have been amazing
and you have a friend.

693
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,360
Whenever you go to Mexico, please call me.

694
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,600
I'll look after you.

695
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,760
It makes me feel very, very sad,

696
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,160
seeing that my boys, you know,
when it's... some of them were crying

697
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,080
because we've been together
for... for so many years.

698
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,120
Life is not fair at all.

699
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Formula 1 neither.

700
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,560
Checo! Checo! Checo!

701
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,840
<i>There's Daddy.</i>

702
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,520
<i>He saw the entire race.</i>

703
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,520
<i>He was just screaming,
"Dad! Dad! Dad!"</i>

704
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,080
<i>We were all crying, darling.</i>

705
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,440
No, no, no.

706
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,120
I love you all, family.

707
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,640
Hello, mate. Well done.

708
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,200
- Sorry for you, man.
- No, sorry for you.

709
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,280
- At the beginning, you were lucky.
- So lucky, man.

710
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,641
I never thought
it was going to end up this way.

711
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,200
Congratulations. Amazing job.

712
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,720
- I just wanted to apologize.
- Thanks for coming. Thank you.

713
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,520
When I leave, I think
I'll be very thankful to the sport,

714
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,440
to Formula 1,

715
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,920
because what they've given me,
they've changed my life forever.

716
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,120
I needed this, man.

717
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,800
What's up, man? Good job.

718
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,720
- You're a badass, man.
- We're all badasses.

719
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,680
Thank you,
mate, for everything.

720
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,880
If this is to be the end,
I'm extremely pleased and... and happy

721
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,840
for what I have achieved.

722
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,640
So, thank you, Formula 1.

723
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,640
<i>- Hello, Christian.</i>
- Hey, Sergio.

724
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,840
- Welcome to Red Bull.
- <i>How are you doing?</i>

725
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,880
<i>Thanks, man.</i>

726
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,080
Congratulations and welcome to the team.

727
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,080
<i>Thanks, Christian.
I'm so much looking forward to it.</i>

728
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,880
Sergio Pérez is confirmed
as our race driver

729
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,000
for 2021.

730
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,000
<i>As we bring to an end
the Formula 1 season, it is down to this.</i>

731
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,480
The battle for third
in the Constructors', it's incredible.

732
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,040
At the last race of the season,
we still have this massive fight.

733
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,296
- We're in a good position.
- It'll go down to the wire.

734
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,080
Who wants it more will probably do it.

735
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,240
- <i>Let's fuck some shit up.</i>
- Everything we got.

736
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,840
If you're gonna take on Mercedes,
you've gotta be firing on all cylinders.

737
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,560
- Come on, boys!
<i>- The season finale!</i>
