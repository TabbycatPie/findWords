<i>OLDER TED: Kids, in life there are a lot of
big romantic moments,</i>

3
00:00:16,543 --> 00:00:18,205
<i>and they make life worth living.</i>

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,644
<i>But here's the problem.</i>

5
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:21,081
<i>Moments pass.</i>

6
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:23,767
<i>And lurking just around the corner
from those moments...</i>

7
00:00:23,863 --> 00:00:27,364
<i>is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality.</i>

8
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,059
<i>And so, back in 2006,</i>

9
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:32,589
<i>on the night of
Claudia and Stuart's wedding,</i>

10
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:34,347
<i>reality was the enemy.</i>

11
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:36,359
Wow, the Peace Corps?

12
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:39,438
Yeah, I ship out tomorrow. Two years.

13
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,284
You know, some people say...

14
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,969
the Peace Corps is the most noble thing
a person can do.

15
00:00:44,065 --> 00:00:46,174
To those people I say, 'Is it?'

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,201
And usually, they say, 'Yes, it is.'

17
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:51,289
But, Barney, they are so right.

18
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:53,463
Wish there was something I could do.

19
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:56,571
Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.

20
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,942
<i>This wasn't how I'd thought
the night would turn out.</i>

21
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:04,490
<i>This was finally supposed to be
my big moment with Robin,</i>

22
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,664
<i>but then reality came along.</i>

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,340
<i>Robin got called up last minute
to anchor the 11:00 news.</i>

24
00:01:10,435 --> 00:01:11,842
<i>It was her big break.</i>

25
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,462
<i>And I went to the wedding stag.</i>

26
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:17,343
<i>Then, when I least expected it...</i>

27
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:29,999
Hey, where the hell
did you disappear to last night?

28
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:33,026
I had the most amazing night ever.

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,816
Tell me about it.
That cake! Best cake I ever had.

30
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:37,606
Seriously. My stomach was like,

31
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:40,291
'Hey, bro, I don't know what you're eating,
'cause I don't have any eyes,

32
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:43,104
'but it's basically awesome.
So keep sending it down gullet alley.'

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,118
Yeah, I know. My stomach was like,

34
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:48,378
'Girlfriend, we don't always get along,
but that cake...'

35
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:50,041
TED: Lily?

36
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:53,557
Oh, right.
Most amazing night ever, and go.

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,689
You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.

38
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:59,065
I never hook up at weddings.

39
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,292
I'm guessing
you haven't always had this rule.

40
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,712
Well, here's the thing.
Those big, romantic moments,

41
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:07,589
they're great when they happen,
but they're not real.

42
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:09,730
Exactly. Exactly. Like just now,

43
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:11,553
when I saw you
doing the Chicken Dance out there,

44
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:14,334
I'm not gonna lie to you,
big time thunderbolt.

45
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:17,690
You should see me tap dance.
You'd be down on bended knee.

46
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:20,066
Sadly, not out of character.

47
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:22,453
But, I know now, it's just a mirage.

48
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,828
- Wedding goggles.
- Exactly.

49
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:27,599
And that, in a nutshell,
is why I'm not putting the moves on you.

50
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:30,636
- This isn't the moves?
- What, you... You think this is the moves?

51
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:32,426
Believe me, you'd know the moves.

52
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:35,303
People 10 tables away
would know the moves.

53
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:38,330
- That's too bad.
- Tell me about it.

54
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:41,430
You know, I think I have a solution.

55
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:42,623
Interested.

56
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,363
And to preface this,
we're not gonna sleep together tonight.

57
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,375
Less interested.

58
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:50,262
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

59
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:54,705
So the thing that always screws it up
is the next day. Right?

60
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:58,093
So, why don't we just cut that part out?

61
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,025
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, I'm here, you're here.

62
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:04,327
This is a big, romantic wedding.

63
00:03:04,423 --> 00:03:07,779
Why don't we just dance
and have a great time?

64
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:12,028
And then when it's over,
never see each other again.

65
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,315
- Unless...
- No, no unless.

66
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:18,985
No emails, no phone numbers,
not even names.

67
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:24,315
Tonight, we will make a memory
that will never be tarnished.

68
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:27,617
And then, when we're old and gray,

69
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:29,708
we'll look back on this night,

70
00:03:29,803 --> 00:03:31,841
and it'll be perfect.

71
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,044
Wow.

72
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,507
- Okay, I'm in.
- Okay.

73
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:40,778
I guess... What, we'll need fake names?

74
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,981
You can call me Buttercup.

75
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:47,559
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.
I'm Lando Calrissian.

76
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:51,252
Wow, this is kind of exciting.
Our names will forever be shrouded in...

77
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:52,978
Ted, Ted, Ted, look. I got a bridesmaid.

78
00:03:53,074 --> 00:03:55,215
Ted, look. Look, Ted.
The second hottest bridesmaid!

79
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:57,265
Ted, look. See you, Ted.

80
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:01,736
So, I'm Ted.

81
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:03,748
Victoria.

82
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:06,746
- But no last names.
- No last names.

83
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,951
What is wrong with you?

84
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:14,101
Yeah, dude, that is just like
a weenie ass idea.

85
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:16,664
No, it was awesome. I had a great night.

86
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,477
I'm never going to see her again.
And there's no way to ruin it.

87
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:22,342
Ted, how do I explain this to you?

88
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,239
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.

89
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:26,605
Now you think I'm gonna let that cake
out of my life? Hell, no.

90
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:28,044
I'm gonna find out
what bakery made that cake,

91
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,281
and damn it,
I'm gonna get some more cake.

92
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:32,455
That cake really got to you, huh?

93
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:34,467
It haunts me.

94
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,736
So, what happened next?

95
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:40,340
Okay, ground rules have been established.

96
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:45,282
Now, let's see some of these moves
I've heard so much about.

97
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,856
Wait, wait, wait.

98
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:56,269
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint
a big favor and steal the bouquet.

99
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:59,329
Yes, but we'll need a diversion.

100
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:01,383
Kiss!

101
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:02,662
ALL: Kiss! Kiss!

102

(ALL CHEERING) Kiss, come on. Kiss! Kiss!

103
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:06,593
Go, go, go.

104
00:05:06,689 --> 00:05:09,374
So, that's what happened to the bouquet.

105
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,562
You know, good for Victoria.
It's such an evil tradition.

106
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,671
- You're not gonna do it at your wedding?
- Oh, yeah!

107
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,995
I'm gonna take that flower grenade
and chuck it into the crowd and scream,

108
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:21,046
'Crawl for it, bitches!'

109
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:23,968
It's just what girls do.

110
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:26,042
So, where'd you guys go?

111
00:05:26,137 --> 00:05:29,720
<i>(TED PLAYING THE ENTERTAINER
ON THE PIANO)...</i>

112
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,698
- Very nice.
- Yeah?

113
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,312
Okay, I don't really know how to tap dance.

114
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,324
I couldn't tell.

115
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:49,056
Oh, it's too bad
you're not gonna get some tonight!

116
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:51,582
Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.

117
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:53,244
No, you couldn't.

118
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,097
You're a dude.

119
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:59,102
- I could get some.
- You could totally get some.

120
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:03,984
We're not gonna kiss tonight.

121

(BANGS PIANO KEYS)

122
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:09,642
I mean, if we kiss, all of this becomes real.

123
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:13,254
You might use too much tongue,
I might not use enough.

124
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,555
And then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.

125
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:19,316
I will use exactly the right amount
of tongue.

126
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:21,915
Okay, how about this?

127
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:27,781
The best part of any first kiss
is the lead up to it.

128
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:30,867
The moment right before the lips touch.

129
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:33,993
It's like a big drum roll.

130
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:37,382
So, how about tonight...

131
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:40,170
we just stick with the drum roll.

132
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:44,093
- Okay.
- But we can't kiss.

133
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:46,847
Okay.

134
00:07:05,548 --> 00:07:08,262
A drum roll? That's it?

135
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:12,358
So, what? You just...
You said good night, came home,

136
00:07:12,454 --> 00:07:14,571
and performed a drum solo?

137
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:17,386
Oh, Ted, you're such a doof!

138
00:07:17,472 --> 00:07:19,198
I mean, this girl sounds amazing.

She was completely amazing.

140

She was amazing and funny
and we connected on every level,

141
00:07:25,303 --> 00:07:28,072
and I'm never gonna see her again.

142
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,289
Damn it, I have to see her again.

- Yes!

So let's get to work, man.
What else do you know about her?

Nothing, her name's Victoria.
That's all I got.

Wait, Claudia. Claudia would know.

Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon.
She'll be back in two weeks.

- Call her then.
- Yes, two weeks. Good idea.

- I'm calling her now.
- No, Ted.

150

- You don't mess with a honeymoon.
- Yeah, come on, dude.

151

- Hey, Claudia!

Great wedding, beautiful toast,
touching stuff. How's the honeymoon?

155
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,168
Listen, I'm calling because
last night I met this girl,

156
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,894
and I was wondering if you had...

157
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,931
Oh, you have got to be freaking kidding me!

158
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,210
Here we go.

159
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:10,470
Twenty-four hours ago,
you were begging, begging me...

160
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:14,274
to bring some other girl to my wedding
and now, what, you're over her?

161
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,286
I've moved on.

162
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,333
What was her name?
Is it my fat cousin Lindsey?

163
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:20,123
Don't be embarrassed.
She has pretty eyes.

164
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:23,128
No. Her name was Victoria.
I don't know her last name.

165
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:27,443
Well, lucky for you. I know that guest list
backwards and forwards.

166
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,850
Thank God!

167
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:34,320
Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria
at my wedding. Goodbye, Ted.

168
00:08:38,119 --> 00:08:40,581
There was no Victoria at the wedding.

169
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:43,170
Maybe she used a second fake name.

170
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:45,376
Oh, she's good. She's very good.

171
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:48,796
Maybe she was a ghost.
That's why she didn't want to kiss you.

172
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:51,705
Because you'd just pass right through her
and feel really cold for a second.

173
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,942
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea
for a screenplay.

174
00:08:54,038 --> 00:08:56,339
Marshall, she was not a ghost.

175
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,098
I know that she wasn't a ghost.

176
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:01,741
She picked up a bouquet
proving she had corporeal form.

177
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:03,884
Wait! She was sitting across
from a couple of bridesmaids.

178
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,089
She must have been at their table.
Maybe they know who she was.

179
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:10,582
Great! So, how do we get in touch
with the bridesmaids?

180
00:09:12,578 --> 00:09:14,848
This better be good.
I'm about to enter Nirvana.

181
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,701
By the way, I should get you
Nirvana's phone number.

182
00:09:16,797 --> 00:09:18,651
She gives a great massage. Say what?

183
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:20,663
Barney!

184
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:22,487
I know the house rules.

185
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,499
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

186
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:27,186
Listen, Barney. I saw you taIking
to that bridesmaid last night.

187
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:29,998
- Did you happen to get her phone number?
- You know I did.

188
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,588
Great! I'm gonna need you
to call her for me.

189
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:34,600
You know I won't.

190
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,008
Why not?

191
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:39,588
Because, we just hooked up last night.
I can't call the girl the next day.

192
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:42,497
I have to wait at least, like, forever.

193
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:44,863
Oh, snap! Never gonna call her.

194
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,101
Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.

195
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:50,698
Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.

196
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:55,411
Ted going all castrati over yet another girl
is exactly not a good cause.

197
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,712
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you.
My hands are tied.

198
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:59,503
Oh, no, wait, that was last night.

199
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,515
(MIMICS WHIP CRACKING)

200
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:04,073
Okay, Barney,
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

201
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:05,192
You make this call...

202
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:09,146
and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.

203
00:10:09,827 --> 00:10:11,138
- Really?
- Yeah.

204
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:13,631
But, you always said
the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy,

205
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,924
- nor good at boxing.
- I'm ready to be proven wrong.

206
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,330
- Tonight?
- Tonight!

207
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:19,992
Dial.

208
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:23,445
Yeah, Tanya. Turns out I don't leave
for the Peace Corps until tomorrow.

209
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,457
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

210
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,111
Just one fewer day I get to help people.

211
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:30,988
Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was?

212
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:33,162
Hold on. What kind of shoes was she...

213
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,664
No, Tanya, he's a dude.

214
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,742
He's not gonna know
what kind of shoes she was wearing.

215
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:37,957
Actually...

216
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:39,968
Oh, come on!

217
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,302
Hey!

218
00:10:43,295 --> 00:10:45,245
So, what do you want to do next?
Don't think!

219
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:48,435
First thing that comes into your mind.

220
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:50,869
Hold this.

221
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:53,489
And this.

222
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:57,581
There she goes.

223
00:10:57,647 --> 00:11:01,833
Apparently, she was
wearing brown shoes...

224
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:05,029
with little snowflakes on them.

225
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:08,218
Yeah, they do sound cute.

226
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:10,623
Any idea who...

227
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,917
Okay. Well, thanks anyway.
Yeah, you take care.

228
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,228
What's...

229
00:11:15,324 --> 00:11:16,315
Tonight?

230
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,872
Well, I'm shipping out pretty early.

231
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,781
So, I won't be able to stay over,
but, yeah, sure, I'd love to.

232
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:24,018
Okay. I'll taIk to you later.

233
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,096
Sorry, Ted, I won't be able
to make Foxy Boxing tonight.

234
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,439
I understand.

235
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:29,484
Okay. Let's not lose hope.

236
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,169
We'll call the hotel.
Maybe she was staying there.

237
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:35,110
We'll have them check the registry
for anyone named Victoria.

238
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:39,278
- Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...
- Or Ictor.

239
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:42,081
She probably doesn't go by Ictor.

240
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:47,833
No, you know what? This is fate.
I am never supposed to see this girl again.

241
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:51,188
That was the whole point of the night.
I've just been saved from myself.

242
00:11:51,284 --> 00:11:53,362
- Let's drink many beers.
- Agreed.

243
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,111
<i>And I thought that was the end of it.
But then...</i>

244
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:58,122
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)...

245
00:12:00,874 --> 00:12:03,272
- Hey, there's the anchor lady.
- Hello.

246
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,253
- How was it?
- Oh, I don't know.

247
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,682
Why don't you ask the new substitute
weekend anchor?

248
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:10,368
Robin? Thanks, Robin. It was awesome.

249
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,669
- Back to you, Robin.
- Congrats!

250
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,235
- Thanks.
- That's so cool.

251
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:16,345
Yeah, I felt really bad
bailing on Ted though.

252
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:18,678
Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...

253
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,789
<i>And then Lily told her the whole story,</i>

254
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:24,080
<i>right down to the brown shoes
with the little snowflakes on them.</i>

255
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,092
<i>And by the end of it...</i>

256
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,523
What?

257
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,535
I know who she is.

258
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,312
You know who she is?
But you weren't even at the wedding.

259
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:40,307
Actually I kind of was.

260
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:41,883
What?

261
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:44,185
Well, after the newscast I was so excited,

262
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:48,434
I decided to surprise Ted
by going to the reception.

263
00:12:59,464 --> 00:13:01,254
Oh, damn it.

264
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:02,884
Oh, stop it.

265
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,896
What the hell?

266
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:06,368
VICTORIA: Hello?

267
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:07,615
You okay in there?

268
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,626
Yeah, I'm fine!

269
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,613
Just allergies or something. I'm fine.

270
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,249
Listen, do you wanna come
and cry out here?

271
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,360
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.

272
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:23,372
Oh, thanks.

273
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,867
But I don't actually cry in front of people...

274
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:28,960
or cry at all for that matter.

275
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:32,098
Man, it's gross.

276
00:13:32,643 --> 00:13:35,617
Does everyone snot up this much
when they cry?

277
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:39,051
Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter.

278
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,031
So, why you crying?

279
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:45,833
Because you have feelings for Ted.

280
00:13:45,973 --> 00:13:48,239
I don't know. Maybe?

281
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:52,111
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you?
Seriously!

282
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,882
He likes you, and you like him,
and just be together!

283
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:58,472
Jeez, Louise,
happiness is not that difficult.

284
00:13:58,567 --> 00:13:59,845
Oh, look, okay.

285
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:03,458
Yes, I cried in the bathroom
and that was weird.

286
00:14:03,554 --> 00:14:06,015
But that doesn't mean
I'm in love with the guy.

287
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,700
The fact is, I don't know how I feel.

288
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:10,106
Yes, you do.

289
00:14:10,202 --> 00:14:12,632
Seeing him with someone else
and crying about it?

290
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:14,454
Guess what? That's how you feel!

291
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,237
That is nothing but how you feel.

292
00:14:18,385 --> 00:14:20,942
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy?

293
00:14:21,038 --> 00:14:22,954
Kind of, yeah.

294
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:26,409
But it doesn't change anything.

295
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:30,657
I still don't wanna get married,
and he's still Ted.

296
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,783
What I should do is just tell him
who Victoria is, so he can be happy.

297
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,387
Or you could tell him that you're into him
and then you could both be happy.

298
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:41,398
I'm gonna go find him.

299
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,115
Well, wait.

300
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,675
Which one are you gonna tell him?

301
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:48,687
I have no idea.

302
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:50,894
And here's the most amazing part.

303
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:54,218
Because I told her I had converted
all my money to India dollars,

304
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:57,128
she gave me $50 to take a cab
to the airport.

305
00:14:57,223 --> 00:15:00,318
That's right. I just got paid for sex.

306
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:02,274
I really should give this money
to the Peace Corps.

307
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,192
They've done so much for me lately.

308
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,204
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

309
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,922
Ted, can I taIk to you outside for a second?

310
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:10,520
Sure, what's up?

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

312
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:14,161
I have to tell you something.

313
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:17,327
Oh, just get it.

314
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:20,007
- Hello?
- Ted? It's Stuart.

315
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,341
My lovely bride would like to say
something to you.

316
00:15:27,558 --> 00:15:28,965
Ted.

317
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,910
I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier.

318
00:15:31,937 --> 00:15:35,000
My new husband and vodka cranberry,

319
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,777
which cost $10.50

- Sweet pea.</i>

322
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:49,742
...have helped me realize that
sometimes I can act like a crazy person.

323
00:15:49,837 --> 00:15:53,897
And I don't want my new husband to think
I'm a crazy person.

324
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:57,222
It's fine, Claudia, don't worry about it.

325
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:59,651
Marshall wanted to know
where you guys got that cake.

326
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:01,663
Cake?

327
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,354
Why don't you take this?

328
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:07,450
Sounds like you could use it.

329
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:10,096
Thanks. You're very sweet.

330
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,715
So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?

331
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:15,921
We got it at this little bakery downtown.

332
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,520
Actually, neither.

333
00:16:17,615 --> 00:16:19,149
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.

334
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,067
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.

335
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,079
I made the cake.

336
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:27,139
She made the cake.

337
00:16:31,904 --> 00:16:33,374
Buttercup Bakery!

338
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,091
She wasn't on the guest list,
because she wasn't a guest.

339
00:16:36,187 --> 00:16:37,658
She made the cake!

340
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:41,230
She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl.

341
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:43,379
You gotta marry her. Today.

342
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:44,945
She has to move in with us.

343
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,470
- I'm going down to that bakery.
- No, no, don't do it.

344
00:16:47,566 --> 00:16:49,836
Baby, what are you taIking about?

345
00:16:49,931 --> 00:16:53,064
Yeah, all day long you've been busting
my apple bag about finding this girl.

346
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,060
Well, I just think that
maybe she's not that into you.

347
00:16:57,156 --> 00:17:00,820
And that's why
she didn't give you her number.

348
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:04,443
Robin, care to chime in with anything?

349
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,118
Yes.

350
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,196
Ted,

351
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,842
go get her.

352
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:15,440
Going. Getting!

353
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,815
Ted. Oh, my gosh, I love this moment.

354
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,965
You know why? 'Cause I'm gonna say it.

355
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:19,244
And this time,
you're actually gonna say yes.

356
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,897
You ready? You ready to say yes?
Ted, suit up!

357
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,207
Yes!

358
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:25,219
- No.
- Oh, come on!

359
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:30,656
- Guess we were gone a while.
- Oh, that's too bad.

360
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:34,009
I was looking forward to one last dance.

361
00:17:40,756 --> 00:17:43,036
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING ON CD PLAYER)</i>

362
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:55,396
Why, yes, I am.

363
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:57,442
Sorry, I could tell
what you were just thinking.

364
00:17:57,538 --> 00:17:59,583
Wow, what was I just thinking?

365
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,004
Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.

366
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,753
- You got me. You are good.
- Yeah.

367
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:07,895
You know, I don't look like this every day.

368
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:10,932
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears
a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt...

369
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:13,063
with bleach stains on it.

370
00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:15,931
The real Ted sounds real sexy.

371
00:18:17,548 --> 00:18:20,642
It's too bad I'll never get to see it.

372
00:18:25,283 --> 00:18:27,457
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.

373
00:18:27,553 --> 00:18:30,403
Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.

374
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:35,671
Ted? You still with us?

375
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:50,118
Tell me your last name.

376
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,587
You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.

377
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:57,025
What's that?

378
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,678
I'm gonna go home tonight
with a lot of great memories,

379
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:02,054
and one really sucky memory.

380
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:05,748
The memory of you waIking out that door.

381
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:10,003
Hey, Ted.

382
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:12,014
Yeah?

383
00:19:12,656 --> 00:19:16,035
Close your eyes and count to five.

384
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:21,606
One.

385
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,618
Two.

386
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,600
Three.

387
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,349
Four.

388
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,449
Five.

389
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:46,154
<i>TED: Until our dying days, we'll remember
everything about that night...</i>

390
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:48,165
<i>as perfect.</i>

391
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:50,377
Maybe we both need that.

392
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:52,642
I mean, so many things go wrong in life,

393
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:54,496
but this is the one thing that never will.

394
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:58,417
It will always, always be pure,

395
00:19:58,524 --> 00:20:00,464
unadulterated, awesome.

396
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:04,470
If I waIk in there, I'm robbing both of us
of what could be...

397
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:07,122
The meter's running, dude.
Crap or get off the pot.

398
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:09,134
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

399
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,779
Oh, thank God!
