等时机一到
So when the time is right,

推翻他的统治
taking over his organization

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,560
就会如同戴手套一样轻松
will be like slipping on a glove.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,820
我们不是要偷钱  布奇
The point wasn't to steal that money, Butch.

7
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,600
是要伤到法尔科内

8

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,930
她在这里会给布鲁斯少爷带来危险

洛夫克拉夫特  我有个目击证人
Lovecraft, I have an eyewitness

18

这里是韦恩庄园吗
This is Wayne Manor?

25
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,670
是的  但你不该来这儿
Yeah, but not sure you should be here.

26
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,420
你要迷路了  我可以告诉你怎么回去

嗯
Better.

37
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,140
你要真想考验自己
If you want to test yourself,

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,380
就该跟我去爬市中心大桥
you should come with me to the Midtown Bridge.

39
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,550
你爬过那桥
You've climbed it?

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,770
对  一直爬到顶上
Yeah, to the top.

41
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,250
小年轻都爬到上面去亲热
Kids go up there to make out. All the time.

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,050
你愿意的话我可以带你去
I could take you, if you want.

43
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,170
好啊
Okay.

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,740
我很乐意
I'd like that.

45
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,100
我先问你个问题
Let me ask you a question.

46
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,190
你在看的那些你爸妈的资料是什么回事
What's up with all the weird homework about your mom and dad?

47
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,870
我想弄明白为什么会发生这样的事
I'm trying to understand why it happened.

48
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,280
没什么为什么可言
There's no why.

49
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,440
坏事常会发生  你得过了这个坎
Bad stuff happens. You-you got to get over it.

50
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,710
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

51
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,110
那是当然
Of course I'm right.

52
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,100
你想吻我吗
You want to kiss me?

53
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,170
不  谢谢
No, thank you.

54
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,760
不想吗
No?

55
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,930
我想
I would like to,

56
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,340
但我总不禁觉得你别有用心
but I can't help feeling you have an ulterior motive.

57
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,170
我觉得你不会把我当做合适的恋人
I don't imagine you consider me a suitable romantic partner,

58
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,730
所以你为什么想吻我呢  我想不明白
so why would you want to kiss me? I don't know.

59
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,800
你想太多了  小子
You think too much, kid.

60
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,380
我只是想友善点
I'm just trying to be nice.

61
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,990
无意冒犯  我不觉得你是个友善的人
No offense, you don't strike me as a nice person.

62
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,200
什么意思  我很友善
What do you mean? I'm nice.

63
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,650
我不是说你不是好人  但是你不友善
I don't mean you're not a good person, but you're not nice.

64
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,540
你不太在乎别人
You don't care much for other people.

65
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,060
去你的  没爹娘的
Screw you, orphan.

66
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,070
自己一个人去爬桥吧
Climb the damn bridge on your own.

67
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,840
你好  小姐  有什么能为你效劳的
Yes, hello, Miss. How can I help?

68
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,000
天啊
Oh, dear.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,830
我的车  冲下了路面
My car, it went off the road.

70
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,080
拜托
Please...

71
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,480
请进  快请进
Please come in. Come in at once.

72
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,940
请帮我叫救护车
If you could call an ambulance.

73
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,750
你伤到了哪里
Where exactly are you hurt?

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,860
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred.

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,780
没事吧
Is everything all right?

76
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,940
是这样  布鲁斯少爷
No, Master Bruce.

77
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,130
这位女士出了车祸
This lady's been involved in a car accident.

78
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,090
跑  快跑
Run. Run!

79
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,950
这儿最好能走出去
This better be a way out.

80
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,170
穿过衣帽间就是以前的仆人走廊
The old servant's hallway, it's through the closet.

81
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,030
我得去帮阿尔弗雷德
But I need to help Alfred!

82
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,280
没时间了
There's no time!

83
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,550
布鲁斯  快走
Bruce, come on!

84
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,700
阿尔弗雷德可能受伤了  我不能抛下他
Alfred might be hurt. I can't leave him.

85
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,170
他让你快跑
He told you to run.

86
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,480
随便你
Fine.

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,400
你不走  我走
Stay, but I'm out.

88
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,210
布鲁斯
Bruce!

89
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,750

92
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,700
跟我描述下这个女人
What can you tell me about this woman?

93
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,140
她三十出头
Well, she was, uh, early 30s.

94
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,630
还挺能打的
A tasty fighter, actually.

95
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,540
听着  伙计  就是点小伤
Look, mate, it's just a scratch.

96
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,000
快走吧  行不
Shove off, will you?

97
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,400
我还有事要做
I've got stuff to do.

98
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,830
我们有五十个警察在搜索树林
Look, we've got 50 police in the woods,

99
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,820
还有更多在路上找
even more on the roads.

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,700
我们得重点调查这个女人和她的同伙
We need to focus on this woman and her people.

101

关于她你还能告诉我什么
What can you tell me about her?

他们都是职业杀手
They were trained killers.

103
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,650
就是你那个小姑娘把他们引过来的
And your bloody little girl brought them here.

104
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,990
这我们还不能确定
We don't know that yet.

106
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,560
你一定是阿尔弗雷德・潘尼沃斯了
You must be Alfred Pennyworth.

107

身手不赖啊
Nice job out there.

108
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,630
看来还不够好
Yeah, well, not nice enough, eh?

109
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,200
这是从死者身上搜出来的
This was taken off the dead guy.

110
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,920
除了这别的什么都没有  没钥匙也没身份证
Nothing else-- no keys, no I.D., nada.

111
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,340
我认得这女孩
Now, I know this girl.

112
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,240
她之前被儿童绑架犯抓走了

而现在居然在韦恩庄园
And now she's getting attacked by assassins

114
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,980
被杀手袭击了
at Wayne freaking Manor?!

115
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:48,920
这到底怎么回事  伙计
What the hell's going on, compadre?

116
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,360
怎么  你还没告诉他吗
What, you haven't told him?

117
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,630
告诉我什么
Told me what?

118
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,400
韦恩夫妇被害当晚
Selina Kyle was in the alley

119
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,200
塞琳娜・凯尔在那条巷子里
the night the Waynes were murdered.

120
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,780
她看到杀手的长相了
She saw the killer's face.

121
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,350
我的天  别开玩笑了
Oh, for Pete's sake, don't do this to me.

122
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,070
地检官办公室的哈维・丹特

在调查迪克・洛夫克拉夫特

124
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:04,770
他觉得洛夫克拉夫特和韦恩案有关
He thinks that Lovecraft is connected to the Wayne killings.

125
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,090
他放出我们有目击证人的消息
So, he leaked that we had a witness.

126
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,680
他以为这样能吓到洛夫克拉夫特
He thought he could spook Lovecraft.

127
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,950
让他露出马脚
Get him to reveal himself.

128
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,980
计划真厉害啊
Wow, that's a hell of a plan.

129
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,060
效果如何  好极了
How did it work out? Bravo!

130
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,310
我们以为她是安全的
We thought she was safe.

131
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,670
以为没人知道她在这里
We thought no one knew she was here.

132
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,550
你想错了  不是吗  你个呆子
Yeah, well, you were wrong, weren't you, you plank?

133
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,940
他们怎么知道的
How did they know?

134
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,550
这么蠢的计划怎么不告诉我一声
Why didn't you tell me about this foolishness?

135
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,770
因为你肯定会想阻止我
Because you would have tried to stop me.

136
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,200
我当然会阻止你啊  你个白痴
Of course I would tried to stop you, you putz!

137
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,080
你想什么啊
What the hell are you thinking?

138
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,480
韦恩案结了  案子结了
The Wayne case is closed. It is closed!

139
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,790
你明明清楚案子没结
You know damn well it's not closed!

140
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,860
少自以为是了
Don't tell me what I know!

141
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,630
你们两个都给我闭嘴
Will you shut up, the pair of ya!

142
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,680
你们可以待会儿再吵
You can argue later!

143
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:40,960
现在我们得找到布鲁斯少爷
Right now, we need to find Master Bruce.

144
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,920
好
All right.

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,880
要是他们待会儿没回来
If they don't come back soon,

146
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,220
就是去哥谭了
they would have headed to Gotham.

147
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,620
塞琳娜在那儿有安全感
Selina feels safe there.

148
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,960
看你能不能在城里找到她
Good luck trying to find her in the city.

149
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,500
像她那种流浪儿
A street kid like that?

150
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,440
但你会帮我们找到她的  对吗
But you will help us find her, right?

151
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,080
当然会
Yeah, of course I will,

152
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,280
因为我非得发疯
because I have to be crazy.

153
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,750
谢谢  好了
Thank you. All right,

154
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,530
我继续调查洛夫克拉夫特  我会找到他
I'll focus on Lovecraft, I'll find him,

155
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,250
如果他是幕后黑手  我会叫他收手的
and if he is behind this, I'll get him to call off the contract.

156
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,210
你想怎么叫他收手
How you gonna do that?

157
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,720
不知道  会想出办法的
I don't know, I'll think of something.

158
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,230
上街找  好吗
Run the streets, huh?

159
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,020
找你的联系人  干活儿去吧
Focus on your contacts. Go to work.

160
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,510
我跟你去
I'm coming with you.

161
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,630
好吧
All right.

162
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,850
作为一名男仆  你还挺厉害的啊
You're pretty handy for a valet.

163
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,730
管家  伙计
Butler, mate.

164
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,530
我是管家
I'm the butler.

165
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,600
我们得打电话给阿尔弗雷德
We need to call Alfred.

166
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,130
你有看见电话吗
You see any phones?

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,500
没有
No.

168
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,470
也许我们应该回我家去
Perhaps we should go back to my house.

169
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,840
如果警察在那里  我们就知道那里是安全的
If the police are there, we'll know it's safe.

170
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,260
是啊  没错
Yeah, right.

171
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,530
警察能保证安全吗
The police will make it safe?

172
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,970
我们总得联系警察啊
We have to contact the police at some point.

173
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,890
有人试图杀你
Someone tried to kill you.

174
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,450
我
Me?

175
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,610
没人知道我在那里
Nobody knew I was there.

176
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,150
那是你家  那些人是想杀你
It's your house; someone wants to kill you.

177
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,100
为什么会有人想要杀我
Why would anyone want to kill me?

178
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,840
一定是因为你那些蹩脚的小调查
Must be all that lame detective work you're doing.

179
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,940
结果还真好  是吧
Paid off good, huh?

180
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,910
开心点
Cheer up.

181
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,290
我们没事的
We're cool.

182
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,000
我们甩掉他们了
We lost them.

183
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,230
我很担心阿尔弗雷德
I'm worried about Alfred.

184
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,930
放松
Relax.

185
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,630
等我把你安全安置在城里
Once I got you safely hidden in the city,

186
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,130
我就去给你找部电话
I'll find you a phone.

187
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,140
谢谢你
Thank you.

188
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,840
很感谢你帮忙
I appreciate your help.

189
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,320
我只是想对你友善点
Just trying to be nice.

190
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,390
法尔科内别墅

191
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,560
马罗尼怎么会知道我的钱在哪里
How did Maroni know where my money was?

192
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,460
什么...
Wha...

193
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,600
这真是个好问题
Well, that's a very good question.

194
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,250
我无意埋怨  但您可以直接打个电话的
Not to criticize, but you could have just called me.

195
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,020
我再问你一次
I'm going to ask you once more.

196
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,180
马罗尼怎么会知道我的钱在哪里
How did Maroni know where I kept my money?

197
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,310
根本没人知道
No one knew.

198
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,120
军械库的抢劫
The robbery at the armory.

199
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,570
不是马罗尼干的
That wasn't Maroni.

200
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,520
我还以为我们是朋友呢
I thought we were friends.

201
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,250
我们达成了共识
We had an understanding.

202
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,560
你告诉我马罗尼的每步动作
You tell me every move Maroni makes.

203
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,120
发生什么事了
What happened?

204
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,200
你是什么时候背叛我的
When did you turn on me?

205
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,190
我没有  法尔科内阁下
Never, Don Falcone.

206
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,700
我发誓  绝对没有
I swear, never.

207
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,050
马罗尼和军械库的抢劫无关
Maroni had nothing to do with the armory job.

208
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,350
否则我会知道的
I would know.

209
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,490
我会告诉您的
I would have told you.

210
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,240
假如不是马罗尼  又是谁
Who was it if not Maroni?

211
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,390
他们又是怎么知道我的钱的
And how did they know about my money?

212
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,740
谢谢你  莉莎
Thank you, Liza.

213
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,780
马上就好了
Won't be long.

214
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,860
我等会儿再来
I'll come back.

215
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,720
我问了你一个问题
I asked you a question.

216
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,680
显然  您这儿有个内奸
Oh, you have a mole, obviously.

217
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,420
玩这套可不是马罗尼的强项  不是吗
Which is not Maroni's forte, is it?

218
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,140
这是别人干的
No, this is someone else.

219
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,610
某个狡猾的人
Someone artful.

220
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,510
某个和您很亲近的人
Someone close to you.

221
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,150
我知道你在说谁
I know who you're going to name.

222
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,130
但是你对菲什的恨意让我怀疑
But your hatred of Fish makes me doubt

223
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,890
你对她的一切指控
anything you say against her.

224
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,110
恕我直言...
With respect...

225
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,550
我不明白您为何还要容忍她
I don't understand why you still tolerate her existence.

226
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,070
她无数次表现出对您的不敬
She has proved her disloyalty a hundred times.

227
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,550
她想要杀您
She wants your head.

228
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,620
半数为我工作的人都有这想法
Like half the people who work for me.

229
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,170
菲什为我赚了很多钱
Fish makes me a lot of money.

230
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,460
我可以对付菲什・穆尼
I can handle Fish Mooney,

231
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,810
或是任何背叛我的混蛋
or whatever son of a bitch did this to me.

232
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,400
告诉我怎么找出奸细
Tell me how to find the mole.

233
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,090
您就交给我吧  法尔科内阁下
You leave that to me, Don Falcone.

234
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,540
这是脏活儿
Dirty work.

235
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,470
我会为您找出奸细的
I'll find your mole for you.

236
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,940
相信我
Trust me...

237
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,700
他绝对是菲什的人
he'll belong to Fish.

238
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,040
拿出证据来
Bring me proof.

239
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:10,090
我不明白
I don't get it.

240
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,820
你  盖布  不明白
You, Gabe? Not get it?

241
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,450
令人惊奇啊
Quelle surprise.

242
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,960
说说吧  你哪里不明白
What, pray, don't you get?

243
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,900
为什么不告诉法尔科内真相
Why not just tell Falcone the truth?

244
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,500
是那个莉莎背叛了他
It was that Liza girl that betrayed him.

245
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,480
时机  盖布利尔
Timing, Gabriel.

246
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:27,690
时机就是一切
Timing is everything.

247
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,840
莉莎就是一枚定时炸弹
And Liza is a time bomb.

248
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,150
你就...
Just...

249
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,280
等上一阵子
wait a while.

250
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,140
然后好好看着学着吧
Then watch and learn.

251
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,620
待在那里以防他出现
Stay there in case he shows.

252
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,020
洛夫克拉夫特不在家
Lovecraft isn't at home.

253
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,560
管家从昨天就没见到他了
Housekeeper hasn't seen him since yesterday.

254
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,920
艾伦说他没去办公室
Allen says he didn't come into his office.

255
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,200
他和蒙托亚正在监视那里
He and Montoya are watching it.

256
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,160
杀手怎么知道我的证人在哪的
How did the killers know where to find my witness?

257
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,380
冷静点  这是个胜局
Let's keep calm here. It's a win.

258
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,580
咱们惊了洛夫克拉夫特
We've made Lovecraft panic.

259
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,830
-这是慌张之举  -胜局
- This is a panic move. - A win?!

260
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,040
那两个孩子只身在外
There's two children out there with

261
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,020
被职业杀手追杀
professional assassins coming after them.

262
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,630
布鲁斯和塞琳娜可能会死
Bruce and Selina could end up dead.

263
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,400
我们会让洛夫克拉夫特叫停他们的
We're gonna get Lovecraft to call them off.

264
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,840
他们怎么知道的
How did they know?

265
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,190
我从没告诉过你她的名字
I never told you her name,

266
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,560
更别说她藏在哪里了
let alone where she was hiding,

267
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,760
-所以你不可能...  -我当然不会
- so you couldn't have... - I should say not.

268
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,810
你也没向任何人提过我的名字  对吗
And you never mentioned my name to anyone, right?

269
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,680
没有  我们说好的
No, we agreed.

270
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,890
我不会公开提起任何名字
I didn't mention any names out loud.

271
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,100
不会"公开"提起
No names "out loud"?

272
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,020
那私下呢
What about whispering?

273
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,130
别瞒着我  我会查出来的
Don't hold out on me. I'll know.

274
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,320
作为幕后消息  我泄露了你的名字给几个线人
For deep background, I leaked your name to a couple of select sources.

275
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,620
以增加真实性  我没别的办法
I had to, for credibility!

276
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,760
你是调查韦恩案的警察
You're the Wayne murders cop.

277
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,880
见鬼  他们就是这么找到她的
Damn it! That's how they got to her.

278
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,470
花了这么久才找到她真是奇迹了
I'm surprised it took them this long to find her.

279
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,510
这都是你的错  丹特
This is on you, Dent!

280
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,100
的确是我的错
I'll stipulate mea culpa.

281
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,570
暴揍我  随你便
Kick my ass, be my guest.

282
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,170
但是咱们先找到洛夫克拉夫特
But let's find Lovecraft first

283
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,080
让他叫停那些杀手
and get him to call off the killers.

284
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,250
他不在家  也不在他的办公室
He's not at home, he's not at his office.

285
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,360
他甚至可能离开了高谭
He could've left Gotham.

286
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,600
可能有人窝藏了他
Someone could be hiding him.

287
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,680
洛夫克拉夫特有几处公寓
Lovecraft...has got a couple of condos

288
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,260
是登记在他情妇名下的
that he keeps under his mistress's name.

289
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,800
一个在史蒂文斯堡  另一个在上城区
One up in Stevensburgh and one, uh, uptown.

290
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,260
上城区的那个我去
I'll take the one uptown.

291
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,520
要是这俩孩子出了什么事
If anything's happened to these kids...

292
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,220
我们知道你和一个叫小猫的女孩
We know you ran with a girl

293
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,410
是朋友
called Cat.

294
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,010
她现在很危险
She's in serious danger.

295
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,070
谁又不危险呢
Who isn't, right?

296
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,310
世界就是这么疯狂
Crazy world.

297
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,040
你要多少
How much?

298
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,520
这是100
There's $100.

299
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,650
听着
All right, listen.

300
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,470
我不知道小猫住哪里
I don't know where Cat lives, all right?

301
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,860
她很注重这方面的隐私
She's... private about stuff like that.

302
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,510
但我听说  她找了个新销赃人
But... I heard that she got a new fence,

303
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,130
因为之前那个被抓了
'cause her old one got popped.

304
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,360
他肯定知道哪里能找到她
He'd know where to find her.

305
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,530
这个销赃人是谁
Who's the fence?

306
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,410
我不知道
I don't know.

307
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,910
但我知道谁可能知道
But I know who would know.

308
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,400
是吗  那又是哪位
Oh, yeah? Who's that?!

309
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,820
真是的  阿尔弗雷德  省省吧你
Damn it, Alfred, save your cheese!

310
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,680
我用一摞硬币就能打到他招供
I can beat the truth out of this kid with a roll of quarters!

311
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,030
去问菲什・穆尼
Yo, ask Fish Mooney.

312
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,340
所有销赃人都归她管
She runs all the fences.

313
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,650
抱歉吓到大家了
Forgive me for shocking you,

314
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,630
但允许我给大家解释一下
but let me give you some context here.

315
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,860
我很爱巴尼恩
I loved Bannion.

316
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,170
起家时他就跟着我了
We came up together.

317
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,040
但他应该守好军械库的  可他失败了
But he was supposed to guard the armory, and he didn't.

318
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,690
而且也许  只是也许
And maybe, just maybe,

319
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,090
是他背叛了我
he looked the other way.

320
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,990
我不确定
I don't know.

321
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,520
那我该怎么办呢
So what do I do?

322
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,780
放任不管吗
Let it lie?

323
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,010
老大  我们理解...
Boss, we understand...

324
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,890
不管还有谁参与了  很快  就会祈求
Whoever else was involved will very soon wish

325
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,320
他们死的能像巴尼恩一样痛快
they could die quickly, like Bannion.

326
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,810
现在  我们所有人都得为家族利益着想
In the meantime, all of us must do what's right for the family.

327
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,310
你们每个人的税都要加25%
Each of your tariffs will increase 25%

328
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,740
直到补上储备的空缺
until we've built the reserves again.

329
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,610
无意冒犯  但这有点高吧
No disrespect, that's high.

330
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
是有点
A little bit.

331
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,890
你怎么想  菲什  我的要求合理吗
What do you think, Fish? Am I being fair?

332
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,470
我们是一家人
We're family.

333
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,500
有福同享  有难同当
We sink or swim together.

334
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,440
你们都学着菲什点
You could all learn from Fish.

335
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,560
她就很信任我
She trusts me.

336
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,660
你信任我  我就信任你
Trust me, and I'll trust you.

337
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,260
这是双向的
It goes both ways.

338
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,160
吃饭吧
Let's eat.

339
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,640
有电话
There's a phone!

340
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,490
快来
Come on!

341
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,140
我没有硬币
I don't... I don't carry coins.

342
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,460
你有硬币吗
Do you have any coins?

343
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,110
没
Nope.

344
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,400
一个子儿都没
Not a dime.

345
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,810
再说阿尔弗雷德对你有这么重要吗
Why does Alfred matter so much to you anyway?

346
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,950
他不过是你的管家
He's just your butler.

347
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,260
他是我的家人
He's my family.

348
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,040
好运  小子  也许后会有期吧
Good luck, kid. See you around maybe.

349
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,910
什么
What?

350
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,430
-等等  -听着
- Wait! - Look...

351
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,700
那些坏人是冲我来的
those bad guys were there for me.

352
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,830
不是你
Not you.

353
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,730
你不必担心
You have nothing to worry about.

354
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,890
回家吧
Go home.

355
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:21,390
可是你说
But you said...

356
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,530
我只是想吓唬你
I was just trying to freak you out.

357
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,860
我逗你玩的
I was playing with you.

358
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,090
你逗我玩
You were playing with me?

359
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,310
这也太残忍了吧
That's kind of cruel, isn't it?

360
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,200
是的
Yeah.

361
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,050
听我说
No, look,

362
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,140
你对我的看法没错
you're right about me.

363
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,500
我并不友善
I'm not nice.

364
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,630
不像你
Not like you.

365
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,230
你待人非常友善
You got a nice way about you.

366
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,590
-待人友善  -是的
- "A nice way"? - Yeah.

367
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,640
所以我才说他们的目标是你
That's why I said that thing about you being the target,

368
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,490
这样我们就可以在外多玩一会儿
so, you know, we could hang out a while longer.

369
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,950
我懂了
I see.

370
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,240
好复杂的心理
It's very convoluted reasoning.

371
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,040
随你怎么说
Whatever.

372
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,050
总之  很高兴认识你
Anyhow, it's been cool.

373
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,050
-我要消失了 -你不能这么做
- I'm gonna disappear. - But you can't do that!

374
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,830
-我不是在征求你的意见  -你不能消失
- I wasn't asking. - You can't disappear!

375
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,370
你得和我一起回家
You have to come back home with me.

376
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,090
等戈登警探找到杀害我父母的凶手
When Detective Gordon finds the man who killed my parents,

377
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,100
你得作证
you have to testify.

378
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,740
你真以为会有那一天吗
You really think that was ever going to happen?

379
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,320
别幼稚了  B
Grow up, B.

380
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,310
不  别跳  你跳不过来的
No, don't! You won't make it!

381
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,770
救命
Help.

382
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,430
你疯了
You're crazy.

383
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,780
请别再跑了  我喘不过气了
Please don't run off again. I'm out of breath.

384
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,020
好吧  小子
Okay, kiddo.

385
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,430
你赢得这资格了
You earned it.

386
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,040
要跟我待在一起也行
You want to hang with me, that's cool,

387
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,710
但是在我的地盘就要听我的
but my world, my rules.

388
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,160
照我说的做
You do what I say.

389
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,190
遵命  女士
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,590
我为什么不能给阿尔弗雷德
Why can't I call Alfred

391
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,410
或戈登警探打电话  向他们报平安呢
or Detective Gordon to let them know I'm okay?

392
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,960
因为我们现在消失了
Because we're disappearing.

393
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,390
要像烟一样无迹可寻
You got to be like smoke.

394
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,730
烟可不会打电话报平安
Smoke doesn't make phone calls.

395
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,350
-这是什么地方  -跳蚤市场
- What is this place? - The Flea.

396
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,920
就像流浪儿的购物中心
It's like the mall for street kids,

397
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,540
还没有难听的音乐
without the crappy music.

398
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,430
天黑之前  我们在这里都很安全
We'll be safe here till dark.

399
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,450
法尔科内让我很紧张
Falcone's making me nervous.

400
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,920
如果他怀疑是我们炸毁了他的钱
If he suspects it was us who blew up his money,

401
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,580
那他为什么还不行动
why hasn't he made a move?

402
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,220
因为他对此不确定
'Cause he can't be sure.

403
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,360
还有另外十个人可能做这事
There are ten other people who could have done this.

404
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,770
那现在怎么办
So what now?

405
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,930
照原计划行事
You're going to stick to the plan.

406
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,860
你去联系萨维亚诺和图斯基
You're gonna reach out to Saviano and Turski.

407
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,890
他们俩都很生气税率涨了
They are both very angry that their taxes have been raised,

408
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,940
也担心自己会落得巴尼恩的下场
and they're worried about ending up like Bannion.

409
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,100
他们准备好了
They're ready.

410
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,990
老家伙在把他的手下赶到我这边
The old man is herding his sheep toward me.

411
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,340
收到  老大
You got it, boss.

412
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,270
好
All right.

413
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,030
先生们  你们好啊
Hello, gentlemen.

414
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,780
我们很忙  哈维  你明年再来吧
Busy day, Harvey. Come back next year.

415
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,770
对天发誓  布奇
Hand to God, Butch,

416
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,960
我会比水手上岸休假还快
I'll be quicker than a sailor on shore leave.

417
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,440
我们在找一个小偷
Thief we're tracking down.

418
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,540
眼熟吗  人称"小猫"
Look familiar? Goes by "Cat."

419
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,410
不认识
Nope.

420
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,480
也许菲什认识她
Maybe Fish knows her.

421
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,900
菲什谁都认识
Fish knows everyone.

422
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,010
菲什很忙
Fish is busy.

423
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,610
她和你们的一个销赃人有来往  是个新人
She works with one of your fences, a new guy.

424
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,840
销赃人是什么
What's a fence?

425
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,860
拜托  布奇  友善一点
Come on, Butch. Be nice.

426
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,240
这很重要
This is important.

427
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,470
菲什呢
Where's Fish?

428
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,980
我说了  她很忙
I told you, she's busy.

429
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,810
我以前认识一个叫布奇的伙计
I once knew a fella called Butch.

430
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:26,490
他是白教堂人
Yeah, he was a Whitechapel lad.

431
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,370
我们这么叫他  但他其实不是个壮汉
Now, we called him Butch, you see, 'cause he wasn't.

432
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,480
只是为了激怒他
It was a wind-up.

433
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,710
取笑他
It was like a joke name.

434
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,460
事实上  他是个讨厌的小个子
In fact, he was a horrible little toe rag.

435
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,300
怎么
What?

436
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,490
我搞不懂  你是...在恐吓我吗
I can't tell. Are-are you... are you threatening me?

437
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,580
他是在恐吓我吗
Is he threatening me?

438
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,500
是吗
Yeah?

439
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,660
你不是...
You can't...

440
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,590
好了  这个菲什在哪
Now... where is this Fish?

441
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,410
就在这里
Right here.

442
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,560
吵什么呢
So... what's the fuss?

443
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,320
他们闹着玩呢
They're just fooling around.

444
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,620
我们在找个女孩
We're looking for this girl,

445
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,180
一个街头小偷  叫小猫
a street thief, goes by Cat,

446
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,840
和你一个销赃人有来往
works with one of your fences.

447
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,570
有点眼熟  为什么这么急
Looks familiar. What's the urgency?

448
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,650
有职业杀手在找她
Professional killers are looking for her.

449
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,180
职业杀手
Professionals, huh?

450
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,910
这不会是洛夫克拉夫特的目击证人吧
This wouldn't be the Lovecraft witness, now would it?

451
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,400
你怎么知道的
How'd you know?

452
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,350
坊间传言
Streets talk.

453
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,610
利用她去吓唬洛夫克拉夫特
Using her to scare Lovecraft.

454
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,010
她看见了杀害韦恩夫妇的人
She saw the Waynes' killer,

455
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,320
据称如此
supposedly.

456
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:24,900
是的
Yeah.

457
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,310
你来是想让我帮你找到她  是吧
And you're here because you want me to help you find her, don't you?

458
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,550
是的
Yes.

459
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,680
哈维
Harvey...

460
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:40,970
我凭什么帮你找她呢
Why in the world would I help you find her, of all people?

461
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,090

阿尔弗雷德  我很想帮助你
Well, you see, Alfred, I would love to help you,

469
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,140
但那会损害我的个人利益
but it would infringe upon my personal interests.

470
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,830
我为什么要那么做呢
And why would I do that?

471

你拥有深邃的...目光

472
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,800
恕我冒昧  穆尼女士
if I may say so, Miss Mooney.

473
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,680
我能看出  你不会为
And I can see that you're not a woman that would

474
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,900
一己私利  不顾道义
let petty self-interest outweigh... honor.

475
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,010
和慈悲
And compassion.

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,080
我态度挺好的  你说这个干什么
I am cool. Why are you telling me that?

499
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,310
你干吗对我指手画脚的
Why are you telling me what to do?

500

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:27,540
我生他的气做什么
Why would I get mad at him?

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,710
又不是他的错  是吧
It's not his fault, is it?

505
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,250
是你杀了我父亲吗
Did you kill my father?

506
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,350
是你逼我母亲割腕的吗

看见了  他在奈何岛的工厂那边

往前走
Keep moving.

520

她就是个小女孩而已
She's just a little girl.

521
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,620
你这么怕她做什么
Why are you so scared of her?

522
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,770
她就是让人害怕  别回头
Because she's scary. Don't look back.

523
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,420
哥谭市警局

你因涉嫌谋杀被捕了

谋杀  我  还谋杀
Murder? Me, murder?

528
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,780
你在说什么呢
Look, what are you talking about?

529
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,910
你派人刺杀塞琳娜・凯尔
You put a hit out on Selina Kyle.

530
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,530
不  不是我
No, not me.

531
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,190
刺杀她的人也来要我的命了
The same people that came after her came after me, too.

532
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,080
他们在大街上袭击我
Th-They attacked me on the street.

533
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,340
不然你以为我藏什么呢
Why do you think I'm hiding in here?

534
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,510
他们追杀你做什么
Why would they come after you?

535
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,920
还能为了什么
Why do they ever come?

536
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,680
我知道得太多了
Because I know too much.

537
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,870
少废话  你究竟怕谁
Cut the crap. Who are you so scared of?

538
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,140
你真是什么都不知道  是不是
You have no idea, do you?

539
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,040
你以为我是幕后大佬
You think I'm the big wheel.

540
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,140
到了关键的时候  小子
When it comes to the crunch, kid,

541
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,780
我跟你一样  什么都不是
I'm nobody, just like you.

542
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,420
真正掌握这城市的人
A-And the people who really, truly run this city,

543
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,070
他们看着你到处忙活  寻求正义
they're watching you huff and puff and run around crusading,

544
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,190
他们只会嘲笑你
and they are laughing at you.

545
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,330
你深陷迷宫
You're so deep in the maze,

546
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,520
根本看不清大局
you can't see over the wall.

547
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,460
跟我说点我不知道的
Tell me something I don't know.

548
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,030
我的箱子  在床下  有文件

549
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:34,890
去拿
Go.

550
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,930
就在韦恩夫妇被杀之前
Right before the Waynes got killed,

551
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,340
有人操纵韦恩集团股票
there was a run on Wayne Enterprises stock.

552
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,540
就像是有人知道要有坏事发生
Like somebody knew something bad was gonna happen.

553
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,820
所以我就觉得我该分杯羹
So I figured I deserved a cut.

554
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,630
于是便开始调查
So I started digging.

555
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,750
我是为那人而来
I've come for that man.

556
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,300
你不必受伤
You need not get hurt.

557
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,940
刚刚真好玩
That was nice.

558
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,620
找时间再玩一次吧
Let's do it again sometime.

559
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,260
说
Yeah?

560
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,870
菲什有俩孩子的线索

561
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,350
奈何岛一个叫工厂的地方

562
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,840
据说小猫的销赃人叫克莱德

563

他就在那里  我们这就过去

我谁不欠啊
Who don't I owe?

568

洛夫克拉夫特先生
Mr. Lovecraft?

569
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,090
糟糕
No, no, no, no, no.

570
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,290

00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,060
我不知道
I have no idea.

618
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,770
别逼我伤你
Don't make me hurt you.

619
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:36,700
你不是我的任务
You're not on the contract.

620
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,320
她走了
She's gone.

621
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,650
给你点建议  孩子
Some advice, kid:

622
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,480
别把勇敢当聪明
don't ever mistake bravery for good sense.

623
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,390
阿尔弗雷德
Alfred.

624
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,060
没想到会在这里见到你
Fancy seeing you here.

625
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,190
你没事吧
You all right?

626
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,820
我没事
I'm fine.

627
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,610
你呢
How are you?

628
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,580
你吓死我了  布鲁斯少爷
You really scared me, Master Bruce.

629
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,970
如果你死了
If you die...

630
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,800
这年头还有谁雇管家啊
who employs butlers anymore?

631
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,550
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

632
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,080
洛夫克拉夫特是社会栋梁
Lovecraft was a beloved pillar of this community.

633
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,170
尽心服务哥谭
A dedicated servant of Gotham.

634
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,330
我该怎么跟媒体说
So, what do I tell the media, huh?

635
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,270
有建议吗
Any ideas?

636
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,820
他是个骗子
He was a crook.

637
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,540
我们差点抓到他了
We nearly had him.

638
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,900
杀他的人  是如果他能活着作证
And he was killed by whoever he would have implicated

639
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,690
会指认的人
if he had lived to testify.

640
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,420
就这么说
Say that.

641
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,390
抱歉我无法采取你的办法
Forgive me if I can't get behind your approach.

642
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,650
杀他的是你的枪
It was your gun.

643
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,220
我没杀他
I didn't kill him.

644
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,500
总的来说  我相信你
On balance, I believe you-- on balance.

645
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,880
但自杀更加干净利落...
But suicide is much cleaner...

646
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,710
不是自杀  是他杀
It wasn't suicide, it was murder!

647
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,260
就是自杀
It was suicide!

648
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,780
他被你无休止的询问逼疯了
He went mad under your relentless questioning,

649
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,090
制服了你
overpowered you

650
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,390
用你的枪自杀了
and killed himself with your gun.

651
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:45,850
不要给我别的说辞
And don't tell me otherwise.

652
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,190
怎么样  律师
What do you say, counselor?

653
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,450
我听您的  詹姆斯市长
I'm at your disposal, Mayor James.

654
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,990
抱歉让您担心了
I'm sorry if we've caused you any disquiet.

655
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,780
"担心"
"Disquiet."

656
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,370
你两个自大的小丑
You arrogant clowns.

657
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,730
你们在攻击这座城市的根基
You're hacking away at the very foundations of this city.

658
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,840
想扳倒我
Trying to take me down!

659
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,920
真该把你俩塞进麻袋
Should have the both of you stuffed in a sack

660
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,410
丢进河里
and thrown in the river.

661
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,150
但我不能那么做
But I can't do that.

662
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,470
找两个替罪羊太慌张了
Two scapegoats would look like panic.

663
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,900
但你们有一个要倒霉的  记住我的话
But one of you is going down, mark my words.

664
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,290
先生  不该这样
Sir, that's not right.

665
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,340
闭嘴吧
Hush.

666
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,130
不会是你的  丹特
It's not you, Dent.

667
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,200
当然是戈登先生
Obviously, it's Mr. Gordon.

668
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,220
先生  我抗议
Sir, I protest.

669
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,720
但不会逼得太紧
But not too much.

670
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,290
瞧  丹特律师
You see, Counselor Dent

671
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,790
就知道守规矩
knows how to walk the line.

672
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,720
他知道极限在哪
He knows where the edge is.

673
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,790
而你呢  戈登先生
You, Mr. Gordon,

674
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,230
你不知道极限在哪
do not know where the edge is.

675
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,020
詹姆斯市长
Mayor James.

676
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,850
去你妈
Kiss my ass.

677
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,250
迪克・洛夫克拉夫特的自杀是个天大的惨剧
Dick Lovecraft's suicide is a terrible, terrible tragedy.

678
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:20,890
对抗一位热血过头的警察
Fighting the trumped-up charges

679
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:24,950
捏造的指控令他难以承受
of an overzealous police officer was too much for him.

680
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,050
我保证  迪克
You have my word, Dick.

681
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,470
这名警察已经受到了责罚
This officer is being dealt with.

682
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,700
阿卡姆精神病院
Arkham Asylum?

683
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,280
去给疯子做保安
A security guard for nut-jobs?

684
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,230
罪犯疯子  没错
Criminal nut-jobs, yeah.

685
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,050
你要接受吗
Are you taking the assignment?

686
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,280
不是这个就得辞职了
It's that or quit.

687
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,430
那就辞职啊
So quit.

688
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,380
他们就希望我辞职
That's what they want me to do.

689
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,480
该死  吉姆
Damn, Jim.

690
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,190
不管你接下来的搭档是谁
Whoever your next partner is,

691
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,070
不论是男是女  肯定比我好对付
he or she will be a lot easier than me.

692
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,030
爱德
Ed.

693
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,780
戈登警探  我听说你要受罚被革职了
Detective Gordon, I hear you've been thrown out in disgrace.

694
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,670
是这样吗
Is this true?

695
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,980
是的
Yeah, it is.

696
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,270
我要给上面写信
I'm gonna write a letter to the boss.

697
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,500
行啊
You do that.

698
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,160
我该写给谁
Which boss should I write to?

699
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,540
不用了  爱德
Forget it, Ed.

700
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,580
我就是倒霉
That's the breaks, huh?

701
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,940
你保重
You take care.

702
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,230
或许你该把他带上
Maybe you should take him with you.

703
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,680
如果他走了你会想他的
You'd miss him if he was gone.

704
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,020
才不会呢
No, I wouldn't.

705
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,160
回头让我请你喝酒吧
Let me buy you a drink sometime.

706
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,460
回头的
Soon.

707
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,990
你的安保系统还是这么差劲
Your security still sucks.

708
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,260
没人想找我麻烦
No one's hunting for me.

709
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,850
我以为见不到你了
I didn't expect to see you again.

710
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,580
我还没道别呢
Never said good-bye.

711
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,580

No, we didn't.

712

我不想无礼啊
Didn't want to be rude.

713

能见到你很高兴
It-it's good to see you.

你比我更需要
You need it more than I do.

717
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,590
不了  我们之间还是坦坦荡荡的吧
Nah, let's keep things honest between us.

718
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,340
这个我要留着
I'm keeping this one anyway.

719
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,640
在聊天呢  布鲁斯少爷
Having a little chat, Master Bruce?

720
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,050
就是在自言自语
Thinking out loud.

721
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,990
好吧
Right.

722
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,630

Right. Of course you were.

723

要我替你拿着吗
Shall I take that for you?

724
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,740
这老房子少了她
The old house seems very quiet...

725
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,230
好冷清  不是吗
without her, doesn't it?

726
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,090
是啊
Yes, it does.
