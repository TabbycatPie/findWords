1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,080
Hey, honey.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,760
Oh, you're just in time for breakfast.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,950
Ooh, we should probably go light on the food.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,630
Something tells me we're

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,500
not gonna want to do this on a full stomach.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,280
I can't believe there's such a thing as autopsy camp.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,390
There is no such thing as autopsy camp.

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,090
I had to trick Luke

9
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,710
'cause I'm actually taking him to a ballroom-dance class.

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,640
He's been resisting,

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,380
but it's in his blood.

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,750
I come from a long line of dancing Dunphys --

13
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,370
A kick line, actually.

14
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,100
Come on, we don't want to be late,

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,410
like the guy we're gonna see on the table.

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:28,990
Am I right?

17
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,470
Of corpse you are.

18
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,780
Hey, mom, can you take me driving?

19
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,640
My test is coming up, and I really need to practice.

20
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,110
Oh, honey, I would,

21
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,100
but I've got a big

22
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,860
closets and blinds union meeting today.

23
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,960
There is no closets and blinds union.

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
Driving with Alex is torture.

25
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,820
She drives so slowly.

26
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,330
I have to be the only parent

27
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,530
who slams on the imaginary gas.

28
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Hey, I'm not doing anything. I guess I could take her.

29
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,220
Great! I'll go check the tire pressure and the fluid levels!

30
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,100
Fun! Can't wait!

31
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,580
Be out in a sec!

32
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,320
Okay, my rate just went up.

33
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,500
All right, but this buys your time and your silence.

34
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,690
Alex can never know how much I hate driving with her.

35
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,620
Mm, she's in a hurry today.

36
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,800
Oh, that's just step one of her nine-point safety test.

37
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,070
Step two is checking the horn

38
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,430
to make sure checking the horn didn't break the horn.

39
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,640
She should never drive.

44
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,270
Forget it! You tricked me!

45
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,980
I'm sorry, buddy, but no son of mine's

46
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,380
going to high school without at least knowing

47
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,230
how to do a proper box step.

48
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,290
Trust me, dancers always get the girls.

49
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,690
Remember the great Kevin Bacon

50
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,720
from "Footloose"?

51
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,370
More like "Footloser."

52
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,460
Careful!

53
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,580
All right, no more talking. We're doing this.

54
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,080
You'll thank me someday.

55
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,840
It gets better when you find your signature move!

56
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,000
They used to call me "King of the dips"!

57
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,830
Why can't we just repurpose some of the stuff

58
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,250
from manny's party last night?

59
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,820
We got half a cake left.

60
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,100
The balloons are fine.

61
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,020
It's bad enough that both my sons

62
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,720
have to share the same birthday.

63
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,650
At least they deserve their own party.

64
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,250
You think Joe's gonna mind day-old cake?

65
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,090
He can't even eat it. He's got three teeth.

66
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,580
I'll remember that in 20 years

67
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,470
when you want cake.

68
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,800
He doesn't even know the party's for him.

69
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,290
He understands more than you think.

70
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,070
Right, Andy?

71
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,520
Who, F-Jo here? He is smart as a whip.

72
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,390
When we play peek-a-boo, half the time he's ahead of me.

73
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,310
Not exactly "Clash of the Titans."

74
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,960
Manny, whose coat is that?

75
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,550
Amy Martin left it here last night after my party.

76
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,880
I was getting some pretty strong signals from her.

77
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,130
I think she did it on purpose

78
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,950
so she'd have an excuse to come back.

79
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,600
Or because she couldn't get out fast enough.

80
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
If she was a cartoon,

81
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,130
she'd have left her skin here.

82
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,070
What does that mean?

83
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,680
That Amy is out of his league.

84
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,870
He always does this and ends up getting hurt.

85
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,680
- You need to talk to him. - And say what?

86
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,040
Tell him to go for girls he stands a chance with.

87
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,580
I overheard him talking to Reuben.

88
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,030
There's some girl that really likes him,

89
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,800
but of course Manny's not interested in her.

90
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,470
He's got to go for the head cheerleader.

91
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,600
How do you know that Amy's the head cheerleader?

92
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,410
I overheard that, too.

93
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,520
For someone whose favorite words at the movies

94
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,940
are, "What did he say?"

95
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,700
you overhear pretty good.

96
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,580
Yes, Lily, I-I pinky-promise

97
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,620
that we'll be home in time for baby Joe's party.

98
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,380
I am. I'm touching to the phone.

99
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah, and butterfly kisses.

100
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,440
Okay, okay.

101
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,110
Little girls -- so excitable.

102
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,900
I was wishing they had a gazebo, and then they did!

103
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,940
Ever since I was a little boy, I have dreamed --

104
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,960
dreamed of getting married in a place exactly like this.

105
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
So, what date were you looking at?

106
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,840
March 28th.

107
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,440
That's the anniversary of our first date.

108
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,010
Oh, wait, um, I'm sorry. Is this price per person?

109
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,010
Yes, excluding alcohol, cake, and music.

110
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,860
What's that -- the Mennonite package?

111
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,790
I think you'll find our prices are competitive.

112
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,060
Well, I'm ready to commit.

113
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,440
Cam, Cam.

114
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,290
I'm sorry.

115
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,140
Can -- can we have a moment, please?

116
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,340
Okay, well, let's hope he's not having any last-minute jitters.

117
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,640
You're not having last-minute jitters, are you?

118
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
No, no, but it's a really large deposit,

119
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,330
and I want to make sure

120
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,730
that we're absolutely certain about this place.

121
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,480
Well, I'm certain,

122
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,120
and we've looked at every possible venue.

123
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,680
And Pepper was by far the least snarky

124
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,570
about this one.

125
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,600
That's true.

126
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,500
He doesn't throw the word "Adequate" around lightly.

127
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,680
- Okay, okay, it's this place. - Okay.

128
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,030
But stop being so excited, all right?

129
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,590
We might be able to get the price down a little bit.

130
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,330
Okay, okay, poker face, poker face.

131
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,410
- Yeah, now work on your poker voice. - Poker voice.

132
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,430
So, we do like it.

133
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,060
We're just not sure that we love it.

134
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,120
Yeah, we're not sure we love it.

135
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,460
Oh, that's a relief

136
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,510
because someone just called.

137
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,640
- The room is booked. - What?!

138
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,620
No, no, no! Okay, wait,

139
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,370
are you playing hardball?

140
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,540
Because we're playing hardball, too!

141
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,400
We love it!

142
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,160
Oh, s-sorry.

143
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,750
A young lady planning a sweet 16

144
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,160
just booked your date.

145
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,710
After that, we don't have another opening for...

146
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,440
- two months. - No.

147
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,210
No, it has to be on our anniversary.

148
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,110
Wait, did Tracy Mccoy book this room?

149
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,210
Tracy Mccoy's a student of mine.

150
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,260
Okay, I may have a plan.

151
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,910
I am not having a wedding/"Hunger games"-themed

152
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,800
sweet 16 par--

153
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
oh, you're tapping your fingers.

154
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,530
You really do have a plan.

155
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,200
Well, somebody smells good.

156
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,770
What perfume is that?

157
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,980
Every perfume!

158
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,660
20 of the sweatiest, geekiest girls

159
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,380
God ever fouled this planet with

160
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,560
and just me dancing with all of them!

161
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,750
During the charleston,

162
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,600
my hair got caught in one of their headgear!

163
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,590
Wow, Charleston on the first day?

164
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,770
Last day!

165
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,040
Just because you're a dancer

166
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,630
doesn't mean I have to be one, too, cha cha cha.

167
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,540
Damn it!

168
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,990
I'm never gonna fall for one of your lies again.

169
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,000
Just take me to autopsy camp.

170
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,800
Oh, shoot. Am I gonna get a ticket?

171
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,350
If there's any justice,

172
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,240
it'll be a big one, two, three, and four.

173
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,220
Damn it!

174
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,020
License and registration, please.

175
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,770
Absolutely. There you are.

176
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,260
You know one of your taillights is out?

177
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,280
No, I did not. What a ding-dong!

178
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,850
Wait right here.

179
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,840
Will do. We'll be right here.

180
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,190
This is what you get for lying to me.

181
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,170
What choice did I have? You used to be up for anything.

182
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,470
Now, no matter what I suggest, it's no, no, no.

183
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,740
It's called growing up and having your own interests,

184
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,850
like the minister's daughter

185
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,290
in your precious "Footloose."

186
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,920
Wow, using my own movie against me.

187
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,610
Let's hear it for the boy.

188
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,920
Please step out of the car.

189
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
Oh, I believe you about the taillight.

190
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,910
- Out of the car! - Okay.

191
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,370
I'm sorry, but I have to place you under arrest.

192
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,610
Wait, what?!

193
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,010
A car registered to you

194
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,720
has accumulated 18 unpaid parking violations...

195
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,870
all on campus drive.

196
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,910
Oh, my god, those are my daughter's tickets!

197
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,530
He's got an answer for everything.

198
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,030
I got to take you down to the station house.

199
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,980
You can ride up front with me.

200
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,640
Seriously, can't I just pay you for them now?!

201
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,930
At the station house, sir.

202
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,800
Can we at least not drive by middle earth comics

203
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,990
and trampoline world?!

204
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,100
People look up to me in this town!

205
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,300
No, honey, Luke's fine.

206
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,650
And they won't take a credit card?

207
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,010
No, it's $1,600, cash only.

208
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,930
But, honey, it's Sunday.

209
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,140
I can only get a few hundred bucks from the ATM.

210
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,800
Sir, your time's up.

211
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,990
Honey, just use the emergency cash, okay?

212
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,700
- Tick-Tock. -Uh, b-but, Phil --

213
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,880
- Got to go! - No, honey --

214
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,550
I forgot the hiding place! Phil?

215
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,100
Phil has $1,000 hidden in the house,

216
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,110
and he's made up a crazy mnemonic device

217
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,230
to remember the location,

218
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,790
which he changes every month to stay ahead of the bad guys.

219
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,980
What bad guys?

220
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,150
"Loot" rhymes with "Coot,"

221
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,810
which takes us to...

222
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,870
this picture of your grandfather.

223
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,630
"Moola" sounds like "Coola."

224
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,300
Not a word.

225
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,220
Money is in the air-conditioning vent.

226
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,310
This will all be over soon, buddy.

227
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,750
Just give me one last smile!

228
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,730
You too.

229
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,890
Mom's already on her way with the money, okay? Don't worry!

230
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,660
Oh, my god, I don't want to go in there!

231
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,560
You're going in here.

232
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,120
I don't want to go in here!

233
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,830
Okay. This is where Sophie works.

234
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,770
She's the one in the hat.

235
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,260
- Copy that. - Tracy works upstairs.

236
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,330
We'll meet in the food court in 30 minutes. Sound like a plan?

237
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,620
A plan, not sure if it's a finger-drumming plan.

238
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,590
Get in there.

239
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,720
Two of my students, Tracy and Sophie, BFFs,

240
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,600
were planning on having a joint sweet 16 together

241
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,390
until they got in a fight over a boy, Rodney.

242
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,690
Now Tracy is planning on having her own party

243
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,890
at the carriage house.

244
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,250
Our venue, our date.

245
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,630
So, our solution -- talk to them, patch things up

246
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,390
so that they have their party together again

247
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,910
at the original location.

248
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,980
Friends fighting over a boy --

249
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,670
something we know a thing or two about.

250
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,930
Of course, usually it's gay men, not teenage girls,

251
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,920
so we will have to adjust our approach just a -- not at all.

252
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,670
I don't know.

253
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,110
Uh, may I help you?

254
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,010
Mm, yeah, uh, Sophie.

255
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,240
Um, I'm looking for something for my niece.

256
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,840
She's been really bummed out lately --

257
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,150
fight with her best friend -- so I'm just --

258
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,410
I'm trying to cheer her up.

259
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,080
That's so nice.

260
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,050
Yeah, she's always saying to me,

261
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,450
"Uncle Mitch, you're so cool. You're so rad.

262
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,690
I'm so glad I talk to you about my problems."

263
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,880
You know, I just -- I really get kids that age.

264
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,390
You know, she's -- she's almost 16, so...

265
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,770
I'm almost 16.

266
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,670
Crazy.

267
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,250
Tracy?

268
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,890
Tracy McCoy?

269
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,600
Mr. Tucker, hi.

270
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,510
I didn't know you were old enough to have a job.

271
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,420
I didn't have a job until I was 16.

272
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,260
Well, I'm almost 16, so...

273
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,390
Crazy!

274
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,410
Oh, my gosh, I remember back then.

275
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,040
My friends and I had so much fun,

276
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
well, when we weren't arguing

277
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,430
about silly things like parties and...

278
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,520
Okay, that's a lot of mirror looking,

279
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,430
and that's me saying that.

280
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,700
Good, good.

281
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,210
Nice cruising speed.

282
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,700
Oh, look, there's that jogger.

283
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,860
Now we're in the lead.

284
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,280
Can we put the brakes on the sarcasm?

285
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,470
They're worn out.

286
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,290
Hey, mom.

287
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,740
Haley, listen to me.

288
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,050
You did not pay a bunch of parking tickets,

289
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,070
and now your father is in jail.

290
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,440
And I have to go bail him out

291
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,220
just as soon as I can get my hands on a giant pile of cash.

292
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,850
Cash -- ash!

293
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,750
Oh! Oh, god.

294
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,180
Oh! That was furry!

295
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,270
You are in so much trouble.

296
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,520
Oh, don't you think I know that?!

297
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,700
What am I gonna do?!

298
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
You're going to get what you deserve.

299
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,530
A parking violation is second only to a moving violation,

300
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,870
which is grounds for the loss of a driving privilege.

301
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Privilege, not a right.

302
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,540
Oh, my god, shut up!

303
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,490
This is why mom pays me to drive with you!

304
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,250
What?

305
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,600
Where do you think she's calling me from --

306
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,190
the closet and blinds union?

307
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,940
Why would closet workers and blind people

308
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,280
even have a union together?!

309
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,380
Think!

310
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,720
Excuse me, waiter.

311
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,970
Could you please tell me about the surf and turf?

312
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,250
Mr. Lobster says...

313
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,070
"It's terrible!"

314
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,690
While Mr. Cow goes...

315
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,810
"I think you should probably just have the pasta."

316
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,910
Dada.

317
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,350
No, no, no, little man.

318
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,790
That's your dada right there with the drinky.

319
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,200
Over-explaining.

320
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
Don't feel bad. He's just making sounds.

321
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,220
He may not even know what the "D" word means.

322
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,620
I'm fine. He's 1.

323
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,570
I've watched him pee into his own face and smile.

324
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,080
Hola, mi amor.

325
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,570
I wanted to talk to you.

326
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,570
What are you doing?

327
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,180
I decided to top Amy's little "Forgotten Coat" trick

328
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,870
with a romantic gesture of my own.

329
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,620
You see --

330
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,660
Yes, about Amy...

331
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,570
I know that I don't know her,

332
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,290
But she seems like some of those girls that you have liked,

333
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,490
but they haven't always--

334
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,540
You may not know her, but I do.

335
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,880
I went on her Facebook page,

336
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,350
and I put one of her favorite things

337
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,850
in each of the pockets of her coat.

338
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,480
So when she reaches inside--

339
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,050
she'll find a small box of Dutch chocolates.

340
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,900
Sweet, but --

341
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,910
Raspberry rhapsody lip gloss, anyone?

342
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,120
My favorite, but I still wonder--

343
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,320
Hello, heavenly soak bath salts.

344
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,800
What next will she find?!

345
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,730
Only a lily of the valley scented candle.

346
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,060
I love it!

347
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,180
Oh, I wish she had more pockets!

348
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,630
"Bucks" rhymes with "Nyuks" --

349
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,220
Three Stooges.

350
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,480
Damn it!

351
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,820
"Wampum," "Pom-pom" --

352
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,130
Cheerleading costume.

353
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,610
Come on. Oh, my god, really?

354
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,820
"Bank," "Sank" --

355
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,770
Novelization of the movie "Titanic."

356
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,750
Then why do we keep that thing?!

357
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,430
Oh, Phil, of course!

358
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,970
Of course, because "Dough" rhymes with--

359
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,860
I don't care.

360
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,840
I don't care.

361
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,170
Hi, buddy.

362
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,950
Who am I?

363
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,370
Who am I?

364
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,340
Come on.

365
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,120
He's your dad.

366
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,550
That's right. He's your dad.

367
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,790
Hi, dad. Hi, dad.

368
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,670
You can do it.

369
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,080
Come on, say, "Dad."

370
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,460
Come on.

371
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,830
Come on!

372
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,580
Andy!

373
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,490
Hey. How'd it go with Sophie?

374
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,830
I did my best, but I don't think she's ready to forgive.

375
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,050
Oh, damn it.

376
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,660
I know. We're screwed.

377
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,260
Yeah, thanks a lot, Sophie.

378
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,360
Well, Tracy really was out of line.

379
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,960
- Was she? - Yeah.

380
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,660
Or was Sophie, per usual, being a big drama queen?

381
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,720
Drama queen?

382
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,090
No, Tracy was spreading rumors

383
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,000
that Sophie's boyfriend was still into Maya.

384
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,900
They weren't rumors.

385
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,550
She heard it directly from someone

386
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,550
who saw Maya and Rodney holding hands at the pier.

387
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,000
Cam, who? Dana!

388
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,040
Yeah, like she can be trusted.

389
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,370
This is Aidan all over again.

390
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,840
Mitchell, it's from Tracy.

391
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,970
"Mr.Tucker, thank you.

392
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,320
"Talked to Sophie.

393
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,330
Party's back on."

394
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,110
Are you kidding me?

395
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,230
Oh, my gosh, you're an evil genius!

396
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,430
You are! You know what?

397
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,690
I give Tracy a lot of credit for admitting she was wrong. I do.

398
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,610
Yeah, even though it was Sophie's fault.

399
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,650
- No! - Hmm? What?

400
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,280
They're still using our venue!

401
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,410
No! Are you kidding me?!

402
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,260
- This is so frustrating! - Really?

403
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,250
Are you sure that's how you feel,

404
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,190
or do you need a little more time to think about it?

405
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,470
Sounds like you're trying to make a point there.

406
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,730
Wow, I'm surprised you picked up on that so quick.

407
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,390
Yeah, you're definitely dancing around something.

408
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,780
I feel like it's speed-related.

409
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,850
Yeah, we lost the carriage house because you,

410
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,500
true to form,

411
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,110
couldn't make a timely decision.

412
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,250
We were out of the room for two second--

413
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,590
What is this "True to form" business?

414
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,510
28 Richdale Road.

415
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,120
Oh, my god, are you kidding me?

416
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,900
You hemmed and hawed over our dream house,

417
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,200
and now somebody else is eating breakfast in our nook!

418
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,230
I needed the weekend!

419
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,710
I never saw myself in a ranch!

420
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,630
And what about Las Vegas

421
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,610
when you couldn't quite commit to the show?

422
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,530
No. No, no, don't.

423
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,840
No, no, no, it's fine.

424
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,870
We'll see them next time,

425
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,370
just as soon as that tiger un-eats Roy.

426
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,600
I love the sign!

427
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,150
Uh, I'm not sure.

428
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,420
First, I thought just a little accent of color

429
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,490
was all it needed, but now I'm thinking balloons.

430
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,210
Jay, what do you like better--

431
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,700
the accent or the balloons?

432
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,350
I've been asking myself that since I met you.

433
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,910
Can I just say,

434
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,760
I want this type of playful banter in my relationship.

435
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,930
As long as you say it someplace else.

436
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,190
Good one.

437
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,390
What are you doing? They're gonna be here any moment.

438
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,320
I've been combing through Manny's yearbook.

439
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,400
I found a few girls he might have a shot with.

440
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,870
Happen to know what Lisa Nagel's like from the neck down?

441
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,910
I didn't tell him what you told me to say.

442
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,320
What? Why?

443
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Because he told me what he's going to do when Amy comes here,

444
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,920
and it's beautiful.

445
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,570
I think he has a better chance than you think.

446
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,870
He knows how to talk to girls.

447
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,520
He knows how to talk to a girl

448
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,220
-- you.

449
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,290
I hope you have a recent picture of his heart.

450
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,080
You're gonna need it putting the pieces back together.

451
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,630
I'll get it!

452
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,870
Hey, Mandrake.

453
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,290
Hi, Phil. I heard about jail.

454
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,960
- How are you doing? - It was rough.

455
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,850
Stayed in that cold cell

456
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,210
a lot longer than I needed to thanks to my lovely --

457
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,590
Your system is ridiculous, Phil.

458
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,990
Quite simple, actually!

459
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,350
"Cheddah" rhymes with "Hedda."

460
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,080
Where do you rest your head on? Your pilla!

461
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,670
- Help me out, buddy. - I have no buddy.

462
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,290
But... Luke?

463
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,510
I'll get it!

464
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,060
Would you please just let it go?

465
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,190
I did let it go immediately.

466
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,130
You're the one who hesitated,

467
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,020
like you do with everything.

468
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,700
The whole way here.

469
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,080
Dad, before you get mad, I'm --

470
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,740
Oh, we passed "Before I get mad" hours ago

471
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,350
when I was sitting in solitary for your crime!

472
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,790
It was only solitary because no one else was in there.

473
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,870
You paid Haley to take me driving?

474
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,910
Uh -- that's right.

475
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,220
Haley told me everything!

476
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,430
You made up a fake union

477
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,600
just so you wouldn't have to be with me?!

478
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,510
Alex, I am so sorry.

479
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,920
Haley, I trusted you.

480
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,100
Good luck trusting anyone in this family,

481
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,290
especially dad.

482
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,730
Usually when I drag you kicking and screaming to something,

483
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,050
you thank me afterwards.

484
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,410
This time, I was wrong.

485
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,480
What did he do?

486
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,200
He lied me into a dance class.

487
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,930
Luke, I am so sorry.

488
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,060
Haley, you are in so much trouble!

489
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,170
So much trouble!

490
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,010
Stop trying to make this her fault!

491
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,710
What kind of parents lie to their kids?!

492
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,860
Yeah, what kind of lesson is that to teach all of this?

493
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,850
Yeah, seriously, sometimes I want --

494
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,160
Hey, neither one of you knows the whole story.

495
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,630
Ah, please.

496
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,580
Let me tell them the truth.

497
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,040
Alex, the real reason

498
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,230
mom doesn't want to teach you to drive

499
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,190
is because she doesn't want you getting your license.

500
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,140
- What? - Think about it.

501
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,940
Mom driving you around is kind of her favorite time with you.

502
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,470
It's the only place where your nose isn't buried in a book

503
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,630
and she can actually talk to you.

504
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,830
Sure, you're getting your license,

505
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,020
but she's losing her little girl.

506
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,260
Mom, is that true?

507
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,980
Come here.

508
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,140
And the only reason dad lied to you is...

509
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,000
Should I tell him, dad?

510
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,900
Fine.

511
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,000
Dad was a huge nerd in college.

512
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,360
He asked mom out like 10 times, and she always said no.

513
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,960
Finally, he said, "I'll never bug you again

514
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,900
- if you do one thing." - Just one.

515
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,760
- "Dance with me." - Just dance.

516
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,430
He spun her around on the floor

517
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,380
and expressed himself with his body

518
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,410
- in a way he never could with words. - That's beautiful.

519
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,720
Mom finally saw the dad

520
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,400
that we all know and love.

521
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,690
And you wanted to give that to me?

522
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,950
Come here.

523
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,870
Everybody, come for cake!

524
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,750
We can discuss my punishment later.

525
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,390
Did she learn that from us?

526
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,550
That can't be taught. It is a gift.

527
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,660
Yeah, she's still doing it,

528
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,100
following me around all moony-eyed.

529
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,600
She just won't get the message.

530
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,800
But on the bright side, Amy's on her way over.

531
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,850
We need to talk.

532
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,270
Got to go, Reuben.

533
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,720
- What's up? - It's about your love life.

534
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,870
A lot of people here, Jay.

535
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,690
Consider it an intervention.

536
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,620
Now, this whole Amy thing is going nowhere,

537
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,250
but it sounds like you have a girl that really likes you.

538
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,260
Now, I know it's not everything you want.

539
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,980
M-maybe she's a little thick in the middle.

540
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,180
I don't know.

541
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,310
But why don't you give her a try?

542
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,500
So you think that's the girl I should go for?

543
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,050
She's obviously crazy about you.

544
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,190
I mean, what else do you even know about her?

545
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,030
Hi, Manny.

546
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,700
Well, she's 6 and related to me.

547
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,910
Shall I go on?

548
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,090
Okay, that explains all the outfits

549
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,220
she rejected this morning.

550
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,100
The point remains.

551
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,900
You could lower your sights a little.

552
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,410
Good, we're still talking about this.

553
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,850
Ay, leave him alone.

554
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,830
When Amy comes, she's going to love her coat surprise.

555
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,800
Who's Amy?

556
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,380
This girl Jay doesn't think is into me,

557
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,470
but she left her coat here.

558
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,750
Why else would a person do that?

559
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,510
By that logic, I love Denny's.

560
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,930
Even if she's not into me right away,

561
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,880
isn't it possible she could fall for me over time?

562
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,800
No, there's a thing called chemistry.

563
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,260
People know right away.

564
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,830
Not necessarily.

565
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,180
I didn't know immediately that I liked you.

566
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,730
Well, maybe not the first minute.

567
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,730
One month.

568
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,120
A month? Yikes.

569
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,090
I'm with Manny.

570
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,770
Some people can trust their instincts

571
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,040
and leap in with both feet.

572
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,740
Others need to take their time.

573
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,480
Okay, what Cam is so subtly implying

574
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,140
is that he knew instantly with me

575
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,090
while I, as usual, took my sweet time.

576
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,920
Well, guess what.

577
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,330
I knew instantly with you.

578
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,480
How about that?

579
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,490
- Actually, I didn't. - Okay, well, yes,

580
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,210
if you count that one disastrous brunch, then --

581
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,600
- two months. - Two months?!

582
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,650
- Mm-hmm. - Yikes!

583
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,990
Well, I'm in the Jay camp.

584
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,050
When you meet the right person, bang!

585
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,580
That's what happened with -- How long?

586
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,130
Uh...six months?

587
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,870
Six months -- Yikes.

588
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,430
But you were preg-- tically engaged to me by then.

589
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,950
Mm, nice save, dad.

590
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,640
Wait a minute.

591
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,950
I thought you fell in love with him

592
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,890
after he danced with you.

593
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,580
And that was six months in.

594
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,730
Why did it take you so long to dance with me, Phil?

595
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,400
I don't know, Claire.

596
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
You'd think I would've gotten to it by then

597
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,110
since we lived together.

598
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,270
I'm sorry. I've been berating you about dragging your feet, and,

599
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,390
and when it comes to us,

600
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,750
I'm even more hesitate-y than --

601
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,680
No, no, this is great because

602
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,130
that makes our real anniversary

603
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,700
two months later when we were both sure.

604
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,920
We can still book the carriage house for our wedding.

605
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,960
Oh, my gosh, are you calling them?

606
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,190
- Yes! - Yes!

607
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,190
Although, I-I am --

608
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,430
- Call them. - Okay.

609
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,110
So, you were living with this guy the whole time...

610
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,030
- Jay! - Aww, how cute!

611
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,280
He wants cake!

612
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,490
No, no, listen, listen, listen!

613
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,610
What's he saying?

614
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,700
- Jay. - Jay!

615
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,350
He's saying, "Jay"!

616
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,750
He knows me!

617
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,410
And that "J" word, that's harder to say than "Dada"!

618
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,360
He's a genius. Come here.

619
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,480
She's here!

620
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,540
This is it, Manny!

621
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,800
Go get her, buddy!

622
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,380
Hey, hey, hey, listen, kid.

623
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,920
Y-you might've been right about some people

624
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,260
needing a little more time before they come around.

625
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,660
I mean, look at peanut here.

626
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,630
Good luck, Manny.

627
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,010
Thanks, Jay.

628
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,880
So, it took you six months, huh, Phil?

629
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,190
I can do six months.

630
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,140
I'll be here!

631
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,670
I'm not loving this.

632
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,820
His door is still closed.

633
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,610
What is he doing in there?

634
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,260
I think we both know what he's doing in there.

635
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,730
He's been at it for hours.

636
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,350
That's how I was at his age.

637
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,720
He's gonna wear himself out.

638
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
You should talk to him.

639
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,300
I don't want to embarrass him.

640
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,880
- So, knock first. - Maybe you're right.

641
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,810
I don't want him doing it wrong and getting hurt.

642
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,950
Luke?

643
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,950
I'm coming in.

644
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,680
Hey, man. Buddy!

645
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,340
Dad?! Get out of here!

646
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,610
Don't be embarrassed, son. It's perfectly natural!

647
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,700
Get out!
