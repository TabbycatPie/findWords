1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,740
如果我吃点什么来催眠
If I take something to help me sleep,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,130
明天开会就会昏昏沉沉的
I'll be groggy for the meeting.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,500
但如果我什么也不吃  就睡不着
But if I don't take anything and I don't sleep,

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,400
明天开会还是会昏昏沉沉的
I'll be groggy for the meeting, you know?

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,500
我在再次竞选当地房地产经纪人团体的
I was up for re-election as social chair

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,140
联谊会主席
of our local realtors group.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,720
今晚进行投票
The vote was tonight.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,610
我超级紧张
I was so nervous,

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,010
基本没在听克莱尔为我鼓励
I could barely hear Claire's pep talk.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,990
我为什么求米奇尔
Why did I beg Mitchell

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,770
介绍我认识这个开发商
to introduce me to this developer?

12
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,500
你说得对  我们很快就会知道了
You're right. We'll know soon enough.

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,570
我要上楼了  看看能不能睡着
I'm gonna go upstairs, see if I can get some sleep.

14
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,650
爱你
Love you.

15
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,100
我也希望这样
I hope so, too.

16
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,680
你好
Hello?

17
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,880
格尔
Hey, Gil.

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,670
没没没  你没吵醒我
No, no, no. You -- you didn't wake me.

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,490
你有听到什么消息吗
Um, so, you hear anything, or...

20
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,330
邓菲
Hey, Dunphy.

21
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,200
稍等我挂断这个蠢货的电话
Just wrapping up a phone call with this jackass.

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,890
我得挂了  邓菲
I got to run, Dunphy.

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,830
晚上得跟个蠢货见面
I got a late meeting with some jackass.

24
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,770
什么情  什么情况
What's going o-- what's going on?

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,680
大家都表态了  邓菲
The people have spoken, Dunphy.

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,230
我当选了  你出局了
I'm in. You're out.

27
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,200
很抱歉不得不私下告诉你
Sorry to have to tell you that in private.

28
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,480
票数接近吗
Was it even close?

29
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,630
不  我现在受命要做个工作
No! I have a mandate --

30
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,550
不是需要跟老婆隐瞒的那种
Not the kind you hide from your wife, either.

31
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,960
难以置信  我才任一届吗
I can't believe it. I'm a one-termer?

32
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,980
那我就跟亨利・尤斯塔斯・泰勒
That puts me alongside Henry Eustace Tyler

33
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,300
还有阿特・瓦格纳一样了
and Art Wagner!

34
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,580
从没见过阿特・瓦格纳
Never met Art Wagner.

35
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,340
"Gategate"事件后 他的经纪人执照被吊销了
They took away his realtor's license after Gategate.

36
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,310
别再追忆历史了  "蹬腿"
Okay, enough history, "Done-for."

37
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,780
快把东西交出来
Fork over the hardware.

38
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,890
格尔 正如我的前任对我说的那样
Gil, as my predecessor told me,

39
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,240
尊重办公室  尊重奖章
respect the office, respect the medallion.

40
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,140
真够闪的
Ooh, shiny.

41
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,400
你多长时间清理一次这玩意儿
How often do you clean this thing?

42
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,780
我每次洗澡的时候
Every time I shower.

43
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,010
别担心 晚上这奖章
Well, don't worry. It's gonna get a good buffing tonight

44
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,000
在我老婆脑后摇晃时就能好好磨光一下了
when it's swinging against the back of my wife's head.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,690
这可不是尊重奖章的表现

我不会缠着你
I'm not going to be all over you,

63
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,460
让你感觉压抑的
trying to suffocate you.

00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,740
别那样说话
Don't talk like that.

65

我讨厌拥挤的电梯
I hate crowded elevators.

66
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,940
只有一件事更讨厌
Only one thing worse --

67
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,230
那就是电梯停了  你被困在里面
When they stop and you get trapped.

68
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,200
其实  还有一件事更讨厌
Actually, there's one thing even worse than that.

69
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,250
没关系  先生  不用怕
It's okay, sir. There's no need to panic.

70
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,940
跟他一起被困住
Getting trapped with him.

他跟我同个俱乐部的
He belongs to my club.

73
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,920
但不知道为什么
But for whatever reason,

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,870
他总是有办法
he has the knack for showing up

75
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,900
在我最糟糕的时候出现
when I'm at my absolute worst.

76
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,060
马上回来
Be right back.

显然  他是个大咖

不  奥斯卡是靠实力赢的
No, you win an Oscar.

I'll -- I-I'll take her to the park. That's good.

你还记得我们以前总叫你小迟钝吗

现在我还是可以取消这次会面
and I can still cancel this meeting.

好吧  我得挂了  我得

我不知道我得干什么
I don't know what I have to do.

104
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,380
这是干什么
What is this?

105
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,630
我在为了我的摔跤比赛流汗减重
I'm sweating off weight for my wrestling match.

106
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,890
我就是穿这个睡觉的
I slept in this.

107
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,390
这就是为什么我们找不到塑料包装用吗
Does this have anything to do with why we're out of plastic wrap?

108
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,740
那是最里面一层
Oh, it's the bottom layer.

109
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,890
而且我告诉你吧
And I've got some news for you --

110
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,940
那东西并不能让我保持新鲜
It's not keeping me fresh.

111
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,390
好吧  你要迟到了
Okay. Um, you're gonna be late.

112
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,210
你在后座脱衣服吧
You got to get undressed in the backseat.

113
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,840
要给他什么指示吗
Ooh, got any pointers for him?

114
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
你们非得现在搬这个吗
Do you girls have to move that now?

115
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,190
我最近感觉很孤单
Well, I've been lonely.

116
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,370
屋子放面镜子会让我感觉有个伴
Having a mirror in my room will be like having company!

117
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,050
你女儿真是只害怕孤独的小鹦鹉
Ugh, your daughter's a parakeet.

118
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,470
小心点
Careful.

119
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,270
别再说了  我知道我在
Stop saying that. I think I know what I'm --

120
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,150
等一下
Oh, one second.

121
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,000
-天啊  -你好
- Oh, my God.  - Hello!

122
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,840
不会  现在正合适
No, this is a good time.

123
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,890
-海莉  -好了  天啊
- Haley!  - All right. Geez!

124
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,670
没事  我在帮我妹妹做点事儿
No, I just got to help my sister out with something.

125
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,830
再见
Okay. Bye.

126
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,210
我们把这个放下一会儿
Okay, let's just put this down for a second.

127
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,380
天啊
Oh, my God.

128
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,900
-怎么了  -恐怕这面镜子放不下
- What?  - I don't think this is gonna fit.

129
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,380
你得找一面小点的镜子
You'll have to get a smaller mirror.

130
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,860
天啊  天啊  天啊
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

131
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,600
海莉  换面镜子你身材又不会变
Haley, you'll still be the same size in it.

132
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,750
不
No!

133
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,280
天呐  我们被困住了
Oh, my God! We're trapped!

134
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,020
这  这  这没什么大不了的
Well, it -- it's -- it's not such a huge disaster.

135
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,510
只是你上学会迟到一会儿而已
You know, you'll just be a little late for school.

136
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,010
再好好想想  到底是哪样
Make up your mind! Which is it?!

137
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,430
天呐  我错过了一条短信
Oh, my god. I'm missing a text.

138
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,910
来真的了  是不是
Just got real, didn't it?

139
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,420
谁派你来的
Who sent you?!

140
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,560
快点  我们得走了  可不能迟到
Come on. We have to go. We can't be late.

141
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,750
我太激动了  你呢
I am so excited. Aren't you?

142
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,570
-不是吧  -什么  怎么了
- Oh, no. - What? What's happening?

143
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,690
又要搞砸吗
How are you ruining this?

144
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,260
莉莉的班上有虱子
There's a report of lice in Lily's class.

145
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,350
估计是从波西亚那传来的
Ugh. It's probably from Portia.

146
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,970
她总是特别脏
You know, she is always so filthy.

147
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,380
他们不跟她一起游泳了
They had to kick her out of swim buddies

148
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,530
因为她有次落了个游泳圈在泳池周围
because she left a ring around the pool.

149
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,040
我们大概应该取消会议
We should probably cancel our meeting

150
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,110
亲自去接莉莉
and pick Lily up ourselves, huh?

151
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,570
不是大概  是必须
Probably? We have to!

152
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,840
我们不能为了
We can't risk infecting Claire

153
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,910
和全国最棒的婚礼摄影师见面
just so we can keep a meeting

154
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,860
就让克莱尔有被传染虱子的风险
with the top wedding photographer in the state.

155
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,210
不  不
No. No.

156
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,450
我这就打给她
I am calling her.

157
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,270
没错  这就对了
Yeah, it's the right thing to do...

158
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,710
即使基本没可能
...even though it's like a 1% chance

159
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,030
会传染给她
of her actually catching anything

160
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,330
倒是很可能吓死她
and a 100% chance of us freaking her out.

161
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,150
别  等等
Well, now, wait.

162
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,340
我们是不是有点自私  小卡
Are we being selfish here, Cam?

163
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,600
也许  说下去
Maybe. Go on.

164
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,270
要是我们提醒她
Well, if-- if we alarm her just so

165
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,730
只是为了不让自己良心不安
that we can have a clear conscience,

166
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,260
会不会显得我们太
doesn't that make us...

167
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,870
-冷酷  -冷酷
- Monsters.   - ...monsters.

168
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,240
我们何不帮她个忙
Wouldn't we be doing her a favor

169
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,720
就不告诉她  省得她担心呢
by not telling her and sparing her all that worry?

170
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,950
今天帮她的第二个大忙
Second huge favor of the day,

171
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,870
你还帮她约了你的客户和她见面
after you got her a meeting with your client.

172
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,280
我有点负罪感
Mm. I'm -- I'm starting to feel bad about this.

173
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,600
怎么了  因为我们帮了她太多忙
What, because we're doing so many favors,

174
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,540
可克莱尔却报答不了吗
Claire will never be able to pay us back?

175
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,430
谢谢
Thank you.

176
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,040
好  就不给她添加压力了  小卡
Nope, she does not need the stress, Cam.

177
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,120
好的  就这样  不再帮克莱尔了
Yep. That's it. No more favors for Claire.

178
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,190
不帮了
No!

179
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,230
看我们
Look at us!

180
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,700
两个金发女郎  真开心
Two blondes, having fun!

181
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,950
伙计
Hey, buddy!

182
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,980
比赛快开始了
My match is coming up.

183
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,380
有什么最后的"父建"
Got any final dad-vice?

184
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,030
这个词开始听习惯了吧
Starting to sound natural, right?

185
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,040
没别的  去好好享受比赛就好了
You know what? Just get out there and enjoy yourself.

186
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,370
你尝试了一项新的运动  很棒
You showed real character trying a new sport.

187
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,930
不管结果如何  我都为你骄傲
No matter what happens, I couldn't be prouder.

188
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,800
谢谢  爸爸
Thanks, dad.

189
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,970
加油  打败他们
You bet. Go get 'em!

190
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,710
这可能是当家长最棒的一件事
That may be the best part about being a parent.

191
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,420
不管你自己的生活如何
Whatever's going on in your personal life,

192
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,150
你的孩子高兴  你也会高兴
when your kid's happy, you're happy.

193
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,350
一个开心的孩子就像抗抑郁药
A happy kid is like an antidepressant,

194
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,440
而且是纯天然的
but a natural one,

195
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,620
不是需要背着老公藏在
not the kind your husband has to find

196
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,420
首饰盒里的那种
in your jewelry drawer.

197
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,440
说多了
Enough said about that!

198
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,620
格尔你好
Hey, Gil.

199
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,000
真抱歉啊
Oh, whoops! I'm sorry, man.

200
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,220
希望没晃瞎你眼睛
I hope I didn't blind ya.

201
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,690
尽管你可能不会想看接下来的画面
Although you might not want to see what's next.

202
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,600
我们的孩子要比赛摔跤
Our kids are wrestling each other.

203
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,060
-你在开玩笑吧  -没有
- Are you kidding?   - Nope!

204
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,980
那个就是我的小选手
There's my little bra-snapper right there.

205
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,020
他可是很生猛的
He's a beast, man.

206
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,100
是啊是啊
No, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

207
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,620
我明白
No, I get it.

208
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,280
你想吓唬我
This is when you try to intimidate me.

209
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,250
不不  祝你好运
No! No. Hey, good luck.

210
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,010
你听没听说过
Hey, did you ever hear about those

211
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,580
边境那些非法的童子摔跤比赛
illegal baby-fighting rings they got in the border?

212
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,620
那都是假的
That's not a real thing.

213
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,410
我和我太太带他去参加过
Yeah, wife and I brought him down there.

214
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,710
赢了一整车鸡回来
Won a whole carload of chickens.

215
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,290
回头见了伙计
See you out there, man.

216
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,510
那根本没有的事
That never happened!

217
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,240
注意  注意
Watch yourself! Watch yourself!

218
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,340
祝我好运吧
Wish me luck.

219
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,380
不需要了  你很努力了
No need. You worked hard.

220
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,570
我只希望你开心就好
I just want you to have fun.

221
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,350
谢谢  爸爸
Thanks, dad.

222
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,280
另外我还想修正一下
Also, I'd like to revise

223
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,120
我在车上跟你说的咬人的事
what I said to you in the car about biting.

224
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,420
曼尼  这里什么都有
Manny, they have everything here--

225
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,390
雨林体验  飓风室
the rainforest experience, the hurricane booth,

226
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,000
人体解析
discovering the body --

227
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,860
这个哥伦比亚也有  只是
We have that one in Colombia, too, but --

228
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,300
形式不同
but a different kind.

229
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,480
-不  -怎么了
- Oh, no.  - What?

230
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,580
你没听到吗
You don't hear that?

231
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,740
是我的新鞋  吱吱响
It's my new shoes. They're squeaking.

232
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,220
那就轻点走
Then walk softer.

233
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,370
完了
Oh, great.

234
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,110
地板就像猫玩具做的
It sounds like the floor's made of cat toys.

235
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,690
-我完了  -为什么
- I'm screwed!  - Why?

236
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,340
为什么  因为这些孩子会取笑任何事
Why? Because these kids make fun of everything.

237
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,730
让他们揪着这事  我会永世不得脱身
Hand them this, it'll stick with me forever.

238
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,480
咕哝就是这样
That's what happened to mumbles.

239
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,580
曼尼  来跟我们走
Hey, Manny, come with us.

240
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,060
走吧  咕哝
Let's go, mumbles.

241
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,770
就那一次
One time!

242
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,610
走吧
Let's go.

243
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,530
我不去了
Just go on without me.

244
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,700
我就在这站着吧
I'm just gonna stand here.

245
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,080
永远站着吗
What -- forever?

246
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,790
他这是怎么了
What happened to him?

247
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,630
上高中前  他没有这么强烈的
He didn't used to be that self-conscious

248
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,050
自我意识
before high school.

249
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,220
他以前就披着斗篷
He used to go around in his poncho,

250
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,940
吹着排箫
play the pan flute.

251
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,920
真想念我的小曼尼
Ay, I miss my little old Manny.

252
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,110
曼尼  你太在意别人怎么想了
Manny, you care too much about what other people think!

253
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,980
我知道这里有些母亲
I know that some of the mothers here

254
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,800
也想取笑我
want to make fun of me

255
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,480
因为我有口音和有弹性的胸部
because of my accent and my bouncy bosom.

256
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,770
可她们没有  知道为什么吗
But they don't. You know why?

257
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,890
因为我不在乎  因为我充满自信
Because I don't care. Because I walk with confidence.

258
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,580
你也可以  我们走
And so can you. Let's go.

259
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,590
这地方真差劲
This place sucks so bad.

260
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,780
可不是么  咯咯笑
Sure does, giggles.

261
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,950
我就那么笑了一次
One time!

262
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,230
好吧  她还没走
Okay, she's not leaving.

263
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,390
你得把她从楼梯上引开
You got to lure her away from the staircase.

264
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,080
她肯定相信你
She'll trust you.

265
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,570
你穿得像个驯兽员
You're kind of dressed like an animal trainer.

266
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,700
你为什么一直觉得它是母的
Why do you keep calling it a "She"?

267
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,180
因为公的不会那样看我
Well, because "He"s don't look at me like that.

268
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,800
天啊  她打算睡上一整天吗
My god, is she gonna sleep all day long?

269
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,300
真的吗  你还嫌人家睡得多
Okay, that, coming from you?

270
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,700
那负鼠肯定乐坏了
The possum's actually laughing.

271
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,510
而且  它显然没在睡觉
And, besides, I mean, it's obviously not sleeping.

272
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,250
她还能干什么
What else would she be doing?

273
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,820
装[玩]...
Playing...?

274
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,190
玩...什么
Playing...what?

Playing possum, the one thing

278
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,340
这是负鼠最擅长干的事
that absolutely everyone knows possums do.

279
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,770
骗到你了
Ha, ha! I got you!

280
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,970
我像负鼠那样跟你装傻呢  我假装
I was playing possum on you by pretending --

281
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,900
不  别糊弄我  想都不要想
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Don't even.

282
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,800
不  上帝啊
No, my god.

283
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,990
妈妈要到5点才能回家
Mom's not even here until 5:00.

284
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
你还把唯一一个能量棒给吃了
And you ate our only power bar.

285
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,010
可能就是那个把它吸引来的
Well, that's probably what attracted it!

286
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,450
我们得朝它扔点儿什么
You know, we got to throw something at it.

287
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,410
好吧
Fine.

288
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,070
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?!

289

博洛先生马上就来见您
Mr. Perlowe will be right with you.

290

-谢谢  -谢谢你
- Thank you. - Thank you.

291
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,670
我之前特别紧张  不过我觉得我能搞定
I was so nervous before, but I think I really got this.

292
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,100
不是吧
Oh, no!

293
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,190
什么  怎么了
What? What's happening?

294
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,310
又要搞砸吗
How are you ruining this?

295
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,900
为什么每个人都这么说我
Why does everybody say that?

那个  我们今早见的
The -- the director of photography

we met with this morning --he's turning us down.

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,820
为什么
Why?

299
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,680
创意分歧
"Creative differences."

300
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,380
他建议我们其中一人在襟花上
He suggested one of us wear a hidden camera

301
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,120
装个隐藏相机
in our boutonniere.

He called it "Groom with a view."

304
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,200
某人却想把它叫做"小卡摄影"
Somebody got it into his head to call it the "Cam-cam."

305
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,490
于是就有了各种跳脚
Then there was a lot of foot-stomping

306

折手杖  摔单眼镜
and cane-snapping and monocle-smashing.

我今天早上路过工地了
Listen, I went by the construction site this morning,

315

那些公寓肯定会建得非常棒

I would, but remember, the carpet's hot lava!

你知道吗  亲爱的
Well, you know what, sweetie?

347
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,000
好吧  不  保持镇定
All right. No. J-just stay calm.

348
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,870
首先 如果你需要我做什么
First of all, if there's anything that you need from me,

349
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,580
不管是什么
anything at all,

我就住在使馆套房
I will be living at the embassy suites.

其次  她也不一定
Secondly, there's -- there's no guarantee

352
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,420
会被传染上
that she has it.

353
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,960

I mean, I'm with her right now.

你怎么了
What is going on with you?

366
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,880
是这样  你发现你一直在挠头了吧
Okay, so, you know how you've been scratching your head?

367
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,170
我的天  有这么明显吗
Oh, god. Is it that noticeable?

368
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,780
我有点儿神经性痉挛
I-I have some kind of nervous tic.

369
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,530
是  可能也有这个原因
Yeah, there might be one of those in there, too.

那个  莉莉在学校染上虱子了
Um, so, lily brought home lice from school.

什么
What?

372
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,810
是的  事实上  我本来想告诉你的
Yeah, and, actually, I would've told you,

373

但小卡觉得也许
but Cam thought that maybe --

with insects gnawing on my skull,

竟然不告诉我吗
and you said nothing?

是  但是克莱尔
Yeah, but, Claire --

I feel you would've done the same thing.

384

-绝不会  -不  克莱尔  住手
- Never.   - No, Claire, stop it!

You got my business.

00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,560
真是太棒了
Oh, super!

00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,740
她应该是看到我跟她撞衫了
She probably saw she and I were wearing the same outfit

409
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,960
怕被我比下去  一直都这样
and didn't want to get outdone...as usual.

410
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,490
也许吧
Uh yeah, maybe.

411
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,810
最重要的是我
But the important thing

412
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,150
能够享受这个过程  对吧
is that I have fun out there, right?

413
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,360
我们再重复一遍
Okay, let's go over this again,

414
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,890
因为我觉得你没懂我的意思
'cause I feel like you're not listening.

415
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,760
你必须给我赢
I need you to win.

416
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,770
杰  你来了
Hey, Jay.

417
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,480
卢克
Hey, Luke.

418
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,800
别听你爸的
Don't let your dad get in your head.

419
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,490
尽力就行了
Get out there and do your best.

420
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,610
没问题
All right.

421
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,160
你到底在想什么
What the hell was that?

422
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,820
他的对手是格尔・索普的儿子
He's wrestling Gil Thorpe's kid.

423
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,880
我恨死那家伙了
I hate that guy.

424
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,580
总是想方设法让我自惭形秽
Always trying to make me feel like less of a man.

425
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,260
是拿走你的项链的那个家伙吗
The guy that took your necklace, right?

426
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,160
-那是我的奖牌  -随便你怎么叫
- My medallion! - Call it what you want.

427
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,020
我只是很高兴不用再帮你戴上它了
I'm just glad I don't have to help you with the clasp again.

428
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,740
杰  你在哭吗
Jay, are you crying?

429
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,250
当然不是
No!

430
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,770
裁判在座位区喷了消毒剂
Referee sprayed some disinfectant on the mats.

431
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,500
我弄到眼睛里了  你有纸巾吗
I got some in my eye. You got a tissue?

432
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,570
给你
Here you go.

433
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,710
送你了
Keep it.

434
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,760
那是我老婆的
It's my wife's.

435
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
-老爸  -儿子
- Hey, dad! - Hey, son!

436
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,110
你能来真好
Good to see you.

437
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,190
比赛快要开始了
Uh, the match is about to start... yeah?

438
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,800
也就是说  快要结束了
...which means it's about to finish.

439
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,670
他的对手看起来像棵矮牵牛花
You see that little petunia he's wrestling?

440
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,420
没错
Yes.

441
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,390
你认识格尔他爸吗
You know Gil's dad?

442
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,770
他总能看到我最糟糕的时刻
I know he always sees me at my worst.

443
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,280
这比赛一定要赢  菲尔
I really want this win, Phil.

444
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,700
非常非常想
I can taste it, like metal.

445
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,450
我也一样
Me, too. Metal.

446
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,930
我也搞不懂为什么
I don't know what it is with this guy,

447
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,910
但是不管我怎么做
but no matter what I do,

448
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,310
我就是赢不了他
I just can't win with him.

449
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,720
我跟他儿子也是这样的
That's the way I am with his son.

450
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,870
还有跟时代华纳电视公司打交道的时候
And Time Warner Cable.

451
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,580
感觉像被阉了一样憋屈
It's emasculating, you know?

452
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,510
这不是一个男人应该有的感觉
I mean, it's not a feeling a man should have.

453
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,180
杰  你知道爱的开头是什么吗
Jay, you know what the beginning of "Love" is?

454
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,470
上帝啊  我们只不过随便聊聊
Oh, for god's sake, we're just talking here.

455
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,870
为什么你总是要
Why do you always have to make everything

456
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,210
上纲上线
bigger than it is?!

457
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,410
你好[LO与Hello音似]
L.O.

458
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,820
菲尔  听我说
Hey, Phil, listen.

459
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,650
你的药店有卖治虱子的洗发水吗
Does your pharmacy carry lice shampoo?

460
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,150
莉莉在学校被传染了虱子
Lily got it at school.

461
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,730
走开  吓人的机器人
Ooh, away, scary robot!

462
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,630
走开
Away!

463
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,980
我不能呼吸了
I can't breathe.

464
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,540
很好  你头上的虫子也不能
Well, good. Neither can your hair pets.

465
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,840
-什么  -没事
- What?   - Nothing.

466
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,480
莉莉从什么人身上传染了虱子
Lily got lice from someone.

467
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,970
-肯定是波西亚  -还能是谁
- Portia. - Who else?

468
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,450
别去什么药店了
You know what? Skip the pharmacy.

469
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,870
我们那儿有治虱子的东西
Just -- just borrow our lice kit.

470
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,730
在地下室  钥匙在地毯下面
It's in the basement. The key's under the mat.

471
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,090
谢谢你  菲尔  谢谢
Thank you, Phil. Thanks.

472
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,170
好了
All right!

473
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,940
可以了  吓人的机器人
Enough.. with scary robot!

474
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,130
谁想扮成一只坐在车上的狗狗
But who wants to pretend to be a dog and ride in the car?

475
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,690
我
I do!

476
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,900
很好  我们门口见
Okay! Meet you at the door!

477
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,660
记着
And remember --

478
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,520
我们要把头伸出车窗外
we're gonna keep our head outside the window.

479
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,660
-真有趣  -是啊  真有趣
- Fun! - Yeah, fun! Uh-huh!

480
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
真是有趣
Fun.

481
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,980
好了  比赛开始了
All right, the match is starting.

482
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,170
我感觉到对胜利的渴望了
I feel that metal now in my mouth,

483
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,430
就像你之前说的一样
like you were saying.

484
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,360
万一他输了怎么办
What if he loses?

485
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,440
那也不要表现出失望
Then we hide our disappointment.

486
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,470
跟我学学  我都装了好多年了
Follow my lead. I've been doing it for years.

487
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,520
孩子需要知道我们永远无条件支持他
The kid needs to know we support him no matter what.

488
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,610
-加油卢克  -卢克加油
- Come on, Luke! - Luke!

489
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,030
[洛杉矶自然历史博物馆]

490
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,170
好了  他们走了
All right. They're gone.

491
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,480
好  我们赶紧走吧
Okay. Let's get out of here.

492
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,610
靠我近点
Stay close.

493
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,360
妈  你简直不可理喻[无与伦比]
Mom, you're unbelievable.

494
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,970
你真会说话  不过我知道我看起来很糟
Ay, that's sweet, but I know I look terrible.

495
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,540
你责备我自我意识太强
You come down on me for being self-conscious,

496
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,700
结果你自己因为脸变红了就躲起来
then you run and hide because your face is red.

497
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
你说得没错
You're right.

498
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,030
我一直怪其他高中生
I keep blaming the high-school boys

499
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,510
老是害你难为情
for making you self-conscious,

500
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,700
没想到是我造成的
and you're taking after me.

501
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,840
等我们躲到安全的地方之后
We can assign blame when we're safely

502
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,320
再互相指责吧
behind our tinted windows.

503
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,870
-我们被包围了  -才不是呢
- We're trapped! - No.

504
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,370
当我在洞穴人展区的时候
When I was in the caveman exhibit,

505
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,890
我发现了防火出口
I discovered fire exits.

506
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,310
上车以后我再跟你解释好笑在哪里
I'll explain to you why that's funny in the car.

507
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,950
跟我来
Follow me.

508
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,700
不行  曼尼
No, Manny.

509
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,090
是时候给你树立一个好榜样了
It's time for me to set a good example for you.

510
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,060
好吧
Okay.

511
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,090
妈  你要干嘛
Mom, what are you doing?

512
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,450
我要证明给你看别人的想法
I'm gonna show you that it's not important

513
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,700
并不重要
what other people think.

514
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,430
重要的是要坚持自我
What is important is that you stay true to yourself.

515
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,850
那是我妈妈做过最勇敢的事
It was the bravest thing my mom had ever done.

516
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,640
大家好
Hey, everybody!

517
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,070
听到我这个吱吱叫的鞋子了吗
Uh, hear my squeaky shoes?

518
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,370
太逗了  不是吗
Pretty funny, isn't it?

519
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,250
是啊  就是我  吱吱鞋
That's right, it's me -- ol' squeaky shoes.

520
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,390
太疯狂了
Crazy!

521
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,730
瞧瞧他那件粉衬衣
Get a load of that pink shirt.

522
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,820
真是太漂亮了
Aww, it's so pretty.

523
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,280
曼尼  上衣很美啊
Hey, Manny, nice top.

524
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,440
但你看我的鞋
Uh, but my shoes!

525
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,090
鞋怎么了  小粉红
What about 'em, pink top?

526
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,570
那是他做过最勇敢的事情
It was the bravest thing he has ever done.

527
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,370
他们叫我小粉红
They call me "Pink top."

528
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,880
我的英雄
My hero.

529
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,200
小粉红
Pink top.

530
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
比赛太棒了
Hey! Whoo! Good fight!

531
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,140
今天我们搞砸了卢克的比赛
We really blew it with Luke today.

532
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,430
我怎么可以那样做呢
How could I do that?

533
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,960
我父亲从来不错过任何机会让我知道
My dad never missed an opportunity to let me know

534
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,090
我让他失望了  我也这么对待我的外孙
when I disappointed him, and I do it to my grandkid.

535
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,220
我也做得不对
It's just as much my fault.

536
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,760
在我妻子身上  我清晰地看见了
I've seen what having a disapproving father

537
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,770
一个不认同她的父亲的危害
has done to my wife.

538
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,090
我应该做得更好的
I should've known better.

539
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,390
该死
Dang it.

540
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,850
伙计  我知道你不开心
Buddy, I know you're upset.

541
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,830
你绝对有权利那样
You've got every right.

542
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,800
我们把自己的争执发泄到摔跤比赛上
We made that wrestling match all about our stupid feud.

543
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,770
那是不对的
That was wrong.

544
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,050
忘了那些人渣吧
Forget about those jerks.

545
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,670
我们对你的感觉只有自豪
We couldn't be anything but proud of you,

546
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,720
就好像我特别为你妈妈感到自豪一样
just like I'm super proud of your mom.

547
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,680
我们先处理眼前这个问题吧
Let's repair this one first.

548
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,670
我们只是不想让你因为输了比赛
We just don't want you to beat yourself up

549
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,850
而感到自责
because you lost.

550
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,850
我没有
I'm not.

551
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,230
我刚开始学习摔跤不久
I just started wrestling.

552
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,220
当然  能赢固然好  但我尽力了
Sure, it would've been nice to win, but I tried my best.

553
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,680
我刚刚说"该死"  是因为忘了拿吸管
I just said "Dang it" Because I forgot to get a straw.

554
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,680
臭小子  他竟然没事
Son of a gun! He's actually okay.

555
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,720
我才不信
I don't buy it.

556
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,710
为什么  何出此言
Why? What are you talking about?

557
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,110
没有孩子可以在让父亲和外公失望后
No kid lets down his father and grandfather

558
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,360
还那么镇定自若
and is that okay with it.

559
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,000
他在掩藏情绪
He's burying his feelings.

560
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,760
也许他只是家教比较好
Or maybe he's just raised better than that.

561
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,840
他知道参与别人的战争是没有意义的
He knows it's pointless to fight other people's battles.

562
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,690
这是基因里带的  菲尔
It's all in the DNA, Phil.

563
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,460
我的老爹跟别人有矛盾的时候

564
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,240
相信我
Trust me

565
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,470
我就在操场上找那个家伙的孩子了
I'm looking for that guy's kid on the schoolyard.

566
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,710
这是男人的处事方式
It's how men work.

567
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,960
曾经的处事方式
Or used to work.

568
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,450
也许那些嗜血的普里契特基因
Maybe those thuggish Pritchett genes

569
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,230
混合了一些更先进的邓菲基因
got mixed with more evolved Dunphy genes,

570
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,210
塑造了一个有着更高尚情操的人类
resulting in a more elevated human being.

571
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,780
天哪  他在攻击他
Oh, my god! He's attacking him!

572
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,480
放开我的孩子
Hey! Hey! Get off my kid!

573
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,730
你才要放开我的孩子
Hey. Hey! Get off my kid!

574
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,860
是你要放开我的孩子
Aah! You get off of my kid!

575
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,950
放开我女儿的老公
Hey, hey! Get off my daughter's husband!

576
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,360
管我叫你的孩子会死吗  杰
Would it kill you to call me your kid, Jay?

577
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,470
天哪  原来他在救他
Oh, my god. He was saving him.

578
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,740
祝你有愉快的一天
Oh. Have a good day.

579
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,460
结果好  一切好
Well...all's well that ends well.

580
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,970
是啊  我们走吧
Yeah, yeah. Here we go.

581
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,800
坐一下  孩子
Grab a seat, son.

582
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,630
-走吧  -这就来
- Move. - Coming in.

583
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,070
我想  还是来个普通汉堡吧
I think, uh, probably just a regular burger.

584
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,480
我看不到它了  你觉得它走了吗
I can't see it anymore. You think it's gone?

585
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,690
可能藏起来了
It could be hiding.

586
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,360
我有个主意
I have an idea.

587
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,220
你要干什么
What are you doing?!

588
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,000
我准备分散它的注意力
I'm gonna create a distraction

589
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,610
这样我们可以趁机跑出去
so that we can make a break for it.

590
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,130
给点时间预热
Give it a second to warm up.

591
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,990
好的
Okay.

592
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,880
它回来了
It's back!

593
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,530
我的天哪
Oh, my gosh.

594
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,590
这下面太黑了
It's so dark down here.

595
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,940
小心点  宝贝
Be careful, sweetie.

596
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,560
这下面是怎么了
What is going on down here?!

597
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,310
好吧  我不得不承认
All right, I got to admit something right here.

598
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,030
今天你让我很受感动  卢克
You impressed me today, Luke.

599
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,840
那个孩子刚刚噎住了
That kid started choking.

600
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,920
你眼里看到的不是竞争对手
You didn't see a rival or...

601
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,780
或是一个为自己家族而战的机会
...a chance to fight your family's stupid battles.

602
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,890
你看到的是一个需要帮助的人
You just saw somebody who needed help.

603
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,940
这让你成为了这辆车上最成熟的人
And that makes you the biggest man in this whole car.

604
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,070
你刚刚就是想攻击他  对不对
You just attacked him, didn't you?

605
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,430
他表现得像噎住了
He made that choke sign.

606
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,060
我以为他在嘲笑我刚才的比赛
I thought he was mocking my wrestling.

607
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,530
-这事我们自己知道就可以了  -是的
- Let's go ahead and keep that to ourselves. - Yeah.

608
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,410
我来开吧
I'll get it.

609

It has a name

今天你孩子的所作所为太棒了
What your kid did today was amazing.

617
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,540
你不会记恨我的  对吧
No hard feelings, right?

618
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,400
小卡  手头上的事情先停一下
Hey, Cam, hold off on that thing for a second.

619
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,310
莉莉  亲爱的
Lily, honey?

620
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,870

Are you kidding me? It's all in good fun.

621
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,720

是我的侄女
Only my niece.

624
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,150
她最爱别人把她背在背上
If there's one thing she loves, it's piggy-back.

625
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,100
我没有啊
No, I don't.

626
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,040
