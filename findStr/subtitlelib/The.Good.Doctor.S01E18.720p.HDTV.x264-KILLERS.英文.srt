43
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,780
I want to be your friend again.

44
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,980
W-why, Shaun? What happened?

45
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,270
People need friends.

46
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,220
Well...

47
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,660
Yeah, they do.

48
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,580
But you said you wanted me -

49
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,730
to stop interfering, remember?

50
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,620
You wanted space.

51
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,740
You wanted - to make your own mistakes.

52
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,790
I need a friend more than I need space.

53
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,750
You were a good mentor and a good friend.

54
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,450
Well, thank you, Shaun.

55
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,690
You don't know how much it means to me to hear you say that.

56
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,330
But I-I think...

57
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,280
I think you may need a new mentor.

58
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm dying.

59
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,190
12 to 18 months.

60
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,500
I'd appreciate it - if you didn't tell anyone, okay?

61
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,830
I-I will in my own time.

62
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay. Have you had a full work-up?

63
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,850
Yes, of course.

64
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,220
It could be a secondary tumor

65
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,520
metastasized to your brain from somewhere else.

66
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,880
It's the only tumor found.

67
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,870
It could be an inflammatory or infectious process.

68
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,520
It was a tumor, Shaun.

69
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,870
You should get a second opinion.

70
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,970
Shaun, I've been a neurosurgeon for 30 years.

71
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,250
I think that qualifies as a second opinion.

72
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,870
You should get a second opinion.

73
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,520
You have to know whether --

74
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,470
All right, all right, all right, all right, Shaun.

75
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,860
I'll get a second opinion.

76
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,730
Okay?

77
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,170
Okay.

78
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,980
Can I go to work now?

79
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,670
Okay, Doctor, what's your diagnosis?

80
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm drunk.

81
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,950
Not you. Other doctor.

82
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,000
Uh, well, given the degree of the rotation

83
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,220
and the fact that the break is almost compound,

84
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,870
I'd say we're dealing with a Bimalleolar

85
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,050
or Trimalleolar fracture.

86
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,760
Very good. What else?

87
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,240
Color?

88
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,180
Blood flow is restricted.

89
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,270
His foot's dying.

90
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,960
Oh, no.

91
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,440
I'm gonna have to reset it now. Hold his leg.

92
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,190
- No.No, no, no. - No, it's okay.

93
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,140
It's just gonna take a second.

94
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,420
I need you to count to three.

95
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,550
One...

96
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,830
One, two --

97
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,130
Is Caden's leg gonna be okay?

98
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,080
How long has his leg been like this

99
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,500
and how exactly did it happen?

100
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,060
Well, he's been like that since I found him.

101
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,430
He probably tripped over a curb or something

102
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,490
because that's where he was.

103
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,630
Any reason you felt the need to tell me twice

104
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,770
that you found him like this?

105
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,970
Dr. Park, boy's going to surgery.

106
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,970
You're going with.

107
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,990
Don't go anywhere.

108
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,580
Shouldn't I be asleep for this?

109
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,790
Your blood alcohol level complicates anesthesia

110
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,580
and we think you have a concussion,

111
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,820
so we're gonna keep you responsive.

112
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,430
We did give you a regional nerve block,

113
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,270
so you shouldn't feel anything.

114
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,840
Cool.

115
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,000
Bend the LCP plate over two degrees on the proximal end.

116
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,270
Contouring pliers.

117
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,910
BP is dropping, heart rate's rising.

118
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,390
Let's tube him. IV fluids and phenylephrine, stat.

119
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,470
We need to abort until we can get a handle on what else is going on.

120
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,310
Give me a full body CT, full blood panels, and an echo.

121
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,610
I think Jared and I may be able to dig up an answer quicker.

122
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,040
Great. Get on it.

123
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,870
Come up with anything?

124
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,860
Neither did I.

125
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,140
I had a friend, a neurosurgeon, at SF Muni.

126
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,880
She looked at the scans.

127
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,710
She came to the same diagnosis, Shaun.

128
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,570
I have an inoperable glioma.

129
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,880
Okay?

130
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,340
I think you should go back to work, yes?

131
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,070
I need to go to work.

132
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,490
Be reasonable.

133
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,560
Beg your pardon?

134
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,210
Be reasonable.

135
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,970
I have no idea what you're talking about.

136
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,200
Oh, it'll be clear.

137
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,580
What the hell happened to Caden?

138
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,050
I -- I don't know. He twisted his ankle. I --

139
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,310
You lied to me before.

140
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,650
You're lying to me now, you spoiled little coward.

141
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,580
Be reasonable.

142
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,200
His friend's hurt.

143
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,820
He's scared, and you're freaking him out.

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,890
He's angry, but he's not wrong.

145
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,620
Caden's in bad shape, and we don't know why.

146
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,950
We need to know what happened.

147
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,640
No, no, don't -- don't worry about him.

148
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,690
Talk to me.

149
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,000
You tell me the truth.

150
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,170
You won't get in trouble. You'll just...help a friend.

151
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,600
All right.

152
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,720
We were pledging.

153
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,540
And there's -- there's this, uh, wheel of torture thing

154
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,370
you got to do for initiation.

155
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,480
- Torture? - But it's mos-- - it's mostly stupid stuff, dude.

156
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,870
It's, like, like, drink a cup of olive oil

157
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,430
or eat a tablespoon of cinnamon.

158
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,770
And what did Caden land on?

159
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,740
Laundry.

160
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,250
He had to do laundry?

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,630
No, like, like, he had to, uh, eat th-those laundry things,

162
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,310
as many as he could in 30 seconds.

163
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,330
Detergent? Eat detergent?

164
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,640
And how many did he have?

165
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,790
I don't know. Like six, maybe seven, seven.

166
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,860
He ate detergent.

167
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,980
Could've burned a hole through his esophagus

168
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,120
or his stomach and intestines.

169
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,620
Catch that bleeder, please.

170
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,250
Let's hope he doesn't breed.

171
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,730
What? He isn't an idiot?

172
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,910
We have healthy bowel attached to healthy bowel.

173
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,720
Let's close him up.

174
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,830
Dr. Melendez?

175
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,290
The trauma S.O.D. is asking for you in O.R. Number 2.

176
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,020
We got an emergency thoracotomy.

177
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,850
Who can give me - the remaining steps for closing?

178
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,230
Cut anchoring sutures, clear laps,

179
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,180
and reposition the bowel.

180
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,950
Remove clamps from the duodenal resection site,

181
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,550
keeping clear of the underlying aorta,

182
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,560
close the fascia using a looped 0 monofilament,

183
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,790
close the dermal layer, then reapproximate the skin.

184
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,990
Also, you need to ensure no omentum is caught

185
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,790
in the fascial suture line.

186
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,580
Close him up.

187
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,710
Murphy, you're lead.

188
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,590
Clearing laps.

189
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,780
I will hold the repaired segment in place

190
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,500
while you run the bowel for me.

191
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,840
Bowel is clear - and ready to be repositioned.

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,490
Shaun?

193
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,700
Shaun, is everything all right?

194
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,830
I lost something.

195
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,950
In the cavity?

196
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,190
No.

197
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,230
But I know where it is now.

198
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,540
Shaun.

199
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,800
I left my scalpel here earlier today.

200
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,160
You should get Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

201
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,300
A DTI?

202
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,810
Masses are difficult to diagnose accurately.

203
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,410
You should get more imaging.

204
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,010
People make mistakes.

205
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,450
That's not gonna happen, Shaun.

206
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,500
My scalpel isn't here.

207
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,170
What happened this time?

208
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,440
He's got a bleed somewhere.

209
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,050
I want a capsule endoscopy to check

210
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,000
the entire length of the bowel for bleeding and leaks.

211
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,320
And get me a complete coagulation and metabolic profile.

212
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,190
On it.

213
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,680
Dr. Glassman is dying.

214
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,410
What?

215
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,290
What do you mean? He seemed fine.

216
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,060
They say he has a glioma.

217
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,390
That's a brain tumor.

218
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,760
And he won't do a DTI scan to confirm the diagnosis.

219
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,910
Did he get a second opinion?

220
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,730
He has, but delayed or missed

221
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,530
or incorrect diagnosis

222
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,130
has an occurrence rate of 10% to 20%.

223
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,820
Doctors make mistakes.

224
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,370
Shaun, I don't know what you want me to do.

225
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,270
I-I want you to sit down.

226
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,470
That's what people say

227
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,300
when they want to tell you something important.

228
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,170
The part about him dying,

229
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,400
that wasn't the important part?

230
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,300
He won't listen to me.

231
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,130
He is stubborn.

232
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,490
- That he is. - Stubborn.

233
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,890
He will listen to you.

234
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,870
Okay, you have known him longer,

235
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,950
you're his friend, he trusts you.

236
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,270
Shaun, I can't make him do anything, either.

237
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,530
You -- Y-You're an attorney.

238
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,420
I'm not skilled - at lying or manipulation.

239
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,550
So you want me to what?

240
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,630
You want me to manipulate him?

241
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,860
You want me to use our relationship and our history -

242
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,170
to trick him into doing this?

243
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,960
Yes, please.

244
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,590
I knew you wouldn't let him die.

245
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,980
Our patient has Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.

246
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,000
Can anyone tell me why that is very bad?

247
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,090
Blood clots form throughout the blood vessels

248
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,170
and rapidly deplete the body's clotting factors,

249
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,810
thereby causing a systematic bleed.

250
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,430
It's also a catch-22.

251
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,830
If we treat the clotting,

252
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,410
he might end up with a terminal bleed.

253
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,570
And if we treat the bleeding, he'll have a terminal clot.

254
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,830
So how do we treat it?

255
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,900
We figure out the cause. Treat the cause.

256
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,430
More damage from the detergent?

257
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,680
Margins were clear. It's not that.

258
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,270
He could have a crush injury from his ankle.

259
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,940
Or a bacterial infection he picked up before or during surgery.

260
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,580
It might have been set off by drug use.

261
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,010
Or we did this to him.

262
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,060
And by "We," I mean Shaun.

263
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,320
He spaced out in the O.R. when he was closing,

264
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,660
kind of like he is now.

265
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,840
- I'm listening. - Comforting.

266
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,910
He wasn't focused.

267
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,230
He could've nicked a vessel, which could've caused --

268
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,730
Okay, we're talking about Shaun.

269
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,780
Yeah, he's quiet, but he was focused.

270
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,950
He's always focused.

271
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,560
His stitches look like they came out of a sewing machine.

272
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,910
All right. Complications happen.

273
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,820
The kid was in pretty bad shape when we got him.

274
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,050
Physician error is way down on the list of likely causes.

275
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,270
Crush trauma being top.

276
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,650
Get him started on fresh frozen plasma and crystalloid fluids.

277
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,960
Yeah?

278
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,380
You got a second?

279
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,910
Well, that's an open question.

280
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,550
What can I do for you?

281
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,410
I got a patient with DIC.

282
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,130
One of the possible causes is surgeon error.

283
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,590
Your patient, your error?

284
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,630
Shaun's.

285
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,740
He got distracted - during surgery, spaced out.

286
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,420
It's not like him.

287
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,880
One place he never misses a beat is the O.R.

288
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,830
Is there anything going on that I should know about?

289
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,790
He got some bad news.

290
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,040
About what?

291
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,010
It's a personal matter.

292
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,940
Shaun was distracted by a personal issue?

293
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,020
What, did Lea come back?

294
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,050
She have a new boyfriend?

295
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,330
His cable get cut off?

296
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,960
I have an inoperable glioma.

297
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,730
18 months.

298
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
Aaron, I am so sorry.

299
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,160
Me, too.

300
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,790
Is there anything I can do?

301
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,500
I wish.

302
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,930
You should've told me.

303
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,230
Or at least you shouldn't have told him.

304
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,280
His coagulation factors are still off.

305
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,810
Crush trauma isn't the issue.

306
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,380
And his tox screen came back clean.

307
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,230
- It's not drugs, either. - We don't know that.

308
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,840
He's had so many transfusions,

309
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,410
the blood in his veins isn't the same blood he came in with.

310
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,990
The drugs could still be in his organs causing --

311
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,200
I get that you don't want to think

312
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,500
that this could be caused by your friend, but we have to --

313
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,180
The kid came directly from a frat hazing, hammered.

314
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,940
What are the odds he wasn't on drugs?

315
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,920
We should start IV midazolam

316
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,080
and sodium bicarbonate to counteract --

317
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,770
That's the treatment for amphetamines.

318
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,640
If you're wrong,

319
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,340
that could cause a fatal arrhythmia.

320
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,910
I'll find out what drugs he's on.

321
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,520
You're going to find out by asking?

322
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,050
Blake was honest with me before.

323
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,070
It's a lot easier to be honest

324
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,600
when you're not confessing to a crime.

325
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,390
We don't have a lot of choice in the matter.

326
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,000
That's not true.

327
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:23,910
Thanks for doing this.

328
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,040
Yeah, no worries.

329
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,440
Noticed it was cut when I first saw you.

330
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,940
Figured it should get cleaned up.

331
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,150
Is it all right if I draw some blood?

332
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:35,920
Just want to make sure

333
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,730
you don't have any toxins or infections.

334
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,540
Sure.

335
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,370
So,

336
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,910
the nurse said that Caden has DIC.

337
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,200
Do you know what that is?

338
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,490
Well, in short, his body is clotting

339
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,990
and hemorrhaging at the same time.

340
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,130
If we can't figure out what's causing it,

341
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,050
he'll die.

342
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,080
Just hold that there for me.

343
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,190
All done.

344
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,490
Blake, buddy, you're on something.

345
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,320
Your pupils are dilated,

346
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,620
and you're sweating in a 68-degree room.

347
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,990
Now, I can hand this over to the cops

348
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,940
or you can tell the truth about what Caden's on.

349
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:21,970
Molly.

350
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,600
I would've told you the truth if you'd asked.

351
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,440
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,930
You have time to talk?

353
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,190
Shaun told you.

354
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,590
He did. Yeah.

355
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,440
I wish I would've heard it from you.

356
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,040
Yeah, I'm sorry.

357
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,440
- We're friends. - I get it.

358
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,420
- I want to be there for you. - What, are you mad at me?

359
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,340
Yes.

360
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,330
I'm supposed to be there for you.

361
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,320
To do what? To do what exactly? Hold my hand?

362
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,970
Yes, if that's what's needed.

363
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,690
Okay, well, what I need is to be left alone, okay?

364
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,740
Well, you told Shaun,

365
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,780
so that was a brilliant strategy.

366
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,090
Okay, okay, I get it.

367
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,280
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, okay?

368
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,340
Sometimes when people are told they are dying,

369
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,500
they do stupid things!

370
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,730
Sometimes people around them do stupid things!

371
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,180
Shaun told you to come here

372
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,610
to try to convince me to get more imaging, right?!

373
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,610
Aaron, you can't stop fighting.

374
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,130
- Maddie wouldn't have wanted you to stop -- - Don't,

375
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,110
don't, don't, don't you dare.

376
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,160
Don't you dare.

377
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,140
What are you gonna say, huh?

378
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,070
That Maddie was a fighter?

379
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,760
That she never quit?

380
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm sorry.

381
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,520
Thank you.

382
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,740
And you should get the DTI.

383
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:04,850
Not for you.

384
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,490
You've accepted your diagnosis.

385
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,510
Shaun hasn't.

386
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,950
He needs to.

387
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,590
Hey, Neil.

388
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,530
I heard there was a complication in one of your cases.

389
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,750
Caden Hauley?

390
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,970
Heard or have you been monitoring all of Murphy's cases?

391
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,070
I monitor all my department's cases.

392
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,930
18-year-old with DIC.

393
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,300
Any idea what set it off?

394
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,630
Complications happen.

395
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,690
The kid was in pretty bad shape when he got to us.

396
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,310
I'm also wondering why you were in two surgeries at once.

397
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,950
You left three first-years unattended?

398
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,240
You know we do this all the time.

399
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,280
We couldn't function efficiently if we didn't.

400
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,130
I hope Caden pulls through.

401
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,670
You got a very quick appointment.

402
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,680
I have connections, Shaun.

403
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,450
Why did you listen to Jessica but not me?

404
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,590
Well, Jessica's pretty smart, too.

405
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,240
Yes, but what did she tell you?

406
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,680
I don't think this is a good time.

407
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,940
When is a good time?

408
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,660
I have a lot to learn from you,

409
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,630
and if you're dying, less than two years to learn.

410
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,010
Sorry to keep you waiting.

411
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,140
There were some surprises on your images.

412
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,180
The previous diagnosis was incorrect.

413
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,500
You have a Glioblastoma Multiforme located in your pons.

414
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,810
I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,

415
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,480
but it's the most aggressive form of brain cancer.

416
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,500
We estimate three, maybe four months.

417
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,460
I can have my assistant get in touch with you

418
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,020
to refer you to a therapist when you're ready.

419
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,500
He still has low blood pressure and thin blood,

420
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,690
which means the treatment for the MDMA didn't work.

421
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,260
So the Molly wasn't the problem?

422
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,210
It certainly didn't help him, but now we think he --

423
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,260
Our best guess is Caden has a bacterial infection.

424
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,960
Thanks.

425
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,990
DIC?

426
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,580
What happened there?

427
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,840
Uh, we're not sure yet.

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,510
He was pretty sick when he came in.

429
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,980
I guess sometimes complications just happen.

430
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,580
Interesting choice of words.

431
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,790
Eerily similar - to what Dr. Melendez said to me.

432
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,780
Yeah, he said it during a differential.

433
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,680
I guess the phrasing just stuck with me.

434
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,790
It's not like Melendez to be that laissez-faire.

435
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,000
He usually likes to know exactly why things happen.

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,610
One of the traits I admire about him.

437
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,560
Yeah, well, we're trying to figure it out.

438
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,030
But so far, - the cultures are negative.

439
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,820
Shaun's closing was textbook.

440
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,720
Drug use doesn't seem to be a problem.

441
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,400
I didn't realize Murphy did the closing.

442
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,120
Good for him.

443
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,150
Oh, my God.

444
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,080
Shaun.

445
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,230
Yes, yes, there are - many different explanations.

446
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,200
You asked me to get a second opinion. I got a second opinion.

447
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,710
You asked me to get more imaging. I got more imaging.

448
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,160
Shaun, you have to accept --

449
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,990
No, I don't accept.

450
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,040
I don't accept. I was right.

451
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,220
No, you were not right. I'm dying, Shaun.

452
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,790
I said doctors make mistakes...

453
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,510
- Yeah, they made a mistake. - and they made a mistake.

454
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,050
{\an8}I have less time than we even thought!

455
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,430
Shaun was right. Shaun was right.

456
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,410
Imaging is unreliable.

457
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,590
The imaging that you asked me to get.

458
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,970
Imaging is subject to interpretation.

459
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,900
Yes, studies have shown that experts rely on --

460
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,230
on -- on subjective measures

461
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,070
- based on experience rather than object - No more.

462
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,490
- Rather than objective - No more, no.

463
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,930
No. No, no. No more. No more.

464
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,120
- No more. - Many theories consistent with --

465
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,310
You can do a biopsy to confirm

466
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,740
because many tumors look alike.

467
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,230
Some are treatable.

468
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,950
- Some are curable. - Stop, will ya?!

469
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,200
Some are curable. They're curable.

470
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,880
Stop, please, will ya?! Stop, stop, stop talking!

471
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
- Stop! - Okay.

472
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,590
Stop!

473
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,010
I am not hurting you.

474
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,580
Oh, my God, stop.

475
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,360
I'm helping you.

476
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,320
No, you're not. You're not helping.

477
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,490
I don't need theories.

478
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,940
I don't need white boards.

479
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,750
I don't need doctors!

480
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,820
I don't want to think about the tumor!

481
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,120
I don't want to think about dying!

482
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,490
You know what I want?

483
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,550
You know what I actually want? I want to -- I want to --

484
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,570
I want to go - on a long drive somewhere.

485
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,170
I want to -- I want to eat pancakes.

486
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,510
I want to watch football.

487
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,050
- It's not football season. - Oh, my God.

488
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,910
I know - it's not football season.

489
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,100
Do you mean you want to have fun?

490
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,820
Yeah.

491
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,400
I want to have fun.

492
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,480
So you can keep fighting.

493
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,330
Keep fighting if you want.

494
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,810
It's futile and it's stupid.

495
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,240
Or you can come with me.

496
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,490
How long has he been hypoxic?

497
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,000
It came on suddenly five minutes ago.

498
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,510
He's on 100% high-flow oxygen, and his numbers aren't budging.

499
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,340
He's ventilating fine.

500
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,000
He must have thrombosed his pulmonary artery.

501
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,840
We need to dissolve this clot before his heart stops.

502
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,270
- Jared, prep for jugular access. - On it.

503
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,460
50 milligrams tPA. Infusion now.

505
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,110
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

506
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,580
Is this fun?

507
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,240
The Saturday after Valentine's Day,

508
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,500
her favorite day of the year,

509
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,280
even more than her birthday.

510
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,000
The Chamber of Commerce would decorate this place

511
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,950
and put out a crappy buffet meal, hire a deejay,

512
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,360
and I'd put on a tux,

513
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,330
and she'd put on a yellow Belle dress,

514
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,080
and she'd...

515
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,690
pin my bow tie on me,

516
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,680
and I'd pin a little yellow corsage on her.

517
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,790
And we'd come and we'd eat and we'd -- and we'd dance.

518
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:15,000

Oh, you think so, huh?

526
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,460
Well, I'll tell you what.

527
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,970
You can take how much you love me,

528

which I know is quite a lot,

529
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,590

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,950
that I know will be in my mind

538
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,360
when I -- when I -- when I close my eyes to die."

539
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,290
Only I thought - that she'd be sitting there, right next to me,

540
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,530
and I'd hear her say it one more time.

541
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,000
I lost my toy scalpel.

542
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,870
The one that Steve gave me.

543
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,700
Yeah, I figured that was the one.

544
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,540
I have been looking for a whole day.

545
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,710
I think it may be gone forever.

546
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,630
Maybe I'll come here when you're dead.

547
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Okay.

548
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,340
Are your memories - of your daughter enough for you?

549
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,560
Not even close.

550
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,410
Do you need me to listen to you anymore?

551
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,780
No, Shaun, you should go.

552
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,800
Okay.

553
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,900
Not all the cultures are back.

554
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,970
But since he's not responding to any antibiotics,

555
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,020
we can rule out bacterial.

556
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,660
It was never a great fit.

557
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,330
It's a better fit than surgical error.

558
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,730
What if it is bacterial but resistant to all --

559
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,440
Then he's dead.

560
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,310
What about Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria?

561
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,030
Pnh? The incidence - is literally one in a million.

562
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,980
What's the odds of Murphy screwing up?

563
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,840
I'd put them about that.

564
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,390
No, it's not PNH.

565
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,010
Caden had normal flow cytometry.

566
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,410
Exotic snake venom can trigger consumptive coagulopathies.

567
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,630
So can pre-eclampsia,

568
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:59,140
but he's not pregnant and he wasn't charming snakes.

569
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,330
Murphy, any thoughts here?

570
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,260
It is kind of your ass on the line.

571
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,050
I know why Caden has DIC.

572
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,980
I squeezed the artery between two clamps.

573
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,260
I must have ruptured the aortic wall,

574
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,340
causing a pseudo-aneurysm.

575
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,150
It was my mistake.

576
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,420
And also...

577
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,550
I have to make a bowel movement.

578
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,530
He's lying.

579
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,630
He's gonna puke.

580
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,850
He's going to Glassman.

581
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,540
I told Dr. Melendez I had to make a bowel movement.

582
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,030
I think he believed me.

583
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,670
Color me proud.

584
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,990
I have the answer.

585
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,100
Shaun, I hope you're referring to your patient,

586
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,420
but due to the fact that you're here,

587
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,650
pretending to be in the bathroom,

588
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,910
- I kind of doubt that. - Yes, it's your answer.

589
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,970
We already --

590
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,800
We already have my answer, Shaun.

591
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,760
We can't do a biopsy on you

592
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,700
because of the arteries in the way,

593
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,300
like the arteries in Caden's abdomen,

594
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,630
but we can't move the arteries in your brain because --

595
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,990
Why did we go to the carousel?

596
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,930
Because you were sad.

597
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,670
What didn't I want to do?

598
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,360
Do you not know the answers to these questions?

599
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,760
I do know the answers, Shaun.

600
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,660
I don't think you know the answers to these questions.

601
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,050
You're not hearing me. I'm dying.

602
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,380
There's still hope.

603
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,440
Shaun, look at me.

604
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,180
Look at me, please.

605
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,310
There is no hope for me.

606
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,020
I mean, hope?

607
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,030
What -- What -- What -- What is hope?

608
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,260
You hope the 49ers find a defense.

609
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,910
You hope the number 4 bus comes on time.

610
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,060
Doesn't mean they magically learn how to tackle.

611
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,210
Doesn't mean the bus driver suddenly drives faster.

612
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,320
Hope is irrelevant for me.

613
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,950
Hope is painful.

614
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,200
I don't want to spend what's left of my life

615
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,310
chasing my tail around in a circle.

616
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,180
You understand?

617
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,880
Okay.

618
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,160
Okay.

619
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,990
Your tumor is located at the base of your skull.

620
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,120
An open cranial biopsy would tell us what's wrong.

621
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,500
But there are blood vessels in the way.

622
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,910
The biopsy would cause an aneurysm or a bleed.

623
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,540
But if we go through your nasal cribriform plate,

624
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,020
we can cross the tentorium on the contralateral side

625
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,370
and avoid all those blood vessels.

626
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:38,880
We can do a biopsy through your nose.

627
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,800
You can't die, too.

628
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,000
I have to throw up.

629
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,140
So how do we do this? Do we file a report?

630
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,370
Talk to Andrews personally?

631
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,810
You want to report Shaun?

632
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,680
I don't want to. I think we have to.

633
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,840
No, you want to.

634
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,300
And we'd certainly have to if our sole agenda

635
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,500
would be to take down Shaun

636
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,440
and to give you one less person to compete against.

637
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,180
And certainly, we'd absolutely "Have to"

638
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,340
cover up and bury a possible fatal medical error

639
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,610
if our sole agenda was to protect a friend?

640
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,900
Protocol would seem to favor the bitch over the friend.

641
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,130
Thanks?

642
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,830
I threw up.

643
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,930
We have a duty to report errors

644
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,460
so they won't happen again.

645
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:42,610
The process saves lives.

646
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:45,130
And exactly what errors are we trying to avoid a repeat of?

647
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,850
You worried about the next time an autistic surgeon operates

648
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,700
on a drugged-up frat kid after finding out his mentor

649
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,220
is dying of brain cancer?

650
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,250
Dr. Melendez told us, Shaun.

651
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,670
We're really sorry.

652
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,680
It's okay.

653
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,170
It's okay.

654
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,710
I think he's going to be okay.

655
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,620
The protocol exists

656
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,450
so that we don't ask questions like that.

657
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,210
That seems like a bad idea.

658
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,720
You trust your judgment.

659
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,180
Do you trust Morgan's judgment?

660
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,500
Do you trust the judgment of all the doctors in this building?

661
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,600
If you can make judgment calls, so can they.

662
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,140
That's why we need these rules.

663
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,240
No, the protocol is fine for everyone in this building,

664
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,540
except for Shaun.

665
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,610
They'd reprimand any one of us, but they will fire him.

666
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,160
Okay.

667
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,980
We report it.

668
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,010
We get the investigation,

669
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,940
make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

670
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,920
But we tell them I did it.

671
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,330
They'd fire you, too.

672
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,180
It's not a terrible idea.

673
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,520
Jared's out the door either way.

674
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,320
Can we get back to the medicine?

675
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,890
Caden is still alive.

676
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,140
If we can keep it that way,

677
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,730
there won't be any review.

678
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,410
Which means no one will be asking questions,

679
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,850
and no one will have to give answers.

680
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,090
It all goes away.

681
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,350
If Caden dies, we tell the truth

682
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,620
and we face the consequences together.

683
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,700
No.

684
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,150
No.

685
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:09,020
I thought I'd found my toy scalpel.

686
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,170
We need you to come back to the group, Murphy.

687
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,680
Get me imaging on that pseudo-aneurysm.

688
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,330
What's up?

689
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,450
Do you still feel - the same way about Dr. Murphy

690
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,490
as when he got here?

691
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:43,270
Dr. Glassman gave us certain...assurances.

692
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,740
"If Shaun proves - anything less than excellent,

693
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,900
if Shaun doesn't live up to everything I know he can do,

694
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,220
he will be immediately released,

695
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,100
and I will resign my position

696
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,110
as president of the hospital."

697
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,750
And you wrote it down.

698
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,530
I made sure it was in the minutes.

699
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,480
Shaun has exceeded my expectations.

700
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,310
Mine, as well, and?

701
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,680
And my feelings about Dr. Glassman have not changed.

702
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,830
Thank you.

703
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,440
We need to cut him open.

704
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,950
We cut him open and he dies.

705
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,630
He'll bleed out before we can even get the artery exposed.

706
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,590
If we don't cut him open, he dies.

707
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,990
Don't cut him open.

708
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,990
Murphy, if we don't --

709
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,430
We should insert an endovascular graft

710
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,460
through his leg instead.

711
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,870
Fix it from the inside out.

712
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,050
I've done that for large abdominal aorta dilations,

713
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,880
but this is a lengthy dissecting pseudo-aneurysm.

714
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,000
It's safer.

715
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,560
The aortic wall is already compromised.

716
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,900
Could rupture completely.

717
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,840
Caden could die as soon as we deflate the balloon inside the graft.

718
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,370
But doing nothing will kill him.

719
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,560
Not definitely.

720
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,150
There's still a chance Caden will simply come out of this

721
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,570
without any surgical intervention.

722
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,620
5%, 10% maybe.

723
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,430
Not nothing.

724
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,540
And we're doubling down on Shaun

725
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,250
after we know he caused this problem.

726
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,950
How's that gonna look at an M&M?

727
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,610
I trust Shaun's idea.

728
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,950
He makes mistakes no one else would make,

729
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,730
but he also makes saves none of us would have ever thought of.

730
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,450
Thank you.

731
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,480
You're welcome.

732
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,760
I still don't think you should be working here.

733
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,610
I don't think the trade-off is worth it.

734
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,130
Well, let's prep him for surgery.

735
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,690
Pull the guide wire, Reznick.

736
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,560
I'm passing in the graft.

737
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,970
You're right over the pseudo-aneurysm now.

738
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,520
Inflating the balloon to deploy the graft.

739
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,910
Deflating.

740
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,260
Can I do it?

741
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,350
It's delicate.

742
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:13,300
No, it's not.

743
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:18,410
And it will either work or it won't work.

744
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,790
If my idea is wrong,

745
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,520
he'll die as soon - as we complete this next step.

746
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,950
You shouldn't have to live with that.

747
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Everything that happens in this room is my responsibility.

748
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,870
We'll do it together.

749
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,850
Deflating.

750
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,180
Nobody's going home.

751
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,140
I am proud of this team and what we accomplished today.

752
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,540
Drinks are on me at Harry Hopes.

753
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,010
We're celebrating?

754
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,770
Today was a disaster, and we got lucky.

755
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,170
You're right.

756
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,810
But when you get lucky, you celebrate.

757
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,220
Let's go.

758
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,730
At some point in your career,

759
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,340
you're going to kill someone.

760
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,370
And I hope for your sake there's a doctor out there

761
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,140
who still believes in you when you do.

762
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,650
It was there all along.

763
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,420
I have to go drinking, but I wanted you to know --

764
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,950
Is that from an IV?

765
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,280
You did the biopsy.

766
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,200
I did.

767
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,250
I have a low-grade glioma.

768
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,180
Not a GBM?

769
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:50,010
I told you --

770
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,960
Cancer, Shaun. It's still cancer.

771
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,610
I have to undergo brain surgery,

772
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,450
which is really scary because I'm not the one performing it.

773
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,080
Five days a week - for six weeks of radiation,

774
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,780
10 more weeks of chemotherapy.

775
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,360
And then?

776
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,990
And then...

777
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,350
with a little luck...

778
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:15,140
you and I can go to the Super Bowl next season.

779
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,010
You're going to live.

780
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,240
There's hope.

781
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,360
Now go. Go have some fun with your friends.

782
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,620
Yes. First I have to tell Dr. Andrews about the mistake I made.

783
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,000
Shaun, y-you can't.

784
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,740
Protocol is clear, and reporting saves lives.

785
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,370
And I hear Caden is on the road to recovery,

786
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,490
so your mistake couldn't have been too bad.

787
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,890
No, I made a mistake.

788
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,450
Shaun, I understand that.

789
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,540
But Dr. Andrews will use this.

790
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,970
And do you remember the commitment

791
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,200
that Dr. Glassman made when you were hired?

792
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,670
I promised you'd be excellent, right, Shaun?

793
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,630
And you have been excellent.

794
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,120
You can't give Dr. Andrews this excuse.

795
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,580
I was not excellent.

796
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,000
This time, I was bad.

797
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,100
And surgeons have to be excellent every time.

798
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,340
Right, Shaun?

799
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,170
You agree with him?

800
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,340
I'm not gonna ask him to lie to save my job.

801
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,480
Don't do this.

802
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,610
It's up to Shaun.

803
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,850
I trust your judgment.

804
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,350
I'm not doing this to hurt you.

805
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:49,830
I know.

806
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,180
We are friends.

807
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,560
Yes, we are.

808
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,000
I love you.

809
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,670
I know. I love you, too.

810
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,350
I love you more.
