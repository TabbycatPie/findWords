很多人都会弄这个打扮

123
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,120
我觉得没事  参加卢克派对的人
I think you're good. Nobody going to Luke's party

124

所以我要去参加另一场派对
Yeah, that's why I'm going to a different party.

126
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,640
你不能为了去别人的派对而不去卢克的派对
You're not skipping Luke's party to go to someone else's.

曼尼  这是因为卢克战胜了你  
Manny, is this because Luke beat you 

130
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,050
成为了学生会主席吗
for class president?

131
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,720
你为什么忘不掉这惨绝人寰的羞辱呢
Why can't you get over this devastating humiliation?

132
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,140
因为总有人事物让我一直想起
Because something keeps me reminding me.

133
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,570
但这跟那件事无关
But it has nothing to do with that.

不不
No, no, no, no, no.

140
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,480
你扮成了耶稣的样子  就别说"杂种"了
Don't say the word "Bastard" when you're dressed like Jesus!

141
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,480

149
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,350

但你必须往他鞋子里放死鱼

153
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,970
做为交换  如果你妈起疑心  我会替你掩护
And I'm gonna cover for you if your mother gets suspicious.

154
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,090
我怎么把鱼夹带进去啊
Where am I going to hide fish?

155
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,350
你在浴缸里哎
You're in a bathtub!

156
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,940

我就不能拿把刀自己去吗

What? It's my one and only candy bar for the night.

166
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,640
我不会再吃士力架了
No more Snickers.

167
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,960
如果你不想被人笑[听到士力架]
If you don't want to hear any more snickers

168
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,060
那就不要假装那是你最后一根
then don't pretend that's your last candy bar.

169
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,790
小卡吃了糖以后反应很大
Cam doesn't react well to candy.

170
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,810
所以我从来不吃  除了万圣节
Which is why I never eat it. Except on Halloween.

171
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,450
我承认  过去我太放纵自己了
And I admit, in years past, I may have overindulged.

172
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,050
他每次吃糖吃到嗨到山顶
Which leads to a crazy high

173
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,180
过后就会飙泪自我厌恶到谷底
followed by a tearful, self-loathing crash.

174
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,710
简直就是《醉乡情断》的翻版
It's a Days of Red Vines and Roses.

175
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,850
{\an8}美国1966年电影  讲述从小酌变成酗酒  
最后幸福家庭被击垮的故事

176
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,550
不给糖就捣蛋
Trick or treat!

177
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,600
拿一颗吧
Yep, just take one.

178
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,300
我记得那个笑声  今年休想得逞
I know that laugh. Not this year.

179
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,080
放手
Drop it.

180
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,370
你疯了
You're crazy.

181
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,750
对  为正义疯狂
Yeah, crazy for justice!

182
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,100
你穿得像个恶棍
And just because you're dressed like a villain

183
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,560
不见得就要表现得像个恶棍
doesn't mean you have to act like one!

184
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,620
天啊  你敢相信吗
Oh, my God. Can you believe that?

185
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,550
对啊  一个九岁的孩子
Yes, a 9-year-old kid

186
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,050
想在万圣节多拿几颗糖
wanting extra candy on Halloween.

187
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,200
真是太"莫名其妙"了
Oh, it is baffling.

188
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,370
说到九岁孩子在万圣节要糖...
Speaking of 9-year-olds wanting candy on Halloween...

189
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,220
等等  亲爱的
Okay, just a second, honey.

190
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,780
小卡  抓住一个孩子的胳膊
Cam, maybe grabbing a kid's arm

191
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,320
真的不应该啊...
is where we draw the line.

192
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
我好像在每一本法律书上都读过
I think I read that in every single law book.

193
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,740
这话听着像是
This sounds like something

194
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,290
我们可以在人行道上边走边聊的内容
we could be talking about on the sidewalk.

195
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,780
稍等亲爱的  你知道吗  米奇尔
Okay, just a second, honey. You know what, Mitchell?

196
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,010
就是那个小混蛋每年都拿一大把糖走
That same little jerk grabs a handful of candy every year.

197
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,850
他是我的万圣节死敌
He's my Halloween nemesis.

198
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,760
这是一条社会契约
There is a social contract.

199
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,700
说一句"不给糖就捣蛋"  只能拿一颗糖
You say "Trick or treat," you get one piece of candy.

200
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,350
这契约一但瓦解  我们就离没有法制
That breaks down, we're just a hop, skip, and a jump

201
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,250
以破珠子和牙齿当钱的原始社会不远了
to a lawless wasteland where we use beads and teeth for money!

202
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,990
你刚才说才吃第一根巧克力棒对吧
That was your first candy bar, you say?

203
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,370
你也许应该摄入点蛋白质
You think maybe you should have a little protein

204
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,290
来平衡一下糖分
to balance that out?

205
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,080
我不需要蛋白质
I don't need any protein.

206
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,350
可是老天爷好像想你补充"蛋白质"呢
I feel like the universe is telling you differently.

207
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,430
是谁干的
Who did that?!

208
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,610
他朝那边跑了  经过了所有发糖的房子
He went that way! Past all the houses handing out candy!

209
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,550
交给我吧
I'm on it!

210
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,540
不  你看  他叫乔
No, see, his name is Joe.

211
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,110
对  可不都是小孩扮耶稣吗
Yeah, but wouldn't the child be Jesus?

212
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,270
这个电话我得接
I got to take this.

213
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,860
跟她解释我们这是在干嘛
Tell her what we're doing with this.

214
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,250
我老公要下地狱了
My husband is going to hell

215
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,970
他想拖着我们所有人一起
and he's trying to take us with him.

216
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,200
你好
Hello?

217
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,680
好吧  我到厄尔的卧室了
Okay, I'm in Earl's bedroom.

218
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,070
你想看我展示他的鞋吗
Do you want me to show you his shoes

219
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,860
这样你就能选让我塞鱼进哪一双
so you can pick which ones I shove fish into?

220
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,320
追随你的内心  孩子  等等  那是什么
Follow your heart, kid. Wait a minute. What's that?

221
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,920
什么
What?

222
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,400
你身后墙上那幅画
That picture on the wall behind you.

223
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
那是什么  我看看
What is that? Let me see it.

224
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,300
大卫·索尔在《警界双雄》里饰演哈奇
David Soul played Hutch in "Starsky and Hutch."

225
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,300
{\an8}1975年电视剧

226
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,720
我的其中一个绝妙橱柜哏
Now, one of my groovier closet ideas

227
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,450
是个为你把滑雪板
was a hutch for your skis

228
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,610
锁在衣柜里处的架子
that latched onto the end of your closet.

229
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,680
我称之为柜"索"雪板
I called it the "Storeski End Hutch".

230
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,520
大卫·索尔还因此给了我签名照
David Soul gave me a signed picture.

231
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,110
有一天  那张照不见了
Well, one day, the picture disappears

232
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,470
厄尔假装自己是无辜的
and Earl plays innocent.

233
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,640
但其实多年来他就是真凶
But the whole time, he's had it.

234
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,170
真讽刺  这剧情能拍成
Ironically, this would've been

235
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,290
很好看的一集《警界双雄》呢
a great episode in "Starsky and Hutch."

236
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,590
偷那副画
Steal that picture!

237
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,780
可是鱼怎么办
But what about the fish?

238
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,720
别管鱼了
Forget the fish!

239
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,650
所以说
Oh, so, for no reason,

240
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,650
我这条红鲱鱼白拿了
I've just been carrying around this red herring?

241
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,880
我要那副画
I want that picture.

242
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,650
你想要就自己来偷
You want it, you steal it.

243
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,360
我还是有点自尊的
I still have some self-respect.

244
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,220
歌洛莉亚  你肯定不敢相信
Gloria, you won't believe this.

245
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,780
什么
What?

246
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,880
刚才克莱尔打来
That was Claire.

247
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,330
曼尼没去卢克的派对
Manny never showed up at Luke's party.

248
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,830
他们觉得他是去苏菲家的派对了
They think he went to Sophie's.

249
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,370
我对他真失望
So disappointed in him.

250
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,470
我知道  我也不想开车过去
I know, and I hate to drive over there

251
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,560
揪他去卢克的派对
and drag him to Luke's,

252
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,860
但我知道至少比试图阻止你要容易点
but I know better than to try to stop you.

253
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,460
虽然下他面子不太好
I feel bad about embarrassing him,

254
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,120
但这件事我已经跟他说清楚过
but I was very clear about this.

255
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,110
可能下次他就会懂你意思[拿到照片]了
Well, maybe next time he'll... get the picture.

256
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,130
你为什么要笑得这么诡异
Why did you just chuckle like that?

257
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,550
没事  胡子有点痒
Nothing. The -- The beard tickles.

258
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,570
来吧  我开车
Come on, I'll drive.

259
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,970
-给你  -抱歉我忘了带上尾巴了
- Here you go. - Sorry I forgot that, buddy.

260
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,970
我本来可以自己去拿的
I would have grabbed it myself,

261
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,730
但我们想尊重你的
but we were trying to respect

262
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,130
"无父母"派对
the whole "No parents" thing.

263
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,770
对了  如果我进你的派对找尾巴[监视]
Also, how would it look if I went into your party

264
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,050
感觉会很怪吧
looking for some tail?

265
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,210
这笑话下次还要再讲一遍  假装没听过
I'm gonna reuse that later. Act surprised.

266
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,190
好
Yeah.

267
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,850
亲爱的  里面情况如何
Hey, honey. How's it going in there?

268
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,920
超棒的
Huh? Oh. Awesome.

269
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,110
我得走了
Yeah, I got to go.

270
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,150
我知道你会说我是个
I know you were going to say

271
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,790
神经质的保护欲过度的妈妈  可是我...
that I'm being a neurotic, overly protective mom, but I --

272
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,210
我也看出来了  卢克有点不对劲
I saw that, too. Something's up with Luke.

273
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,280
你觉得他是不是搞不定
You think he's in over his head?

274
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,760
我得去查查他  我该去吗
I should check on him. Should I check on him?

275
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,820
我该去查查他
I should check on him.

276
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,160
你比我还疯的时候最性感
You are never sexier than when you out-crazy me.

277
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,640
不要让任何人发现你
Don't let anyone see you.

278
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,910
我已经...
I am way a...

279
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,640
领先你一"头"了
head of you.

280
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,030
我不是真的海狸  是我  你爸
Shh! I'm not a real beaver! It's me -- Dad!

281
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,260
你在搞什么鬼
What are you doing?

282
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,730
我只是想确认一切没事
I just wanted to make sure everything's okay.

283
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,070
卢克看起来很难过
Luke seems upset.

284
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,770
大家都去哪儿了
Where is everybody?

285
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:03,440
都跑去楼上了吗  我说了不准上楼
Are people upstairs? I said nobody upstairs!

286
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,550
楼上没人  连楼下也没人
Nobody's upstairs. Nobody's even downstairs.

287
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,450
这里大概也就五个人而已
They are literally like five people here.

288
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,170
你好啊  我最亲爱的
Hello, my dearest.

289
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,130
好吧  四个人  加一个罗本
Well, four, and Reuben.

290
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,120
我看你扮的是"世界上最美的女人"
I see your costume is The Most Beautiful Woman in the World.

291
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,860
闭嘴  罗本  你让一切都变得很瞎
Shut up, Reuben. You make everything terrible.

292
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,930
所以我们散了
And we're off.

293
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,880
别自作多情
Don't flatter yourself!

294
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,160
就因为我自己过万圣节
Just because I'm alone on Halloween

295
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,220
不代表我没有很多追求者
doesn't mean I don't have plenty of suitors!

296
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,340
上周  一个优步司机请求看我的美足呢
Last week, an Uber driver asked to see my feet!

297
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,610
罗本  你在听我说吗
Reuben, are you listening to me?!

298
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,330
罗本
Reuben!

299
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,850
-最后一个  -很好  因为你现在在颤抖
- One last one. - Good. 'Cause you're vibrating right now.

300
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,420
是气到发抖  不是糖吃多了  是愤怒
With rage -- Not sugar, rage.

301
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,830
你们好  打扰一下  你好
Hello. Excuse me. Hi.

302
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,860
你们有没有见到一个这么高的死小鬼
Have you seen a little brat about this tall

303
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,880
扮的是黑武士
dressed as Darth Vader?

304
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,090
扔鸡蛋  像这样笑
Throws eggs. Laughs like this --

305
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,560
自己去找  你是蝙蝠侠
Find him yourself. You're Batman.

306
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,680
这小孩记我仇敌名单上了
That one's on my list.

307
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,420
你的名单早记满了吧
I don't think there's any more room.

308
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,840
我去把这些苹果扔了
I'm gonna go throw away these apples

309
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,580
给糖果腾点位置
and make space for more candy.

310
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,840
小卡  你被鸡蛋砸了我也很难受
Cam, I feel terrible that you got hit with an egg,

311
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,910
但你把莉莉的万圣夜毁了
but you're ruining the night for Lily.

312
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,920
你一定要这么眦睚必报吗
Do you have to nurse every single grudge?

313
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,520
-我才不那样  -你在逗我吗
- I don't do that. - Are you kidding me?

314
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,340
你的死敌比真正的蝙蝠侠都多
You have more archenemies than the actual Batman.

315
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,440
想想那个帮你选围巾的女售货员
How about that sales lady who helped you with the scarf?

316
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,660
她暗示我的脖子是问题所在
She implied my neck was the problem.

317
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,300
和你共事的那个西班牙语老师呢
The Spanish teacher you've been working with?

318
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,590
他叫我"疯豆[西语]"  
He calls me "locos frijoles" 

319
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,780
好像我不懂那什么意思似的
like I don't know what that means.

320
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,480
-是"疯豆"对吗  -是的
- It's "crazy beans," right? - Yes, it is.

321
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,870
别忘了还有你原来合唱团的安德鲁
Oh, and don't forget about Andrew from your old choir.

322
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,700
他偷了我的琴键围巾  这也是
He stole my piano key scarf, which is why

323
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,260
我一开始要去那破围巾店的原因
I had to go into the stupid scarf store to begin with!

324
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:22,860
好吧  你知道吗
Okay, you know what?

325
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,980
或许我确实正义感过度了
Maybe I do have an overdeveloped sense of justice.

326
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,590
-谢谢你  -但如果我伴侣
- Thank you. - But maybe I wouldn't...

327
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,010
时常站我这边  我可能不会这样
if my partner took my side every once in a while.

328
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,040
我认同你时就会站你这边
I take your side when I agree with you.

329
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,220
那很简单  任何人都能做到
That's easy. Anybody can do that.

330
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,450
婚姻的意义在于  即使不认同
Marriage is about sticking up for your partner,

331
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,190
也要支持你的伴侣
even...when you don't agree with him.

332
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,290
是吗
Is it?

333
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,410
还记得上周午饭
Do you remember last week at lunch

334
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,520
他们给你送来标准薯条
when they brought you regular fries

335
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,920
你坚持你点的是地瓜薯条吗
and you insisted that you ordered sweet potato fries?

336
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,200
知道吗
Well, guess what.

337
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,150
你点的就是标准薯条
You ordered regular fries.

338
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,170
-不  我没有  -你绝对是那样
- No, I didn't. - You absolutely did.

339
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,350
但因为我爱你  所以我支持你
And I stuck up for you because I love you.

340
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,850
也因为你爱地瓜薯条
And because you love sweet potato fries.

341
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,910
-老爸  -怎么了
- Hey, Dad. - What?

342
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,530
你讨厌的孩子在那里
There's that kid you hate.

343
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,560
我了个万圣节啊  他在那儿
Holy Halloween. There he is.

344
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,750
说你呢  站住
Hey! You! Stop!

345
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:06,890
不好
No.

346
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,430
{\an8}1966年电视剧《蝙蝠侠》的过场与追击音效

347
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,750
他要逃掉了
He's getting away!

348
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,480
臭斗篷
Stupid cape!

349
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,720
可怜的卢克  他肯定很心碎
Oh, poor Luke. He must be crushed.

350
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,330
这年头让高中派对满是人不像
It's not as easy to pack a high-school party

351
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,970
我们那时那么简单了  克莱尔
as it was in our day, Claire.

352
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,160
而且貌似孩子们邀请
Apparently, it's no longer cool

353
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,280
老师家长不再算酷了
for kids to invite teachers or parents.

354
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,000
让我好心痛
It makes my heart hurt.

355
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,820
大家是喜欢他的吧  不是吗
I mean, people like him, don't they?

356
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,560
怎么会不喜欢
Why wouldn't they?

357
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,860
他可是目前我们孩子中最讨人喜欢的
He's by far the most likable of all our children.

358
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,880
那为什么没人来他的派对
Then why didn't anybody come to his party?

359
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,760
因为人都去了苏菲·钱伯斯的派对
Because they're all at Sophie Chambers' party.

360
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,480
-谁  -卢克班上的一个孩子
- Who? - A kid in Luke's class.

361
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,630
我和她哥哥是脸书朋友
I'm Facebook friends with her brother

362
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,380
因为他过去卖我大[麻]发  假发
'cause he used to sell me wee-gs. Wigs.

363
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,250
他就是这么发音的  他是英国人
That's how he pronounces it. He's British.

364
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,730
你们怎么不说话呢
When are you guys gonna talk, huh?

365
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,320
卢克为了这场派对很下功夫
Luke worked so hard on this party.

366
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,700
他自制了服装  包揽了所有装饰
He made his own costume, did all the decorations.

367
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,730
他甚至还以为自己
He even thought he hid that bottle of

368
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,310
成功藏了瓶薄荷甜酒在床底下
Peppermint Schnapps under his bed.

369
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,090
就是这种事会毁了他的第一轮高三
This is the kind of thing that could ruin his first senior year.

370
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,110
慢着  我能帮上忙
Wait! I can help!

371
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,140
我们忘了我是做什么工作的吗
Are we forgetting what I do for a living? Huh?

372
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,190
我们记得啊
Uh, we remember.

373
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,100
你  假装和名人是朋友
You...pretend to be friends with celebrities.

374
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,600
以便你能卖  帽子
So you can sell h-- hats?

375
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,770
我是推销能手
I'm a promoter.

376
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,700
我可以去苏菲的派对上大赞卢克的派对
I can go to Sophie's and talk up Luke's party.

377
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,560
-一个小时后  绝对人满  -太棒了
- In an hour, it'll be packed. - Great!

378
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,910
与此同时  我去让派对嗨起来
While you do that, I'm gonna get the party started.

379
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,670
什么  不  不
What -- No, no.

380
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,150
有老爸在只会让派对更逊
A dad hanging around will only make that party lamer.

381
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,860
老爸  或许会
Um, a dad, maybe.

382
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,700
但罗德·天助不会
But not Rod Skyhook, yo!

383
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,420
史上最酷的新来转学生
The coolest new transfer student ever!

384
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,050
等等
Oh, wait.

385
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,310
现在的酷小孩一般怎么称呼女孩
What do cool kids call girls nowadays?

386
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,370
美人儿  美眉
Bettys? Shawties?

387
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,690
别担心  反正里面没有
Don't worry. There are none in there.

388
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,470
好
Okay.

389
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,630
什  什么  
What, what?

390
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,390
真庆幸我的低血糖症
I'm glad my hypoglycemia

391
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,020
不会害我不准眼睛大吃糖心美人
doesn't prevent me from filling up on eye candy.

392
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,470
抱歉  我听不到你说话
Sorry. I can't hear you.

393
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,430
我在听物理系
I'm listening to a message

394
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,620
最性感教授的语音留言
from the sexiest professor in the physics department.

395
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,710
这么说吧  他去年一次研讨会上喝醉了
Let's just say he got drunk after a symposium last year

396
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:56,090
可是选了本小姐开车送他回家呢
and asked me to wheel him home.

397
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,940
感谢你邀请我来派对  兄弟
Thanks for inviting me to your party, brah!

398
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,400
音乐不错  小姑娘们都在哪呢
Sweet jams. Where are all the fillies at?!

399
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,790
-老爸  -老爸
- Dad? - Dad?

400
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,730
我是罗德·天助  刚来的转学生
I'm Rod Skyhook -- recent transfer student, yo!

401
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,100
那酷爆[牙啃]的声响从何而来
What's that knockin'?

402
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,390
是我  即将让这个派对炫酷起来
Oh, it's me, about to get this party rockin'!

403
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,380
天哪
Oh, God.

404
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,830
我的地界什么都是棒棒哒  小婊砸们
It's all good up under the hood, biznatches!

405
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,240
不出多久  这里的每个孩子
Pretty soon, every kid in here's

406
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,210
都会打电话给所有认识的人
gonna call everyone they know,

407
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,610
叫他们赶快过来
tell them to get their butts down here.

408
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,940
如果你想进一步增加人口流动量...
You want to gas up the foot traffic --

409
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,860
我是不会邀请家长们来的
I'm not inviting parents.

410
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,160
你的派对你说了算  兄弟
Your party, broseph!

411
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,320
不好意思  兄弟
Sorry, Jack.

412
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,400
给本舞王来点节奏
I'm gonna need some beats!

413
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,070
兰博
Rambo?

414
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,470
不  是特朗勃
No, Trumbo.

415
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,980
达尔顿·特朗勃  他在浴缸里写剧本
Dalton Trumbo. He wrote in the bathtub.

416
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,000
为什么
Why?

417
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,310
或许因为是个编剧
Maybe, as a screenwriter,

418
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,610
他知道编剧奖金肯定会大跳水[浴缸后侧洗澡]
he knew he was going to take a bath on the back end.

419
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,790
你一身鱼腥味
You smell like fish.

420
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,540
我的天  妹子们  这个派对太无聊了
Oh, my God, you guys. This party's such a snore.

421
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,060
我真不该离开卢克·邓菲的派对
I should have stayed at Luke Dunphy's party.

422
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,240
那边都疯得没边了
That was going off!

423
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,310
他不是那个为了一块钱
Isn't he the guy that ate

424
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,790
吃了一整罐蛋黄酱的家伙吗
a jar of mayonnaise for a dollar?

425
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,760
大概吧  因为他是个野性奇男子啊
Probably, 'cause he's a wild man.

426
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,990
所以他的派对总是那么疯狂
That's why his parties are always insane.

427
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,190
那派对可不是谁都能进去
Look, it's really exclusive,

428
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,320
但我大概能把你们加进邀请名单
but I could probably get you guys down on the list.

429
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,490
真的吗  都有谁在那
Really? Who's there?

430
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,310
受欢迎的都在  有卢克
Uh, just everyone. Luke...

431
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,160
还有罗德·天助
Rod Skyhook.

432
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,320
海莉·邓
Haley D!

433
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,390
格里芬
Griffin. Hey.

434
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,150
你怎么来我老妹的派对了
What are you doing at my sister's party?

435
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,610
没什么  帮我妈办点事
Oh, nothing. Just-Just something for my mom.

436
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,080
见到你真是太好了
Wow, it's so good to see you.

437
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,600
你还在做"销售"业吗
You, uh, still in the sales industry?

438
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,420
惭愧惭愧
Guilty.

439
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,500
有多惭愧  你这身囚衣是变装还是真的
How guilty? That is a costume, right?

440
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,800
是变装  我现在合法销售了
Yeah. I went legit.

441
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,590
我在药房工作  我送货
I work for a dispensary. I deliver.

442
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,090
我的天哪
Oh, my God!

443
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,660
我都忘了你有多讨人喜欢了
I forgot how much I like you.

444
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,520
你说的是小飞象吗
Did you say Dumbo?

445
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,580
不是  是特朗勃
No, Trumbo.

446
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,690
给你补充点背景知识
Little background.

447
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,700
在五十年代   威斯康星州某个
In the 1950s, a certain senator from Wisconsin

448
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,890
名叫乔·麦卡锡的参议员
named Joe McCarthy --

449
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,940
涨知识不如跳舞
Hey! Let's dance!

450
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,040
好吧
Oh, okay.

451
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,770
妈
Mom?

452
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,890
你说你会去卢克家的
You said that you were going to Luke's.

453
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,910
是的  可是杰说
Yeah, but Jay said --

454
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,320
你休想再狡辩  年轻人
Don't you say a word, mister!

455
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,840
我晚点再处理你
I will deal with you later.

456
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,680
杰说只要我往厄尔的鞋里放死鱼
Jay said I could come to the party

457
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
我就可以到这个派对来
if I put dead fish in Earl's shoes.

458
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,310
他这些瞎话都是怎么编出来的
Where does he come up with this stuff?

459
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,890
你扮成救世主  居然还敢说谎
Are you lying, dressed as our Lord and Savior?

460
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,930
那是什么  是你刚偷来的吗
What is that? Did you steal that?

461
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,160
不是  我一整晚都随身带着呢
No. I've had this with me all night.

462
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,720
你又说谎
You're lying again!

463
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,670
曼尼  离他远点
Manny, don't stand next to him!

464
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,690
普里契特
Pritchett!

465
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,170
瞧瞧你干的好事
Look what you did!

466
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,190
你这是在干什么
What the hell do you think you're doing?

467
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,650
我们正要走人  厄尔
We're just leaving, Earl!

468
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,240
那张索尔照[灵魂]是我的
That Soul is mine.

469
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,350
-还回来  -等地狱冰封了再说吧
- Give it back! - When hell freezes over!

470
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,080
你过来  厄尔  你给我过来
Come here, Earl! Come here!

471
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,360
一旦他们不再为
As soon as they stop fighting

472
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,660
新找的这个什么破由头打架了
about whatever stupid new thing that they're fighting about,

473
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,540
我们就上车去卢克家
we're getting the car and we're going to Luke's.

474
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,320
我真的没心情去另一个派对了
I'm not really in the mood for another party.

475
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,940
我今晚也没心情侮辱上帝
Well, I wasn't in the mood to insult God tonight,

476
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,910
但《圣经》上还说要"听老公的话"
but the Bible also said, "Listen to your husband."

477
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,080
我对这事看得很认真  别跟我作对
I'm very tense about this, so don't fight me!

478
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:55,950
给我上车去
And get in the car.

479
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:56,760
容不下我
I won't fit in.

480
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,150
那就把浴缸放到车顶上
We'll take this bathtub and put it in the roof.

481
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,150
不  我是说那个派对容不下我的
No. I won't fit in at the party.

482
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,500
没人会懂我这变装的哏  妈
Nobody gets me, Mom,

483
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,310
我开始担心永远也不会有人懂我了
and I'm starting to worry nobody ever will.

484
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,800
你的同龄人不懂你又怎么样
Who cares that the kids your age don't get you?

485
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,240
那意味着你比他们都有趣多了
That means that you're more interesting than them.

486
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,270
那意味着你会结交
That means that you're gonna be hanging out around people

487
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,260
更有趣的人
that are more interesting.

488
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,320
你会拥有
You're gonna have a more inter-

489
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,080
更有趣的人生  是啊  我知道
Interesting life. Yes, I know.

490
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,960
我从五岁起就听你这么说了
I've been hearing this speech since I was 5.

491
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,040
什么时候才能成真啊
When's it gonna happen?

492
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,400
耶稣都对恶魔用锁头功了
Jesus has the devil in a headlock.

493
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,710
你还不觉得有趣吗
That's not interesting to you?

494
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,520
不
No!

495
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,730
这是我的
This is mine!

496
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,370
是我想出的柜"索"雪橇这个哏
I'm the one who came up with "Storeski End Hutch."

497
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,820
就像我想出"女医生药恩"这个哏一样
Just like I came up with the "Dr. Quinn Medicine Cabinet."

498
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,820
{\an8}改自1993年电视剧《女医生奎恩》

499
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,600
你只会抄袭  我才是创新者
You were the hack! I was the visionary!

500
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,770
我看到自己的倒影  不禁自问
I saw my reflection and I asked myself --

501
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:36,960
如果是耶稣会怎么做
What would Jesus do?

502
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,540
我是时候做个更大度的人了
It's time to be the bigger man.

503
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,420
这事没完  普里契特
This isn't over, Pritchett.

504
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,480
我不想再和你争下去了
I don't want to do this anymore.

505
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,560
你什么意思
Wh-What are you saying?

506
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,680
已经争了太久了  所有的谎言与愤怒
This has gone on too long. The lies, the anger.

507
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,770
以及我今晚在你袜子抽屉里留下的东西
And what I left in your sock drawer tonight.

508
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,540
什么
What?

509
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,840
签名照你留着吧  厄尔  我宽恕你
Keep the picture, Earl. I forgive you.

510
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,710
这样肯定会吓疯那个老混账的
It's gonna drive that son of a bitch crazy.

511
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,080
海莉
Haley.

512
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,150
我都等了一小时了
I have been waiting for over an hour,

513
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,210
然而没有一个人离开这个派对
and not a single person has left this party.

514
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,840
我的天  这是我吃过最好吃的寿司
Oh, my God, this is the best sushi I've ever had.

515
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,240
我第一次能吃出海产的黄狮鱼味
For the first time, I can taste the yellowtail from the sea

516
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,500
和陆产的大米味
and then the rice from the land,

517
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,830
然后又回到海产的海苔味
then back to the sea for the seaweed.

518
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,700
我看你吃海草前还吸了点别的"草"
Looks like you did more than just seaweed.

519
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,710
妈  你太美了
Mom, you're beautiful.

520
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,780
老爸有没有时常夸你美
Does Dad tell you that enough?

521
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,670
如果你的头真的被菜刀砍了
I would hate to see a cleaver

522
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,080
-我会很伤心的  -别说了  宝贝
- in your head for real. - No. Honey.

523
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,600
-莎拉  -邓菲太太
- Sarah? - Mrs. Dunphy.

524
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,420
那是啤酒吗
Is that a beer?

525
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,300
不是我的  求你别告诉我爸妈
It's not mine. Please don't tell my parents.

526
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,370
这一刻我突然意识到
That's when I realized

527
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,650
我根本不需要海莉替我搞垮这个派对
I didn't need Haley to undermine a party.

528
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,380
我只需要释放一个"妈妈炸弹"
I just needed to drop the Mom-bomb.

529
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,030
你们俩别爽过头了
Don't you two look cozy.

530
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,570
别忘了  单亲妈妈养大一个孩子不容易的
Remember, it's not easy raising a baby by yourself.

531
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,310
快看呀
Oh, look at that!

532
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,840
酒精果冻的吃法可太有趣了
That's a fun way to serve Jell-O.

533
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,640
我得赶紧拍张照片给你们妈妈
Let me get a pic for your moms.

534
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,540
不好吗  别走啊
No? Come on!

535
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,270
好了好了
Okay. Ooh!

536
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:01,400
现在是不是好多了
Isn't that better?

537
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,510
这下我们终于可以看清楚和听清楚对方了
Now we can all see and hear each other.

538
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,160
不错吧 
Nice, huh?

539
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,510
你脸上有点脏东西
You got a little something --

540
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,050
你是哪位  跑来我的派对上搞什么鬼啊
Who are you, and what are you doing at my party?

541
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,090
来确保大家有一个舒适  干净又"安全"的夜晚
Just making sure everybody's having a good, clean, safe time.

542
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,890
有人跟你们讲过关于疱疹的那些事了吧
Somebody's talked to you all about herpes, right?

543
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,630
我们还是去另一个小子的派对吧
Let's just go to that other kid's party.

544
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,710
我跟你说  我跟那个罗德·天助亲热过呢
You know, I made out with Rod Skyhook once.

545
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,020
他超迷我的
He's obsessed with me.

546
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,440
还记得上个星期我们一起吃午饭的时候
Hey, remember last week when we all had lunch together --

547
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,200
你点的是普通薯条  然后大爸帮你撒谎了
You ordered the regular fries and Daddy lied for you.

548
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,890
我去
Damn it.

549
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,220
慢着  他就在那
Wait. There he is.

550
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,730
黑武士  不许动
Darth Vader! Freeze!

551
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,090
好吧
Okay.

552
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,370
你好啊  朋友
Hey, there, fellas.

553
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,120
你看起来有点力不从心啊
You're a little old, aren't you?

554
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,710
你儿子  他拿鸡蛋扔了我
Your son -- He hit me with an egg.

555
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,170
我才没有  而且他还吼我了
No, I didn't! And he yelled at me.

556
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,910
慢着  慢着  你凶我儿子了吗
Whoa, whoa. You yelled at my son?

557
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,710
他抓了一大把糖还嘲讽大笑
He took a handful of candy and laughed.

558
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,120
他每年都这样
He does it every year.

559
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,130
所以呢
So?

560
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,020
所以
So...

561
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,120
你现在什么感觉
...how does it feel?

562
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,960
我感觉  你拿走了大概17分钱左右的糖
Well, it feels like you took about 17 cents worth of candy.

563
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,750
而我儿子也说没扔你鸡蛋  能完事了吗
He said he didn't egg you. Are we done here?

564
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,610
他骗人
He's lying.

565
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,550
我没有
No, I'm not.

566
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,240
好了  哥们  我不知道是谁拿鸡蛋扔了你
Look, buddy. I don't know who egged you,

567
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,760
不过我完全理解他为什么要扔你
but I can understand why.

568
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,560
小屁孩多抓了一点糖  你就追杀他到家
A kid takes a little extra candy and you chased him home?

569
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,700
他才9岁
He's 9.

570
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,520
你多大了  蝙蝠侠  50岁吗
How old are you, Batman? 50?

571
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,570
什么样人才能做出这么无聊的事啊
What kind of person does that?

572
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,830
我来  我来告诉你他是什么样的人
I will -- I will tell you what kind of person.

573
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,560
一个信仰文明社会的人
Someone who believes in a civilized society,

574
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,060
一个相信我们国家的未来就寄托在
who believes that the future of our country

575
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,570
我们现在怎么教育我们的孩子的人
depends on the lessons that we teach our children.

576
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,170
这位"什么样的人"
"What kind of person," Sir?

577
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,530
是一个英雄
A hero.

578
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,250
我真的没扔啊
I didn't do it!

579
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,260
得了吧  我们都听到你的笑声了
Oh, come on. We heard you laughing!

580
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,380
那是因为一个头上插着斧子的金发女人
'Cause the blonde lady with an axe in her head

581
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,560
冲你们扔了一个鸡蛋
threw an egg at you.

582
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
-金发女人  -斧子
- Blonde lady? - Axe?

583
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,190
那个喷水的整人花真是惹到我了
That squirting flower really yanked my chain.

584
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,060
此仇不报非君子
Could not go unanswered.

585
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,340
打中他也行了
Oh! Close enough.

586
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,310
谁干的
Who did that?!

587
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,810
他朝那边跑了
He went that way!

588
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,530
好吧  刚才确实挺丢脸的
Well, that was embarrassing.

589
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,270
不  不是这样的
No, it wasn't.

590
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,320
刚才你的表现很伟大
It was magnificent.

591
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,950
你为了我挺身而出
You stood up for me.

592
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,710
很多时候我都感觉是我一个人在对抗整个世界
Sometimes I just feel like it's me versus the entire world.

593
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,000
很高兴能知道我们两个人真的是
It's just nice to know that we really are a...

594
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,150
肝胆相照的强力二人组
a dynamic duo.

595
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,520
好了  吃糖后的崩溃来了[玩糖果爆破]
All right. Now we play candy crash.

596
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,460
好
Okay.

597
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,160
给我一点空间  小样儿
Give me some space, son.

598
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,450
爷就是这么拽着  废柴们
That's how we do, sucka!

599
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,070
这一切都只是我的想象
Is it just my imagination,

600
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:39,020
还是老爸真的挽救了你的蹩脚派对
or is Dad actually saving your lame party?

601
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,710
这一切都只是我的想象
Is it just my imagination,

602
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,740
还是你下巴上沾的真是罗本脸上的妆
or is Reuben's makeup on your chin?

603
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,400
我这是病  得治
I have a problem.

604
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,200
对不起
Oh! Sorry.

605
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,470
没事
Oh, okay.

606
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,340
实在很抱歉

歌洛莉亚  恕我直言
