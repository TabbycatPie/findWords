56
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,540
They're just getting the lobby ready for the big party.

57
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,220
It's an annual fundraiser.

58
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,660
Like a carnival?

59
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,110
No, it's a swanky, black-tie ball.

60
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,630
You think a hospital lobby is swanky?

61
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,210
Not yet, but add some lights, a few decorations,

62
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,580
and, most importantly, alcohol...

63
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,110
It becomes a streamer- and balloon-infested hospital lobby

64
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,520
with a cash bar.

65
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,120
It's for charity.

66
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,390
Better to spend the money for the cause.

67
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,740
Actually, it's worse.

68
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,520
You need to spend money to make money.

69
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,300
I don't like parties.

70
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,050
Doesn't matter.

71
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,770
All residents will be expected to attend and make a donation.

72
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,090
This is Dr. Alex Park.

73
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,430
He's the last of Coyle's residents

74
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,160
to be reassigned to our team.

75
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,840
Meet doctors Jared Kalu,

76
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,090
Claire Browne, and Shaun Murphy.

77
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,600
Nice to meet you.

78
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,000
Welcome back. How was Costa Rica?

79
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,700
Beaches were awesome. Monkeys were horrible.

80
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,320
Little bastards stole my new camera and a pair of --

81
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,870
How old are you?

82
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,360
45.

83
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,020
That's even older than Dr. Melendez.

84
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,740
Dr. Murphy is a talented doctor who has autism,

85
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,560
which sometimes causes him to ask inappropriate questions.

86
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,190
No worries. Inappropriate questions can be very revealing.

87
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,120
I'm a late bloomer.

88
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,160
Park's being modest, which is very unlike him.

89
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,190
He was a cop for 15 years before he went to med school.

90
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,720
Now that we all know each other,

91
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,790
Reznick and Browne have dibs on cases this week.

92
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,960
You make your picks?

93
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,120
- Yes. - Definitely.

94
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,030
Is there karaoke?

95
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,800
And now, our all-star lineup!

96
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,640
Playing center, out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

97
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,970
Spirit, stop it.

98
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,450
They don't have time to fool around.

99
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,590
I'm not fooling around.

100
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,870
I need to document the momentous event.

101
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,230
Then at least get it right.

102
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,730
I'm from Taipei, Taiwan.

103
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,390
Co-o-orrection!

104
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,230
From Taipei, Taiwan --

105
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,280
which I believe is a suburb of Moose Jaw --

106
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,840
Dr. Audrey Lim!

107
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:37,070
And assisting Dr. Lim are...

108
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,160
two docs I've never met.

109
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,890
Hello.

110
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,560
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy from Casper, Wyoming.

111
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,310
And...?

112
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,540
Dr. Morgan Reznick, Mill Valley, California.

113
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,900
Represent!

114
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,520
Okay, Spirit, that's enough.

115
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,900
All right, put your phone away,

116
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,390
or it becomes my phone.

117
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,890
Well, folks, looks like the suits are shuttin' me down.

118
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,230
Thanks for all your support.

119
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,100
Love you! Bye!

120
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,180
Sorry, but my friends insist I keep them up to date.

121
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,030
It's all right. It's a big day.

122
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,380
Spirit was born with ectopia cordis. She's been --

123
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,420
Why didn't they repair it when she was an infant?

124
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,410
They couldn't. Her rib cage was too small.

125
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,380
But after 14 years of slow and steady growth...

126
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,000
It's time to put this baby where it belongs.

127
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,610
This is an interesting view.

128
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,770
I can see the aortic arch.

129
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,350
- Murphy. - Oh, it's all right.

130
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,470
I'm used to people being curious.

131
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,580
I'm sure you're looking forward

132
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,760
to when there's nothing to be curious about.

133
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,430
What I'm really looking forward to is...crowds.

134
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,990
You like crowds?

135
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,220
I don't know.

136
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,870
I've never been in one.

137
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,270
I can't go to a normal school,

138
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,900
and my parents barely ever let me leave our house.

139
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,620
Well, when a small bump could stop your heart, it makes sense.

140
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,050
But you still have a lot of friends?

141
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,830
Yeah, of course.

142
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,250
I mean, I just can't do anything fun with them.

143
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,910
If you can't do anything fun,

144
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,090
then how did you get them to be your friend?

145
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,130
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

146
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,730
I like to talk.

147
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,870
- Yes. - ‭And, we all do everything online now anyway.

148
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,350
The first thing I'm gonna do when I get out of here

149
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,260
is take all my friends to a concert.

150
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,280
Like, general admission, on the floor.

151
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,440
I don't even care who the band is,

152
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,500
just as long as the place is packed.

153
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,970
And I'm gonna hug everyone.

154
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,410
You've never hugged anyone?

155
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,570
Not even your parents?

156
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,360
Kissed by my parents, high-fived by my friends,

157
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,630
but, nope, no hugs.

158
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,630
It's just too risky.

159
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,730
Hugs make me feel trapped.

160
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,710
‭Sorry.

161
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,870
Almost done.

162
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,920
Pain in the upper-right quadrant.

163
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,410
It's jaundice.

164
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,900
Bilirubin's off the chart.

165
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,310
That doesn't make sense.

166
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,230
He's been doing so well since the transplant.

167
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah, every check-up this year's been perfect.

168
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,770
Well, it could just be a temporary flare-up.

169
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,430
We'll increase his anti-rejection meds

170
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,870
and do a full liver exam.

171
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,120
We'll know more then.

172
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,930
You two, do the work-up.

173
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,450
And you find a new liver.

174
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,890
Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy result?

175
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,830
Not when I already know what it's gonna say.

176
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,890
He needs a new liver ASAP.

177
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,120
I mean, that's gonna be hard.

178
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,260
He's Blood Type O.

179
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,150
It's gonna be impossible.

180
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,780
He's lucky they were able to find the first one.

181
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,030
Well, he better get lucky again

182
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:34,080
because it's our only way to keep him alive.

183
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,620
We're screwed.

184
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,920
Barbara Boxer got ear barotrauma scuba-diving in Cozumel

185
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,080
and cannot fly for two weeks,

186
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
which means we don't have a keynote speaker for our gala.

187
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,950
You think this is funny?

188
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,480
I've just never seen you anxious,

189
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,420
and I seriously doubt Barbara Boxer scuba-dives.

190
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,410
It's just an excuse.

191
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,020
She sent me a picture from the hospital.

192
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,030
- Really? - Yeah.

193
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,660
Anyone can fake a photograph.

194
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,550
What are you doing?

195
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,510
I am doing a search to see if our esteemed senator

196
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,360
from the great state of California ever once -- once --

197
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,660
talked about scuba-diving in an interview.

198
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,780
It doesn't matter if it's true.

199
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,380
What matters is that we find a replacement.

200
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,560
I need you to get me a meeting with Aiden Coulter.

201
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,000
- Aiden Coulter? ‭- Yes.

202
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,420
What? I sat next to him once at an A's game.

203
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,660
And the story I remember is that

204
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,090
you two were talking smack that entire game,

205
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,930
and after he spilled his beer on you

206
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,010
and insisted on buying you a new jacket,

207
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,240
you refused him.

208
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,560
So he owes you.

209
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,680
Just get me a meeting.

210
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
I'll handle everything from there.

211
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,750
Okay.

212
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,420
I'll see what I can do.

213
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,240
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

215
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,970
You'll be fine.

216
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,610
You've had liver biopsies before.

217
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,600
And they've always hurt a lot.

218
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,160
Please, isn't there another way?

219
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,440
Well, the other way, Eric, would going through your neck,

220
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,380
and I don't think you'd like that any more.

221
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,130
Eric, do you know why NBA players

222
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,200
all wear headphones before games?

223
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,410
Don't look at him. Look at me.

224
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,870
I need you to answer me.

225
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
Why do NBA players wear headphones before games?

226
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
I don't know.

227
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,870
I guess they like music.

228
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,400
No, they need music.

229
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,740
Music helps them forget about everything else

230
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,430
and focus on what's important --

231
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,520
the game.

232
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,190
Who's your favorite player?

233
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,190
Curry.

234
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,430
Okay.

235
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,900
This is the song he listens to before every game.

236
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,620
How do you know?

237
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,700
Because he's my favorite player, too.

238
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,360
I want you to close your eyes and focus on this.

239
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,780
Just this.

240
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,130
It's cold.

241
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,830
Yeah, now it is, but if you stay focused,

242
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,650
pretty soon, it'll stop feeling cold

243
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,930
and start to feel warm.

244
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,760
When that happens, I want you to nod your head,

245
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,190
and you'll feel some pressure and a small pinch.

246
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,330
What if it does --

247
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,380
Then close your eyes and focus.

248
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,360
You ready?

249
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,800
Two minutes and he'll be good to go.

250
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,070
How'd you know he was a basketball fan?

251
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,120
His shoes.

252
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,030
He's not wearing any shoes.

253
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,060
Yeah, they're in a backpack in his room.

254
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,460
You searched his backpack?

255
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,200
Well, it's, um, less invasive than a rectal,

256
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,170
and most of the time more useful.

257
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,250
Okay, Spirit, just keep still and --

258
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,530
And during a few parts of the exam,

259
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,870
we may ask you to hold your breath,

260
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,880
but it'll only be a few seconds.

261
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,270
You got it.

262
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,130
You gonna buy a tux or rent one?

263
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,620
The fundraiser is black tie.

264
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,370
I have a suit.

265
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,370
It's new.

266
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,170
I bought it for my resident interviews.

267
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,010
It doesn't matter how new it is.

268
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,480
It's not a tux.

269
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,590
Wearing a uniform at work reassures patients.

270
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,800
Wearing a uniform at a party does nothing

271
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,320
but make you hot and uncomfortable.

272
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,100
This party is work.

273
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,180
Get a tux.

274
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,300
And not a crappy one from some outlet store.

275
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,870
Get fitted by a pro and spend a minimum of two grand.

276
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,820
You're gonna meet rich people who can help your career,

277
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,420
and they're not gonna want to help some slob in a --

278
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,230
I'm not a slob.

279
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,840
No, I am very clean

280
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,130
and make sure my clothes are never wrinkled.

281
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,340
And it's too big.

282
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,560
Her heart.

283
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,370
It's enlarged 53% since her last exam.

284
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,200
Her last exam was only six months ago.

285
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,540
It won't fit.

286
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,960
Too big.

287
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,490
The biopsy confirmed acute cellular rejection.

288
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,330
We maximized his immuno-suppressives, but, uh --

289
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,970
I found one -- a Type-O liver.

290
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,040
Are you sure?

291
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,430
Park and I checked the registry, and there weren't any.

292
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,740
I found it online.

293
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,650
He, uh -- He already tried to make a direct donation a few months ago,

294
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,020
but the patient died before the surgery.

295
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,490
I contacted him, which wasn't easy,

296
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,350
but he still wants to be a donor.

297
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,280
That's amazing.

298
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,420
Great job.

299
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,970
What's the catch?

300
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,400
He wants to be a donor, but he's not on the registry?

301
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,260
I mean, there's got to be a catch.

302
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,490
He, uh -- He can't be on the registry

303
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,580
because he is in prison.

304
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,860
For murder.

305
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,370
Actually, um, seven murders.

306
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,160
Boris Tirayan was a Russian Mafia enforcer

307
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,860
convicted of seven murders.

308
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,660
Who now wants to make amends.

309
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,350
He tried to be a donor a few months ago,

310
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,260
but the patient died before the red tape could be worked out.

311
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,860
But now that it has...

312
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,790
Are there any laws against an inmate becoming a donor?

313
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,330
No, but there is a ton of liability.

314
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,490
What if he attacks someone here?

315
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,930
He'll be guarded by state prison guards on a separate level,

316
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,110
away from patients and all non-essential staff.

317
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,140
Everyone deserves the chance to turn their life around.

318
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,180
The guy wants to do something decent,

319
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,110
we should let him.

320
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,270
I don't think we owe a murderer anything.

321
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,960
But maybe he owes us something.

322
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,430
He has a debt to society.

323
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,870
Which he would repay by donating his inner organs.

324
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,750
Isn't it a slippery slope between a guy who wants to make amends

325
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,180
and turning our prison system into a superstore for body parts?

326
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,800
A slippery slope that saves a child's life.

327
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,430
It'll never happen.

328
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:22,030
He's just trying to get a hospital, where it'll be easier to escape.

329
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,190
You have no idea what his motivation is.

330
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,140
I know he's a lying sociopath

331
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,590
who doesn't care about anyone but himself.

332
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,960
He's been a model inmate for nine years,

333
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,670
tutors other prisoners in the library --

334
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,180
Yeah, because he's trying to get someone to trust him,

335
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,340
to give him an inch, and as soon as they do --

336
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,520
We got approval.

337
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,430
He's gonna stall, make excuses,

338
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,420
and when he sees his chance,

339
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,670
someone's gonna get hurt.

340
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,540
I think it's worth taking that chance.

341
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,320
Anybody who doesn't agree, feel free to sit this one out.

342
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,430
When you started menstruating,

343
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,390
the increased estrogen caused pulmonary hypertension,

344
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,490
which isn't a surgical issue in itself,

345
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,840
but along with your atypical vascular system --

346
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,480
Your heart's grown too big.

347
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,670
We will control your blood pressure

348
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,310
so that you will keep growing but your heart won't,

349
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,010
and then, by the time you're 18, we'll able to --

350
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,020
No.

351
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,020
I'm not waiting any longer.

352
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,420
Spirit, honey, it will be okay.

353
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,760
No, it won't!

354
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,800
I'm sick of being stuck inside all the time.

355
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,390
I'm sick of this!

356
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,710
I don't ever want to text, call, or video chat again.

357
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,010
Mom, I want to be touched.

358
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,850
I want to be shoved.

359
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:32,710
I want to be punched.

360
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,490
I don't even care, just --

361
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,120
Please.

362
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,240
Please.

363
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,870
I want this surgery now.

364
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,640
I need it.

365
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,960
I'm sorry. We can't.

366
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,730
We need to get rid of all the furniture and artwork.

367
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,200
I get removing the paintings, but the furniture?

368
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,730
Don't want the prison guards sitting down on the job.

369
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,590
He's gonna be in full restraints,

370
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,920
cuffed to the bed.

371
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,080
Well, that's our plan,

372
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,680
but we also need to be prepared for his plan.

373
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,520
Okay, we need to get rid of the window blinds,

374
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
curtain rods, jacket hooks,

375
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,100
and make sure there's no metal rivets

376
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,790
or eyelets on the mattress.

377
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,750
What's he gonna do with a metal eyelet?

378
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,380
Tear it off the mattress and file it down

379
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,350
to cut your jugular, or bend it into a handcuff key,

380
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,680
or shove it into an electric socket

381
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,800
to create a spark and start a fire.

382
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,930
I've seen knives made out of toilet paper, soap, and salt

383
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,420
that could amputate a fat guy's femur.

384
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,790
Not quite sure he needed the part about the guy being fat.

385
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,530
So...I've been thinking.

386
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,980
You want to go to the fundraiser together?

387
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,450
It's not a prom. We don't have to bring a date.

388
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,100
Yeah, we don't have to.

389
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,510
But we can, if we want.

390
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,260
Everyone basically knows we're seeing each other,

391
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,200
but still...

392
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,420
I think it might be a nice opportunity

393
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,430
to take our relationship out into the open.

394
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,250
Unless you don't want to.

395
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,570
No, it's a good idea.

396
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,600
Are you sure?

397
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,220
Because, you know, we don't have to.

398
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,630
Yeah. Let's do it.

399
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,440
Let's go.

400
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,170
What's wrong?

401
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,140
It's fine. He'll be all right.

402
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,060
No, I won't. I don't want a murderer's liver!

403
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,310
It's evil!

404
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,380
Eric, there's no such thing as a good or bad liver.

405
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,560
It's just a -- just an organ.

406
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,380
Eric, this is your only choice.

407
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,630
If we don't do the transplant, you will die.

408
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,930
I don't want him to be a part of me,

409
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,040
inside me forever, all right?

410
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,090
I don't care what you or anybody else says, okay?

411
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,080
It's my body, and I don't want it!

412
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
That's ridiculous.

413
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,480
Personality traits aren't transferred in an organ transplant.

414
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,680
It's also irrelevant.

415
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,300
Children don't consent to surgeries --

416
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,550
their parents do.

417
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,940
But if he doesn't cooperate with the anti-rejection regimen,

418
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,270
we could be wasting a liver that could save someone else's life.

419
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,480
No one's getting saved by Tirayan.

420
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,250
I found a Type-A donor. It's not a perfect match, but --

421
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,400
His body's already rejected a perfect match.

422
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,690
There's no way it can tolerate an incompatible blood type.

423
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,300
No, the only way to save Eric

424
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,520
is to do the transplant with Tirayan's liver.

425
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,430
That is it.

426
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,430
We have no other option.

427
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,330
Let the O.R. know we're gonna need more restraints.

428
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,990
Dr. Clinton Ford out of Alberta

429
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,740
developed an experimental resorbable material.

430
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,820
It would allow us to expand her rib cage

431
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,140
and create room to fit her heart inside.

432
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,560
An artificial sternum.

433
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,300
That would actually grow along with the patient.

434
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,880
The surgery isn't reversible.

435
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,070
If it doesn't work,

437
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,840
we can't just move her heart back to where it was.

438
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,550
It would allow her to have a life.

439
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,980
She has a life,

440
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,100
and she'll be healthy as long as she stays out of crowds,

441
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,070
doesn't hug anyone,

442
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,660
or do anything where she might fall.

443
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,150
I get you're autistic,

444
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,820
but I know even you realize when a patient cries

445
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,480
and throws her phone against the wall,

446
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,340
they're not happy with their current health.

447
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,050
There's no reason to make this personal.

448
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,000
There is if his medical judgment is biased.

449
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,640
I saw she was upset.

450
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,480
You saw it, but you didn't understand it.

451
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,570
You're very competitive.

452
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,740
Are you trying to make Dr. Lim think I'm biased,

453
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,250
or are you trying to undermine my confidence?

454
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,020
I'm actually trying to help you and the patient.

455
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,560
She wants to be able to rub elbows,

456
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,860
and you need to learn how to trade elbows.

457
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,490
The resorbable plate is experimental and risky.

458
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,370
But my medical judgment is that it's worth it.

459
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,740
Make sure she agrees and then get her prepped.

460
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,340
Why me?

461
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm not famous, I don't know anything about medicine,

462
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,030
and giving the keynote speech at your fundraiser

463
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,990
is a steep price to pay for a beer-stained jacket.

464
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,950
You grew up in San Jose.

465
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,430
You went to San Jose State

466
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,100
despite being accepted by both Princeton and MIT,

467
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,090
and you headquartered your company here,

468
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,430
despite huge tax breaks offered by Chicago and Minneapolis.

469
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,800
And it was his favorite jacket.

470
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,990
Well, when I offered to have it cleaned,

471
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,490
he said not to bother because he didn't even like the jacket.

472
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,560
- He was being polite. ‭- Polite?

473
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,850
I take it you've never been to a game with him.

474
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,890
You did some homework, but not enough.

475
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,960
I love this city, but I hate giving speeches.

476
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,250
So don't give a speech.

477
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,020
Tell us a story.

478
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,680
Like the one you told at the wrap party

479
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,360
at the Youth Dance company's fall musical --

480
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,050
the one where you got lost at the Paris catacombs.

481
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,310
I stand corrected.

482
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,800
Your success is inspiring, Aiden,

483
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,510
as well as your loyalty to this city.

484
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,920
And the fact that you're young, apparently very funny --

485
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,890
I'm in.

486
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,260
Actually, I was in as soon as Aaron told me

487
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,180
what you wanted to meet about.

488
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,310
But I was curious what your attack strategy would be.

489
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,780
So, how was it?

490
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,270
It was very effective.

492
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,330
Now, don't worry.

493
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,330
He's been a model inmate for nine years

494
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,040
and tutors the other prisoners in the library.

495
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,140
Coke nail come in handy up at Pelican Bay?

496
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,460
I make jewelry.

497
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,480
Helps me pick up the beads.

498
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,910
Is there a history of cancer or liver disease in your family?

499
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,510
I went through this a couple of months ago.

500
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,110
You have my file.

501
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,600
We need to do our own exam.

502
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,100
And there's nothing about your family in previous records.

503
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,370
Are they still alive?

504
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,480
They're dead to me.

505
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,110
Quit stalling, or we'll send you back right now.

506
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,450
I haven't spoken to anyone in my family since I was 15 years old.

507
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,170
Last I know, uh, both my parents were healthy enough

508
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,420
to kick the crap out of me on a daily basis.

509
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,960
Any other questions?

510
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,590
Why do you want to do this?

511
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,700
Maybe I just like, uh, cute nurses and bad Jell-o.

512
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,670
- Why do you care? - We don't.

513
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,580
As long as you do what you're told.

514
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,740
Don't worry.

515
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,810
I'm very good at following orders.

516
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,920
Councilman Burns must be very happy with his facelift.

517
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,130
He just bought another table for the fundraiser.

518
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,100
I aim to please, but you already knew that.

519
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,220
And I need to get into surgery, so stop being so coy.

520
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,280
What's up?

521
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,890
You and Isabel always seem very happy,

522
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,620
able to manage both your professional and personal lives.

523
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,790
I'm flattered you think so, but still a bit coy.

524
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,800
When I met with Aiden Coulter about being our keynote,

525
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,180
I thought there was a spark.

526
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,560
Okay, so now we're getting somewhere.

527
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,500
Surgery can wait a few minutes.

528
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:37,260
Is it...unprofessional of me to explore it?

529
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,730
He's not a hospital employee,

530
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,100
but potentially a significant donor and...

531
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,800
younger.

532
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,850
Quite a bit.

533
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,840
I don't know, maybe I'm just

534
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,940
imagining something that doesn't even exist.

535
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,870
I doubt that.

536
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,080
You're an attractive, smart, interesting woman.

537
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,870
I'm sure there was a spark.

538
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,240
But you can't date a donor like Coulter.

539
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,330
Sorry.

540
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,120
There's no actual policy against it.

541
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,670
I'm not talking policy, I'm talking optics.

542
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,630
The last thing you want is someone thinking

543
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,300
you'd use sex to get a big donation.

544
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,110
It's a double standard, I know,

545
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,330
but it's the world we live in.

546
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,230
I said no! I don't want it!

547
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,640
I thought you gave him something to calm him.

548
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,090
We did, but he's too agitated.

549
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,920
I'm gonna start him on IV midazolam now.

550
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,380
Eric -- Eric,

551
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,420
remember what Dr. Park said earlier about focusing?

552
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,790
I know you can do that.

553
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,640
How about we get those earbuds you had earlier?

554
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,490
No! Leave me alone!

555
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,100
Eric! Stop it.

556
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,010
Look at me!

557
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,820
Do not move.

558
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,560
You wear very stylish clothes.

559
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:58,560
Thank you.

560
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,930
I assume you mean when I'm not in surgery.

561
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,340
Yes. Do you think people believe you're a better doctor

562
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,540
because of that?

563
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,990
Some people.

564
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,830
Others probably just think

565
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,050
I'm a show-off or arrogant, gay.

566
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,220
I don't care. I do it for myself.

567
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,860
You look good, you feel good.

568
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,060
Does it help you make friends?

569
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,730
Feeling good about yourself helps with everything.

570
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,380
Do you know where I can buy a stylish tuxedo?

571
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,010
I can pay $2,000.

572
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,080
Okay.

573
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,140
Dr. Reznick says

574
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,600
if I want people who matter to help my career,

575
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,040
I need to wear a tuxedo that costs $2,000 to the fundraiser.

576
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,740
Have you talked to Glassman about this?

577
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:44,940
No. I make my own decisions now.

578
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,180
Murphy, people who matter will help your career

579
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,900
because they're impressed with your talent

580
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,650
and potential as a surgeon.

581
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,590
And I could send you to my tailor,

582
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,820
where you'll definitely spend two grand.

583
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,060
But my advice would be just rent one.

584
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,710
Make sure you get fitted by the manager,

585
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,780
and for a couple-hundred bucks, you'll be fine.

586
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,450
I'm gonna need you to count backwards from 10.

587
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,220
Ten, nine, eight...

588
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,240
Looks like you were wrong.

589
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,350
I said he'll do anything to convince us to trust him,

590
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,870
to let our guard down.

591
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,740
His eyes, they're swelling up.

592
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,970
So is his tongue. He's having an allergic reaction.

593
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:44,180
Stop the anaesthesia.

594
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,880
Give me 0.5 MGs epinephrine I.M. Now.

595
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,680
I'm on it.

596
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,150
- Epi's in. - He's hypoxic.

597
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,670
We need to intubate. Getting a 5.0 tube.

598
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,410
Now!

599
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,860
You had a severe allergic reaction to the anaesthesia.

600
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,230
We had to intubate you and give you steroids.

601
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,300
You didn't do it?

602
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,410
We can't operate on you

603
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,360
if you can't breathe under anaesthesia.

604
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,760
You did everything you could.

605
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,600
The patient's parents wanted you to know

606
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,410
they're extremely grateful for everything you did.

607
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,590
Or tried to do.

608
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,630
You can try again.

609
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,100
I'm sorry, we can't.

610
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,890
No, you try again.

611
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,960
Okay? Try again?

612
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,230
You try again.

613
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,940
Try again!

614
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,990
Try again!

615
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,620
Calm down!

616
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,700
Try again! Try again!

617
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,430
He said calm down! Now!

618
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,240
Same old, same old, yeah?

619
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,470
That's the way it's always been for me.

620
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,930
Nothing I ever...

621
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,760
He's still on the top of the UNOS list,

622
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,110
and we're gonna be calling and rechecking

623
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,350
every registry and database all night.

624
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,760
How long do we have?

625
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,730
Without a new liver, maybe a day.

626
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,570
So, what'd you get -- Hugo Boss? Armani?

627
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,980
Dr. Andrews said I should just rent one.

628
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,190
And you're gonna listen to him?

629
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,360
He's the Chief of Surgery. And he knows about clothes.

630
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,520
If Andrews had a son, you think he'd let him

631
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,830
go to an important event in a cheap rental tux?

632
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,540
He said people who matter judge people based on their talent.

633
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,870
Yeah, that's what he tells someone else's kid.

634
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:19,400
To his own, or someone he actually respects, he tells the truth.

635
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,400
Cut here.

636
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,040
Do you respect me?

637
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,370
You're smart, able to memorize a ton of information, but...

638
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,140
no, not really.

639
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,560
Suction the mediastinum.

640
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,290
You've certainly put a lot of thought

641
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,280
into what someone you claim not to respect wears to a party.

642
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,860
Just because I don't respect him doesn't mean I don't like him.

643
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,130
Everyone's uncomfortable in fancy clothes

644
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,330
and hates kissing up to bigwigs at a fundraiser.

645
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,780
But they do it. They don't cower at home alone.

646
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,810
You use your autism as a crutch.

647
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,790
Okay, I think if you liked him any more, he'd have a black eye.

648
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,940
Make sure we're clear on that side and the aorta isn't kinked.

649
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,140
- The aorta isn't kinked. - Good.

650
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,590
Now for the moment of truth.

651
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,550
Position the plate.

652
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,810
Perfect fit.

653
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:43,920
What the hell?

654
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,580
What'd you do?

655
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,270
I don't feel nothing.

656
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,370
No, don't touch him.

657
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,320
If he can't control his bladder...

658
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,920
He can control himself just fine.

659
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,350
Nice try, but the vacation's over.

660
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,130
Stand up.

661
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,570
Re-check his cuffs first.

662
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,450
You're getting changed, and we're going.

663
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,940
Just take him like he is.

664
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,260
I'm not gonna get stuck in the van

665
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,550
for the next three hours with him like that.

666
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,730
Watch his hands! Watch his hands!

667
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,260
Put the gun down now!

668
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,710
You shoot me, he dies.

669
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,120
Now, no one is shooting anyone.

670
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,690
Everyone stay calm.

671
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,260
Give him space.

672
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,030
You did something good, Boris.

673
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,680
Don't ruin it now.

674
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,870
I did nothing, yeah?

675
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,200
I accomplished nothing!

676
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,570
Whatever happens next is completely in your control.

677
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:36,780
You have power, but it's not unlimited.

678
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,410
You're not gonna escape,

679
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,230
you're not just walking out of here.

680
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,020
But there are things, concessions,

681
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,650
that could make your life better.

682
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,350
So let's just take our time and talk.

683
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,260
There's no rush.

684
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,470
What do you want, Boris?

685
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,120
What do you really want?

686
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,900
I don't want anyone to help me.

687
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,620
Whatever you call it, these life-saving measures.

688
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,120
I -- No.

689
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,820
No.

690
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,380
Do not do it.

691
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,230
Don't listen to her. It's your choice.

692
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,690
You do what you want.

693
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,350
Yeah.

694
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,700
Boris, no!

695
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,700
Let's go! Let's go! Move! Move!

696
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,340
Melendez is en route.

697
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,580
All right, ready? Let's go.

698
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,120
Three, two, one.

699
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,390
Page urology and cardio-thoracic stat.

700
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,460
He's dead and he has a donor card.

701
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,290
We're gonna take everything he can donate.

What's happening? Did you find a new liver donor?

727
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,580
Actually, it's -- it's the same one.

728
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,570
The circumstances have changed.

729
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,710
This is incredible.

730
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,440
No, I don't want it.

731
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,590
Eric, when the donor found out

732
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,420
that he couldn't do the surgery to help you,

733
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,860
he became incredibly sad

734
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,570
because he wanted you to live more than he wanted to live.

735
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:43,020
He ended his life so that you could have his liver.

736
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,800
He -- He knew he'd done some bad things,

737
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,650
and I think that this was the only way he knew how to make amends.

738
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,390
I think we should try and help him.

739
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,880
Do you think you can do that --

740
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,600
help someone do something good?

741
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,500
Yeah.

742
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,470
Everything looks good good.

743
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,200
Remember to take deep breaths

744
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,660
so you don't develop any lung complications,

745
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,870
and, obviously, avoid lifting anything too heavy

No, it cost $2,368.

Well, it was worth every penny.

769
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,440
Well, okay. They have other choices.

770
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,000
A glass of wine or a soda?

771
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,050
No, thank you.

772
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:00,690

She runs the Rivington Fellowship at the Mayo Clinic.

795
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,880
I wonder who brought her here.

796
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,690
I don't know.

797

You still think people can't change?

799
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,130
He didn't.

800
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,270
He's an assassin who murdered people for money.

801
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,410
Today was just one more cold-blooded killing.

802
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,590
You helped him sacrifice his life

803
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,710
so that he could save someone else.

804
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,480
I am not a fan of what you did,

805
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,160
even if it did prove --

806
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,950
He didn't sacrifice anything.

807
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,640
He died a long time ago.

808
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,280
His crew is probably gone.

809
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,640
In prison, he was a nobody.

810
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,330
And now? He lives on as a hero

811
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,090
to Eric's family, to the press, to you.

812
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,420
Jaundice is improving.

813
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,200
Edema's resolving, too.

814
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,820
His vitals look good.

815
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,400
It's been great night.

816
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,780
Three other lives were saved, as well.

817
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,620
Does his parents know what he did?

818
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,360
I want to send them a card.

819
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,670
I know they're gonna be sad, but...

820
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,340
I want to tell them I'll take good care of their son's liver.

821
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,900

00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,390
Yes, it cost --

931
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,930
Well, whatever you paid for it, it was worth.

Same as always.
