00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:10,581
I can put a detail on her.

179
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,898
You didn't see this guy, Joe.

180
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,117
No offense, but I don't think a cop

181
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,835
is going to be able to protect her.

182
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:18,172
No, but we do have a few
friends who could lend a hand.

183
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:19,739
But we're going to need
to leave Central City.

184
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,409
And go where?

185
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,344
You really want to go to Star City?

186
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,296
Come on, we don't need Team Arrow's help.

187
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,015
Yeah, I think we do, man.

188
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,633
Man, you've fought
meta-humans with abilities

189
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,301
a lot worse than knife-throwing.

190
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,770
I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

191
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:35,088
There's something different about him,

192
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,524
something, ah, mystical.

193
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,226
Mystical, really?

194
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,061
We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

195
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,980
We can figure out what
their weaknesses are,

196
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,599
but we don't have any experience
when it comes to guys like this,

197
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,401
with magic.

198
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,452
They do.

199
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:49,570
Mm, this wouldn't have

200
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,038
anything to do with Zoom, would it?

201
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,372
No.

202
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:53,607
I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe.

203
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:54,992
This is the best way to do that.

204
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,960
Right. Okay, I'm with you.

205
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,213
But how do we even know Oliver and them

206
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:00,914
even have time to help us?

207
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,382
How busy can they be?

208
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:04,835
[gasping]

209
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:08,455
[gasping mockingly]

210
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:10,174
Oh, gosh, that's fun.

211
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:12,092
I really could do this all day.

212
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,062
Open it up.

213
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,631
They could've at least tried
to hide this chemical bomb.

214
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:20,901
Serves them right, it getting
stolen and used against them.

215
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:27,107
Oh, you brought arrows to a gunfight.

216
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,942
What guns?

217
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,532
Oh, that was actually pretty clever.

218
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,584
Kill them.

219
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,512
"Felicity, the magnetic-arrow
gag will never work."

220
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:50,830
[chuckles] Yes, it will, my love,

221
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:53,100
because I am really smart.

222
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:55,302
And guess what, Oliver. It did work.

223
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,221
<i>Felicity, honey, it's a
little hard to fight</i>

224
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,772
<i>with you doing that in my ear.</i>

225
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,774
Oh, I totally forgot that
this was an open line.

226
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:03,110
Keep doing what you're
doing. Make smart decisions.

227
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:06,029
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

228
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,668
Ooh! You know, I got to be honest.

229
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,138
I really thought we'd be
doing this dance a lot longer.

230
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
Night-night.

231
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:40,013
[laughs]

232
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,715
What was that?

233
00:10:43,902 --> 00:10:45,152
[vomits]

234
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:46,520
Damn it.

235
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,155
Every time.

236
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:50,107
It's The Flash.

237
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,609
Did I know we knew The Flash?

238
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,661
We know The Flash. Okay.

239
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,663
- I didn't know we knew The Flash.
- Thank you.

240
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:59,032
But I don't think you ran all
the way here to protect us.

241
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,568
No, not to protect you.

242
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,921
I need to protect a friend.

243
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,227
Wow.

244
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:15,230
Nice new digs.

245
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,899
Also, I just noticed, no sleeves.

246
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:18,434
Don't you get cold?

247
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:20,169
I spent the better part
of five years on an island

248
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:21,420
in the North China Sea.

249
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:22,788
I don't get cold, Barry.

250
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,906
Barry, it's so good to see you.

251
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:26,875
Felicity.

252
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:28,610
Good to see you, Felicity.

253
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:30,345
How come you didn't tell
me Zoom broke your back?

254
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:33,715
- I...
- Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

255
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:35,050
So this is what it's like dating her?

256
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,252
More bruises from her
than from Deathstroke.

257
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:41,306
Okay, S.T.A.R. Labs is
impressive, but this is...

258
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:44,026
This is completely wrong!

259
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:46,311
Did you guys even look
at the specs I sent over?

260
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:47,863
This is a tragedy.

261
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,865
I'm mourning for the death of engineering.

262
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:52,734
Copper wiring to handle
the processing speed

263
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,036
from the Palmer Satellite,

264
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:56,438
or else your system is gonna overload.

265
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,939
Yeah, but that hasn't happened.

266
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,458
I mean, it hasn't happened since last week.

267
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,993
I mean, it didn't... It happened yesterday.

268
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:02,494
- Hi.
- I'm Felicity.

269
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:06,882
I'm Kendra Saunders. I'm Cisco's...

270
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:10,219
She's, uh, my, uh, new, beautiful friend

271
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:13,305
who kisses me occasionally.

272
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:17,593
Right. Um, I'm Thea.

273
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:19,928
This is John Diggle and my brother.

274
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,979
Oliver Queen.

275
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:22,397
- Yeah, I know.
- Hi.

276
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,149
Wow. Okay, first to meet The Flash

277
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:26,685
and now the Green Arrow.

278
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,070
Do you have any other surprises for me?

279
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:30,822
[chuckles] Please, no more surprises.

280
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:32,641
Barry said that you need our help.

281
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:34,693
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

282
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:37,329
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

283
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,314
What does this guy even look like?

284
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,483
Hold on.

285
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,090
Okay, this is him.

286
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah, see, that's something
I would never think of.

287
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:52,844
Hey, kind of rocking
that Dothraki look... hot.

288
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,846
Let's see if facial
recognition can find a match.

289
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:58,433
[keys clacking, computer beeping]

290
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:04,022
- That's him.
- Yeah, strange.

291
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,108
This picture's from 1975.

292
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,110
Which would make him about
80 years old right now.

293
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:10,696
Okay, what else can you tell us?

294
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,481
He said we've known each other for ages,

295
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,366
but I've never met the man before.

296
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:16,318
There has to be some kind of connection.

297
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,036
Not one I can think of.

298
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:20,706
I just moved to Central
City six months ago.

299
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,124
Why'd you move there?

300
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:24,793
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

301
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:27,028
Kendra, there is a reason
this guy's after you.

302
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,630
Think.

303
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:30,666
Look, man, we just came out
here to hide out for a bit

304
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:33,252
until we figure things out,
so you can just take it down...

305
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:34,586
You came here because you need our help.

306
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:36,305
This is what my help looks like.

307
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:38,257
Oliver, I just saved you
guys from whatever the hell

308
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,508
Flock of Seagulls was about to do.

309
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,709
The least you can do is...

310
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:42,477
Barry, none of us have superpowers.

311
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,146
You brought Kendra into our world

312
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,597
without knowing who she is

313
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,882
or what this dude that is
after her is looking for.

314
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:49,818
You made all of us unsafe.

315
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,320
So maybe you ask the questions.

316
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:54,439
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

317
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:57,159
- We're all friends here, right?
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,360
Why don't we go back to our place

319
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,495
and have some drinks, and we can talk?

320
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:01,947
Cool.

321
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:05,066
What you working on?

322
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,252
This is a formula

323
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:10,038
meant to increase a speedster's velocity

324
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,072
that I've been developing

325
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,342
since Zoom showed up on my Earth.

326
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:16,628
Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

327
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,764
You want to give Barry a
drug to make him run faster?

328
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,717
Temporarily enhance the Speed
Force in his system, yes.

329
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:24,102
So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

330
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,554
Good analogy. Yes, I tried.

331
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:27,389
Five times I tried. Five times I failed.

332
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,358
That's what you get when
your background is technology

333
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,525
and not biochemistry.

334
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,394
Well, then you are lucky I am here.

335
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:33,595
What does that mean?

336
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:34,929
You've been thinking of this

337
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:37,232
as a mechanical problem,
not a biomechanical one.

338
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,483
And what does that mean?

339
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:40,068
When a speedster runs, they consume

340
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,287
an extraordinary amount of oxygen,

341
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,156
so we just need something
to give an extra boost

342
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:45,407
of oxygen during that time.

343
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,075
Like an oxygen generator.

344
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:48,126
Exactly.

345
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,745
So we just need a chemical

346
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:52,280
that's rich in oxygen that would release it

347
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:55,083
as a nearly pure gas as it decomposes...

348
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:56,218
Something like...

349
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,803
Both: Sodium chlorate.

350
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:00,339
Then all we'd need is
heat to release the oxygen.

351
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:02,174
Which a speedster generates naturally

352
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:04,726
in the form of lightning.

353
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,478
I think something like
this just might work.

354
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,230
You think you can help me figure it out?

355
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:10,465
I can certainly try.

356
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:13,134
I'm not changing my nickname.

357
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,486
I like Speedy.

358
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:16,154
Are you familiar with my body of work?

359
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,407
If you are, then you know
I can come up with something

360
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:20,692
so much better than Speedy.

361
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:23,245
Why don't you get a haircut?

362
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:25,080
And then maybe we can talk about it.

363
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:26,748
I think you're just mad
because my conditioner game

364
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,999
is on point.

365
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,752
So the CEO of Palmer Technologies

366
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:32,537
is living with Oliver Queen.

367
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:35,040
It's insane how much life
can change in six months, huh?

368
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,708
Which you would know better than anyone,

369
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,660
considering that there's another Flash,

370
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:42,297
another Dr. Wells, from another... earth.

371
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:43,632
I mean...

372
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:45,667
Yeah. No, it's been trippy lately.

373
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,269
I wonder what Oliver's
doppelganger would look like.

374
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:51,005
- Bald, pot-bellied...
- Uh-huh.

375
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:55,343
- Agreeable.
- [laughs]

376
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:56,445
You seeing anyone?

377
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:58,697
- I am, actually.
- Good.

378
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,115
Patty is her name.

379
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,616
She's amazing.

380
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,518
You deserve someone amazing.

381
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,519
Thanks.

382
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,620
[oven timer dings]

383
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:08,240
[gasps] My pigs in a blanket!

384
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:10,375
Hey, Ollie, um...

385
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:13,328
look, I'm sorry that I
laid all of this on you.

386
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,130
- I know that it wasn't fair.
- [sighs] It's okay.

387
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:16,865
I'm sorry if earlier I was a little...

388
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,500
Snippy?

389
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:19,918
I have been called worse.

390
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,169
No, but I'm glad that you're here.

391
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:22,537
I'm glad you reached out.

392
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:24,473
It shows a real maturity,
and I would know that

393
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:26,308
because I've never been that mature.

394
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,726
[laughs]

395
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,311
I'm always here for you.

396
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,645
Thank you.

397
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:32,647
I got to say, this isn't the same

398
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:34,215
Arrow team I'm used to seeing

399
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,017
or the same Oliver Queen.

400
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,436
- You seem really...
- Happy?

401
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:39,738
- Happy, yeah.
- I am happy.

402
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,656
I finally have everything
that I've ever wanted.

403
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:46,278
Being with Felicity has given
me a real sense of peace,

404
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,330
something that I haven't
had in a long time.

405
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:51,232
Didn't you tell me that guys
like us don't get the girl?

406
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,751
Yep.

407
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:54,202
I was wrong.

408
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:55,837
[laughs]

409
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,707
I would like to propose a toast.

410
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,544
I wish it wasn't just the dark
times bringing us together.

411
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,413
But it is friends like you

412
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,933
that make those dark times worth having.

413
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,184
[chuckles] What a guy.

414
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:10,886
Steals my drinks, steals my words.

415
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,971
As I was saying, it's good to see everyone.

416
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:14,055
- Yes.
- Cheers.

417
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:14,973
Cheers.

418
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,608
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

419
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,527
- [clears throat]
- Mm.

420
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:21,813
Look, don't worry, all right?

421
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:22,864
We're gonna keep her safe.

422
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,866
- I promise.
- Yeah, I know.

423
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,402
Look, there's something I never told you.

424
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:30,772
The first time I kissed
Kendra, I got a vibe.

425
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:32,240
No, not like that kind of vibe.

426
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:34,459
- Like, I<i> vibed</i> vibed.
- Oh.

427
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,127
Remember the man with wings?

428
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:37,412
It wasn't a man.

429
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:39,080
It was Kendra.

430
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:41,082
She was, like, a bird.

431
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:42,634
You think that she's a meta-human?

432
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:44,452
Mm...

433
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,171
Wait. Why didn't you say
anything about this sooner?

434
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:47,422
Well, I didn't think it was related,

435
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:50,141
but I guess now it has to be.

436
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:54,796
Look, I don't want her
to know about my powers.

437
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,132
I have this great thing going with her.

438
00:17:58,134 --> 00:18:01,570
She laughs at my jokes,
and she loves movies,

439
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:03,772
and...

440
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,991
I just... I've never felt like this before,

441
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:09,310
and I don't want to sabotage it.

442
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:10,745
I get the feeling.

443
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:13,164
[gasps] Look!

444
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,673
I will always find you, Chay-Ara.

445
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:27,379
- Don't move.
- Then how will I kill you all?

446
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:30,348
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

447
00:18:43,846 --> 00:18:45,697
[grunts]

448
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:01,496
Yeah, I can do that too.

449
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:15,060
Thea, no!

450
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:23,685
What did you do?

451
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:25,553
I ended it.

452
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:30,058
This is why we ask questions.

453
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,332
Wait. W-where did he go?

454
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:41,620
Both: Oh, boy.

455
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,804
[sighs]

456
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:51,276
Okay.

457
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,361
Thanks.

458
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:57,348
All right, Lance is gonna call
if he gets any information on...

459
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,534
whoever that is.

460
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,820
I know where we can get some info.

461
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,694
Kendra, I have powers.

462
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:13,865
I get these vibes from people.

463
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:17,302
They're visions of meta-humans,

464
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,037
and I had one of you.

465
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,557
So, A, you're saying you're a meta-human,

466
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,225
and, B, she's a meta-human?

467
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:25,644
I don't know.

468
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:29,097
In these visions, you could fly.

469
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,817
It was like you were a bird of some sort.

470
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:35,320
- A bird?
- Yeah.

471
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:36,738
What else did you see?

472
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,525
That's it... just you with wings.

473
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,411
Oh, I did not see that one coming.

474
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,836
Oh, I think there's a
lot you didn't see coming.

475
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:54,572
- Great. More surprises.
- Who the hell is this?

476
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:56,174
It's my dad.

477
00:20:58,711 --> 00:21:01,913
[computer beeping rapidly]

478
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:07,552
I think I did it.

479
00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:13,191
What do you know, Snow?

480
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:15,026
I think you did do it.

481
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:20,598
- Velocity-6?
- Ah.

482
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,283
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?

483
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:25,403
You get me to come here so
I can take your speed drug?

484
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:26,705
That's right.

485
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:28,623
- You knew about this.
- Of course she did.

486
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,909
She figured it out.

487
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:32,944
I thought this was to help Barry.

488
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,546
It is to help Barry, which is why we need

489
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:35,880
to do test runs on subjects

490
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:38,083
who once had the Speed
Force in their system.

491
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:39,951
The Speed Force doesn't work like that.

492
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:42,721
It's not something you can create in a lab.

493
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:44,806
How do you think you
became The Flash, Garrick?

494
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:46,257
By me and a lab.

495
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,394
Science is what did this
to you, to Barry, to Zoom,

496
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:51,229
and science is what we need to stop Zoom,

497
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:52,230
and this is our only option.

498
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:53,865
Find another one.

499
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,567
The Speed Force can't be
replicated or enhanced.

500
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:56,851
It's a living thing.

501
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:58,570
It's a gift that was given to me.

502
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:00,355
That drug... you have no
idea what it's gonna do.

503
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:01,823
I'm not going to let another
one of your experiments

504
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:03,324
mess with me again, Harrison.

505
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:05,076
You find someone else
to be your guinea pig.

506
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:06,528
Jay.

507
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,415
Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.

508
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,283
- Where are you going?
- To pick up what we need.

509
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:14,485
Wait. Jay just said we
shouldn't give it to Barry.

510
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:17,655
We're gonna do what we need.

511
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,711
The man you're looking
for is Vandal Savage.

512
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:24,763
Vandal Savage? Never heard of him.

513
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:26,431
Well, who is he?

514
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,383
Some say he was the most
trusted adviser to Genghis Khan.

515
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:29,684
Others say he guided Julius Caesar

516
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:31,052
through the Gallic Wars.

517
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:34,639
But one thing the League knows for sure...

518
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:35,840
He was there for all of it.

519
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:37,192
So what are you saying?

520
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:38,476
He's like a vampire or something?

521
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:41,396
Not a vampire, an Immortal.

522
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:43,481
Okay, we've officially
stepped into crazy town.

523
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:44,732
Immortality?

524
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,451
Wait. No, no, no, this makes sense.

525
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:50,371
This explains why he looks
the same as he did in 1975.

526
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:51,906
This can't be possible.

527
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:55,710
There's nothing you can do to save her now.

528
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:57,862
Kendra, do not listen to him.

529
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:00,465
I... I just need some air.

530
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:07,555
Hey, we're gonna do

531
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:09,307
whatever we have to to keep Kendra safe,

532
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,176
whether you think we can or not.

533
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:12,760
Hey, Joe, it's Patty.

534
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:14,846
I just interviewed a weapons
expert about the flint knife

535
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:16,214
our attacker used.

536
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:18,266
Found out something pretty interesting,

537
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:20,185
uh, so call me back.

538
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:27,325
Harrison Wells?

539
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,693
Kendra!

540
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:32,247
Hey, you going to be all right?

541
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:34,165
It's just a lot to take in right now.

542
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,234
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about me before.

543
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:39,403
I didn't want things to
be different between us.

544
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:40,922
It's not that, Cisco.

545
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:42,790
If what everyone's saying is true...

546
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,509
And it's beginning to seem like it is...

547
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:47,378
My whole life just changed,

548
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,297
and I am so not ready for that.

549
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,383
I hear what you're saying. I do.

550
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:57,188
When I first learned about my powers,

551
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,141
I remember feeling that exact same feeling,

552
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:02,093
and sometimes I still feel that way,

553
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:05,429
and all I can say is...

554
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:10,285
every day gets a little bit more normal.

555
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:13,204
I promise you.

556
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,792
Thank you.

557
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:19,244
You're so welcome.

- You need to wake up.
- What are you talking about?

571
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,632
I don't know who you are.

572
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,351
You will once you emerge.

00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,189
Protect me? From what?

576
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:26,860
The man who's hunting you, Vandal Savage.

577
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,695
I got them! 57th Street tower.

578

I'm right near there.

Always a pleasure watching you work, Smoak.

Yeah!

581
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:34,784
- Ow.
- That was pitiful.

582
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:36,452
I know this is a lot to take in,

583
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:38,454
but you sort of just kind
of have to trust me on this.

584
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:39,856

00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:53,186
I got eyes on him.

00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:11,120
- Give me the girl.
- Not gonna do that, Robin Hood.

00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:13,990
- You're making a big mistake.
- I'll take my chances.

590
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,994
Barry, change of venue.

591
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:20,529
Birdman and Oliver are at
54th and Motor now... hurry!

We can't use that serum on Barry.

Well, Jay's a coward.

00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,899
Jay's a scientist who knows
a lot about speedsters.

- You're a scientist, Snow.
- You've been watching Barry.

You know, you're really starting to sound

610
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,828
a lot like him.

611

- Christina McGee?

616
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,676
You're Harrison Wells.

617
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:31,928
Yes, I'm Harrison Wells.

618
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,162
- I'm not the Harrison...
- Stop!

Stay with me, Harrison, come on.

626
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,320
- Why did you shoot him?
- I thought that was a gun.

627
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:03,822
- I'm sorry. I'll call 911.
- No, don't!

628
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:05,457
- Why?
- Because this...

629
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,008
Didn't Joe West explain this to you?

630
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,676
- No.
- Just call Joe.

631
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:10,728
Okay.

632
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:25,660
Where is she?

633
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:26,861
What's your name?

634
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:28,413
You're putting her in danger,

635
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:29,864
and I'm the only one capable of saving her.

636
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:31,649
You have a very interesting perspective

637
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,368
on what the word "saving" means.

638
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,036
She's the love of my lifetime, sweetheart.

639
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,422
I was not gonna hurt her.

640
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:39,624
You need to let me go.

641
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:45,296
Chay-Ara.

642
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:47,498
My name is Kendra Saunders.

643
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,883
In this life.

644
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:51,135
And I am... was Carter Hall,

645
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,170
but that is not who we are.

646
00:29:53,172 --> 00:29:54,973
What does that mean?

647
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:57,609
You're Priestess
Chay-Ara. I'm Prince Khufu.

648
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,143
And we're lovers.

649
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,562
Soul mates.

650
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:03,147
We've been partners for 4,000 years.

651
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:04,899
We're drawn to each other in
each life, and after we die,

652
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,952
we reincarnate to find each
other again and again and again.

653
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:10,705
And now that I've found you, we
should really get out of here.

654
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:13,374
Okay, Romeo, why don't you pump the brakes?

655
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:16,211
These people cannot protect
you from Savage any longer.

656
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:19,714
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

657
00:30:19,716 --> 00:30:23,751
In every lifetime, he
hunts us down and kills us.

658
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:25,870
He's done it 206 times,

659
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:27,805
and I'm not planning to make it 207.

660
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,591
Why does he kill you?

661
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:32,810
His life force is tethered to ours.

662
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:34,512
Every time he kills us,
he becomes more powerful.

663
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:35,647
You do the math.

664
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:37,181
You're 0 for 206,

665
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:39,484
and you still think
you're her best bet, hmm?

666
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:41,986
Okay, so what we need
to do is just find Savage

667
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:43,855
and get rid of him.

668
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:46,441
Well, you can't get rid of him, my friend.

669
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:49,077
Oh, yeah? Watch us.

670
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,945
It might be harder than you think.

671
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:54,198
Is that the only way this
guy knows how to enter a room?

672
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,335
My associates tell me Savage
left Star City a few hours ago.

673
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:58,953
- For where?
- We're not quite sure.

674
00:30:58,955 --> 00:31:00,538
But I assume after his run-in with you,

675
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,740
he realized he needed
something more powerful

676
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:04,876
to complete his mission.

677
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:07,629
We think he's trying to
locate the Staff of Horus.

678
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,580
Sorry, what is that?

679
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:11,248
It's a relic from our past...

680
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,636
An ancient and powerful weapon.

681
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:16,554
If Savage gets his hands on it,

682
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:18,523
it's going to be nearly
impossible to stop him.

683
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:20,224
Since when did our lives suddenly become

684
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:21,943
an "Indiana Jones" movie?

685
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:23,260
- Felicity?
- Yeah?

686
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,729
- Think you can find it?
- Yeah.

687
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:26,263
It's probably at some museum somewhere.

688
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:29,567
I'll, uh, work my magic,
see what I can find.

689
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:31,953
We're running out of time.

690
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:34,539
You need to emerge now.

691
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,991
Come on, what is it gonna
take for you to believe me?

692
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,576
You saw my wings.

693
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:40,945
I know you know this is true.

694
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:43,114
Please, just let me show you how.

695
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,140
- How's he doing?
- He's losing oxygen.

696
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:53,624
- I need you to leave.
- Joe, I...

697
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:56,511
Patty, go.

698
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:58,479
There's a bullet in a branch
of his pulmonary artery

699
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:01,432
that's blocking off most of the
blood flow from the left lung.

700
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:02,767
Are we able to get the bullet out?

701
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,435
Not without causing too much damage.

702
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:05,987
I need Jay's help.

703
00:32:15,447 --> 00:32:17,665
[wind whistling]

704
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:20,385
So...

705
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:23,454
you just want me to jump.

706
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:25,757
Fall, jump, swan dive, whatever suits you.

707
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,675

00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:02,296
Your serum's out of my system,

888
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:05,600
and I will never take it again.

889
00:41:10,556 --> 00:41:14,142
Jay...

890
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:15,893
thank you.

891
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:20,114
You can thank me by keeping
that Velocity-6 away from Barry.

892
00:41:29,374 --> 00:41:30,875
That was Oliver.

893
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:32,410
Savage has the Staff of Horus.

894
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:35,129
He wants us all in Central
City as soon as possible.

895
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:37,331
Okay, well, Laurel's already
there visiting her mom,

896
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,217
so I'll call her and let
her know we're coming by.

897
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:40,951
If Savage is in Central City,

898
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:42,587
then why are we going back there?

899
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:44,005
So we can end this.

900
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,306
And if anybody's gonna take down Savage,

901
00:41:45,308 --> 00:41:46,424
it's going to be Barry and Oliver.

902
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:47,809
Plus, you've emerged.

903
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:48,793
It's going to be much harder for him now.

904
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:50,144
And together, all of us,

905
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:51,629
we can take him down once and for all.

906
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:55,233
Okay, so how are we gonna get there?

907
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:56,567
Did I mention I'm the CEO

908
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:59,237
of a big company with a private jet?

910
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:11,649
Since when is that a thing?

911
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:13,951
About eight months.

912
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:17,205
Maybe if you save Star
City, you might get one too.

913
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:20,658
By the way, we still need to get Savage.

914
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,843
We'll get him.

915
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,597
Watch yourself, buddy.

916
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:31,803
You don't want to lose this guy.

917
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:33,337
- Thanks, Mister.
- Yeah.
