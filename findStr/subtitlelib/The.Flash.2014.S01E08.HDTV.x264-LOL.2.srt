1
00:00:01,576 --> 00:00:05,547
My name is Barry Allen, and
I'm the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:07,659
When I was a child, I saw my mother

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,927
killed by something impossible.

4
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:10,264
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:13,005
My father went to prison for her murder.

6
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:16,856
Then an accident made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,857 --> 00:00:18,156
To the outside world,

8
00:00:18,157 --> 00:00:19,591
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,592 --> 00:00:22,436
but secretly I use my speed to fight crime

10
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:24,003
and find others like me,

11
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:26,606
and one day I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:29,244
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,880
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,687
Previously, on The Flash and Arrow...

15
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:36,291
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

16
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,999
I don't know if I can be some vigilante.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,666
You can be better, because
you can inspire people

18
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,269
in a way that I never could.

19
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,275
You said you were writing
about me to bring hope

20
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:46,976
to someone you care about.

21
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:49,209
How would he feel if doing
that put you in harm's way?

22
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,047
You're giving hope to a lot of people.

23
00:00:51,048 --> 00:00:52,886
- So I'm doing this for them.
- Barry, when you met me,

24
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,354
Oliver, and Dig, we were this
well-oiled archery machine,

25
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:58,022
but it didn't start out that way.

26
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,889
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you tonight.

27
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,792
You're worth being on time for.

28
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:08,795
Everyone on this planet, at
some point in their lives,

29
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:10,998
has had a major case of the feels...

30
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:13,033
Those days when your
heart is just too small

31
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:17,306
to hold the big things you're feeling.

32
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,044
Today's one of those days.

33
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,917
We think of our emotions
like they're these unique,

34
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,887
personal phenomena,

35
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:28,389
that no one has ever
felt what we have felt.

36
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,658
There is a basis in science
for every emotion we feel...

37
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:33,527
Anger, love.

38
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:36,264
As a scientist, I know
there's nothing magical

39
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:39,402
about what makes us feel
something for someone else...

40
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:42,640
But then I see her smile.

41
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:45,208
Man, that cannot be science.

42
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,548
Oh, and there's a fresh
bottle in the fridge

43
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,785
when she wakes up from her nap.

44
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,986
Thank you.

45
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,860
Sir? Help you with something?

46
00:02:05,861 --> 00:02:08,463
Thanks.

47
00:02:08,464 --> 00:02:11,165
I'll be just fine on my own.

48
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,644
Sir, you're not allowed to be back here.

49
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,679
Nothing to get upset about.

50
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:43,060
Barry, bank robbery in progress

51
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:45,663
- at Cunningham and Sampere.
- I got it.

52
00:02:45,664 --> 00:02:47,131
Wait, that's where I bank.

53
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:50,503
Once super thieves showed
up, I went mattress.

54
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,108
I've already missed the gym.

55
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:30,009
Ugh, no. Five more minutes.

56
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,548
Come on, we never get to sleep in.

57
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,986
I know. But your dad hates tardiness.

58
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:39,928
Buzzkill.

59
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:43,266
The buzziest.

60
00:03:48,677 --> 00:03:50,978
Another picture of The Flash came in.

61
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,180
See?

62
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:54,524
That red blur?

63
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,286
How do you know that wasn't photoshopped?

64
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:57,621
It wasn't.

65
00:03:57,622 --> 00:04:01,289
It's not a hoax or a mass hallucination.

66
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,126
You know, every day, someone
new accepts the impossible

67
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:07,163
and believes in him.

68
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,966
Why can't you?

69
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:12,233
I believe in what I can see...

70
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:14,501
What I can touch...

71
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:17,403
What I can feel.

72
00:04:17,404 --> 00:04:21,141
- Which means I believe in you.
- Mm.

73
00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:27,381
Do you mind? Thanks, man.

74
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:29,552
- Hey.
- Busy morning.

75
00:04:29,553 --> 00:04:31,654
Witnesses reported seeing a red streak?

76
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:33,787
Joe, you should have seen it.
It was like everybody in here

77
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:35,993
was trying to kill each
other. I got here just in time.

78
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:37,624
Well, it must've been a diversion,

79
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,226
because there's 1/2 million
bucks missing from the vault.

80
00:04:40,227 --> 00:04:41,995
There's a tracer in the cash stacks.

81
00:04:41,996 --> 00:04:43,630
We're trying to find the signal.

82
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:47,869
Meantime, any idea what
could've caused such mass...

83
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,403
- This?
- A neurotoxin, maybe.

84
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:52,606
I'm going to swab some
surfaces, see what I can find,

85
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,812
but I think maybe they got whammied.

86
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:59,151
- Did you just say “whammied”?
- I got so angry.

87
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:02,790
I can't believe I did that.
I would never hurt anybody.

88
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,162
- You have to believe me.
- I do.

89
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:08,067
Something is happening in this city

90
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:10,406
and everyone wants to pretend
like it isn't, but it is,

91
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:12,206
and I think we should
do something about it.

92
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:15,000
My boyfriend has decided we
need to eat healthy at home,

93
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:19,129
so work is now the only
place I can eat what I like.

94
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,196
Oh, I'm sorry, were you
saying something, Detective?

95
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,564
The Blur, The Flash, the
man in the red suit...

96
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:26,568
Whatever he's called...
He was spotted at the bank

97
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,603
- this morning.
- You mean the bank

98
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:30,571
that was robbed of 1/2 million dollars,

99
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:32,875
where a dozen people
tried to murder each other,

100
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,845
and you think our attention
should be focused on

101
00:05:34,846 --> 00:05:37,445
- catching Santa Claus.
- I can't explain

102
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:40,349
how he gets to and from
crime scenes so fast.

103
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,252
We need to figure out who
this guy is and what he wants.

104
00:05:44,253 --> 00:05:46,187
You should ask your girlfriend.

105
00:05:46,188 --> 00:05:49,993
She writes fan fiction about him.

106
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:52,498
Joe, help me out here.

107
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:54,067
Sorry, partner.

108
00:05:54,068 --> 00:05:56,768
I stopped believing in
Santa when I was about eight.

109
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,614
Hey. What's going on in there?

110
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,049
I think Eddie's trying
to convince the Captain

111
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,355
that The Flash is a public menace.

112
00:06:09,356 --> 00:06:10,989
Excuse me?

113
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:14,791
So after weeks of my trying to convince you

114
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,458
that The Flash is real,

115
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,026
now that you finally do believe me,

116
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:19,662
you're trying to have him arrested?

117
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:20,898
- What the hell?
- Thanks, Barry.

118
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,235
Sorry.

119
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:25,272
No worries. The captain shot me down.

120
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:26,974
Look, I'm not feeling like lunch.

121
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:28,877
See you later.

122
00:06:32,315 --> 00:06:34,018
He's just jealous.

123
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,789
Of The Flash?

124
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,025
Should he be?

125
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:39,394
No.

126
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:42,364
I'll see you later.

127
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:43,633
Barry,

128
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:45,436
you need to get to S.T.A.R. Labs.

129
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,937
Yeah, I will. After I eat.

130
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:58,847
Anger, hate, aggression.

131
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:02,419
A Jedi craves not these things.

132
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,122
No one is feeling that quote?

133
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,157
Everyone in the bank went total savage for,

134
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,590
like, five minutes.

135
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:08,925
And then they were fine again.

136
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,130
Anger can be a powerful emotion.

137
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,664
If this meta-human can engender
irrational feelings of anger

138
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:15,734
in his victims, he can do a lot of damage.

139
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,771
Detective West helped get
a copy of the cat scans

140
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,938
the hospital did on everyone at the bank.

141
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,507
Take a look.

142
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:23,810
Well, look at this,

143
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,379
the emotion centers of the brains

144
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,783
are still showing signs
of being overwhelmed.

145
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:30,853
Particularly the area that
controls executive function.

146
00:07:30,854 --> 00:07:33,083
That's the part of the brain
that stops people from doing

147
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,111
whatever random and
potentially destructive thing

148
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:36,358
that pops into their head.

149
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:37,992
How do you think the meta does it to them?

150
00:07:37,993 --> 00:07:40,059
That's the 1/2 million dollar question.

151
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:45,960
Hey, if you guys figure it
out, just give me a call, okay?

152
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:48,863
Is The Flash off to another
rooftop rendezvous with Iris?

153
00:07:48,864 --> 00:07:51,033
No.

154
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:54,369
Yeah, but she probably
just wants to ask me...

155
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,442
I mean, you know, him... about
meta-human stuff for her blog.

156
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,244
Do you want some advice?

157
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,280
No matter what I say, I'm
getting the advice, right?

158
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,549
Don't get involved.

159
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,919
As The Flash or yourself.

160
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,557
You don't want to be the one
to blame for their breakup.

161
00:08:08,558 --> 00:08:10,994
Okay. I hear you.

162
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,739
- Iris.
- Flash.

163
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,148
Be great to call you by your real name.

164
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:29,782
You mean like Ralph?

165
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:32,151
Is your name Ralph?

166
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,926
What did you want to see me about?

167
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,628
My boyfriend, he's...

168
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:40,062
Did you guys break up?

169
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:43,064
- No.
- Oh.

170
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:47,569
He's a cop and he thinks
that you're dangerous.

171
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,773
And he's trying to convince
his boss that you're a menace

172
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:51,343
that needs to be stopped.

173
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:55,046
I thought I should warn you.

174
00:08:55,047 --> 00:08:58,681
Anyways, you should probably go.

175
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,219
You're not going.

176
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,688
Barry, are you there?

177
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:06,123
- What?
- The police got a ping

178
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:07,891
from the tracer hidden in the stolen cash.

179
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:10,459
SWAT team's closing in
on the 1600 block of Pass.

180
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:14,027
Now stop ruining Iris' love life and go.

181
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:16,163
I've gotta run.

182
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:19,634
I bet you say that to all the girls.

183
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:22,304
What other girls?

184
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,197
He always paid in cash.

185
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,799
- Never seemed like trouble.
- He's on the move.

186
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:49,670
- Freeze!
- Hold it right there!

187
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:53,742
- Hands up.
- Is there a problem, gentlemen?

188
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:55,342
Certo.

189
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:00,780
Turn around!

190
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:07,154
Certo, what are you waiting for? Cuff him!

191
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:09,591
You don't tell me what to do.

192
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,095
Get down!

193
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,679
Ugh! Ah!

194
00:10:29,617 --> 00:10:31,383
Nice mask.

195

196
00:10:45,797 --> 00:10:47,601
It's kinda comforting
to know that no matter

197
00:10:47,602 --> 00:10:50,801
what city you go to, Big
Belly Burger is always

198
00:10:50,802 --> 00:10:52,503
going to taste like Big Belly Burger.

199
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:55,206
You mean full of grease and salt?

200
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:57,273
I thought those were
the secret ingredients.

201
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:00,976
Oliver's back.

202
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,879
By the way, I gave Oliver,
like, 1/2 hour head start.

203
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,949
- Hi, Barry.
- Hey, Felicity.

204
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:11,552
How you doing, Dig?

205
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:13,654
You're fast.

206
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:15,087
Did you guys not tell him about me?

207
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:17,989
Seeing is believing, or...

208
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,058
Drooling.

209
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:31,137
Hey, thanks for showing up
back there, but I had that.

210
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:33,240
- Uh-huh.
- What, I was getting ready

211
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:35,310
- to make my move.
- What move?

212
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,811
- The one to the morgue?
- Wait, so what are you guys

213
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:40,747
- doing in Central City?
- Working a case.

214
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:44,852
Suspicious homicide in the
styling where the murder weapon

215
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:47,054
is a boomerang.

216
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:50,727
Cool.

217
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,395
I mean, awful.

218
00:11:52,396 --> 00:11:54,364
I found traces of iron oxide on it.

219
00:11:54,365 --> 00:11:56,468
I know it's a long shot,
but Central City has

220
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:58,599
the highest concentration
of iron oxide in the country.

221
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,862
Did you know Australian aboriginals

222
00:11:59,863 --> 00:12:01,649
use boomerangs to hunt? Mainly on kangaroo,

223
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,641
which is a surprisingly
low-fat source of prot...

224
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:05,209
We were following up a lead

225
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,241
when we heard the S.W.A.T. Raid
over the radio, and I thought

226
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:11,075
that I would come by...
Watch you make your move.

227
00:12:11,076 --> 00:12:13,179
I had a cousin got hit by lightning once.

228
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,246
He just developed a stutter.

229
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,912
Huh. Well, my team and I

230
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:19,745
are after a nasty meta-human
who makes people angry.

231
00:12:19,746 --> 00:12:21,045
Cool.

232
00:12:21,046 --> 00:12:22,913
I mean, awful.

233
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,781
Uh, well, since you guys are
here, why don't we team up?

234
00:12:24,782 --> 00:12:26,482
I'll help you find your
boomerang man, you can help me

235
00:12:26,483 --> 00:12:28,150
- find my super rage-a-holic.
- We'd love to.

236
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:30,353
No, we'll handle our
business and head home.

237
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,089
The fastest way to find out
everything we need to know

238
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,756
about the boomerang is to
sic S.T.A.R. Labs on it.

239
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:36,057
Enough people know my secret identity.

240
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:38,794
Fine... I'll go. They
already know who I am.

241
00:12:38,795 --> 00:12:42,465
You can drop me off, and I
will meet up with you later.

242
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:44,666
- How 'bout I give you a lift?
- Whoo!

243
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:51,006
Man, that's not freaking you out?

244
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:54,108
Let's go.

245
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:00,319
- Oh!
- So what'd you think?

246
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,555
I think...

247
00:13:01,556 --> 00:13:03,393
My shirt's on fire!

248
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:06,066
Oh, I'm sorry!

249
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:13,413
I'm glad I decided not to go braless.

250
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:14,910
You guys remember Felicity?

251
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,213
I'll always remember this.

252
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,285
Hi, Felicity, it's so good to see you.

253
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:21,719
What brings you back to Central City?

254
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,921
Not Barry?

255
00:13:22,922 --> 00:13:24,323
No, not Barry.

256
00:13:24,324 --> 00:13:26,793
This? Not happening.

257
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:29,261
We looked down that road and
we said “no, thank you.”

258
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:31,399
they get it.

259
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,036
Actually, I'm here... because of this.

260
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:36,836
Awesome!

261
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,471
What are the wings made of?

262
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,373
Not sure... I'm thinking
some sort of composite

263
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:42,010
or high-density plastic...

264
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,113
Reinforced with carbon
fiber. Oh, that's weird.

265
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,915
- It almost feels like it's...
- Vibrating.

266
00:13:45,916 --> 00:13:47,517
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

267
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:49,152
Oh, I wanna run some tests,

268
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,521
- and I wanna run 'em right now!
- Mm-hmm.

269
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:55,060
Hey, you guys come up with
anything new on our meta?

270
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:56,996
The officer who was
affected tonight says he saw

271
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:59,501
a flash of red before he lost control.

272
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:03,174
I suspect the meta is inducing
rage via the ocular nerve.

273
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,311
Oh, Dr. Wells wants to see you.

274
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,717
Why do I feel like I just got called

275
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,120
into the principal's office?

276
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,858
Starling City vigilante.

277
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,826
He calls himself “The Arrow” now.

278
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:22,296
Oh, does he... “Flash”?

279
00:14:22,297 --> 00:14:24,266
Wait, what's the problem?

280
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:26,503
We don't trust him.

281
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:28,505
You guys don't even know him.

282
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,241
I know that he was wanted for murder

283
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:32,746
in at least 12 different
cases dating back three years.

284
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,914
I know there's been at least
two major terrorist attacks

285
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,082
in Starling since he became active.

286
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,683
All right, but the cops
there are cool with him now.

287
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:39,752
He doesn't kill people anymore.

288
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,368
And what about all the criminals

289
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:43,621
that he put arrows through?
Those, what, don't count?

290
00:14:43,622 --> 00:14:47,259
- He's a hero, Joe.
- You're a hero, Barry.

291
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,270
You offer protection, hope, light.

292
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:53,770
What that man does is carry out
a dark reckoning for his city.

293
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:56,307
It is a brutal, violent vision of justice,

294
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:57,828
one we do not share. You truly think

295
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:59,912
he's a hero, fine, so be it.

296
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:03,517
But he's not the kind you
should be looking up to.

297
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:08,392
Aah!

298
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,034
That's my bad. That's on me.

299
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,078
I want that “Arrow” out of my city.

300
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:25,312
Tonight.

301
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:29,362
I mean, do you think he can
do everything really fast?

302
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:31,821
I mean, like, how fast do you
think he goes to the bathroom

303
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:33,791
after he's eaten something?

304
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,792
This is you watching my back?

305
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:39,661
Well, the Mirakuru soldiers
are one thing, but this...

306
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:42,029
Whatever he can do now,
he's still the same Barry

307
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,696
- we met last year.
- Well, if you're so adamant

308
00:15:43,697 --> 00:15:45,964
against teaming up with
him, what are we doing here?

309
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:49,267
He's a good kid, and
it's just a name, Diggle.

310
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,772
The man who rents this storage unit...

311
00:15:52,773 --> 00:15:56,605
I want... his... name.

312
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,318
Hey.

313
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:06,856
The bad guy that you're after,
the one who robbed the bank,

314
00:16:06,857 --> 00:16:08,725
his name is Roy G. Bivolo.

315
00:16:08,726 --> 00:16:11,992
Uh, thanks. How did you find that out?

316
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:15,999
The guy's still alive, right?

317
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,368
I'm just asking.

318
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,138
I thought you didn't want to help.

319
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:22,808
I'm not. It's just a name.

320
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:23,976
- All right.
- Hi.

321
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:25,512
- Hey.
- Ooh!

322
00:16:25,513 --> 00:16:28,185
One non-fat latte,
extra sugar for Felicity,

323
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,923
and one coffee, black, for Oliver.

324
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,359
I brewed you a fresh pot, so...

325
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,229
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

326
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,297
Barry, um, can I talk to you for a second?

327
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,297
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

328
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:43,899
Bye.

329
00:16:46,837 --> 00:16:48,438
Ow. What are you doing?

330
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:51,442
You did not tell me that
you knew Oliver Queen.

331
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,878
- I know Oliver Queen.
- Oh, my God,

332
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,412
he's even more handsome in person.

333
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,546
And his arms are, like,
twice the size of yours.

334
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,784
Technically they're not twice the size.

335
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,117
He's on my three list.

336
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,817
- What's a three list?
- My list

337
00:17:01,818 --> 00:17:03,685
of three guys I'm allowed
to cheat on Eddie with.

338
00:17:03,686 --> 00:17:05,554
You usually don't meet people on your list,

339
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:10,127
but now here he is, and I just
cannot stop staring at him.

340
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,733
Felicity, this is me noticing you staring.

341
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,001
We need to help Barry with his case.

342
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,602
Why don't you want to help?

343
00:17:18,603 --> 00:17:20,540
Because Barry doesn't really want my help.

344
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,408
He only thinks he does.

345
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,975
Harrison Wells and Barry's cop foster dad

346
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:27,881
both said you were dangerous
and a bad influence.

347
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,650
Barry defended you.

348
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:32,184
You're going to hock me about this

349
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,856
until I say yes, aren't you?

350
00:17:34,857 --> 00:17:38,192
I'm a hocker.

351
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:42,729
Okay.

352
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,307
- Okay, what?
- Okay, we'll help you

353
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:45,261
catch your bad guy.

354
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,599
Great. Meta-human.

355
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,436
I am not calling him that, Barry.

356
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,906
Partners?

357
00:17:52,907 --> 00:17:55,375
Partners.

358
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,819
- Hey.
- You're late.

359
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,885
Barry, how can you have super-speed

360
00:18:11,886 --> 00:18:14,323
- and still not be on time?
- Sorry, I guess

361
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:17,425
the super-tardiness kinda neutralizes it.

362
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:20,164
So how do we catch Bivolo here?

363
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,134
Oh, no, we don't here. We're here to train.

364
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,502
What? Like Rocky?

365
00:18:27,004 --> 00:18:29,539
I read your friend Iris'
blog post on The Flash,

366
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,642
and I visited all the
crime scenes you fought at.

367
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,113
- Don't you sleep?
- Last month

368
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,083
you took on a man named Lenard Snart.

369
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,518
We call him Captain Cold.

370
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,466
We can talk about you giving your enemies

371
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:40,887
silly code names later.

372
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:44,091
You mean like over coffee with
Deathstroke and The Huntress?

373
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,094
The point is that you engaged
Snart on a commuter train,

374
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:48,927
which he derailed.

375
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,992
Okay, there may have been some
damage, but I got the job done,

376
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:53,895
- I was the hero.
- Barry, when you approach

377
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:57,501
a new environment, do
you case every inch of it?

378
00:18:57,502 --> 00:19:01,473
You could. You have the time.

379
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,310
But you don't.

380
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,480
You just run in blind.

381
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:09,914
There's a difference,
Barry, between having powers

382
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,382
and having precision.

383
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,736
When I came to you thinking about

384
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:13,751
going out and helping people,

385
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,451
you said I could be an inspiration.

386
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,152
Living this life...

387
00:19:17,153 --> 00:19:18,988
Well, it takes more than a mask.

388
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:20,657
It takes discipline.

389
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:23,096
And since you are probably
as stubborn as I am...

390
00:19:23,097 --> 00:19:26,365
What is that for?

391
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,299
You're going to run over there,

392
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,901
you're going to come back at me,

393
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,498
and you're going to get hit with an arrow.

394
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,103
No, I'm not.

395
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:36,338
Yes, you are.

396
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:38,939
Okay, fine,

397
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,040
I will humor you.

398
00:19:42,243 --> 00:19:44,378
Ready?

399
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,482
Ready.

400
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,323
Nice try.

401
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:56,461
Gah! Ah!

402
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,729
What, you shot me?

403
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,430
I heard you heal fast.

404
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,036
Oh, God!

405
00:20:09,213 --> 00:20:11,548
Hey. What's up?

406
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:15,586
Eddie's making his case
for the task force again.

407
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,620
But I thought the Captain
shot him down already.

408
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:20,622
Well, apparently he's got a new argument.

409
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:23,591
The Arrow made another
appearance last night.

410
00:20:23,592 --> 00:20:26,463
And you forgot to tell me
that you got Bivolo's name

411
00:20:26,464 --> 00:20:28,633
from shooting that storage guy in the leg.

412
00:20:28,634 --> 00:20:30,602
Well, technically I didn't shoot him.

413
00:20:30,603 --> 00:20:32,239
Well, what word would you use to describe

414
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,741
how you got this info?

415
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:37,679
I'm gonna go with “torture.”

416
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,850
I don't... The Arrow gets results.

417
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:41,586
He's a crazy man.

418
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,789
Look, I don't actually
disagree with you at the moment,

419
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,223
but we wouldn't even have Bivolo's name

420
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:47,022
if it weren't for The Arrow.

421
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:50,092
So maybe instead of judging him,
you should just be thanking him.

422
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:52,196
Two things I won't be doing in this life...

423
00:20:52,197 --> 00:20:56,933
Playing professional baseball,
and thanking that lunatic.

424
00:20:58,936 --> 00:21:00,804
Stay.

425
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:02,438
Have you heard of color psychology?

426
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:04,316
The theory that changes
in the color spectrum

427
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:05,340
can affect emotion.

428
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,576
It is so nice to have
another woman to talk to.

429
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:08,977
I know.

430
00:21:08,978 --> 00:21:10,479
I was thinking that if Bivolo uses color

431
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,313
to induce the temporary psychosis,

432
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,384
maybe we can use light
and color to reverse it.

433
00:21:14,385 --> 00:21:18,487
Miss Smoak, a word, if you please.

434
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:24,731
Hey, what's up, doc?

435
00:21:24,732 --> 00:21:26,631
Sorry, that was dumb.

436
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:28,434
Remember I went to M.I.T.

437
00:21:28,435 --> 00:21:30,203
Yes, you're smart.

438
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:33,304
Felicity, I like to surround
my team with known quantities.

439
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,806
That is because I find the unknown

440
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,979
to be toxic, dangerous.

441
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,183
The Arrow is unknown.

442
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,221
I can assure you, Dr.
Wells, he's not dangerous.

443
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:48,289
To us.

444
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,324
Well, of that, I have little doubt.

445
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:54,896
And yet, I find myself with a conundrum.

446
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:59,828
How can I completely trust a man
when I don't even know his name?

447
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,931
And so, I was hoping, Miss Smoak,

448
00:22:01,932 --> 00:22:04,465
that you could help me trust him.

449
00:22:04,466 --> 00:22:08,271
Who is he under the hood?

450
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:11,876
That is not my secret to tell, Dr. Wells.

451
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,685
Of course.

452
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:24,155
I'll figure it out on my own.

453
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,195
- Hey.
- Hey.

454
00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,605
How'd it go with Oliver?

455
00:22:29,606 --> 00:22:31,742
You know, to be honest,
not exactly the partnership

456
00:22:31,743 --> 00:22:32,432
I thought it would be.

457
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,634
Oh, did he really do the
thing with the arrows?

458
00:22:34,635 --> 00:22:36,271
You knew he was going to shoot me?

459
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,806
Whoa, it is practically impossible to tell

460
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:38,893
when Oliver's making a joke.

461
00:22:38,894 --> 00:22:40,678
Hey, we just got a ping from

462
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,080
the facial recognition
software on Bivolo, aka, Prism.

463
00:22:43,081 --> 00:22:45,216
Since when do we have
facial recognition software?

464
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:46,831
- Happy Chanukah.
- Where can I find him?

465
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,132
Traffic cameras just caught
him entering a residence

466
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,102
at 168 Jarvis.

467
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,804
We should let The Arrow know.

468
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,472
I can handle this solo.
I've done it before.

469
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:56,006
Barry, I really think you need to wait...

470
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:59,609
Felicity, I don't need his help.

471
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:23,203
I knew you'd be coming for me.

472
00:23:23,204 --> 00:23:25,841
I could see it in your eyes at the bank.

473
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:29,283
When I turned those
people against each other,

474
00:23:29,284 --> 00:23:32,250
it made you angry.

475
00:23:37,527 --> 00:23:40,530
Have some real anger.

476
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:52,712
No signs of macular damage.

477
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:55,507
Your retina and cornea seem unaffected.

478
00:23:55,508 --> 00:23:56,909
I told you, I'm fine.

479
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,745
You said Bivolo whammied you.

480
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:01,283
No desire to go MMA on any of us?

481
00:24:01,284 --> 00:24:02,517
No.

482
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:04,819
Yeah, I mean, something weird happened

483
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,889
- with his eyes for a sec.
- Weird thing?

484
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,392
Yeah, everything went red.

485
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,292
You were right.

486
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:14,293
Okay, next thing you know, Bivolo was gone.

487
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:16,430
Look, obviously his powers
didn't work on me, so...

488
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:18,499
It was stupid for you
to go out there alone.

489
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,337
You take too many risks.

490
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:22,838
As fast as you are, that's
going to catch up with you.

491
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,340
Caitlin, I'm not Ronnie.

492
00:24:24,341 --> 00:24:26,609
You gotta stop treating me like I am.

493
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:32,716
You're right. You're not.

494
00:24:37,587 --> 00:24:39,222
What?

495
00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:42,426
You are such a lovable dummy.

496
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:48,164
It's Oliver... he wants
to have another session.

497
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:51,002
I'm sure he's not going to shoot you again.

498
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,771
Maybe you should wear body armor.

499
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,881
Thinking of new ways to embarrass me?

500
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:01,651
I'm not trying to embarrass you, Barry,

501
00:25:01,652 --> 00:25:04,922
but you went after Bivolo last night alone

502
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:06,458
and you lost him.

503
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:08,524
And you've never had a misstep?

504
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:10,292
Course I've had missteps.

505
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:14,662
Barry, I have been living this
life for almost eight years,

506
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,696
encountering things that
you can't even fathom,

507
00:25:17,697 --> 00:25:20,428
and I am still alive.

508
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,763
Not because super-speed
kept me out of the ground.

509
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:28,564
It was because I realized
that I needed to keep learning,

510
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:31,234
keep training, keep getting smarter,

511
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:35,408
and until you get that,
despite your best intentions,

512
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,244
you will do more harm than good.

513
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,684
I finally see it.

514
00:25:41,685 --> 00:25:45,019
You're a little bit
jealous of me, aren't you?

515
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,884
A guy like you, handsome, rich,

516
00:25:48,885 --> 00:25:50,717
can have any girl he wants,

517
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,154
jealousy's probably a new emotion for you,

518
00:25:53,155 --> 00:25:55,992
so you might be a little
slow to get what it is

519
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:57,660
that you're feeling.

520
00:25:57,661 --> 00:26:00,529
- That's your theory?
- Absolutely.

521
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,264
So you can train, lift weights,

522
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:06,098
climb that stupid barn
till your heart explodes,

523
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:09,237
but you'll never be as fast as I am.

524
00:26:09,238 --> 00:26:12,677
You'll never be what I am.

525
00:26:12,678 --> 00:26:16,981
And that's gotta hurt your
rock-hard pride, Ollie.

526
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:20,617
I told Felicity you didn't want my help.

527
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:23,750
Yeah. You're finally right about something.

528
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,454
Allen! Where are you with the Bivolo case?

529
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:30,857
I'm working it.

530
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:32,561
Care to be more specific?

531
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:34,798
Hey, how 'bout you answer
me when I ask you a question?

532
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,934
Hey! How 'bout you back off?

533
00:26:36,935 --> 00:26:39,404
Excuse me?

534
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:42,710
Look, I work just as hard
as anyone in this building.

535
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:45,813
I don't need you constantly
berating me to do my job.

536
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:47,747
When it's done, you
will have it, all right?

537
00:26:47,748 --> 00:26:51,152
Sorry, captain. He's
having an allergic reaction

538
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,123
to some bad medication.

539
00:26:53,124 --> 00:26:56,091
You remind him who answers to who.

540
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,693
Have you lost your mind?

541
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:01,714
I'm so sick of Singh
talking to me like that.

542
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:02,766
He's still our boss.

543
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,602
Now I know you're upset
about losing Bivolo...

544
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:07,839
Wait, wait... You're just like him.

545
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,777
Like Wells, and Oliver, and
everyone else my whole life

546
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:12,411
that didn't think I could get the job done.

547
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:15,196
Do you want to help me,
Joe? You want to help me?

548
00:27:15,197 --> 00:27:16,614
Get my dad out of prison.

549
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:18,725
You helped put him there, didn't you?

550
00:27:18,726 --> 00:27:20,487
Barry, I need you to calm down.

551
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:23,455
Why don't we both take
a ride to S.T.A.R. Labs?

552
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:25,120
I'm calm! Okay?

553
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:28,955
When I am not calm, you'll know.

554
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:38,832
Okay. I'll call you back later.

555
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,300
That was The Arrow.

556
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:42,835
He says Barry is acting strangely.

557
00:27:42,836 --> 00:27:44,071
Strangely, how?

558
00:27:44,072 --> 00:27:46,539
He's been whammied.

559
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,175
He was acting angry. It was scary.

560
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:52,513
And his eyes... They glowed.

561
00:27:52,514 --> 00:27:55,050
It's possible that his body
is fighting off the effect,

562
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:57,051
- so it's hitting him slower.
- When it comes to rage,

563
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:58,518
that is not a good thing.

564
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,819
The longer you suppress your emotions...

565
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,421
The bigger the explosion.

566
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:04,225
Considering what he can
do, how do we even stop him?

567
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:07,324
A cold-gun would come in
real handy right about now.

568
00:28:07,325 --> 00:28:09,458
- Hey.
- I'm just sayin'.

569
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:12,597
None of us can stop Barry.

570
00:28:12,598 --> 00:28:16,066
Fortunately, Felicity
knows someone who can.

571
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:19,703
I think you better call back Oliver Queen.

572
00:28:19,704 --> 00:28:23,105
We're gonna need The Arrow's help.

573
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,446
Is this your way of telling me

574
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:39,927
that you want satellite
radio for Christmas?

575
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,701
Look, I am not mad at you.

576
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:47,007
Good, 'cause there's
no reason you should be.

577
00:28:47,008 --> 00:28:51,077
Eddie, both you and The Flash
care about protecting this city.

578
00:28:51,078 --> 00:28:53,177
You would both give your lives for it.

579
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:55,178
You're more alike than you think, okay?

580
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:58,315
He's not the bad guy.

581
00:28:58,316 --> 00:29:01,483
How do you know so much about him, Iris?

582
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:07,122
He got in touch with me
after I started the blog,

583
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:10,958
and I've seen him a couple times.

584
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,960
A couple times?

585
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,864
Why didn't you tell me about this?

586
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:16,587
Well, given the fact
that I think he's a hero,

587
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,932
and you want to put him in jail,

588
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,700
do you really need to ask that question?

589
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:23,340
How could you ever think
I would be okay with this?

590
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:36,722
I heard you've been looking for me.

591
00:29:41,576 --> 00:29:43,758
All this time, you've
been trying to catch me,

592
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:46,995
and I caught you first.

593
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:49,265
Guess you haven't read
your girlfriend's blog.

594
00:29:49,266 --> 00:29:50,468
Eddie, no!

595
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:59,944
Ooh, see I knew The Arrow was Oliver Queen.

596
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:02,514
I mean, I had it narrowed down
to, like, a list of 150 people,

597
00:30:02,515 --> 00:30:05,384
but he was definitely on that list.

598
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:08,088
Do you have a way to
stop Barry's rage-fest?

599
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:09,657
I have an idea about how to do that.

600
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:11,857
Joe, we're gonna need your help.

601
00:30:11,858 --> 00:30:13,890
We need to find him first
before he hurts somebody.

602
00:30:13,891 --> 00:30:15,757
I have him.

603
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:19,293
Facial recognition picked him
up on a traffic camera downtown.

604
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:20,960
Oh, God.

605
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,433
Eddie!

606
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,200
Who the hell are you, huh?

607
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,634
You think you can just come along

608
00:30:30,635 --> 00:30:32,738
and get to have whatever you want?

609
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:34,541
What gives you the right?

610
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,209
What the hell are you talking about?

611
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,078
What are you doing?
What has happened to you?

612
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,313
I feel fine.

613
00:30:40,314 --> 00:30:42,016
You are not fine.

614
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:44,618
How would you know?
Because you write about me?

615
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:47,152
You don't know me!

616
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:49,222
You don't know who I am.

617
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:51,293
- You never did.
- I know that you have

618
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:53,928
risked your life to help people,

619
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:55,996
to save them! Someone who does that

620
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:59,469
does not suddenly turn around
and want to hurt people.

621
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,239
Please.

622
00:31:10,317 --> 00:31:11,618
Run!

623
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,685
Eddie, run!

624
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:18,227
You need to calm down.

625
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:21,132
And you need to hold on.

626
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:28,581
I just hope they can turn Barry back

627
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:29,644
before he kills Oliver.

628
00:31:29,645 --> 00:31:31,229
Me, I'd be more worried about what Oliver

629
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,614
might have to do to Barry.

630
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:34,883
Barry has superpowers.
Oliver has a bow and arrow.

631
00:31:34,884 --> 00:31:36,485
Do you have any idea how many people

632
00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:38,787
Oliver has killed with that bow and arrow?

633
00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:41,322
Recurve bow arrows can travel
up to 300 feet per second,

634
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:42,657
so, like, 200 miles an hour.

635
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:44,358
Barry can run three times that fast.

636
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,859
Whatever. Oliver's been doing this

637
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,860
a lot longer. My money's on experience.

638
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:49,196
My money's on speed.

639
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:50,565
Please tell me you're not actually

640
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:52,726
having this conversation right now.

641
00:31:57,036 --> 00:31:58,541
You missed.

642
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,076
No.

643
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:02,276
Aah!

644
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:14,157
2000 milligrams of horse tranquilizer

645
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:15,958
should be hitting you any time now.

646
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:46,427
Where you going?

647
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:48,126
We're not done!

648
00:32:57,507 --> 00:33:00,143
Is that all you got?

649
00:33:38,302 --> 00:33:40,937
Oliver, get up.

650
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:47,378
Fool me once.

651
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:57,387
Ah... ah... ah!

652
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,959
I still believe in you, Barry.

653
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:14,904
Is this even going to work?

654
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:16,469
He just needs to see the right colors.

655
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:19,073
Now, Joe!

656
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:44,833
Barry, you okay?

657
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:50,370
Oh, this is going to be a
special kind of hangover.

658
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,511
So...

659
00:34:59,512 --> 00:35:02,046
It was a tie.

660
00:35:03,249 --> 00:35:05,252
Oliver...

661
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:06,586
I'm so sorry.

662
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:08,454
It's not your fault.

663
00:35:08,455 --> 00:35:11,856
But we do still have your
meta-human to take care of.

664
00:35:11,857 --> 00:35:14,025
Anything left in the tank?

665
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:16,896
Well, if not, there's two of us, right?

666
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:19,262
Right.

667
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:27,088
You think this will stop me?

668
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:29,256
I will make you tear each other to pieces!

669
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:30,791
You will all die screaming with rage!

670
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,844
Blah, blah, blah, “no
prison can hold me.”

671
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:35,379
heard it all before, pal.

672
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,847
Adios, Prism.

673
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:38,949
I liked “Rainbow Raider.”

674
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,624
Okay, you don't get to pick the names.

675
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,319
I have a prison like this.

676
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,191
Mine's on a nearly inhospitable
island in the north China Sea,

677
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:48,459
but this works too.

678
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:52,799
My identity is a closely-guarded
secret known only to a few,

679
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,435
and if it were to get out,
will endanger my family,

680
00:35:57,436 --> 00:36:00,471
my friends, and it would embolden

681
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:03,240
my enemies to retaliate at me through them.

682
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,876
What Oliver is trying to say

683
00:36:05,877 --> 00:36:07,479
is that he had a lovely
time working with you

684
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,648
and getting to know each of you,

685
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:12,383
and he can't wait to do it again soon.

686
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:14,318
Right.

687
00:36:14,319 --> 00:36:18,456
You know, it didn't sound
like that's what he was saying.

688
00:36:18,457 --> 00:36:21,461
I may not agree with your methods, but...

689
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:24,064
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

690
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:25,800
Hey. If I had a DNA sample

691
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:27,569
I was unable to fully break down,

692
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,338
do you think you could isolate
the genetic markers for me?

693
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:32,274
Sure, what's the sample from?

694
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,377
The Canary's murder.

695
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:37,311
Of course.

696
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:43,289
Mr. Queen, I met your father once.

697
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,358
Charity event.

698
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,425
One of the things we spoke of was you.

699
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:53,664
I think he would be very
proud of the man you've become.

700
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:55,332
Thank you.

701
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:59,670
And please, call me Oliver.

702
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:08,343
There is something off about that guy.

703
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:18,089
Captain Singh approved the task force.

704
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,791
You wanted me to believe
The Flash was real.

705
00:37:20,792 --> 00:37:22,993
Now I do.

706
00:37:22,994 --> 00:37:24,960
I believe he's dangerous,

707
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:28,095
and I am going to take him in.

708
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:30,499
How do you feel about that?

709
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:34,106
All I know...

710
00:37:34,674 --> 00:37:36,608
Is how I feel about you.

711
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:52,633
Hey! You guys heading home?

712
00:37:52,634 --> 00:37:54,300
Yeah, we could use some Javas for the road.

713
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:55,366
I will hook you up.

714
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:58,237
- Okay.
- Thank you.

715
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:03,809
Uhm, so listen...

716
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:07,183
I'm really sorry for
what I said in the field

717
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,150
and then last night in the street.

718
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:12,219
I wish I could say it was
all because of whatever Bivolo

719
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,553
did to me, but I guess I had

720
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:17,054
more feelings bottled up than I thought.

721
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,858
You can always talk to me.

722
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,525
Yeah. Thank you.

723
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:25,126
And you were right, I still have...

724
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:26,994
A lot to learn.

725
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,896
There's one more thing...

726
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:31,599
And you're not going to like it.

727
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,702
Does it involve you
shooting me in the back?

728
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:37,608
No. No, the heart.

729
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:42,814
That's not going to work out for you.

730
00:38:42,815 --> 00:38:44,715
You need to let her go,

731
00:38:44,716 --> 00:38:47,918
for both of your sakes.

732
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:59,163
Guys like us don't get the girl.

733
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,901
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:06,072
- This one's yours.
- Thank you.

735
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:07,938
Oliver.

736
00:39:09,907 --> 00:39:12,474
- Hi.
- Hi.

737
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:15,912
- How are you?
- Good, good.

738
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:18,345
It's been a long time.

739
00:39:20,548 --> 00:39:23,518
We never spoke after, and I'm so sorry.

740
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:26,552
No, I'm sorry.

741
00:39:26,553 --> 00:39:29,256
I heard about your mother...

742
00:39:29,257 --> 00:39:31,325
She loved you very much.

743
00:39:33,228 --> 00:39:35,160
She did.

744
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,903
- I should get going.
- All right.

745
00:39:44,205 --> 00:39:46,206
- Who was that?
- Hmm?

746
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:51,847
Someone that I used to know.

747
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,085
Hi, sweetheart.

748
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:57,692
Yes, I'm just getting you a hot chocolate.

749
00:40:00,228 --> 00:40:03,100
Mommy will be home soon.

750
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:13,780
Got your message.

751
00:40:13,781 --> 00:40:17,381
I wanted you to know, last night...

752
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:18,983
That wasn't me.

753
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:20,650
Sure looked like you.

754
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,819
Yeah. I was affected by
one of the meta-humans.

755
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,820
He messed with my head.

756
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:29,157
But I'm okay now, I promise.

757
00:40:29,158 --> 00:40:31,694
I defended you.

758
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,562
Everyone told me that you would
bring me nothing but danger.

759
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:37,695
My father, Barry, Eddie...

760
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:41,500
I didn't listen to them.
I never listened to them.

761
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:44,769
But now it's time I did.

762
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:48,573
Don't contact me anymore, okay?

763
00:40:50,543 --> 00:40:52,879
Iris...

764
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,484
I'm sorry.

765
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:58,751
Me too.

766
00:41:34,093 --> 00:41:38,026
Look at that. Better than an ATM.

767
00:41:38,027 --> 00:41:40,992
Anyone tell you not to hang
out under the freeway at night?

768
00:41:40,993 --> 00:41:44,231
You're liable to get robbed.

769
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:45,701
You got the shakes, man?

770
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:48,565
What are you, tweaking, or just cold?

771
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,741
I'm not cold.

772
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,529
