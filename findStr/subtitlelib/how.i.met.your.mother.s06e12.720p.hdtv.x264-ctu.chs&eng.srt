1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,910
2010年12月 我和朋友们决定
In December of 2010, my friends and I decided

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,700
去电影院看"生活多美好"
to go see It's a Wonderful Life on the big screen.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,800
电影似乎就是我们现在所需要的
It seemed like something we all needed.

4
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:10,300
毕竟那几天我们确实过得很疯狂
After all, it had been a crazy couple of days.

5
00:00:10,436 --> 00:00:11,490
这都是由...
It all started...

6
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:13,060
验孕引发的 几天前
with a pregnancy test. （A COUPLE DAYS EARLIER)

7
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:15,009
等结果真是煎熬啊
This is taking forever.

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,009
你确定你测试方法对吗?
Are you sure you did it right?

9
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:19,549
就是在一根棍子上尿尿 还能出什么错吗?
Is there a wrong way to pee on a stick?

10
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:23,572
嘿 我能问你个困扰我多年的问题吗?
Hey, can I ask you a question  that's plagued me for years?

11
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:24,749
女人尿尿瞄得准吗?
Can girls aim?

12
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:26,449
额 那男人瞄得准吗?
Um, can boys aim?

13
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:28,589
因为好像我每两天
'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking a mop

14
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,489
就要拖一次厕所
to that bathroom floor every two days.

15
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:33,368
那是因为你把搞笑日历挂在厕所啊
Okay, you're the one who put the  Far Side calendar up over the toilet.

16
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:34,929
你知道我一笑就动全身
You know I laugh with my whole body.

17
00:00:37,335 --> 00:00:38,400
2分钟到了
It's been two minutes.

18
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:44,439
一 二 三
One, two, three.

19
00:00:46,166 --> 00:00:47,740
- 是阳性 - 是阳性? 是阳性吗?
- It's positive.  - It's positive? It's positive?

20
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,780
- 是阳性的 - 是阳性的?
- It's positive.  - It's positive?

21
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,780
阳性的!
It's positive!

22
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,980
是阳性的啊!
It's positive!

23
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:55,500
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

24
00:00:55,837 --> 00:00:56,700
什么?
What?!

25
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:58,700
我从没见过这个女人!
I've never seen that woman before in my life!

26
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:01,716
不好意思 条件反射了 恭喜!
Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations!

27
00:01:02,986 --> 00:01:04,586
敬Lily和Marshall
To Lily and Marshall.

28

谢谢
Well, thank you.

30
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:08,996
我是说 我们从没这么开心过
I mean, we've never been happier.

31
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:11,222
我想现在没什么能打击我了
Can't imagine anything  bringing me down right now.

32
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:12,796
你没怀孕
You're not pregnant.

33
00:01:13,558 --> 00:01:15,556
额 这打击到我了
Well, that did it.

孩子们 在这个36小时的故事里
Kids, this is the story of the 36 hours

38
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,705
我们原先都以为Lily怀孕了
we all thought Lily was pregnant,

39
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:35,956
而这件乌龙也让我们 重新审视了我们的人生
and how it caused each of  us to reexamine our own lives.

40
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:37,210
因为这事发生的时候...
Because while this was happening...

41
00:01:37,216 --> 00:01:38,686
你确定你验孕方法对吗?
Are you sure you did it right?

42
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:40,056
我正和Punchy煲电话粥
...I was on the phone  with Punchy,

43
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,386
他是我高中的死党
my best friend from high school,

44
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:43,254
最近邀请我做他的伴郎
who had recently asked me to be his best man.

45
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:44,948
嘿 Punchy 我仔细考虑了
Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought.

46
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:46,427
我想我知道该怎么
I think I know how we can crush these

47
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:47,759
摆花了
floral arrangements.

48
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,021
啊 有主意了 快说吧 老兄!
Ah, here it comes. Hit me up, Schmos!

49
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:54,148
牡丹和薰衣草上面再配上满天星
Peonies, lavender blossoms with a  halo of baby's breath

50
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:56,567
营造一种万物回春的气息
for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation.

51
00:01:56,568 --> 00:01:57,931
震撼到了吧?
Crushed it! ?

52
00:01:57,932 --> 00:02:01,751
庆祝爱情就是需要这种搞怪的调调
That's exactly the accent of  whimsy this celebration of love needs!

53
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:03,676
那天肯定会很赞
It's gonna be a magical day.

54
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,316
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're thinking.

55
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:07,681
我真希望我是个纯爷们
I wish I was a dude.

56
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:09,605
我确实希望你是个纯爷们
I do wish you were a dude.

57
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:10,685
因为我要是个爷们
Because if I was a dude,

58
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:13,152
我就会让Ted Mosby做我的伴郎
I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.

59
00:02:13,153 --> 00:02:15,023
我就不会 我来告诉你原因
No, and here's why.

60
00:02:15,024 --> 00:02:16,761
Ted 伴郎的职责
Ted, the best man's job

61
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,963
不是去想花怎么安排
is not to crush the floral arrangements.

62
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:22,023
而是陪着新郎走到红地毯上
It's to get the groom down the aisle,

63
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:25,048
因为无论他是谁 那天他都会崩溃的
because, no matter who he is,  he will freak out.

64
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:26,851
我不觉得你有那个能力
And I just don't think you have what it takes

65
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:28,867
让士兵拿起来复枪
to get that get that soldier to  pick up his rifle

66
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:30,305
冲向山
and charge up the hill.

67
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:32,474
额 你忘了我曾做过这事吗?
Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before?

68
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:33,863
我是Marshall的伴郎啊
I was Marshall's best man.

69
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:35,816
那天后来怎么样了?
And how did that go again?

70
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:40,064
0比1
O for one.

71
00:02:40,065 --> 00:02:41,914
拜托 那不是我的错
Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault.

72
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:44,627
要不要我提醒你下 我的致辞可堪称完美
And need I remind you,  I gave a beautiful toast.

73
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:45,956
Ted
Ted.

74
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:51,096
0 你愿意娶1为你的法定妻子吗?
O, do you take one to be your  lawfully wedded wife?

75
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:53,078
哦 天哪 我要崩溃了
Oh, God, I'm freaking out.

76
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,548
我为什么就选了Ted做我的伴郎呢?
Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?

77
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,606
额 是啊 被一个录了七集
Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism

78
00:02:57,685 --> 00:02:59,796
猜硬币赢百万的人批评
from someone who just recorded seven episodes

79
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:01,506
我还真是难以接受
of Million Dollar Heads or Tails.

80
00:03:01,671 --> 00:03:03,464
孩子们 猜硬币赢百万
Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails

81
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,024
是一档收视率很高的节目
was an extremely popular show

82
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,024
但是内容却相当无聊
with an extremely simple premise.

83
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,975
好了 你刚抛的是
All right, your practice flip came up

84
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:09,957
背面...
tails...

85
00:03:09,958 --> 00:03:11,866
但是我们的维加斯庄家说过
but our Vegas oddsmaker tells us

86
00:03:11,867 --> 00:03:14,924
下一次正反面的概率还是各为一半
that the next toss is still just 50-50.

87
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:16,002
那么 Jordan
And so, Jordan,

88
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:18,486
一百万美元...
for one million dollars...

89
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,326
正面... 还是背面?
...heads... or tails?

90
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:27,590
这枚硬币的年份是什么时候?
What was the year of the coin again?

91
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:29,376
为什么突然迷上了猜硬币啊?
Why this sudden obsession  with Heads or Tails?

92
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,166
事情是这样的
Well, it turns out

我搬来这里
I moved here

121

是为了在一流的有线新闻电视台工作
to work for a big-time cable news channel

122
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:42,400
像是环球新闻
like World Wide News.

123
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,842

我还以为你终于能去环球新闻面试了
I thought you finally got that  interview at World Wide News.

130
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,405
我的确去了 但是他们只提供给我一份无聊
Well, I did, but they only  offered me a boring,

131
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:06,715
收入低 还不会上镜的研究工作
low-paid, off-camera research job.

132
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:09,215
但这可以成为 你发展以后事业的垫脚石啊
Which could be a stepping stone  to bigger things in your career.

133
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:11,685

现在她完全是个名人了
and now she's totally winning  Celebrity Rehab.

138
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:25,695
看起来Robin主意已定
It seemed like there wasno  changing Robin's mind.

139
00:05:25,943 --> 00:05:27,795
但我们不知道的是 就在那一刻

140
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:30,735
我们的世界就要发生 翻天覆地的变化了

141
00:05:31,246 --> 00:05:32,575
我怀孕了

142
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:33,805
什么?
What?!

孩子们当你的朋友们有好消息的时候

145
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,115
但接着你就会反省自己
And then you start thinking about yourself.

146
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:41,800
哦 我的天哪
oh,my god

147
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,915
他们真的要有孩子了

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,890
啊 糟了
Oh, crap.

27
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,860
Lily怀孕了 而我吓坏了
Lily's having a baby and I'm  having a panic attack.

28
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,960
我希望他没有看出我在想什么
I hope she can't tell what  I'm thinking right now.

29
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,300
我可以
I can.

30
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,670
我也很紧张
And I'm freaking out, too!

31
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,300
我肚子里有个外来生物在生长
There's an alien growing in my stomach

32
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,370
我的子宫会爆裂的
that's gonna explode out of my vagina!

33
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,240
你觉得他们知道我们吓坏了吗?
Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out?

34
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,080
我这辈子做过什么了
What am I doing with my life?

35
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,680
我要拿我人生怎么办呢
What am I doing with my life?

36
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,980
我得准备明晚 看电影吃的圣诞主题零食
I should get a Christmas-themed  movie snack for tomorrow night.

37
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,120
他们向我们压来了
They're totally onto us.

38
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,250
我们要怎么办
What do we do?

39
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,850
继续笑就好 或许挥挥手
Just keep smiling, maybe wave.

40
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,950
不 不要挥手
No, don't wave!

41
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,950
这样说不通
That makes no sense!

42
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,150
我已经挥了
I'm committed.

43
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,760
我一直挥到我筋疲力尽而死
I'm riding this wave straight to hell.

44
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,520
我们走吧 那你的挥手就说得通了
Let's leave, then the waving will make sense.

45

随后Marshall和Lily回家了
So Marshall and Lily headed home.

46
00:14:01,735 --> 00:14:03,230
Lily我们得放松
Lily, we have to relax.

47
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,760
没有必要那么紧张
There's no need to panic.

48
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,860
是啊 很多事情要去做
True, there's a lot to do,

49
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,170
但是我们有九个月的时间去准备

50
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,570
所以我建议我们列一个清单
So I say that we just  make a list of everything

上面写着孩子出生之前 我们要做的事情

We were freaking out for  about a day and a half there.

104
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,690

105
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,890
或许我们对孩子的事情还没有准备好
maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all.

106
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,030
是啊 我们想或许我们可以先养只狗

养只狗

你们之前一天到晚都想要有孩子

116
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,140
不 不能接受
No. Unacceptable!

Barney你穿这件西装 看起来非常可笑

你要退了这件衣服 把钱拿回来
You're gonna go get your money back

128

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,400
我说的慈善 不是你在邮件里说的那个
And I don't mean that  stripper you keep e-mailing us about,

130
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,730
尽管我们拼命哀求 你别再发这种邮件过来
even though we beg you  to take us off that list.

131
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,270
我不能把这件西装退了
I can't give this suit back.
