尊贵级别客户无需排队

我朋友伯特・坦纳经营这个酒店

他免费提供给我们几间房

13
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,860
因为我们卖给他几组橱柜
because we sold him some closets

00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,410
安装在他的那些土豪套房里
for his high-roller suites.

斑纹木  可加温的袜子抽屉

举行我们的告别单身派对
Bachelor-party weekend.

26
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,560
我们要在六月结婚了

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,020
我们很想邀请你们的
Oh, we really wanted to invite you,

29
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,770
但是蒂姆的家庭成员太多
but Tim's family is huge --

30
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,400
没事的  我们要在五月结婚
Relax. We're getting married in May

31
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,560
也没邀请你们  所以
and you're not coming, so...

32
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,650
米奇尔
Mitchell.

33
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,320
真好  我们现在都看开了
Oh, look at us moving on.

34
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,060
就像你从未在我跟你说我爱你的
It's almost like you never dumped me in an e-mail

35
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,300
第二天早晨用一封邮件把我甩了
the morning after I told you that I loved you.

36
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,900
我得辩解一下  邮件
Well, y-- in my defense, e-mail --

37
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,920
在那时候还是新鲜玩意
it was new back then...

38
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,900
而且还很难说
...and it was still a blurry line

39
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,340
用什么方式是合适的
as to what was appropriate and...

40
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,760
我们这周末非常忙
Well, we have a pretty packed weekend.

41
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,070
没错  如果你们有时间
Oh, we do,but if you guys have some time,

42
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:10,060
这是我们的日程表
here's our itinerary.

43
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,180
-好的  -一起来玩吧
- Okay.  - Come play.

44
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,960

46
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,010
天啊
Oh, my gosh,

47
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,120
一个真正的同性恋日程
an actual gay agenda.

48
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,120
[Gay agenda指为维护同性恋权益做出的种种努力]

49
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,930
看来这些天不会经常看到你们两个了
Looks like we're not gonna see much of you two this trip.

50
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,900
-不  -不会不会
- No. - No, no.

51
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,690
我们是不会参加这上面的任何活动的
We are not participating in any of this.

52
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,520
他们对于单身派对很挑剔的
They're very judgy about bachelor parties.

53
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,770
我提出要帮他们办
I offered to throw them one,

54
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,180
结果被讲了一通大道理
and I got a whole lecture.

55
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,540
我们已经40了  还有个孩子
We're 40. We have a child.

56
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,890
我们已经在一起十年了
We've been together for 10 years.

57
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,780
又来了
That's the one.

58
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,310
我们已经不是那样的人了
It's just not who we are anymore.

59
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,110
听听这个  "香蕉小屋泳池派对"
Listen to this -- "Bananas and cabanas pool party."

60
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,180
-天啊  小卡  -没错
- Oh, Cam.  - Yeah.

61
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,760
"最具创意泳装获得者
"Most creative speedo

62
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,710
将赢得苏格兰短裙士兵欢乐秀的门票"
wins tickets to the kilty pleasures."

63
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,650
-不要  -得了吧
- No!  - Please.

64
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,000
什么是苏格兰短裙士兵欢乐秀
What is the kilty pleasures?

65
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,230
这个
This.

66
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,830
我们将在水疗室维护我们的尊严  谢谢
We will be maintaining our dignity in the spa, thank you.

67
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,410
拜托
I mean, come on,

68
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,060
哪有苏格兰人晒到这么黑的
have you ever seen a scottish person this tan?

69
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,960
我光看着都觉得难为情
I'm embarrassed even looking at it.

70
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,480
那就别看了
Then stop.

71

那个加温抽屉实在太好使了
Whoa, that warmer drawer really works.

83
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,020
感觉像是我妈又一次抱着我的脚
It's like my mom's hugging my feet again.

84
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,460
我要去购物了
I'm gonna go do some shopping.

85
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,050
那我们待会儿再碰头
Oh, well, maybe we'll catch up later.

86
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,320
不用了  你忙你的
No, you have your day,

87
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,200
我忙我的
I'll have mine.

88
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,070
那五点在酒吧见好吗
Well, how 'bout the bar at like 5:00?

89
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,060
好的
Sure.

90
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,830
她在跟我冷战
She was icing me,

91
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,490
但是我罪有应得
but I deserved it.

92
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,880
我平生第一次
For the first time in my whole life,

93
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,140
忽视了她
I was neglecting her.

94
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,380
我受邀去参加一个
I'd been invited to audition

95
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,550
拉斯维加斯秘密魔法学会的面试
for a secret magic society in Las Vegas,

96
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,400
但当我没日没夜地彩排时
but in all my rehearsals,

97
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,040
就忽略了克莱尔的存在
I'd paid no attention to Claire.

98
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,360
我甚至有一次把她单独留在了影院
I even left her alone in a movie theater once.

99
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,150
大事不妙
Oh, no.

100
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,000
我让菲尔以为我还在生他的气
I let Phil think I was still mad at him

101
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,930
因为我需要点私人时间
because I needed a little time to myself.

102
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,280
快到老娘怀里  太棒了
Come to mama! Yeah!

103
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,010
几年前  菲尔和我攒了些钱
Years ago, Phil and I put aside money

104
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,540
为了在结婚25年纪念日出去旅行
for a trip on our 25th anniversary,

105
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,650
但有个周末我和女朋友们
but I lost that money on

106
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,610
去赌城把钱输光了
a girls' weekend in vegas.

107
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,440
从那时起  我就在执行一个秘密任务
Since then, I've been on a secret mission

108
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,810
为了把钱赢回来
to win that money back,

109
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,480
如果这周末一切顺利的话
and if things go well this weekend,

110
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,220

118
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,030
我是您的管家

先生  我能不能接下来
Can I just segue, sir,

124
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,960
向您介绍我会如何保护您的隐私
to the importance of discretion in my job?

125
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,530
我就把这些放在...
I'll just pop those --

126
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,010
不不不  不用管了
Oh, no, no, no. Never mind those.

127
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,620
- 如您所愿   - 我等下有个约会要用到它
- As you wish.   - They're for an appointment I have later.

128
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,480
你知道的越少越好
The less you know about that, the better.

129
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,830
实在非常抱歉  先生
A myriad of apologies, sir.

130
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,920
如果没有别的事...
If there's nothing else...

131
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:39,610
等下
Oh, hang on.

132
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,490
你知道哪儿能洗披肩吗
Actually, do you know where I can get a cape laundered?

133
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,510
歌剧还是那种超级英雄披肩
Opera or superhero?

134
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,320
不便透露
I'd rather not say.

135
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,910
这个问题越线了
I overstepped the mark by asking.

136
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,700
我能不能小小地介绍下
Uh, could I just, uh, quickly point out

137
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,320
我们的豪华沐浴服务  先生
our luxury bath service, sir?

138
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,660
我们提供五种超级豪华沐浴套餐
We have five outrageously decadent baths

139
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,560
您若需要我马上就能为您准备好
that I can prepare for you at a moment's notice.

140
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,900
不过需要说明的是
Uh, I should just point out, though,

141
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,210
"法老的幻想"套餐需要花费一点时间
that our Pharaoh's Fantasy does take a dash longer,

142
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,430
因为我们的努比亚人演员不常驻酒店
normally, because our Nubian lives off-site.

143
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,510
如果没有别的吩咐
Um...if there's nothing else,

144
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,360
我就帮您把箱子放好
I'll just help you with your case.

145
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,600

Mr. Tucker?

158
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,770
有几位客人决定不去布兰妮的演唱会了
We had a few no-shows for the Britney concert, so...

159
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,170
我要一张  谢谢
One, please.

160
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,470
那米奇尔呢
Uh, what about Mitchell?

161
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,730
这里是赌城  他不需要知道我在做什么
It's Vegas -- he doesn't need to know what I'm doing.

162
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,170
我也不需要知道他在做什么
I don't need to know what he's doing.

163
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,040
所以如果你见到他
So if you see him,

164
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,250
也别告诉他我在做什么
maybe don't mention what I'm doing.

165
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,180
了解
Oh. Understood.

166
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,030
你有挨着走廊的座位吗
So, do you have anything on the aisle?

167
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,380
哪位
Yeah?

168
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,340
拉斯普京的达马西亚人淹死在伏尔加河

我知道如果杰看到丽巴卡
I knew if Jay saw Rebarka,

203
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,950
他也会想买的
he would want her too.

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,100
是的  那是她的名字  丽巴卡
Yeah, that's her name -- Rebarka.

如果我们要去赌博
if we're going to gamble,

207
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,490
也许我需要那件幸运毛衣
maybe I need my lucky sweater.

208

你能去房间里帮我拿来吗
Can you go and get it in the room?

你怎么还有幸运毛衣
Who has a lucky sweater?

210
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,480
你看超级杯赛时还穿两只不一样的鞋呢

211
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,370

这架电梯是去顶层的
This elevator goes to the top floor.

220
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,450
我以为尊贵级别就是顶层  62层
I thought excelsior was the top -- 62.

221
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,300
曼德勒海湾酒店有63层

等等  他们可以上去吗

224
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,890
他们穿的是粗布工作服啊
They're wearing dungarees.

225
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,450
[曼德勒海湾酒店]

Okay, odds on four and a five each on "C" And "E."

238
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,500
你刚才说什么
What are you talking about?

239
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,970
是巴克利的女款
It's the lady version of Barkley.

240
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:22,880
我得预订上
I have to put it on hold

241
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,900
这样杰就算看到也买不到了
so that Jay, if he sees it, he can't buy it,

242
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,580
然后走时我会把帐销掉的
and then I will cancel the charge before we leave.

243
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,330
赢家是  四  真不易
Winner-- four the hard way!

不  亲爱的  你哪都别去

你是我的幸运女神

抱歉我的按摩师一直在放恩雅的音乐
Sorry, my masseuse was blasting the Enya.

253
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,410
你接下来想干点什么呢
So, what are you gonna do next?

254
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,520
泡个澡
A long soak?

255
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,500
还是蒸个桑拿
A long sauna?

256
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,700

257
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,030
是吗  我想泡个澡

258
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,190
泡澡也不错
Ooh, a soak does sound nice.

259
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,610
要不我还是蒸桑拿吧
Maybe I'll do a sauna.

260
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,650
你脸上那是亮粉吗
Is that-- is that glitter on your face?

261
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,950
是啊  我的按摩师可能夜间兼职
Yeah, I think my masseuse might moonlight.

262
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,770
拉斯维加斯嘛
Vegas.

263
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,050
-好吧  一小时后见  -好的
- All right, I'll see you in an hour.  - Okay. Yeah.

264
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,470
好好享受吧
Enjoy it. Really have fun.

265
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,000
放松  米奇尔
Relax, Mitchell.

266
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,030
菲尔  该你了
Phil, you're up.

267
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,110
好的
Okay.

268
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,510
化茧成蝶的奇迹
The miracle... of metamorphosis.

269
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,610
人们说唯一不变的是变化
They say the only constant is change.

270
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,900
然而一切都将变  不同
Well, all of that is about to ch-- be different.

271
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,430
注意这只是个粗麻袋
Note the simple burlap sack,

272
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,240
家里随意都能找到
the kind you'd find in any home.

273
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,460
可以麻烦你帮我一下吗
If you'd be so kind as to assist me,

274
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,110
孩子
the-- the-- the Kid,

275
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,390
我要尽力证明一些变化是漫长的
I'll endeavor to prove that some change is glacial,

276
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,760
而有一些变化是瞬间的
while some change is instantaneous.

277
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,070
现在麻烦你把粗麻袋提起来
Now, if you'd be so kind as to raise the simple burlap sack

278
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,910
提过我的头  在我手腕处收紧
above my head and pinch my wrists.

279
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,780
注意时间是4点02分
You'll note, the clock says exactly 4:02.

280
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,970
我的表是3点15
I have 3:15.

281
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,130
我的是6点35
Yeah, I have 6:35.

282
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,730
凯撒杀手
Kaiser Mayhem!

283
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,530
是我干的
It's what I do.

284
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,280
等等  已经5点20了吗
Wait, it's 5:20?

285
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,760
我得给我太太打个电话
I actually have to call my wife.

286
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,750
不行  菲尔  不能在魔术半途停下来
Oh, no, Phil, you can't just stop in the middle of a trick.

287
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,820
这是基本的行规
That's a cardinal rule.

288
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,800
各位  这是紧急情况
Guys, it's an emergency.

289
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,360
别跟我说你们从未
Don't tell me you've never

290
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,890
不得不停下来打给另一半
had to call your spouse.

291
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,760
你们  你们会找到另一半的
Oh...there's-- there's people for you.

292
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,800
拜托  克莱尔  快接啊
Come on, Claire. Please pick up.

293
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,050
又是这位女士赢了
And the lady wins again.

294
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,750
很好  很好
Yes! Yes!

295
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,440
我做到了  我做到了
I did it! I did it!

296
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,870
我做到了  我赢回了我的钱
I did it! I won back my money.

297
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,390
认输吧  豪斯
Oh, suck it, the house.

298
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,630
克莱尔  钥匙
Claire, the key.

299
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,980
好的  好的  给你
Yeah, okay, here you go.

300
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,380
给自己买点闪闪的东西吧
And, hey, buy yourself something sparkly.

301
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,600
歌洛莉亚  我们上面还有一层
Gloria, there's a floor above us.

302
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
-什么  -是啊  我也很震惊
- What?!   - I know. It threw me, too.

303
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,720
高级尊贵层
Excelsior plus.

304
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
但对于那层的人来说
But to the people on that floor,

305
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,350
我们就是次级豪华
we're excelsior minus.

306
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,410
那上面有什么呢
Mm, what is up there?

307
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,750
得拿黑卡才能进入
You need a black card to get in.

308
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,890
可我们只有这破烂银卡
All we've got is this stupid silver one.

309
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,360
我还以为是铂金卡呢
Oh, I thought it was platinum.

310
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,540
这是垃圾
It's crap.

311
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,660
为什么
Uh, why-

312
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,960
你何不打给你的朋友伯特
why don't you call your friend Burt

313
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,370
跟他说我们需要黑卡呢
and tell him that we need the black card?

314
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,380
因为他不是我的朋友
Because he's not my friend.

315
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,000
我都没见过他
I never really even met him.

316
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,840
我可能就在一次电话会议上听到过他咳嗽
I think I heard him cough one time on a conference call.

317
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,310
不知道他为什么要这么对我
I don't know why he would treat me this way.

318
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,550
-不是吧  -怎么了
- Oh, come on!   - What?

319
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,160
不是吧  你是杰・普里契特
Oh, come on! You're Jay Pritchett!

320
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,970
你要找到你的朋友伯特
You're gonna find your friend Burt

321
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,920
告诉他你是谁
and tell him who you are,

322
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,710
你会要到黑卡
and you're gonna get the black card,

323
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,420
因为当你决定做一件事
because when you set your mind on something,

324
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,860
没人能阻止你
nobody can stop you!

325
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,480
没错
Right!

326
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,590
等等
Wait!

327
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,080
从那边走
Go that way.

328
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,810
不好意思
Excuse me,

329
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,360
橱窗里那只狗多少钱
how much is that doggy in the window?

330
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,580
我终于从赌城手里拿回了属于我的东西
I had finally taken back from Vegas what Vegas took from me.

331
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,790
那种满足感很难形容
That's a feeling of satisfaction I can't describe...

332
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,690
因为没持续太久
Because it didn't last very long.

333
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,830
-克莱尔  -什么事
- Oh, hey, Claire.  - Yeah?

334
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,530
-你看到小卡了吗  -没有
- Have you seen Cam?  - No.

335
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,580
我们应该呆在一个地方好让他找到我们
Although...we should stay in one place so he can find us.

336
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,320
找个二十一点牌桌怎么样
How about a blackjack table?

337
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,690
不  我刚做完按摩和桑拿  很困
Oh, no, I'm really worn out from my massage, the sauna...

338
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,570
排出了很多毒素
It was just-- it was a lot of detoxing.

339
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,700
知道你需要什么吗
You know what you need?

340
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,860
-来点毒素  -不
- Some toxing.  - No.

341
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,190
玩几盘二十一点  再喝几杯龙舌兰
Hand of blackjack, couple of tequilas.

342
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,960
来嘛  可好玩了  快去
Come on, it'll be fun. Do it.

343
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,300
你听起来就像小时候
You sound just like the kid who bullied me

344
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,840
逼我抽第一支烟那个人
into smoking my first cigarette.

345
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,470
也许这次你不会告发我
Maybe this time you won't tell on me.

346
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,710
-继续拿牌  -好
- And then hit.  - Yes.

347
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,920
继续拿牌  然后停牌
And then hit. And then stay.

348
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,660
-我知道怎么玩  -好吧
- I know. I have it.   - Okay.

349
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,240
十八点  十九点  十八点
18, 19, 18.

350
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,600
你赢面很大
You are in a great position right now.

351
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,740
庄家是二十一点
Oh, the dealer has 21.

352
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,560
她的牌更好
Hers is better.

353
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,100
真不好意思  米奇尔
I am so sorry, Mitchell.

354
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,940
可我保证我们刚刚每一步都做对了
I promise you, we did everything right.

355
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,480
别太不爽
Don't be mad.

356
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,630
-我没有不爽  -真的吗
- I'm not mad.  - Really?

357
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,450
我只是  只是太激动了
T-that was -- that was thrilling. I'm...

358
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,450
-我心跳加快了  -是吧  好玩吧
- My pulse is racing.  - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

359
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,150
-真谢谢你让我玩这个  -那当然
- Thank you so much for making me do this.   - Yeah.

360
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,430
我要再玩一局
I'm going to play another hand.

361
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,560
我们要再玩一局
We're going to play another hand.

362
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
不是我们  是我
No, alone.

363
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,890
-我不带你玩  霉运走开  -真的吗
- Not with you. You're bad luck.   - Really?

364
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,270
走远一点
Go -- far.

365
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,340
我一摆脱她
The minute I got rid of her,

366
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,800
就开始一路狂赢
I couldn't lose.

367
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,350
赌钱真好玩
Oh, gambling's fun.

368
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,080
还很简单
And easy.

369
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,450
你好  土豪哥
Hey, big spender.

370
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,560
你在干什么呢
What are you doing?

371
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,890
赌博  我现在是个赌徒
Gambling. I'm a gambler now.

372
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,480
-本性暴露了啊  -没错
- Look at you, letting loose.   - Yeah.

373
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,310
我想通了
Yeah, I guess I figure

374
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,040
不管在赌城玩得多疯
whatever mischief one might get into in Vegas

375
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,110
出了赌城就都不存在了
kind of remains here within the limits of the city, you know?

376
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,470
-这想法很酷  -是吧
- That's a cool way to think about it.  - Yeah.

377
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,240
我真的很高兴在这里碰到你
You know, I'm really glad that you came over here.

378
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
真的吗  为什么
Really? Why is that?

379
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,270
我一直很遗憾
Well, I always hated the way

380
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,150
我们当年结束得不太愉快
that things ended between us, you know?

381
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,050
说不定我们现在可以尝试好好相处
Maybe now we can go out on a better note.

382
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,530
-那样很好  -没错
- That's nice.   - Yeah.

383
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,110
天啊

6-2-3-3  这是我的房号
6-2-3-3, that's -- that's my room number.

385
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,850
要牌
Huh. Um, hit me.

386
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,530
七
Seven!

387
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,600
是二十一点
That's 21, huh?

388
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,260
太棒了
Yes! Yeah! Ah!

389
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,620
瞧瞧  你真厉害
Whoa, check you out.

390
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,440
我觉得今晚是我的幸运之夜
I guess tonight's my night to get lucky.

391
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,000
我也觉得
I would say.

392
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,480
-给你  -谢谢
- Here you are. - Thank you.

393
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,190
-我们说不定很快就会再见面  -好
- Maybe I will run into you again, huh?   - Okay.

394
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,210
那个  你
Oh, you...

395
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,030
这里有2140美金  希金斯
There are $2140, Higgins,

396
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,940
天降横财  天降横财
for nothing -- nothing!

397
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,050
我要做点疯狂的事
I want to do something crazy.

398
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,570
我要订一个沐浴套餐
Okay, I'm gonna order a bath.

399
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,330
先生  我觉得您好像癫狂了
Sir, it seems to me like you've gone mad.

400
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,260
要的就是这个效果
Okay, this is what I want.

401
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,400
我想来点浪漫
I want something romantic,

402
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,820
但又带点危险的
but also a little dangerous.

403
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,960
浪漫又危险
Romantic, dangerous --

404
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,360
如果让我建议的话  电子乐沐浴怎么样
might I suggest, sir, the techno bath?

405
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,240
您的心脏将和贝司一起脉动
Your heart will throb with the bass

406
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,940
您的双眼将享受一场超高端激光秀
while your eyes take in an off-the-scale laser light show

407
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,610
一切都在最私密的贵宾场所进行
from that most intimate of V.I.P. arenas

408
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,640
也就是您自己的浴缸
-- your own tub.

409
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,690
好  就要那个了
Okay. I want that.

410
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,110
正是我想要的
That's what I want.

411
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,900
我觉着小红帽实际上是只大坏狼
Me thinks the little red riding hood may be a big, bad wolf.

412
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,480
我很快就带着需要的东西回来
I'll be back shortly with supplies.

413
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,500
好
Okay!

414
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,360
邓菲先生  今晚
Ah, Mr. Dunphy! How are...

415
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,410
过得怎么样
...we this evening?

416
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,220
不怎么样
Not so good.

417
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,070
跟我老婆起了点摩擦
I'm in a tight spot with my lady.

418
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,120
你知道什么能有所帮助吗
You know what might help?

419
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,220
不如来一个那种  豪华沐浴套餐
One of those -- one of those luxury baths.

420
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,480
将她置于温暖的泡澡水当中
Ah, get yourself out of some hot water

421
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
以解救自己于水深火热之中
by getting her into some.

422
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,750
太棒了
Wow, so good.

423
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,750
我的建议是麦可・布雷泡泡浴
Might I suggest the Michael Buble Bath?

424
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,910
你简直会读心术
You are a mind reader.

425
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,620
我不会读心术  先生
I'm not a mind reader, sir.

426
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,290
我只是从九十年代起
I've just been in the bath-buttling business

427
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,290
就干沐浴管家这行了
since the early '90s,

428
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,030
尽管我看起来很年轻
despite my fresh face.

429
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,240
所以我很了解什么情况选什么套餐
So I tend to know what these situations need.

430
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
-我这就去放水  -如您所愿
- I'll get the water going. - As you wish.

431
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,420
反正价格都一样
Same price either way.

432
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,230
伯特说他马上就过来
Burt says he's gonna be here any minute.

433
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,440
我们一定要好好招待他
We got to really lay it on for this guy --

434
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,210
最好的苏格兰威士忌  穿得性感点
best scotch, put on something sexy.

435
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,870
我  我有个好主意
I... have a great idea!

436
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,340
雪茄
Cigars!

437
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,200
伯特那种男人一定会喜欢上好的雪茄
A man like Burt appreciates a good cigar.

438
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,950
这主意不错
Good thinking!

439
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,240
当然要是在楼上  管家早就来了
Of course, upstairs, the butler would be here already.

440
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,020
我告诉你吧
I'm telling you,

441
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,560
我们这就跟睡在地下室一样
we might as well be sleeping in the basement.

442
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,740
我说的是"存"货不是"送"货
I said hold it, not deliver it!

443
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,900
好吧  这边
Okay, there.

444
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,050
过来这里
Come here.

445
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,020
好好待在克莱尔的屋子里
Stay in Claire's room.

446
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,960
亲爱的  我在浴室里呢
Hey, honey. I'm in the bathroom.

447
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,910
亲爱的
Honey?

448
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,850
好吧  我知道我错了
Okay, I-I know I messed up,

449
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,560
但坐好  我为你准备了惊喜
But sit tight -- I got a little surprise for you.

450
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,050
希金斯  你有空吗
Higgins, you got a minute?

451
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,770
一小时里有60分钟有空
60 an hour.

452
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,670
全都由您支配  先生
They all belong to you, sir.

453
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,410
我需要尽快搞一些高级雪茄
I need a couple of primo cigars, A.S.A.P.

454
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,230
我不在乎它们是如何到达我们国家的
I'm not a stickler for how they got in the country.

455
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,940
我还在等一瓶特制苏格兰威士忌
I'm also expecting a special Scotch delivery.

456
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,020
还需要刮个胡子
I need a shave.

457
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,440
我不能这样去见伯特
Burt can't see me like this.

458
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,790
很遗憾  剃须管家只在
Unfortunately, the shaving butlers are all --

459
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,510
我知道  只有高级尊贵层有
I know, excelsior plus.

460
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,110
-方便进来吗  -方便
- Are you decent?   - I am.

461
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,550
很快就不方便了哦
Well, not for long.

462
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,940
我的爱人随时就要回来了
My partner should be here any minute.

463
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,490
先生  是我的原因吗
Is it me, sir,

464
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,000
还是这空气中本就充满了情爱的氛围
or is the air positively fizzing with erotic anticipation?

465
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,720
是啊
Yeah.

466
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,500
我忘了拿冰块
Oh, I forgot the ice.

467
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,330
我这就去拿
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna get it.

468
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,100
怎么能让您去呢
Oh, I couldn't ask you to do that.

469
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,020
不  没关系的
No, not a problem.

470
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,670
那好吧
As you wish.

471
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,140
反正都是一样的价格
Same price either way.

472
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,270
不好意思
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

473
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,600
我想找米奇尔
I-I'm looking for Mitchell.

474
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,790
是的  他正在等您
Oh, yeah, he's expecting you.

475
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:01,200
事实上  他让我帮两位准备了沐浴
In fact, he's asked me to draw the two of you a bath.

476
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,800
-太疯狂了  -是啊
- This is crazy.   - Yeah.

477
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,170
我觉得这正是他的本意
I believe that's the plan.

478
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,700
请尽情享受
Enjoy.

479
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,560
谢谢
Thank you.

480
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,070
太好了  你回来了
Oh, good. You're back.

481
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,220
克莱尔看起来心情如何
How's Claire seem?

482
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,920
什么
I'm sorry?

483
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,370
你在外面肯定碰到她了吧  她生气了吗
You must have seen her out there. Is she mad?

484
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,630
她在干什么
W-what's she doing?

485
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,030
她在除尘  先生
Uh, she's dusting, sir.

486
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,310
她生气时总是喜欢打扫
Oh, she always cleans when she's mad.

487
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:29,950
帮我个忙
Do me a favor --

488
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,570
给她拿杯饮料
Bring her a drink

489
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,560
让她在沙发上休息一下
and tell her to get comfortable on the couch.

490
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,690
她可以趴上家具是吧
She's -- she's allowed on the furniture, is she?

491
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,530
她是我妻子
She's my wife.

492
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,570
太好了  我正在找你 
Oh, good! I've been looking for you.

493
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,950
你应该正在找一个
Well, you should have been looking for somebody

494
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,510
正在找你的人
who was looking for you,

495
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,560
因为那正是我在做的事
because that's what I was doing.

496
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,090
快来  我给你准备了惊喜
Come on, I have a surprise for you.

497
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,120
是啊  我一直在想
Yeah, I-I've been thinking

498
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,430
我们不能总是这么紧张又保守
we need to stop being so uptight.

499
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,610
我们可是在赌城啊
We are in Vegas.

500
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,160
我们来找点乐子吧
Let's have a little fun.

501
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,070
我得努力适应一下  但好吧
Well, I'll have to wrap my head around that, but okay.

502
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,510
我正好知道要如何开始
Now, I have just the way to kick it off --

503
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,740
这件事我们可以一起做
something we could do together.

504
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,460
虽然尺度有点大
It's a little extreme,

505
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,220
-但我觉得那正是我们需要的  -好吧
- but I think it might be just what we need.   - Okay.

506
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,270
继续往里走
Go on in.

507
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,560
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

508
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,690
行了  小卡  我们应该放松一下
Oh, come on, Cam, we deserve this.

509
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,270
好了  你先进去
All right, you get started,

510
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,090
热一下身  我马上就来
and then I'll jump in when it starts to heat up.

511
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:18,850
米奇尔
Mitchell!

512
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,910
快来  不然我要把你扔进去了
Come on. Then I will throw you into it, tiger.

513
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,370
来嘛来嘛
Rub a dub dub.

514
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,140
天哪  不
Dear, no.

515
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,240
朗翰姆
Langham.

516
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,800
你们两个都来吗
Both of you?

517
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,170
那好吧
Huh. Well, okay.

518
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,800
不  不  不  不好
No. No. No, not okay.

519
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,700
你在这里干什么
What are you doing here?

520
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,820
你把房卡给我了
You gave me your room key.

521
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,720
什么
What?!

522
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,600
别装的这么吃惊
Don't act so shocked.

523
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
你在单身派对的时候跟我说
You told me at the bachelor party

524
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,150
你们两个有各自的生活
you two lead separate lives.

525
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,460
你去单身派对了
You went to the bachelor party?

526
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,050
是的  然后我开始为自己的行为内疚
Yes, and I was starting to feel bad about sneaking around,

527
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,210
但现在看来是我多虑了
but I guess I shouldn't have,

528
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,650
现在我明白你有什么打算了
Now that I see what you're up to.

529
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,700
我什么打算也没有
I'm not up to anything!

530
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,200
我是不小心遗落了房卡
I left my key by mistake.

531
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,450
我们显然都很焦躁
We're all obviously tense.

532
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,440
让我们都深呼吸一下
Let's take a deep breath...

533
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,160
进来浴缸里
Get in the tub...

534
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,540
没可能的
That's not happening.

535
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,020
你想跟我说一下
You want to tell me

536
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,710
你是如何"不小心"把房卡给了别人吗
how you "Accidentally" gave someone your key?

537
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,960
那你想跟我说一下你一整天是如何
You want to tell me why you spent all day

538
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,030
从某个男人的肚脐上喝龙舌兰酒的吗
sipping tequila out of some guy's navel?

539
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,760
你看见了
You saw that?

540
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,500
我猜的
I guessed.

541
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,230
伙计们  出了什么事
Hi, guys. What's going on?

542
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,570
克莱尔  你能等下再来吗
Hey, Claire. Can you please just come back?

543
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,540
我们正在吵架
We're in the middle of an argument.

544
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,190
我猜我知道原因
Oh. Bet I know why.

545
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,610
你们还要进来泡澡吗
Are you guys getting in the bath?

546
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,170
也许我猜错了
Or I'm way off.

547
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:12,930
朗翰姆
Langham!

548
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,490
是蒂姆  不能让他知道我在这
It's Tim.He can't know I'm here.

549
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,350
他有非常严重的信任问题
He has insane trust issues.

550
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,460
非常严重
Insane?

551
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,890
朗翰姆  你在里面吗
Langham, are you in there?

552
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,490
-从这个门出去  -在这里
- Go out this door.  - In here.

553
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,980
歌洛莉亚  快点好吗
Gloria, hurry up, will you?

554
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,600
他就要上来了
He's on his way up.

555
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,350
我要刮胡子
I need to shave.

556
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,930
你来啦
Oh, you're here.

557
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,830
我是杰・普里契特
Jay Pritchett.

558
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,920
谢谢你过来
Thanks for stopping by.

559
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,820
浴袍不错
Nice robe.

560
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,180
像《重回昨日》里那个何夫
Like Hef, Back In The Day.

561
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,400
我就有话直说了
I'm gonna cut to the chase.

562
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,940
我喜欢你的生活方式
I like your lifestyle.

563
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,460
我也想感受一下
I want a taste of it.

564
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,180
当然  我很荣幸  但是
Well, s-sure, that's flattering, but...

565
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,820
好吧  浴室是你的了
Okay, the bathroom is all you--

566
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,790
歌洛莉亚  这位是伯特・坦纳
Gloria, it's Burt Tanner!

567
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,540
那才不是伯特・坦纳
That's not Burt Tanner,

568
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,240
那是朗翰姆
that's Long-ham.

569
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,440
朗翰姆
Langham!

570
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,600
那玩意在这里干什么
What's that thing doing here?

571
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,350
享用一杯马天尼酒
Just enjoying a dirty martini

572
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,890
只为在那浴室中荡涤嬉闹
before a cleansing romp in the bath.

573
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,690
我不是为这位准备的沐浴
That's not who the bath is for.

574
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,560
我搞错了
Oh, my mistake.

575
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,640
欢迎您  克莱尔
Welcome...Claire.

576
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,640
[Claire有"洁净"的意思]

577
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,670
过了今晚
You're certainly gonna be clean

578
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,110
你一定会洁净如初的  不是吗
by the end of the night, aren't you?

579
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,130
杰  我的护发品都忘带了
Jay, I forgot all my hair products!

580
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,920
我去和克莱尔借一下
I'm going to borrow from Claire.

581
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,440
好  安全了
Okay, the coast is clear.

582
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,260
杰
Jay!

583
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,550
快走  快快快
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

584
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,500
菲尔  你在这里啊
Hey. Phil, there you are.

585
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,320
德奇  你怎么知道我在哪里
Ducky! How'd you know where I was?

586
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,820
这座城市由魔法师掌管
Magicians run this town.

587
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,690
真的吗
Really?

588
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,440
才不是  我是高级尊贵层的修面管家
No. I'm a shaving butler up on plus.

589
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,790
今天发生的事情让我感到很抱歉
Look, I felt bad about how things went down today,

590
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,970
所以我想过来再给你一次机会
and I-I just wanted to give you another shot.

591
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,260
这边请
Right this way.

592
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,510
我真的觉得你会喜欢我的表演
I really think you're gonna like what you see.

593
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,390
先让我布置一下
Okay, let me just get everything set up.

594
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,990
破茧成蝶
Metamorphosis.

595
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,310
人们说唯一不变的是变化
They say the only constant is change.

596
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,030
不好意思  那个是啥
I-I'm sorry, what -- I-- s-- what is that?

597
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,210
我也不知道
Oh, I don't even know.

598
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,120
可能是我老婆买的东西
Something my wife bought.

599
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,470
我来把它拿走  开始
Let me just get rid of it. Here we go.

600
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,990
不是吧  又触动人家没有老婆的痛处
Really, uh, rubbing it in on that wife thing, huh?

601
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,030
破茧成蝶
Metamorphosis.

602
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,380
伯特
Burt!

603
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,920
非常高兴你能从楼上降阶相见
Nice of you to come down a floor

604
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,730
来看看底层人民是怎么生活的
and see how the other half lives.

605
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,110
如果你愿意
If you will,

606
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,530
请帮我把它提过头顶  在我手腕处收紧
raise it above my head and pinch it at my wrists.

607
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,220
只管系紧扎好
Go ahead and make it good and tight.

608
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,150
不用给我放水
Don't be easy on me.

609
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,810
好了
Okay.

610
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,810
现在
Now...

611
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,730
就像小小的橡树子成长为参天大树那样
as the lowly caterpillar becomes the majestic butterfly,

612
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,950
卑微的毛毛虫变成了壮丽的蝴蝶
as the tiny acorn becomes the mighty oak,

613
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,910
于是  我们完成了
so, too, do we complete our...

614
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,830
破茧成蝶
metamorphosis.

615
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,350
所以这只是虚张声势的把戏而已
So, it's the Governor's Bluff.

616
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,070
不  这可是对虚张声势的极大改善
Well, it's a huge twist on the Governor's Bluff.

617
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,900
不不不
No, no, no, no, no!

618
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,870
这里还有其他的元素
There were other elements.

619
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,960
你把我弄慌了
You just kind of threw me off.

620
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,040
我都忘了  我本应该
I forgot -- I was gonna --

621
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,640
华丽丽地出场  我应该用一个
as a flourish I was gonna use one --

622
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,630
太赞了
A-- that's amazing!

623
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,650
你用这种
Y-you lull me with this--

624
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,030
快捷变装迷惑我
- with this hacky quick change,

625
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,530
与此同时
and the whole time,

626
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,150
却把一只狗模型变成了火辣女佣
you're changing the fake dog into a hot maid?

627
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,590
太有才了  这才是魔术
It's brilliant! It's magic!

628
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,560
不  那叫做破茧成蝶
No, that's metamorphosis!

629
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,080
和你一样  伯特
Like you, Burt,

630
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,960
我享受更上乘的东西
I enjoy the finer things.

631
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,750
事实上
As a matter of fact,

632
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:08,000
那可能是我为你定的古巴货到了
that's probably the Cuban I ordered for you.

633
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,190
小卡  要是你想要一场单身派对
Cam, if you wanted a bachelor party,

634
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,240
你早说就好了嘛
you should have just said something.

635
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,090
我是在到这里以后  才知道我想要的
Well, I didn't know I wanted one until we got here.

636
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,620
可你却一直这样叹气
And you're so "Eh, eh, eh,"

637
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,800
-我都不敢说什么  -好吧
- I-I was afraid to say anything.   - Okay, all right.

638
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,690
对于你们俩  幸运的是
Lucky for the two of you,

639
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,700
我比你们自己更了解你们
I know you better than you know yourselves,

640
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,620
而你俩所需要的是一点点
and what the two of you need

641
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,030
具有罪恶感的小乐趣
is a little guilty pleasure,

642
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,980
或者我可以称之为...
or should I say...

643
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,010
先生  您让我留意的苏格兰快递到了
The Scotch delivery you had me on the lookout for, sir.

644
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,860
我喜欢你的作风  普里契特
I like your style, Pritchett.

645
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,090
你入围了
You're in.

646
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,540
维加斯
Vegas.

647
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,730
这让我想起了我过世的爷爷
This reminds me of my late grandfather.

648
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,380
他是苏格兰人吗
He was Scottish?

649
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,520
他是脱衣舞男
He was a stripper.

650
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,050
好了
There we go.

651
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,490
孩子  你手艺不错
You've got the touch, kid.

652
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,760
我有幸继承了我母亲的小手  先生
I was blessed with my mother's small hands, sir.

653
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,110
我可以为您点一个免费赠送的
Shall I order your complimentary,

654
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,740
室内魔石按摩吗
in-room, hot-stone massage?

655
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,920
免费赠送的吗
Complimentary?

656
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,710
全都属于您高级贵宾体验之内的  先生
All part of the excelsior-plus experience, sir.

657
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,570
您先在私人健身泳池中泡一会儿再做更好
Might be nice after a dip in your private lap pool.

658
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,950
我从前怎么都没享受过这个
Oh, where has this been all my life?

659
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,230
我在电梯里看到一个竖琴师
You know, I saw a harpist in the elevator.

660
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,760
我们明天早午餐时可以让他过来演奏么
Can we get that for our brunch tomorrow?

661
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,620
要是我说了算肯定行  但是很遗憾
If it was up to me, yes, but unfortunately,

662
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,710
那是我们尊享极致会员的专属项目
that is reserved for our excelsior-ultra guests only.

663
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,770
62  63  64层
62, 63, 64!

664
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,650
你妹
Son of a bitch!
