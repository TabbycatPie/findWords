183
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,160
<i>We defeated them</i>
<i>using an explosive feedback loop.</i>

184
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,829
<i>But a drone survived. This one.</i>

185
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,331
<i>Apex.</i>

186
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,043
<i>It evolved into a singular creature.</i>

187
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,588
<i>A bio-mech with no allegiance.</i>

199
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,461
[Hayley] What is it doing now?

200
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:10,964
[gasps]

201
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,885
-Loa?
-<i>It is attempting to Drift with Hayley.</i>

202
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,693
-What happened?<i> </i>Are you okay?
-Yeah.

203
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,238
It just scanned all my memories of Boy.

204
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,949
I don’t think it was going to hurt Boy.

205
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,159
It's trying to protect him.

206
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,725
[both gasp]

207
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,561
Huh.

208
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,538
Did Apex just give us an arm?

209
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,832
I think it did.

210

[Loa]<i> The arm also appears</i>

219
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,590
[Hayley] Surprises?<i> </i>You mean weapons.

220
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,593
<i>One. A vanadium steel saber chain.</i>

221

Oh! Finally.

222
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:25,349
-We have a fighting chance.
-How does it feel?

223
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,267
Deadly.
