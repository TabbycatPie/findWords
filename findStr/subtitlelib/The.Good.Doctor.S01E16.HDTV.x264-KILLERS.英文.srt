43
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,570
My neighbor Kenny and his girlfriend go all the time.

44
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,730
The rides were actually fun, Claire,

45
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,100
even though they hurl you through the air very quickly

46
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,440
without a proper three-point seatbelt.

47
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,040
It was worth the $300 I spent.

48
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,840
What kind of carnival will cost you that much money?

49
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,950
It was not just the carnival.

50
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,000
Kenny's girlfriend wanted to go to see a movie afterwards,

51
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,070
but I just got the second edition

52
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,170
of Chaikof's "Atlas of Vascular Therapy"

53
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,710
so decided not to go.

54
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:29,710
And you paid for everyone?

55
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,200
I had to. I lost the bet.

56
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,550
Rounds will have to wait. We have a consult come up.

57
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,270
Hunter Denoble, 38 --

58
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,800
Came into the E.R. this morning complaining of severe neck pain.

59
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,560
X-rays show anterolisthesis.

60
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,920
A herniated disc -- 38 a little young for that, isn't it?

61
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,500
Unless there's a history of spinal trauma.

62
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,510
There is.

63
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,020
Hunter fractured seven vertebrae in his neck and back

64
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,720
in a motorcycle accident 10 years ago.

65
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,290
He's one of my first patients --

66
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,790
suffered complete paralysis from the chest down.

67
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,470
A few months back, just gnawing pain.

68
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,520
Ibuprofen usually took the edge off.

69
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,560
Every day?

70
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,870
Uh, yeah, give or take.

71
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,180
It's not that bad.

72
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,350
Last night things changed.

73
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,060
He couldn't move his neck at all,

74
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,850
and the pain medicine had no effect.

75
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,050
So, he wanted to tough it out, but I dragged him in here.

76
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,350
Yeah, it sounds like you.

77
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,420
Feel that?

78
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,090
Yeah.

79
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,520
- And that? - Mm-hmm.

80
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,620
I made partner at the firm.

81
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,160
I don't like to call in sick.

82
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,640
And let's face it, I've spent enough nights in hospital rooms for five lifetimes.

83
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,760
Can't argue with that.

84
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,270
Squeeze my hands.

85
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,580
- You have any tingling or weakness in your arms? - No.

86
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,020
The plain films showed what looked like a herniated disc --

87
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,930
which would mean...?

88
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,840
Artificial disc replacement --

89
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,710
Day procedure, he'd be out by the morning at the latest.

90
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,050
You married him?

91
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,210
Yes, three years ago in Cancun. It was lovely.

92
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,480
Even though he's in a wheelchair?

93
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,150
- Shaun. - Oh, no worries.

94
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,450
I get this all the time.

95
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,660
Sure, she can never wear heels, but think of the parking.

96
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,170
What happened?

97
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,470
Pain shot right down through my legs.

98
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,170
- Your legs? - Yeah.

99
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,990
I haven't felt anything below my chest in 10 years.

100
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,260
What the hell is going on?

101
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,470
♪ When I saw the break of day ♪

102
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:32,500
♪ I wished that I could fly away ♪

103
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,350
♪ Instead of kneeling in the sand ♪

104
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,490
♪ Catching teardrops in my hand ♪

105
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,370
♪ My heart is drenched in wine ♪

106
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:57,760
♪ But you'll be on my mind Forever ♪

107
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,420
Mom.

108
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,290
Well, there's my girl.

109
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,130
I don't want to see you.

110
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,810
But I haven't seen you in years.

111
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,430
Don't run away from me.

112
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,520
- Can we talk? - Since I don't want to see you,

113
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,590
it follows that I don't want to hear from you, either.

114
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,990
I just came in to get antibiotics.

115
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,860
My surgeon doesn't work on Fridays.

116
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,360
It feels fine.

117
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,640
Sorry, it's not fine.

118
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,890
This implant is definitely infected.

119
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,520
Just that one, though, right?

120
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,180
Yes. At this point,

121
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,550
your butt lift, tummy tuck, lipo, and breast augmentation

122
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,950
appear to be healthy.

123
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,120
But I need to remove this one and clean the area

124
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,730
before the bacteria spreads.

125
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,130
Well, can you replace it?

126
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,050
Once the infection is resolved

127
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,430
and you have a few months to heal.

128
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,550
I don't want to walk around with half of a face for a few months.

129
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,800
Isn't there anything you can do to save the implant?

130
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,430
I can't make any guarantees,

131
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,640
but if I can replace the implant without risking re-infection,

132
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,440
I will.

133
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,660
Okay, Doctor.

134
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,090
I didn't understand the lyrics, but I liked your mom's voice.

135
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,290
Is she a professional singer?

136
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,080
She is a lot of things.

137
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,280
Great mom wasn't one of them.

138
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,350
How so?

139
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,940
A lot of people have issues with their parents, nothing new.

140
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,580
But everyone's story's different.

141
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,490
How so?

142
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,820
When I was in high school,

143
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,330
I babysat the kids in my neighborhood.

144
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,580
I wanted to buy a laptop for school

145
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,110
like a lot of my friends had,

146
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,020
so I saved up 1,000 bucks.

147
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,660
I came home one day,

148
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,680
and the money was gone and so was my mother.

149
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,810
And three days later,

150
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,870
she came back from Reno

151
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,020
with a designer dress and a guy named Ricky.

152
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,170
I never got the laptop.

153
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,930
My mom made pancakes.

154
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,640
They were good.

155
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,750
What is that?

156
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,450
I've never seen anything like that.

157
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,520
Maybe a spinal column tumor.

158
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,010
Hunter's initial spinal cord injury

159
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,450
from the motorcycle accident

160
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,080
that caused his paralysis was at T1,

161
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,190
but that part looks almost completely normal now.

162
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,880
Hunter's phantom pain is real.

163
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,620
My former mentor, Sonya Kung,

164
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,020
is head of the surgical residency program at Denver Memorial Hospital.

165
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,860
If you want a meeting, I'll make the call.

166
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,450
Why?

167
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,630
You're gonna need a job after this year.

168
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,460
You just trying to screw with my head,

169
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,130
or are you actually being serious?

170
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,930
The opportunity is real.

171
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,330
I'm trying to be nice.

172
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,920
I do that when it doesn't hurt me.

173
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,430
And this definitely doesn't hurt you,

174
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,200
you getting rid of some competition.

175
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,860
True, although you're not high on my list of threats.

176
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,060
This would be a much bigger benefit for you.

177
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,590
Look, I fought to stay here.

178
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,500
I'm not going anywhere.

179
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,390
It's very rare, but after many years

180
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,920
with a bruised cord like yours that isn't severed,

181
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,720
it can start to function again.

182
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,580
So, this mass is causing Hunter's pain?

183
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,500
Yes.

184
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,640
If the cord is healthy,

185
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,610
why aren't I feeling more than pain?

186
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,650
The mass is compressing the healthy cord,

187
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,100
just letting the pain through.

188
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,970
We still have to do some more advanced imaging to map the mass,

189
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,000
but I am fairly confident

190
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,240
that if we removed it that could change.

191
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,070
You may be able to walk again.

192
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,890
We were able to clean out the infection

193
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,700
and swap in a new implant. I am very pleased.

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,720
You think it looks okay?

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
I love it, and you are going to look great at the beach.

196
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,330
Wailea?

197
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,490
We went there on our honeymoon.

198
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,800
Thank you.

199
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,410
He's taking you to Hawaii. You should be hugging him.

200
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,350
Oh, I'm so relieved.

201
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,610
Satisfied customers --

202
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,490
This is why cosmetics is the most fun specialty.

203
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,480
Now, we're gonna monitor you closely.

204
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,500
There is a risk the infection could have seeded to other implants.

205
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,580
Keep me posted.

206
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,460
Yes, Chief.

207
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,740
I'll take the early shift.

208
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,490
Once I'm on my feet, I'm never sitting down again.

209
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,540
I'm gonna take Cora dancing.

210
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,920
She's a great dancer.

211
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,770
Oh, no.

212
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,420
I push myself.

213
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,920
No offense. It's my rule.

214
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,070
Right.

215
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,520
If this works,

216
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,430
after a considerable amount of physical therapy

217
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,040
you may be able to walk,

218
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,530
but that doesn't mean you'll be a very good dancer.

219
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,960
After years of atrophy from not moving your legs,

220
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,790
you will likely be very bad.

221
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,940
You know what the worst part is?

222
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,910
It isn't being in the chair.

223
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,600
It's that people see the chair first.

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,170
They don't see me.

225
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,380
You know what I'm talking about.

226
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,350
Why would I know what you're talking about?

227
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,220
My brother-in-law's on the spectrum.

228
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,450
So's my assistant.

229
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,250
I make it a priority of hiring people with disabilities.

230
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,400
Let me guess --

231
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,560
When you first started working here,

232
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,510
- no one believed in you. -They didn't know me.

233
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,190
They didn't know that I was going to make a good surgeon.

234
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,070
No.

235
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,980
You were different.

236
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,230
I guarantee you every other doctor

237
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,280
started with a basic level of respect.

238
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,370
It's implied they're competent.

239
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,320
We waste our time and energy trying to prove that we belong.

240
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,490
I'm fine.

241
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,120
She's just being thorough, honey.

242
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,820
You've been over my body three times.

243
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,870
Early infections often mimic blemishes.

244
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,250
It pays to be thorough.

245
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,740
Is this sore?

246
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,100
Maybe a little.

247
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,120
What's wrong?

248
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,170
It could be nothing,

249
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,510
or it could be a carbuncle, an early sign of infection.

250
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,880
Dr. Andrews needs to have a look at this.

251
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,080
This varicocele is raising testicular temperature

252
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,050
and causing your sperm count to be low.

253
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,110
Surgically, I go in, ligate the varicocele

254
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,130
and re-check your numbers in a few weeks.

255
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,190
It's done under a local,

256
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,240
so no anesthesia risks, minimal blood loss.

257
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,410
There's a risk of low testosterone and impotence,

258
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,660
but recovery time's usually a week at most.

259
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,940
So, I could have kids, I just might not be able to make them?

260
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,830
As I said, it's low risk.

261
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,040
I only mention it because I'm obligated to inform you.

262
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,950
Well, you're obligated to inform me because it's a risk.

263
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,730
It's an unlikely complication, but, yes, it happens.

264
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,010
It's outpatient.

265
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,910
I do it right here in the office.

266
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,210
What I see here is a chance to fix a problem.

267
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,210
And I see a chance to create a new one.

268
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,900
I'm -- I'm sorry, I have to go. I have a patient.

269
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,780
Look, I see a lot of men with this issue.

270
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,710
Sure, they come in because they want kids,

271
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,520
but I think what they really want is to reaffirm themselves.

272
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,270
And that's a good thing.

273
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,520
Thank you.

274
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,230
It's a spinal arachnoid meningioma.

275
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,990
Have you seen one of these before?

276
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,850
Much smaller.

277
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,670
They usually don't get this big

278
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,880
because the pain and weakness

279
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,060
brings the patient into the E.R. fast.

280
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,870
But in this case, no pain,

281
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,830
no E.R. Visit until it got this big.

282
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,530
And it's wrapped around the spinal cord tightly

283
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,210
and fused with the dura.

284
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,910
Can we get a fiber-optic laser and take it out in segments?

285
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,440
No, I don't think so.

286
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,130
It stopped growing and settled in this position.

287
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,510
But I do think that we can dissect

288
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,970
along the subarachnoid plane

289
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,680
down to the largest segment at T2

290
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,910
and remove it in one piece.

291
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,490
That's an extension of the mass.

292
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,040
Mm, no. It's the medullary pyramids.

293
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,720
No. It's an extension of the mass.

294
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,820
The pyramids are more central and the color is wrong.

295
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,610
Murphy's right.

296
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,390
The extension's tightly adhered to the brainstem.

297
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,190
Who caught it?

298
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,430
Jared did.

299
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:52,850
Nice work.

300
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,940
Most first-year residents would have missed this.

301
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,370
It's very small on the surface,

302
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,460
but I can feel the fluctuance under the skin.

303
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,730
What do we need to do to fix it?

304
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,930
We need to remove all of the implants

305
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,210
and some of the healthy underlying tissue as well.

306
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,890
Unfortunately, it will cause significant permanent scarring.

307
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,790
No, no, no, you -- you can't do that.

308
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,440
I'll look worse than I did before.

309
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,800
I-I don't get it. You removed the bad part from her face,

310
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,560
and it's fixed -- - looks good, no more infection.

311
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,340
Let's just do the same with the rest of 'em.

312
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,470
It's not that simple.

313
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,110
When we removed the infection from Emma's cheek,

314
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,010
it was under the pretense it was a localized issue.

315
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,560
If we just take out the infection from the new area,

316
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,730
it could jump again.

317
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,090
I won't do it.

318
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,260
When an infection spreads, it often moves very quickly.

319
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:39,550
What Dr. Andrews is saying --

320
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,380
I understand what he's saying.

321
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,250
I'm 50 years old.

322
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,190
When I went to drop my daughter off at Michigan,

323
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,670
we went to that bar on Liberty Street,

324
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,610
where we first met.

325
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,310
I saw myself sitting there 25 years ago --

326
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:02,060
young, confident, full of potential.

327
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,770
Then you raise a kid

328
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:12,100
and look after your husband, a home.

329
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,970
You lose touch with who you were.

330
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,710
You -- you said it was an infection, right?

331
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,020
Like strep throat or something.

332
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,780
That's what antibiotics are for.

333
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,690
Couldn't we just use that?

334
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,430
We could try strong, broad-spectrum antibiotics,

335
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,970
but I really don't want to do that.

336
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,580
You could become septic.

337
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,720
You could die.

338
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,620
It'll work. It has to.

339
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,480
The brainstem is complex.

340
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,400
Even our best imaging can't provide a complete picture.

341
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,540
So, then, you would just leave the cyst in him?

342
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,660
Other than the pain, it's not harming Hunter.

343
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,530
It's stabilized now and done growing.

344
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,670
But what about the pain?

345
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,700
An implanted nerve inhibitor will completely remove the pain.

346
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,710
But I won't be able to walk.

347
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,260
No.

348
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,930
Exactly how risky is removing the mass from the brainstem?

349
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,940
Everything that - keeps your heart beating and you breathing is right there.

350
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,870
The nerve inhibitor is a day procedure.

351
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,190
You'd sleep in your bed tonight pain-free.

352
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,240
Give me a percentage on this thing.

353
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,650
Don't do this to yourself.

354
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,230
I don't like to give those kinds of numbers.

355
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,420
They're population-based,

356
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,780
and they don't apply to your exact circumstance.

357
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,430
I understand how statistics work.

358
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,770
But there's a number, and it's relevant.

359
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,240
There's a 15% chance the surgery would kill you.

360
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,960
I remember the moment I accepted I'd never walk again.

361
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,620
It wasn't when Dr. Melendez told me after the accident.

362
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,670
It was a few months later when I was in rehab

363
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,400
and I was trying to get up in the standing frame.

364
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,070
I looked out the window

365
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,130
and there's all these people just living their lives.

366
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,350
I was trying to fix something that I can't change,

367
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,100
and life was going on without me.

368
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,260
So I started living again.

369
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,360
But now there's something I can do.

370
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,490
Hunter...

371
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,290
I want to talk to Dr. Melendez.

372
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,820
No.

373
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,000
Please.

374
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,010
Just go get Dr. Melendez.

375
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,000
You curious?

376
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,750
About why I gave you the credit?

377
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,730
I assume you thought it was a set-up,

378
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,350
that Andrews thought you were wrong

379
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,580
and you tried to throw it on me.

380
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,600
That's very cynical.

381
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,480
The other alternative is that you were being kind,

382
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,110
which seems very unlikely.

383
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,670
There is a third possibility.

384
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm proving a point.

385
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,500
When you lose their respect, no matter what you do,

386
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,020
no matter how many wins you chalk up,

387
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,490
you'll never get it back.

388
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,170
The game's already over.

389
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,610
You lost.

390
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,840
Does anyone like you?

391
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,610
I like me.

392
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,380
I've got results.

393
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,660
I know this is her first cycle of antibiotics,

394
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,370
but I'm not seeing any improvement.

395
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,370
Her neutrophils are through the roof.

396
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,340
You'd be under anesthesia for nine hours,

397
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,180
and I'll need to make sure that your body's healthy enough

398
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,210
to handle the stress.

399
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,650
Will you tell him not to do this, please?

400
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,020
You don't care what I think?

401
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,210
I'm the one in the chair.

402
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,740
You have no idea what that's like.

403
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,050
I'm right there with you.

404
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,100
Who carries you up the stairs?

405
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,240
Who pushes you out through the sand

406
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,790
so you can put your feet in the water?

407
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,480
Well, this way you won't have to do those things anymore.

408
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,350
So you just want to gamble the life that you have

409
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,390
for the life that you had?

410
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,350
Cora.

411
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,080
We have a great life,

412
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,010
but I want to walk again --

413
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,610
and I want you to see me walk.

414
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,530
I'm not gonna stand by and watch you die.

415
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,690
If you want to selfishly gamble your life away,

416
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,830
you're doing it on your own.

417
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,780
I'm doing this for us.

418
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,400
No, you're doing this for you.

419
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,890
She'll be back.

420
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,740
Dr. Tolles to Obstetrics, please.

421
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,070
Dr. Tolles to Obstetrics.

422
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,090
Hey. Uh, I got a page?

423
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,860
I'm busy, and I don't like being tricked into coming down here.

424
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,860
- Yeah, I know you hate me -- - I don't hate you.

425
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,670
Seeing you is not healthy for me.

426
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,620
Okay, wait -- Well, I just need to tell you that I was sick.

427
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,640
I am sick.

428
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,630
I know, you've been telling me that for years.

429
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,780
You were right.

430
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,960
I got help.

431
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,600
They have me on mood stabilizers.

432
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,370
I'm doing better now.

433
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,140
I mean, sometimes the meds make me feel flat.

434
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,200
You know, no highs, no fun.

435
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,020
No lows, though, either.

436
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,080
It's worth it.

437
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,960
I'd like to try again to be your mom.

438
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,140
I mean, maybe we could just talk some more?

439
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,960
I'll think about it.

440
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,460
Well, take these.

441
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,410
They need water or they're gonna die.

442
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,330
My number's on the card.

443
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,030
I think I just won the Tour de France.

444
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,280
It's a long surgery.

445
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,590
It will put a lot of strain on your heart.

446
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,010
Your cardiovascular fitness is excellent.

447
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,100
You get it, right?

448
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,860
Get what?

449
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,180
Why I want this surgery so bad.

450
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,580
You'd jump at a cure for autism, wouldn't ya?

451
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,190
There isn't a cure for autism.

452
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,700
Well, last week I didn't think there was a surgery to help me.

453
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,400
The surgery isn't guaranteed to help you walk.

454
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,760
Why would you risk losing a person who accepts you the way you are?

455
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,370
You may not find another one.

456
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,270
There are a lot of reasons to marry me, you know?

457
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,570
I'm sure there are a lot of reasons to marry you.

458
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,490
Yes. I'm organized, I have excellent visual-spatial memory,

459
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,140
and Lea says I'm refreshingly honest and fair.

460
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,960
I suppose Cora loves me because I'm determined...

461
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,940
I'm pretty smart,

462
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,800
committed to helping others,

463
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,640
and most of all, probably because I'm patient.

464
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,480
Were you always those things?

465
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,900
Were you those things before you were in the wheelchair?

466
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,460
Your autism helped you -- That's your point.

467
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,710
You're saying this chair made me a better person.

468
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,290
The difference is losing this chair now

469
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,630
won't make me lose the lessons it gave me.

470
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,450
The antibiotics aren't working.

471
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,980
I told if they didn't we'd be doing surgery next.

472
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,920
No.

473
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,160
She's going to die if we don't act now.

474
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,310
Honey, we need to listen to the doctors.

475
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,560
I need you to trust me.

476
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,040
I can't go back to being like it used to be.

477
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,570
You don't have a choice.

478
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,310
She wants a second opinion.

479
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,040
She's going to die.

480
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,000
I told her that.

481
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:30,900
Sometimes it's tough to actually get out of those doors.

482
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,050
When I was a kid,

483
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,730
my little sister had an accident climbing a tree --

484
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,790
a traumatic brain injury --

485
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,650
and I woke up every morning dreaming that she was better,

486
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,710
but she wasn't.

487
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,180
I took care of her a lot --

488
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,110
brushed her teeth, combed her hair, fed her.

489
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,110
Hunter was my first patient as an attending,

490
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,680
and I had to walk in that room and tell him

491
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,410
that there was nothing I could do for him,

492
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,720
nothing I could do to fix him.

493
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,880
And now there is?

494
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,870
But there's no guarantee.

495
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,790
There is never a guarantee.

496
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:33,020
I'm sorry, but I can't risk losing the man that I fell in love with.

497
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,950
You're not just afraid that the surgery will kill him.

498
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,870
You're afraid that it might work.

499
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,440
You've only known Hunter in a wheelchair.

500
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,220
Walking would be a fundamental change in who he is --

501
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,830
a fundamental change in who you are as a couple.

502
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,800
You're worried that no matter what happens,

503
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
you're gonna lose him.

504
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,810
Hunter seems to have a great life.

505
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,690
I don't know if I'd risk giving that up.

506
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,510
What if there was an operation to make you a perfect doctor,

507
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,750
never make a mistake, 

508
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,110
but it had a, you know, 5% of killing you?

509
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,020
Would you do it?

510
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,070
That's not a fair comparison.

511
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,460
Well, you said Hunter's doing fine the way he is,

512
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,580
but we're talking about giving him something more.

513
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,760
What about 2%?

514
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,670
I don't think - there's a number for me.

515
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,930
Oh, of course there's a number.

516
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,720
Every time you get in your car --

517
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,930
Hell, every time you leave your home

518
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,560
you take a risk - something bad could happen.

519
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,880
But you do it anyway,

520
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,160
you know, to make yourself better,

521
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,440
to make the world better,

522
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,330
sometimes just to have fun.

523
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,840
Sometimes to go to a carnival.

524
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,300
Kenny's not your friend.

525
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,950
He's using you.

526
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,280
I...don't think so.

527
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,610
We have fun.

528
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,960
He's got a rap sheet.

529
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,450
Mostly misdemeanors,

530
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,100
but there's a couple felony theft cases

531
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,780
that were bargained down.

532
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,180
Wait, you ran a background check on Kenny?

533
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,150
Well, you start by talking, I start by gathering evidence.

534
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,670
I'll forward it to you.

535
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,110
In my experience, there are only two reasons

536
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,890
why a married person has this kind of cosmetic surgery.

537
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,170
Either you're halfway out the door or she is.

538
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,780
Emma loves me.

539
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,500
That's what I figured.

540
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,560
The antibiotics aren't working,

541
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,950
so your wife is going to die

542
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,850
unless you get in there and you convince her

543
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,920
that she doesn't need any of this cosmetic surgery

544
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,700
because you are a faithful, loving husband.

545
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,350
How's the pain?

546
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,080
You know, I think the adrenaline

547
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,100
of actually doing this is helping.

548
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,950
It's the oxycodone.

549
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,590
That's good.

550
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,420
I'm glad you came back.

551
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,360
I never left.

552
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,470
I don't want to do this without you.

553
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,540
I don't want to do anything without you.

554
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,060
If you can walk,

555
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,170
you'll be different.

556
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,680
You won't need me anymore.

557
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,650
You think I married you

558
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,790
'cause I was having trouble hanging clothes in my closet?

559
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,650
You're my girl.

560
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,010
I will always need you.

561
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,360
Even if I could fly,

562
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,030
who's gonna remind me to call my mom on her birthday...

563
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,570
or to floss? God, I hate flossing.

564
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,360
Who's gonna remind me to be a better person?

565
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,570
Who's gonna hold my hand when I'm scared?

566
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,000
That was nice.

567
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,120
You have to have the surgery.

568
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,150
You were distant before.

569
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,270
Since the surgery, - you can't get enough of me.

570
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,940
It worked.

571
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,760
You're happy, I'm happy.

572
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,350
I love you. I always have loved you.

573
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,510
- I always will. - You stopped loving me.

574
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,550
No. Never.

575
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,140
If you were in love with me,

576
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,900
you never would've cheated on me.

577
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,960
Barry, please, 

578
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,350
no more lies.

579
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,290
You were never home. We never talked.

580
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,350
You were never there.

581
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,790
There was never another woman.

582
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,610
I was gambling -- a lot.

583
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,980
I did it because I was ashamed of the man that I'd become.

584
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,740
When we got married, I promised you the world,

585
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,060
and instead I gave you a mediocre life.

586
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,160
When I was up, - 

587
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,770
it made me feel like a winner.

588
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,400
And I was too embarrassed to let you see me like that,

589
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,780
so I hid it from you.

590
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,080
She's gonna do the surgery.

591
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,480
Thank you.

592
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,220
Andrews needs an O.R. for Emma Newton.

593
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,810
Claire, you're beautiful, smart, 

594
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,210
and very good at your job.

595
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,040
Thank you, Shaun.

596
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,350
That's a very sweet thing to say.

597
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,700
Would you ever date someone with a disability?

598
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,030
Yeah, sure.

599
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,030
You could choose the ideal mate, Claire.

600
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,760
Why would you want the unnecessary burden?

601
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,310
Everyone is dealing with something.

602
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:04,120
We just have to love other people for who they are

603
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,270
and hope they love us, too.

604
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,480
O.R. 1's prepped for Hunter.

605
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,980
I'll join you in a minute.

606
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,050
So, what changed her mind?

607
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,790
Jared did.

608
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,420
Morgan, you're my first assist.

609
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:56,580
Make the call.

610
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,960
Thanks.

611
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,780
This is as far as you can go.

612
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,770
Nurse Matthews will take you to the waiting room.

613
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:15,170
Can I, uh -- Can I give him a kiss?

614
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,580
Of course.

615
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,620
I can't do this.

616
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,930
Yes, you can.

617
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,550
This is what you do in a relationship, right?

618
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:38,080
You take chances, together.

619
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,330
Okay.

620
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,110
That's a large tissue defect in the left breast.

621
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,870
If we'd been in here six hours ago,

622
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,120
I could have salvaged more underlying muscle tissue.

623
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,970
I'm noticing her heart rate jump.

624
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,240
You seeing that, J.L.?

625
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,890
I am now.

626
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,450
How's her surgical sites?

627
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:16,930
I'm not seeing any bleeding.

628
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,050
Morgan, what about your side?

629
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,410
Everything looks good here.

630
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,600
Maybe the anesthesia's light?

631
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,580
Nope. No, something's definitely happening.

632
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,840
Jared's right.

633
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,870
Suction, Claire.

634
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,200
Give me a 25 on a 130.

635
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,970
All right, Murphy, I want you to cut right under my forceps

636
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,420
very carefully.

637
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,580
Section's cut.

638
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,250
How are the motor evoked potentials?

639
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,250
Signal's coming through --

640
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:49,060
spinal cord's functioning normally.

641
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,190
The mass has fully encased the medullary cord.

642
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,900
Give me the ferromagnetic wand.

643
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,710
I can't get the caudal end clear of the underlying cord.

644
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,080
Got a big drop in potentials.

645
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,440
We are compressing his brainstem.

646
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,340
- What's his pressure? - Mean arterial pressure's 70.

647
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,220
I got nothing now.

648
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,390
Push IV fluids. Keep that MAP above 90.

649
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,250
Hunter's going into neurogenic shock.

650
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,530
We need to stop the surgery.

651
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,600
I'm almost there. 20 seconds.

652
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,730
Pressure's 60. Push vasopressors.

653
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,960
The last piece is right there.

654
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,590
It's probably edema. Push 100 of dexamethasone.

655
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,380
Still nothing.

656
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,020
He's dying.

657
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,260
It's one damn centimeter of tissue...

658
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,790
All clear.

659
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,300
That's her second dose of amiodarone.

660
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,430
She's not responding.

661
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,250
She's thrown her septic embolism.

662
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,520
I'm cracking her chest.

663
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,980
10 joules. Clear.

664
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,380
Again.

665
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,600
Clear.

666
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,540
Starting cardiac massage.

667
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,280
It's time to call it.

668
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,090
Time of death, 10:23.

669
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,910
We'll send pecialists to work with you.

670
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,200
The first will be a neurophysiatrist --

671
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,310
Thank you. Thank you.

672
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,050
Thank you. I'm grateful to all of you.

673
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,720
Would you mind if we talked about the rest of this later?

674
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,690
I just want to sit with my wife.

675
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,660
Thank you.

676
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,850
I met a couple today that lost their way.

677
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,190
They loved each other,

678
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,520
but by the time they remembered what really mattered,

679
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,600
it was too late.

680
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,450
I don't want us to be like them.

681
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,810
I want to be fully committed to you.

682
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,230
I love you, too.

683
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:21,110
There's a surgery I could have that should make me fertile,

684
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,390
but there's a risk of impotency.

685
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,460
What do you want to do?

686
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,180
I want to give you what you want,

687
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,850
what we want, a family.

688
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,150
We are a family.

689
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,770
Yes, I want children,

690
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,180
and there are many ways to do that,

691
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,230
which we'll explore together.

692
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,750
But I draw the line at anything that risks our sex life.

693
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,190
It's just one night a week,

694
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,490
but I think this could be my big break, you know?

695
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,930
Well, you always had a beautiful voice.

696
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,730
Well, everyone's got one thing, right?

697
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,040
But enough about me. I want to hear about you.

698
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,100
Do you have a man?

699
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,600
I did.

700
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,280
Pretty young thing - should have plenty of choices.

701
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,700
I'm not looking to complicate my life right now.

702
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,570
Still looking after - everyone else but yourself,

703
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,820

750
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,490
Plain white rice?

751
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,960
{\an9}♪ No time ♪

752
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:55,820
I got a gaming console,

753
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,710
and I hooked it up to your bad boy over there.

754
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,320
We can play some "Mortal Kombat."

755
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,620
Come on.

756
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,220
{\an9}♪ No time ♪

757
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,210
We doing this or what?

758
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,440
It sounds fun.

759
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,670
Yeah, there you go.

760
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,640
This one's you.

761
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,150
That's you on the left right there.

762
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,670
- Okay. - Yeah.

763
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,150
You got four arms, but you're naked, so here we go.

764
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,040
I gave you a pneumothorax.

765
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,840
Ah, I didn't realize how bloody this game was.

766
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,660
Ooh, a fireball. I got you there.

767
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,860
Have you played this before?

768
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,800
That looks like a spinal fracture.

769
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,930
Yeah, I'd say -- I'd say there's a huge fracture there.

770
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,080
You died.
