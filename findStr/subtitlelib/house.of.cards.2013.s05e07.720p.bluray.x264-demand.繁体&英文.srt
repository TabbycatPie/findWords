您知道嗎
Were you aware?

30
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,440
大家就問到這里吧
Uh, no further questions, everybody.

31

州長還要和國會議員們會面

Well, it doesn't.

36

你根本不明白  是吧
You have no idea, do you?

37
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,720
你在這里沒有分量了
No one hears you walking the halls of this building...

38
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,370
現在沒有了

He's here. In the Kremlin.

50

如果我們遂了他的愿
If we give him what he wants...

51
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,420
如果我們按厄舍的意思任命法官  那就完了
If we give Usher what he says, his justice, that is it.

52
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,800
徹底完了  我們就被他拿住了
It's over. He owns us.

53
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,500
-別小題大做  -是倒好了
- Don't exaggerate. - I wish I were.

54
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,270
這樣的交易你做過上千次了
You've made a thousand deals.

55
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,740
這次不一樣
Yeah, well, this one is different.

56
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,520
-怎么不一樣  -因為我能感覺到
- Why? - Because I can feel it right here.

57
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,900
-你聽見自己在說什么了嗎  -清清楚楚
- Do you hear yourself? - Yeah, loud and clear.

58
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,370
我倒有點奇怪你似乎一個字都沒聽見
I'm a little confused that you don't seem to hear me at all.

59
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,130
只要我們真正奪回權力
Once we're solidly back in power,

60
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,110
-我們就能恢復職位...  -幼稚
- we will regain our position... - That is naive.

61
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,700
你從來沒這么幼稚過
Naive is new for you.

62
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,920
我這是現實  不是幼稚
Realistic. Not naive.

63
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,120
我們奮斗的一切成果  都會煙消云散
Everything we've worked for, we can kiss it goodbye.

64
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,820
我們同意讓厄舍來挑人  沒得商量
We agreed to Usher's pick. It's non-negotiable.

65
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,590
說得太對了  他挑人  他的法官
That's exactly right. It's his pick. It's his justice.

66
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,850
他想控制我們的政府  我們的白宮
He's trying to control our house. The White House.

67
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,330
我向他保證過了  弗蘭西斯
I gave him my word, Francis.

68
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,090
你保證
Your word?

69
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,390
你保證  這場談話真是毫無意義
Your word? This conversation is pointless.

70
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,660
成熟點吧
Grow up!

71
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,130
你以為你是誰
Who do you think you are?

72
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,220
我以為我是臨時代總統
I think I am a temporary president

73
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,710
想幫你奪回寶座
trying to get you back in office.

74
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,820
如果你不認為眼下是我們至關重要的關口
And if you don't think that we're at a critical juncture in the road,

75
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,100
那你真是錯得可悲
you are pathetically mistaken.

76
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,790
醒醒吧  克萊爾  醒醒吧
Wake up, Claire! Wake up!

看來他在劍橋期間喜歡上吃巧克力了
Seems he developed a taste for chocolate while at Cambridge.

80
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,200
畫面上這位是艾哈邁德·艾哈邁迪
Smiling for the camera is Ahmed Al Ahmadi,

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,540
尤瑟夫的兄弟
Yusuf's brother.

82
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,120
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,110
我和尤瑟夫·艾哈邁迪談了很久
I had a long conversation with Yusuf Al Ahmadi.

84
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,720
他們倆完全不像
They look nothing alike.

85
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,500
就是他
It's him.

86
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,700
艾哈邁德還在我們監控中嗎
Is Ahmed still in our sights?

87
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,130
-是的  -這個機會非常難得
- He is. - This is a rare opportunity.

88
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,140
我們應該趁機發動定點襲擊
We should seize the moment and make a targeted strike.

89
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,350
-總監  得了吧  -總統女士
- Director, please. - Madam President...

90
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,710
有什么問題嗎  將軍
Is there some issue, General?

91
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,240
艾哈邁德·艾哈邁迪不可能大老遠地
Ahmed Al Ahmadi didn't travel all the way

92
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
從他的據點跑到大馬士革就為了買糖吃
from his compound to Damascus to buy a candy bar.

93
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,250
他肯定要見什么人  我們應該查清是誰
He's meeting with someone. Let's find out who.

94
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,000
可這樣他可能會被我們驚動  就此消失
Unless we're detected, and he disappears for good.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,260
可我們只要等一等
But if we wait,

96
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,160
就非常有可能了解更多哈里發國的情報
there's a huge potential to learn more about ICO.

97
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,310
它的成員  聯系人  行動規律和戰術
Its members, contacts, habits, tactics.

98
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,590
你今天早上真是一反常態地
You know, you're sounding uncharacteristically dovish

99
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,170
保守啊  將軍
this morning, General.

100
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,260
我同意布雷格將軍的看法
I agree with General Braegher.

101
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,050
雖然對艾哈邁迪發動精確空襲
While a successful air strike against Ahmadi

102
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,950
-會非常有利于  -這跟選舉無關  凱茜
- would play well... - This isn't about the election, Cathy.

103
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,670
當然沒關系  我是說  只要我們手段得當
No, of course not. I mean, if we do this correctly,

104
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,680
我們就可以逐步瓦解哈里發國的網絡
we can begin the process of dismantling ICO's network.

105
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,950
干掉他
Take him out.

106
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,010
如果總統同意的話
If the president agrees,

107
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,220
我認為這對國家最有利
I think it's the best thing for the country.

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,730
我覺得這會給哈里發國發出非常明確的信號
Well, I think it would send a very clear message to ICO.

109
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,300
短期來看沒錯  但是
In the short term, yes, but...

110
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,160
短期沒錯就夠了
No other term is relevant.

111
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,840
我覺得我們已經在
I think we have been operating

112
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,020
恐怖主義的陰影下忍受太久了
under the shadow of terror for too long.

113
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,870
為了美國人民  我們必須采取堅決行動
For the sake of the American people, we need to act now.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,740
預計需要多長時間  將軍
What's the timetable, General?

115
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,420
只要目標位置準確  幾個小時就行
For an actionable location, most likely a number of hours.

116
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,860
謝謝
Thank you.

117
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,250
你這是在浪費我們的時間
You're wasting our time.

118
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,370
我們要講究他在哪以何種面貌出現
We're being selective about where and how he appears.

119
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,970
很快他就什么活動都不能參加了
Soon he won't be at any events at all.

120
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:14,400
漢娜  我們只是想盡力把他和你送入白宮
Hannal, we're just trying to land him and you in the White House.

121
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,550
不是布洛哈特-康威  馬克  是康威在前
And it's not Brockhart-Conway, Mark. It's the opposite.

122
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,560
他肯定忍不了多久
He won't put up with this much longer.

123
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,690
我知道他一定很難受
I know, I'm sure it's hard on him.

124
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,960
我得接這個電話  抱歉
I have to take this. I'm sorry.

125
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,910
他到那兒之后會怎么樣
What happens after he gets there?

126
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,200
-威爾會怎么樣  -我們會支持他
- To Will? What happens? - We'll be there for him.

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,600
-你和布洛哈特將軍  -對
- You and General Brockhart? - Yes.

128
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,230
威爾是什么角色
What will Will's role be?

129
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,470
我會繼續支持你丈夫
I will continue to support your husband.

130
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,110
給我一個真正的答案  你欠我的
Give me a real answer. You owe me that.

131
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,740
他的角色將是美國總統
His role will be President of the United States.

132
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,880
麥克風還開著  布洛哈特脫口而出
The mic was still hot and Brockhart just kept talking.

133
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,210
-她是這么說的  -抗命嗎
- That's what she said. - Insubordination?

134
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,010
-她用的是這個詞嗎  -她聽著是這意思
- That's the word she used? - It's what it sounded like to her.

135
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,200
他在談士兵  他說
He was talking about soldiers and he said, quote,

136
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,560
"我第一個站出來讓軍人抗命"
"I'll be the first to tell them not to listen."

137
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,460
-她能不能弄到真正的錄音  -是有代價的
- Can she get her hands on the actual clip? - For a price.

138
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,070
-我還以為她是朋友  -對  聰明的朋友
- I thought she was a friend. - Yeah, a smart friend.

139
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,680
這是一條很不錯的辯論后30秒廣告
It's a nice 30-second spot, post-debate.

140
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,020
如果有辯論的話
If there is a debate.

141
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,920
攻擊他們的長處
Hits them at their strength.

142
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,610
動搖他們的軍事公信力
Takes the military credibility away.

143
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,370
這種東西能反轉大選結果
This is the kind of thing that can turn an election.

144
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,280
不管要付出什么代價  都值了
Whatever this costs... it's worth it.

145
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,710
我們把它搞到手  證實一下
Let's secure it and then verify it.

146
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,300
不管是不是休會任命本森大法官
Recess appointment of Judge Benson or no,

147
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,970
得讓人們繼續關注田納西和俄亥俄的重新投票
people need to stay focused on the revote in Tennessee and Ohio

148
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,680
以及我們為何走到這一步
and how the hell we got here.

149
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,120
好
All right.

150
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,390
我讓助理安吉拉聯系你
I'll have my assistant Angela reach out

151
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,620
看你什么時候需要我去錄影棚
to confirm what time you need me at the studio.

152
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,620
好  好的
All right. Yep. Yeah.

153
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,510
我把道格·斯坦普被劫車那天
I collected everything I could find

154
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,890
能查到的資料都搜集齊了
about the day Doug Stamper was carjacked.

155
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,050
好
Good.

156
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,790
好了  那么
All right, so...

157
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,840
是在哪
where was that?

158
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,530
在哪發生的
Where that happened?

159
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,720
在馬里蘭
In Maryland.

160
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,290
就在
Right around, um...

161
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,080
我是在離那兒半小時車程的地方長大的
Yeah, I grew up about a half an hour from there...

162
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,450
在這里
It's here.

163
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,840
瑞秋·波斯納的
And Rachel Posner's...

164
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,190
最后已知地址
last known address.

165
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,910
也就15分鐘路程
I'd say they were about 15 minutes apart.

166
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,660
我不知道我為什么要跟你解釋
I'm not sure why I need to explain myself to you.

167
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,100
你為什么要去國安局
Why would you go to the NSA?

168
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,970
我想調查一名美國公民是否安然無恙
I was inquiring into the well-being of an American citizen.

169
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,370
他就是個心懷不滿的黑客而已
He's just a disgruntled hacker.

170
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,560
那你為什么對他這么感興趣呢
Then why are you so interested in him?

171
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,930
他看上去怎么樣
How did he look?

172
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,060
我是為了我自己問的
I'm asking for me.

173
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,970
我13歲就認識艾丹了
I've known Aidan since I was 13 years old.

174
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,230
他和我媽媽曾交往過幾年
He and my mom dated for several years.

175
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,700
當然  那是很久之前了
Was a long time ago, obviously.

176
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,660
但他并不想要國安局那份工作
But as far as the NSA job, he didn't want it.

177
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,990
是我逼他接受的
I made him take it.

178
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:41,120
我不明白他們怎么找到他的  他為什么在那兒
I don't understand how they got him or why he's there.

179
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,730
我需要知道他是安全的
I need to know that he is safe.

180
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,750
他看上去還行
He looked fine.

181
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,100
他知道什么  莉安
What does he know, LeAnn?

182
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,760
也許跟你我知道的差不多
Probably about the same as you and me,

183
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,350
所以我們不能讓他惹上嚴重的麻煩
which is why we need to keep him out of any serious trouble.

184
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,790
我不想涉足你的私生活  莉安
I don't want to get involved in your personal life, LeAnn.

185
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,510
-我是來見總統的  -當然
- I'm here to see the president. - Of course.

186
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,780
但你仔細想想  凱茜
But when you think about it, Cathy,

187
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,630
我們都脫不了干系
we're all sort of involved here.

188
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,830
如果他有危險  他是無法承受的
If he is in any kind of danger, he is not built for it.

189
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,190
你好  凱茜
Hi, Cathy.

190
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,100

193
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,910
很拗口
It's a mouthful.

194
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,790
很高興見到你本人
Yeah, it's good to put a face to the voice.

195
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,290
你有布洛芬嗎
Uh, do you have any ibuprofen?

196
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,280
-我好像有阿司匹林  -不行
- Oh, I might have some aspirin. - No.

197
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,780
-我過敏  會起疹子  -我們好像有
- I'm allergic. Gives me hives. - We may have some.

198
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,390
你家就是做輪胎的哈維家族  對吧
You're the Harveys of the tire company, yes?

199
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,610
我父親和叔叔二十年前賣了公司
My father and uncle sold the business 20 years ago.

200
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,010
之后胎面就不一樣了
And the treads haven't been the same since.

201
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,500
但很不錯  你還是來到了華府

202

我會告訴總統你們倆都來了

謝謝你的藥
Uh, thank you for this.

204
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,450
我們對調這兩句就行了
Let's just reverse those two sentences and it's there.

205
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,810
切中要點
It's to the point.

206
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,940

還好我們阻止了

國土安全部收到網絡司令部的消息

卡車本該從亞特蘭大

252
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,160
駛回巴爾的摩的生產廠商那里

卡車的衛星定位下線了

255

-我們得重新評估  -可是該重新評估了

但我們必須作出決定

我們應該通知特區警察和弗州州警

259

要不要疏散群眾

眼下我們還不清楚誰對這起事件負責
At this time, we have no idea who's responsible.

267
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,500
格林局長  我最好還是
Director Green, perhaps it's better

268
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,700
把你接到免提上  請稍等
I patch you into the whole room. One second.

269
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,010
自從他的輪班開始  司機就失聯了
The driver's been unreachable since his shift began.

270
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,150
卡車上的放射物
There's enough radiation on that truck

271
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,260
足夠影響方圓50公里左右的區域
to impact a 30-mile radius.

272
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,930
即便不被武器化  也會擴散到大氣中
Even if it's not weaponized, it would be in the air,

273
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,480
水里  影響兒童和平民
in the water, children, people...

274
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,820
將軍  我在這里都能聽見車輪轟轟響了
General, I can hear the wheels grinding from here.

275
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,870
最好還是不要妄加推測  先生
I'd rather not speculate, sir.

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,550
請你盡情推測一下
Oh, please do.

277
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,720
過去幾天以來  哈里發國的情報越來越多
Over the past several days, there has been increased ICO chatter,

278
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,830
但這已經是新常態了
but that is the new normal.

279
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,500
我們把可能受影響區域的地圖和數據發過去了
We've sent over stats and maps of potentially affected areas.

280
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,330
我真不知道哪個更可怕
I don't know what's worse.

281
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,100
是隨時會炸的臟彈  還是全城人知道
A dirty bomb about to go off or what'll happen to the city

282
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,510
我們在找一枚臟彈后的反應
when they know we're looking for one.

283
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,510
-上頭有誰留守  -賽斯和莉安
- Who do we have left upstairs? - Seth and LeAnn.

284
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,940
你和格林保持通信
You stay in touch with Green.

285
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,680
如果真的有臟彈
If this is a dirty bomb,

286
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,910
那局面可就徹底不一樣了
then we've just entered a different world.

287
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,250
好  先生
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,740
好了  我們繼續集中力量
All right, we need to stay focused

289
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,010
制定一份緊急疏散計劃
on our contingency plan for an evacuation

290
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,250
但不要讓外界察覺我們的行動
without the appearance of doing so.

291
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,480
我們需要準備實施單向...
We need to be ready to implement one way...

292
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,530
給我聯系能源部的清理小隊...
We need to get the cleanup team from the Energy...

293
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,060
...有權調取安保監控錄像....
...whose jurisdiction it is to get the security cams...

294
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,410
沒錯  最終宣布后
Yes. Whenever it happens,

295
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,090
這次任命便能打破最高法院的僵局
this appointment would break the court's deadlock.

296
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,430
我們終于能繼續推進這次大選了
And we would get this election going again.

297
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,530
但請大家退一步想一想
But let's step back a minute.

298
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,460
田納西已經不重要了
Tennessee is out of the equation.

299
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,050
無論誰贏下田州  都不夠取勝
Whoever wins that state, it's not enough.

300
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,630
這樣就取決于最后一個州  俄亥俄州
It's come down to one state. Ohio.

301
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,100
一個州的選擇  將左右
One state is about to choose

302
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,500
下一任美國總統的人選
the next President of these United States.

303
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,530
我們怎么會讓這種事發生
How did we let this happen?

304
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,770
而且還不止一次
And it keeps happening.

305
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,930
這屆政府一貫喜歡搞閉門政治
This is an administration that operates behind closed doors,

306
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,780
逃避公共監督
out of the public eye.

307
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,220
今天的突然推遲也是一貫的套路
Today's sudden postponement is typical.

308
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,100
玫瑰園沒發表一個字的聲明
With no announcement in the Rose Garden,

309
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,670
整個白宮也完全沒有任何消息放出
and literally zero news coming from the White House,

310
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,680
我們不得不去想  究竟發生了什么幕后驚變
one has to wonder what is going on behind the scenes

311
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,120
才導致這次意外推遲
to cause this unexpected delay.

312
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,950
白宮的沉默  振聾發聵
The silence is deafening.

313
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,650
在這樣一場曠日持久
After such a protracted,

314
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,390
令人疑惑  混亂不堪的選舉之后
confusing and, frankly, chaotic election,

315
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,090
我們有權了解真相
we deserve clarity.

316
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,350
可是  又是這樣
Instead, here we are again...

317
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,000
我們又被蒙在鼓里  神經緊張
left out of the loop and on the edge of our seats.

318
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,490
我希望美國人民不會習慣了這種現象
I just hope America isn't getting used to this.

319
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,540
-喂  -是我
- Hello? - Hey, it's me.

320
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,770
道格
Doug?

321
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,500
為什么沒人告訴我
Why wasn't I read in?

322
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,820
-告訴你什么  -正在發生的事
- To what? - Whatever's going on.

323
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,940
如果總統躲入地堡會對我們有利
If this is gonna play for us, the president in the bunker,

324
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,510
我要知道該如何操作
I need to know how to play it.

325
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,510
有一輛運送
There's a truck carrying

326
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,850
放射性物質的貨車失聯了
radioactive material that's gone missing.

327
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,710
好  賽斯和我要準備一份聲明嗎
Okay. Should Seth and I prepare a statement?

328
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,330
-我們要說貨車在哪  -不清楚
- Where are we saying the truck is? - We don't know.

329
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,930
-什么時候能找到它  -也不清楚
- When are we gonna find it? - We don't know.

330
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,020
等下  真的有事發生嗎
Wait, is something really happening?

331
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,010
可能沒有
Probably not.

332
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,660
-喂  -可能沒有
- Hello? - Probably not?

333
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,800
那我該做些什么
What am I supposed to do?

334
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,840
-是道格嗎  -是的
- Is that Doug? - Yeah.

335
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,870
我能跟他說兩句嗎
Can I talk to him?

336
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,840
-你能告訴我們什么  -表現如常
- Hey, what can you tell us? - Act normal.

337
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,920
繼續關注情勢  
Stay on point.

338
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,660
只回應正在進行的競選活動
Comment only on the ongoing campaign.

339
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,740
我已經把他們的日程活動延期了
I've already postponed their scheduled events.

340
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,140
我們現在有危險嗎
Look, are we in danger here or what?

341
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,220
我無法回答這個問題
I can't answer.

342
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,630
因為我也不知道
Because I don't know.

343
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,620
靜等國安部的進一步指示吧
Await further instructions from Homeland.

344
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,070
好吧
All right.

345
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,590
道格  我們還要留在這兒嗎
Doug, should we be here?

346
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,850
他掛了
He hung up.

347
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,970
我們在做什么
What are we doing?

348
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:59,150
諾拉覺得我們需要通知麥卡錫議長
Nora thinks we need to notify Speaker McCarthy.

349
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,190
我覺得現在談政府繼續運作為時尚早
I think it's too soon for a continuity of government.

350
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,720
如果我們計劃撤離  需要通知國會
If we're planning an evacuation, Congress needs to be notified--

351
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,020
我說了  我覺得太早了
I said, I believe it is a bit too early.

352
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,260
總統女士  莫里森總監認為...
Madam President, Director Morrison thinks that--

353
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,870
等下  莫里森總監在哪  為什么...
Wait a minute. Where is Director Morrison? Why--

354
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,470
她選擇留在國家情報總監辦公室
She opted to stay at ODNI.

355
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,750
她在那里指揮行動
She's monitoring from there.

356
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,130
至少給她打個電話
Well, at least let's get her on the phone.

357
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,680
我們早該在數月前趁有機會時鏟除哈里發國
We should have wiped out ICO when we had the chance.

358
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,310
我們沒問你的個人意見  將軍
We didn't ask for your personal opinion, General.

359
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,390
我們需要了解艾哈邁德·艾哈邁迪的最新情況
What we need is an update on the Ahmed Al Ahmadi situation.

360
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,730
是  女士  我這就去和莫里森總監確認
Yes, ma'am. I'll check with Director Morrison now.

361
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
我有一些關系
I have contacts, you know.

362
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,560
本地的私人承包商  也許能幫上忙
Private contractors in the region that might be of help.

363
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,280
你是暗示說你的聯系人
Are you suggesting that your contacts

364
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,880
比聯調局和國安局知道得還多嗎
know more than the Bureau, the NSA--

365
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,690
我沒有暗示什么
I'm not suggesting anything.

366
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,910
我是在告訴你
I'm telling you.

367
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,390
我認識和哈里發國談判過的第三方人士
I know third parties that have negotiated with ICO in the past.

368
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,870
人質之類的事  他們也許知道點什么
Hostages and whatnot... who may know something.

369
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,470
但我需要打個電話
But I need a line.

370
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,260
保密電話
Just a... a secure one.

371
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,520
我在這兒都快透不過氣了
I can barely breathe in here.

372
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,520
我去給咱們倒杯咖啡
I'm gonna go get us a cup of coffee.

373
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,260
戴維斯女士怎么會有這么高的安全等級
How does Miss Davis have this level of clearance?

374
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,190
這值得探究
That's a good question.

375
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,490
-我們是不是自作自受  -什么
- Did we bring this on ourselves? - What?

376
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,740
-對不起  我不該這么說的  -聽我說
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. - Listen to me.

377
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,740
我們所做的一切  一切  
Everything we've done, everything,

378
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,890
都是我們必須做的
is exactly what we had to do.

379
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,920
我們都還不知道這是不是真的
We don't even know if this is real.

380
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,580
這是我在香港買的
I get these in Hong Kong.

381
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,990
最好喝的速溶咖啡出自環太平洋地區
The best instant coffee comes out of the Pacific Rim.

382
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:32,430
-你想來一杯嗎  -如果你還有多的
- Would you like one? - If you can spare it.

383
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,400
我包里總是裝著三四包
Oh, I always have three or four in my bag.

384
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,170
不知我們要在這里待多久
I wonder how long we'll be down here.

385
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,950
目前情勢還不明朗
The situation's still unclear.

386
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,990
我不該喝咖啡的  我還有點站不穩
I shouldn't be drinking coffee. I still feel a little shaky.

387
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,810
你看起來還好
You don't look it.

388
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,590
摸摸我的脈搏
Feel my pulse.

389
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,100
我看你很自若
You seem very much in control to me.

390
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,990
你也是
So do you.

391
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,230
這說明了我們什么
What does that say about the two of us?

392
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,420
好的  謝謝
Yes, thank you.

393
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,980
海豹突擊隊正在追蹤艾哈邁德·艾哈邁迪
The SEAL team is on the trail of Ahmed Al Ahmadi,

394
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,800
但是國家情報局認為
but National Intelligence believes

395
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,680
他發現我們在追蹤他了
he's discovered we're following him

396
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,690
而那卡車正是對策
and the truck is a countermeasure.

397
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,290
哈里發國想看到艾哈邁迪完好地走出大馬士革
ICO wants to see Ahmadi walking out of Damascus in one piece.

398
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,470
如果我們襲擊  他們會反攻
If we strike, they will hit back.

399
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,150
需要啟動首都撤離程序
Capital-wide evacuation procedures need to be initiated--

400
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,150
-等等  -我們得首要考慮民眾
- Just hold on! - No, the public is our priority--

401
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,790
等等  我想知道襲擊的可能性有多大
Hold on! I want to know how close we are to a strike

402
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,200
以及這輛該死的卡車在哪里
and where this goddamn truck is

403
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,710
然后我們再做最后的決定
before we make any final decisions.

404
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,720
"我們再做最后的決定"
"We make any decisions"?

405
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,750
沒錯  我仍然是
Yes, I am still in a position to make--

406
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,960
如果我錯了就糾正我  但你不是
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you are not in a position--

407
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,390
諾拉  敵人不在這里
Nora. The enemy isn't in here.

408
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,540
卡弗蒂說得對  我們應該撤離
Cafferty is right. We should evacuate.

409
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,840
但我想的是將軍
But it's the general who's on my mind.

410
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,600
卡弗蒂女士
Miss Cafferty.

411
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,700
我完全失態了  請接受我的道歉
I was entirely out of line. Please accept my apology.

412
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,420
我和戴維斯談過了
I spoke with Davis.

413
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,730
-怎樣  -一無所獲  她只是在耍滑頭
- And? - Nothing. She was just flexing.

414
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,820
凱茜
Cathy.

415
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,260
今天是誰安排了和克萊爾的會議
Who called a meeting with Claire today?

416
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,280
你還是戴維斯女士
You or Miss Davis?

417
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,500
是簡
Jane did.

418
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,250
非常感謝  凱茜
Thank you very much, Cathy.

419
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,330
-沒事了嗎  -是的  謝謝
- Was that all? - Yes, thank you.

420
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,170
抱歉  還有一件事
Oh, sorry, one more thing.

421
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,340
布雷格什么時候得到第四顆星的  哪屆政府
When did Braegher get his fourth star? Which administration?

422
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,680
幾屆前
A couple back.

423
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,130
他和布洛哈特是一起的嗎
So he and Brockhart together?

424
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,850
是的  還有幾位也在大概同一時期晉升
And a few others who were elevated around the same time, yes.

425
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,300
謝謝  凱茜
Thank you, Cathy.

426
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,800
我們談過的那個布洛哈特的料  你拿到了嗎
That Brockhart spot we talked about. You have it?

427
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,810
證實了嗎
Is it verified?

428
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,530
等等
Hold on.

429
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,330
好了
Ready.

430
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,510
我對天發誓
I swear to God,

431
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,470
要是安德伍德往邊境派兵
if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,

432
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,490
我第一個站出來讓軍人抗命
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.

433
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,050
如果美國總統下達那種命令
If the President of the United States gives orders like that,

434
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,820
你就讓他早死早超生
you put him out of his misery.

435
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,680
沒了  這是全部
That's it. That's all I have.

436
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,390
不  這很好
No, that's good.

437
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,210
如果我們撐過了今天
If we survive the day.

438
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,140
賽斯還和你在辦公室嗎
Is Seth still in the office with you?

439
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,750
我在總統辦公室  坐在堅決桌后
I'm in the Oval, sitting behind the Resolute desk.

440
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,110
你不會的
That's not you.

441
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,960
你總是對我下判斷
You know, you keep deciding who I am

442
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,920
卻總是誤判我
and you keep reading me wrong.

443
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,450
有關于這里發生了什么的謠言嗎
Are there rumors about what's going on down here?

444
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,060
有  但我們在應付了
Yes, but we're deflecting.

445
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,220
-康威競選團隊來問過嗎  -還沒有
- Has the Conway campaign reached out? - Not yet.

446
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,790
將軍在俄亥俄州做巡回宣傳  州長斷聯了
The general's on a stump in Ohio and the governor's off the grid.

447
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,270
-好的  繼續留意他  -我會的
- Okay. Stay on him. - I will.

448
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,950
除非是世界末日  那就沒關系了
Unless it's the end of the world and it doesn't matter.

449
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,900
再見  道格·斯坦普
Goodbye, Doug Stamper.

450
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,730
你確定你該進去那里嗎  金發姑娘
Are you sure you should be in there, Goldilocks?

451
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,070
你還好嗎
Are you all right?

452
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,860
坦白說  我在想我們在地下多深
Honestly, I was thinking about how far down we are

453
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,640
以及我不喜歡這樣
and how it's not my favorite thing.

454
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,000
對不起  你需要進來嗎
I... I'm sorry. Do... do you need to be in here?

455
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,560
不不  沒關系
No. No, no. It's fine.

456
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,930
我曾經害怕飛行  后來克服了
I used to have a fear of flying, but I got over it.

457
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,720
現在再也不怕了
Doesn't bother me at all anymore.

458
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,440
但我的恐懼似乎轉向了另一個方向
But the pendulum seems to have swung the other way.

459
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,710
如果我想太多  會開始有活埋感
If I think too hard, I start to feel buried.

460
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,580
不好意思  室內空氣循環讓我更加不安了
Forgive me. It's the recirculated air, makes things worse.

461
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,660
戴維斯女士  你為什么會來這兒
Miss Davis, why are you here?

462
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,400
-特勤局帶我來的  -不
- This is where the Secret Service led me. - No.

463
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,090
不管是否在準入名單上  你必定是自愿來的
Access list or not, you have to choose to be here.

464
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,960
我總是選擇最安全的地方
I always choose the safest place.

465
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,510
你為什么會來這兒
Why are you here?

466
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,110
感覺有機可尋
It felt like an opportunity.

467
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,550
會面的機會  私下會面
A chance for a meeting, not quite on the books.

468
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,510
我剛通完電話  總統女士
I just got off the phone, Madam President.

469
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,450
我有來自國外私人承包商的信息
I have information from abroad, from private contractors...

470
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,210
艾哈邁迪在大馬士革
Ahmadi is in Damascus.

471
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,220
多方勢力競相要捉住他
And a number of parties were racing to capture him,

472
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,880
其中當然包括美國
including, of course, the United States.

473
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,360
但是沒有人
But no one...

474
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,720
能在今天逮住他
will be capturing him today.

475
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,470
或是在選舉前逮住他
Or before the election.

476
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,050
我的職業
I've made a career...

477
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,750
就是處理世界的問題地區
out of dealing with problematic parts of the world.

478
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,760
我的工作  就是想象不可想象之事
It's kind of my vocation to imagine the unimaginable.

479
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,600
失陪了
Excuse me.

480
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,570
-抱歉  -抱歉
- Pardon me. - I'm sorry.

481
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,580
-沒事  -失陪了  總統先生
- It's all right. - Excuse me, Mr. President.

482
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,660
我感覺她想把艾哈邁迪獻給我們
I had the distinct feeling she was offering Ahmadi to us.

483
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,670
意思是
Meaning?

484
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,720
她說有多方勢力正在設法捉住他
She said there are a number of groups looking to capture him,

485
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,620
但在選舉之前都不會有人成功
but that no one will. Not today or before the election.

486
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,440
這是我們自找的
We brought this on ourselves.

487
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,430
-我們逼得太緊  -我們存活下來了
- We pushed too hard. - We've survived.

488
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,310
-我們自我孤立了  弗蘭西斯  -又如何
- We isolated ourselves, Francis. - So what?

489
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,960
你我都明白一件
We both know something

490
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,720
其他人拒絕承認的事
the rest of the world refuses to acknowledge.

491
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,710
世上沒有正義  唯有征服
There is no justice, only conquest.

492
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,390
我告訴你  我們要是準許他們疏散華盛頓
And let me tell you, we let them evacuate D.C.,

493
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,110
我們就沒戲了 克萊爾  我們就輸了 
we are done, Claire. We've lost.

494
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:03,750
請進
Yes?

495
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,250
我剛和莉安通了話  你們得聽聽
I just spoke to LeAnn. You need to hear this.

496
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,980
我對天發誓
I swear to God,

497
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,870
要是安德伍德往邊境派兵
if Underwood puts soldiers on those borders,

498
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,930
我第一個站出來讓軍人抗命
I'll be the first to tell them not to listen.

499
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,150
如果美國總統下達那種命令
If the President of the United States gives orders like that,

500
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,100
你就讓他早死早超生
you put him out of his misery.

501
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,520
讓我出去
Let me out.

502
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,970
-很抱歉  先生  我不能...  -開門
- I'm sorry, sir. I'm not allowed-- - Open the door.

503
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:34,380
-我奉命...  -我已經不是總統 
- My orders are to-- - I am no longer the president.

504
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,640
我已無義務或責任在身  是不是
I have no responsibilities or obligations. Isn't that correct?

505
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,490
解除威脅前我們不能讓你出去
We can't send you above until the threat is contained--

506
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,930
-把門打開  -讓他出去
- Open this door. - Let him out.

507
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,300
-女士  -讓總統出去
- Ma'am? - Let the president out.

508
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,690
把門打開
Open the door.

509
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,690
打開
Open it.

510
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,540
總統女士
Ma'am.

511
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,700
我們必須開始疏散
We need to initiate evacuation now.

512
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,220
不  將軍  我說疏散才疏散
No, General. We'll do it when I say so.

513
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,530
真的很抱歉
I'm really sorry.

514
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,900
我知道我答應你了  但我得去接我小孩
I know I agreed to do this, but I have to go pick up my kids.

515
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,570
沒事  要不我搭你的車
Okay. Well, what if I just rode in the car with you?

516
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,300
家長都在互相發信息
You know, parents are texting one another.

517
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,840
其中一位家長在國安局任職
One of them works at the NSA

518
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,330
他認為有恐襲的可能  所以...
and he thinks there's a terror threat, so...

519
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,620
這事以前也發生過  但...世事難料
I mean, this has happened before, but you just... You never know.

520
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,490
我母親上個月腎衰竭過世了
My mom died of kidney failure last month.

521
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,240
我很遺憾
Oh, I'm so sorry.

522
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,010
她在候捐名單上嗎
Uh, was she on the donor list?

523
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,080
有  但排得不夠靠前
Yeah, but not close enough to the top.

524
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,520
你介意嗎  我們可以邊走邊說
Do you mind? You could talk while we walk out of here.

525
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,450
好吧  好
Sure. Yeah.

526
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,210
安東尼病了多久了
Uh, how long was Anthony sick for?

527
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,160
大概兩年
About two years.

528
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,750
他一直在抗爭  非常頑強  直到最后
And he fought it hard. So hard. The entire way.

529
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:30,340
這地方  只要是現金支付  我就不多問
This unit, if they pay cash, I don't ask questions.

530
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,600
-但你記得那兩個年輕女子吧  -當然
- But you remember these young women? - Yeah, of course.

531
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,390
她們非常親密  如果你明白我的意思
They were very close, if you know what I mean.

532
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,820
但她們很可愛
But they were sweet.

533
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,070
那你有沒有見過這個人
And did you ever see... this man?

534
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,100
我不清楚究竟是怎么回事
Look, I don't know what was going on here.

535
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,700
但你認得他吧
But you recognize him?

536
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,580
認得
Yeah. Okay?

537
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,030
是有一個長這樣的人預付了三個月房租
Someone looking like him paid the rent. Three months, up-front.

538
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,390
但我說了  我不做評判
But like I said, I don't judge.

539
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,960
我不明白你問的是什么  總統先生
I'm not sure what you're asking, Mr. President.

540
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,010
得了吧
Oh, please.

541
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,510
某個人或者某些人
Someone or someones...

542
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,600
今天想把我和我夫人困在地下
tried to make my wife and I lose the election

543
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,240
好讓我們輸掉大選
by keeping us underground today.

544
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,600
我想知道你對此有什么了解
And I would like to know what you know about that.

545
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,350
我們都在實時應對
We've all been responding in real time

546
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,190
一起潛在的恐怖襲擊
to a potential terrorist attack.

547
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,910
但你選擇待在這里
But you chose to stay here.

548
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,950
你怎么不和我們一起去地堡
Why weren't you in the bunker with us?

549
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,010
我選擇留在我的辦公室
I chose to remain in my office

550
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,370
監督對艾哈邁德·艾哈邁迪的逮捕或擊殺
to oversee the capture or killing of one Ahmed Al Ahmadi.

551
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,730
但今天上午  你和布雷格將軍
And yet there was great tension this morning

552
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,750
鬧得很緊張
between you and General Braegher.

553
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:44,460
見解不同
Difference in approach.

554
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,110
我們不會疏散哥倫比亞特區的
We are not going to evacuate the District of Columbia.

555
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:51,640
我要你明白這一點  無論如何
I want you to understand that. Come what may.

556
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:57,790
另外我向你保證  凡妮莎
And I promise you this... Vanessa.

557
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,100
等我查明真相
When I find out exactly what has happened,

558
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,820
我會記得這次對話
I'm going to remember this conversation,

559
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,230
我會記得  你選擇了隱瞞信息
when you chose to withhold information.

560
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,730
布雷格將軍是布洛哈特將軍的強烈支持者
General Braegher is a strong supporter of General Brockhart.

561
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,170
他們串通了嗎
Did they conspire?

562
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,540
他們是不是想利用恐怖
Did they use... terror...

563
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,330
和此次疏散
and this evacuation

564
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,750
讓我輸掉這場大選
to cost me this election?

565
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,200
我并不喜歡將軍這個人
I'm not a fan of the general...

566
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:41,700
但這是個嚴重的指控
but... that's a strong charge,

567
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,370
而且沒有任何證據支撐
and there's no proof to support it.

568
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:48,630
你們這些人最擅長保護的  是彼此
You know, what you people protect best is each other.

569
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,130
艾哈邁迪不久前沒了蹤跡
We lost Ahmadi a short time ago

570
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,620
我們相信他已經不在大馬士革了
and believe he is no longer in Damascus.

571
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,250
當然了
Of course.

572
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,960
當然了
Of course.

573
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,190
你聽好了
Now you listen to me...

574
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,380
這就是一次
This was nothing more or less

575
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,030
明明白白的政變未遂  
than an attempted coup, plain and simple.

576
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,920
我不知道你直接參與的程度多深
And I do not know to what degree you have been directly involved.

577
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,040
但你必須化解它
But you will resolve it.

578
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,110
立即化解
Now.

579
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,680
聽明白了嗎
Do I make myself clear?

580
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,960
明白了  先生
Yes, sir.

581
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,480
卡車找到了
The truck's been found.

582
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,380
我們還不確定
Now we can't know for sure,

583
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,020
但似乎哈里發國沒有參與其中
but it looks as though ICO wasn't involved.

584
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,480
輻照器和銫都已找到
The irradiators and cesium were accounted for.

585
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,790
卡車偶然停在了
The truck was accidentally parked

586
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,140
達勒姆的一處醫療設備廠
at a medical device factory in Durham.

587
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,940
工頭沒有上報
The plant foreman never reported it.

588
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,180
所以我們暫時可以松口氣了
So we can relax for now, at least.

總統女士  我明天一早就遞交辭呈
Madam President. You'll have my resignation in the morning.

今天這是極端情況
these were extraordinary circumstances today.

593
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,630
如果我們絲毫不容忍人為疏忽
What would our administration be

594
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,060
那我們政府成什么了
if we didn't allow for some human failings?

595
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,020
準備發布會  我們馬上上去
Get the presser going. We're coming up now.

596

Concerning Ahmadi...

597

We didn't find him.

-你有什么提議  -我可以幫忙
- What are you offering? - Help.

600
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,850
如果您愿意  總統女士
If you'd like it, Madam President.

601

你能詳細說明一下今天早些時候的演習嗎
Can you elaborate on the drill earlier today?

602
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,640
演習時常進行
Well, drills happen all the time.

603
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,790
這是政府為了保證國家安全
It's part of the administration's ongoing efforts

604
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,840
做的不懈努力
to keep the country safe.

605
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,610
-是  但通常都會提前提醒  -那意義何在
- Yes, but there's usually a warning. - What's the point of that?

606
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,640
-下一位  -賽斯
- Who's next? - Seth.

607
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,930
你看檔案了嗎
Did you look at the file?

608
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,430
不用看
I didn't have to.

609
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,470
我希望一小時內
I'll expect your signature

610
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,840
收到你簽名的辭職信
on the resignation letter within the hour.

611
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,450
除非你選擇指出其他涉事的人
Unless you choose to implicate whoever else was involved.

612
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,790
你不配入主白宮
You don't deserve to be in the White House.

613
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,930
你和你丈夫都不配
Neither you nor your husband.

614
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:03,550
我本想祝你一切安好  但我覺得你不需要
I'd wish you the best, but I don't think you'll need it.

615
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,930
我相當確定你在私人機構也能干得很好
I'm fairly certain you'll do very well in the private sector.

616
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,250
我安排了周末跟簡·戴維斯的會面
I've scheduled a meeting with Jane Davis for the end of the week.

617
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,340
很好
Good.

618
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,330
還有  我之前就想說的
Also, I was going to mention this earlier,

619
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,900
凱茜對艾丹·麥卡倫非常好奇
but Cathy's been very curious about Aidan Macallan.

620
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,110
我已經轉移了她的視線  但...
I've thrown her off the scent, but...

621
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,090
凱茜不是問題  而是麥卡倫
Cathy's not the problem. The problem is Macallan,

622
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,260
還有那個縱容麥卡倫成為問題的人
and the person who allowed Macallan to become the problem.

623
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,420
基金募集到了超過了八萬
The foundation's raised over 80K.

624
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,720
安東尼于2016年3月15日進入1類捐贈名單
Anthony became status one on the donor list on March 15th, 2016.

625
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,630
莫雷蒂說那是她生命的最后一天
Moretti talked about it as, uh, the last day of her life

626
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,820
之后又改了口
before she corrected herself.

627
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,530
還有  時時刻刻陪著孩子
What else, spent every spare second with the kids.

628
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,660
他們還組裝卡丁車來著
They were building a go-kart.

629
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,660
本來就要完成了
They were pretty close to done.

630
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,840
-好吧  -還有呢
- Okay. - I got more.

631
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,400
-不用  我知道了  -你本想知道什么
- No, I got it. - What were you looking for?

632
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
沒什么
It's nothing.

633
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,320
-好吧  -怎么了
- Okay. - What?

634
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,950
你打算告訴我今天白宮發生了什么嗎
You wanna tell me what happened in the White House today?

635
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,430
不打算
No, I don't.

636
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,870
好吧  我一直等著跟你說點事
All right, I've been waiting to say something,

637
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,290
可我等得不想再等了
but I've waited and I don't want to wait anymore.

638
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,140
幫我留意下白宮的工作吧  在新聞部
Consider me for a job at the White House, in comms.

639
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,590
"去拿這個  幫我找那個  我要這個"  
"Go get this. Find me that. I need this."

640
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:31,580
我受夠了
I'm tired of it.

641
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,780
你不提出  就會被人命令
If you don't ask, you get asked.

642
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,300
我開始意識到這點了
That's what I'm starting to realize.

643
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,620
我會幫你推薦的
I'll put a word in.

644
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,170
是嗎  這話什么意思
Yeah? Well, what does that mean?

645
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,920
意思是時機合適的話  我會提及你
It means that when the moment is right, I'll mention you.

646
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,490
沒錯  最終宣布后
Yes, whenever it happens...

647
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,240
這次任命便能打破最高法院的僵局
this appointment would break the court's deadlock

648
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,640
我們終于能繼續推進這次大選了
and we would get this election going again.

649
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,310
但請大家退一步想一想
But let's step back a minute...

650
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,440
-田納西州...  -你的鹽呢
- Tennessee... - Where's your salt?

651
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,430
-無論誰贏下田州  -水池右邊
- Whoever wins that state... - Right side of the sink.

652
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,290
這樣就取決于最后一個州
It's come down to one state:

653
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,600
俄亥俄州
Ohio.

654
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,350
一個州的選擇  將左右
One state is about to choose

655
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,060
下一任美國總統的人選
the next President of these United States.

656
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,450
那真是演習嗎
Was it really a drill?

657
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,410
這屆政府一貫喜歡搞閉門政治
This is an administration that operates behind closed doors.

658
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,560
知道嗎  今天發生了那么多事
You know, with everything that was happening today,

659
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,070
《先驅報》還來了一個記者
this reporter from the Herald came by.

660
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:23,990
什么
What?

661
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,870
他想寫東尼和基金的報道
Wants to do a story on Tony and the foundation.

662

他叫什么
What was his name?

663
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,740
戴維斯暗示她能幫我們找到艾哈邁迪
Davis implied she could help us track down Ahmadi.

664
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,150
我覺得我們該聽聽她要說什么
I think we should hear what she has to say.

665
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,530
她有一種氣質  對吧
She's got a quality about her, doesn't she?

666
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,760
令人著迷又害怕
Attractive and terrifying.

667
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,650
就像想撫摸紅尾狐的沖動
Like the urge to pet a red tail fox.

668
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,830
將軍遞交辭呈了嗎
The general offered his letter?

669
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,300
是的  但拒絕供出其他人
Uh, he did. And refused to implicate anyone.

670
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,930
你說得對  克萊爾  我們得和厄舍談談
You were right, Claire. We need to sit down with Usher.

- Well, you need to be invited to that. - Yes, let's get him in.

675
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,820
我知道這很顯然  但那總讓我受觸動
I know it's obvious, but it always strikes me.

676

No women.

那個時代不一樣
Well, it was a different time.

678

真可怕
Terrible.

679
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,010
戰爭還是時代的局限性
The war or the restrictions of the era?

680
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,420
都是
Both.

681
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,130
你知道我的態度
Well, you know my position.

白宮作戰室位于白宮西廂的地下室
而用于藏身的總統緊急行動中心(PEOC)則位于東廂的生活區下面
2011年奧巴馬在任時期  橢圓辦公室后院曾大興土木
