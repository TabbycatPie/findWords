老爸老妈浪漫史
第七季  第二集

10
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,120
天啊  我宿醉还没过去
Oh, God, guys, I'm still really hungover.

11
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,690
我真的毁了一场婚礼吗
Did I really ruin a wedding?

12
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,790
没有  你没毁了婚礼
No, you didn't ruin a wedding.

13
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,190
只有接待处而已
Just the reception.

14
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,160
还有隔壁的犹太成年礼
And the bar mitzvah next door.

15
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,000
还有我的裙子
And my dress.

16
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,530
还有你的裙子  你一度穿了条裙子
And your dress. You put on a dress at one point.

17
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,470
好了  到此为止
Okay, you know what, that's it.

18
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,070
我就要当爸爸了  我要成为
I'm about to be a dad, and I want to be

19
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,670
让我孩子崇拜的男人
the kind of man that my child can look up to.

20
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,310
所以在此郑重宣布
So, sweeping declaration--

21
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,650
我此生再也不喝醉了
I am never getting drunk again as long as I live.

22
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,850
我说真的
I'm serious.

23
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,050
<i>孩子们  你们的马修叔叔</i>
<i>Kids, it's not that</i> <i>your Uncle Marshall</i>

24
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,550
<i>并不嗜酒</i>
<i>had a drinking problem.</i>

25
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,450
<i>只是他每次像那样郑重宣布</i>
<i>But whenever he made a sweeping</i> <i>declaration like that,</i>

26
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,960
<i>结果你们也都清楚</i>
<i>you pretty much knew...</i>

27
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,060
第二天

28
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,430
我又醉了
I did it again.

29
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>这件事回头再细说</i>
<i>But I'm getting ahead</i> <i>of myself.</i>

30
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,260
你的腿怎么了
What happened to your leg?

31
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,200
没事
Oh, nothing.

32
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,970
我约了诺拉喝咖啡
I'm meeting Nora for coffee.

33
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,600
她还在生我的气  所以我需要装可怜
She's still mad at me, so I need some sympathy points.

34
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,850
她喜欢音乐剧  所以我准备告诉她
She likes musicals, so I'm going to tell her

35
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:55,610
我在表演《堂吉诃德》的时候
I fell off the stage

36
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,610
不慎从舞台上摔下来了
during a performance of <i>Man of La Mancha.</i>

37
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,610
你们觉得呢
What do you think?

38
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,340
别提演员的事
Lose the cast.

39
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,950
单人剧目啊  我喜欢
A one-man show-- I like it!

40
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,950
《堂吉诃德》是群舞剧目

41
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,980
我们先理理思路
Just so we're clear--

42
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,820
这个女人生你气是因为你对她撒谎
this woman is mad at you because you lied to her.

43
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,150
而你的解决方法  是假装摔坏腿博同情吗
So your solution is to pretend you broke your leg?

44
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,660
你说的对
You're right.

45
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,060
应该加个护颈  多谢  莉莉
A neck brace. Thanks, Lil.

46
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,090
天  我早点问你们就好了
Man, I wish I'd have talked to you sooner.

47
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,060
我这一整天都在练习使用这副拐杖
I've been practicing with these crutches all day

48
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,370
把它们落在我楼道的人
and whoever left them in my lobby

49
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,070
现在应该非常需要它们吧
probably really needs 'em.

50
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,270
我有好消息
Well, uh, I have some good news.

51
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,670
你们都知道  我最近决定重振旗鼓
As you all know, I recently decided to get back out there

52
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,210
开始约会了  然后
and start dating again. And, uh, well...

53
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,910
这是你吗
Is this you?

54
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,920
是啊  你好
Uh, yeah. Hi.

55
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,250
我是泰德
I'm Ted.

56
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,420
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - Hi.

57
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,550
这太好了  泰德
That's great, Ted.

58
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,490
是啊是啊  这纯粹是机缘巧合
Yeah. Yeah, it was a moment of pure destiny.

59
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,830
绝对不是我故意去创造的
The kind you just can't manufacture.

60
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,930
或许只是我的个人看法
Or so I thought.

61
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,000
哇  我居然成了封面人物
Oh, no. How did I get on there?

62
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,700
你好  我是泰德・莫斯比
Hi. Ted Mosby.

63
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,000
有罪啊
Guilty.

64
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,540
嗨  泰德・莫斯比
Hi. Ted Mosby.

65
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,010
真是太难为情了
That is embarrassing.

66
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,880
我应该当《尴尬一刻》的封面人物
I should be on the cover of <i>Egg On My Face</i> magazine.

67
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,080
可我没有
But I'm not.

68
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,220
我是被印在了这本
I'm on the cover of this one.

69
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,480
嗨  泰德・莫斯比
Hi. Ted Mosby.

70
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,970
一天内  16次机缘巧合
16 moments of pure destiny in one day,

71
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,360
在这16人中  有10人是单身
and of those 16,ten were single.

72
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,690
这10人中  有7人对我有好感
Of those ten, seven liked what they saw.

73
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,660
在这7人中  有4人是女性
Of those seven,four were women.

74
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,070
在这4人中  有2人给我了真实号码
Of those four,two gave me their real number.

75
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,800
然后我成功约到了她们俩
And I have a date with both of them.

76
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,210
太好了
Okay.

77
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,180
各位  是加里森・库兹打来的
Guys,it's Garrison Cootes.

78
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,850
<i>孩子们  加里森・库兹是</i>
<i>Kids, Garrison Cootes</i> <i>was a senior partner</i>

79
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,780
<i>哈尼维尔/库兹公司的高级合伙人</i>
<i>at Honeywell & Cootes.</i>

80
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,780
<i>此公司是美国最大的保护环境律所</i>
<i>One of the biggest</i> <i>environmental law firms</i> <i>in America.</i>

81
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,850
<i>马修为了供职与此  愿意不惜一切</i>
<i>Marshall would have given</i> <i>anything to work there.</i>

82
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,860
如果我得不到这份工作  我也许沦为
If I don't get this job, I might end up working

83
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,490
玉米卷快餐店的小工
at, like, a Taco Bell somewhere.

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,720
谁也不想这样
And nobody wants that.

85
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,910
不过也许正合你们心意
Or maybe you guys want that,

86
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,630
因为那样你们就有免费玉米卷吃了
because you'll get free tacos,

87
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,800
毕竟你们是我的好朋友
'cause your my peeps.

88
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,530
但是现在我需要你们所有人冷静下来
But right now I need all of you to calm down!

89
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,100
您好
Hello.

90
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,700
马修  我是加里森・库兹
Marshall, this is Garrison Cootes.

91
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,470
抱歉我没能及时回复你
Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner,

92
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,670
我最近老抽不开身
but I've just been swamped.

93
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,510
这太好笑了  因为我现在真的
Which is funny, 'cause I'm literally

94
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,350
身处一片沼泽里  抽不开身
standing in a swamp.

95
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,450
总之  我来这儿采集一些
Anyway, I'm just out here, I'm just collecting some samples

96
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,650
我们调查的污染案要用的取样
for this pollution case we're working on.

97
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,990
我喜欢你们的工作
I love the work you guys do.

98
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,860
有条鳄鱼[双关语有假话的意思]
That's a croc...

99
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,100
不  我说真的
No, I mean it.

100
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,030
不不  真有条鳄鱼  离我五步远
No, no, there's a crocodile about five feet away from me.

101
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,500
所以我准备忽略我们对话期间
So I'm just going to ignore the hot urine

102
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,930
有泡热腾腾的尿灌满了我的靴子
filling my waders as we speak,

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
我只想告诉你  我们对你很感兴趣
and tell you that we're very interested.

104
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,300
他很感兴趣
He's interested.

105
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,170
显然我们还要做一些信誉度
Obviously we have to do some sort of credit check,

106
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,010
犯罪记录和网络搜索等调查
you know, a criminal record and Google search,

107
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,240
只要不出现什么不堪入目的事情
but as long as nothing unseemly turns up,

108
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,310
你就准备入职吧  伙计
you're good to go, man.

109
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,340
这太好了  库兹先生
That is fantastic, Mr. Cootes!

110
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,010
我先挂了
Well, I gotta run.

111
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,680
真是太好笑了
This is so funny,

112
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,690
因为如果我再不跑就真的要挂了
because, actually, I physically have to run now.

113
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,920
-鳄鱼看见你了  -是啊  它在向我逼近
- Croc saw you? - He's advancing, yeah.

114
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,870
第二天晚上  巴尼约了诺拉喝咖啡
The next night, Barney met Nora for coffee.

115
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,210
谢天谢地  他放弃了拄拐博同情的戏码
Thankfully, without the ridiculous leg cast.

116
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:19,040
诺拉  谢谢你来见我
Hey, Nora, thanks for meeting me here.

117
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,140
你脖子怎么了
What happened to your neck?

118
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,750
我  哦  没事
My wha...? Oh, it's nothing.

119
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,880
我当时正在表演单人剧目《屋顶上的小提琴手》
I was performing in a one-man show of Fiddler.

120
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,890
然后不幸从屋顶摔下来了
There was this roof.

121
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,220
哇  那人有一对绝世好咪
Wow, that one has fantastic ta-tas.

122
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,020
什么  哪里
What, where?

123
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,590
完蛋  暴露了
Oh... Oh, damn it.

124
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,290
再见
Ta-ta.

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,430
等等  诺拉  等等  别走
Wait, Nora, wait... No, look, please don't.

126
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,430
抱歉  真的很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

127
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,960
你这是怎么回事
What is the matter with you?

128
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,060
什么样的人才需要撒这种谎
What kind of person needs to lie like that.

129
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,670
一个真心喜欢你的人
A person who really, really likes you.

130
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,900
或许更确切地说  是一个怀疑
And suspects, probably accurately,

131
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,400
自己配不上你的人
that you're way out of his league,

132
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,410
所以他觉得有必要
and so he feels the need to...

133
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,610
抱歉  你刚才说的绝世好咪  是开玩笑的吧
I'm sorry, you were kidding about the fantastic ta-tas, right?

134
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,680
因为我扫完一遍  都没看见
'Cause I'm looking around and I do not see 'em...

135
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,120
我刚才连续赴了两个约会
I just had two back-to-back dates.

136
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,020
没错  和两位可爱的女人
That's right, two lovely ladies,

137
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,920
喝了四大杯卡布奇诺  还有
four large cappuccinos, and...

138
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,390
马上回来
one sec.

139
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,490
两分钟后

140
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,190
我不确定哪个更好
And I don't know which date was more awesome.

141
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,360
我来介绍一下她们吧
Let's meet the girls.

142
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,330
杰西卡是个领罗氏奖学金的研究生
Jessica is a Rhodes scholar.

143
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,330
罗氏奖学金是英国大学历史最长并且也是声誉最高的奖学金

144
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,870
她周游了世界列国
She's traveled all over the world.

145
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,570
会说四种语言  还是个职业钢琴演奏家
Speaks four languages, is a concert pianist.

146
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,310
而克莱尔则主动买单
And Claire reached for the check.

147
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,610
所以我也不知道
So I don't know.

148
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,080
差距好微弱哦
It's a squeaker.

149
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,640
这两个女孩
I mean, both of these girls

150
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,050
都是潜力股
have the potential to be something really special.

151
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,120
-她俩同时晋级了  -等等
- They both move on to the next round. - Wait a minute.

152
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,790
你是准备脚踏两条船吗
You're going to date two girls at once?

153
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,820
难道你不觉得应该在正式恋爱之前
Don't you think you should just choose one

154
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,950
先选好一个吗
before it gets serious?

155
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,090
什么算正式恋爱
Define serious.

156
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,020
一言难尽
Well, that's complicated.

157
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,230
你得先权衡期望值
I guess you have to weigh expectations,

158
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,460
感情投资
emotional investments...

159
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,660
三垒
Third base.

160
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,160
上了三垒就算
Seriously, third base.

161
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,930
所以我和这两个女孩能上到二垒  对吧
So I can go to second base with both of these girls, no problem?

162
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,330
放手做吧  朋友  放手去做
Oh, honk away, my friend. Yeah, honk away.

163
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,340
不是吧
Oh, no.

164
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,410
自从库兹先生提出要调查背景后
Ever since Mr. Cootes mentioned the background check,

165
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,540
马修就一直在刷网页
Marshall had been scouring the Internet.

166
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,380
他发现大部分都无伤大雅的小玩笑
Most of what he found was pretty harmless.

167
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,850
有的还特别赞  直到...
In some cases, really awesome, until...

168
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,910
不妙
Not good.

169
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,550
这下不妙了
This-- this is not good.

170
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,950
谢了  史黛西
Thanks, Stacy.

171
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,320
卫斯利大学开了家新的自助餐厅
Wesleyan has a new cafeteria,

172
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,120
感谢捐助这笔丰厚善款的
thanks to the generous endowment from--

173
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,900
刚才是说有人慷慨解囊吗
Did somebody say generous endowment?

174
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,600
我是马修・埃里克森  也可以叫我啤酒猛男里斯
I'm Marshall Eriksen, but you can call me Beercules!

175
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,380
随便嫁祸给一个路人就好啦
Well, that could be anybody.

176
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,610
伙计  我居然忘了啤酒猛男里斯的事
Oh, man, I forgot about Beercules.

177
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,610
话说这个网站是谁做的
Who made this Web site anyway?

178
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,730
-皮特・钥仙  -难怪
- Pete Durkenson.- Of course.

179
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,820
是那个人说服你裸奔校园的吗
Is that the guy who convinced you to run across campus naked?

180
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,660
我当时正申请加入他的兄弟会
I was pledging his frat,

181
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,690
不过三天后我就放弃了
which I gave up on after three days,

182
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,260
因为兄弟会里鱼龙混杂
because frats are stupid and elitist

183
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,100
而且我发现他不是兄弟会的成员
and also I found out he wasn't in a frat.

184
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,030
天啊  太棒了
Oh, my God.This is awesome.

185
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,940
我刚接到建筑师舞会的邀请
I just got invited to the Architects' Ball,

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,240
这是为全市最棒的建筑师举行的年会
the annual gala that honors the city's greatest architects.

187
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,440
天  你们知道这事的弊端了吧
Oh, no, you guys see why this sucks, right?

188
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,110
因为这年会是
Because it's an annual gala

189
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,610
为全市最棒的建筑师举行的吗
honoring the city's greatest architects?

190
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,380
罗宾  这是年度社交活动
Robin, this is the social event of the year.

191
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,350
如果你带女伴去参加了这次盛会
You take a girl to the Architects' Ball,

192
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,090
兄弟  你今晚绝对能上三垒
brother, you're going to third base.

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,030
不管我选谁做我的女伴
Whichever girl I take as my date,

194
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,760
她都会在今晚前
she will be Miss Ted Mosby's girlfriend

195
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,560
成为泰德・莫斯比的女友
by the end of the night.

196
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,370
好  不能再举棋不定了
Okay, no more sitting on the fence.

197
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,500
罗宾  把我的拍纸簿拿来
Robin, get me my legal pad.

198
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,840
二选一时间
It's pros and cons time!

199
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,340
孩子们  这是发自内心的欢呼
And kids, they really cheered.

200
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,410
有件事我要说清楚
Let me make one thing very clear to you.

201
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,780
我不和撒谎骗我的人约会
I don't date guys who lie to me.

202
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,020
你看  我事先不知道
Well, see, I did not know that.

203
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,320
我的错
My bad.

204
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,050
从现在起  我不会撒谎了
So, from here on in, no more lies.

205
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,920
我不会再骗你了
I will never lie to you again.

206
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,660
我是认真的  不信你试试
I'm serious. Ask me anything.

207
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,560
好
Okay.

208
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,760
你有没有成功
Have you ever successfully

209
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,900
骗到女人上床
gotten a woman in bed by lying to her?

210
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,270
我有没有
Have I ever...

211
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,570
如果我完全坦诚
If I'm being totally honest...

212
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,810
有
Yes.

213
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,640
不止一次
More than once?

214
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,980
不止一次
More than once...

215
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,550
这真是
Wow, that's...

216
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,950
我想如果我们斤斤计较
I guess if we're splitting hairs,

217
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,020
然后就会涉及到我说了多少次谎
Then, technically... there was a plurality

218
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,200
来骗一个女人上床
to the times I've lied to women for sex having purposes.

219
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,400
多少次
What were they?

220
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,100
大部分是九次或者十次
Nines and tens mostly.

221
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,800
只有一回是四次
There was a four once.

222
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,000
她是个丑八怪
She was a slump buster.

223
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,840
但是之后  我连续得手的次数肯定会让你大吃一惊
But, Nora, after that, I had a run that you would not believe.

224
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,410
天啊  诚实的感觉真好
Man, honesty feels good.

225
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,210
你撒的都是什么谎
What were the lies?

226
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,710
你想知道  我为了哄女人上床
You want me to tell you every lie I've ever told a woman

227
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,080
而撒的每一个谎吗
to get her into bed?

228
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,920
只要骗到她们跟你发生关系的谎  我都要听
A bed or any other place you had sex with her.

229
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,720
你果然够醒目
Oh, you're good.

230
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,050
皮特  皮特  你好
Pete, Pete. Hey.

231
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,720
啤酒猛男里斯
Beercules!

232
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,260
来抱一个  老兄
Bring it in, dude.

233
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,090
我一直在给你打电话
Hey, I've been trying to call you,

234
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,060
打了一整晚了
like, all night.

235
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,430
我的天  对不起
Oh, my God, sorry.

236
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,330
我本来可以接的  但是今天是周二之夜
I would have answered, but it is Tuesday night.

237
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,260
今天是周日
It's Sunday.

238
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,030
你知道那意味着什么
And you know what that means.

239
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,370
"爱德华啤酒手"
"Edward Forty Hands."

240
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,340
孩子们  这是个游戏
Kids, "Edward Forty Hands"

241
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,640
把两瓶四十盎司的麦芽酒
is a game that involves taping two 40-ounce bottles

242
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,140
绑在你的双手上
of malt liquor to your hands.

243
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,980
任务就是喝完两瓶酒
The object is to finish both bottle--

244
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,510
天啊  我什么要告诉你们这些
Oh, my God, why am I telling you this?

245
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,910
我们继续主题
Let's move on.

246
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,150
你知道我裸奔的那个视频吧
Okay, you know that old video of me streaking?

247
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,450
我每天都温习
I watch it every day.

248
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,790
麻烦你把视频从网上删了吧
Well, I need you to take it down off the Internet.

249
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,890
比如  就现在
Like, right now.

250
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,530
现在你有两个选择
There are two ways that can happen.

251
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,630
要么你给我四百万
One, you can give me $4 million,

252
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,800
要么你在我上厕所的时候搭把手
or... you can help me go to the bathroom,

253
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,400
因为  我不能
because I... I can't...

254
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,240
不  这两个选择都没得商量
Yeah, those are two non-negotiable no's.

255
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,940
很遗憾我们没能达成交易
Well, I'm sorry we could not do business together.

256
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,010
如果你不介意
But if you'll excuse me,

257
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,570
我正在玩"爱德华啤酒手"
I'm in the middle of a game of "Edward Forty Hands,"

258
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,740
比赛很激烈
and the competition is fierce.

259
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,410
你和谁玩呢
Who are you playing with, anyway?

260
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,920
自娱自乐
Just myself.

261
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,290
与此同时  巴尼继续把他骗女孩上床的
Meanwhile, Barney continued listing every lie

262
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,620
伎俩全数抖出
he'd ever told to get laid.

263
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,890
没时间解释我为什么被咬了
There's no time to explain how I got bit there.

264
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,860
我需要有人帮我把毒吸出来
I just need someone to suck the poison out.

265
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,090
外科医生给我换了一张新面孔
The surgeons gave me a new face,

266
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,060
亲爱的
honey.

267
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,760
我还活着  你不开心吗
Aren't you relieved I'm alive?

268
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,670
我是大卫・贝克汉姆
Me llamo David Beckham.

269
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,230
如果我来选《白天鹅》的演员
If I were only casting The White Swan

270
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,770
女主角绝对是你
the role would be yours.

271
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,910
不  我是个拉拉
No, I am a lesbian.

272
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,340
只不过我身上戴的某个器官实在是太栩栩如生了
This thing that I'm wearing is just really lifelike.

273
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,440
行了  这些都跳过
Okay, let's skip ahead.

274
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,510
最坏的是哪一次
What's the worst one?

275
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,350
毫无下限
The lowest of the low?

276
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,910
怪异之极的那次
The creme de la creepy?

277
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,420
有一次我利用电影《灵魂歌手》来泡妞
Uh... Oh, I once pulled The Soul Man.

278
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,520
因为有个美女  她只跟黑人约会
There was this beautiful girl who only dated black guys...

279
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,890
巴奈尔  我就知道
Barnell! Ooh, I knew it!

280
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,330
我无法抉择
I can't decide.

281
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,000
她们都很棒
They're both awesome.

282
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,570
要是建筑师有两个舞会就好了  对吧
If only architects had two balls, right, Ted?

283
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,570
引申义  要是您这大建筑师有勇气抉择就好了

284
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,830
我有办法
I got this.

285
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900
泰德  左还是右
Ted, left or right?

286
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,770
对对  好主意
Yes, yes, great idea.

287
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,510
交给命运来抉择吧
Let the fates decide, huh?

288
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,740
我选左边
I will pick left.

289
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,340
随便打给其中一个
Just call one of 'em.

290
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,750
泰德  在你的内心深处
Ted, deep in your heart,

291
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,780
你知道你更喜欢的是谁
you know that you kind of like one more than the other.

292
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,420
相信我  带另一个去
Trust me-- take the other.

293
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,290
我可能没说清楚  这是
Um, maybe I haven't been clear: this is...

294
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,950
建筑师舞会  罗宾
the Architects' Ball, Robin.

295
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,360
众星云集啊
It's a star-studded event.

296
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,430
哪个名人会去啊
Okay, name one celebrity who's gonna be there.

297
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,330
蓝尼・克罗维兹
Uh... Lenny Kravitz.

298
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,490
蓝尼・克罗维兹会去
Lenny Kravitz is gonna be there?

299
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,830
是啊  他每年都来
Yeah. He's there every year.

300
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,160
那家伙可是个摇滚明星呢
And that guy's a rock star.

301
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,330
泰德  我一直在想
You know, Ted, I've been thinking--

302
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,440
现在让你在这两个女孩中做决定  有点为时过早
it's too soon to narrow it down between these two girls.

303
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,740
带一个朋友去吧
Just take a friend.

304
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,540
我不知道  或许你可以带
Like I... I don't know, maybe, uh, a friend

305
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,710
家里有蓝尼・克罗维兹海报的那个吧
who had a poster of Lenny Kravitz on her wall,

306
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,380
也许她的整个高中时期
and may or may not have, perhaps,

307
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,820
和那海报分分合合  把它黏上撕下了无数次
dated that poster, on and off, throughout high school.

308
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,620
这个利弊列表没什么用处
This pros and cons list isn't cutting it.

309
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,660
我要一个彩色图表
I need a color chart.

310
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,030
彩色图表  彩色图表
Color chart! Color chart!

311
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:55,300
孩子们  这是发自内心的欢唱
And, kids, we all really chanted.

312
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,830
皮特  求你了
Pete, please.

313
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,560
我待业家中
I'm unemployed.

314
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,000
还有巨额贷款
I have a huge mortgage.

315
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,670
我的孩子马上就要降临人世
I have a baby on the way.

316
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,170
而现在  我却要因为十五年前的一个玩笑
And now, I'm about to lose a job I really need

317
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,140
失去一份我急需的工作
because of a 15-year-old prank!

318
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,710
你听到你自己说的话了么
Ugh! Do you hear yourself?

319
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,080
啤酒猛男里斯  你怎么了
Beercules, what happened?

320
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,080
你完全不一样了
You're like a different person.

321
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:13,210
视频里那人好棒
The guy in that video was awesome.

322
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,820
他潜力无限
He had potential.

323
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,090
他还可能当上兄弟会的老大哦
He could have been president of the frat one day.

324
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,620
根本就没什么兄弟会
There was no frat!

325
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,890
现在他就一扫兴鬼
Now he's just a bummer.

326
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,960
我并不想做扫兴鬼
It's not like I want to be a bummer.

327
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,530
我只是  不得已而为之
I just... I have to be.

328
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,960
我要做父亲了
I'm gonna be a dad.

329
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,260
你以后也会有孩子的
You'll have kids someday.

330
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,360
那时你就会明白我的心情
You'll understand.

331
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,070
兄弟  哥有四孩子
Dude, I have four kids.

332
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,900
皮特  请你把视频删掉吧
Pete, please take the video down.

333
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,270
好的  啤酒猛男里斯 我会把视频删掉
All right, Beercules, I'll take the video down.

334
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,840
如果
If...

335
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,710
你能在我指定的比赛中胜过我
you can best me in a game of my own choosing.

336
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,840
不是吧
Oh, no...

337
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,380
我选择精彩之战
And I select the beautiful game,

338
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,650
动人之技
the sweet science...

339
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,420
皮特  拜托  我还宿醉未醒呢
Pete, please, I'm so hungover...

340
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,620
王者之拼
...the sport of kings...

341
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,420
我不想玩"爱德华啤酒手"
I don't want to play "Edward Forty Hands."

342
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,850
我本来想说飞镖
I was gonna say darts--

343
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,620
那就比"爱德华啤酒手"吧
but "Edward Forty Hands" it is!

344
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,360
以上是太空相关谎言
And that concludes all the space-related lies.

345
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,030
再来说运动方面的
Let's move on to the world of sports.

346
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,960
等等  我刚想起还有一个太空的
Oh, wait, sorry-- I just thought of another space one.

347
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,330
我被月球上的蛇咬了
"I've been bitten by a moon snake.

348
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,700
你得吸光我的太空之毒
You need to suck all the space poison out of my--"

349
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,600
好了  巴尼
Okay, Barney, uh,

350
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,070
我明天八点得上班
I have to be at work tomorrow at 8:00,

351
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,640
如果我现在就走
which means I have just about enough time

352
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,610
整好够时间泡11个小时的澡  安慰自己受伤的心灵
to sit in a shower for 11 hours, hugging myself.

353
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,450
咱们聊得挺开心的
So this was fun.

354
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,680
我再打给你还是...
Can I call you, or...?

355
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,820
巴尼  你风趣  帅气
Barney, you're funny, handsome

356
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,550
非常聪明
and really quite clever.

357
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,160
但同时你也是个毫无良知的人
But you're also a sociopath.

358
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,620
三个优点比一个缺点  那
Well, I count three pros and one con, so...

359
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,230
为什么你会觉得和我还有机会呢
How do you still think you have a chance with me?

360
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,600
因为你听我说了一晚
Because you sat here all night.

361
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,070
你可以马上走的  但你没有
You could've left right away, but you didn't.

362
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,140
诺拉  那些谎言  都是过去的我
Look, Nora, all those lies-- that's the old me.

363
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,840
我向你发誓  我在试图改变
But I swear to you, I am trying to change.

364
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,640
是你  让我想改变
You... make me want to change.

365
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,580
我如何知道这不是个谎言
How do I know that's not a lie?

366
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,280
我会向你证明
I'll prove it.

367
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,180
我会向你证明我有多认真
I will prove how serious I am.

368
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,950
我不会离开这家餐厅
I will not leave this diner

369
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,820
除非你答应再跟我约会
until I get a second date with you.

370
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,360
再见  巴尼
Good-bye, Barney.

371
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,260
我没开玩笑哦
I'm not kidding.

372
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,860
这家餐厅24小时营业
This is a 24-hour diner.

373
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,060
我会永远待在这里  如果必须的话  我会的
I'll stay here forever, if I have to-- and I will!

374
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,030
来杯水就行  谢谢
Just water for me. Thanks.

375
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,410
好了  红色代表吸引力
Okay, so red indicates level of attractiveness,

376
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,710
蓝色  智力激发
blue-- intellectual stimulation,

377
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,410
绿色  情感沟通
green-- emotional connection,

378
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,110
黄色  人生目标的和谐性
yellow-- compatibility of life goals,

379
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,650
紫色  有没有抢着买单
and purple-- whether or not she reached for the check.

380
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,020
看来杰西卡领先了
Well, it looks like Jessica's ahead

381
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,190
前四项
in the first four categories.

382
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,860
有没有抢着买单
Did not reach for the check...

383
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,260
这件礼服吗
Oh, this?

384
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,070
没什么大不了的
No big deal. This...

385
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,800
虽然价值三个月房租
This cost three months rent,

386
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,170
可惜没机会穿
and, uh, I've never gotten to wear it,

387
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,370
我之所以会买  是因为你邀请我参加一个隆重的场合
because I bought it for that big event that you invited me to,

388
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,970
可惜最终泡汤了
which then fell through.

389
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,410
可你知道吗
But, you know what?

390
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,940
你不用感到内疚哦
Don't feel guilty about that.

391
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,980
什么场合
What big event?

392
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,110
为你叔叔举办的
That thing with your uncle.

393
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,110
他的葬礼吗
His funeral?

394
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,550
那可不是泡汤
It didn't fall through,

395
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,950
是他奇迹般地苏醒了好不好
he miraculously came out of a coma.

396
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,220
我原谅你了
And I forgive you.

397
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,320
现在  我能够有机会见蓝尼・克罗维兹吗
Now, can I please meet Lenny Kravitz?

398
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,160
我又喝醉了
I did it again!

399
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,060
亲爱的
Aw, honey.

400
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:16,700
你又喝醉了
You got drunk again.

401
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,230
真不敢相信我居然下注他不再犯
I can't believe I took the over.

402
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,570
申明下  就我当前醉酒的情况而言
Just to be clear, "I did it again" is not a reference...

403
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,010
"我又喝醉了"这句话没那么简单
to my current state of inebriation.

404
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,170
那是有多复杂
What's it a reference to?

405
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,340
我叫马修・埃里克森
My name is Marshall Eriksen.

406
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,350
现年33岁
I'm 33 years old.

407
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,220
如果我的未来老板  加里森・库兹
And if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes,

408
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,650
在看这个
is watching this...

409
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,690
向啤酒猛男里斯鞠躬吧
bow down to Beercules!

410
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,730
随便嫁祸给一个路人就好啦
Well, that could be anybody.

411
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,540
天啊
Oh, goodness.

412
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,970
皮特  我是莉莉・艾得仁
Pete, this is Lily Aldrin.

413
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,470
我就开门见山了
I'm gonna make this real simple:

414
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,450
你要删掉马修的视频
You're gonna take down that video of Marshall.

415
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,220
知道为什么吗
You know why?

416
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,280
你在大学时约会的三个女生  都是我的朋友
Because I'm friends with three girls who dated you in college,

417
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,750
女生之间是无话不谈的
and girls tell each other everything.

418
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,220
连任何一个"小"细节都不放过
Every tiny detail.

419
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,720
所以
Huh. So...

420
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,660
滴答滴答  皮特  小老二的钟要敲响咯
tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes the little wee-wee clock.

421
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,990
皮特的老二很小吗
Pete's got a little wee-wee?

422
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,830
不知道  大家都点了什么
No idea. What's everyone getting?

423
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,960
这事注定是要发生的
This was bound to happen eventually.

424
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,770
我一直拼命压制
I've been trying so hard to suppress, like,

425
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,630
自己快活无知的一面
my carefree idiot side,

426
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,240
可越压制越爆发
that it just rebelled and came out swingin'!

427
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,570
的确如此
It sure did.

428
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,910
快看我  我是人体风车
Look at me! I'm a windmill!

429
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,110
我骗谁呀  我果然不够格当爸爸
Who am I kidding? I'm not ready to be a dad.

430
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,910
我曾一度觉得我可以  但
I thought that I was, but it's, like...

431
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,820
我爸爸就从来不会干这种傻事
my dad never did stuff like that, you know?

432
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,220
如果他做过呢
So what if he did?

433
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,290
你依然那么爱他
You'd still love him.

434
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,920
老实说  难道你不想偶然发现一个视频
And be honest-- wouldn't you love to stumble onto a video

435
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,360
是你自己老爸全裸狂奔在大街上  大声嚷道
of him running down the street naked, yelling,

436
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,130
马修  快看我
"Hey, Marshall, look at me!

437
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,360
我的大腿内侧有一根大冰柱
I got an icicle on my deal!"

438
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,170
各位好啊
Oh! Hey, guys!

439
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,840
哎呦  我的脖子
Ow! My neck!

440
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,910
你们看
Look at that.

441
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,440
巴尼  你在这儿干嘛
Barney, what are you doing here?

442
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,950
我告诉诺拉  除非她愿意跟我再次约会
Oh, I told Nora I wouldn't leave

443
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,450
否则我要一直呆在这儿
until she gave me a second date,

444
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,920
我可是很认真的哦
and I mean it.

445
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,320
我已经在这儿呆了九个小时了
I've already been here nine hours.

446
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,020
再给我点时间考虑考虑
I still need another minute.

447
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,260
可能你们会觉得我很疯狂  但是
I mean... call me crazy, but

448
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,560
我一定要在这儿  把那个女孩等回来
I'm gonna stay here until I get that girl back.

449
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,460
那  那就是我想要的
That-- that's what I want.

450
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,230
巴尼对诺拉的执着

我不想在两个女孩间摇摆不定

我觉得我的老板刚在性骚扰我

但是他看了视频  他却不当一回事
