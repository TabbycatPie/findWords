1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,640
We got a package from my dad.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,700
No air holes in the box.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,370
That's a good sign.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,970
Lily loved having that chicken.

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,680
One more time than she realized.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,260
Listen, I just got an e-mail from our wedding singer.

7
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,680
- He has a small request.   - Another one?

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,040
Since when does the wedding singer send us requests?

9
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,300
Well, no, he just wants to change a few songs in your medley

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,180
to avoid overlap with the stuff that he's performing.

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,980
Well, I hope it's none of my showstoppers.

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,590
Oh, they're all showstoppers.

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,050
Oh, you're too kind.

14
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,070
Oh, my gosh, it's us.

15
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,860
For our wedding cake.

16
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,100
Couldn't you just die?

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,500
I really think I could.

18
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,080
My dad made this.

19
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,700
He's a world-class soap carver.

20
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,210
You know, once, when I was a kid, I cussed,

21
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,430
and my mom washed my mouth out

22
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,340
with the leaning tower of Pisa.

23
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,180
She still blames herself to this day.

24
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,940
Oh, I would have nixed that wedding topper immediately,

25
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,690
but Cam and I have an agreement.

26
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,520
We -- we each got three vetoes of each other's wedding ideas --

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,090
No questions asked.

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,000
And it -- it worked for...a while

29
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,100
I think you're gonna love my wedding board.

30
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,980
I'm pretty excited, too.

31
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:00,770
- Veto.   - Veto.

32
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,630
- Veto.  - Veto.

33
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:05,660
I'm sorry I'm so emotional.

34
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,360
It's just the nicest thing ever.

35
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,560
You don't think that I look just a little bit --

36
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,140
I mean, my dad carved through his arthritis!

37
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,240
Maybe it's the kicky leg.

38
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,590
I mean, the hours his ruined hands put into this.

39
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,070
He found us in soap.

40
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,420
Today, mitchell, I know love.

41
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,820
I no love, either.

47
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,880
Thanks.

48
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,990
I'm helping Gloria sell the old apartment

49
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,050
that she and Manny lived in before she met Jay.

50
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,440
It's in an up-and-coming neighborhood

51
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,980
with a distinct multicultural bent

52
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,440
that's undergoing an exciting urban renewal.

53
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,300
That's a fancy way of saying "The gays found it."

54
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,410
I can't believe that I lived here for five years.

55
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,250
Even turning the lights on was a pain.

56
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,500
Look at this.

57
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,040
Keep it down, you bitch!

58
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,000
Ay. Mrs. Rivera's still alive.

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,100
I am really digging this place.

60
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,920
Right?

61
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,450
The gas stove, the moldings --

62
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,920
they don't make 'em like this anymore.

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,850
I'll probably gut it.

64
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,370
Rip it out.

65
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,650
That's what I'd do.

66
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,370
I want my contractor to swing by,

67
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,540
but I really like it.

68
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,250
Great. All right. Thanks.

69
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,720
- Bye-bye.  - Talk to you soon.

70
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,850
So nice to meet you.

71
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,730
I'm not selling to him.

72
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,970
What? Really?

73
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,120
He's a quality buyer.

74
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,840
You're tired of finding renters.

75
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,890
This is a family building.

76
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,350
Generations have lived there,

77
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,350
and usually at the same time.

78
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,360
He just wants to flip it.

79
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,580
Okay.

80
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,410
I got a backup I can probably get here in an hour.

81
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,890
You want to wait in there?

82
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,580
You walk in that door,

83
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,080
you never come out.

84
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,830
No, no, not the bar -- the coffee shop.

85
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,670
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

86
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,470
But we can wait next door.

87
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,620
That's my old hair salon where I used to work.

88
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,340
You can get drinks there, too.

89
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,260
Gloria!

90
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,700
No, no, no, it's not Jay.

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
What's so funny?

92
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,820
What's so funny?

93
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,630
She thinks you're my lover.

94
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,100
That is funny!

95
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,030
I don't know if it's "a room full of women laughing" funny,

96
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,740
but...

97
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,890
Ay, Rita, no.

98
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,510
Phil is a friend of mine,

99
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,280
and we're just killing time before an appointment.

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
I hate to ask, Gloria,

101
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,640
but my new girl hasn't shown up.

102
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,070
Any chance you could help?

103
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,700
Ay, of course!

104
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,950
It will be so much fun!

105
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,010
I don't want to ruin my nails.

106
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,950
Phil, would you do my shampooing?

107
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,980
Well, I-I guess so.

108
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,780
We've got the time.

109
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,500
Just a warning --

110
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,620
I haven't shampooed professionally since college,

111
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,860
and that was only part-time to pay for my cheer gear.

112
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,460
Wow. That was super-braggy.

113
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,580
What do we got, double sinks?

114
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:52,060
What's the nozzle sitch?

115
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,650
Not to sound too braggy,

116
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,600
but your mom was kind of

117
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,500
a badass at work this week.

118
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,450
It was hard enough with grandpa being sick

119
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,020
and me suddenly in charge,

120
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,720
but it was just one crisis after another.

121
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,110
Luke, honey, we're going!

122
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,470
Fire in the warehouse,

123
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,090
surprise inspection from OSHA,

124
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,010
our biggest buyer tried to pull out of a deal,

125
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,870
and I have to talk him off a ledge.

126
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,870
Whatever. It's over now.

127
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,600
I don't want to bore you guys with this stuff.

128
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,860
So, when I get to work on Wednesday,

129
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,220
Margaret is ready in tears,

130
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,890
and there are two cops in the waiting room,

131
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,740
and I say to them,

132
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,490
"One of you had better be able to drive an 18-wheeler,

133
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,300
"because I've got 100 rosewood panels to get to Victorville,

134
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,020
or it's coming out of my paycheck."

135
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,430
I told you guys about the drivers and the bad tuna?

136
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,330
- Bad tuna, - Yes.

137
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,530
- yeah. - Yes, I did.

138
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,950
Hey, mom, I forgot how fun this car was.

139
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,970
And these automatic doors and that TV in the back.

140
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,420
You know what else was fun?

141
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,590
The party they threw for me at work on Friday.

142
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,100
I mean, it was a little bit embarrassing.

143
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,270
I didn't even know "She-ro" was a word,

144
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,010
and there it was, in icing.

145
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,710
Hello, hello!

146
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,180
Welcome to Jay's night.

147
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,950
Names, please.

148
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,850
Want to make sure you're on the list.

149
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,420
Kidding! Just excited.

150
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,810
Appetizers on the bar,

151
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,390
scrabble on the coffee table,

152
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,260
and our feature presentation,

153
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,100
"The Great Escape."

154
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,980
Speaking of which, Haley...

155
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,060
Don't worry, grandpa.

156
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm not leaving.

157
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,010
I have no plans for the night.

158
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,830
Me, either.

159
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,260
But when I say it, it's news.

160
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,410
When you say any complete sentence,

161
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:09,920
it's news.

162
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,610
Okay, girls. Dad, you feeling better?

163
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,420
You had a rough week, huh?

164
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,870
Nah. I'm fine.

165
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,410
Looks like you had a big week.

166
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,450
You heard about that?

167
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,090
Yeah, I got the blow-by-blow on all the office drama.

168
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,870
By the way, sincerely...

169
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,680
Yeah?

170
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,710
...great...

171
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,380
great guacamole on the bar, there.

172
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,440
Wow. That's it?

173
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,490
Everything you did for him,

174
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,250
and he doesn't even say "Thank you"?

175
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,110
I get it.

176
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,370
It's "Hero" with a "She."

177
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,450
Okay, I'm up to speed.

178
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,820
Yeah, that was cold.

179
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,060
It's just his way.

180
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,480
After years of disappointment,

181
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,860
I have learned not to expect a pat on the head from my dad.

182
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,210
He's not capable of it.

183
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,410
But it has taught me a very important lesson

184
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,250
that you girls should learn, too --

185
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,720
approval comes from within.

186
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,670
I knew that, mom.

187
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,190
'Course you did, 'cause you're smart.

188
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,250
Hey, is Lily out of the tub?

189
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,530
We got to be at my dad's soon.

190
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,720
Oh, no!

191
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,440
It's not that big of a deal.

192
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,400
We can be a little late.

193
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,090
No! Lily had the cake topper

194
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,960
in the tub with her!

195
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,480
Oh, no. How could such a terrible mistake have occurred?

196
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,910
I think she must have just thought it was a toy or something.

197
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,930
Well, I hope it's not completely ruined forever.

198
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,150
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?

199
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,530
My daddy uses a special shellac on this thing.

200
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,970
This is water-resistant,

201
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,860
heat-resistant -- you name it.

202
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,420
Good to know.

203
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,450
Yeah, but put it someplace safe.

204
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,410
It could still be slippery,

205
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,120
so be careful.

206
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,630
Is it?

207
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,230
Oh, yeah, it is!

208
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,090
It's slippery!

209
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,230
Is it okay?

210
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,160
Not a scratch.

211
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,910
Apparently, I'm tougher than I look.

212
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,200
Hey, boys. Having fun?

213
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,950
You know it.

214
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,550
Love us some Jay's night.

215
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,800
Okay, we're out of here.

216
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,960
Kristy Hughes,

217
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,690
A.K.A. "Kristy huge ones,"

218
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,090
is having a pool party two blocks away.

219
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,800
What about Jay?

220
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,070
He thinks we're at a party.

221
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,050
He'll never know.

222
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,540
We sneak out, work the room,

223
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
cannonball, cannonball,

224
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,030
and we're back in time for dinner.

225
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,080
Were you even invited?

226
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,180
No.

227
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,930
But that's only because I don't know her or any of her friends.

228
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,430
We're not invading her house.

229
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,570
Besides, this hair at a pool party --

230
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,580
One dunk, and it goes off like an airbag.

231
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,820
What's this? You made sauce?

232
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,460
Well, you were sick.

233
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,980
I didn't know if you could handle it.

234
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,570
Back in Vietnam, I had hepatitis.

235
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,380
Still managed to cook Thanksgiving dinner

236
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,850
for 300 soldiers.

237
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,460
I think I can handle sauce.

238
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,150
Well, I saved you the trouble.

239
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,410
So, Margaret tells me I'm using some new delivery trucks now.

240
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,350
Yeah. They're hybrid.

241
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,640
Now, they cost a little more,

242
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,710
but when I factored in the tax rebates

243
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,280
you get for going green,

244
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,130
we come out ahead.

245
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,700
Speaking of "Green,"

246
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,590
you went a little heavy on the vegetables, huh?

247
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,140
I'm not sure I can stomach anything that's healthy.

248
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,560
Gosh, mom, that truck thing sounds so amazing.

249
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,830
Yeah!

250
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,150
It's fine, dad.

251
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,430
Only do what we're capable of, right?

252
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,010
Oh, damn.

253
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,610
No, Stella, stay. No.

254
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,180
Good girl.

255
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,570
Thank you, Stella.

256
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,770
Thank you for listening.

257
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,470
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

258
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,430
Who's my best girl?

259
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,280
Don't.

260
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,510
Okay, girls, we are ready for scrabble.

261
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,450
I'll grab some snacks.

262
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,710
Uh, potato chips, please.

263
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,930
Oh, so I can hear about how much

264
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,600
you hate yourself all night?

265
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,580
Hello, Luke.

266
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,290
Come on! We've got to go!

267
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,980
That party's full of sophomores.

268
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,250
Those women have lived.

269
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,670
No, we're going back inside,

270
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,490
we're eating Jay's food,

271
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,890
and we're playing his board games.

272
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,480
More like boring games.

273
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,510
They're already called "Board."

274
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,200
You don't make it more clever by --

275
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,330
Never mind.

276
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,140
Okay. Thanks.

277
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,000
Did you work everything out with the wedding singer?

278
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,580
Oh, yeah -- I'm just dropping my big finale

279
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,970
because he's doing the same song.

280
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,960
"My Way"?

281
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,840
His way.

282
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,500
Hey, guys.

283
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,190
Sorry we're late,

284
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,860
but we come with wine.

285
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,830
And whittlin'!

286
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,340
Check it out.

287
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,510
This is a beautiful gift my father made

288
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,310
for the top of our wedding cake.

289
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,820
I guess he ran out of soap before he got to me.

290
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,750
- Darn. - For you.

291
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,860
Ladies, check out

292
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,230
your uncle Mitch and Cam in soap.

293
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,390
That's soap?

294
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,940
It's beautiful.

295
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,590
This is my worst nightmare.

296
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,560
You shouldn't have blown through those vetoes.

297
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,810
This is how Cam's dad sees me --

298
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,530
like some fawning damsel.

299
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,960
If anything, Cam's the damsel.

300
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,130
Dad!

301
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,130
Thank you.

302
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,540
A lot can happen before the big day.

303
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,310
Believe me, I've already tried.

304
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,250
That thing is indestructible.

305
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,090
What if it went missing?

306
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,200
Things disappear around here all the time.

307
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,340
Do they?

308
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,210
All the time.

309
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,280
Let's just say I have a friend

310
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,080
who helps me in these kinds of situations.

311
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,930
I'm listening.

312
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,970
The less you know, the better.

313
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,370
I'm not listening.

314
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,430
We never had this conversation.

315
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,890
This is a non-versation.

316
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,950
Right.

317
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,660
I am giving you the...no-ahead.

318
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,230
Oh, I miss you girls.

319
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,580
Nobody in my white family thinks that I am funny.

320
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,090
Honey, Hector had a life before he met you.

321
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,870
So I have to eat dinner with his ex?

322
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,550
Well, you certainly don't want him going alone --

323
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,160
Not with his history.

324
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,040
Who are you really mad at?

325
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,650
Ay, I don't know.

326
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,270
Come on, Luisa.

327
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,720
Raul!

328
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,870
Hector's going to hurt me just like Raul did!

329
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,900
There it is.

330
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,840
But Hector isn't raul, okay?

331
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,260
They're just cousins.

332
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,970
We need to get a move on.

333
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,950
The client's gonna come over to the apartment at 4:00.

334
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,060
I am swamped. I can't just leave.

335
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,720
Gloria, we're here to sell your apartment.

336
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,870
We don't work at the salon.

337
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,120
It's for a young couple with a baby on the way.

338
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,830
They're not flippers.

339
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,030
They're looking for a place to settle down and make a home.

340
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,870
Okay, just move them.

341
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,580
If they really want it, they'll come back.

342
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,530
But, Gloria --

343
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,660
Ay, please, just help me with Anna's foils.

344
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
I have a weave emergency!

345
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,870
Something's not right.

346
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,360
No, no, no, not with you. You look great.

347
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
You know who's gonna hate this,

348
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,390
is a certain jealous sister.

349
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,980
Cinco de my, oh, my.

350
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:09,240
How am I supposed to do this with so many "I"s on my rack?

351
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,300
Sorry.

352
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,150
Where's Luke?

353
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,670
How long does it take him to get the dictionary?

354
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,550
We described it for him perfectly.

355
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,510
Wait a minute.

356
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,880
He's not coming back.

357
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,110
Ugh. Move your "S."

358
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,800
I-I'm going as fast as I can.

359
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,770
Mitchell! It's gone!

360
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,450
What is?

361
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,860
The cake topper.

362
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,370
Lily, have you seen the little daddies

363
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,450
you were bathing with earlier?

364
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,670
Don't say that.

365
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,200
I saw Stella playing with it.

366
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,330
What?

367
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,690
Oh, look at her. She's all muddy.

368
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,560
She must have brought it outside and buried it.

369
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,770
She does it all the time!

370
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,350
Oh, no. We have to go find it.

371
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:38,850
Good luck.

372
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,810
That thing's as good as gone.

373
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,330
Dang it!

374
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,610
And the worst part is,

375
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,220
we don't even have a picture of it.

376
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,820
Do we?

377
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,690
Okay, we can't give up.

378
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,190
Let's go out into the yard and look for it.

379
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,580
Careful. I wouldn't come between Stella

380
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,680
and anything she's buried.

381
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,630
She's a wild animal.

382
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,170
No telling what she'll do.

383
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,810
That's a very aggressive stance.

384
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,920
Luke! Wait!

385
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,570
Oh. Look at that.

386
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,270
You left your yard,

387
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,890
and your little shock collar didn't go off.

388
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,390
Luke --

389
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,320
Okay, so, here's the new plan.

390
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,850
You hang back while I break the ice,

391
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,830
and then, when the time is right --

392
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,830
Manny! You made it!

393
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,720
Who's this?

394
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,140
"Who's this?"

395
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,970
Excuse me,

396
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,510
Kristy huge ones, I have a name.

397
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,700
Okay, come on. Stop.

398
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,050
I'm tired of chasing you all day.

399
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:29,890
Then don't.

400
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,370
Stay as long as you want at that lame party.

401
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,450
You want to talk?

402
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,030
You're the dorky sidekick, not me.

403
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,390
Want to talk nicer?

404
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,090
How could you be invited and I wasn't?

405
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,470
I don't know.

406
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,700
It's like the stuff that used to make me kind of weird,

407
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,010
people are starting to like.

408
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,250
So?

409
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,350
I'm the same as I always was.

410
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,090
Well...maybe you could upgrade a little.

411
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,150
Uh, we're tired of the yoda voice,

412
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,840
and if a girl tells you she went to london,

413
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,360
maybe don't ask if she also saw France.

414
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,370
I liked things better when you were the one

415
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,960
who was ostrich-sized.

416
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,770
What?

417
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,420
You know, like a freaky outsider --

418
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,130
the way an ostrich feels around regular birds.

419
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,760
You know what else girls like?

420
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,620
The mysterious, silent type.

421
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,230
What are you doing with my sauce, there, cookie?

422
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,420
That's yours.

423
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,130
This is mine.

424
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,210
I prepped it this morning.

425
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,420
I figured, why not make it?

426
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,020
Um...maybe because I already made sauce?

427
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,030
Can't have too much.

428
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,850
Can't ya?

429
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,240
Hand me that ladle, huh?

430
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,710
What are you doing? I got it.

431
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,650
What do you say?

432
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,670
What?

433
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,640
What do you say when somebody does something for you?

434
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,260
What do you say?

435
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,010
You want me to thank you for handing me a ladle?

436
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,800
You thanked the dog for staying --

437
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,850
which is basically doing nothing --

438
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,900
so I know you know the words.

439
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,770
Fine.

440
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,910
Thank you for handling me the ladle.

441
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,210
You sure those are ready?

442
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,360
You didn't throw one against the wall.

443
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,910
Oh, dad, nobody does that anymore.

444
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,720
Oh. I guess we have new ways for doing everything now, huh?

445
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,800
No. I didn't say that.

446
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm just saying that you can taste your food

447
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,560
instead of flinging it at the wall like a chimp.

448
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,650
Okay.

449
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,970
How's it taste?

450
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,880
Actually, mm, that's pretty good.

451
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,620
But it could use a little,

452
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,350
um...sauce.

453
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,290
Let me just -- ooh, hot.

454
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,990
Try a little Parmesan with that?

455
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,480
I should probably get that bread in the oven.

456
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,540
Just...

457
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,920
Okay! Hey!

458
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,750
Hey, how about we take over in here

459
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,860
while you two get cleaned up for dinner?

460
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,180
Yes, good idea.

461
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,530
Yeah. Okay.

462
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,940
Approval comes from within.

463
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,990
Thank you.

464
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,660
Your sauce needs garlic.

465
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,960
- Okay.   - Okay.

466
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,700
And that's a clock.

467
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,850
Okay, well, do another one.

468
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,030
I've done like four.

469
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,720
This dog is a worse hoarder than your uncle Clayton.

470
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,860
He's a collector.

471
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,370
Of expired yogurt?

472
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,940
Getting tired.

473
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,310
Cam, can we just stop, please?

474
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,210
I feel like we've done our best,

475
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,820
but we're just not gonna find it.

476
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,970
Found it!

477
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,710
Oh! Good.

478
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,270
Thank god.

479
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,690
I hadn't even told you my biggest plan for this yet.

480
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,050
Bigger than the top of our wedding cake?

481
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,520
I'm gonna have a mold made of it and give a reproduction

482
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,790
to everyone who comes to the wedding

483
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,380
and everyone who can't come to the wedding.

484
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,280
Imagine hundreds of these across the country.

485
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,260
No!

486
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,680
No! No! Absolutely not!

487
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,940
I hate it! It's awful!

488
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,880
I knew it!

489
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,970
I knew it!

490
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,750
It just shows up in Lily's bath,

491
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,950
and then, all of a sudden, the dog has it?

492
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,400
You have it in for this beautiful topper.

493
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,230
Look at this. Look at it. Look at it!

494
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,950
Come on, you're all heroic and Paul Bunyan-y,

495
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,610
and I'm -- I'm, like, some sissy man

496
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,940
with -- with pinkish cheeks and a turned-out heel.

497
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,800
It's a caricature.

498
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,610
What matters is what it represents.

499
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,330
My daddy making this for us

500
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,370
means he's accepted us for who we are!

501
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't you get that?

502
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,880
I never really thought about it that way.

503
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,190
No. You hadn't.

504
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,310
I'm just being sensitive.

505
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,820
I need to have a thicker skin.

506
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,830
I-I'm really, really sorry.

507
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,530
No, don't -- don't -- don't be sorry.

508
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,600
No.

509
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,430
And I -- n-- I don't want something at the wedding

510
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,610
that makes you uncomfortable.

511
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,840
Well, no, that doesn't seem fair.

512
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,930
I've used up all my vetoes.

513
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,320
Well, if it --

514
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,790
I guess, if it makes you feel better,

515
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,190
I could give you one more veto --

516
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,600
if you give me one more, too.

517
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,300
Okay, sure.

518
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,310
And in the future,

519
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,080
if there's anything --

520
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,400
The wedding singer.

521
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:17,720
Okay. Thanks, daddy.

522
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,930
I'll send you the perfect picture to model it on.

523
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,630
After today, I'm convinced

524
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,830
our landfills are 10% hair.

525
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,920
Oh, yes.

526
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,680
I forgot how exhausting this is.

527
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,470
Well, all we have to do

528
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,130
is meet the clients back at the apartment,

529
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,160
and then we can head home.

530
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,940
Ay, no. I'm too tired now.

531
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,140
Let's reschedule.

532
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,340
Really? Again?

533
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,670
Yes. Let's meet them next week.

534
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,280
And besides, we're late for Jay's party.

535
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,910
Well, I'm not letting you go home looking like this.

536
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,630
You're a little ratty back here.

537
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:50,820
Ay, no.

538
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,340
No, no, no. I got it.

539
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,230
You just relax.

540
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,740
What a day, huh?

541
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,410
Being back here must bring up a lot of memories.

542
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,540
Oh, yeah.

543
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,320
Maybe even some emotions.

544
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,760
Yeah. It feels weird.

545
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,690
No, weird's an adjective,

546
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,440
not an emotion, but go on.

547
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,120
Well, it's just that my life now is so different than before --

548
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,480
so much easier.

549
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,960
And that makes you feel...?

550
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,040
Good.

551
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,290
And also...?

552
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,510
And bad.

553
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,580
Why?

554
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,610
I don't know.

555
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,860
Come on, now, Gloria.

556
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,430
I don't know.

557
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,870
I guess it just makes me feel a little ashamed.

558
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:30,670
Now, what in the world do you have to be ashamed of?

559
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,380
It's just that, you know,

560
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,000
before, when I used to live here,

561
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,630
I used to work for every penny.

562
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,120
I would stand on my own two feet.

563
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,260
Now I just stand on expensive shoes

564
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,310
that Jay buys for me.

565
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,610
Is that why it's so hard to let go of the apartment?

566
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,580
No, Phil, it's not that --

567
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,820
Gloria.

568
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,120
Maybe.

569
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,160
Gloria.

570
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,100
Yes.

571
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,560
It's the last piece of the old me.

572
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,760
No, no! You're going too deep!

573
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,230
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

574
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm sorry, but I think you're looking at this all wrong.

575
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,240
The old you hasn't gone anywhere.

576
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,900
I-I-I see it in the way you're raising Manny and Joe,

577
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,710
the way you care for Jay.

578
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,800
You never take anyone or anything for granted.

579
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,180
You worked hard for years

580
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,290
without knowing that things were gonna get better.

581
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,350
And then the universe rewarded you.

582
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,210
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

583
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,910
So you're not mad at me

584
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,930
because I don't want to sell the apartment?

585
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,000
No.

586
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,070
You'll know when you're ready,

587
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,450
and I'll be here.

588
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,400
Aw, Phil.

589
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,350
You're the best.

590
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,670
There's no one like you.

591
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,870
Claire, that looks so good.

592
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,330
I can't wait to try it.

593
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,570
Thank you.

594
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,360
Something has happened here.

595
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,700
Well, you'll all be happy to know

596
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,270
that our search for the cake topper

597
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,430
unearthed a number of family treasures.

598
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,110
Come on, Cam. We're eating over here.

599
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,120
Wait.

600
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,180
Didn't I give you this for Father's Day?

601
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,140
And that.

602
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,630
You see how this dog is?

603
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,900
My karaoke microphone.

604
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,120
Jay, check it out!

605
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,950
The other walkie-talkie!

606
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,150
Shame on you, Jay Pritchett!

607
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,140
You have used this dog to bury the things that you hate.

608
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,740
- What? - Yeah!

609
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,450
Since when do you need help burying things?

610
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,100
Calm down. She buries stuff of mine, too. Look.

611
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,450
Everybody at the office bought me this clock last month.

612
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,150
Honey, what's the matter with you?

613
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,080
That's a question that maybe you should answer.

614
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,880
Oh, my gosh! My headphones!

615
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,490
That's the worst.

616
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,360
"Here's to 40 years in the business.

617
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,390
Enjoy your new timer, old-timer."

618
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,690
Suddenly, it made sense.

619
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,710
In my dad's mind,

620
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,340
I was reaching for a torch he wasn't ready to pass.

621
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,330
Sure, someday,

622
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,550
I'm gonna take over his business,

623
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:46,950
but not tonight.

624
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,280
Tonight is still Jay's night.

625
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,200
So, dad...

626
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,610
turns out,

627
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,850
I did have a bunch of questions for you last week,

628
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,700
but I didn't want to bother you with them.

629
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,570
I didn't want you to think I couldn't handle it.

630
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,820
There's no shame in asking for help.

631
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,110
You can always call.

632
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,490
Well, I won't need to.

633
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,090
You'll be in the office down the hall, right?

634
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,540
Right.

635
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,810
Goldilocks to Papa Bear.

636
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,930
Goldilocks to Papa Bear.

637
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,400
Come in, Papa Bear.

638
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,810
This is Papa Bear.

639
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,180
On location in the garage, Papa Bear.

640
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,740
Got some cocoa with your name on it.

641
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,960
What's your 20?

642
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,420
Oh, what the hell?

643
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,210
What's going on?

644
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,330
The kids unfriended me again.

645
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,740
How am I supposed to know what's going on in their lives

646
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,010
If they never talk to me?

647
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,040
Honey...

648
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,950
I got this.

649
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,550
Yeah. It's been kind of a rough year.

650
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,030
New school,

651
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,100
new kids,

652
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,660
and now I'm taking advice about girls

653
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,590
from a kid who has his own shoe buffer.

654
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,720
What?!

655
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,540
I tried beer.

656
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,540
Wow, dad. This feels great.

657
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,800
Good. Good.

658
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,030
You're-- you sure there's --

659
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,680
there's nothing on your mind?

660
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,880
No.

661
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,920
Why do you ask, dad?

662
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,590
You seem upset about something.

663
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,730
It's just, you reach a certain age,

664
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:12,580
and you start to wonder,

665
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,470
"Am I everything I wanted to be?"

666
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,490
I mean, am I selling houses,

667
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,810
or am I just selling out?

668
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,710
Anything else?

669
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,190
Alex tried beer.
