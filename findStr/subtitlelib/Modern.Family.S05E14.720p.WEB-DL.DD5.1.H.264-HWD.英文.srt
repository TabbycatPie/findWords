1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,530
Okay, gang.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:06,130
Tonight, the Farewell to VHS Festival continues.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,620
It's been mighty cold in here since "The Big Chill."

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,560
What say we warm our hearts by...

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,500
"St. Elmo's Fire"?

6
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,980
Yes!

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,620
Couple of wine coolers and some '80s Rob Lowe--

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,700
I can get into that.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,050
I'm still holding out hope I'll have plans tonight.

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,580
Great. Two for two. Haley?

11
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,840
Oh, so fun, but I'm gonna have to say no.

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,320
I have a photography-class thing.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,250
What kind of a thing?

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,420
Oh, you know, just an exhibit,

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,930
like, to show our photos.

16
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,180
Is it something that we should go to?

17
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,560
Claire, we just made plans.

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,200
Mom, this is a college class.

19
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,720
I'm not in the third grade.

20
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,860
Don't you have nap time there?

21
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,700
No. I have free periods,

22
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,890
during which I sometimes nap.

23
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,910
Is it me, or was she just being purposefully vague?

24
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,450
Alex, I want you to go through her stuff

25
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,490
and find out about this thing tonight.

26
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,170
Wait, wait.

27
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,320
I-I don't feel good about us snooping.

28
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,530
I know. That's why I told Alex to do it.

29
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,240
I think Haley knows more than she's letting on.

30
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,430
It breaks my heart how badly you want to believe that.

31
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,800
We'll see you guys later.

32
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,580
Where are you going?

33
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,980
Riding our bikes to Xander's.

34
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,950
What are you doing there?

35
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,390
I don't know. Hanging out.

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,990
Sounds fun. Wear your helmets.

37
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,630
We will.

38
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,240
I'm not writing my first novel by blowing through a tube.

39
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,510
I don't like them going over to that kid's house.

40
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,170
Why not?

41
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,250
Mm, Xander's a bad influence.

42
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,680
His older brother is even worse.

43
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,290
Huge stoner always walking around

44
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,720
in his army jacket with his muscles,

45
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,100
flipping his hair out of his blue eyes.

46
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,310
He told me I was looking good one time.

47
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,600
I mean, come on.

48
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,710
Yeah, we'll keep our eye on that.

49
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,330
But for now...Xander. I don't trust him.

50
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,010
Claire, you're a tough one to figure out.

51
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,670
You don't trust bad boys, and yet you married one.

My handsome boy's so hungry.

57
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,020
All right. Be back in a few.

58
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,370
If Shorty calls, tell him I died,

59
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,140
but make sure you really sell it.

60
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,230
It's a funny thing we're doing.

61
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,200
How is that funny?

62
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,920
I knew you'd say that.

63
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,870
Just don't answer the phone. Bye, buddy.

64
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,730
What's all that about?

65
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,050
You mad at me or something?

66
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't know.

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,640
Did you do something to make me mad?

68
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,610
Because then I am.

69
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,310
But if you didn't, then I am not.

70
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,290
I didn't do anything.

71
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,600
Then I am not mad.

72
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,800
I am mad.

73
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,640
Last night, Jay had a sexy dream about some woman.

74
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,230
Baby.

75
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,330
Oh, baby.

76
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,070
Oh, baby!

77
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,300
And I know it wasn't about me,

78
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,760
Because he knows that I hate when men call me baby.

79
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,660
And, yes, people are allowed their private thoughts,

80
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,670
and I shouldn't be so angry,

81
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,150
But I am latin, so I get to feel whatever I want.

82
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,790
You want to tell me what I did?

83
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,320
Do you want to tell me what you did?

84
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,250
I don't know what I did.

85
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,800
Then I don't know what you did.

86
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,540
I'm bored. I'm going.

87
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,940
Don't forget your phone.

88
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,410
I got a bruise on my arm.

89
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,390
I don't know where it came from.

90
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,380
Oh, poor baby.

91
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,930
And then I realized

92
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,490
I don't want to work for Charlie anymore.

93
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,270
What I really want --

94
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,050
I'm sorry. I can't listen to this.

95
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,220
I need to tell you something,

96
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,790
but you have to keep it a secret.

97
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,850
Of course. I'm a lawyer.

98
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,310
I've heard murder confessions.

99
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,540
- Really?   - Well, in --

100
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,570
in mock trials at law school.

101
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,110
But still, I never told anyone.

102
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,840
Seriously, this is only for you.

103
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,360
You can't even tell Cam. Promise?

104
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,850
Uh, okay.

105
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,200
Is everything all right?

106
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,350
Look under the table.

107
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,810
Above the ankle, below the knee, what do you see?

108
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,220
I'm a little nervous about this, but --

109
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,170
Oh, oh, my gosh! You didn't?

110
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,700
I did. Calf implants.

111
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,340
Wow, and you really went for it, didn't you?

112
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,800
No, no, no. They're still swollen.

113
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,380
And that's why you're wearing sweat pants.

114
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,500
Okay, I was --

115
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,080
I was afraid you'd just given up.

116
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,050
So, whew!

117
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,010
They'll settle.

118
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,940
I'm gonna start casually referencing my new workout plan,

119
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,280
and then I'm gonna debut them

120
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,090
memorial day at Laguna beach.

121
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,660
I personally don't think that you needed them,

122
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,010
but if they make you happy --

123
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,960
- They do. - Good.

124
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,550
I always wanted to be

125
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,000
one of those guys running in tights,

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,610
but I was too embarrassed about my legs.

127
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,650
Well, if you'd just gone running --

128
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,290
Yep. You're overthinking this, Mitchell.

129
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,500
No joke, you can't tell Cam.

130
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,760
I love him, but he is a giant blabbermouth.

131
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,770
Oh, come on. He's not that bad.

132
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,730
He just -- yeah, no, I can't even sell that.

133
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,380
Jay, to what do I owe the pleasure?

134
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,530
I'm just here to pick up Manny.

135
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,190
No need for a whole thing.

136
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,810
I don't know why I do that to him.

137
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,640
The guy's always so happy to see me.

138
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,190
I'm not gonna worry about it.

139
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,560
Manny's not here.

140
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,910
He actually went with Luke over to Xander's.

141
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,800
Whoa! Manny didn't tell you he was going either?

142
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,570
I told you, those boys are being cagey.

143
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,340
There is a chance

144
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,390
Gloria let me drive over here for nothing as punishment.

145
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,060
I think she snooped on my phone,

146
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,350
read some of my e-mails.

147
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,230
That's not cool. E-mails are private.

148
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,280
They were from a friend I loaned money to.

149
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,370
- 100% your prerogative. - A woman.

150
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,500
Oh, no.

151
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,930
Well, I'll tell you what I'd do.

152
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,040
I'd tell my lady,

153
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,940
"You got no business being in my business."

154
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,860
Respect your man's boundaries.

155
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,050
Honey, you promised

156
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,940
you'd clean the pan if you made brownies.

157
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,650
Well, maybe I forgot to spray it first

158
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,450
and I'm letting it soak, woman.

159
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,770
He only talks like this when you're around.

160
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,960
Well, then, he's done for the day.

161
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,470
Oh, okay. Good.

162
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:10,910
- Bye, dad. - See ya...buddy.

163
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,760
I have tracked Luke's cellphone,

164
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,940
and he is nowhere near his friend Xander's.

165
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,680
Honey, I love technology as much as the next Wozniak,

166
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,460
but are we sure we want to be spying on our kids?

167
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,020
No, and you also shouldn't try to friend us

168
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,590
with fake Facebook profiles,

169
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,750
Margot LaCroix.

170
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,520
I was really hoping some

171
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,150
of this would go away when you got a job.

172
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,580
How about I just ask him?

173
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,240
Oh, man.

174
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,570
I wish you were my dad.

175
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,050
The things I would have done.

176
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,350
- Hello? - Hey, buddy.

177
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,520
Just making sure you got to Xander's okay.

178
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,900
Yep. All good.

179
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,890
Really? 'cause I hear traffic...

180
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,630
...and Xander lives on a pretty quiet street, right?

181
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,990
Actually, we left Xander's,

182
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,390
and now we're at Sammy's.

183
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,120
Well, that makes perfect sense.

184
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,920
You have fun. Be safe.

185
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,370
He's lying.

186
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,220
Look. His friend Sammy lives here.

187
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,120
He's all the way over on Olympic and 20th.

188
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,530
Olympic and 20th?

189
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,230
That's the old salvage yard

190
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,590
where kids go to get high.

191
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,510
- What?! - No.

192
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,830
Oh, we are going there right now.

193
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,250
Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?

194
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm gonna answer, and then I'm gonna walk away.

195
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,400
Deal?

196
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,360
Okay.

197
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,330
I'm 420% sure.

198
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,080
Wow, she's bad at math.

199
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,440
Hey, guys.

200
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,630
Hi, daddy.

201
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,600
How was lunch?

202
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,010
Oh, it was fine.

203
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,630
Hey, when did salmon become a thing that we put on salad?

204
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,750
2008 in the city, 2011 in the suburbs.

205
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,040
How was Brett? What's the drama du jour?

206
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,810
Nothing.

207
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,800
Oh, please. It's never nothing with that one.

208
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,700
His perm, the stalker he pretends to have,

209
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,150
nobody will date you when you work at the I.R.S.

210
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,160
I hate it. What was it this time?

211
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,690
No, seriously, nothing.

212
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,490
I guess it is nice to have something other than chicken

213
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,620
to throw on there.

214
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,830
Okay, why are you being so evasive?

215
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,940
I'm not being evasive. I--

216
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,480
Check out this new tie.

217
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,830
Oh, my gosh.

218
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,370
You are redirecting me,

219
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,510
like we do when Lily asks us a question

220
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,200
we don't want to answer

221
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,670
and just throw a doll in her face.

222
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,940
Wait a minute.

223
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,890
Don't be ridiculous.

224
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,370
Like I could do that with an adult.

225
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,610
Check out what I got for you.

226
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,160
Oh, good, yes. A garlic press.

227
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,040
I am so tired of my fingers smell--

228
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,210
Oh, my gosh. You did it again.

229
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,290
- What's that? - Oh, it's got to be good.

230
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,150
- What?!  - Tell me.

231
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,030
- No, nothing.  - Tell me.

232
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,280
- There's nothing to tell!  - Tell me.

233
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,470
- There's nothing to tell! - Tell me, tell me,

234
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,120
tell me, tell me.

235
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,260
Here. Answer me.

236
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,650
How does santa claus get to all of those houses?

237
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,330
Okay, sweetie, the adults are talking right now,

238
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,180
And look what daddy brought you.

239
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,290
Mitchell, when somebody tells me something,

240
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,530
I can't wait to get home and tell you.

241
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,740
Don't you feel the same?

242
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,740
Of course I do.

243
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,230
But he -- he made me promise.

244
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,200
Well, you know what? We don't have to share secrets.

245
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,820
We don't.

246
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,460
We already share a house, a life,

247
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,430
a daughter.

248
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,390
You know what?I don't --

249
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,830
I don't know why I care so much.

250
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,720
Okay, all right, okay.

251
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,530
He got calf implants.

252
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,030
Oh, my god! Oh, what do they look like?

253
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,060
Like he's smuggling two grapefruits.

254
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,940
Which, by the way, were also on my salad.

255
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,180
Okay, this is huge. This is huge.

256
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,520
Who all knows? We have to host a brunch.

257
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
Don't you dare tell a single person, okay?

258
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,400
He made me promise not to tell anyone, especially you.

259
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,470
- Especially me?   - Oh, please.

260
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,410
Everybody knows you're terrible at keeping secrets.

261
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,340
Okay, well, I didn't know that was my reputation.

262
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,490
Maybe that's a secret people have been keeping from me.

263
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,580
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

264
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,360
Well, you did.

265
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,820
And you know what the sad thing is?

266
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,330
We could be laughing at someone's calf implants right now.

267
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,990
Hey, what are you doing?

268
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,580
I'm just watching you sleep.

269
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,290
You look so pretty.

270
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,800
Okay, but don't breathe so loud.

271
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,650
Hey, where are you going?!

272
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,870
I can't find a way in.

273
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,150
I can't see anything,

274
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,490
but I hear them laughing.

275
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,930
And you know why kids laugh.

276
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,950
Because their hearts are filled with joy, not suspicion?

277
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,640
We have got to see what is going on in there.

278
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,100
Get the drone thing out of the car.

279
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,500
That "Thing" is a professional aerial-photography tool

280
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,180
for real-estate use only!

281
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,340
You used it at the beach to film yourself doing sand angels.

282
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,460
For my "Phil Dunphy Will Get You

283
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,870
a Heavenly Deal On a Beach House" video.

284
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,300
A professional real-estate tool!

285
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,970
That was the consensus.

286
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,060
Hey, Alex. What did you find out?

287
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,380
Okay, this is a bigger deal than Haley let on.

288
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,620
Only five people in her class

289
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,800
were picked to show their photographs,

290
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,030
And haley was one of them.

291
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,540
Amazing!

292
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,270
Are there more than five people in the class?

293
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,760
Yes. That's the first thing I checked.

294
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,630
Then we really do have to be there.

295
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,800
Call uncle Mitchell and grandpa and see if they can join us.

296
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,320
She didn't catch you snooping, did she?

297
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,380
No. She's taking a nap.

298
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,420
She's been taking a lot more naps lately.

299
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,060
See what you can find out about that.

300
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,450
This is so wrong.

301
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,300
Eh, well, desperate times call for desperate --

302
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,990
What is on your head?

303
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,470
It provides glare protection, but apparently not from you.

304
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,810
Let's just do this.

305
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,740
We are airborne.

306
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,430
Expertly navigating the wires.

307
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,200
You're right.

308
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,290
We have cleared the wall. Approaching target.

309
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,850
There they are.

310
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,830
What are they doing?

311
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,680
They're jumping around on stuff.

312
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,690
Do you see anything suspicious, like, um --

313
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,370
like smoke or paraphernalia, nachos?

314
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,500
No, they're filming each other

315
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,800
and moving around like zombies.

316
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,020
Honey, they're not getting high.

317
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,860
They're making a movie... without me!

318
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

319
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,860
Then why would luke have lied

320
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,930
about going to Sammy's, huh?

321
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,460
Honey, look.

322
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,650
Oh, god.

323
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,050
Well, he's still our little boy.

324
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:55,480
Oh, we got to get out of here.

325
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,370
He cannot know we were spying on him.

326
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,550
- Come on. - Too late.

327
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,830
It's too late. They're pointing at the drone.

328
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,990
- What?  - We're compromised!

329
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,670
Get out, get out!

330
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,430
I can't leave the drone!

331
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,810
It belongs to the office!

332
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,790
They're still mad at me for writing

333
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,150
on the dry-erase board with a permanent marker!

334
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,360
Get in the car.

335
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,330
Go, go, go!

336
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,090
What was that thing?

337
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,370
Somebody was filming us.

338
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,070
Hey, my dad has one of those.

339
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,230
I know what's going on here.

340
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,350
A movie studio is trying to steal our idea!

341
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,470
Spielberg.

342
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,650
I told you guys, zombie parkour is a million-dollar idea.

343
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,790
I still don't get it. Zombies don't move well.

344
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,930
Vampires, maybe.

345
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,230
Plus, there's your title -- "Vam-par-kour."

346
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,240
I don't hear it.

347
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,000
Look at that.

348
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,530
That's how I like to be greeted when I come home!

349
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,550
It turns out Manny's hanging with his friends today,

350
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,080
so I didn't need to go pick him up.

351
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,760
Oh, right. So sorry. I forgot to tell you.

352
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
But, then, you don't tell me everything,

353
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,280
so I guess it's okay.

354
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,040
You got a lot of nerve.

355
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,390
You are the one who went through my emails on my phone.

356
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,220
What are you talking about? No, I didn't.

357
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,490
So you're not mad at me for something you found on my phone?

358
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,400
No.

359
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,580
All right, then. Great.

360
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,340
No harm, no foul.

361
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,850
I'll see you at dinner.

362
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,440
Give me that phone!

363
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
I want to see what you're hiding!

364
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm not hiding anything.

365
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,100
I don't even know how to use the damn thing.

366
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,810
Oh, look. I accidentally dialed Alex.

367
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,160
Let me say hi to her. The kid idolizes me.

368
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,480
Hi, hon.

369
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,420
Hi, Grandpa.

370
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,940
Real quick, how do I delete e-mails on my phone?

371
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,660
Well, first, you have to check your inbox,

372
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,360
your trash folder, and your sent folder.

373
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,270
People often forget about the sent folder.

374
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,720
Trust me, you get pretty adept at this

375
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
when you have to stay one step

376
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,470
ahead of your snooping mother.

377
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,700
Give me the phone.

378
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,470
Got to go.

379
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,160
Uh, yeah, sure. I-I-I have nothing on here.

380
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,490
Let me just disconnect from grandpa,

381
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,360
which is not happening right now.

382
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,600
I can see what you're doing, Alex.

383
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,710
Why did just delete a text from uncle Mitchell?

384
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,680
I didn't!

385
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,590
Shouldn't you be more worried

386
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,710
that Haley has a nurse's uniform in her closet?!

387
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,580
I can only handle one thing at a time.

388
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,910
- Hey, Claire. - Hey, Mitchell.

389
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,160
Why would Alex delete a text from you off her phone?

390
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,380
I'm not answering that question.

391
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,380
People's phones are their own business.

392
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,580
What?

393
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,500
I got to go. Give me your phone.

394
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,460
No. Why?

395
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,560
Because you're texting someone

396
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,250
and you look very guilty right now.

397
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,890
Or I'm playing "Words with friends"

398
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,240
with Longines.

399
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,300
None of those words better be "Calf" or "Implants."

400
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,740
Oh, my gosh. Here. You know what?

401
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
Take my phone...

402
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,760
and admit that you don't trust me,

403
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,400
Your fiance, and co-father of your daughter.

404
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,140
Go ahead.

405
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,880
Push the button.

406
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,050
I'm good. No, I'm fine. I trust you.

407
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,140
Oh, my gosh!

408
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,840
Hey, guys.

409
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,770
You want some red stuff that reminds you of wine?

410
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:46,140
- Sure. - Yep, I do.

411
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,140
So, when's this exhibit open?

412
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,300
I don't know. Maybe the details are in Jay's phone.

413
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,120
But I hope not,

414
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,610
because everything is very secret on there.

415
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,300
Don't know if you caught that subtle cue.

416
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,520
She's mad at me.

417
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,560
He did something very terrible

418
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,860
that he doesn't want me to know about.

419
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,790
"Very terrible"?

420
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,770
Until you tell me what it is,

421
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm gonna think the worst possible thing,

422
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,330
like maybe you killed somebody.

423
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,080
But you don't have the stomach for that, do you?

424
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,840
Thank you so much for coming.

425
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,200
I know how busy you all are with work and errands

426
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,020
and snarking about me on your cellphone.

427
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,050
Let it go, Claire.

428
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,490
Honestly, Phil, i don't know how you do it.

429
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,460
I don't know how you do it.

430
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,100
Compromise and compassion.

431
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,760
She wasn't really asking you.

432
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,450
Hey, hey! Here comes Luke.

433
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,500
What do we say we were doing today?

434
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,800
When has Luke ever showed any interest in what we do?

435
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,600
Okay, but be cool.

436
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,920
If he finds out you were tracking his phone,

437
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,990
he'll think we don't trust him.

438
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,030
Ooh. Plus, then I could never do it again.

439
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,880
Hey, guys!

440
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,800
What's up?

441
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,860
How was your day?

442
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,470
It was fine, you know.

443
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,610
We don't know. How would we know?

444
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,320
Oh, we just mean what did you do?

445
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,130
Not like, what did you do?

446
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,900
And we're just like, "Hey, what -- what'd you do?"

447
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,450
You guys are acting weird.

448
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,500
No, we're not. You are.

449
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,740
What did you do today?

450
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,730
- We just stayed home  - We went shopping.

451
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,520
Online shopping at home for pants.

452
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,060
We both needed pants.

453
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,640
I told you he was gonna ask.

454
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,840
Wait a minute.

455
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,330
Was that your drone today?

456
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,450
Were you spying on us?

457
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,060
I'm sorry. Your mom made me do it.

458
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,650
She thought you were smoking grass.

459
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,490
Grass? Claire.

460
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,470
No one says grass.

461
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,760
I never said grass.

462
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,460
It's not that crazy an idea.

463
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,160
We weren't smoking anything.

464
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,220
Manny would never.

465
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,000
Thank you, mom.

466
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,880
He's so judgy about those things.

467
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,940
The only reason why I walk that stupid dog

468
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,570
is so that I can smoke my cigars in peace.

469
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,210
I can't believe you were spying on us.

470
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,400
You have to stop being so suspicious, Claire.

471
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,040
It's okay to trust people.

472
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,650
Some people. Other people, who knows?

473
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,230
You turn your back for one second,

474
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,220
and they have a whole other family

475
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,330
on the bad side of town.

476
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,270
You are my other family from the bad side of town.

477
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,790
Look, I can't stand this all night.

478
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,970
I loaned someone money, Gloria.

479
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,190
I didn't consult you. I knew you'd be pissed.

480
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,430
She's just a friend.

481
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,410
"She"?

482
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,520
Is this the woman

483
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,740
that you've been dreaming about at night,

484
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,040
that you've been making the sexy noises and saying,

485
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,420
"Baby, baby"?

486
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,520
What the hell are you talking about?! No?!

487
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,930
Then prove it! Give me the phone!

488
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,360
Honestly, you people --

489
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,950
and by that, I mean straight people are ridiculous!

490
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,180
Everyone's entitled to a little bit of privacy.

491
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,730
Says the guy who forced me to

492
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,740
tell him our friend's secret.

493
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,780
Okay, that's different.

494
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,880
That was gossip,

495
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,900
- and gossip belongs to everyone.  - Okay.

496
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,520
Just keep your nose out of other people's phones.

497
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,400
You either trust them or you don't.

498
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,270
Give me that.

499
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,300
- Ha! Yes.  - Give it back. Give it --

500
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,170
No, but you can have mine,

501
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,310
'cause I have nothing to hide.

502
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,080
I'll take that.

503
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,060
Oh, my god. Mom, no, please, stop.

504
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,340
Here, here. Wait. Let me help you.

505
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,980
It's crazy, right?

506
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,960
Ha ha. No, I knew it.

507
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,760
"L.O.L.

508
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,400
Do you think Brett likes his coffee black

509
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,490
or with calf-and-calf?"

510
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,480
Okay, I admit it. I have a problem.

511
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,580
But I only told one person. It was too juicy.

512
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,440
And Crispin said he wouldn't tell anyone.

513
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,610
This is from Longines.

514
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,500
Oh, that lying Crispin. Give me that.

515
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,300
I cannot believe he betrayed my trust.

516
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,470
Now Pepper's chiming in.

517
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,440
Jackals, all of them.

518
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,570
Oh, that Pepper.

519
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,210
Oh, my g--

520
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,160
Uncle Mitchell was helping you get me a birthday present?

521
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,490
Yeah, I wanted to make you dinner

522
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,190
and get you a nice bottle of wine,

523
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,520
The one he served at new year's

524
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
you said you liked.

525
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,500
Ooh, I did like that wine.

526
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,350
I'm sorry I ruined the surprise.

527
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,410
You should be.

528
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,830
What did you think I was doing, anyways?

529
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,100
Give me some credit.

530
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,540
Oh, well, then, maybe we could just call it even,

531
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,670
since he typed, "I'm just surprised

532
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,750
She remembered coming to my house that night."

533
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,060
To which you responded, "Bahahahahahaha"

534
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,240
with like five exclamation points.

535
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,910
Seems fair.

536
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,070
Did you find what you were looking for?

537
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,060
No.

538
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,160
She's a waitress at the club.

539
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,830
Her boyfriend crashed her car, so I helped her,

540
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,020
because we have that fun game where I order salad

541
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,460
and she brings me french fries.

542
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,920
But I never dreamt of her.

543
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,850
Last night, I had a nightmare.

544
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,720
Joe got out onto a ledge of a tall building.

545
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,000
I couldn't get to him.

546
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,270
I was very upset,

547
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,930
and I think I might have cried a little in my sleep,

548
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,650
which might have sounded like sex to you,

549
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,800
which I don't love.

550
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,000
But that's the "Baby" I was talking about.

551
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Really?

552
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,070
That's scary.

553
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,120
Yes!

554
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,240
Why in god's name

555
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,520
would I need to dream about another woman?

556
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,720
Now that you say it out loud,

557
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,860
it does seem kind of crazy.

558
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,250
I'm not proud of this, but the dream wasn't about Joe.

559
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,360
It was about this little baby right here.

560
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,350
That's right.

561
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,930
You almost fell off a ledge, and daddy was so scared.

562
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,260
Oh, my gosh. It's us!

563
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,020
All over the place.

564
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,960
I don't know how I feel about this.

565
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,850
Okay, okay, now, see -- look how much you gossip.

566
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,370
Haley managed to capture it on film.

567
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,270
And look at you, smiling ear to ear.

568
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,560
You know you love it when I give you the dirt.

569
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,690
Oh, which reminds me,

570
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,490
guess who got kicked out of a hotel bar

571
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,080
for making unwanted advances at the waitstaff?

572
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't want to know. It's none of my business.

573
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,080
Okay.

574
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,050
Jotham. Zaniel. Sal.

575
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,650
Just tell me!

576
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,610
I don't know.

577
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,430
Good god, look at those lines on my face.

578
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,920
When did I get so old?

579
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,790
Their smile lines because you're holding your son

580
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,490
who you love, who you had to protect in your dream.

581
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,850
She is a great photographer,

582
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,630
even though it's embarrassing

583
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,600
that everyone's staring at my six-pack.

584
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,060
She is really good.

585
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,310
Have you seen my photo?

586
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,810
Has Gloria seen this?

587
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,020
Gloria see what?

588
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,870
I think I look good.

589
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,650
Wow. She didn't even see me in there.

590
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,550
Oh, my god! What are you guys doing here?!

591
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,060
Alex invited us.

592
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,700
You? How did you know where this was?

593
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,610
Uh, the flier fell out of your backpack.

594
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,580
Liar.

595
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,530
Mom made me.

596
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,720
We came to be supportive.

597
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,410
I told you not to come here. This is such a violation!

598
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,470
She just did it to me, too.

599
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,550
She read my texts.

600
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,290
That's nothing.

601
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,250
She totally used a drone to spy on me.

602
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,760
Use of the drone was completely justified.

603
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,800
- What is wrong with you?! - What are you talking about?

604
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,430
All right, knock it off.

605
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,530
You have no idea how hard it is to be a parent,

606
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,400
to figure out what's going on with your kid

607
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,190
when all you get is a grunt or a "Fine"

608
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,580
or a flick of the hair.

609
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,180
It's my job to protect you

610
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,310
and make sure you're making good choices.

611
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,140
And if I step over the line every now and again

612
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,120
when I'm doing that, tough.

613
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,610
Knowing you're safe is the only thing

614
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,340
that lets me sleep at night.

615
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,830
I thought it was the wine.

616
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,220
Congratulations, Haley.

617
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:17,850
For what?

618
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,110
Someone just bought your photo

619
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,670
of this beautiful lady.

620
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,990
First one sold.

621
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,110
Oh, my god!

622
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,070
Someone paid for something that I made! Me!

623
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,050
I am so psyched we were here for this!

624
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,130
Me too!

625
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,280
Now you're glad we're here, huh?

626
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,090
I got to admit,

627
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,800
that's a gorgeous picture of you.

628
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,770
I'm in it, too, dad.
