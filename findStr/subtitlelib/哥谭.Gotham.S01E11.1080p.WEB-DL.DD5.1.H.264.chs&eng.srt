我会暂时离开  努力振作起来
I'm going away for a while, to get myself together.

去联系萨维亚诺和图斯基

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,990
他们担心自己会落得巴尼恩的下场

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,050
想扳倒我
Trying to take me down!

15

你不知道极限在哪

阿卡姆疯人院
Arkham Asylum?

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,630
去给疯子做保安

18
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,430
不是这个就得辞职了
It's that or quit.

19
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,350
那就辞职啊

他们就希望我辞职
That's what they want me to do.

[出自莎士比亚话剧《暴风雨》  朱生豪译本]
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly what I command,

26

叫你每个骨节里都痛起来
Fill all thy bones with aches,

28
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,080
叫你在地上打滚咆哮
make thee roar

连野兽听见你的呼号都会吓得发抖

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,350
到你了  上
Go, go.

31
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,430
不要
No.

32
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,040
我求求你
Pray thee.

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,030

38

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,480
贱奴  去吧

五寻的水深处躺着我的父亲*

趴下
Stay down.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,120
这是你被调派到这里后
This is the fourth inmate outburst

52
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,550
发生的第四起病人暴动了
in as many weeks as you've been stationed here.

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,590
我明白这差事对你是处罚
I understand this is punishment duty for you,

54
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,720
但我希望你仍然要有点专业水准

55
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,530
这种错误是不能容忍的  戈登
This is unacceptable, Gordon.

56
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,110
不能容忍

57
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,920
是我的错  朗先生
It's my fault, Mr. Lang.

58
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,600
这个剧目的情绪太压抑了
The play was too upsetting.

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,650
以后还是演喜剧吧
We'll stick to comedies from now on, I think.

60
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,720
谢谢你  邓肯护士

61
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,530
你可以叫我"院长"或者"朗医生"

此次谈话不涉及娱乐活动

戈登警卫负责本区的安全
Officer Gordon is responsible for security on this wing,

64
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,990
而看来他无法完成这一任务
a task which he seems unable to manage.

65
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,580
你对此有什么要说的  戈登
What have you to say about this, Gordon?

66
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,920
这个人需要医疗救助
This man needs medical attention.

67
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,470
我倒想自己治疗他
I'd see to him myself,

68
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,780
但是医院有规定
but there's rules.

69
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,480
我只负责配药  不能给人治病
I dispense meds, not treatment.

70
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,840
他需要医生
He needs a doctor.

71
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,420
那好吧
Very well.

72
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,340
我去找一个来
I'll send one in.

73
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,510
再发生事故
Any more incidents,

74
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,460
我就安排你去治疗病房轮班
and I'll have you placed on the remedial duty roster.

75
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,690
你以为这就是最糟了吗
Think you can't fall any farther?

76
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,600
那你就错了
Think again.

77
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,620
他怎么样了
How is he?

78
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,320
没事了
He's fine.

79
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,900
会好起来的

我没事
I'm good.

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,930
就几处擦伤
Few bruises.

83
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,450
怎么了
What?

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,900
你就是那个有名的警探吉姆・戈登  对吗
You're the famous detective Jim Gordon, aren't you?

85
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,640
我是叫这名  不过算不上"有名"
That's my name. I'm not sure about "Famous."

86
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,820
那"臭名昭著"呢
Notorious, then?

87
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,530
这个比较接近
Nearer the mark.

88
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,210
你是哪位
Who are you?

89
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:35,530
莱斯利・汤普金斯  汤普金斯医生

我又不是病人
I'm not an inmate.

92
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,680
以前没在医务室见过你
I haven't seen you on infirmary duty before.

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
我在女病患区上班

94
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,710
他们缺人手了我就来帮忙
I come over here when they're short-handed.

95
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,340
姑娘们都在谈论你呢

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,530
英勇警探对抗市政府  结果遭到打击

97
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,480

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,660
对不起  我不是想拿你的处境说笑
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make light of your situation.

我本人觉得你的行为很值得钦佩

101

我在保护一群疯子

102
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,070
不  你是没有放弃
No. You're not quitting.

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,990
现在还没

104
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,710
你是什么人来着
Who are you?

105
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,690
抱歉  我不是有意说这么多的
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to blurt all that out like I did.

106
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,520
不关我的事
It's none of my business.

107
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,100
汤普金斯医生
Uh, Dr. Thompkins,

108
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,740
你确定这个病人没事吗
you sure this inmate's gonna be okay?

他没事
He's fine.

110
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,330
药劲上来了  需要休息

-不行  -我们付的够多了

153
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,810

Don Maroni set the rates last year.

154

只能怪通货膨胀
Inflation is a bitch.

156
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,550
马罗尼说了
Maroni said...

157
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,030
马罗尼  马罗尼
Maroni, Maroni....

158
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,730
你有点惹到我了
You're beginning to irk me.

159
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,400
你在跟我说话  企鹅
You're talking to me, the Penguin.

160
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,530
你是企鹅
So you're Penguin.

161
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,750
那又如何
So what?

162
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,460
我还向警察举报你了呢
I called the cops on you.

163
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,780
是企鹅大人
It's The Penguin.

164
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,700
还有  打电话什么的  太天真了
And that was a very naive call to make.

165
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,520
码头区的警察是我们的人
Hello, we own the cops on the waterfront.

166
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,430
跟警察说去吧  伙计
Tell that to the cops, buddy.

167
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,870
伙计们
Boys.

168
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,990
苦着脸干嘛
Why the frowns?

169
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,010
琼斯
Jones?

170
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,360
琼斯
Jones.

171
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,000
蛙人
Frogman.

172
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,730
哥谭
第一季  第十一集

173
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,700
这是电击伤痕
These are electrode wounds.

174
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,890
有人对他进行了原始的侵入性的电击疗法
This man was given a crude, invasive kind of electroshock therapy.

175
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,990
用金属针插入大脑
Metal needles were inserted into the brain

176
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,250
直接对额叶进行电击
and electricity was applied to his frontal lobes.

177
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,050
为什么
What for?

178
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,180
电击手术是用来纠正异常行为的
Surgically, it's used to modify aberrant behavior,

179
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,180
但他被施以了太高的电压
but in this case, way too much voltage was used

180
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,100
他的大脑已经完全烧坏了
and his brain is completely fried.

181
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,310
又是在你的监管下  戈登
Another under your watch, Gordon?

182
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,110
这是怎么发生的
How did this happen?

183
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,710
你仓促开门
You rushed into opening,

184
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,180
现在这栋两百年的大楼
and now you're running this place

185
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,600
不安全  四处透风  活像迷宫
with skeleton staff and zero surveillance

186
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,470
人手不够  连监控都没有
in an unsafe and unsecure 200-year-old maze.

187
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,610
太好了  满身借口
Excellent. Excuses.

188
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,170
市政工程就是如此
That's that nature of municipal operations.

189
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,250
接手问题
You inherit problems

190
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,930
然后用手边有限的资源尽力而为
and you use the resources at hand to do with you can.

191
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,400
咱们的资源完全不够
Well, our resources don't stretch nearly far enough

192
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,710
展开暴力犯罪调查
to cover a criminal assault investigation.

193
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,160
咱们应该通知哥谭市警局
We should call the GCPD.

194
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,500
不  这是内部医疗问题
No, this is an in-house medical issue.

195
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,090
他还喘气吗
He still breathing?

196
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,300
是的  不过实际上他已经脑死亡了
Well, yes, but he's effectively brain dead.

197
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,110
那怎么...
What does...

198
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,890
他还能喘气
He's still breathing.

199
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,470
无需机器维持生命
Unaided.

200
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,220
那从官方角度来说
For all official purposes, well,

201
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,160
他还活着
he's still alive.

202
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,420
照顾好他  医生
Keep him comfortable, Doctor.

203
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,080
戈登警卫
Officer Gordon?

204
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,770
你去查明是哪位可爱的病友干的这事
I want you to find out which one of our charming inmates did this.

205
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,110
周五把报告放在我桌上
I want a report on my desk Friday.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,390
又是个寻常的工作日
Another day, another dollar.

207
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,590
是吗  我倒觉得这不寻常而且很蹊跷
Really? This is rather usual and sinister, isn't it?

208
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,870
是啊
Yes.

209
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,380
我们该找什么样的人
So, who are we looking for?

210
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,720
做出这种事需要什么条件
What does it take to pull this off?

211
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,400
基础的人体解剖学知识
Some basic knowledge of human anatomy.

212
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,110
基础电工技能
Basic electrical skills.

213
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,660
电路板和几根电线
A circuit board, some wiring.

214
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,570
就这些
Is that all?

215
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,690
当然还需要门钥匙
And the door keys, of course.

216
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,840
门钥匙
"The door keys."

217
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,120
没错
Right.

218
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,500
没有啊  我的钥匙都在呢
No, man, I got my keys right here.

219
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,380
看着我  斯蒂文
Look at me, Steven.

220
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,390
看着我
Look at me.

221
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,560
告诉我实话
Tell me the truth.

222
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,970
你干吗针对我
Why you picking on me?

223
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,910
有五名警卫都有这一区的钥匙
There's five other guards with keys to this wing.

224
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,550
没错  但只有你一个
True, and you're the only one who looks

225
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,520
一副紧张兮兮的样子
and smells like a hunted animal.

226
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,010
斯蒂文  电了蛙人的人有钥匙
Look, Steven. Whoever fried Frogman had keys.

227
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,840
我们搜了所有病人的病房
Now, we've searched all the inmates' cells.

228
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,070
都没找到钥匙
No keys.

229
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,620
但是我知道钥匙被盗了
But I know they're out there.

230
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,090
我要查到在哪
And I need to know where.

231
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,050
我已经无路可走了
I'm backed up against the wall here.

232
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,810
而且我开始失去耐心了  你明白吗
And I'm starting to lose my patience-- do you understand?

233
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,260
看剧时发生的斗殴
That fight... during the play.

234
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,730
就在那之后  我发现我的钥匙不见了
Right after, I noticed my keys were gone.

235
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,480
丢钥匙可是大事
You lose equipment, that's a big deal.

236
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,480
会扣我一周的工钱  所以我去找了副备用的  
They dock me a week's pay, so I tracked done a spare set!

237
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,880
谁把钥匙拿走了
Who took the keys?

238
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,930
我不知道
I don't know.

239
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,400
谁都有可能
Anyone could've taken them.

240
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,400
走开
Walk away.

241
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,210
-抱歉  -走开
- Sorry... - Walk away!

242
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,660
他的钱炸飞了
And then he raises our taxes

243
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,560
就来提我们的税
after his money blows up.

244
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,550
还冷血无情地杀了巴尼恩
Killed Bannion like he was nobody.

245
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,590
我直说了
I'll say it.

246
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,070
那老家伙法尔科内来找我们麻烦前
I wish something would happen to old man Falcone

247
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,770
但愿他能出点意外
before he comes after one of us.

248
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,190
我就这意思
That's where this is going.

249
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,460
别急  我们来想象一下
Slow down. Now, let's imagine

250
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,440
上帝保佑法尔科内长命百岁
God forbid anything happened to Falcone.

251
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,860
但只是说着玩
Just for kicks...

252
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,600
到时谁来接手呢
who would take over then?

253
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,810
谁来接手
Who would take over?

254
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,990
我来
I do.

255
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,020
你
You?

256
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,270
这我倒从未想过
Now, that never occurred to me.

257
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,450
从未想过什么
What never occurred?

258
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,490
论资排辈  下一个也该轮到我
I'm next in line. Seniority.

259
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,350
规矩就是如此
That's the way the system works.

260
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,110
这是以前的规矩
That's how the system used to work back in the day.

261
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,840
现在是个新的开端  新的城市
It's a new dawn, a new city.

262
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,220
我觉得我们需要新思想的人来带领我们
I would believe we would need some fresh thinking at the top.

263
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,940
那么你说的是哪位新思想的人呢
And who is the fresh thinker that you got in mind?

264
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,120
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

265
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,910
是谁
Who?

266
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,940
她呗
Her.

267
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,550
她指的是她自己
She's talking about her.

268
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,190
是嘛
Really?

269
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,990
你认为我无法管理整个家族吗
You don't think I could run the family?

270
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,140
不是  为什么不行呢
Hey, no, why not?

271
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,980
妇女解放什么的嘛
Woman's lib and all that.

272
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,170
但是公平说  下一个该轮到吉米
But fair play, Jimmy is next in line.

273
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,900
没必要起争执
Well, there's no need to argue.

274
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,180
这本来也都只是假设
It's all hypotheticals anyhow.

275
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,110
我们只是随便说说
We're just talking, right?

276
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,190
5075号病人杰克・格鲁伯
Inmate 5075 Jack Gruber.

277
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,730
病人格鲁伯
Inmate Gruber?

278
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,420
你拿了威戈警卫的钥匙吗
Did you take Officer Wenger's keys?

279
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,480
你在调查蛙人的不幸遭遇
You're looking into the sad demise of the Frogman.

280
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,410
-蛙人昨晚破坏了你的演出  -是的
- The Frogman disrupted your play last night. - Yeah.

281
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,680
你很讨厌他  是吧
You didn't like him very much, did you?

282
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,440
我对他没什么看法
Well, I had no opinion of him.

283
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,670
他被称作蛙人
He was called the Frogman

284
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,940
是因为他认为有只巨大的牛蛙寄居在他的腹中
because he believed a giant bullfrog lived inside his abdomen,

285
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,620
掌控着他的思想
controlling his thoughts.

286
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,100
他已经死了
He was already dead.

287
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,850
我才不把精神能量浪费在死人身上
I don't waste psychic energy on the dead.

288
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,530
强奸  谋杀
Rape, murder...

289
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,880
你惯用暴力啊  格鲁伯
You're no stranger to violence, Gruber.

290
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,740
你的精神评估显示你是个A类反社会者
Your psych evals say you're a grade-A sociopath.

291
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,770
我为什么要相信你的话
Why should I take your word for anything?

292
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,190
你不该对读到的东西全单照收  吉姆
You shouldn't believe everything you read, Jim.

293
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,580
我能叫你吉姆吗
May I call you Jim?

294
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,790
-是你拿的钥匙吗  -请吧
- Did you take the keys? - Please,

295
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,870
如果你不信任我  就去搜我病房吧
search my cell if you do not find me trustworthy,

296
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,690
但是  吉姆  我没有拿任何人的钥匙
but, no, Jim, I did not take anyone's keys.

297
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,150
谢谢你
Thank you.

298
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,970
警卫
Guard?

299
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,680
你拿了威戈警卫的钥匙吗
Did you take Officer Wenger's keys?

300
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,190
没有
No.

301
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,290
冷静
Settle down.

302
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,250
冷静  冷静
S-Settle down. Settle down.

303
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,450
你拿了警...
Did you take Off...

304
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,510
钥匙在你那儿
You have the keys?

305
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,070
拿束带  我需要束身衣
Get the straps! Need a restraint!

306
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,070
-钥匙  -没错
- Keys? - Yes.

307
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,730
钥匙  你拿警卫的钥匙了吗
Keys. Did you take the guard's keys?

308
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,260
没有  我惹麻烦了吗
No. Am I in trouble?

309
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,070
没有  艾伦
No, Aaron,

310
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,970
除非你在撒谎
unless you're lying to me.

311
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,280
撒谎
Lying?

312
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,000
艾伦从不撒谎  戈登先生
Aaron never lies, Mr. Gordon.

313
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,670
他没有这个概念
He doesn't have the concept,

314
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,940
真是个可怜的家伙
poor peaceful soul that he is.

315
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,720
他拿斧子杀了他全家
He killed his family with an axe.

316
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,330
是这样吗  艾伦
Isn't that what you did, Aaron?

317
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,940
除此之外连只苍蝇都没伤害过
Never harmed a fly before or since.

318
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,870
我道过歉了
I said sorry.

319
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,950
艾伦
Okay, Aaron.

320
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,480
你可以走了
You're free to go.

321
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,600
谢谢你  警卫
Thank you. Guard?

322
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,600
看到了吧
You saw how that went.

323
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,200
问题在于萨维亚诺
Saviano's the problem.

324
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:40,020
亚纳切克如果落单  我就能搞定
Now, on his own, Janacek, I can turn him around.

325
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,890
小混混就都跟着去了
And the junior capos will follow him.

326
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,590
但是萨维亚诺
But that Saviano,

327
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,880
咱们得在出击马罗尼之前就搞定他
we got to deal with him before we make our move on Maroni.

328
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,340
不如让我跟萨维亚诺谈谈
Why not let me talk to Saviano on my own?

329
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,110
我和吉米是老交情了
Me and Jimmy go way back.

330
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,230
的确  你俩是老交情了
That's true. You do go way back.

331
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,790
你会跟他说什么
What would you tell him?

332
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,370
我会说你是最好的人选
I'd say you're the best candidate.

333
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,820
他也知道
He knows that.

334
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,940
只是不愿当面承认
He just can't admit it to your face.

335
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,190
太骄傲了
Too proud.

336
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,410
那好
Okay then.

337
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,460
去跟他谈
Talk to him.

338
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,710
没问题
Will do.

339
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,510
布奇
Butch,

340
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,110
你没打算背叛我吧
you're not turning on me, are you?

341
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,580
这算什么意思
What kind of question is that?

342
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,250
你怎么能开这种玩笑
Why would you even joke about something like that?

343
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,760
问问而已
I'm just asking.

344
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,950
女人家有时就是没安全感
A girl gets insecure once in a while.

345
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,290
罗伊斯顿  你在这儿干吗呢
Royston, what are you doing out of your cell?

346
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,680
够了
Hey, cut it out!

347
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,970
五寻的水深处躺着你的父亲
Full fathom five thy father lies.

348
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,160
他的骨骼已化成珊瑚
Of his bones are coral made.

349
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,660
见鬼
Aw, hell.

350
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
你是叫罗伊斯顿吗
Royston, is that your name?

351
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,500
海的女神时时摇起他的丧钟
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.

352
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,710
好精彩
Fascinating.

353
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,390
他能走能说
The poor man can walk and talk,

354
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,580
但只记得剧本里的台词
but all he remembers are lines from the play.

355
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,280
用的是跟蛙人相同的电击疗法
Same electroshock technique as Frogman

356
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,150
但结果较温和
but with slightly less drastic results.

357
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,810
看来不管是谁做的  那人在改进方法
It's like whoever's doing this is improving their methods.

358
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,330
或许那人毫无计划
Or maybe their process is so haphazard,

359
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,540
自己都不知道会是什么结果
they don't know what kind of outcome they're gonna get.

360
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,420
一个成了植物人
One man ends up a vegetable,

361
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,150
另一个反复背诵莎士比亚
while the other one recites Shakespeare on a loop.

362
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,090
真不明白病人这么折磨病人
I don't understand what an inmate gains

363
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,350
能有什么好处
from scrambling up another inmate.

364
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,840
这段时间你最好留在女病患区那边
You should stay on the female wing for a while.

365
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,410
你没必要让自己涉险
There's no reason to put yourself in danger.

366
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,460
我能照顾好自己
I'm perfectly capable of protecting myself.

367
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,860
再说  病人也需要我
Besides, my patients need me.

368
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,760
这边可能要出大乱子
There's gonna be some drama around here.

369
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,100
钥匙丢失引导我去查病人
The missing keys made me focus on the inmates,

370
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,710
但我觉得这是个误导
but I think it's a misdirection.

371
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,770
我觉得应该排查员工
I think I should be focusing on the staff.

372
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,200
我明白了
I see.

373
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,800
那还真是要出乱子了
There will be some drama.

374
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,020
不过等等  我也是员工啊
But, wait, I'm staff.

375
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,980
说不定就是我呢
What if it's me?

376
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,720
-不是你  -你怎么知道
- It's not you. - How can you tell?

377
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,780
-你不是那种人  -警察的绝招吗
- You're not the type. - Cop skills, huh?

378
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,160
会读人
You can read people.

379
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,280
一部分人而已
Some people.

380
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,600
是员工  太荒唐了
A staff member? That's absurd.

381
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,680
-是病人干的  -我觉得不是
- It was an inmate. - I don't think so.

382
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:58,750
你的工作是监督病人的安全
Your job is to oversee inmate security.

383
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,010
你无权对员工进行调查
You're not authorized to conduct an investigation of the staff.

384
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,560
你是想向我施压
You're trying to force my hand.

385
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,370
你想逼我报警
You want me to call the police.

386
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,200
不是
No.

387
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,590
我已经报了
I already called 'em.

388
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,960
芭芭拉  起床了
Barbara, you need to wake up.

389
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,600
早上好
Morning.

390
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,380
我给你买了咖啡
I got you coffee.

391
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,340
加糖特甜
Mmm, extra sweet.

392
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,860
你一直记得
You always remember.

393
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,580
是啊
Yeah.

394
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,320
联系吉姆了吗
Have you spoken to Jim recently?

395
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,320
为什么要联系他
Why would I?

396
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,550
芮妮  你不需要吃吉姆的醋
Renee, you don't have to be jealous of Jim.

397
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,280
我不爱他了
I'm over him.

398
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,180
这是个错误
This was a mistake.

399
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,400
什么是错误
What was?

400
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,950
我们
This. Us.

401
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,670
我不该放任我们发展到这一步
I should have never let it go on for this long.

402
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,850
对不起
I'm s... I'm sorry.

403
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,280
我明白了
Oh, I-I see.

404
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,790
听我说  芭芭拉
Look, Barbara...

405
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,170
不用说了  我明白...
No. No. I mean, you're...

406
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,390
你说的一点没错  这是个错误
No, you are absolutely right. This-this was a mistake.

407
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,590
我已经戒瘾很久了
This has been a really long process for me,

408
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,220
我一直努力使自己重回正轨
and I've worked too hard to get right with myself.

409
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,200
我希望我们能重归于好  但我不能重蹈覆辙
I-I wanted this to be good, but I can't fall back now.

410
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,170
酗酒  嗑药
The drinking, the drugs.

411
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,760
我们在互相毒害
We're toxic together, you and me.

412
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,620
求你了  芮妮  别说了
Please, Renee, stop.

413
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,020
一个字都不必多说了
There's no need to say another word.

414
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,350
对不起  我影响了你的戒瘾
I am sorry that I interfered with your process.

415
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,350
芭芭拉  你需要帮助
Barbara, you need help

416
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,480
但我帮不了你
I can't give you right now.

417
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,010
-我帮你打给吉姆吧  -不
- Let me call Jim for you, please. - No.

418
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,010
我的钱包呢
Where's my purse?

419
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,730
你不必走  留下
You don't need to go. Stay here.

420
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,160
给自己一点恢复的时间  我走
Take time to get yourself together. I'll go.

421
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,570
我现在就很好  多谢劳神
I am perfectly together, thank you.

422
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,330
我不就是害人的毒药嘛
I am just toxic, that's all.

423
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,440
该死的钱包到底在哪
Now, where's my damn purse?!

424
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,700
芭芭拉  别这样
Barbara, stop.

425
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,770
请你冷静一点
Calm down, please, all right?

426
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,300
我走
I'll go.

427
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,590
求你了
Please.

428
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,110
好吧
Fine.

429
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,900
随你吧  走
Do what you want. Go.

430
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,490
-对不起  -走吧
- I'm sorry... - Just go.

431
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,250
你好  哥们
Hey, pal.

432
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,660
在一朵莲香花的冠中我躺着休息
In a cow slip's bell I lie,

433
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,830
我安然睡去  当夜枭开始它的呜咽
there I crouch when owls do cry.

434
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,810
挺好
All right.

435
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,420
挺美的
I can dig that.

436
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,750
-警探  -吉姆
- Detective... - Jim!

437
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,540
老搭档  亲一个
Partner. Mwah!

438
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,940
让我好好看看你
Let me take a good look at you.

439
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,730
老天保佑  当警卫了
Lord have mercy, a screw.

440
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,980
-你怎么回事  -边儿去没空理你
- Excuse me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

441
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,660
你还真没唬人啊
Hey, you weren't exaggerating.

442
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,390
跟你说的一样诡异
Freaky as advertised.

443
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,190
我没让任何人叫你来  先生
Nobody of authority called on you, sir.

444
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,640
这不是警察的事
This is not a police matter.

445
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,480
想必你就是院长朗医生
You must be Director Dr. Lang.

446
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,120
我就不同意你的话
See, I beg to differ.

447
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,910
这最起码是一起三级袭击案件
This is third degree assault, at the very least.

448
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,140
这是你哥们吧
A friend of yours, is it?

449
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,290
你这是极其严重的抗命行为
Egregious insubordination.

450
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,540
你的饭碗已经岌岌可危了
Your job here was already hanging on a thread.

451
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,530
你的执法生涯就到此为止了
This is the end of your career in law enforcement.

452
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,250
等着瞧吧
Count on it.

453
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,700
你悠着点  大哥
Take it easy, hot shot.

454
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,120
戈登警卫的做法是正确的
Officer Gordon did the right thing.

455
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,480
为什么他不能叫警察
Why wouldn't he call the police?

456
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,880
没准别人会以为你不希望把事情搞大呢
Anyone would think you'd want to keep this business quiet.

457
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,860
杰瑞  你是叫杰瑞是吧
Gerry... it is Gerry, isn't it?

458
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,610
我问你  这是你做的好事吗  杰瑞
Now, did you do this terrible thing, Gerry?

459
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,790
这问题简直不值得回答
That doesn't even merit a reply.

460
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,050
不  这不是我做的好事
No, I did not do this terrible thing.

461
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,570
但你是医生  你有这个技术
But you have the skill, though, as a doctor.

462
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,370
你肯定能做得干净利落
I mean, you could do it, lickety-split.

463
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,580
我为什么要这么做
Now, why would I do this?

464
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,620
别人又是为什么呢
Why would anyone?

465
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,350
说得好  戈登警卫
Exactly, Officer Gordon.

466
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,350
杰瑞  恐怕我得请你去局里走一趟了
Gerry, I think we're gonna have to take you down to the precinct

467
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,150
你身上的嫌疑实在太大
you're raising a lot of questions

468
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,380
必须得正式讯问清楚才行
that need clearing up in a more formal setting.

469
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,800
-你不能强迫我去  -闭嘴
- Well, you can't do this... - Sh-Sh-Sh-Shush.

470
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,980
从此刻起  哥谭市警局正式接手调查此案
As of this moment, this is an official GCPD investigation.

471
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,770
你要是不配合  就等着被捕吧
You, sir, will cooperate or face arrest.

472
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,810
戈登警卫
Officer Gordon?

473
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,980
能不能麻烦你过一遍工作人员档案
Would you mind going through the, uh, staff records

474
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,410
我要带这位杰瑞去喝杯茶了
while I take Gerry, here, downtown for a chat?

475
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,650
遵命  警探
Will do, Detective.

476
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,520
走吧
Sir?

477
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,210
吉米
Jimmy.

478
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,530
布奇
Butch.

479
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,890
见到你很高兴
Good to see you.

480
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,750
来
Come on.

481
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,680
就跟过去一样  是吧
Like old times, huh?

482
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,560
就差来一瓶苹果白兰地了
All we need is a bottle of applejack.

483
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,870
人生无常啊  兄弟
What happened, man?

484
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,650
在我心里  我们
In my head, it's...

485
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,550
-还是在哈洛公园追妹子的小青年  -是啊
- we're still kids, chasing girls in Harlow Park. - Yeah.

486
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,150
还真追着几个挺靓的  是吧
We caught a couple of hot ones, huh?

487
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,190
尤其是我
Especially me.

488
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:41,310
多谢你来见我
Thanks for meeting with me.

489
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,110
你怎么跟你家大姐大说的
What did you tell your boss-lady?

490
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,040
我提议约你出来谈谈  她同意了
I suggested I reach out to you. She agreed.

491
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,910
做我工作吗
Talk some sense into me?

492
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,070
说什么新开端
It's a new dawn.

493
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,270
差不多吧
Yeah, like that.

494
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,630
她说得倒没错
She's not wrong, you know?

495
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,660
市里局势变了
City's changing.

496
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,660
你真想接法尔科内的班
You really want Falcone's job?

497
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,720
我从小就把你当亲兄弟看待
Since we were kids, I love you like a brother.

498
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,160
我也是
I love you, too.

499
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,500
永远不变  你知道的
Always. You know that.

500
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,640
我知道
I do, I do.

501
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,960
所以我才信任你
That's why I trust you.

502
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,190
我现在说这话是出于对你的爱
And that's why I say to you with love...

503
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,830
菲什没戏了
Fish is doomed.

504
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,780
她接不了大位的  不可能
There's no way she gets the chair. It ain't gonna happen.

505
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,230
她是个聪明人  但她太不自量力
She's a smart cookie, but she's overreaching.

506
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,030
老实说  布奇
I mean, come on, Butch,

507
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,800
除了你和你的人  她还有什么
without you and your crew, what's she got?

508
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,210
没什么了
Very little.

509
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,890
这谁都明白  你也是
Everybody knows it. You know it.

510
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,070
也许吧
Maybe.

511
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,760
你需要什么条件才愿意动手
What's it gonna take to make you make a move?

512
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,570
你能出什么价
What are you offering?

513
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,470
随你开
Name it.

514
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,640
离开菲什  投靠我们
Drop Fish, come over to us.

515
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,760
俱乐部  和相关的生意  都是你的了
The club-- all the businesses attached-- they're yours.

516
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,680
这还只是开始  作为签约奖金
That's day one. A welcome bonus.

517
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,580
你还想要什么
What else you want?

518
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,320
问的好
That's a good question.

519
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,620
让我考虑一下吧
Let me think it over.

520
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,710
当然
Yeah.

521
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,970
兄弟
Hey, brother.

522
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,770
可别想太久
Don't think too long, huh?

523
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,400
布洛克警探
Detective Bullock.

524
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,030
等会儿
Wait here.

525
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,260
企鹅
Penguin.

526
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,490
真高兴见到你
It's good to see you.

527
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,800
过得怎么样啊
What are you guys doing?

528
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,020
老朋友
Old friend.

529
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,170
感谢上帝你来了
Thank goodness you're here.

530
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,990
这完全是出了点小误会
There's been some silly mistake.

531
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,010
一看就是
Looks like it.

532
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,710
除非你真惹恼了什么大人物
Unless you irritated someone important--

533
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,290
你没有吧
you didn't do that, did you?

534
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,120
我
Me?

535
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,020
当然没有
Of course not.

536
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,030
你确定吗
You sure?

537
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,690
好好扪心自问一下  企鹅
Examine your soul, Penguin.

538
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,200
等等
Wait!

539
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,940
别走  求你  先生  我求你
Don't go. Please, sir, I-I beg of you.

540
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,250
我家老大  马罗尼阁下
My patron, Don Maroni,

541
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,780
显然还不知道我的窘况
is obviously unaware of my predicament.

542
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,140
只要打个电话  问题肯定就能解决
A simple phone call would resolve things, I'm sure.

543
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,600
但是你看  我喜欢看你待在这儿
But, see, I like having you here.

544
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,490
这样我就可以悠闲地坐在办公桌边
'Cause I can sit at my desk

545
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,260
看着你
and look at you.

546
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,790
这让人心情愉快
It's soothing.

547
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,990
就像看一株盆栽
Like a bonsai tree.

548
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,270
盆栽是什么
What's a bonsai tree?

549
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,470
那么
So...

550
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,770
你见到我们的朋友了吗
did you see our friend?

551
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,610
见了
I saw him.

552
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,680
然后呢
And?

553
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,370
我还在劝他
I'm working him.

554
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,970
他挺固执的
He's a stubborn cuss, that one.

555
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,720
给他点时间吧
Just give him a little time.

556
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,930
时间啊
Time, hmm?

557
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,170
好啊
Okay.

558
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,110
可以给他时间
He can have time.

559
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,260
好
Yeah.

560
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,680
我很有信心
I'm optimistic.

561
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,280
很好
Good.

562
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,980
好吧  医生
All right, Doctor,

563
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,730
假装我什么都不知道
pretend I'm an ignoramus.

564
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,630
这应该不会太难想象吧
Shouldn't be too hard, hmm?

565
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,380
向我解释一下这个疯狂的电针疗法
Explain to me this whole crazy electric needle business.

566
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,510
像你这样真医生这么做时
When a real doctor like you does it,

567
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,970
会有什么效果
what's it supposed to do?

568
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,440
电击疗法是改变情绪和行为的
Electroshock therapy is a common procedure

569
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,830
普通手术
for mood and behavior alteration.

570
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,950
-像是精神控制  -差不多
- Like mind control? - Of a sort.

571
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,010
对人类进行蓝天实验
Blue sky experimentation on humans

572
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,570
被认为是不道德的
is considered unethical,

573
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,010
所以我们对其硬科学知之甚少
so we know very little of the hard science.

574
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,670
好吧
Okay.

575
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,820
不过熟练的外科医生能够引起特定的反应
But skilled surgeons can elicit very specific responses.

576
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,160
但治疗那些病人的并非熟练的外科医生
But those inmates weren't treated by a skilled surgeon.

577
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,410
你确定吗
You sure about that?

578
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,160
病人中没有熟练的外科医生
There are no skilled surgeons amongst the inmates.

579
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,190
员工中也没有
Or the staff.

580
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,610
但你是个熟练的外科医生
You're a skilled surgeon.

581
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,370
搞什么...我们讨论过这个了
What... We've been over this.

582
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,810
我从医学院毕业后就没给人开过刀了
I haven't opened a body since med school.

583
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,930
我跟你开玩笑呢
I'm just messing with you.

584
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,120
我不认为你是幕后黑手
I don't think you're the man behind this.

585
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,520
你不是破坏规矩的那种人
No, you're not the type to break rules.

586
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,280
太过害怕权威
Too scared of authority.

587
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,190
但是你有所隐瞒  是什么
But you're hiding something. What is it?

588
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,610
人人都有秘密
Well, everybody's hiding something.

589
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,960
别耍我
Don't play tag.

590
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,850
你说得对  警探
You're right, Detective.

591
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,910
我是害怕权威
I am afraid of authority.

592
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,550
而我所隐瞒的事
And the things I'm hiding?

593
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,910
我绝不会告诉你
I'll never tell you.

594
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,620
-听上去很重大  -重大
- Sounds heavy. - Heavy?

595
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,770
是的  你要是知道分寸
Yes. And if you know what's good for you,

596
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,080
就不会再去深挖
you won't dig any deeper.

597
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,010
好吧
All right.

598
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,120
我可不想触霉头
I don't want to hit any power lines.

599
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,990
这不用你说
Don't have to tell me twice.

600
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,420
不深挖  当然  除非
No digging. Unless, of course,

601
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,820
这和手头这桩案子有关
it has something to do with the case at hand.

602
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,860
毫无关联
Nothing.

603
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,960
太棒了  谢谢你
Oh. Great, thank you.

604
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,980
小可怜  你脸色好苍白
Oh, you poor thing. You look so pale.

605
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,070
找到什么了吗
Any joy?

606
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,200
还没有
Not so far.

607
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,570
档案貌似不完整
The files seem to be incomplete.

608
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,420
不知道地下室里还有没有别的
I'm wondering if there's more in the basement.

609
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,050
蓝图上说下面有个档案室
Blueprint says there's a records office down there.

610
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,950
地下室关闭了
Oh, the basement's closed off.

611
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,690
有危险化学物质
Unsafe chemicals.

612
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,550
已经十年没人下去过了
Nobody's been down there for ten years.

613
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,610
你知道怎么下去吗
Do you know the way down there?

614
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,620
假设你必须挑出你的一个员工
All right, suppose you had to pick out one member of your staff

615
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,960
作为犯人  你会选谁
as the culprit. Who would it be?

616
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,240
不是员工干的
It wasn't a staff member.

617
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,030
管他呢  你首先想到的那个人是谁
Whatever. Just the first face that pops to your mind.

618
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,200
没有人
Nobody.

619
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,290
他们都是好人  我了解他们
They're good people. I know them well.

620
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,720
他们都跟我干了五年多了
They've all been with me for more than five years.

621

625
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,820

627
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,160

你回家吧
You should go home.

638
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,430
怎么了  出什么事了
Why? What's wrong?

639
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,420
没出什么事
Nothing's wrong.

640
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,330
回家吧
Go home.

641
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,900
我不明白...
I don't understa...

642
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,260

去找正门的警卫
I need you to find the main entry guard,

645
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,160
叫他封锁整栋大楼

646
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,540
-然后马上离开这里  -好
- then get out of the building, quick. - Okay,

647

吉姆  听我说
Jim, listen,

650
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,970
桃乐西・邓肯不是员工  她是病人
Dorothy Duncan isn't staff. She's an inmate.

651
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,570
我知道  赶紧过来

吉姆  小心身后
Jim, behind you.

658
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,750
喂
Men!

659
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,900

660
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,210
给我回病房去
Go back in your cells

661
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,690
马上

00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,000
听到了吗
You hear me?

663
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,850
这是命令
That's an order!

664
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,940
记住  我食素  别加黄油
Remember, I'm a vegan-- no butter.

665
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,630

666
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,790
这是...
I-Is this...

667
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,920
吉姆・戈登在吗

668
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,520

669
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,460
不过抱歉  吉姆现在正忙呢
But I'm sorry, Jim is kind of busy right now.

670
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,440
有话要转达吗
Can I take a message?

671
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,430
不用了
No.

672
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,380
算了
No, that's okay.

673
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,430
我...
I...

674
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,770
你是哪位
Who is this?

675
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,740
我是吉姆的朋友
I'm a friend of Jim's.

676
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,180
你是谁
Who's that?

677
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,070
去死吧
Go to hell!

678
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,090
法医在停尸房验尸呢
M.E.'s got her in the morgue.

679
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,580
桃乐西・邓肯16岁在护士学院时
When Dorothy Duncan was a 16-year-old nursing student,

680
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,290
用有毒的糖果杀了5个孩子
she killed five kids with poison candy--

681
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,850
她说这是做功课
for homework, she said.

682
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,620
她半辈子都待在阿卡姆
She's spent over half her life at Arkham.

683
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,200
疯人院关闭的时候  乱成一团
When the asylum closed, there was chaos.

684
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,810
她一定是一直躲在地下室里
She must have just hunkered down in the basement

685
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,910
一直待到重开
until it reopened.

686
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,560
鉴证组在检查地下室呢
Forensics is sweeping the basement level

687
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,760
寻找她的藏身处
looking for her lair.

688
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,860
可怜人
Poor soul.

689
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,370
她究竟是想干什么啊
What was she trying to do?

690
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:07,900
谁知道呢
Who knows?

691
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,610
或许她只是想找到医治自己病症的办法
Maybe she was just trying to find a cure for her own madness.

692
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,790
她是个疯子  这就够了
She was crazy. Enough said.

693
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,380
见到你真好  吉姆
It's good to see you, Jim.

694
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,330
而且你立了功
And you got a win, huh?

695
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,730
还在为正义而战  真不错
Still fightin'. Nice work.

696
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,050
我上司估计不会这么想
Yeah, I don't think my boss is gonna see it that way.

697
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,990
他老板特别不好伺候
He's working for the king of all cheese grinders.

698
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,340
这太可惜了  警监  我们得把他弄回来
It's a crying shame, Cap-- we need to get him back on the job.

699
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,330
你知道我也非常想把你弄回来  可惜做不到
You know I'd bring you back here in a second... if I could.

700
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,620
我知道
I know.

701
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,190
没事  警监
It's all good, Captain.

702
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,250
你穿这身制服还挺像样
You do look spiffy in the uniform.

703
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,410
像傻样吧
Yeah, if spiffy means dorky.

704
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,290
谢你全家了
Thank you. Thank you very much.

705
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,010
看在过去的分上  喝杯酒吧
How about a drink for old times' sake?

706
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,340
好啊
Sounds good.

707
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,340
企鹅
Penguin.

708
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,530
先生
Sir.

709
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,360
马罗尼阁下
Don Maroni.

710
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,050
您总算来了
Thank heavens you're here.

711
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,060
你脏兮兮的
You look kind of frowsty.

712
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,940
抱歉
Forgive me.

713
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,710
从昨天早上到现在就只有张湿巾能擦擦
I've had nothing but a moist towelette since yesterday morning.

714
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,090
真是惨啊
A very sad picture.

715
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,050
你知道你为什么关在里面吗
You know why you're in there?

716
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:11,910
不知道
I have no idea.

717
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,720
这是反问
A rhetorical question.

718
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,360
你关在这儿  是我的意思
You're in there because I put you in there.

719
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,520
但是  马罗尼阁下  为什么啊
But, Don Maroni, wh-why?

720
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,420
我做了什么
What did I do?

721
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,910
你知道什么是自大吗
Do you know what hubris is?

722
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,080
知道吗
Do you know?!

723
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,690
抱歉
Sorry.

724
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,630
我以为这也是...
I-I thought that was another...

725
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,680
反问...
rhetorical...

726
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,820
呢...
question.

727
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,390
是的  我知道  自大就是...
Yes, I do. H-Hubris. It's when...

728
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,330
就是没多少斤两的小跛子
It's when limping little chickenbutt second bananas

729
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,860
当自己是个人物
think they're hot stuff.

730
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,090
-先生  -傻了吧唧的下人
- Sir... - When dumbass underlings

731
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:46,110
不问我就去提税

732
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,730
是  先生
Yes, sir.

733
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,960
还是渔民  你提渔民的税
On fishermen. You raised taxes on fishermen.

734
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,570
他们在大海里
They're out there in the freakin' ocean

735
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,300
为我们拿命冒险
risking their lives for us,

736
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,300
你敢不问我就去提他们的税
and you raise their taxes without asking me?

737
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,550
这就是自大  我的朋友
That's hubris, my friend.

738
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,020
对不起  马罗尼阁下
I'm sorry, Don Maroni.

739
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,750
非常抱歉
Deeply... sorry.

740
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,100
再不会犯了
I will never do it again.

741
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,670
好吧
All right, then.

742
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,180
你
Hey, you.

743
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,990
把我朋友放出来
Let my friends out.

744
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,920
-什么  -我说外语了吗
- Excuse me? - What, am I talking Hungarian?

745
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,480
给我开牢门
Open the cage, mook.

746
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,960
过来
Come here.

747
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,530
老天啊  你臭死了
Holy Mother, you stink!

748
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,420
这就算是教训了
Let this be a lesson to you, yes?

749
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,570
是  先生
Yes, sir.

750
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,100
你是只聪明的小猴子
You're a smart monkey...

751
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,190
但你始终是个猴子
but you're a monkey.

752
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,970
我是动物园的看守
And I'm the zookeeper.

753
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,020
没事了
Yeah, you're all right.

754
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,730
警监  你得看看这个
Captain, you should see this.

755
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,770
看
Look here.

756
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:15,140
桃乐西・邓肯  电灼伤  两边都有
Dorothy Duncan. Electrode wounds, both sides.

757
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,440
跟其他人受害人伤口尺寸一样
Same gauge as the other victims.

758
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,070
有一个月了  被头发挡着
About a month old. They were hidden by her hair.

759
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,930
这怎么会呢  她怎么能自己电自己
This is crazy-- how could she have done this to herself?

760
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,770
她不能
She couldn't.

761
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:24,170
这是人做不到的
Not humanly possible.

762
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,270
那么她也是个受害人
Which means she was just another victim.

763
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,130
她不是凶手
She couldn't.

764
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:28,350
该死
Aw, crap.

765
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,010
艾伦
Hey, Aaron.

766
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,850

What's up?

767
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,240
你哪来的钥匙
Where'd you get those...

768
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,810
好样的  艾伦
Well done, Aaron.

Exactly like I told you.

朗
Lang?

773
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,200
朗
Lang!

774
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,760
他们跑了
They're gone.

775
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,240
去叫救护车
Get an ambulance. Go.

776
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,630
不是
Not...

777
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,110
员工
staff.

778
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,500
别说话  呼吸  保持呼吸
Don't speak. Just breathe. Breathe!

779
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,440
格鲁伯
Gr... Gruber.
