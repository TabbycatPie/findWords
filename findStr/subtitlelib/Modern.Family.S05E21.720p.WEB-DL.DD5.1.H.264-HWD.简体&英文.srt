没错  亲爱的  米奇尔帮我
Yeah, honey, Mitchell helped me

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,190
挑的衬衫  你会喜欢的
pick up the shirt. You're gonna love it.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,710
我也希望能帮你买唇膏
Oh, I wish I could pick you up some lip gloss

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,410
但我们已经在车里了
but we are already at the car.

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,250
好吧  再见  亲爱的
Okay, bye, honey.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,930
弹得不错吧
Getting pretty good, huh?

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,140
是啊  你一向很厉害
Yeah, but you were always good.

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,940
我很高兴你坚持学下来了
I'm just glad you stuck with it.

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,230
你认真的吗
Seriously?

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,490
怎么了
What?

11
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,100
这琴自己在弹
It's playing itself.

12
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,940
我又不知道
I didn't know.

13
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,700
你真的以为我突然成了钢琴大师吗  爸
You honestly thought that I just became a piano virtuoso, dad?

14
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,050
你看着我从小长到大
You knew my whole life.

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,500
你看过我学琴了吗
Have you ever seen me take a lesson?

16
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,180
我以为你自学了呢
I thought maybe you were self-taught.

17
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,000
抱歉  你说得对
Oh, I'm sorry. You're right.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,090
-就像我自学单簧管一样  -没错
- Like when I taught myself to play the clarinet. - Exactly.

19
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,980
我从没吹过单簧管
I never played the clarinet.

20
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,090
能别说了吗
Can we drop it?

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,910
我们去吃个冰淇淋吧
Let's go get an ice cream.

22
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,160
考虑过我乳糖不耐受吗
What about my lactose intolerance?

23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,860
我不太喜欢这样纠缠下去
Oh, I'm not loving this game.

24
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,370
太糟糕了
This sucks.

25
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,710
我老师给了我单核细胞增多症
My teacher gave me mononucleosis.

26
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,710
[单核细胞增多症: 一种通过接吻传染的疾病]

27
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,930
作为父母  我觉得我有必要问清楚
As a parent, I feel I should ask about this.

28
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,400
别去阻止  她想吸引男人也不容易
Slow down. It's not like she gets that many tugs on the line.

29
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,450
是生物课作业
It's for A.P. Bio.

30
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,920
我们得写关于一种疾病的报告
We have to write a report about a disease,

31
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,990
我拿到了最糟糕的题目  简直开玩笑
and I got the worst one. This is a joke.

32
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,060
其实那种病很严重
Actually, it's pretty serious.

33
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,200
上大学时  我从我室友林那里
Back in college, I caught mono

34
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,560
感染了单细胞增多症
from my roommate, Ling.

35
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,530
是我们鬼混应得的报应
Served us right for fooling around.

36
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,690
不要跟别人同吹一根长笛  孩子们
Never share a flute, kids.

37
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,000
你能载我到图书馆吗
Hey, can you drop me off at the library?

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,630
抱歉  我要去湖边的咖啡馆见朋友
Sorry. I'm meeting some friends at that coffee shop on lake.

39
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,250
你是说图书馆旁边那家吗
You mean the one next to the library?

40
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,240
那是图书馆吗
That's a library?

41
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,050
我还以为那是某个
I thought it was a church

42
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,170
不允许化妆的宗教的教堂呢
for a religion that didn't allow makeup.

43
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,960
洗衣机什么时候才能修好啊
When is the washing machine gonna get fixed?

44
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,190
我裤子底下穿着泳裤呢
I'm wearing a swimsuit underneath my pants.

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,230
大家很快就能穿上干净的衣服了
Everybody's gonna have clean clothes soon.

46
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,530
修理工应该今天早上十点
The repair guy's supposed to come today

47
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,720
到下午两点间过来
between 10:00 and 2:00.

48
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
亲爱的  你能在家里等他吗
Oh! Honey, can you be here for that?

49
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,910
我能坐在空荡荡的房子里等人吗
Can I sit around in an empty house and wait for someone?

50
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,400
亲爱的  我可是房产经纪人
Baby, I'm a realtor.

51
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,620
有执照的  专门干这种事
I have a license for that.

52
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,680
你确定你不介意吗
You sure you don't mind?

53
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,640
去吧  忙你的吧
Go. Run your errands.

54
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,350
这样我正好可以开始洗这些盘子了
It'll give me a chance to get started on these dishes.

55
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,050
很好  走吧  卢克
Oh, good. All right, come on, Luke.

56
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,820
好  晚点见
All right. See you guys later.

57
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,620
盘子比我想象的多啊
Oh. More dishes than I thought.

58
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,790
那个千层面盘子一定很难洗
That lasagna's gonna be a tough one.

59
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,160
有人需要一把硬毛刷了
Somebody's gonna need a scrub brush.

60
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:50,690
你好
Hello?

61
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,790
什么
What?

62
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,280
不...是吧
No...way!

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,620
1988年6月10日
June 10, 1988.

64
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,870
卡拉・康坎农和我在公共泳池里
Carla Concannon and I spent the afternoon

65
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,740
玩了一下午
frolicking at the public pool.

66
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,920
后来在她家里  我们开始做羞羞的事
Later, at her house, things got private

67
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,200
那时还放着卡莉・西蒙的
while a 45 of Carly Simon's

68
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,000
《没人做得更好》的45转黑胶
"Nobody does it better" played.

69
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,520
那是我第一次  也是她第一次...
It was my first time, her first time...

70
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,280
跟我做那事儿
with me.

71
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,980
我一直想要拥有那张45转黑胶唱片
I always thought it'd be fun to own that 45.

72
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,980
当那天早上唱片店终于给我打来电话
When the record store finally called that morning,

73
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,890
我立马跑了过去  以免错过修理工
I ran right down so I wouldn't miss the repairman.

74
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,290
我必须拥有那张唱片
I had to have it.

75
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,890
这是我重温
It was the chance to relive

76
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,090
那神奇的3分42秒的机会
those magical 3 minutes and 42 seconds,

77
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,190
这也正是那首歌的长度
which was also the length of the song.

78
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,790
但我突然间想到
But then it dawned on me --

79
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,710
我心想着那些
I was cheating on my wife

80
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,380
跟别的女人的热烈回忆是对我老婆不忠
with the red-hot memory of another woman.

81
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,460
我不能让克莱尔发现
I could not let Claire find out.

82
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,130
我得销毁证据
I had to destroy the evidence.

83
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,270
还好  我在重压之下依然冷静
Luckily, I'm cool under pressure.

84
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,910
什么  不
What?! No!

85
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,340
他什么时候
When did he...?

86
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,910
不是吧
Come on!

87
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,860
尽管障碍重重
There were a couple of snags,

88
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,210
但我觉得我隐藏得很不错
but I think I covered my tracks pretty well.

很抱歉这么久才把这些衣服拿给你
I'm so sorry it took so long to get you these clothes.

101
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,850
我把它们落在车后座了
I left them in the back of my car

102
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,570
而且完全忘了
and completely forgot about them.

103
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,810
听着好耳熟
Sounds familiar.

104
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,430
我才进药店三分钟
I was in the pharmacy for three minutes.

105
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,060
车窗开了一道缝  还给你留了果汁
You had a cracked window and a juice box.

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,460
别再说那件事了
Let's retire that story.

107
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,380
我能穿这件拍全家福吗
Can I wear this for the family photo?

108
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,930
亲爱的  这件衣服很可爱  但是
Oh, honey, that's adorable, but, you know,

109
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,870
歌洛莉亚要我们穿牛仔裤配黑T恤
Gloria wants us in jeans and a black T-shirt --

110
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,280
经典又随性
Classic and casual.

111
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,660
也许拍完照后  我们可以顺便
And then maybe afterwards, we can stop by

112
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,530
去帮高中话剧表演换布景
and change the scenery in a high-school play.

113
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,380
这条裙子真的很可爱
That is a really cute dress.

114
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,550
是啊  谢谢  昨天刚买的
Oh, yeah, thank you. Just got it yesterday.

115
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,280
真的吗
Really?

116
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,420
让我想起了我六个月前给你的东西
It reminds me of something I gave you six months ago.

117
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,690
你让她穿过二手衣服吗
Do you ever put her in the girls' hand-me-downs?

118
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,520
-有啊  一直都有  -真的吗
- Oh, yeah. All the time. - Really?

119
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,530
因为如果你不喜欢我女儿们的衣服
Because if my girls' old clothes aren't to your taste,

120
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,540
我也可以...给别人啊
I could always just... give them to somebody else!

121
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,960
冷静点  克莱尔
Okay, calm down, Claire.

122
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,560
你的声音高得都快吵到我家的猫了
Your voice is getting to that pitch that disturbs our cat.

123
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,760
我的天呐
Oh, my God.

124
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,820
你们肯定不敢相信老爸说了什么
You will not believe what dad just said.

125
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,090
我们在商场里
So, we're at the mall, right?

126
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,320
那里有架钢琴  我坐在旁边的椅子上
And there's a piano there. I sit down behind it.

127
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,420
-我开始  -拜托  米奇尔
- I start... - Come on, Mitchell.

128
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,510
他就是不太会表扬人
He's just not wired for compliments.

129
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,930
我相信你一定弹得很好
I'm sure your playing was great.

130
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,660
我根本不会弹钢琴  我从来没学过
I don't play the piano. I've never taken a lesson.

131
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,070
-你确定吗  -天呐
- Are you sure? - Oh, my god.

132
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,340
我自己的家人都不了解我
My own family doesn't even know me.

133
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,640
米奇尔  拜托  别这么敏感
Mitchell, please. Don't be so sensitive.

134
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
你看我都没有因为
You don't see me pitching a fit

135
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,070
小卡这么势利不愿接受我们的
because Cam is too much of a snob

136
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,430
二手衣服而生气发火
to use our hand-me-downs.

137
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,540
势  抱歉  势利
Sn-- I'm sorry -- snob?

138
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,660
我告诉你  我来自质朴的农村家庭
I will have you know I come from simple farm folk.

139
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,710
手指甲里永远有在土地里
There is permanent dirt underneath

140
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,840
劳作时留下的泥土
these fingernails from working the soil.

141
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,410
真的吗
Really?

142
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,540
我还不知道给兰花换盆
I had no idea that re-potting your orchids

143
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,120
也算是在土地里劳作呢
counted as "Working the soil."

144
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,550
兰花是种在土里的
Okay, they're in soil, are--

145
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,660
知道吗  我不想讨论这事了
You know what? I don't want to talk about this.

146
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,420
我没必要听这些
I don't need to listen to this.

147
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,740
我要出去透透气
I'm gonna go out and get some air.

148
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,970
我知道那种感觉
I know the feeling.

149
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,980
别再提了  真的
Retire it. Seriously.

150
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,050
你看乔是不是有点脸色苍白
Does Joe look a little pale to you?

151
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,740
这个国家的人在我看来都脸色苍白
This whole country looks pale to me.

152
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,360
今晚就要拍照了 我觉得他脸上应该多点颜色
I think he needs a little color for tonight's photograph.

153
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,570
你觉得使用美黑喷雾的最小年龄是多大
What do you think is the minimum age for a spray tanning?

154
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,880
既然乔出生了
Now that Joe is here

155
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,560
他的头也终于是正常大小了
and that his head is finally normal-shaped,

156
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,510
我决定照一张新的全家福
I decided to take a new family portrait.

157
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,340
好啊
Hola!

158
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:15,020
购物怎么样
How did it go at the mall?

159
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,980
买了一件衬衫  惹怒了我儿子
Bought a shirt, angered my son --

160
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,480
又是一次成功的外出
another successful outing.

161
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,370
我一直想这样做
Ooh. I've been wanting to do this.

162
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,580
快回答  天使头上那个环是什么
Quick -- what's the ring around an angel's head?

163
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,390
-什么  -好啊[光环]
- What? - Halo!

164
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,040
你说了天使那个梗
You did the angel one!

165
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,170
一般情况下我会很高兴
Ordinarily, I'd be delighted,

166
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,140
但这次聊天不会有趣了
but this isn't gonna be one of our fun chats.

167
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,410
你是说像你看见小型飞船时
You mean like that time you called me

168
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,600
给我打电话的那次吗
when you saw that blimp?

169
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,400
它飞得好低  上面的人都冲我挥手了呢
It was so low, they waved back.

170
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,630
我做得很好
I'd done a pretty good job

171
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,530
清除了那张唱片的一切痕迹
eliminating all traces of that record,

172
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,190
但是还有一个问题
but there was still one loose end.

173
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,660
今天早些时候
You know, earlier today,

174
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,380
我们在街上碰见了
when we ran into each other on the street?

175
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,180
我没看见你  你也没看见我
I didn't see you. You didn't see me.

176
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,540
你这是说
Okay, so you're saying

177
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,520
不管我们中的一个在干什么
whatever either one of us might have been doing

178
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,630
这将永远...
will remain forever --

179
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,570
我没看见你  你也没看见我
I didn't see you. You didn't see me.

180
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,350
说清...  喂
Just to be c-- hello?

181
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,830
杰真酷  他明白
Jay's so cool. He gets it.

182
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,090
我不知道他在说些什么
I didn't know what he was talking about,

183
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,430
但我得让他闭嘴
but I needed him to keep his trap shut.

184
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,350
最近  我可能在忙活
You see, lately, I may have been dabbling

185
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,700
像我这样强壮的爷们儿
in something that... strong, virile men like me

186
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,640
不该忙活的事
aren't supposed to be dabbling in.

187
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,830
这不符合我的形象
And it wouldn't exactly fit my image

188
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,290
如果人们发现我打算
if people found out I was considering entering...

189
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,280
带一只可爱的小狗参加狗展
a certain adorable dog in a dog show.

190
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,700
爱心宠物狗

191
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,830
歌洛莉亚觉得我是出去轮换车胎了
Gloria thought I was out getting my tires rotated.

192
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,240
其实  我是在给斯黛拉买装饰领结
Actually, I was buying Stella a decorative show collar --

193
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,730
以防万一嘛
you know, just in case.

194
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,840
我想着如果她看起来很漂亮
I figure if she looks beautiful,

195
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,140
就会更自信
she'll feel beautiful.

196
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,060
猜猜我们在图书馆碰上了谁
Guess who we ran into at the library.

197
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,540
我怎么知道  我一直都在这里
How would I know? I was here the whole time.

198
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,440
桑杰・帕特尔  他拿到了克罗恩氏病
Sanjay Patel. He's got Crohn's disease.

199
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,850
-不是吧  -就是啊  太走运了
- No! - I know. So lucky.

200
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,730
他绝对会获得科学奖学金的
He's totally going to win that science scholarship.

201
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,300
他该用这笔钱来治秃头
He should use it to find a cure for baldness,

202
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,730
因为他都16岁了  还用梳发盖秃头
'cause that kid is 16 with a comb-over.

203
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,190
就这样
That's it!

204
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,590
我得选个新主题
I'm just gonna pick a new topic.

205
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,420
我要一种学校里所有人
I want a disease that everyone in the school

206
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,290
都会讨论的疾病
is going to talk about.

207
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,340
好吧
All right!

208
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,360
你站在这里干什么
Why are you standing there?

209
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,580
因为我好想你  我好爱你
'Cause I missed you. I love you so much.

210
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,220
我也爱你
Oh, wow. Love you, too.

211
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,860
修理工修得怎么样了
How'd it go with the repair guy?

212
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,980
修理工来了  但我错过了他
The repair guy came, but I missed him.

213
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,380
"为什么  你在干什么"
"Why? What were you doing?"

214
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,600
"听唱片"
"Listening to a record."

215
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,330
"什么唱片"  "不重要"
"What record?" "It's not important."

216
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,250
"菲尔"
"Phil!"

217
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,270
"我第一次滚床单时的背景音乐
"The soundtrack to my first sexual experience

218
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,970
我时不时就会想起那个经历
that I think about from time to time.

219
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,820
亲爱的  你要去哪  别带走孩子们"
Honey, where are you going?! Don't take the kids!"

220
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,710
他没来
He didn't show up.

221
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,850
什么  太过分了
What?! That is so annoying!

222
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:33,860
就是啊  放下你的杂物
I know. Put away your groceries.

223
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,770
我打电话给他重新安排
I'll call him and reschedule.

224
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,880
不行  你太善良了
No, no, no, no, no. You are too nice.

225
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,050
我去打电话
I am calling.

226
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,810
不弄清真相我绝不善罢甘休
I am not resting till I get to the bottom of this.

227
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,450
没什么大不了的
It's no big deal.

228
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,360
这又不是我第一次被男人放鸽子了
It's not the first time I've been stood up by some guy.

229
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,070
听听你自己在说什么  菲尔
Oh, listen to your words, Phil.

230
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,090
是啊  是啊
Yep. Yep.

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,680
她说我是势利眼  米奇尔
She called me a snob, Mitchell.

232
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,800
真抱歉  我没有热心地把莉莉
I'm -- oh, I'm sorry if I don't rush

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,240
塞进克莱尔扔给我们的
to throw Lily in every bargain-bin rag

234
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,650
廉价衣服里
Claire tosses our way.

235
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,120
你这样说还是很势利眼啊
You're not really shedding the "Snob" tag with that.

236
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,650
为了今晚的拍照
Look, why don't we just put Lily

237
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,400
不如我们让莉莉穿上艾丽克斯的衬衫吧
in one of Alex's shirts for the picture tonight?

238
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,390
她会看穿的
She'll see right through that.

239
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,640
不  你想的是海莉的衬衫
No, you're thinking of Haley's shirts.

240
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,010
不  我是说我们这样做看起来
No, I mean it'll look ke we're doing it

241
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,690
就像是因为她提到了这事
just because she brought it up.

242
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,530
我知道  所以我在找一张莉莉穿着
Well, I know. That's why I'm looking for a photo

243
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,700
别人的旧衣服的照片给卡莱尔看
of Lily in a hand-me-down to show Claire,

244
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,090
但我好像找不到
but I-I can't seem to find one.

245
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,630
顺便说一句  这些照片里基本都没我
By the way, I'm barely in any of these.

246
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,740
米奇尔  你的建议是我想的那样吗
Mitchell, are you suggesting what I think you're suggesting?

247
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,070
是啊  有时我觉得我们家不关注...
Yes! Sometimes I feel like this family looks right past --

248
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,470
你在建议我们筹划拍一组照片
You're suggesting that we stage a photograph.

249
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,860
给莉莉穿上旧衣服
Put Lily in some hand-me-downs.

250
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,650
让照片看起来像是以前照的
Make it look like it's from the past --

251
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,040
比如说圣诞节  来证明克莱尔错了
Christmas, say -- just to prove Claire wrong.

252
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,750
简单易行
Simplicity itself.

253
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,940
那根本不是我的意思...
That's not remotely what I'm saying --

254
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,320
米奇尔  不要怀疑自己了
Mitchell, don't second-guess yourself.

255
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,320
这简单易行
It's simplicity itself.

256
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,000
是啊  再说一次  我想和主管谈谈
Yes, once again, I would like to speak to a supervisor.

257
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,140
如果我丈夫说没人来  那就是没人来
Listen, if my husband said nobody came, nobody came.

258
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,130
爸爸  该你走了
Dad, it's your move.

259
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,050
不  我想我现在应该保持冷静
No, I think I should just play it cool for now.

260
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,940
对不起
I'm so sorry.

261
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,050
搞定了
Score!

262
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,870
我找到了一个既稀有又有趣的疾病
I got a disease that's rare and fun

263
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,090
嗜睡症
-- narcolepsy.

264
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,890
公司发誓说司机十点来过这里
The company swears that the driver was here at 10:00.

265
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,240
他们在叫司机接我电话
They're putting him through to me right now.

266
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
我要驳倒他的说法
I'm gonna chip away at his story.

267
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,580
看看你怎么脱身吧
Let's see how you get out of this.

268
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
我在思考啊
I'm thinking.

269
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,850
这是一种精神病
It's a neurological condition

270
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,300
病人会在极端压力下睡着
where people under extreme stress actually fall asleep.

271
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,870
就像大脑的一种逃脱方式
It's like a way for the brain to escape.

272
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,930
我打赌他做了什么不该做的事情
I bet he was doing something he shouldn't have.

273
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,710
我就让他一直说到露出破绽为止
I'm just gonna let him keep talking till he makes a mistake.

274
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,440
每个人都会犯错
Everybody makes mistakes.

275
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,590
套索收紧
And the noose tightens.

276
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,580
我的耳机怎么跑到沙发上去了
Why were my headphones in the couch?

277
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,440
很好  你们留有所有司机的定位记录
Oh, good. You do keep GPS logs on all your drivers.

278
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,630
逃不出去了
There's no way out.

279
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,300
我先把你的名字记下来
Let me just write down your name.

280
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,040
谁还需要这张反面唱片店的收据吗
Hey, does anybody need a receipt from Flipside Records?

281
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,380
去他的
Damn it!

282
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,790
我连这个都没看见
I didn't even see that!

283
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,400
我看到你报名了今晚的表演
I see you're registered for tonight's show.

284
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
第一个上场是吧
First one, huh?

285
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,340
是的
Yeah.

286
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,430
大庭广众之下
I'm not sure I'm comfortable

287
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,650
在一个圈里蹦蹦跳跳这种事
with that whole prancing-in-a-circle thing

288
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,550
我觉得不太舒服
in front of everybody.

289
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,500
能找别人带她完成表演吗
Can someone else run her through her routine?

290
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,420
必须是主人亲自带
It has to be the owner.

291
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,820
我想这是最好的  我俩有默契
I suppose that's the best. We have a rapport.

292
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,660
好的  五点见
All right. See you at 5:00.

293
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,230
五点
5:00.

294
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,440
我五点时家里有点儿事情
Uh, I got a family thing at 5:00.

295
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,510
这种活动一般会准时开始吗
Do these things tend to start on time?

296
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,830
当然了  这又不是猫咪表演
Of course. It's not a cat show.

297
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,340
好吧  我最好快去快回  走吧
Well, I better speed it along. Come on.

298
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,400
我真不敢相信妈妈让我带你来这里
I can't believe mom made me take you here.

299
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,250
这是我唯一的一件黑色衬衫
This is my only black shirt,

300
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,930
妈妈让我洗干净
and mom needs me to wash it.

301
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,960
只有当我看到穷人时
It's only when I see the less fortunate

302
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,190
我才意识到我的衣服有多幸运
that I realize how lucky my clothes are.

303
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,340
洗衣机都被占用了  我们只能等着了
All the machines are taken. We're gonna have to wait.

304
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,150
我才不要在这无聊的日光灯下
Oh, I am not spending any more time

305
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,530
浪费更多时间
in fluorescent lighting than I have to.

306
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,580
去把你的衬衫塞到别人的衣服里
You're gonna sneak your shirt in with someone else's load --

307
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,710
比如那个男的  走这边
Like that guy's. Go that way.

308
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,790
我去分散他的注意力
I'll distract him.

309
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,360
不好意思
Excuse me.

310
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:21,930
海莉
Haley?

311
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,380
我的天  凯文
Oh, my god. Kevin.

312
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,460
我的名字是基思
It's "Keith."

313
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,270
你真的不记得
You really don't remember

314
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,100
你在科切拉音乐节上抛弃的男生了吗
the guy you abandoned at Coachella?

315
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,810
我没抛弃你  我给你发信息了
I didn't abandon you. I-I texted you.

316
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,850
那个DJ简直把我催眠了
That deejay put me in a trance.

317
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,810
是嘛  有点儿像是
Yeah. It's -- it's almost

318
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,330
你为了要门票而利用我
like you were using me for tickets.

319
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,960
怎么可能
Oh. That's crazy.

320
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,520
你还能再弄到那个票吗
Can you get those again?

321
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,370
还是你叔叔只能帮那一次忙
Or was that just, like, a one-time thing with your uncle?

322
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,730
只有那一次
It was a one-time thing.

323
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,960
好吧  那么  很高兴见到你
Okay, so, good seeing you.

324
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,930
好吧
Yeah.

325
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,060
-提醒我千万别跟你约会  -想得美
- Remind me never to date you. - You wish.

326
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,630
拜托  我肯定能追到你
Please. I could totally get you.

327
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,220
我倒想看你试试呢
Like to see you try.

328
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,800
好了  莉莉  你能过来吗
All right, Lily, can you come in here, please?

329
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,220
已经到圣诞节了吗
It's Christmas already?

330
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,510
也许应该提前跟她说一声的
Probably should have prepped her.

331
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,070
行了  不  这不是真正的圣诞节
Okay, no, it's not actually Christmas.

332
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,070
我们只要拍一张好玩的照片
We're just gonna take a fun photo.

333
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,050
而且我得在照片里因为我属于这个...
Which I am going to be in because I am a member of the --

334
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,020
我的长筒袜呢
Where is my stocking?

335
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,960
淡定
Oh, relax.

336
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,230
它不在照片里  你也不在
It's not in the shot, and neither are you.

337
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,860
拿着  你在这里拍这张照片
Here -- I want you to take the picture from right over here.

338
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,080
这边  行  很好
This way. Okay, great.

339
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,980
莉莉  你去换上这身衣服
Lily, I want you to put this on

340
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,590
然后站在树前面  我们把照片一次搞定
and then stand in front of the tree, and we'll pop a shot off.

341
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,590
快看这些漂亮的礼物
Ooh! Look at all the pretty presents!

342
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,210
那些都是空盒子
Those are just empty boxes.

343
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,850
你要气死我了
You're killing me!

344
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,730
我不知道是哪一个
I don't know which one it is!

345
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,380
我没看见他放衣服进去
I didn't see him put it in!

346
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,970
等等  我想我找到了
Wait! I think I found it.

347
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,920
他来了
He's coming!

348
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,380
什么  不
What?! No!

349
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,470
你在干什么
What are you doing?

350
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,310
我  我看见你的衣服洗好了
Uh, I-I saw that your laundry was done,

351
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,650
我想帮你叠好  这样我们就能把
and I was gonna fold it for you to make us even

352
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,930
你觉得我做了但其实我没做的事情扯平了
for what you thought that I did that I didn't do.

353
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,910
扯平
Even?

354
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,330
我拿着你的爆米花
I held your popcorn for eight hours

355
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,720
等了你八个小时
waiting for you to come back.

356
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,310
我把整个停车场转了两遍
I walked all the parking areas twice,

357
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,640
查看了所有的医用帐篷
checked every medical tent.

358
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,940
等我回来的时候
By the time I got back to my car,

359
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,420
我的车被砸了  电池被偷走
it had been broken into and the battery was gone.

360
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,650
我不得不用我的音乐节门票
I had to trade my festival pass

361
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,420
换一辆马拖车送我回家
for a ride home in a horse trailer.

362
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,970
可是
But...

363
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,090
看来某人拿到音乐会的纪念衫啦
Looks like someone got a concert t-shirt.

364
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,540
爸爸  有什么事情让你烦心
Dad, is there anything bothering you

365
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,150
导致你  也许是
that might be causing -- I don't know --

366
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,670
严重的心理压力吗
major psychological stress?

367
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,150
没有  我一直表现得很正常  不是吗
No. I've been acting normally, haven't I?

368
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,730
今天早些时候发生什么了吗
Did something happen earlier today?

369
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,440
什么都没有
Uh, nothing at all.

370
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,700
因为你看上去有点儿紧张
Because you seem a little tense.

371
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,280
什么  不  我没有  不要纠缠我
What? No, I don't! Stop badgering me!

372
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,170
我爱你妈妈  我们听音乐吧
I love your mom! Let's listen to some music.

373
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,020
天啊  你有时候编故事的方式
Boy, the way you cook things up sometimes,

374
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,780
有点儿...
it's a little --

375
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,070
-爸  -什么
- Dad! - What?!

376
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,140
你睡着了
You fell asleep!

377
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,440
已经是今天第五次了
It's like the fifth time today.

378
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,730
我觉得这跟没来修洗衣机的
I think it has something to do with that guy

379
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,130
那个人有关
not showing up to fix the washing machine.

380
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,220
事情不完全是这样的
Well, that's not exactly what happened.

381
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,100
你溜出去在反面唱片店
You snuck out to buy

382
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,730
买《没人做得更好》这首歌时
"Nobody Does It Better" from Flipside Records,

383
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,610
他来了是吗
and he showed up?

384
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,170
差不多是这样了
That's more exactly what happened.

385
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,000
你是怎么知道这些的
How do you know all this?

386
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,690
我观察你一整天了
I've been watching you all day.

387
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,190
我觉得由此产生的愧疚感让你昏昏欲睡
I think the guilt from that has been causing you to fall asleep.

388
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,510
那你知道卡拉的事了?
So you know about Carla?

389
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:37,810
现在知道了
I do now.

390
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,900
-爸爸  -到底怎么回事啊
- Dad! - What is happening?!

391
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,730
我原本还对穿牛仔裤和T恤衫表示怀疑
I was skeptical about the jeans and t-shirt,

392
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,820
但我挺喜欢的
but I like it.

393
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,000
摄影师能给我单独照几张吗
Any chance the photographer could fire off a couple solo shots?

394
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,480
看看乔的下半边脸
Look at the bottom of Joe's face.

395
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,250
怎么回事  你把他留在太阳下面了吗
What happened? Did you leave him in the sun?

396
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,910
没有  我带他出去呆了五分钟
No, I took him out for five minutes

397
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,760
好让他脸上有点颜色
to give him a little color.

398
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,100
我肯定忘了把遮阳罩全部放下来了
I must have not closed the visor all the way down.

399
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,120
他的肤色对你来说那么重要吗
Why is it so important to you that he has color?

400
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,070
因为我们要把照片
Because we're sending this picture

401
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,310
寄给哥伦比亚的家人
to our family in Colombia,

402
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,410
但我有个完全不像哥伦比亚人的儿子
and I have a son that doesn't even look Colombian.

403
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,550
到时候他们看到照片
Now they're gonna look at this picture,

404
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,820
肯定会觉得我这个当妈的不称职
and they're gonna think that I am a terrible mother,

405
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,380
居然连自己的小孩都照顾不好
that I can't even take care of my own child.

406
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,020
你的名声早就臭了
I think your reputation is set.

407
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,080
我现在还能做这个动作
I can still do this with my arm

408
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,140
因为我在水池里一直睡到三岁
'cause I slept in the sink till I was 3.

409
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,340
你好
Ha-lo!

410
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,920
人已经来了  我来照顾乔
People are here. I'll deal with Joe.

411
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,260
-好吧  -来吧  小宝贝
- Okay. - Come on, buddy.

412
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,760
起来咯
Ohh. Come on.

413
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,750
好啊  克莱尔还在路上
Hola. Claire is on her way.

414
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,690
爸  你得向妈妈坦白
Dad, you have to confess to mom.

415
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,710
消除愧疚感是唯一能解救你的办法
Clearing your conscience is the only way to make this stop.

416
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,620
真的吗
Really?

417
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,170
希望如此  不然我就得重写论文结论了
I hope so, or else I have to rewrite the whole end of my paper.

418
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,990
怎么只有你们俩  其他人呢
Just the two of you? Where's the rest?

419
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,590
我还想着五点前把照片的事解决掉呢
I had hoped to get this picture thing wrapped up by 5:00!

420
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,640
他们会各自过来
They're all coming separately.

421
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,290
小卡  帮个忙  打电话催一下米奇尔
Cam, do me a favor -- call Mitchell and light a fire under him.

422
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,380
我就在这儿呢  爸
I'm right here, dad.

423
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,350
好吧  我没看到你进来
Oh. Good. I didn't see you come in.

424
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,810
是你帮我开的门
You opened the door for me.

425
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,650
你还感谢我带了瓶雪当利酒过来
You thanked me for bringing a bottle of Chardonnay.

426
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,910
听起来不像我
Doesn't sound like me.

427
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,860
各位  我们到了
Hey, guys. We're here.

428
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,190
终于来了  快开始吧
Finally. Let's do this.

429
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,320
卢克你的黑T恤呢
Luke, where's your black shirt?

430
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
就在这儿  我去换上
Right here. I'll get changed.

431
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,950
好吧  快一点
All right. Shake a leg.

432
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,260
-你好  亲爱的  -你好
- Hey, sweetie. - Hi!

433
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,020
莉莉  小心点
Hey, Lily, be careful.

434
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,460
别弄脏了这么漂亮的衣服
Don't get anything on that beautiful outfit.

435
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,730
看到没有  是不是很眼熟
Recognize it? Look familiar?

436
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,390
我看到了  但我不觉得
Yes, I do, but I hardly think

437
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,320
你们在我发完火之后再给她穿
that putting her in one of Alex's hand-me-downs

438
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,060
艾丽克斯的旧衣服能证明什么
proves anything after I pitched a fit.

439
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,830
首先  我认为你敢于承认
Well, first of all, I think it's really healthy

440
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,000
自己发了火真的很不错
that you do admit it was a fit.

441
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,080
但如果你还需要别的证明
But if you need further proof,

442
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,160
我肯定还能找到照片
I'm sure I could find a photograph over here.

443
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,380
没问题  找吧
Sure. Go ahead.

444
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,310
没我
No me.

445
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,250
没我
No me.

446
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,230
没我
No me.

447
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,590
找到了  去年圣诞节早上
Ah. There we are.Christmas morning last year.

448
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,480
天啊
Oh, my god.

449
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,420
是艾丽克斯的旧睡衣
Oh, it's Alex's old pajamas!

450
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,540
对不起  我该向你道歉
I'm so sorry. I owe you an apology.

451
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,210
有些时候我可能太
Sometimes I can be really --

452
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,760
那是什么
What's that?

453
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,410
挂历是十二月
Uh, the calendar opened to december,

454
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,260
给圣诞老人的饼干被吃了一半
the half-eaten cookies for Santa Claus,

455
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,670
给驯鹿的胡萝卜被啃过  哪里有问题
the nibbled-on carrots for reindeer? I don't know.

456
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:45,240
那不是上个月的《名利场》杂志吗
No, that looks like last month's Vanity Fair.

457
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,470
好莱坞的造型不就那么几种
Oh, well, you know, every month's "Young hollywood."

458
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,830
莉莉那颗牙不是刚掉的吗
Mm, and didn't Lily just lose that tooth?

459
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,190
不  牙还在  就是弄脏了
Nope, it's still there. It's just dirty.

460
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,190
圣诞节早晨吃的巧克力
Christmas-morning chocolates.

461
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,740
我很确定这个是米奇尔
Uh, and I am quite sure that's a reflection of Mitchell

462
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,060
穿着今早那套衣服的身影
in the clothes he was wearing this morning.

463
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,970
我终于出现在照片里了
Oh, yay, I finally made it into a picture.

464
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,390
你真是本性难移啊  是吧
Just couldn't change, could you?

465
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,260
你是个势利眼
You are a snob.

466
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,190
-你知道吗  -你是个势利眼
- Okay, you know what... - You're a snob.

467
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,690
就算不是势利眼也看得出
...it hardly takes a snob to recognize

468
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,170
-你给你的孩子们买的衣服  -势利眼
- the clothes you put your children in... - Snob!

469
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,940
顶多也就称得上普通
are uninspired at best.

470
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,650
-克莱尔  小卡  够了  -真的吗
- Claire,Cam, enough! - Oh, really?!

471
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,350
这家里每个人的品味都很棒
Everybody in this family has good taste.

472
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,370
只不过各不相同
It's just different.

473
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,320
这已经引发了太多争执
It's causing too many fights.

474
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,270
所以我今天才要求
That's why today I just put everybody

475
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,840
大家都穿简单的T恤和牛仔裤
in a simple T-shirt-and-jeans outfit.

476
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,740
现在开始定一条新家规
Mm. There's a new rule from now on --

477
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,970
谁也不能再给别人的小孩衣服
nobody gives clothes to anyone else's children.

478
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,090
我觉得这是最好的解决方案
Well, I think that's probably for the best.

479
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,400
感谢上帝乔这次生日我不用
Thank god I don't have to spend one more of Joe's birthdays

480
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,670
再那样尴尬地笑了
with a funny smile on my face.

481
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,940
谢谢你小卡  他很喜欢
Thank you, Cam. He loves it.

482
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,450
双胞胎哟
Twinsies!

483
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,540
好了  各位  要照相了
Okay, everybody, it's picture time.

484
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,690
卢克呢
Where's Luke?

485
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,630
在这儿呢
Right here.

486
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,230
宝贝  你穿的是什么  女生的T恤吗
Honey, what are you wearing? Is that a girl's shirt?

487
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,220
我貌似在洗衣房拿错了
I guess I grabbed the wrong one from the laundromat.

488
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,610
不过坦白讲我不讨厌这种贴身感
If I'm being honest, I don't hate the way it fits.

489
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,420
肯定是那家伙的女友的衣服
It must be that guy's girlfriend's shirt.

490
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,680
要是我说这样让对他更有兴趣了
Is it bad that that makes him

491
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,810
是不是不太好
more interesting to me?

492
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,860
是的  离他远点
Yes. Stay away.

493
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,750
不用担心卢克  我们可以让他站到后排
Don't worry about Luke. We'll stick him in the back row.

494
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,070
不是所有人都能被拍得好看的
Not everyone can look their best in the picture.

495
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,400
乔准备好了
Joe's ready.

496
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,060
你对他做了什么
What did you do to him?

497
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,710
你想让他看起来更像哥伦比亚人
You want him to look more Colombian.

498
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,910
没有比哥伦比亚国旗更合适的了
What's more Colombian than the Colombian flag?

499
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,810
太完美了
He's perfect.

500
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:09,010
今天对我的儿子们来说不是个好日子
Not a banner day for my male heirs.

501
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,750
克莱尔  你站到后面去
Claire, you're in the back.

502
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,620
菲尔  你站克莱尔后面  别乱比手势
Phil, you're behind Claire. No rabbit ears.

503
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,870
我不希望你在克莱尔背后玩什么花样
I don't want you messing around behind Claire's back.

504
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,110
卡梅隆  莉莉  快来
Cameron, Lily, come on in.

505
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,050
要照相了
It's picture time.

506
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,080
亲爱的
Honey.

507
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,940
我有点事想跟你说
There's something I need to tell you.

508
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,990
你知道人都会有一些
Uh, you know how you can treasure

509
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,280
想要珍惜的过去
special moments in your past

510
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,030
但绝不会因此影响现在的幸福
that in no way diminish the special moments in your present?

511
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,730
没错  亲爱的  那叫做回忆
Yeah, sweetheart, it's called having a memory.

512
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,000
希望我坦白的时候你态度能好一点
Okay, I wouldn't mind a friendlier tone as I move through this.

513
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,910
你做了什么
What did you do?

514
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,540
快  快  快
Up, up, up, up, ah!

515
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,620
走错方向了  宝贝
No, that's the wrong way, sweetheart.

516
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,460
莉莉的口袋里掉了什么出来
What fell out of Lily's pocket?

517
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,230
那是钻戒吗
Is that a diamond ring?

518
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,900
跟你的T恤肯定很配
Huh. That'll go great with your shirt.

519
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,180
看上去是真的
It looks real.

520
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,070
是真的
It is real.

521
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:47,460
有点小瑕疵但是颜色很正
A small occlusion, but very good color.

522
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,390
是克莱尔的
This is Claire's.

523
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,300
不是
No.

524
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,240
克莱尔的戴在她手上呢
Claire's got her's on.

525
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,510
菲尔  得了吧  你完全无法区分
Ay, Phil, please, you cannot tell the difference

526
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,140
这颗美丽但有点小的钻石
between this beautiful, but a small, diamond

527
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,780
和那一大块的玻璃仿制品
and that chunk of glass

528
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,610
那玩意儿几周前就该把她的手指勒断了
that should have made her finger fall off weeks ago.

529
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,210
我感觉我好像给你惹祸上身了
I feel like I am getting you in trouble.

530
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,260
拍照啦
Picture time!

531
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,320
怎么回事
What's happening?

532
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,230
好吧  你先别生气
Okay, don't be mad.

533
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,220
我几个月前把我的真戒指弄丢了
Um, I lost my real ring a few months ago,

534
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,680
我刚刚才意识到那肯定是掉进了
and I just realized it must have fallen

535
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,690
我送给莉莉的那一箱衣服里
in the box of clothes I gave to Lily.

536
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,980
你为什么要把戒指取下来
Why'd you take it off?

537
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,380
我开车被警察拦下了
Well, I got pulled over,

538
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,080
我想跟他调调情  让他免开罚单
and I wanted to flirt my way out of the ticket

539
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,810
于是假装我是单身
by pretending I was single

540
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,440
那方法起作用了  我还挺喜欢的
And it worked, and I kind of liked it.

541
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,120
然后我对这种喜欢产生了深深的愧疚感
And then I felt so guilty about liking it

542
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,650
于是我想把这全部的记忆都抹除掉
that I just wanted to erase the whole thing.

543
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,770
所以你撒谎了吗
So you lied?

544
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,750
是的  我撒谎了  我很抱歉
Yes. I lied. I'm sorry.

545
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,570
那是不是说明我是个很糟糕的人
Does that make me a terrible person?

546
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,670
不  不会  你在开玩笑吗
No, no. Are you kidding me?

547
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,470
我们已经结婚很久了
We've been married for a long time.

548
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,790
我们各自都有点小秘密也是很自然的嘛
Of course we're gonna have our little secrets.

549
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,170
重要的是
The important thing...

550
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,440
我们心里很清楚
...is that we know the difference

551
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,410
无害的放纵
between a harmless indulgence...

552
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,140
和真正放荡的区别
and a real indiscreet--

553
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,190
歌洛莉亚
Gloria?

554
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,340
-左边那枚  -谢谢
- Left. - Thank you.

555
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,920
好了  该拍照了
Okay, it's picture time!

556
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,210
大家都快点
Everybody, hury up.

557
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,500
赶快就位
Get in your positions.

558
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,660
都好了吗
All right?

559
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,960
很好  大家应该都到齐了
All right, I think that everyone is here.

560
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,260
准备好了吗
Okay, ready?

561
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,680
笑一个
And smile!

562
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,120
开什么玩笑啊
Are you kidding me?

563
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,730
没有一个人注意到我不在
Nobody noticed I wasn't here.

564
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,700
你们是怎么回事啊
What does it take with you people?!

565
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,240
乔  我的宝贝  你还好吧
Ay, Joe, my baby, are you okay?

566
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,470
好吧  好吧  或许只有那样
Yeah, yeah, maybe -- maybe that -- that's what it takes

567
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,660
你们才会注意到我
for you to pay attention to me --

568
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,320
像乔一样发一下脾气
Throw a temper tantrum like -- like Joe.

569
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,430
我也可以大发  雷霆
I could just throw a big...temper tantrum that --

570
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,790
把一切都弄得一团糟
Or if I make a mess of everything and...

571
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:34,370
我觉得你刚刚的火是冲着我发的
I feel like that was aimed at me.

572
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,460
你想谈谈这事吗
You want to talk about it?

573
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,100
不如我去弹弹钢琴消消火吧
Or I could just play some piano.

574
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,390
看来被我猜中了
So I'm in the ballpark.

575
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,880
听着
Look.

576
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,800
如果你有时候觉得我们没注意到你的存在
If it seems sometimes like we don't notice you,

577
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,580
那或许是因为我们正集中心思
maybe that is because we are focused...

578
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:51,020
处理我们各自愚蠢的问题
...on our own stupid problems,

579
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,910
你这人向来很稳重
And you're so steady.

580
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,860
你是说我很无趣吧
Oh, you mean boring.

581
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,020
-不是的  -就是的
- No. - Yeah.

582
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
冷静
Calm.

583
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,430
因为你是按照你想要的方式
Because you live your life

584
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,810
在过自己的生活
the way you want to.

585
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,960
实际上  你最近也激励了我
In fact, you inspired me recently.

586
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,980
怎么说
Oh, how so?

587
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,040
好吧
Fine.

588
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,810
我最近经历了一些事
I've been going through this thing lately.

589
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,350
一切都开始于我注意到
It all started when I noticed

590
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,470
有一群男人喜欢聚在公园的角落里
a group of guys in the corner in the park.

591
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:18,160
老实说  我最开始知晓他们在做什么时
And, uh, honestly, when I first found out what they were doing,

592
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,180
我觉得那很怪
I thought it was kind of weird,

593
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,280
但后来我发现我不停想着这事
but I found I kept thinking about it.

594
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,280
我觉得我该去尝试一下
And I thought I'd give it a whirl.

595
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,550
好吧  继续
Ok-- okay. Go on.

596
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,260
我觉得你应该能猜到接下来会怎样
I think you know where I'm going with this,

597
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,720
但是其中一个比我年长的家伙领我进了圈
but one of the older guys showed me the ropes.

598
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,010
不知不觉地
Next thing I know,

599
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,110
我每天都会去那个公园的那个角落
I'm hanging out at that park in that corner every day

600
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,260
并且很喜欢那种感觉
and loving it.

601
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,740
但我一定对此感到有些羞耻
But I must have also got some shame about it

602
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,840
因为我在做那事儿的时候
because it feels good

603
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:41,170
真的感觉很爽  但是
when I'm doing it, but...

604
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,270
那还是我吗
Is that me now?

605
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,290
带狗表演的男人
A guy with a show dog.

606
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,280
原来是这个啊
There it is!

607
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,610
好吧  我知道你不是去公园搞基
Okay, see, I-I knew what it wasn't.

608
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,130
我就是不知道你到底在干什么事儿
I just wasn't sure what it was.

609
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,440
实际上  现在就有一场表演
In fact, there's a show right now,

610
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,560
但是  我不去了
But...ah, I'm not gonna go.

611
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,830
不  不  爸
No, no. D--

612
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,030
-我可以看出来这事对你很重要  -不
- I could tell this is important to you. - No.

613
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,390
你该去  你该去
You -- you should go. You should go.

614
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,130
我不想偷溜出去
I don't want to sneak out,

615
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,200
我也不想其他人知道这事儿
and I don't want people to know about it.

616
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,210
爸
Dad.

617
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,330
一个睿智的人曾经跟我说过
A wise man once told me,

618
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,830
"我不理解这个
"I don't get it,

619
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,360
但如果那就是真实的你
but if that's who you are,

620
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,830
千万别为此觉得羞耻"
Don't you dare be ashamed of it."

621
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,730
我当时对待那事的态度真是很好
I did handle that kind of well.

622
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,310
是呀  是啦  好吧
Yeah, yeah, well...

623
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,690
那对我来说可不易
And it wasn't easy.

624
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,480
我从没想过我儿子会成为一名律师
I just never pictured my kid a lawyer.

625
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,340
让人们见到真实的你是很可怕的一件事
It's scary to let people see the real you,

626
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,770
即使是面对你最亲的家人亦是如此
even when those people are your own family.

627
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,740
但其实我们最不该担心他们的态度
But aren't they the ones we should be least worried about,

628
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,460
因为他们是不带偏见爱我们的人
the ones who will love us without judging,

629
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,380
他们会原谅我们的过错
who forgive our faults

630
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,180
庆祝我们的不完美
and celebrate our imperfections?

631
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,530
甚至会鼓励我们
Maybe even encourage us

632
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,450
尽情展现真实的自己
to let our true selves shine through?

633
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,040
等等  稍等一下
Wait, wait. Hang on. Wait, wait.

634
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,820
好了
Okay.

635
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,050
我觉得你看上去好漂亮
I think you look beautiful.

636
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,040
我看上去好老
I look old.

637
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,100
我所有的表亲都会看到的
All my cousins are going to see this.

638
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,770
点击一下那个按钮  把我的皱纹都修掉
Click the button that makes my wrinkles go away.

639
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,450
-出什么事了  -没什么
- What happened? - Nothing.

640
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,710
才不是没事呢  你都成跛子了
It's not nothing. You're limping!

641
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,890
你是不是又尝试跳俄式舞蹈来着
Were you trying to do the Russian dance again?

642
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,360
就是我在尝试的很愚蠢的举动
It was just something stupid I was trying out,

643
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,020
我也不知道为什么这样
and I don't even know why,

644
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,660
那几乎是不可能的
since it's basically impossible.

645
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,880
歌洛莉亚  歌洛莉亚  快看
Gloria. Gloria! Check it out.

646
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,840
这一定是你见过的最萌的事吧
Is this not the cutest thing you've ever seen?

647
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,810
它第一次尝试就成功了
She did that on her first try.

648
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,230
他也好喜欢
He loves it, too.

649
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,550
算你狠  乔  继续戳我痛处吧
Oh, oh, sure. Rub it in, Joe.

650
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,800
真棒
Attagirl!

651
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,140
它往我这边来了
Here she comes this way!

652
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,770
现在它就有点儿炫耀的意思了
Now she is just showing off.

653
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:26,890
我也是的
Both way.
