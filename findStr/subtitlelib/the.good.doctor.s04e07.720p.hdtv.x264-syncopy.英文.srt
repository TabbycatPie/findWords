18
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,840
We can't both shower at the same time, Lea.

19
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,630
One of us would block the steam of water for the other.

20
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,140
Oh, Shaun, this is not for the purpose of cleanliness.

21
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,850
This is for the purpose of having sex with you.

22
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,850
N-no. No.

23
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,440
It would be inconvenient, possibly dangerous.

24
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,690
Soap might get into difficult places.

25
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,360
If we leaned against the shower handle,

26
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
we could scald ourselves.

27
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,070
Bottles could be disarranged.

28
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,700
It was just a thought.

29
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,580
It was a bad thought.

30
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,580
I'm surprised.

31
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,200
You're such an intelligent person.

32
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,710
I'll...reset your alarm.

33
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,880
It's a three-day weekend and a full moon.

34
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,550
People are gonna do stupid things.

35
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,470
I'm asking everyone to take an extra trauma call in the E.R.

36
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,550
Make yourselves available if you're needed.

37
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:07,550
Questions?

38
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,140
How'd you get the bruise?

39
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,720
First casualty of the full moon.

40
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,180
I smacked my head on a cupboard door

41
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,730
when I was reaching for my coffee mug.

42
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,900
Any other questions?

43
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,610
Why is there a Subaru in your parking space?

44
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,440
Because it's my car.

45
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,570
You have a car?

46
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,490
You're gonna be seeing a lot of it.

47
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,650
I sold the Ducati.

48
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,570
What? No.

49
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,740
It just wasn't practical.

50
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,160
Is it already gone? Because --

51
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,080
A guy from Craigslist snatched it up.

52
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,620
Any other questions -- not dealing with the bike?

53
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,670
It wasn't that much of a bruise.

54
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,790
But the doctor at the ski resort told us

55
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,550
I might develop a hematoma?

56
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,800
It's not unusual, but it'll need to be drained.

57
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,510
I see you were treated for melanoma six years ago,

58
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,720
and, more recently, breast cancer.

59
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,180
Hence the ski trip.

60
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,520
A celebration.

61
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,390
One year cancer-free. Also five years cancer-free.

62
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,900
I don't suppose a long needle will be involved in this?

63
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,150
Your hematoma extends pretty deep,

64
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,950
so the needle will have to be long.

65
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,200
But it's over quickly.

66
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,570
Sorry, I have to intervene before this deal goes south.

67
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,030
You don't mind if I step out?

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,500
Would you like us to wait for your husband to come back?

69
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,080
No.

70
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,710
Let's go ahead.

71
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,630
How do you get frostbite in San Jose?

72
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,920
Cryotherapy accident.

73
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,720
I stayed in the booth a little too long.

74
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,930
I was going to stand outside for the full three minutes,

75
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,390
- but he said -- - I said, "No need."

76
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,390
I'd set the stopwatch on my phone --

77
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,230
after which, my thoughts immediately drifted, and...

78
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,690
I came back to find him frozen in carbonite.

79
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,360
You know, I'm more worried about the fever.

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,320
Was the cryotherapy meant to treat something?

81
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,400
No. Routine self-care.

82
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,690
We've made life extension part of our health regime --

83
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,570
supplements, meditation, exercise.

84
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,410
Three of my gaming apps have gone viral.

85
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,370
I'm lucky enough to afford basically whatever I want,

86
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,870
so I spend it on my health.

87
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,420
No, I figure fever, must be an infection.

88
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,840
Well, I know that frostbite can make you vulnerable.

89
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,460
It just -- It didn't seem severe enough to...

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,140
Oh, sorry. I feel a little queasy.

91
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,050
Wyatt.

92
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,900
I need a medical transport team, stat.

93
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,860
Perforated bowel. He needs immediate surgery.

96
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,200
No. No. Why do people hate wind farms?

97
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,750
Everyone thinks they're noisy.

98
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,870
This could make a turbine sound as quiet

99
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,420
as a page turning in a library.

100
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,880
That's not worth our investing in?

101
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,380
Did you even look -- Hold on.

102
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,340
Anything I need to know?

103
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,470
Hematoma's drained.

104
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,340
We're sending a sample to Pathology -- routine.

105
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,800
Should have it back sometime tomorrow.

106
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,760
Thank you.

107
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,970
I couldn't help overhearing a little.

108
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,140
Are you a venture capitalist?

109
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,650
The only people who ask me if I'm a VC

110
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,400
are people who want a VC to invest in their project.

111
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,240
Maybe, after we get your wife healthy again, we could talk?

112
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Call whenever you're ready.

113
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,950
My life is listening to ideas.

114
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,530
If it's good, I'll run it by my two partners.

115
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,370
If it's really good,

116
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,700
we'll take a 30% equity position in your company.

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,790
Yeah.

118
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,960
Yeah, you're the one who wanted us to get into clean technology.

119
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,010
I think I've been asked out on a date.

121
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,090
Nice.

122
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,010
No, I work with him.

123
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,010
- Hasn't stopped you before. - I supervise him.

124
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,140
Schedules can be changed.

125
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,640
He's polyamorous.

126
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,100
Unless he also texted you a ring, it's just a date.

127
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,520
And you need to get out more.

128
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,060
So do I.

129
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,700
You want to take down the splenocolic ligament.

130
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,120
Just don't nick the inferior mesenteric artery.

131
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,750
I feel the I.M.A. under my finger.

132
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,790
Placing the stapler.

133
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,620
And cutting.

134
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,210
I voted "approve."

135
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,010
Disapprove.

136
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,720
No opinion.

137
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,380
There's a poll?

138
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,720
Yes -- about shower sex.

139
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,810
I know it's wrong to discuss shower sex at work,

140
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,310
so I did a poll instead.

141
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,520
Much better.

142
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,270
Dr. Murphy, do you really want people knowing the details

143
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,520
of your personal life?

144
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,940
You don't think they took it as an abstract question?

145
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,980
No. We all take it as something that happened

146
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,860
between you and Lea.

147
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,030
And that there was a fight.

148
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,660
Sometime before 8:00 A.M. today,

149
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,870
which was when the poll was sent out.

150
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,870
You are very astute.

151
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,330
I'm seeing diffuse dilation of the large bowel here.

152
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:45,330
Is that normal?

153
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,590
Some calcified lesions.

154
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,460
Wall's thin, too.

155
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,630
Hirschsprung's.

156
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,630
I thought Hirschsprung's was a disease only babies

157
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,800
and young children got.

158
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,680
It is.

159
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
But he has it.

160
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,770
We treated the Hirschsprung's

161
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,110
by removing the dilated part of your colon.

162
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,820
It won't impact your life,

163
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,650
but we would like an explanation.

164
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,820
Dr. Murphy doesn't mean

165
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,610
we expect you to be a diagnostician.

166
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,610
It's just...

167
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,490
this was kind of singular.

168
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,200
So, if you have any thoughts...

169
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,460
Did anyone in your family suddenly develop these symptoms?

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,630
I did something singular to myself about six months ago.

171
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,010
I modified my genetic code.

172
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,340
I did a CRISPR procedure under the guidance of some researchers

173
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,720
I know in China through my work.

174
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,510
They put together a series of cocktails.

175
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,730
They FedExed them to be, and Sophie helped me inject them

176
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,230
into my bone marrow.

177
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,060
Why?

178
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,980
If you know anything about CRISPR,

179
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,110
you know how risky it is to tinker with your genome.

180
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,860
You have no idea what problems you might let loose.

181
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,450
I needed to optimize my telomerase activity.

182
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,110
It's the enzyme responsible for correcting

183
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,990
cell replication errors --

184
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,370
essentially, the cause of aging.

185
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,530
You can't stop aging

186
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,700
through changing your telomerase activity.

187
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,830
You might extend your life a little,

188
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,920
but exercise -- it does the same thing.

189
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,000
Much less risky.

190
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,380
Your decision makes no sense.

191
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,090
Extending my life by a few years is only my short-term goal.

192
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,090
Look, you know how fast medicine is moving.

193
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,930
The day isn't that far away when cloning

194
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,140
will make transplants as easy as switching out a light socket.

195
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,850
AI will start to make breakthroughs

196
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,520
that we can't predict or understand.

197
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,600
Medical knowledge will rise exponentially.

198
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,310
There are babies born now who could live to see it,

199
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,360
could live to be 1,000 years old.

200
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,030
Maybe more. Maybe forever.

201
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,240
Or at least, as long as they want to.

202
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,030
So, our plan is to give my CRISPR a year

203
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,160
to make sure the telomerase change works,

204
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,200
and then we'll do her.

205
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,290
We'll aspirate a sample of your bone marrow.

206
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,080
See if we can figure out what the hell you did.

207
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,680
I don't think coffee's a good idea.

208
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,390
Entire civilizations rely on it.

209
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,270
But I don't think you're referring to the beverage itself.

210
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,140
I don't think it's a good idea for first-years

211
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,480
and fourth-years to go out.

212
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,520
I am bound to supervise you at some point in the future,

213
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,780
and it'd get complicated trying to change dates out,

214
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,900
and the fact is...

215
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,740
seeing somebody you work with rarely ends happily.

216
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,620
So, I appreciate you thinking of me, but I --

217
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh, you thought it was a date.

218
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,790
I'm still new here, and I thought it was

219
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,040
a good opportunity to get to know each other.

220
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,170
Coffee's perfect because you're asking

221
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,460
the least amount of commitment from another human being.

222
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,170
It's not even lunch.

223
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,630
If it's still a "no," it's still a "no,"

224
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,840
but I'll let you re-think your answer.

227
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,490
He only claimed it wasn't a date to save face.

228
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,570
Or maybe I just assumed.

229
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,530
But why did I assume?

230
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,530
I don't think I'm some kind of narcissist

231
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,950
who thinks every man wants to get close to me.

232
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,790
Or we both assumed it's a date because it's a date.

233
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,380
This is fun. I like being your bestie.

234
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,590
Slumber party?

235
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,720
I made a poll to test the popularity of shower sex.

236
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,930
I heard.

237
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,100
I fielded some questions about that.

238
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,640
"Approve" has won, but don't get too excited, Lea.

239
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,980
It's only 58-38,

240
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,440
with several complicated noncommittals,

241
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,900
so clearly my attitude is reasonable.

242
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,820
We don't have room for a...

243
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,450
skier exercise thing.

244
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,410
I'm only putting it together so I can take a picture

245
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,660
and sell it online.

246
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,830
Why do you have it if you don't want it?

247
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,090
My ex sent it.

248
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,460
"Ex"?

249
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,840
Husband.

250
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,180
I left this thing in the attic

251
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,560
until I got settled somewhere with enough space.

252
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,390
And okay, that was 10 years ago,

253
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,180
but it's not like it was in his way.

254
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,070
We got married, not for long, right out of high school.

255
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,740
Literally the boy next door.

256
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,820
We grew up together. People expected it.

257
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,950
It...was a big mistake.

258
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,200
We both realized it pretty quickly.

259
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,830
Why would you even want to live forever?

260
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,670
You'd be bored out of your mind.

261
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,710
The person I am now

262
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,550
is miles away from the person I was at 14.

263
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,470
I only get more distant every year.

264
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,930
You learn to understand,

265
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,980
love books that you once hated,

266
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,730
sometimes people you once hated.

267
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,990
Music that you didn't get the point of becomes magical.

268
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,780
And a thousand new doors will open.

269
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,570
I look forward to the adventure.

270
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,160
Sorry. Adventure's not always gonna be fun.

271
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,370
I figure it takes 40 or 50 years

272
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,710
just to get over the things your parents did.

273
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,630
If only we lived long enough,

274
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,260
the human race might finally have a chance to grow up.

275
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,100
What size shoes do you wear?

276
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,850
7 1/2.

277
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,270
"Dr. Allen's Walking On Clouds Inserts."

278
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,730
Putting "doctor" in the name is always good marketing strategy.

279
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,320
They're designed to reduce inflammation

280
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,400
that could lead to plantar fasciitis,

281
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,950
calluses, arthritis, and they feel damn good.

282
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,030
Does this have anything to do

283
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,490
with our patient's venture capitalist husband?

284
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,910
I need testimonials.

285
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,500
Labs and Path for Hannah Palmer.

286
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,090
Aren't we all busy enough learning how to be surgeons?

287
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,210
Do you really want to divide your focus onto something trivial?

288
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,390
Because wanting to make money taints the purity of medicine?

289
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,850
I have five brothers.

290
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,270
I've been taking care of people my whole life.

291
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,480
Someone got hurt, they came to me to patch them up.

292
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,940
I became a doctor so I could get paid for it,

293
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,450
but also because I'm good at taking care of people.

294
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,740
It's possible to do something for more than one reason.

295
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,540
The news is bad.

296
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,140
There's an abnormally healthy population

297
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,930
of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells.

298
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,100
He did it?

299
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,440
It's significant.

300
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,560
He's succeeded in optimizing enough telomerase activity

301
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,150
to potentially add 10 years to his natural life.

302
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,650
Well, assuming it doesn't subtract about 50.

303
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,280
There's already an autoimmune reaction

304
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,530
that mimics Hirschsprung's.

305
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,660
Who knows what else he did?

306
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,240
What if this is the opposite of an auto-immune condition?

307
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,410
What if he's done something

308
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,370
that lowers his resistance to infection?

309
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,790
Then we'd be seeing more opportunistic infections

310
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,170
of the lungs and skin.

311
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,040
If you lived another 1,000 years,

312
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,380
would you be with the same person at the end

313
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,590
as at the beginning?

314
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,670
- No. - No.

315
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,680
No, if you assume monogamy.

316
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
I mean, that puts too much strain on a relationship.

317
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,720
Is one person supposed to be everything to another,

318
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,310
all the time, for 1,000 years?

319
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,270
Apparently Jesus agrees. On monogamy.

320
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,650
He said that, in Heaven, there'll be no more marriages.

321
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,070
I guess humans can't sustain a relationship that long.

322
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,480
You read the New Testament, too?

323
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,950
And the Qur'an. And other things.

324
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,320
It's like you're a stalker.

325
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,280
It's like you and God had an acrimonious divorce.

326
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,200
What if he caused neurofibromatosis?

327
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,830
Microscopic tumors forming on the nerve sheath?

328
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,250
Mm. Possible, but there'd have been

329
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,920
some evidence of Schwann cell growth around his colon.

330
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,250
Would you still love your wife in 1,000 years?

331
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,720
You have three answers. That should be enough.

332
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,050
Park's marriage failed in far less time,

333
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,600
and Enrique doesn't even try.

334
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,760
Asher is an...

335
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,680
unknown quantity.

336
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,850
You're committed.

337
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,690
You've made promises.

338
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,190
I've made promises based on

339
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,860
an understood human life-span, Murphy.

340
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,070
Most likely diagnosis is autoimmune polyneuropathy.

341
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,740
It damaged the enteral ganglion nerve

342
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,160
and led to the perforations.

343
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,410
Start him on steroids and immunosuppressants.

344
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,250
Dr. Andrews.

345
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,210
So, you wouldn't have gotten married

346
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,040
if you thought it would be forever.

347
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,750
You expect all relationships to fail over time.

348
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,500
It's just a question of how long?

349
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,970
I love her now.

350
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,010
I intend to love her as long as I live.

351
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,600
But, eventually, everything breaks.

352
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,030
I always go back to comfort reading when I'm in the hospital.

353
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,070
Cozy mysteries in little English villages,

354
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,240
where nothing bad happens to anyone we like.

355
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,830
We've gotten your results back.

356
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,290
When will your husband be --

357
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,370
Is it cancer?

358
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,710
Yes.

359
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,710
Thyroid carcinoma.

360
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,630
We're gonna do a complete imaging series

361
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,840
to pinpoint just how advanced --

362
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,590
Treatment?

363
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,140
Surgery to remove some or all of your thyroid

364
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,310
is usually the first line of defense.

365
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,100
Sometimes, we can wait, but given the hematoma

366
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,020
was probably caused by the tumor invading nearby vasculatures,

367
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,270
we should probably do it in the next few days.

368
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,400
Later, there'll be radioactive iodine treatment...

369
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,490
Panic attack?

370
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,160
Her trachea's deviated to the right.

371
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,500
The tumor's compressing it. We're doing surgery now.

372
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,470
What happened? The nurse just said "surgery."

373
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,550
Was it the hematoma?

374
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,430
It's more serious.

375
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,890
I-It's not cancer...

376
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,480
again.

377
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,860
Thyroid carcinoma.

378
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,900
We've removed her thyroid. She's doing well.

379
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,030
We're looking into potential causes --

380
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,660
genetic, environmental.

381
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,870
There may be a deeper issue that we can find and address.

382
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,210
I can't do this.

383
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,090
You've done it before.

384
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,970
You'll do it this time.

385
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,140
Do you know what it's like...

386
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,190
to wake up every morning and know your wife

387
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,690
might not be here next year?

388
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,190
All those treatments...

389
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,450
they all -- they all have this little tag attached to them

390
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,330
that says, "Because she might die."

391
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,080
And you see them put those gloves on

392
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,670
before they hook up the chemo.

393
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,830
You know why they do that.

394
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,960
It's because it's poison.

395
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,920
And you sit there...

396
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,510
and you watch them shove poison into the person you love.

397
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,220
And why?

398
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,270
Because she might die.

399
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,610
We're killing her because she might die.

400
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,450
Go for a run.

401
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,530
Go punch a wall.

402
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,160
You need to release some endorphins.

403
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,620
My release is my job.

404
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,500
That's why I love it.

405
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,750
My work requires total focus.

406
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,790
And every minute I'm working

407
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,000
is a minute I'm not thinking about...

408
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,840
losing her.

409
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:27,840
I have to go.

410
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,100
Your pain and weakness are consistent with polyneuropathy,

411
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,770
treatable with steroids and immunosuppressants.

412
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,730
If you live 1,000 years, will you still love Sophie?

413
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,320
Yes.

414
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,410
How can you be sure?

415
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,910
People change. You expect to change.

416
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,160
Sophie and I will change together.

417
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,660
We'll go through the same adventures

418
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,790
and learn the same lessons.

419
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,120
What if you go through the same adventures

420
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,750
and learn different lessons?

421
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,050
Even if we did, whoever, whatever we become,

422
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,670
Sophie will always be beautiful.

423
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,300
I mean, she could turn into a machine or a set of pixels

424
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,300
or a giant purple flower, and she'll still be beautiful,

425
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,220
because it's part of her essential nature.

426
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,150
But if you don't know how you'll change,

427
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,940
you don't know how you'll change.

428
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,860
Shaun.

429
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,780
We'll let you get some rest.

430
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,700
The steroids should make you feel a lot better.

431
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,160
Why didn't you ever mention you had an ex-husband?

432
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,090
Shaun, I've barely thought about him in years.

433
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,630
I didn't mention him because he's not important.

434
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,720
I know. That's the problem.

435
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:50,930
At one time,

436
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,970
you felt he was important enough to your life to marry him,

437
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,520
and now you barely think of him.

438
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,730
You make long-term plans, you have expectations,

439
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,400
and then something happens to you,

440
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,730
and suddenly you're a different person.

441
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,160
I know you don't like change,

442
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,990
but it's not all bad.

443
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,780
After all, you are working to change yourself all the time.

444
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,410
I'm working to be a better surgeon,

445
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,540
a better boyfriend,

446
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,000
better at the things I've chosen,

447
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,790
but this...

448
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,170
other change -- it's unpredictable.

449
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,170
You don't choose it.

450
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,840
It just comes at you.

451
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,220
Oh, it's like hurricanes before 1873,

452
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
when the Army Signal Corps first put up flags

453
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,850
to warn people storms were coming.

454
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,480
Before that, houses were flattened, lives destroyed,

455
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,020
and there was no way to see it was heading for you.

456
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:43,940
Shaun.

457
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,530
Our relationship will not end in natural disaster.

458
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,320
It did begin in one.

459
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,280
I'm going to look in on my patient.

460
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,530
Okay.

461
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,070
Blood and saliva will tell us if there's a genetic cause,

462
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,070
and the samples we take from your house

463
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,290
will tell us if there's something environmental.

464
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,570
I know it's s-stupid.

465
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,110
I've almost felt guilty for my cancer,

466
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,730
like I arbitrarily decided to be sick and burdensome.

467
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,530
Do the people you're close to

468
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,350
ever act like you're a burden to them?

469
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,590
You mean Alan.

470
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,170
He's scared.

471
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,790
He takes the exit he's got and he turns to his work.

472
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,380
You're okay with that?

473
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,890
I accept this compromise.

474
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,240
That's not the hard part. The hard part is...

475
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,460
not knowing.

476
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,820
Each new thing that happens, I worry,

477
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,440
"Is this it?

478
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,470
Is this where I lose him?

479
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,510
Is this where he breaks?"

480
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,000
So, this is boiled coffee.

481
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,300
Some people call it "Turkish coffee,"

482
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,260
or "Greek coffee," or "Egyptian coffee" --

483
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,660
because we need to take ownership

484
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,210
and put things in categories.

485
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,020
Yeah.

486
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,560
You actually live in this thing,

487
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,800
in the hospital parking garage?

488
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,670
Why not?

489
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,260
Convenient for work.

490
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,670
When I want to spend a few days off the beaten track,

491
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,240
it's convenient for that, too.

492
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,490
I'm gonna get three sips in this.

493
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,860
But three really great sips.

494
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,050
That's how I try to live my life --

495
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,630
try to appreciate, savor, not pass by.

496
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,430
Is that what the polyamory is about?

497
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,740
Does it really work, or is it one of those theories about life

498
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,430
that people regret later?

499
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,070
No regrets so far.

500
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,290
No, I guess not.

501
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,900
Not while you're young and having fun.

502
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:09,920
It is fun,

503
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,730
but not for the reasons that you're thinking.

504
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,300
It isn't about sex.

505
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,060
It's about commitment, emotional connection.

506
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,320
The joy I'm sure you get out of a relationship,

507
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,430
I get a little more.

508
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,310
Also, I have to give a little more.

509
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,950
But that's meaningful, too.

510
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,220
Do you mind if I ask you something,

511
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,340
since we're getting personal?

512
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,250
Sure.

513
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,250
What's your favorite misheard song lyric?

514
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,570
This is nice.

515
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,060
I'm glad it's not a date.

516
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,400
Me, too.

517
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,870
I don't believe in those categories.

518
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,960
He reported widespread bilateral pain,

519
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,020
then he keeled over.

520
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,230
B.P. dropped to 80 over palp.

521
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,310
I'll order a vasopressor.

522
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,680
- Already did.  - Good.

523
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,800
We need an EKG, CBC, and chest images,

524
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,880
and a new diagnosis.

525
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,570
Whatever he caused with CRISPR, it's not just neuropathy.

526
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,650
Something else is killing him.

527
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,310
What if he's caused something that mimics

528
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,540
carcinomatous autonomic neuropathy?

529
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,030
It explains the B.P. and bowel issue.

530
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,160
That doesn't explain the sensory issue that led to the frostbite.

531
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,030
A connective tissue disorder?

532
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,420
That would have shown up on the scans.

533
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,910
His chest looks normal.

534
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,610
Maybe we can't think of the answer because there is no answer.

535
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,700
We keep trying to jam it into

536
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,990
these categories we know, the diseases that we know.

537
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,570
But this never existed before.

538
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,500
He created a new combination of genetic code.

539
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,500
That means a new combination of symptoms.

540
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,490
So, we shouldn't be looking at what fits the picture,

541
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,300
but at what's closest to the picture,

542
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,180
so we can at least figure out a treatment.

543
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,480
And what it's closest to is amyloidosis.

544
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,740
This isn't an autoimmune neuropathy,

545
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,130
so the nerves must be under attack by something else.

546
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,090
Something like amyloid disease

547
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:16,020
could leave deposits along the nerves,

548
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,850
causing the symptoms we've seen.

549
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,880
Where do we look for those deposits?

550
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,610
The spleen.

551
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,840
Drink all 8 ounces.

552
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,830
We talked. We had a few laughs.

553
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,020
Well, sounds date-y to me.

554
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,160
I don't think Enrique's a player.

555
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,810
No, he's kind of the opposite of a player.

556
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,390
With him, emotional connection is the point.

557
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,460
He's trying to live some idealistic fantasy

558
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,490
where everyone is nice and no one is jealous.

559
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,950
I am so staying away.

560
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,070
Well, of course.

561
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,400
Once I heard "emotional connection,"

562
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,710
I knew the game was over.

563
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,460
What does that mean?

564
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,140
I'm against emotion?

565
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,420
I'm not the one with "cold-hearted bitch"

566
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,160
as my social media hashtag.

567
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,310
She's an excellent doctor.

568
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,730
Every time you've loved somebody,

569
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,760
it's ended in disappointment or death

570
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,820
sometimes both.

571
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,340
It's like a reflex now.

572
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,330
You just expect that everything ends badly, so why start?

573
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,990
So, despite the many practical reasons

574
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,280
not to go out with a first-year,

575
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,760
this is all about me?

576
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,600
Is that a diamond ring?

577
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,530
I mean, it's pretty.

578
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,330
Our patient caught her fiancé cheating.

579
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,330
Big fight. He demanded the ring back.

580
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,860
She swallowed it.

581
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,740
I did.

582
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,280
You don't even know if this is "going out,"

583
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,550
and that's the point.

584
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,430
It doesn't matter what Enrique's offering.

585
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,980
Whether it's friendship or romance, you're not investing.

586
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,190
You're risk-averse.

587
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,090
Your portfolio right now

588
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,240
is entirely in T-Bills and money market.

589
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,450
I have no idea what that means.

590
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,390
And it's too bad, because a guy that can make you laugh

591
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,330
might be just what you need right now.

592
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,660
It's progressed to your large intestine.

593
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,110
Here's a plastic bag. Put it over the toilet seat.

594
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,690
You'll have every opportunity to recover your property.

595
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,970
Don't run away from a chance at love.

596
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,770
It's a date...

597
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:01,020
maybe. I don't know.

599
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:05,710
Her house is full of T.C.E. --

600
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,950
a side effect from chip-making

601
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,820
back in Silicon Valley's early days.

602
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,480
So, they move away from their toxic home,

603
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,290
and hopefully things get a little better.

604
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,420
Probably not much.

605
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,550
She also has a genetic predisposition.

606
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,760
It's both?

607
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,430
She shouldn't go outside in a rainstorm.

608
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,400
How do you tell a woman that her third cancer

609
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,560
likely won't be close to her last?

610
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,090
Unfortunately, this is a teaching moment.

611
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,250
Dr. Allen, after 12 hours on duty,

612
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,110
I can report that your inserts came through.

613
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,270
Check your e-mail. You'll find my testimonial.

614
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,650
- Claire.  - Olivia.

615
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,680
And if you're right, what will you do?

616
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,890
We'll treat the symptoms with targeted drug therapies.

617
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,770
There really isn't a disease, as such, that we can address.

618
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,160
The pain shifted?

619
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,900
Yeah.

620
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,860
Never mind about the ultrasound.

621
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,970
It'll be easier to check for deposits

622
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,400
after the organ's been removed.

623
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,480
- After it's……  - Yeah.

624
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:16,760
His spleen's about to rupture. Call a transport team.

625
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,120
It's called Li-Fraumeni Syndrome -- LFS.

626
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,450
An inherited predisposition

627
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,970
to developing a wide range of cancers.

628
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,100
Yes, there was a toxin in your environment

629
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,780
that likely played a role in this,

630
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,480
but there will be other triggers in the future.

631
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,650
Your body is super sensitive

632
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,090
and will respond with tumors for the rest of your life.

633
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,290
I know that's a shock,

634
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,040
but here's what you should know,

635
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:02,580
most cancers are treatable if found early enough.

636
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,830
We know the most common associated with LFS,

637
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,020
and we can do surveillance,

638
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:14,010
nip anything in the bud before it becomes a problem.

639
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,640
It may not seem this way now, but this is good.

640
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,940
We know what we're dealing with.

641
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,210
We're warned, and we'll be ready.

642
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,000
He won't be able to handle this.

643
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:42,680
Liver, pancreas, other organs look normal.

644
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,450
But there are calcified lesions along these nerves.

645
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,420
He's gonna be in pain like this for the rest of his life.

646
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,100
No.

647
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,790
There's a reasonable chance it'll get worse

648
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,140
as time goes on.

649
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,300
I need my sharp-blunt curved scissors.

650
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,580
What if we use CRISPR to reverse CRISPR?

651
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,070
Researchers have identified a protein in certain bacteria

652
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,390
that inhibits CRISPR.

653
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,300
What if we insert the DNA that makes that protein

654
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,590
into our patient's genome?

655
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,260
That would deactivate the CRISPR gene.

656
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,200
So, CRISPR messed him up permanently,

657
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,730
and you think we should do more of it?

658
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,580
I don't know. Our patient is a risk-taker.

659
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,280
We'd need a delivery mechanism.

660
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,520
The code would have to be introduced through a virus,

661
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,650
a virus that specifically targets nerves.

662
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,980
Polio targets nerves.

663
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,000
Because this isn't risky enough.

664
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,900
Polio is such a dangerous virus

665
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,550
because it's so good at penetrating the nervous system.

669
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,870
Dr. Murphy?

670
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,780
She's going to be this way...forever.

671
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,130
She'll have good periods and bad periods.

672
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,760
But she will always have to be on her guard.

673
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,180
Is she always gonna have to be on guard against you, too?

674
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,310
What does that mean?

675
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,810
Chronic illness puts strain on relationships.

676
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,590
Statistically, it is more often the man who can't handle it.

677
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,660
Our marriage is none of your business.

678
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,350
Her health is my business.

679
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,700
And your behavior adds to her stress.

680
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,610
You look at her, and you imagine she's gone,

681
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,370
and that is hard. I get it.

682
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,190
She thinks the same thing when she looks at you.

683
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,660
I never complain to her. I know it's nobody's fault.

684
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,620
You don't think she knows you have trouble with all this?

685
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,260
Every time something new happens,

686
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,170
she wonders, is this the straw

687
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,120
that is gonna break your marriage?

688
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,040
You've got her living in a constant state of uncertainty.

689
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,590
That is practically the definition of stress.

690
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,920
So, this is the "straighten up and fly right" lecture.

691
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,070
No.

692
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,740
I am...

693
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:13,820
I'm telling you to consider how best to time your divorce.

694
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,210
There are gonna be a lot of new issues dropping on Hannah,

695
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,800
and if you're gonna end up leaving anyway,

696
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,110
you should start planning now.

697
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,780
- I don't want to leave my wife. - My best advice?

698
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,610
Help her through this next round of treatment as best you can,

699
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,660
and then get out.

700
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,200
It's hard living with someone who needs so much.

701
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,650
I know you feel there is a point where you have nothing left,

702
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,360
where you're ready to break.

703
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:47,860
Just...don't break when she needs you most.

704
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,490
Get out before that happens.

705
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,960
Reading an article that's five years old?

706
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,110
Dr. Glassman was once involved in an experimental attempt

707
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,990
to treat Parkinson's with CRISPR technology.

708
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:22,520
- It failed. - So, it's both old and it didn't work?

709
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,260
Dr. Glassman likes his failures to be informative.

710
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,470
That's why his articles are longer.

711
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,000
Do you worry about losing the people you love?

712
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,510
Because we can't stop ourselves from changing,

713
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,930
which means we might stop loving someone,

714
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,260
or they might stop loving us.

715
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,070
It is a very bad thing.

716
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,330
It is.

717
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:53,890
So, no one can ever feel...safe.

718
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,810
How can you keep going if you never feel safe?

719
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,820
Well, sometimes, not changing is just as dangerous.

720
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,230
So, how do you know when to do what?

721
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,550
If you find the answer to that, let me know.

722
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,470
- I have it. - You do?

723
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:27,250
Dr. Glassman used varicella zoster virus

724
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,210
as the delivery mechanism, which didn't work.

725
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,240
His first choice was herpes simplex,

726
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,720
but the technology was not up

727
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,060
to putting their DNA package into it.

728
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,130
The technology has improved.

729
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,420
It can be done.

730
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,300
Using conventional treatments,

731
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,030
there's nothing more we can do for you.

732
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,130
The pain will be permanent, and it could get worse.

733
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,010
Well, I've not been one to be limited by the conventional.

734
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,160
We think we can reverse the CRISPR.

735
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,170
You want to reverse what I did? My telomerase change?

736
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,910
They want to stop your pain.

737
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,670
Soph, it's temporary.

738
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,940
What is it, 40 years?

739
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,220
That's nothing. Our real lives are ahead of us.

740
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,470
Hey, look, as long as this doesn't kill me,

741
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,690
I've made the right choice, no matter how bad things get.

742
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,740
No.

743
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,170
I was willing to exercise for hours and fast,

744
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,700
to give up all sugar and alcohol

745
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,340
and do all the other things that we needed to do

746
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,890
to get to a future that I knew might never come.

747
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,970
But now, you're asking me to watch you suffer

748
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,520
for the rest of your life.

749
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,480
You're the one who embraces change.

750
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,130
So, change to the person who can be happy with me...

751
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,670
here and now.

752
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,100
Doctors, would you mind waiting outside?

753
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,790
Why did she want us to leave?

754
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,080
I think she's delivering an ultimatum.

Understood.

815
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,540
But life is about change,

816
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,150
which means, one day, you might change your mind.

817
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,510
And if you did, I'd be open to that, too.

818
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,450
It's not gonna happen.

819
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,200
Okay.

823
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,290
First, there should be no soap involved.

824
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:10,070
Also, we need to stay at one end of the shower,

825
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,150
so we don't accidentally knock into the temperature control.

826
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,940
What changed your mind?

827
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,240
I've been thinking about change over time.

828
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,090
I spoke with people and also graphed

829
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,740
several possibilities for us,

830
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,560
using time as the horizontal axis

831
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,830
and change as the vertical.

832
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,930
I realized that the problem isn't really change.

833
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,820
It's whether two people change in the same direction.

834
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,340
We want to keep our coordinates close to each other

835
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,130
for the rest of our lives.

836
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,420
We certainly do.

837
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,060
- But people sometimes do drift apart. - Yes.

838
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,780
You need a warning when you and your partner

839
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,240
might be starting to veer off,

840
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,910
so you can both change course a little.

841
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,170
You don't want a surprise realization when it's too late.

842
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,600
Surprises are awful.

843
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,690
The U.S. Army Signal Corps used flags to warn of hurricanes.

844
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,260
I brought us this.

845
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,780
A cowbell?

846
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,800
If you see us heading in different directions,

847
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,980
you ring it.

848
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,050
Do we really need a bell? Can't I just tell you?

849
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,110
When you ring it, I'll pay attention.

850
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,710
I really hate the sound.

851
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,080
Only in emergencies.

852
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,330
I've already moved the shampoo bottles.

853
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,600
