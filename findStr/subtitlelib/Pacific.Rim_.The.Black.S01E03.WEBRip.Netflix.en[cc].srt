-[Hayley] Mmm.

Come on. Wake up.
Something's happening out there.

Uh…

11
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,720
What's going on?

12
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,431
People, in vehicles.
If we hurry, we can get to them.

13
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,682
Wait, people?

14
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,394
And you wanna… I mean, we don't…
we don't know anything about them.

15
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,022
We don't know anything about anybody
because, surprise,

00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,066
we hid from the world for five years.

17
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,113
You really wanna risk it?

18
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,074
We won't make contact
if they look all sketchy, I promise.

19
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,160
Hey there.

20
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,579
-Uh, you wanna go on a little walk?
-No, no, no.

21
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,624

34
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,763
Hayley,
I'm not calling him George or Barnaby

35
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,642
or Chad or whatever little brother name
you've loved since you were four.

36
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,936

-Nope.

[Taylor] Look. Those people.

42
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,248
Their truck is PPDC. Weapons too.

43
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,250

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,126

Uh, he doesn't really talk.

He's just curious.

-That'll get you killed in the Black.
-The Black. Yeah, good point.

107

So, what's with him?

108
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,331
He was part of our community.

Camouflage is enough to keep Kaiju away?

117
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,799
Not always.

118
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,468
Sometimes we have to pack up and roll out.

-Two.

120

Unintentionally.

00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,031
They're no threat.

125
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,284
Hop out. It's okay.

Welcome to Bogan.

00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,139
Keep up.

133
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,312
What's their story?

134
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,441
-They say they walked here.
-Find out what they're hiding.

135
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,442
Always do.

00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,612
Until then, my trade
with Ferno's team is now jacked

since I promised them four eggs.

138
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,742

and thank us.

You want some Riders to go meet 'em?

No Ferno this time, eh?
Just his bootlicker.

153
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,437
Good enough, I guess.
But I don't see the big-ticket items.

Not bad?

157

They're fully charged.
And they don't come cheap.

Power cells are rare in the Black.

Oh.

160
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,998
Years of energy when tapped.
And worth a lot in trade.

161

Like, how much?

162
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,003
Why? In the market?

163
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:57,133
No, no, of course not.
I mean, what would we do with one?

164
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,676
You tell me.

165
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:03,639
Demarcus, looks like
you didn't screw this up too badly.

166
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,892
In there.

167
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,030
Doesn't look like four to me.

169

What's Ferno even want with those things?
You can't eat 'em.

170

I once had a guy
crack one open and suck out the yolk.

His whole jaw dissolved away.
Now he looks ridiculous.

172

Mr. Ferno trades them to the Sisters.

173
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,635
[laughs] Those lunatics in the hills?
Why am I not surprised?

174
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,930
I'm serious.
They don't respond well when disappointed.

175
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,766
I need four.

176
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,018
The Kaiju we get them from is dead.

177
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,522
Now these two are worth more.
Want 'em or not?

Grab the case.

181
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:10,331
Look, half the eggs, half the cells.

182
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,291
I'm gonna need both.

183
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,334
[guns cock]

184
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,423
What is with you guys and your guns?

185
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:27,348
[guns cocking]

186
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,100
-[cocks gun]
-Huh?

187
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,687
-Let's get out of here.
-Not without a power cell.

188
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,606
Taylor, please.

189
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,152
All right. I'll come back for it later.

190
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,368
[gasps]

191
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,079
Not leaving, are ya?

192
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,372
Because that would be rude

193
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,041
after we've opened our arms
to you and all.

194
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,336
We were invited here,
and now we're ready to go.

195
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,713
Sorry to shatter the illusion,

196
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,591
but Mei didn't invite you children here.

197
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,094
-[cocks gun]
-She <i>brought </i>you here.

198
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,138
-[groans]
-[gun fires]

199
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,266
[man shouts]

200
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,273
Ah!

201
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,025
-[engine sputtering]
-Ugh! Come on.

202
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,945
[gunfire stops]

203
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,036
[panting]

204
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,996
Huh?

205
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,748
Demarcus, it didn't have to go this way.

206
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,417
[gunshot]

207
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,378
So, what now?

208
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,504
You live.

209
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,174
Because I want you to tell Ferno
that if he retaliates,

210
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,302
I'll feed him to the Kaiju.

211
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,142
No!

212
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,435
[eggs splatter]

213
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,107
-What the hell are you doing?
-Letting the Sisters sort this out.

214
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:03,193
Make sure our friend here gets back home.

215
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,321
Give my best to Ferno.

216
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,160
[engine starts]

217
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,663
[engine sputtering]

218
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,915
Get out.

219
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,002
[gasps]

220
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,171
If Ferno survives,

221
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,757
he'll be out for blood,
thanks to you and your friends.

222
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,259
[grunts, panting]

223
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,305
[Mei] The eldest boy
seems to want a power cell.

224
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,057
I… I don't know why yet.

225
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,518
[grunts]

226
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,812
Bring them to me.

227
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,612
[slow tapping]

228
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,586
[Shane] How far west?

229
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,923
-Far.
-[Shane] The mountains?

230
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,549
[Taylor] Maybe.

231
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,431
A 14-year-old girl and an idiot boy
walked with you from the mountains?

232
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,141
[sighs] Yes.

233
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,270
-Just tell me where your vehicle is.
-[indistinct screams]

234
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,273
[grunts] Don't have one.
What are those voices I keep hearing?

235
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,858
Never mind them.

236
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,568
How did you get to Meridian City?

237
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,363
[grunts] One step at a time.

238
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,615
[chuckles]

239
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,826
You think you're pretty clever.

240
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,457
Look, if your brother
tells him the truth, he'll be…

241
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,584
he'll live.

242
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,753
[Shane] Tell me about your parents.

243
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,255
Where are they?

244
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,798
Are they alive?

245
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,051
And how have you survived
in the Black this long?

246
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,469
Where have you been living?

247
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,431
[Taylor grunts]

248
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:58,726
[loud thud]

249
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,894
[Shane] <i>Mei's got a gun</i>
<i>to your sister's head.</i>

250
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,479
<i>Wanna see her again? Talk.</i>

251
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,523
<i>-You never lived in Meridian.</i>
-[indistinct screams]

252
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,358
<i>The place is crawling with Rippers.</i>

253
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,944
<i>Tell me where your community was.</i>

254
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,405
<i>How many years there?</i>

255
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,658
<i>Who was in charge?</i>

256
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,660
<i>Why did you leave?</i>

257
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,455
<i>Anyone looking for ya?</i>

258
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,082
<i>Don't even think about lying to me.</i>

259
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,169
<i>Where are your parents?</i>

260
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,881
<i>Why did they leave you?</i>

261
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,925
<i>Did they just walk away?</i>

262
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:37,222
<i>How have you made it without weapons?</i>
<i>Have you come across any mecha wreckage?</i>

263
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,349
<i>Tell me about…</i>

264
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:42,519
[intense music playing]

265
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
[glass shattering]

266
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,874
[roars]

267

[inaudible]

269
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,896
[Shane]<i> How many Kaiju</i>
<i>have you encountered?</i>

270
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,856
<i>How do you expect to stay alive?</i>

271
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,692
<i>And how will you protect</i>
<i>your sister and the boy?</i>

272
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,946
-Do you even have a plan?
-Stop! Stop!

273
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,906
[panting] No more questions.

274
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,074
I'm done.

275
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,372
You can go.
Thank you for your cooperation.

276
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,089

-Ah.

278
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,637
Well done, Mei.

279
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,181
We got ourselves a Jaeger.
