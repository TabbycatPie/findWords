Hey, how did you know

349
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:08,779
That she was breaking
into the bank?

350
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,749
- I got an alert on my phone.

351
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:13,751
There's a little ring-a-ding
[imitates ring]

00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,019
Every time, like,
there's a robbery at a bank.

00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,687
- What?
- But you know what?

354
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,422
I think I can get
the s.T.A.R. Labs satellite

355
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,858
To scan for any irregular
solar radiation emissions

356
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,095
And we can find
doctor light's light.

357
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:28,432
- Okay, I'm gonna also call joe,
see if ccpd has any leads.

358
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,402
Why don't we keep them apart
until I get back?

359
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,005

that won't be a problem.

00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,052
- How's your science stuff?

365
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,086
- I finished it.

366
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,688
Um, did you get
your report done?

367
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,123
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,693
It wasn't as much fun
writing it by myself, but...

369

I'll see ya.

370
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,796

is the thing that gets lost?

00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,890

um, tomorrow?

almost the same mistake I did

With the particle accelerator.

400
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,537
- He did a lot
of terrible things,

401
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,773
And none of them
were by mistake.

402
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:18,843
- What did he do to you?

403
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:20,278
I know he caused
the singularity,

You can barely

Why is that?
What did he do to you?

408
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,155
- He shoved his hand
through my chest.

409
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,290
He stopped my heart.

Ouch, okay, that would do it,

But you survived that.

413
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,034
- Only because barry
erased that timeline.

414
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:45,503

Barry traveled in time.

415
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,807
- Twice.
- Hmm.

Here's how it is.
- What's the deal?

417
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,678
- You don't have to like me.

418
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,279
I don't like you,

419
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:58,716
But you have to work with me
to stop zoom and doctor light.

420
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:01,485
Can you do that?

421
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,753

won't we?

422
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,689

You said
you were going to re-task

00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,727
The s.T.A.R. Labs satellite?

426
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,163

yeah, we're up and running.

your program.

I want to see if it works.

It'll work.

Harry's starting
to get on my nerves.

- Could be a trap.

doctor light is not a killer.

because he knew you'd hesitate.

what's he talking about?

Maybe I didn't always
confront him when I should have.

Truth is, zoom scared me.

sat down with wells,

- Mm.
Life-changing, to be honest.

00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,147
- All right,
how do I do that?

867
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:27,050
- By running so fast,
you create multiple afterimages

868
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,586
Of yourself,
you create a speed mirage.

869
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:32,989
- A wha--speed mir--
I've never run that fast.

870
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,290
- Well, from what
I've been told,

871
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,825
You've traveled through time.

872
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:37,760
You'll be more than fast enough.

873
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:39,529
- Okay.

874
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,509
[grunts]

875
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,982
- Barry?
<i>- I can't do it.</i>

876
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,384
- Yes, you can, barry.
Hey, dr. Wells is right.

877
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,319
You are fast,
faster than I ever was

878
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,054
And better than I ever will be.

879
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,323
Don't let fear and doubt
hold you back like it did to me.

880
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,858
<i>You're the flash, barry.</i>

881
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,927
Show light what that means.

882
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,495
- [exhales]

883
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:24,274
- Where are you?

884
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,342
[grunts]

885
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,648
- I'm right here.

886
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,388
- Doctor light is safely locked
in the pipeline.

887
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,356
- Nicely done.

888
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,226
- Wells, thank you
for helping barry

889
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,427
Put away doctor light.

890
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,095
- So what now?

891
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,198
- [exhales]
we do what dr. Wells said.

892
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,302
We use her to lure zoom here,
end this once and for all.

893
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:53,736
- You can't be serious.

894
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,104
- More breachers are gonna come.

895
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,639
More innocent people may die.

896
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:58,775
I can't let this happen anymore.

897
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,343
- You're making a mistake.

898
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:03,846
Okay, zoom is a nightmare
you can't wake up from.

899
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,249
- I've already had
my worst nightmare.

900
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:07,650
His name was reverse flash,

901
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:10,587
And I spent a long time
being afraid of him.

902
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:13,022
I'm not gonna
be afraid anymore.

903
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,258
- Okay, barry.

904
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,060
You may be faster than me,

905
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,529
But you're not ready
to fight zoom by yourself.

906
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,364
- That's just it, jay.

907
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,066
I'm not gonna fight him
by myself.

908
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,767
I've got all of them
to help me.

909
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:27,770
I've got dr. Wells.

910
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,706
I've got you.

911
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:34,210
- No, I can't in good conscience
help you when I know

912
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:36,913
It'll only lead
to you losing your speed,

913
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,781
Or even worse,

914
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,650
Your death.

915
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,586
- Optimism must be
an earth-1 thing.

916
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:47,323
- You all need to ask yourself
why this man, for years,

917
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:49,359
Wouldn't admit
that he was responsible

918
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,995
For the particle accelerator
exploding underground.

919
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:55,298
He may not be harrison wells
from your earth,

920
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,501
But he has just as many secrets
as the one you knew.

921
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,539
- Jay, please don't go.

922
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,710
- I'm so sorry, caitlin.

923
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,820
- Have a nice day.

924
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,455
What can I get...You?

925
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,557
- Yeah, I know,
this is supes awkward,

926
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,159
Probably more for me
than for you,

927
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:25,228
But I just want coffee, okay?

928
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,964
Just three flashes,
one of them decaf.

929
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,599
That's it.

930
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:36,272
- Are you sure
that's all you want?

931
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,507
- Oh, that's funny.

932
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,008
You just want to shoot me down
again, huh?

933
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,411
- No, no, no, no.

934
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:45,682
What I mean is,
I just moved to central city,

935
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:49,185
And it's a pretty big change
from where I come from.

936
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,953
Everything here is
so big and new

937
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,256
And filled with meta-humans.

938
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:56,392
- Yeah, well, when you factor in
the size of the city,

939
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,995
The chances of running
into a meta-human are

940
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,196
Actually pretty low.

941
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:01,531
- [giggles]

942
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,266
I guess what
I'm trying to say is,

943
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,669
You kinda caught me off guard
the other day,

944
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:08,705
But now
I'm a little more prepared,

945
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:13,509
So I just want to make sure,
is coffee all you want?

946
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,749
- Hi, I'm cisco ramon.

947
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,718
- Kendra saunders.

948
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,553
It's nice to meet you.

949
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,854
- Are you okay?

950
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,556
- Yeah, I just--

951
00:40:26,558 --> 00:40:29,225
I was getting used to jay
being part of the team.

952
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,661
- Well, look,
jay is a hero.

953
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:35,531
They always seem to show up
just when you need 'em.

954
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,101
- Yo, peep that.

955
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,469
- Wow!

956
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:40,970
- That's how it's done,
young padawan.

957
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,271
- Nice.
- Going on a date next week.

958
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,073
- Things are looking up
for cisco ramon.

959
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,241
- I guess so.

960
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,642
Still stuck
with these powers, though.

961
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,611
Just don't know
how to feel about 'em.

962
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,213
- Hey, look,

963
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:52,181
You don't gotta go
through it alone.

964
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:54,884
- And now you need a cool name.

965
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:58,287
- Oh, snap!
You're totally right.

966
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,189
[sighs]
I gotta think about this one.

967
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,557
Well, you know me.
It's gotta be perfect.

968
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,025
- Mm-hmm.
- Something that really sings,

969
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,560
You know?

970
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,596
Something like--

971
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,531
- Vibe?

972
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:11,534
- Vibe.

973
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:13,870
