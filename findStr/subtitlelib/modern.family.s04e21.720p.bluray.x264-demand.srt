1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,510
-我什么都没说  -别说话了
- I didn't say anything. - Stop talking.

2
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,700
你这也是在说话
That's talking.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:07,800
你觉得她睡着了吗
You think she's asleep yet?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,950
我和你一样都在门外啊
I'm on the same side of the door as you are.

5
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:10,530
-别说话了  -小卡
- Stop talking. - Cam.

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,420
莉莉今天掉了第一颗牙
Lily lost her first tooth today.

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,350
她现在非常期待牙仙子的到访
And she's very excited about the visit from the tooth fairy.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,510
我第一次有牙齿松动时
When I have my first loose tooth,

9
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,780
我妈将绳子一端系在那颗牙上
my mom tied one end of the string to it,

10
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,900
另一端系在奶牛的尾巴上
the other to the tail of a cow

11
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,660
用12号猎枪开了一枪
fired off a 12-gauge shotgun,

12
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,450
奶牛跑出了房间
and the cow went running out of the room.

13
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,270
本故事纯属虚构
That never happened.

14
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,300
你去看看我卧室里的奶牛型墙洞再说
Tell that to the cow-shaped hole in my bedroom wall.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,300
抓住了
Gotcha!

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,450
你们跑我房里来干嘛
what are you doing here?

17
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,260
你们又不是牙仙子
You're not the tooth fairy.

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,170
不  我们就是想来看看她来了没
N-no. But we just wanted to see if she'd come yet.

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,030
没呢  看来她真的一点都不着急
No. She sure is taking her sweet time.

20
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,680
-也许你该继续睡觉  亲爱的  -对
- Maybe you should just go back to sleep, sweetie. - Yeah.

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,570
因为可能还要再等一会儿
'cause it could take a while.

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,990
我时间多的是
I've got nowhere to be.

23
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,210
妈  我今天不能迟到 
Mom, I can't be late today.

24
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,830
桑杰·帕特尔和我要解剖一头猪
Sanjay Patel and I are dissecting a pig.

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,850
你这辈子所谓的约会真可悲啊
So sad what passes for a date in your life.

26
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,620
-海莉  -他老是让我拿工具给他
- Haley. - He keeps asking me to hand him all of the instruments.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,330
他想让我扮演护士的角色
He wants me to act like a nurse.

28
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,260
那听起来像是海莉的约会
Now it sounds like a date in Haley's life.

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,890
在你说"不行"之前
Okay, before you say no...

30
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,500
-不行  -你连看都没看呢
- No. - You haven't even seen it yet.

31
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,500
我还是要说不行
Mm, I'm sticking with "No."

32
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,740
这是为卢克的职业日准备的
It's for Luke's Career Day.

33
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,940
我想我可以让孩子们尝试
I thought I'd offer the kids a chance

34
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,190
把脸放在我的身体上
to put their face on my body.

35
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,830
我也刚意识到很变态
I just heard it, too.

36
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,110
你们怎么从来没办过职业日
How come you guys never had a Career Day?

37
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,600
-经费削减  -东北大风暴停课
- Cutbacks. - Nor'easter.

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,930
今天我要讲述我的一生挚爱
Today I get to talk about the love of my life...

39
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,860
住宅房地产
residential real estate.

40
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,040
他真是意识不到自己在说什么
He really doesn't hear it.

41
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,150
我要让卢克感到骄傲
I wanna make Luke proud.

42
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,780
我要成为他的英雄
I wanna be his hero like my dad was

43
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,970
就像以前我父亲向我的同学们
when he talked to my class

44
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,060
讲述开杂货店的故事时那样
about running a grocery store.

45
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,960
他拿着两把带皮套的价格标枪进屋
He came in with two price guns in holsters

46
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,780
在我们的老师还没反应过来时
and marked our teacher at $1.29

47
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,100
给她打了个1.29刀的标签
before she knew what hit her.

48
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,160
我敢说那肯定"很好笑"
I bet that produced a lot of laughs.

49
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,050
克莱尔  拜托
Claire, please.

50
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,720
奥利维亚·伯曼的妈妈
And Olivia Berman's mom

51
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,850
在图书馆的珍本书部工作
works in the rare books department at the library.

52
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,620
真希望我有机会去向她讨教讨教
Hope I get a chance to pick that brain.

53
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,740
看来你们的职业日已经排得满满当当了
Looks like you got quite the Career Day lineup.

54
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,590
我猜他们已经邀请到搞衣柜的人了吧
So I guess they already got a closet guy coming in, huh?

55
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,260
没有  我以为你不想参加
No. I didn't think you'd wanna do it.

56
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,370
我不想  但是  我只是为孩子们感到遗憾
I don't, but you know, I just feel bad for the kids.

57
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,590
衣柜这行有很多有趣的事情
A lot of interesting stories in the closet biz.

58
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,610
你怎么从来没跟我们讲过
Oh. Why have you never told us any?

59
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,570
好吧  比如曾经有个家伙
Okay. Well, for example, there was this guy...

60
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,680
-有100多顶帽子  -然后呢
- must have had over a hundred hats... - Yes?

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,320
我们得想办法把那些帽子都放进衣柜里
And we had to fit them in the closet.

62
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,120
然后呢
Okay?

63
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,480
我们做到了
And we did.

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,350
好吧  也许这不是世上最刺激的职业
All right. Maybe it's not the most exciting career in the world,

65
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,330
但这真的很挣钱
but it pays the bills.

66
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,330
没人嫌弃
No one is complaining.

67
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,870
要问我想不想干别的事情  想啊
Were there other things I'd rather do? Yes.

68
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,910
-但我得维持生计  -别的什么事情
- But I had to make ends meet. - What other things?

69
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,260
我一直想写惊悚小说
Well, I always wanted to write thrillers.

70
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,010
-比如那个帽子的故事吗  -间谍惊悚小说
- Like that hat story? - Spy thrillers.

71
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,550
我已经仔细考虑过主角的身份了
I've been kicking around this character,

72
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,650
中情局探员查克·斯通  他毫不在意
CIA agent Chuck Stone, who doesn't care

73
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,140
自己的古怪行为会惹恼阿灵顿的高层们
how much his antics annoy the brass in Arlington.

74
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,420
你为什么不写写看
Why didn't you ever try it?

75
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,050
我一直忙于工作和家庭
I was busy with work and family.

76
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,090
我本打算离婚后开始写
I was gonna start writing after my divorce,

77
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,530
但是被生活琐事妨碍了
But you know... life got in the way.

78
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,610
你说生活琐事的时候为什么指着我
Why do you point at me when you say "Life"?

79
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,610
我是生活琐事吗
Am I "Life"?

80
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,920
我是说你让我忙碌了起来
I meant you keep my busy.

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,770
你周日睡了3个小时午觉
You had a 3-hour nap on Sunday.

82
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,160
-我很累  -为什么累
- I was tired. From what?

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,110
因为周六睡了两个小时午觉吗
Your 2-hour nap on Saturday?

84
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,940
杰  我跟你在一起5年了
Jay, I've been with you for five years,

85
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,240
可从没听你说过什么写书的事
and I've never heard you mention anything about writing.

86
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,230
我买了台打字机
Hey. I bought a typewriter.

87
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,900
打字机
A typewriter?

88
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,470
你的签售会安排在什么时候
When is your book signing?

89
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,440
1975年吗
1975?

90
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,700
我的小说人物非常可怕
It's a hell of a character.

91
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,960
他们教他如何杀人
They taught him how to kill,

92
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,660
但他从没学过如何去爱
but he never learned to love!

93
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
不不不  等等  等等
No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait. Okay.

94
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,440
爸爸  爸爸  牙仙子来过了
Daddies! Daddies! The tooth fairy came.

95
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,370
-什么  不是吧  -真叫人激动
- What? No way! - Oh, that's so exciting!

96
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,510
她给你带了什么
What'd she bring you?

97
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,680
仙尘啊  真不错
Oh! Fairy dust. Nice touch.

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,240
天呐  太多了
Oh, my gosh, it's a lot.

99
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,640
还有贴纸
Some stickers...

100
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,360
一把牙刷
A toothbrush...

101
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,980
还有一张百元大钞
And a hundred dollar bill!

102
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,680
-什么  -快瞧瞧
- What? Okay. - Look at that.

103
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:48,940
我爱牙仙子
I love the tooth fairy.

104
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,480
牙仙子给我们家女儿100美元呢
The tooth fairy gave our daughter $100.

105
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,090
她不知道一颗牙的市场价格顶多5美元吗
Does she not know that the going rate for a tooth is $5 at the most?

106
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,170
显然  牙仙子搞错了
Well, obviously, the tooth fairy made a mistake.

107
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,300
可能是因为牙仙子
Maybe it's 'cause the tooth fairy

108
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,950
昨晚喝了太多夏敦埃酒
had a little too much chardonnay last night.

109
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,720
我觉得牙仙子能扛得住夏敦埃酒
I think the tooth fairy can handle the chardonnay.

110
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,890
但她恐怕无法接受
What I don't think she can handle

111
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,030
批评别人在漆黑的夜里
is criticizing someone who made an honest mistake

112
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,100
所犯下的无心之过
in the dark of the night.

113
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,760
我要把它放进我的小手包里
I'm gonna put this in my clutch.

114
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,690
我等不及要告诉学校里的每个人了
I can't wait to tell everyone at school!

115
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,450
听着  我们做父母的可不能冒充牙仙
Okay, we cannot be the parents of a 6-year-old

116
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,600
给6岁的女儿一张百元大钞
who gets $100 from the tooth fairy.

117
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,110
我们的孩子才6岁就有手包已经够离谱了
It's bad enough we're the parents of a 6-year-old with a clutch.

118
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,450
那个包从早到晚都可以用
You know, that bag transitions from day to night seamlessly,

119
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,770
而且我不用再在口袋里装蜡笔了
and I no longer have to carry crayons in my front pocket.

120
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,030
不要再争这个了
Can't have this argument again!

121
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,200
安医生  谢谢你
Thank you, Dr. Ann,

122
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,810
向我们展示了真实的心理辅导
for showing us how exciting and surprising

123
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,910
多么令人激动和惊喜
a real live therapy session can be.

124
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,420
我会收好这张名片的
I will hold on to this card.

125
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,250
接下来  有请卢克的爸爸  邓菲先生
Next up, we have Luke's dad, Mr. Dunphy.

126
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,180
谢谢
Hey. Thank you.

127
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,920
你们猜怎么着
Guess what?

128
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,740
你不在家的时候我去过你家
I've been in your house when you weren't home.

129
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,780
还有你家  你家也去过
And yours. And yours.

130
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,250
不  我不是小偷  我是房地产经纪人
No, I'm not a burglar. I'm a realtor.

131
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,840
抱歉我迟到了
Ho! Hey, sorry I'm late!

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
我刚刚又卖出去一座豪宅
I just sold another mansion.

133
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,110
你好吗  亲爱的
How you doin', honey?

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,080
历史充满了激烈的竞争
History is full of great rivalries--

135
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,130
雅典与斯巴达  凯瑞甘与哈丁
Athens and Sparta, Kerrigan and Harding,

136
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,600
菲尔·邓菲和格尔·索普
Phil Dunphy and Gil Thorpe.

137
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,440
现在这种局面  他是汤娅  我是南希
In this scenario, he's the Tonya, I'm the Nancy.

138
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,440
{\an8}[花样滑冰选手汤娅·哈丁攻击了对手南希·凯瑞甘]

139
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,260
注意了  孩子们
Pay attention, kids.

140
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,440
即将演讲的是镇上排名第4的地产经纪人
You're about to hear from the number four realtor in town.

141
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,370
无论如何  我不打算做无聊的演讲
Anyway, uh, I'm not gonna bore you guys with a lecture.

142
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,080
相反  我想让你们看看
Instead, I'd like you to watch

143
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,940
我和一个年轻人之间的对话
as I converse with a young man

144
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,220
他正在思考自己的人生目标
who's wondering what to do with his life.

145
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:24,850
孩子你好
Hey, kid.

146
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,440
孩子  看这里  看这里
Hey, kid, up here! Up here!

147
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,110
老兄  什么事
Yo, dude! Whassup?

148
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,400
我来告诉你什么事
I'll tell you what's up.

149
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,130
我想帮助你
I'm interested in helping you

150
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,320
给你讲讲在房地产界打拼的事情
by telling you all about a career in real estate.

151
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,280
房地产  不就是买房子和卖房子吗
Real estate? Isn't that just buying and selling houses?

152
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,770
我没空搞那个  太没用了
I don't have time for that. Epic fail.

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,890
看来我们得从头讲起了
Sounds like we need to start at the beginning.

154
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,730
你看  房地产这行的重点就是人
You see, real estate is about people.

155
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,710
人
People?

156
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,170
你说得太对了菲尔  我们这份工作
Couldn't agree more, Phil. Best part of our job

157
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,610
最大的妙处就是让对的人住进对的家
is putting the right person in the right home.

158
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,100
-格尔  -实际上  就在上周
- Gil... - Matter of fact, last week,

159
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,750
我让一对"西班牙"夫妇住进了
I put a "Spanish" Couple into

160
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,070
{\an8}[美国人把所有拉丁美洲人都叫做西班牙人]

161
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,070
-西班牙式的房子  -格尔
- a Spanish home. - Gil.

162
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,210
一个没有房子的世界  那真是太疯狂了
A world without houses? That's cray cray.

163
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:00,910
好的  好的
Okay. Okay.

164
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,660
菲尔对不起  我不是故意搞砸你的表演
Phil, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to screw up your little show.

165
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,340
我知道这种表演把握好时间最重要
I know timing is critical on these things.

166
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,900
-拜托格尔  -相信我  我最不想
- Gil, please. - Believe me, the last thing I want to do is...

167
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,710
7频道天气预报员的房子是你卖给他的吗
You sold a house to the channel 7 weatherman?

168
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,960
不  不是
No. No.

169
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,760
但科比·布莱恩特有套房子是我卖给他的
But I did sell one to Kobe Bryant.

170
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,560
什么  他不是在跟你说话  是跟我
What?! Guess what? He's not talking to you. He's talking to me.

171
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,660
其实我有个很好笑的故事要讲
And I have a very funny story, actually.

172
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,350
-有个人走进...不  -太好笑了
- A guy walks into... No. - That's hilarious.

173
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,720
不  我还没讲呢
No! I haven't told it!

174
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,050
好吧  对了
Okay, um... Oh!

175
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,070
好球  你说得对
Great throw. You were right.

176
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,890
-确实该看我的了  -就看你的了
- It is in my court. - Ball's in your court!

177
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,410
但你们猜怎么着  其实一直都是我
But guess what-- it was me the whole time.

178
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,170
怎样
What?!

179
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,980
快点孩子们  快点
Come on, kids, come on.

180
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,600
鼓起掌来  鼓起来  他尽力了
Give it up! Give it up! He tried.

181
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,640
我想我们都明白你的意思  菲尔
I think we all know what you were going for, Phil.

182
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,160
不过我看到有几个孩子饿了
But I'm lookin' out here, and I'm seeing some hungry kids.

183
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,250
我说对了没  所以我才买了这么多的
Am I right? That's why I brought plenty of...

184
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,990
格尔腌黄瓜
Gil pickles!

185
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,780
谁想来个格尔腌黄瓜
Who wants a Gil pickle?

186
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,760
来吧  我看都有谁
Come on. Let me see 'em.

187
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,220
好的  来吧  来拿吧
All right. Come on. Grab one.

188
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,630
格尔腌黄瓜
Gil pickles.

189
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,650
太有才了
Genius.

190
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,290
比我的菲尔枕套强多了
So much better than my Phil-low cases.

191
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,790
克莱尔都不喜欢
Claire wasn't a fan.

192
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,290
床上有一个他已经足够了
One of him in bed is more than enough.

193
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,680
听到了吗  女士们
Do you hear that, ladies?

194
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,720
好了  点击"发送"键
All right. Just hit "Send."

195
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,730
你刚刚卖出了一幢房子
Hey! You just sold a house!

196
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,910
而那就是你余生要追求的高目标
And you're gonna be chasing that high for the rest of your life.

197
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,240
大家给她鼓鼓掌吧
Give her a round of applause, everybody.

198
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,340
她刚刚卖出了一幢房子
She just sold a house.

199
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,570
孩子们  感谢你们今天请我来
I wanna thank you kids for having me here today.

200
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,760
请记住房地产这一行的三大准则
And remember the three rules of real estate--

201
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,220
索普  索普  索普
Thorpe, Thorpe, Thorpe!

202
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,070
谢谢你  索普先生
Thank you, Mr. Thorpe.

203
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,430
看来我们还剩下一些时间
It turns out we have a little extra time.

204
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,970
-邓菲太太  -怎么了
- Uh, Mrs. Dunphy? - Yes?

205
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,090
同学们一定想听听你的工作
I'm sure the class would love to hear from you.

206
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,010
不  我只是过来给我老公帮忙的
Oh, no. I just came in to help my husband.

207
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,230
我是个全职主妇
I'm a... I'm a stay-at-home mom.

208
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,850
我知道  那也是个很重要的职业
I know. And that's a very important job.

209
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,800
没错  好吧
It is. Uh, yeah.

210
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,820
我可以  我可以讲一讲
I can--I can do this for a minute.

211
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,750
全职主妇
Um, stay-at-home mom.

212
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,100
那就意味着  我实际上
Uh, what that means is I actually have

213
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,250
要做好几项不同的工作
a whole bunch of different jobs.

214
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,710
我既是司机  也是厨师
I am a chauffeur, a chef,

215
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,550
还是管家
Uh, a house manager,

216
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,150
-护士  -这是你小时候的理想吗
- A nurse. - Is it what you always wanted to do?

217
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,120
不  不算吧
No. Not exactly.

218
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,070
我上过大学  学的是市场营销
Uh, I went to college, uh, to study marketing

219
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,590
还在一家大型酒店企业工作过
and worked at one of those big hotel companies.

220
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,950
但自从我有了孩子
But when my kids came along,

221
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,810
我就想在家照顾他们
I just wanted to be there.

222
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,140
给他们擦鼻涕  给他们换尿布
You know, wipe their noses and change their diapers

223
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,410
夜里给他们盖好被子
And tuck 'em in at night.

224
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,220
妈妈
Mom!

225
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,530
郑重声明  我擦什么都是自己擦的
For the record, I do all my own wiping.

226
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,280
那你为什么不重返职场呢
So why haven't you gone back to work?

227
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,110
我最近做了很多事  我整修了一幢房子
I've done a few things lately. I just redid a house,

228
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,790
去年还参选了市政议员
and I ran for city council last year.

229
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,920
你现在是市政议员吗
You're on the city council?

230
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,590
不  我没当上
No. I-I didn't win.

231
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,160
-你输了  -不是说了"没当上"吗
- You lost? - That's what "Didn't win" means.

232
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,700
我本来想等孩子们长大些
I... I thought I would be going back to work

233
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,850
就回去工作
when the kids got older,

234
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:32,490
不过  这事没有你们想的那么简单
But it--it's not as easy as you might think.

235
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,200
要知道  一个年近40的女人
You know, people aren't exactly lining up

236
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,570
在职场上并不抢手
to hire a woman who's almost 40

237
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,500
何况我都15年没有工作了
and has been out of the job market for 15 years.

238
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,020
我记得你已经42岁了
I thought you were 42.

239
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,550
42和40很接近  卢克
That's almost 40, Luke.

240
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,320
我4岁时我妈妈就回去工作了
My mom went back to work when I was 4.

241
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,420
所以你家才没有人教你不要打断别人说话
Oh, so there was no one at home to teach you not to interrupt?

242
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,920
好了  好了
Okay. Hey, hey, hey!

243
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
我来告诉你们吧
Let me tell you something.

244
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,200
全职妈妈们都是英雄
Stay-at-home moms are heroes.

245
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,020
-没错  -她们是这个国家的栋梁
- Yeah. - They're the backbone of this country.

246
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,870
谢了  格尔
Thanks, Gil.

247
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,940
如果非要我做那样的工作
I mean, if I had to do that job,

248
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,350
我大概早把自己喝死了  真的
I'd probably drink myself to death, honestly.

249
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,020
好了  我们给她一些掌声吧
All right, let's give her a round of applause, everybody.

250
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:57,720
来嘛
Come on.

251
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,580
来嘛  把手拍响点儿  让我听见
Oh, come on, you can do better than that. Let me hear ya!

252
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,210
很好  很好
All right! All right!

253
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,920
好了  下课了  都走吧
All right, class dismissed. Get out of here!

254
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,510
不
No!

255
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,420
不  不  不
No, no, no.

256
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,680
还有  同学们  还有3个小时才结束
We have... Guys, we have three more hours.

257
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,720
-给  -我的旧打字机
- Here. - My old typewriter.

258
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,790
你不是说你想写作吗  写吧
You said you want to write. Write.

259
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,980
现在吗  我今天很忙
Now? I've got a busy day.

260
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,050
我已经给你办公室打过电话了
I already called your office

261
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,390
告诉他们  你今天不会去公司
And told them that you can't come in

262
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,980
乱晃上20分钟
to walk around for 20 minutes

263
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,550
跟每个人说  "怎么样  小子"
saying to everyone, "What's up, sport?"

264
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,180
我明白  你暗含的意思是
I know this is your subtle little way

265
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,830
你觉得我写不出东西
of saying you don't think I can do it.

266
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,380
不  我是让生活琐事为你让路
No. It's life getting out of the way.

267
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,550
好吧  我这就接受你的小小挑战
Fine. I'm gonna take you up on your little challenge,

268
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,490
不过你要知道
but you should know this--

269
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,400
等你人老珠黄那天  你这种行为
this behavior of yours is not gonna fly

270
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,300
就不会得逞了
when you lose your looks.

271
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,730
到那时你都死好久了
You're gonna be long gone by then.

272
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,460
-邓菲  -有事吗
- Dunphy. - Yeah? Oh.

273
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,910
-你还好吗  -我很好  我很好
- You okay? - I'm fine. I'm fine.

274
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,850
别因为那个自作聪明的小屁孩烦心
Don't let that little smart-ass bother you, all right.

275
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:55,030
你见过她妈妈没有  人老珠黄憔悴损
Have you seen her mother? Does not age well.

276
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,220
谢谢你帮我解围
well, um, thanks for rescuing me in there.

277
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,610
顺便帮我跟菲尔说声抱歉吧
And tell Phil I'm sorry

278
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,430
我刚刚可能让他难堪了
if I threw him off in there.

279
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,660
我真是应该学着管好自己的大嘴巴
I probably should learn just to keep my big blowhole shut.

280
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,500
其实那已经比他排练时好很多了
Actually, it went a little better than it did in rehearsal,

281
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,190
说真的
to be honest.

282
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,130
-不过我会向他转达  -好
- But I will tell him what you said. - All right.

283
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,990
你刚才略为抓狂的表现让我想起些事情
You know, your little meltdown in there got me thinking.

284
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,840
我正在开发一处零售和办公区
I'm building a retail office development,

285
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,850
因此我需要有人
and I could use a liaison

286
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,020
负责联络规划委员会
to work with the planning commission.

287
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,650
你是要雇用我吗
Are you offering me a job?

288
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,260
是的  你认识市政厅的人
Well, yeah. You know people in city hall,

289
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,850
而且你炒房也炒得很不错
and you did a hell of a job on that flip.

290
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,750
为了你和你家人的安全
And for the safety of you and your family,

291
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,070
我得让你从家里出来
I gotta get you out of that house.

292
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,060
可你和菲尔是竞争对手
But you and Phil are competitors. It--

293
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,820
这事没竞争
Not on this.

294
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,020
听我说  这事要成了  对大家都好
Look, if this works out, everybody's gonna win...

295
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,030
除了我们要赶走的那家热带鱼店
Except for that tropical fish store we're booting out of there.

296
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,130
我对此一点罪恶感都没有
I don't feel bad about that at all.

297
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,430
你能让我回去想几天吗
Can I take a couple of days to think about it?

298
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,300
-没问题  慢慢想  不着急  -好
- Yeah. Yeah. Take your time. No pressure. - Okay.

299
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,090
你想好了  就给我个电话
And when you're ready, just give me a call.

300
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,430
-好的  -木棒上有我电话
- Okay. - Number's on the stick.

301
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,030
好的  格尔腌黄瓜 
Great. Oh, yeah. Okay. Gil pickle.

302
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,550
回见  索普  索普  索普
See ya! Thorpe! Thorpe! Thorpe!

303
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,560
索普  索普  索普
Thorpe. Thorpe. Thorpe.

304
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,800
猜我在信箱里发现了什么
Look what just came in the mail--

305
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,230
莉莉  是寄给你的信
A letter addressed to you, Lily.

306
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,320
是吗  很少有人寄信给我
Really? I don't get much mail.

307
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,370
我们看看
Oh, let's see here.

308
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,500
是牙仙子寄来的
Uh, yeah. Oh, the tooth fairy.

309
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,240
牙达科他州  牙市 牙仙子街1号
"1 Tooth Fairy Lane. Tooth City, Tooth Dakota."

310
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,170
希望她又送我100美元
I hope it's another $100.

311
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,310
我们看看是什么
Ooh! Well, lookie there.

312
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,510
金粉闪闪啊
Glitter!

313
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,080
估计这牙仙子从来不用扫地吧
I guess the tooth fairy doesn't have to worry about vacuuming.

314
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,310
亲爱的莉莉  我来信是因为我犯了错
See, "Dear Lily, I'm writing because I made a mistake"

315
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,330
给了你太多的钱
"and gave you too much money."

316
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,650
请你今晚把那100美元放在枕头下
"Please leave the $100 under your pillow tonight,"

317
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,390
我会给你1美元
"and I'll give you a dollar.

318
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,800
抱歉让你伤心了[咬到你]
Sorry if that bites."

319
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,100
让我看看
Let me see that.

320
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,470
我不识字
I can't read.

321
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,910
听起来她真的很烦恼
Uh, well, it sounds like she's really in a jam.

322
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,070
我觉得  我们必须
And I think we're gonna

323
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,080
把那100美元还给牙仙子
have to give the tooth fairy her $100 back.

324
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,290
不行  我想留着
No! I wanna keep it.

325
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,750
想到要靠她给我们养老
I'm scared that she's gonna be the one

326
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,620
-就觉得好可怕  -是啊
- taking care of us when we're older. - Yeah.

327
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,640
查克·斯通
"Chuck Stone,"

328
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,330
身高6英尺  火眼晶晶坚韧不拔的硬汉
"6-foot, 3-inches of steely eyed determination"

329
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,390
坐在审讯桌前
"sat at the interrogation table."

330
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,740
他的脑海一片空白
"His mind was a blank..."

331
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:59,300
空空如也
"A complete blank.

332
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,540
他一件实在的事情都想不出来
"He literally could not think of one single, solitary thing.

333
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,150
这时  他发现了一块污渍
"Then he noticed a spot."

334
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,740
像是早餐时滴落的糖浆
"It looked like syrup left over from breakfast..."

335
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,980
这让他想起来  该吃午饭了
"Which made him realize it was lunchtime."

336
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,900
他吃了块培根生菜番茄三明治
"A bacon, lettuce, and tomato, sandwich--"

337
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,030
查克·斯通管它叫"培生番"
"Or B.L.T, as Chuck Stone called it--

338
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,960
这顿饭正和他胃口
"would really hit the spot."

339
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,070
查克发现  这美味的诀窍在于蛋黄酱
"The secret, chuck realized, was real mayonnaise..."

340
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,860
而不是他老婆平时买给儿子的健康食品
"Not that healthy crap his wife kept buying for their son."

341
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,620
该死的
Damn it!

342
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,200
一大串T到底是什么意思
"I mean, what's the point of t-t-t-t-t-t-t?"

343
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,520
你和我  共饮茶
"Tea for two. Two for tea."

344
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
之后写的就更加不堪入目了
It only gets worse from here.

345
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
你开什么玩笑
You can't be serious!

346
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,030
格尔·索普是我的死对头
Gil Thorpe is my nemesis!

347
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,070
菲尔  我不想打击你
I hate to break it to you, Phil,

348
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,000
但你不是蝙蝠侠
but you're not Batman.

349
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,710
相信我
Trust me.

350
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,530
格尔非常阴险  他是利用你来对付我
Gil's a snake and he's found the perfect way to mess with me.

351
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,030
你就从来没想过也许他想雇我是因为
Did it ever occur to you that he was hiring me because of...

352
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,540
不知道  我很能干
I don't know? Me.

353
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,610
你开什么玩笑  你到底是谁的老婆
Are you kidding? What's your last name?!

354
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,520
现在还真难说
Right now?

355
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,620
对不起  克莱尔
I'm sorry, Claire.

356
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,280
我也不想  但我要行使我的否决权
I-I hate to do this, but I have to use my veto.

357
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,730
否决权  你才没有什么否决权
Veto? Oh, you don't get any vetoes.

358
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,540
你总是否决我
You veto me all the time.

359
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,050
因为你的想法都太蠢了
'Cause you have dumb ideas.

360
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,280
你倒是举个例子听听
Name one.

361
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,980
她说了好久
That went on for a while.

362
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,330
还有在浴室里存零食的主意
...And let's not forget shower snacks.

363
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,220
不可能只有我会洗澡洗得肚子饿
I can't be the only one who gets hungry in there!

364
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,690
杰  我妈说你在写书
Hey, Jay. My mom said you were writing a book.

365
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,370
真是帅呆了啊
That's fantastic.

366
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,950
顺便提一句  今天的职业日有点奇怪
By the way, Career Day was a little weird.

367
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,150
我觉得克莱尔最近心情不好
I think Claire's going through some pretty dark stuff,

368
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,520
-你也许该去关心一下  -别闲聊了
- and you might want to check... - Enough chitchat.

369
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,290
我正想办法让我的主角走出困境呢
I've gotta get a character out of a bind.

370
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,740
他怎么了
Ooh. What did he do?

371
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,470
他跟他老婆说  他能写本书
He told his wife he could write a book.

372
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,570
别放弃  杰  自我怀疑是个必经过程
Don't give up, Jay. Self-doubt is part of the process.

373
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,560
如果你不自我批判
You can't be a good writer

374
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,230
你就成不了一个好作家
without being critical of your own work.

375
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,700
怎么了
What?

376
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,000
我实在想不出好话来鼓励你
I'm racking my brain for a compliment here.

377
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,530
我知道  写得烂透了
I know. It stinks.

378
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,950
这回要让你妈看笑话了
And your mom's gonna rub it in my face pretty good.

379
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,920
好  查克·斯通为什么要审问这个人
Okay. Why is Chuck Stone interrogating this guy?

380
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,830
他需要知道密码  否则的话
He needs the codes. If he doesn't get 'em,

381
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,380
国际空间站就会
the International Space Station's gonna

382
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,730
在除夕夜坠落在时代广场
crash into Times Square on New Year's Eve.

383
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:53,970
所以他时间无多了
So he's short of time.

384
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,530
他只剩两分钟  他走投无路了
He's got about two minutes. He's desperate.

385
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,280
这样如何
How about this?

386
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,940
查克·斯通笑了笑  点燃一支烟
"Chuck Stone smiled and lit a cigarette,"

387
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,020
仿佛他还有大把的时间
"as if he had all the time in the world,"

388
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,940
然而其实  地球快要毁灭了
when in fact, the world was about to end."

389
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,360
精彩啊  然后呢然后呢
Holy crap. What happens next?

390
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,690
你让开  我来写
Move over. I'll type.

391
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,990
给我来点咖啡吧  谢谢
Some coffee would be great. Thanks.

392
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,320
抱歉  但我不明白为什么
I'm sorry. I don't understand why

393
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,250
我们不能直接走进去
we don't just go in there,

394
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,080
告诉她我们要把钱拿走  就完事了
we tell her we're taking the money, and that's that.

395
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,520
因为这是个教育孩子的机会
Because this is a teaching moment,

396
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,750
我们得引导她自愿把钱交出来
and we want her to want to give the money back.

397
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,900
我只是非常担心
I'm just really worried

398
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,000
我们要成为过分放纵孩子的家长了
we're becoming those overindulgent parents right now.

399
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,320
别傻了
Don't be silly.

400
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,860
好  牙仙子  你准备好了吗
Okay, you ready, tooth fairy?

401
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,120
-行动吧  -好吧
- Let's do this. - All right.

402
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,090
莉莉  看谁来了
Lily, look who came to say hi!

403
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,220
是我  牙仙子
It's me, the tooth fairy.

404
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,560
我来是想请你帮个忙
And I've come to ask you for a favor!

405
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,930
你真的是牙仙子吗
Are you really the tooth fairy?

406
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,730
是的  看我的翅膀
Oh, yes, I am. Look at my wings!

407
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,860
你会飞吗  我想看你飞
Can you fly? I wanna see you fly.

408
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,190
我现在飞不了  因为...
Well, I can't right now because...

409
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,120
因为...
Well, because--

410
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,450
因为牙仙子太伤心了
Because the tooth fairy's too sad to fly...

411
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,880
因为她犯了错  只有你能帮她解决
Because she made a mistake that only you can make better.

412
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,860
又是因为那钱吗
Is this about the money again?

413
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,920
是的  没错
Well, yes, it is.

414
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,050
我还得留着钱给别的小盆友呢
I need enough for all the other children's tooths.

415
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,430
-小朋友  -慢着
- Teeth. - Wait a minute.

416
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,200
你不是牙仙子  你是海莉
You're not the tooth fairy. You're Haley.

417
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,350
不  我是牙仙子
No! I am the tooth fairy!

418
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,470
看  我有仙女金粉
Look! Fairy dust!

419
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,550
金粉又得辛苦我扫地了
And there's that glitter.

420
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,930
你们为什么撒谎
Why did you lie?

421
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,470
你们说过撒谎是不对的
You said lying was wrong.

422
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,300
我们也说过  要帮助遇到困难的人
We also said that when someone is in trouble, you help them.

423
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,700
我怎么知道你们不是在骗我
How do I know you weren't lying?

424
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,650
她太聪明了
She is good.

425
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,190
好吧莉莉  不胡闹了
All right, Lily, this is ridiculous.

426
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:45,630
牙仙子犯了个错
All right, the tooth fairy has made a mistake.

427
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,660
你必须把那100美元放到枕头下
You need to put the $100 under the pillow,

428
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,460
就这样  没得商量
and that is the end of the story.

429
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,980
因为你觉得这样做是对的
Because you believe it's the right thing to do...

430
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:51,840
-没错  -对吧
- Yes. - Don't you?

431
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,820
可是我想买滑板车
But I wanna buy a scooter.

432
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,250
换我也会这么做
Oh. That's what I'd do.

433
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,290
我是说
I mean...

434
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,940
管他圣诞老人怎么想呢
Who cares what Santa thinks, right?

435
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,930
圣诞老人
Santa?

436
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,690
对啊  他全都看在眼里
Well, he sees everything,

437
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,660
这事恐怕会让他把你放进坏孩子名单
And this'll probably put you on the "Naughty" list.

438
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,450
可你根本不必每年等他来给你送礼物
But who needs presents every year?

439
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,950
因为你自己都有100美元了
You've got a hundred dollars.

440
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,160
你可以骑着滑板车在空空的圣诞树下
You can ride around that empty christmas tree

441
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,590
晃悠到变成老太太为止
until you're an old lady.

442
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,210
可以给我些时间考虑下吗
Can I have some time to think about it?

443
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,280
-你不需要时间  -当然可以  宝贝
- You don't need any... - Of course, sweetie.

444
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,340
好的
Yeah. Okay.

445
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
海莉  这招太高了
Haley? Okay, that was brilliant.

446
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,520
多谢  这身行头可以借我吗
Thanks. Oh, also, can I borrow this?

447
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,270
-为什么  -我还是不说的好
- Why? - I'd rather not say.

448
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,340
我戴上假发后
You know, after I put on the wig,

449
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,060
可以感觉到融入角色了
I just... I felt like the character.

450
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,340
等等
Hang on.

451
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,210
侬好哇
Yell-o?

452
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,140
问一下  这是真正的菲尔还是视频菲尔
Quick question. Am I talking to live Phil or video Phil?

453
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,770
你想干嘛  格尔
What do you want, Gil?

454
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,930
只想确定下你不介意你老婆叫我"大老板"
I just wanna make sure it's okay that your wife calls me "Boss."

455
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,380
-再见  -慢着  别挂
- Good-bye. - Oh, hold on! Hold on!

456
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,760
我逗你玩儿呢
I'm just messing with ya.

457
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,610
但我的确认为
Although I do think

458
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,030
你老婆会很享受在我"下面"办事
your wife's gonna enjoy being under me.

459
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,380
我儿子在车里
My son is in the car.

460
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,440
大明星  还好吗
Hey, superstar! What's up?

461
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,350
听着  任何时候你想来海边别墅
Listen, any time you wanna swing by the beach house,

462
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,530
我都很乐意教你如何扔橄榄回旋球
I'll be glad to show you how to throw a tight spiral

463
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,300
就像我当年在德州理工那样  好耶
like I did at Texas Tech. Booyah!

464
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,580
-汤米  -他已经会扔了
- Tommy! - He already knows how to throw.

465
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,360
-我的同志舅夫小卡教我了  -让我来
- Yeah, my gay uncle Cam taught me. - I-I got this.

466
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,580
这是我们的恩怨  不能把家人扯进来
This was between us. You don't bring family into it.

467
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,470
让克莱尔空欢喜一场  你真是卑鄙
Low blow getting Claire's hopes up.

468
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,650
我没有让她空欢喜一场
Hey, I'm not getting her hopes up.

469
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,910
这是有着真正好处的真正工作
This is a real job with real bennies--

470
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,920
其中一项好处就是
One of which is

471
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,560
任何时候她俯身在我桌前
I get to tell you what I'm thinking

472
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,420
我都可以告诉你我的想法
whenever she leans over my desk!

473
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,470
这下我真是要开心死了
Oh, I'm gonna have so much fun with this! 

474
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,860
回见了  小邓邓  
Later, Dunph-bags!

475
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,880
真是个混蛋
What a jerk.

476
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,840
知道吗  得在你妈妈
You know what? We're gonna tell your mom

477
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,560
答应与他合作前  告诉她
before she goes into business with this guy.

478
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,530
他真是"格"犹如"索普在背"的烦人精
He's Gil-ty of being a Thorpe in my side.

479
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,530
{\an8}[原词为Thorn in my side: 芒刺在背]

480
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,440
太刻意了
Trying too hard.

481
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,190
是的
Yeah.

482
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,480
我回来了
Hello!

483
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,350
闪一边去
Move!

484
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,050
你没事
You're fine.

485
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,800
怎么样
So?

486
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,690
第一天写作如何啊
How was your first day of writing?

487
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,680
歌洛莉亚  安静  让我写完最后一句
Gloria, shh! Let me finish one thought.

488
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,930
好了
Got it.

489
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,390
你真的写出了东西吗
So you actually wrote something?

490
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,590
开始比较不顺
Well, it was slow going at first,

491
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,300
然后就文思如泉涌了
but then the juices started flowing.

492
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,990
-我能看看吗  -当然
- May I? - Sure.

493
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,940
如果有帮助的话  把主角意淫成汤姆·贝伦杰
Uh, if it helps, picture Tom Berenger.

494
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,940
{\an8}[演员  代表作为电影《野战排》]

495
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,070
我总是意淫着别人
I always do.

496
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,020
怎么了
What?

497
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,250
只是
Well, it's just this...

498
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,850
第一句有点长啊
This first sentence is a bit long.

499
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,310
是长还是生动形象
Long or dynamic?

500
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,920
又长又令人迷惑  我分不清是谁在说话
No, long and confusing. I can't tell who's talking.

501
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,110
也许这是模仿《战争迷雾》
Maybe that's just to mimic The Fog of Battle.

502
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,110
{\an8}[电影原名为The Fog of War]

503
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,210
好吧
Okay.

504
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,650
又怎么了
What now?

505
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,830
只是  1965年时没有手机
Just... There were no cell phones in 1965.

506
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,200
那是个错误  我会改的
That's a mistake. I'm changing that.

507
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,600
不能改  结尾又会出现
You can't change that. It comes back in the end...

508
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,550
我猜想的
I-I presume.

509
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,170
重点是  我可以写作
The point is, I can write.

510
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,560
我可能不会以此为业
I probably won't pursue it,

511
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,420
但这是可行的职业选择
but it's a viable career option.

512
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,370
中情局有着各种顶级机密的高科技
The CIA had all sorts of top-secret technology.

513
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,090
你怎么知道他们当时没有手机
Who's to say they didn't have cell phones?

514
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,130
曼尼  算了
Manny, let it go.

515
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,400
这个查克·斯通
And this Chuck Stone--

516
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,010
似乎不太擅长他的工作啊
He doesn't seem very good at his job.

517
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,470
他有缺点  这样角色才会有趣
He's flawed. That's what makes the character interesting.

518
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,040
如果你要完美的  用机器人好了
If you want someone perfect, put in a robot.

519
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,490
机器人
A robot!

520
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,690
我喜欢机器人
I like a robot.

521
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,270
不  我的故事中不能有机器人
No! You're not putting a robot in my story!

522
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,360
没错  这是我写的
That's right, my story.

523
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,590
你肯定开心死了
You must be very happy.

524
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,420
我本该开心的  但生活妨碍了我开心
I would be, but life got in the way.

525
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,460
你在做什么
What are you doing?

526
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,050
找出了我以前的公文包
Oh, I just got out my old briefcase.

527
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,760
还是可以重返职场的
It's still capable of doing the job,

528
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,070
和我一样
Just like me.

529
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,600
克莱尔  有些事你得知道
Claire, you have to understand something.

530
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,930
有些事你得知道
You have to understand something.

531
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,920
我整天都沉浸在幸福之中
I walked around all day on cloud nine

532
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,460
因为有人赏识我的价值
because somebody valued me.

533
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,680
我赏识你的价值  我们都如此
I value you. We all value you.

534
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,550
你们当然赏识
No, of course you do,

535
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,300
因为我做饭  打扫  收拾脏内衣
Because I cook and I clean and I pick up dirty underwear.

536
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,950
亲爱的  这个不一样
No, honey, it's different than that.

537
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,020
我已经做旁观者很多年了
I have been on the sidelines for so long,

538
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,830
我不知道是否还会有人认为
I didn't know if anybody would ever think

539
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,950
我有能力重新工作
I have what it takes again.

540
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,580
我知道格尔不是什么好人
I know Gil's not the greatest guy,

541
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,670
但这很重要  我想
But this is important. And I think--

542
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,870
我想你应该接受这份工作
I think you should take the job.

543
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,140
但是  爸
But, dad...

544
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,820
不  卢克  你妈说得对
No, Luke. She's right.

545
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,630
她会非常出色的
Your mom's gonna be amazing at this.

546
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,570
-我收回否决权  -你从未有过否决权
- I retract my veto. - You never had a veto.

547
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,640
-我有  -你没有  我告诉你为什么
- Yes, I did. - No, you didn't, and I'll tell you why.

548
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,610
她又说了好久
And that went on for a while.

549
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,680
最后  这番对话就会发生在
...And lastly, this whole conversation would be happening

550
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,700
-圆顶帐篷中  -那是完美的结构
- in a yurt. - It's the perfect structure.

551
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,100
我得把旧西装里的垫肩都拿掉
I have to go take the shoulder pads out of all my old suits!

552
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,250
你知道他会继续取笑你吧
You know he's gonna keep teasing you.

553
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,710
只要你妈妈开心  我能承受几个电话
If it makes your mom happy, I can handle a few phone calls.

554
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,330
还有短信
And texts. 

555
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,450
-说了什么  -没什么我不能承受的
- What does it say? - Nothing I can't handle.

556
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,790
"我们都在编织着谎言之网
"We all weave a web of lies."

557
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,740
有些谎言  是为了帮助所爱的人
"Some we tell to try to help the ones we love."

558
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,490
有些谎言  是为了欺骗自己"
"Some we tell to try to fool ourselves."

559
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,400
"有些谎言  是因为  
"And some we tell because,

560
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,490
当子弹用尽
when you're out of bullets

561
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:42,060
凝视着冲锋枪的枪管时
and staring down the barrel of a kalashnikov,

562
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,600
剩下的武器只有  诡计"
the only weapon you've got left is guile."

563
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,690
你妈妈太不识货了  这棒极了
She's nuts. That's fantastic.

564
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,490
孩子们  快过来
Okay, guys, bring it in!

565
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,950
在妈妈回家前  我们要把家里收拾干净
Let's get this place shipshape before she gets home.

566
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,420
我肯定她第一天上班很辛苦
I'm sure she had a big first day.

567
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,270
海莉  你负责洗衣服
Haley, I'm putting you on laundry.

568
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,530
艾丽克斯  收拾厨房与吸尘
Alex, kitchen and vacuum.

569
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,890
卢克  你清洁厕所
Luke, you're cleaning the bathroom.

570
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,900
为什么是我
Why me?

571
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,150
因为弄脏的人总是你
Because you always mess it up.

572
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,020
你为什么不能尿在马桶里呢
Yeah, why can't you pee straight?

573
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,110
站得那么远  我已经很不错了
Hey, I'm doing a great job from that far back.

574
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,350
好了孩子们  邓菲队数到三加油
Okay, guys, team Dunphy on three.

575
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,170
一  二  对了  有许多事要做
One, two--that's right, we got a lot to do!

576
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,420
亲爱的  你怎么这么早就回来了
Honey, what are you doing home so early?

577
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,810
我辞职了  那家伙是头彻头彻尾的猪 
I quit. That man is a complete pig.

578
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,290
他把我当仆人一样使唤
He treated me like a servant

579
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,010
完全不尊重我
and showed me absolutely no respect.

580
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,980
太遗憾了  你不该受到那样的待遇
I'm so sorry. You deserve better than that.

581
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,930
的确是
I do.

582
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,210
晚饭吃什么
So what's for dinner?

583
