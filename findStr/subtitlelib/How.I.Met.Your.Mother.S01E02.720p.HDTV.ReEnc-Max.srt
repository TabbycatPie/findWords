00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,792
- OLDER TED: Okay, where was I?
- You were telling us how you met Mom.

3
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:18,199
- In excruciating detail.
- Right.

4
00:00:18,295 --> 00:00:23,140
So, back in 2005, when I was 27,
my two best friends got engaged.

5
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:25,708
<i>And it got me thinking,
maybe I should get married.</i>

6
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:29,458
<i>And then I saw Robin. She was incredible.</i>

7
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:32,864
<i>I just knew I had to meet her.
That's where your Uncle Barney came in.</i>

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,232
I suggest we play a little game
I like to call, 'Have you met Ted?'

9
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:38,350
No, no, no, no, we're not playing
'Have you met Ted.'

10
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:40,369
Hi, have you met Ted?

11
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,869
<i>So I asked her out,
and I know this sounds crazy,</i>

12
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:46,308
<i>but after just one date
I was in love with her,</i>

13
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:48,266
<i>which made me say something stupid.</i>

14
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:49,581
I think I'm in love with you.

15
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:50,607
What?

16
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:53,679
- Oh, Dad.
- So then what happened?

17
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:55,934
<i>Nothing.</i>

18
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,404
<i>I mean, I'd made a complete fool of myself.</i>

19
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,196
<i>So, a week went by
and I decided not to call her.</i>

20
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:02,768
So, you're not gonna call her?

21
00:01:02,865 --> 00:01:04,437
You went from 'I think I'm in love with you'

22
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:05,656
to 'I'm not gonna call her'?

23
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:07,068
I wasn't in love with her, okay?

24
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:10,309
I was briefly in love with
the abstract concept of getting married.

25
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,941
It had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.

26
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:14,128
- Robin?
- Hey.

27
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:15,572
Look who I ran into.

28
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:17,080
Since when do you guys know each other?

29
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:19,099
Oh, since about here.

30
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:22,246
Lily recognized me from the news...

31
00:01:22,342 --> 00:01:25,612
- Hello, sailor.
- They just got engaged.

32
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:30,302
Well, I should get back to the station.
See you guys.

33
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:33,014
- Nice seeing you, Ted.
- Yeah, you, too.

34
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,033
Thanks.

35
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:36,672
- Damn it!
- What?

36
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,057
- I'm in love with her.
- No.

37
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:41,806
As your sponsor, I will not let you relapse.

38
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:44,277
- You blew it. It's over. Move on.
- I don't know.

39
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:47,421
I just have this feeling she's the future
Mrs. Ted Mosby.

40
00:01:47,518 --> 00:01:49,025
(SQUEAKING)

41
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:50,727
Lily, you squeaked?

42
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:53,903
She said something about me, didn't she?
Come on, spill it, Red.

43
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:55,219
Fine.

44
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,604
So, what do we think of Ted?

45
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:00,449
Ted's something else.

46
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:01,604
Huh?

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,016
I'm gonna spin that as good.

48
00:02:03,112 --> 00:02:05,680
Lots of guys are something,
I'm something else.

49
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,219
He comes on a little strong.

50
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:09,623
But that's part of my charm.

51
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:12,097
- But that's part of his charm.
- Oh, totally.

52
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:15,016
I mean, he's sweet, he's charming,
he's just looking for something...

53
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:16,782
a little bit more serious than I am.

54
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,215
I mean, the most I can handle right now
is something casual.

55
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:23,135
- This just stays between us, right?
- Are you kidding?

56
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:25,375
This flapper, Fort Knox.

57
00:02:26,248 --> 00:02:27,883
Oops.

58
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,456
She wants casual?

59
00:02:29,552 --> 00:02:31,532
Okay, I'll be casual.

60
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:34,429
I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual.

61
00:02:34,526 --> 00:02:36,740
You know why? 'Cause it's a game.

62
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:39,499
I wanted to skip to the end
and do the whole happily-ever-after thing,

63
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:42,003
but you don't get there
unless you play the game.

64
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,634
- So you gonna ask her out?
- Yeah. No!

65
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,516
I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out
I'm asking her out.

66
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:52,372
So how do I ask her out
without asking her out?

67
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,563
Did you guys get high?

68
00:02:57,918 --> 00:03:00,370
I got it. I don't ask her out.

69
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,495
I invite her to our party next Friday.

70
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:06,133
- We're having a party next Friday?
- We are now.

71
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,223
Casual.

72
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,694
Yeah, 'cause nothing says 'casual'
like inviting a hundred people...

73
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,531
over just to mack on one girl.
Oh, and Lily, that's my leg.

74
00:03:14,956 --> 00:03:18,226
You waited five minutes to tell me that?

75
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:21,694
- All right, so call her up.
- No, calling's not casual.

76
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,588
I just got to bump into her somewhere.

77
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:26,668
Now, if only I knew her schedule,
I could arrange a chance encounter.

78
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:31,423
That's great, Ted.
You'll be the most casual staIker ever.

79
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:35,121
<i>Now, ever since Marshall
put that ring on her finger,</i>

80
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:38,871
<i>Lily had been, well, extra affectionate.</i>

81
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,440
Baby, no.

82
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:44,459
I have a 25-page paper
on constitutional law due Monday.

83
00:03:44,555 --> 00:03:45,902
I've barely started.

84
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:49,513
Hey, I'm just sitting here wearing my ring.

85
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,997
My beautiful ring.

86
00:03:53,186 --> 00:03:56,587
Kind of makes wearing other stuff
seem wrong.

87
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,385
My shirt.

88
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,832
Kind of don't wanna wear
my shirt anymore.

89
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,957
Or my underwear.

90
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,356
That's right. I'm not wearing any.

91
00:04:08,684 --> 00:04:09,647
(SIGHING)...

92
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:12,718
- No underwear?
- Not even slightly.

93
00:04:12,824 --> 00:04:14,747
Guys.

94
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:17,249
Boundaries.

95
00:04:18,278 --> 00:04:20,076
<i>- There she is.
- Thanks, Bill.</i>

96
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:22,514
<i>I'm reporting from
the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket...</i>

97
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,655
<i>on 75th and Columbus...</i>

98
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,805
75th and Columbus.

99
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:28,899
Game on!

100
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:30,632
...where four-year-old Leroy Ellenberg...

101
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:35,469
has climbed inside a Grab-A-Prize machine
and gotten stuck.

102
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:41,060
And all in the pursuit
of a stuffed, purple giraffe.

103
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,238
For Metro News 1, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

104
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,575
PRODUCER: We're clear.
ROBIN: Thanks, Don.

105
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:48,999
Ted?

106
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:52,670
- Robin? Wow, what are the odds?
- What are you doing here?

107
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:56,224
Oh, you know, just shopping for dip.

108
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,216
I love dip. No, I don't love dip. I like dip.

109
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:01,325
As a friend, you know.

110
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,901
So, hey, you reporting a news story
or something?

111
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:07,527
Yeah, a kid stuck in a crane machine.
How sweet of you to call it news.

112
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:10,249
Wow, kid in a crane machine.

113
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,083
You just had to have that toy, didn't you?

114
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,752
Couldn't play the game like everyone else.

115
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,771
You're all sweaty.

116
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,602
Cute kid.

117
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,400
You know, it's so funny
I should run into you.

118
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:22,031
We're having a party next Friday
if you feel like swinging by,

119
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,892
but, you know, whatever.

120
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:26,234
Oh, I'm going back home next weekend.

121
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:29,442
- It's too bad it's not tonight.
- It is. It's tonight.

122
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,881
This Friday. Did I say next Friday?
Yeah, sorry.

123
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:33,742
I guess I've been saying
'next Friday' all week.

124
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,989
But, yeah, it's tonight. The party's tonight.

125
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,360
But, you know, whatever.

126
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:42,051
(PHONE RINGING)...

127
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,417
- Hello?
- Hey, am I interrupting anything?

128
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,818
No, no, I'm just writing my paper,
hitting the books.

129
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:52,931
Yeah, well, you and Lily
might want to put some clothes on.

130
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:56,787
We're throwing a party in two hours.
Okay, bye.

131
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,177
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

132
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,520
So, Gatsby, what are you gonna do
when Robin shows up?

133
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:06,060
Okay, I got it all planned out.

134
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:09,623
<i>She steps through the door.
And where is Ted?</i>

135
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,965
<i>Not eagerly waiting by the door.</i>

136
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:14,115
<i>No, I'm across the room
at my drafting table...</i>

137
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,805
<i>showing some foxy young thing
all my cool architecture stuff.</i>

138
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,528
<i>So, Robin strolls over,
and I casually give her one of these,</i>

139
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:23,547
<i>'Hey, what's up?'</i>

140
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:27,463
<i>She says,
'Hey, nice place, etcetera, etcetera.'</i>

141
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,035
<i>And then I say,</i>

142
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:30,672
<i>'Well, make yourself at home.'</i>

143
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:33,592
<i>And I casually return to my conversation.</i>

144
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,898
<i>Then, an hour later,</i>

145
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,974
<i>'Oh, you're still here?'</i>

146
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,416
<i>I say, like I don't really care
but it's a nice surprise.</i>

147
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:44,474
<i>And then, very casually,</i>

148
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:46,746
<i>'Wanna see the roof?'</i>

149
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,250
- The roof.
- The roof.

150
00:06:49,347 --> 00:06:51,754
I get her up to the roof
and the roof takes care of the rest.

151
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,165
What's so special about the roof?

152
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:56,486
Oh, the moon, the stars,
the shimmering skyline.

153
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:59,914
You can't not fall in love on that roof.

154
00:07:00,206 --> 00:07:02,292
We do it up there sometimes.

155
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,019
- Solid plan, my little friends.
- We're the same height.

156
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:08,549
But may I suggest one little modification?

157
00:07:08,998 --> 00:07:10,570
<i>BARNEY: That foxy young thing
you were chatting up?</i>

158
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:12,271
<i>Take her up to the roof
and have sex with her.</i>

159
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,357
<i>- Crazy, monkey-style...
- That's not the plan.</i>

160
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:17,245
<i>It should be the plan. I mean, look at her.
Ted, look at her.</i>

161
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,630
<i>- She's smoking.
- Thank you.</i>

162
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:21,865
<i>- Yeah.
- But she's not Robin.</i>

163
00:07:21,961 --> 00:07:23,181
Exactly.

164
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,753
Ted, let's rap.

165
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:25,780
Statistic.

166
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:27,544
At every New York party
there's always a girl...

167
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:29,277
who has no idea whose party she's at.

168
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:32,357
She knows no one you know
and you will never see her again.

169
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:36,589
Do you see where I'm going, huh,
with this?

170
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,229
Barney, I don't think so.

171
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:42,592
- Scoping, bip, scoping, bip.
- Man, you're a dork.

172
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,353
Bip, bip, bip, bip. Target acquired!

173
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,696
And now it's time we play a little game
I like to call,

174
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,135
- 'Have you met Ted?'
- Oh, come on, not this.

175
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:52,027
- Hi, have you met Ted?
- No.

176
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:53,182
- Hi.
- Hi.

177
00:07:53,278 --> 00:07:55,172
- You know Marshall, Lily?
- No.

178
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:58,766
- Do you know anyone at this party?
- I work with Carlos.

179
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,478
Excuse me. Anyone know a Carlos?

180
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:02,456
- No.
- No.

181
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:06,042
<i>On a silver platter. Bon appétit.</i>

182
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,071
I don't think so.

183
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:11,762
Your loss, her gain.
Excuse me, can I show you the roof?

184
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,462
- It's magical up there.
- Sure.

185
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:15,323
Wait, wait, wait.
Hey, I got that roof reserved.

186
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,833
- Dude, Robin's not coming.
- Hey, she's gonna show up.

187
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,377
She'll show up.

188
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:25,925
<i>OLDER TED: She didn't show up.</i>

189
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:28,415
At least, it was a great party.

190
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:31,290
I ate like four whole cans of dip.

191
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,191
You always know what to say, old friend.

192
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,210
(PHONE RINGING)...

193
00:08:37,753 --> 00:08:39,613
- It's Robin.
- Answer it.

194
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,551
No, no, no, not right away.
I gotta seem casual.

195
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:46,769
- Hello?
- I'm so sorry I missed your party.

196
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:49,491
- Who is this? Meredith?
- Robin.

197
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,069
Oh, Robin.

198
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,961
Hey, yeah,

199
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:55,786
- I guess you never showed up, did you?
- No, I got stuck at work.

200
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,256
But they finally got that kid
out of the crane machine.

201
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:02,395
- Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?
- Yeah, they let him keep all the toys.

202
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:06,695
He was in there a long time
and little kids have small bladders.

203
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,243
I wish your party was tonight.

204
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:12,785
It is. The party's tonight.

205
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:17,725
Yeah, it's a two-day party,
'cause that's just how we roll.

206
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,359
So if you wanna swing by,
you know, it's casual.

207
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:23,379
See you.

208
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:28,450
- So that was Robin.
- What are you doing to me, man?

209
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,274
- I got a paper to write.
- I know, I'm sorry. It's terrible.

210
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,395
- I'll buy more dip.
- Ted, Ted, wait!

211
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,824
Get French Onion!

212
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:44,567
Can you believe this guy?
I got a paper to write.

213
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,735
Okay, fine.
But it's gotta be, like, super quick.

214
00:09:47,831 --> 00:09:52,245
- And no cuddling after.
- I'm the luckiest girl alive.

215
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:59,735
Oh, you were so right about the roof.

216
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:04,013
The roof!
The roof is on fire, Ted!

217
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,653
That girl from last night,
I took her back to my place,

218
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:09,059
then this morning took her outside,
spun her around a couple times...

219
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:09,998
and sent her walking.

220
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:13,720
She will never find her way back
and there she is.

221
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,383
- How did she get here? Did you invite her?
- I have no idea who that is.

222
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,020
She said she works with Carlos.
Who's Carlos?

223
00:10:18,116 --> 00:10:19,046
I don't know any Carlos.

224
00:10:19,142 --> 00:10:20,073
(GRUNTS)...

225
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,955
- Hi, you. You're back.
- I sure am.

226
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,502
- Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.
- Sweetie. Really?

227
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:32,521
Help.

228
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:34,609
Whoa, whoa, rabbits.

229
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:36,791
Come on, I got that roof reserved.

230
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,810
All right.

231
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:42,245
So, it's over between me
and Works with Carlos Girl.

232
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,364
- Oh, that was fast.
- Yeah.

233
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,417
I was trying to think,
what's the quickest way...

234
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,984
to get rid of a girl you just met?

235
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,423
- I think I'm in love with you.
- What?

236
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,298
- Thanks, bro.
- Glad I could help.

237
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:58,386
What the... No, no, no, no, come on.

238
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:00,406
Sorry, Ted.

239
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:04,066
Great. What am I gonna do
when Robin shows up?

240
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,862
She'll show up.

241
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:08,077
<i>OLDER TED: She didn't show up.</i>

242
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:12,260
All right, we threw two parties,
everybody had fun,

243
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,514
everybody Wang-ed, everybody Chung-ed.

244
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:19,050
Now the kid has got to get to work.
And the kid is not to be disturbed.

245
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:22,323
Repeat after me,
'I will not have sex with Marshall.'

246
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:25,275
- I will not have sex with Marshall.
- I will not have sex with Marshall.

247
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,295
(PHONE RINGING)

248
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,022
It's Robin.

249
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:32,463
- Hello?
- Hi, Ted.

250
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,827
Amanda? Oh, Denise, sorry.
You totally sounded like Amanda.

251
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:38,966
- It's Robin.
- Oh, Robin.

252
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:41,447
<i>- Hi.
- I totally wanted to come.</i>

253
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:44,335
I got stuck at work again.
I feel like I live there.

254
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,196
Sorry I missed your party, again.

255
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,341
<i>Hey, ain't no thing, but a chicken wing,
mamacita.</i>

256
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,360
Who am I?

257
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:55,662
I guess there's no chance your two-dayer
turned into a three-dayer?

258
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:58,004
It did indeed. The party continues tonight.

259
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:00,218
Yeah, last night people were, like,

260
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,914
'Keep it going, bro! Party trifecta!'

261
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,352
Wow, okay. Well, I'll be there.

262
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:07,372
Great. See you tonight.

263
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:12,250
So that was Robin.

264
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:18,541
<i>OLDER TED: So I threw a third party
for Robin, on a Sunday night.</i>

265
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,560
Oh, this is lame.

266
00:12:20,594 --> 00:12:22,967
Lame or casual?

267
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,722
- Lame.
- Or casual?

268
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:30,765
Hey, law books.
Ready for a little 15-minute recess?

269
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:34,488
Sorry, baby, I gotta work.
I need all my blood up here.

270
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:37,184

- No.

WOMAN: Hello, Barney.

274
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:50,337
Of course.

275
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,019
You look well.

276
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:55,682
Is it weird they invited both of us?

277
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:57,701
Who?

278
00:12:57,832 --> 00:13:01,592
Who invited you?
No one even knows who you are.

279
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:06,645
I understand you're hurt,
but you don't have to be cruel.

280
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:09,119
Carlos was right about you.

281
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:11,781
Who is Carlos?

282
00:13:11,886 --> 00:13:13,940

283
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:15,959
Oh!

284
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,002

00:13:25,876 --> 00:13:27,577
is not a coaster!

288
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,267
Ted, I'm jeopardizing my law career
so you can throw not one,

289
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:34,765
not two, but three parties
for some girl that you just met...

290
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:36,594
who's probably not even gonna show up!

291
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:40,368
I mean, where is she, Ted, huh?
Where's Robin?

292
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:43,867
Hi. Hi, Robin.

293
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:55,472
So, you threw all these parties for me?

294
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:58,348
No. Oh, you thought that... No.

295
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,721
Okay, yes. You got me.

296
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,863
One of the reasons I threw these parties
was so that I could introduce you...

297
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,103
to this guy.

298
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:10,317
I figured, you know,
since it didn't work out between us...

299
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:11,890
and now we can just laugh about it.

300
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:12,948
(TITTERING)...

301
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:16,600
- Well, anyway, Robin, this is...
- Carlos.

302
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,203
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

303
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,504
She's still talking to Carlos.

304
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,494
I can still win this. It's not over.

305
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,414
Okay, buddy, time for the tough talk.

306
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:32,046
Robin seems great,
but let's look at the facts.

307
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,553
You want to get married...

308
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,821
and right now there's a million women
in New York looking for exactly you.

309
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,329
But Robin ain't one of them.

310
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,960
She's not just one of them. She's the one.

311
00:14:42,056 --> 00:14:45,817
Yeah well, 'the one'
is heading up to the roof.

312
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:49,816
What are you gonna do?

313
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:53,025
Nothing. It's a game. I gotta just...

314
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:55,049
keep playing it.

315
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:33,557
ROBIN: Hey.
TED: Hey.

316
00:15:33,654 --> 00:15:37,504
<i>- Carlos, can you give us a minute?
- Hey, no sweat, hombre.</i>

317
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,524
See you.

318
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:46,135
Robin, look, I didn't throw this party
to set you up with Carlos...

319
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:49,991
or the one before that,
or the one before that.

320
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:53,629
I threw these parties
because I wanted to see you.

321
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:55,648
Well, here I am.

322
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:59,854
There's something here.
Look, unless I'm crazy.

323
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,873
You're not crazy.

324
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:06,816
I don't know, Ted.
I mean, we barely know each other...

325
00:16:06,912 --> 00:16:09,608
and you're looking at me with that look
and it's like...

326
00:16:09,704 --> 00:16:12,656
- What, like what?
- It's like, 'Let's fall in love,

327
00:16:12,752 --> 00:16:15,930
'and get married and have kids
and drive them to soccer practice.'

328
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:19,876
I'm not gonna force sports on them
unless they're interested.

329
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:23,117
It's a great look,
but you're looking at the wrong girl.

330
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:25,043
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

331
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,513
I don't want to get married right now,
maybe ever.

332
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:30,754
And if we go out together, I'd feel like

333
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,701
I'd either have to marry you
or break your heart...

334
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:37,813
and I just couldn't do either of those things.

335
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,670
Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.

336
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:44,711
Click.

337
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,731
Off. Let's make out.

338
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,113
What?

339
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:51,803
What? That was the off switch
and I turned it off.

340
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,145
I mean, look, sure, yes, I wanna...

341
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:58,029
fall in love, get married, blah, blah, blah.
But, on the other hand,

342
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,587
you, me,

343
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:02,615
the roof.

344
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:07,128
- There's no off switch.
- There is an off switch.

345
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:09,445
And it's off.

346
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,465
No, it's not.

347
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,743
Yes, it is.

348
00:17:13,873 --> 00:17:15,885
- No, it's not.
- Yes,

349
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:18,941
it is.

350
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:29,080
Oh.

351
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:33,862
No, it's not.

352
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:36,934
You're right. There's no off switch.

353
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,517
- God, I wish there was an off switch.
- (EXHALING) Me, too.

354
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:46,435
- God, I wish there was an off switch.
- (EXHALING) Me, too.

355
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:48,878
So...

356
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:51,830
What do we do now?

357
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,002
We could be friends.

358
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:01,734
Look, I know it sounds insincere
when people say that...

359
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,040
but we could.

360
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,514
I don't know, Robin.

361
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:08,183
I made such a jackass of myself here,

362
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,301
we start hanging out,
every time I see you, it'll be like,

363
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:12,676
'Oh, that's right, I'm a jackass.'

364
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:14,695
You're not a jackass.

365
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:19,606
Look, I'm sorry. I only moved here in April,
and I'm always working.

366
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:23,790
And I just haven't met
a lot of good people so far.

367
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:25,990
But I understand.

368
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:28,749
Well,

369
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:32,730
maybe in a few months
after it's not so fresh we could all,

370
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:35,649
you know, get a beer.

371
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:38,623
Yeah. That sounds good.

372
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:42,322
I'll see you, Ted.

373
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:48,772
Or, you know, now.

374
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,625
We could all get a beer now.

375
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,553
I'd like that.

376
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:06,210
My friends are gonna love you, like you,
you know as a friend.

377
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:08,513
Jackass.

378
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,299
Unbelievable.

379
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:15,092
That's just a recipe for disaster.
They work together.

380
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:17,082
- You jealous?
- Oh, please.

381
00:19:17,178 --> 00:19:20,323
- What does Carlos have that I don't?
- A date tonight?

382
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:21,413
(ALL JEERING)

383
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,564
Stop the tape. Rewind, play it again.

384
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,867
(GIBBERING) A date tonight?

385
00:19:26,482 --> 00:19:28,444
I'm not sure I like her.

386
00:19:28,697 --> 00:19:30,205
Hey, don't you have a paper to write?

387
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:32,547
- Dude, you're taIking to the kid.
- I know it.

388
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:36,077
I'm gonna knock back this beer,
I'm gonna knock back one more beer,

389
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:38,933
I'm gonna go home,
I'm gonna write a 25-page paper,

390
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:41,178
I'm gonna hand it in
and I'm gonna get a 'A.'

391
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:44,544
My name is Rufus and that's the Troofus.

392
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:46,120
<i>OLDER TED: He got a B-minus.</i>

393
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:50,965
<i>But, still, 25 pages in one night, B-minus?
The kid was good.</i>

394
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:54,206
At least, let me buy you a beer.
Come on, I'll buy everyone a beer.

395
00:19:54,302 --> 00:19:56,226
I'll help carry.

396
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,779
- You know something, Ted?
- What?

397
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:05,726
You are a catch.
You're gonna make some girl very happy.

398
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:08,581
And I am going to help you find her.

399
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:10,600
Well, good luck.

400
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:12,529
I mean, maybe,
New York is just too big a town.

401
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,550
I mean, there's millions of people
in this city.

402
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,534
How, in all this mess, is a guy
supposed to find the love of his life?

403
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,246
I mean, where do you even begin?

404
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:24,649
Hi, have you met Ted?
