Last season on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,040
Iris isn't Iris-- the real Iris, my wife,

12
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,260
she is somewhere else, probably in danger.

13
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,410
Barry!

14
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,320
You targeted me from the very beginning.

15
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,540
- I saw everything. - As for the other Wellses,

16
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,800
they're as much a part of you as yourself.

17
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,380
You mean I'm gonna keep hearing them?

18
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,360
- Yeah. - I did this.

19
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,710
I killed the Speed Force.

20
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,880
I need your help to build an Artificial Speed Force.

21
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,160
I need my speed back if I'm gonna save Iris.

22
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,130
This whole time when you looked at me,

23
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,770
you saw this other person.

24
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,840
For six years, I've been in my own personal hell.

25
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,810
You let me rot in here while you took everything I created.

26
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,810
Stay out of my way, Flash.

27
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,510
I will be resuming my position as CEO.

28
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,870
My husband, Joseph, he worked tirelessly to try to find me,

29
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,660
only to be murdered moments after we were reunited.

30
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,430
Eva McCulloch has never faced us head-on.

31
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,550
That's about to change.

32
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,070
We're gonna find her, beat her,

33
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,670
and get back everyone.

34
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,850
Yeah, you're right for now, my sister, but what if?

35
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,990
What if the entire universe is just some kind of...

36
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,830
cosmic neural network?

37
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,500
Then what you gonna say?

38
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,840
Oh, okay.

39
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,670
Okay, okay.

40
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,770
You know the drill, Chester P.

41
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,470
Been prepping this for weeks.

42
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,190
Okay, now, that is...

43
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,990
that is not good.

44
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,540
Where's Eva?

45
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,260
Satellites have her at 2nd and Walczak.

46
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,380
Make that 3rd and Certo.

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,960
You doing okay?

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,120
I know the Cryo Pod keeps your residual speed forces stasis,

49
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,390
but waking up can be pretty disorienting.

50
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,500
Call Joe. Tell him I'm heading downtown.

51
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,740
But, Flash, you only have 1% of your speed left.

52
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,730
Then I better hurry.

53
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,060
Eva's coordinates slowed down.

54
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,310
- Maybe she stopped moving? - No.

55
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,770
She's going up.

56
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,480
Why do you keep interrupting my mission, Flash?

57
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,670
I told you,

58
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,670
we're on the same side.

59
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,980
If we're on the same side, then give me back my wife!

60
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,610
My fractal photons move at the speed of light.

61
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,100
You never had a chance.

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,920
I don't want to hurt you.

63
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,500
But I'm cleansing the world of Black Hole's influence,

64
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,300
so you either die,

65
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,310
or you stand down.

66
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,060
Flash, are you okay?

67
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,160
Flash?

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,410
Okay, I picked up Eva at a warehouse on 199th Street.

69
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,190
Suspected hideout of...

70
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,980
Rosa Dillon and Sam Scudder,

71
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,490
AKA...

72
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,030
- Top and Mirror Master. - Yeah.

73
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,570
Mirror, no!

74
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,500
You just killed the man I loved.

75
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,380
He never told you what he really was?

76
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,770
'Cause Sam Scudder wasn't a man.

77
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,610
He was my creation.

78
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,950
My first.

79
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,540
Flash?

80
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,070
Did you make it? Did you stop Eva?

81
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,700
Flash?

82
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,940
Well, that was the best takeout world tour yet.

83
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,760
Coq Au Vin from Paris, sashimi from the Arctic...

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,180
The Kansas State Fair funnel cake was Clark's recommendation.

85
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,280
I just wish I didn't have to go back to work already.

86
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,190
Is anybody still here?

87
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,180
Allegra went home for the day.

88
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,130
And Kamilla,

89
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,570
she is...

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,200
Missing.

91
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,720
I've missed you so much.

92
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,250
No, this isn't right.

93
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,980
This isn't right.

94
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,330
This isn't right.

95
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,930
Barry?

96
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,170
God. I'm still here.

97
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,780
Eva hit nine more spots last night.

98
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,920
I missed her every time.

99
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,430
How much speed do you have left?

100
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,990
A few days.

101
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,930
Maybe a few hours.

102
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,270
Eva's targeting Black Hole tech, right?

103
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,360
So why go after Scudder and Dillon?

104
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,420
They were working for Black Hole.

105
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,090
I found this in Scudder's remains.

106
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,010
I'm guessing they've been on Carver's payroll

107
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,150
since breaking out of Iron Heights last year.

108
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,500
And when they got in Eva's way,

109
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,180
she moved them off the chessboard?

110
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,250
Well... they are not the only ones.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,510
The whole city thinks that Sue killed Carver.

112
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,940
She and Ralph are staying way off the grid.

113
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,300
And Caitlin and Cisco are still gone, too.

114
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,240
And Iris.

115
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,830
I should get back to S.T.A.R. Labs.

116
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,390
If we're gonna stop Eva and fix this,

117
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,860
I need the Artificial Speed Force up and running.

118
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,280
Well, we may not know

119
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,150
where Scudder moved the Black Hole tech,

120
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,320
but I bet you Dillon does.

121
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,630
I'm gonna go in,

122
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,680
see if I can get her to talk to me.

123
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,310
Actually, Captain...

124
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,230
I am.

125
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,360
Right. When you were a prosecutor,

126
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
you put Dillon in Iron Heights.

127
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,240
And now I'm her defense attorney that's gonna keep her out

128
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,660
and get her to tell me where that tech is.

129
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,480
That's my girl.

130
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,060
Connecting Fusion Sphere.

131
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,140
Fusion Sphere connected.

132
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,220
- Activate. - Uh...activated.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,150
Oh, it's working.

134
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,000
Now we just have to find a fuel source to put in it.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,290
And then, we can power the Artificial Speed Force.

136
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,600
Exactly.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,990
What?

138
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,030
One of the sphere plates doesn't look fully magnetized.

139
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,410
Whoa! You can't touch that.

140
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,380
If you touch the Fusion Sphere while it's activated,

141
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,960
the Fusion Sphere thinks you're the fuel source.

142
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,790
Yes. And fuse my atoms,

143
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:59,090
which would lead to a complete molecular degeneration.

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,350
Sorry. I'm just trying to get your speed back.

145
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,110
Don't hurt yourself trying to do it.

146
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,910
I'd never want you to do that.

147
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,570
- Allen. - What?

148
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,840
- Can you get this guy a coffee? Wake him up? - Yes. Let's--

149
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,190
Hey, come on. Let's get a coffee.

150
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,090
Whoa, can I use that cappuccino maker

151
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,760
you guys have in the lounge?

152
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,270
- Knock yourself out. - Yes!

153
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,280
All right.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,190
What? What?

155
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,420
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

156
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,090
So it turns out we cracked the fuel problem

157
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,390
for this A.S.F. of yours.

158
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,910
Pas facile non. Not easy, not great.

159
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,720
But so much fun, huh?

160
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,090
I love all the brainstorming.

161
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,580
Plus, we got all the Wellses back together again.

162
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,780
So I expect I need no introduction,

163
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,070
but, yes, it is I, master of stage and screen,

164
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,850
Harrison Orson Wells.

165
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,940
- Okay, you're new. - Nash, as I know you know,

166
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,740
when our worlds died in Crisis,

167
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,330
particles from our brainwaves were drawn to you like...

168
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,440
Like a moth drawn to a cosmic flame.

169
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,820
Whatever happened to show, don't tell? H.R.?

170
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,380
- Oh, nice catch. - I love this part.

171
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,740
So there are multiversal particles

172
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,410
inside you right now, Nash, made of synaptic energy.

173
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,130
Now, we take those particles

174
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,540
and you put them in the Fusion Sphere,

175
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,850
theoretically, they could power the A.S.F....

176
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,490
forever.

177
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,390
Forever.

178
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,090
Not only would Allen get his speed back,

179
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,800
but I'd be rid of you lot forever.

180
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,850
No, you'd be gone, too,

181
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,800
I mean, because of the whole organic receptor thing. Oof.

182
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,610
- What? - What's he talking about?

183
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,090
Multiversal particles are just--they're very volatile.

184
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,500
Right? And there's no way they'll stay in that sphere

185
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,930
long enough to be charged unless...

186
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,180
unless we have an organic receptor.

187
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,220
The organic receptor...

188
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,420
is me.

189
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,950
For the Flash to run again, Nash Wells must die.

190
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,350
No.

191
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,270
- What? - No way!

192
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,680
- Nash, you're our organic receptor.

193
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,110
You're the only one that can contain us

194
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,880
inside the Fusion Sphere.

195
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,870
By dying?

196
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,660
- By dying, Harry? - Yes.

197
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,520
- How stupid do you think I am? - Come on.

198
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,930
I have a life here now.

199
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,540
I have people that I actually don't hate.

200
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,380
I'm not gonna give all that up so Barry Allen can run fast!

201
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,430
Nash, you're the only one of us that can help Allen.

202
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,370
And I will, Harry, by figuring out another way

203
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,590
to save Allen that doesn't mean I have to commit suicide!

204
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
- Nash! - Where he's going?

205
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,690
Bozos!

206
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,380
Didn't see that coming.

207
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,540
And scene.

208
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,620
What the hell?

209
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,010
Maybe I can message Kamilla.

210
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,100
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

211
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:00,040
My wife died in the particle accelerator explosion!

212
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,390
You're not...

213
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,880
even...

214
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,000
human.

215
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,030
You do not control me anymore, Joseph.

216
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,170
She killed Sam right in front of me.

217
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,670
If you tell me

218
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,800
where you and Scudder were moving that tech,

219
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
I can use that information to strike a deal for you

220
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,340
with the state and...

221
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,310
catch Sam's killer.

222
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,870
I wish I knew, but Sam made all the deals.

223
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,990
That's funny.

224
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,810
Your IHP file says that you were running

225
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,510
a psychotropic drug ring out of the Meta-Wing.

226
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,350
You were flush with cash, and

227
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,980
It's just that you felt so sad

228
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,210
when you were remembering that time.

229
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,200
It's almost as--

230
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,470
almost as if you were deliberately projecting

231
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,960
a fake emotion at me,

232
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,850
but why would you do that?

233
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,220
Why would you do that unless you already knew

234
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,760
that I was an empath?

235
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,370
How would I know that?

236
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,990
I'm not psychic. I just cause vertigo.

237
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,170
What else can you do inside people's minds, Rosa?

238
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,260
Let me show you.

239
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,190
I feel so empty.

240
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,160
What did you do to me?

241
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,140
What did you do to me? What did you do to me?

242
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,720
I found a little kernel of doubt inside of you

243
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,160
and spun, spun, spun it

244
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,070
into a full-blown crisis of confidence...

245
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,240
like a top.

246
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,190
Scudder's ditzy girlfriend?

247
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,960
It was all an act.

248
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,560
I was always the brains.

249
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,180
He was just the pretty face.

250
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,650
Then Sam cut a deal with Black Hole.

251
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,390
We got rich, but we were in over our heads.

252
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,270
So, when I heard Eva McCulloch wanted him dead...

253
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,870
You sold him out to her.

254
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,450
And in return,

255
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,940
Eva gave me a cause to believe in.

256
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,090
She delegated her next mission to me.

257
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,900
And what I've cooked up for her

258
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,920
is gonna blow this city away.

259
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,950
If you are planning something

260
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,650
that will put people in danger--

261
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,810
What?

262
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,390
The Flash is gonna stop me?

263
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,390
He can barely run.

264
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,710
You know, when I first got my powers,

265
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,550
I was an empath, too.

266
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,070
And look what I've grown into.

267
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,850
Who knows what you would've become

268
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,720
if only you weren't so...

269
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,540
afraid?

270
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,840
Guess we'll never know.

271
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,250
Thought you could use a pick-me-up.

272
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,340
Thank you.

273
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,530
"Organic Receptors in Nuclear Physics."

274
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,760
- Yeah. Yeah. - What's an organic receptor?

275
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,730
Ah, no. I'm just, uh...

276
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,090
This is--I'm just helping Barry

277
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,910
get his speed back, or I'm trying to, anyway.

278
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,240
Well, it's nice to see you care about someone

279
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,720
other than me for a change.

280
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,800
Well, you're...

281
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,120
You're the answer.

282
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,730
Multiversal particles

283
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,390
oscillate at certain frequencies of light.

284
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,050
Allegra can control electromagnetic wavelengths.

285
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,770
So she can push the particles out of you

286
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,690
- and into the Fusion Sphere. - Right.

287
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,700
Charging a fuel source for the A.S.F.

288
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,930
And we take all that kinetic energy,

289
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,530
and we just transfer it to the track ring above us--

290
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,400
giving Flash his groove back.

291
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,860
- Uh, just--just one thing. - What?

292
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,590
Aren't multiverse particles a little too chaotic

293
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,110
to be contained in a Fusion Sphere?

294
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,730
Yes, normally they would be, but Allegra can use her powers

295
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,880
to contain the particles inside the Fusion Sphere

296
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,750
from a safe distance.

297
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,950
Hey, thanks for looking out for me,

298
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,510
but if Nash says it's gonna work, I trust him.

299
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,180
Okay.

300
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:43,930
All right, then.

301
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,360
- Ready? - Yeah.

302
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,810
Yeah.

303
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,690
Okay.

304
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,360
The Fusion Sphere is....

305
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,230
- ready for particle insertion. - Okay.

306
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,310
- Good? - Yeah.

307
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,200
Guys...

308
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,710
something's not right.

309
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,170
What's happening?

310
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,370
The charge is dropping.

311
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,070
I can't hold it much longer.

312
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,880
A-Allen?

313
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,150
- Barry, you okay? - Please be okay.

314
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,670
Please be okay.

315
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,290
Hello.

316
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,910
Qu'est ce qui se passe?

317
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,520
What are you all doing?

318
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,790
Uh, since when do you speak French?

319
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,560
- Since always, no? - Why is he talking funny?

320
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,340
I think when the particles left the Fusion Sphere,

321
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,190
they transferred to Barry Allen.

322
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:30,050
So all the brainwaves of all the Wellses who've ever lived...

323
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,080
Are inside monsieur Allen's mind.

324
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,180
Allow me, introduce myself.

325
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,890
I'm Sherloque Wells,

326
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,940
master detective, at your service.

327
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,250
I'm Chester. Chester P. Runk.

328
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,110
- Chester. - Yeah.

329
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,680
- There's a Sherlock Wells? - Sherloque.

330
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,370
Yes, there's a Sherlock Wells.

331
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,450
- Sherloque. - -loque.

332
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,000
- lock. - Sherlock.

333
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,330
- loque. - lock.

334
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,870
- loque. - loque.

335
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,790
Good. Good. No great.

336
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,480
Vite, mes Ami.

337
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,780
We face a mystery stranger

338
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,190
than the King Tut Killer

339
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,890
of Earth-66.

340
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,680
- The Many Minds of Barry Allen. - Oh, man.

341
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,590
All of them ended up inside Barry?

342
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,460
It looks like, but, listen, let's not panic.

343
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,590
Between the three of us and a master detective,

344
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,850
we can figure out how to fix Barry Allen.

345
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,870
You guys talking about B.A.?

346
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,240
He's so fast!

347
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,960
- What just happened to him? - I think another set

348
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,280
of Wells particles just took over his mind.

349
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,950
H.R. Wells. How you guys doing?

350
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,240
Yeah, so this is simple--we just get all the Wellses

351
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,120
out of B.A. Into the Futon Sphere.

352
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,450
It's a--Stop. It's a Fusion Sphere.

353
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,460
Can you stop drumming?

354
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,630
Can you stop drum--okay.

355
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,690
The drumming is so annoying--

356
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,070
Do you hear the drums?

357
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,560
They are coming.

358
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,190
It is I,

359
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,200
Wells the Grey.

360
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:05,210
- Oh, Wells the Grey. - There's a wizard Wells?

361
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,370
This is all my fault.

362
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,310
Oh, my God. Do you know Gandalf?

363
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,180
Barry trusted me to help him, and I screwed up.

364
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,770
No, it's not...

365
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,290
it's not your fault.

366
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,890
Look, here's what we'll do.

367
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,770
Um, just blast him again,

368
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,300
and we'll push the particles back into me.

369
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,980
Uh-uh. No way. I'll just make it worse.

370
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,920
No, you won't make it worse.

371
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,010
All we got to do is figure out a way to contain

372
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,080
the particles once they leave Allen's body, like a magnet--

373
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,980
Guys? Guys?

374
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,930
What are you?

375
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,020
Can't figure it out?

376
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,950
Did you lose your dissertation?

377
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,730
- You're a copy of me. - No. I'm no fractal anomaly.

378
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,200
I am a product of your broken mind.

379
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,410
- That's impossible. - No, it's not.

380
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,600
You pushed your mind to find Singh until it broke...

381
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,830
Forever.

382
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,270
Leave me alone.

383
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,300
There's no escaping this, Iris.

384
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,510
How long have you been trying to get out?

385
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,520
Weeks? Months?

386
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,280
You are weak in every universe--

387
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,870
an insignificant speck,

388
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,440
a victim.

389
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,090
Okay. Okay.

390
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,790
Don't worry. I'm gonna use the Mobile Gideon

391
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,260
to diagnose him.

392
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,520
So, Gideon, what's wrong with Barry?

393
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,230
An abundance of multiversal particles

394
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,180
inside his mind are causing his cerebral cortex to overload.

395
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,420
Yeah, all those brainwaves at once?

396
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,030
It's like when Grodd was trapped in his mind,

397
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,510
but to an infinite degree.

398
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,010
Only Barry Allen's speed healing is keeping him alive now.

399
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,170
Gideon, what happens when his speed runs out?

400
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,120
If the particles remain inside his brain,

401
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,510
Barry Allen will instantly die.

402
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,830
Barry is going to die because of what I did to him.

403
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,480
No. No. I should've trusted my gut.

404
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,220
Look, I knew we needed something else

405
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,680
to keep the sphere intact.

406
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,570
Yeah. That was supposed to be my stupid powers.

407
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,990
No, they're not stupid.

408
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,510
The particles always needed something stronger,

409
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,320
like some sort of...

410
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,760
I don't know, some sort of organic receptor.

411
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:02,070
That's what you were researching in your office.

412
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,680
You let me think I was the only solution,

413
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,750
when this whole time, there was another way?

414
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,050
- No, it's not that simple-- - Yes, it is.

415
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,470
- You lied! - Yes! I lied!

416
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,930
Because I'm the organic receptor.

417
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,790
And I'm not ready to die yet.

418
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,680
Okay, look, Barry wouldn't let anyone die

419
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,790
for the Artificial Speed Force.

420
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,580
Yeah, so why lie about it?

421
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,100
Because I was scared.

422
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,100
I get it.

423
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,170
I thought you had changed.

424
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,520
- Chuck-- - It's Chester P., actually, but--

425
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,970
I need a way to aim the particles

426
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,090
after I push them out of Barry.

427
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,220
Like a particle magnet?

428
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,560
I can build that.

429
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,470
Oh, I mean, I can try.

430
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,890
Lead the way.

431
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,670
What the hell?

432
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,320
Harry--

433
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,090
Look at these brainwave ratings.

434
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,010
Allen's cerebellum is burning up.

435
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,120
Harry, if you want the kid to survive,

436
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,490
- then maybe you better relax-- - I'm fine!

437
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,980
I'm fine. Do not touch me.

438
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,900
What happened to the J.V. Squad?

439
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,450
Why are you moping around here instead of helping them?

440
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,690
Oh, they don't want my help. Right?

441
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,210
Frankly, I don't blame them.

442
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,550
- Garcia found out the truth? - Yeah.

443
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,980
You know what Cisco said after Crisis?

444
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,870
He said, "An infinite number of Harrison Wells,

445
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,040
and we're stuck with the one who killed the Multiverse."

446
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,670
And every day I ask myself, why?

447
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,290
Why am I the one left standing?

448
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,030
So who should've gotten the slot?

449
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,550
One of us bozos?

450
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,520
You're not bozos. I only called you that because

451
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,170
I find the Wells very annoying-- present company excluded.

452
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,840
But you know what you are?

453
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,760
You're a daily reminder

454
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,210
that even though we may all look the same,

455
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,470
we're not the same...

456
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,180
because you're all good men.

457
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,610
And I'm...

458
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,110
I'm not.

459
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,000
So you're a selfish jerk.

460
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,640
You think that I wasn't?

461
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,150
That we all weren't?

462
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,380
Hell, when I met this team, I was working for Zoom.

463
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,780
H.R. Lied.

464
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,930
Sherloque...

465
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,790
kept secrets.

466
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,810
We all came here broken men.

467
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,080
Thanks to Team Flash,

468
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,360
eventually we learned to be better.

469
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,120
That's why I believe in you, Nash.

470
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,890
There's a good man in there somewhere.

471
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,910
You just need to dig him up, let him breathe.

472
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,140
You're not real. You're not real.

473
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,550
- No, I'm not crazy. - Yeah, you are.

474
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,270
And there's only two options in this place--

475
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,680
survival...

476
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,780
Or madness.

477
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,140
No.

478
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,200
This is not neural dissonance.

479
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,020
I'm not seeing you because I'm--

480
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,410
I'm crazy and broken.

481
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,450
This is something else...

482
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,740
someone else.

483
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,900
Keep trying to break me down...

484
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,700
because I am not afraid of the woman that I am today.

485
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,290
But you are...

486
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,430
Eva.

487
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,790
You want me distracted.

488
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,800
I must be getting close...

489
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,730
to finding my way out of here.

490
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,160
You can push yourself until you break,

491
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,490
and you will never escape this world.

492
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,090
I'm sorry, Iris,

493
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:50,630
but if you can't accept my conditions either,

494
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,630
you might never see your husband again.

495
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,180
Wow. You actually came back.

496
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,520
I'm a defense attorney, Rosa.

497
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,780
I can handle a few mind games.

498
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,150
I'm here to get you a deal.

499
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,940
Am I supposed to be intimidated by you now?

500
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,780
The woman who's afraid of her own powers?

501
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:27,060
Maybe you're right, okay? Maybe--maybe I am afraid.

502
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,560
When I first got these abilities,

503
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,430
I was so excited.

504
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,360
But then when my powers-- they started to grow

505
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,060
and change,

506
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,660
and I...

507
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,300
I bottled them up because I was afraid.

508
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,800
I was afraid I was gonna become someone like you.

509
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,260
Are you trying to rile me up?

510
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,760
No, Rosa.

511
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,840
I'm trying to remind myself

512
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,370
of all of that fear

513
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,840
that I have locked down

514
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,700
deep inside...

515
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:14,390
so that I can put it all into you.

516
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,140
My heart...is...racing!

517
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,890
You want to go back to prison?

518
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,390
Or do you want to tell me what you're planning?

519
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,260
Hey. What's wrong?

520
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,860
There's a supersonic jet about to leave

521
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,380
a secret Black Hole site in the Badlands,

522
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,460
and it is loaded with all of Carver's remaining tech.

523
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,940
But that's not the only thing it's carrying.

524
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,480
Rosa Dillon planted a bomb on board.

525
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,260
If it blows over this city, hundreds of people will die.

526
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,090
And the Flash isn't fast enough to stop it.

527
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,930
Okay. Okay. Here, put this on.

528
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,800
Once Allegra pushes the particles outside of Barry,

529
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,150
these ionic circuits will catch them, put them back into you.

530
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,430
- Smart, Runk. - That's brilliant.

531
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,540
Thanks.

532
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,830
Listen, when this is over,

533
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,550
I'll find a way to make this up to you.

534
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,350
This is a pretty good start.

535
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,040
- Ready? - Yeah.

536
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,990
It's working. Keep going.

537
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,040
Barry?

538
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,170
Are you...Barry?

539
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:59,260
Yeah. It's really me.

540
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:01,960
All right, let's celebrate later,

541
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,450
because we still have a supersonic jet

542
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,470
about to explode over the city.

543
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,550
I still can't stop it.

544
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,940
The plane's only three minutes out.

545
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,360
We need a plan.

546
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,460
No.

547
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,410
We need the Flash.

548
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,470
Nash!

549
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,160
- That'll kill you. - I know.

550
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,410
But I'm the organic receptor that we need.

551
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,350
You're getting your speed back.

552
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,800
We'll find another way.

553
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,490
What other way, Allen?

554
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,780
- There's no time. - Nash.

555
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,810
You don't have to do this just to prove a point.

556
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,850
I'm not doing it to prove a point.

557
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm doing it because I won't watch you die.

558
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,100
I won't let any of you die.

559
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,500
Don't! Don't! Don't!

560
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,560
No, no, no, no, no. If you touch him, we'll lose you, too.

561
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,430
Nash, please.

562
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,630
I can't let anyone else die for me.

563
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,110
I've already lost so many people.

564
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,230
Do you know what I feel right now, Allen?

565
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,880
Pride.

566
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,140
Honor.

567
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,260
It's been so long since I felt those things.

568
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,200
And it's not just me.

569
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,010
The Council feels it, too.

570
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,780
And we've made our decision.

571
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,260
We're doing this, Allen.

572
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,770
Is it charging?

573
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,820
Yeah, the Fusion Sphere is charging.

574
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,670
How can I be the Flash without a Wells on this team?

575
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,220
You've always been the Flash.

576
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,600
You always will be...

577
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,130
with or without me.

578
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,420
Hey, B.A.

579
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,470
How's it going?

580
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,760
You're so fast.

581
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,050
No, no, no. B.A., don't be upset.

582
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,410
This is not goodbye. It's just...

583
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,170
till our next communion.

584
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,720
Not great, hmm?

585
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,270
Our current situation, huh? But...

586
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,550
it will be.

587
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,020
Allen...

588
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,220
you know, when I came to your stupid Earth...

589
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,300
With its good burgers...

590
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,500
lost, angry, blah, blah, blah,

591
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,600
and you showed me...

592
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,240
how to be a better person.

593
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,190
And I'll always be grateful for our friendship.

594
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,630
Now...

595
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,070
Run.

596
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,920
Barry...

597
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,870
run.

598
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,600
We're at 80%.

599
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,050
You got this.

600
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,530
After I'm gone...

601
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,150
look out for one another.

602
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,830
A.R.G.U.S. Was waiting for the jet when it landed.

603
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,580
They seized all the Black Hole tech on board.

604
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,600
All thanks to the Flash.

605
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,840
So Nash died a hero.

606
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,890
And I...

607
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,740
I never really got to know him.

608
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,380
Look, I know after tonight that none of us will...

609
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,320
ever be the same.

610
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,220
But we all heard what Nash said.

611
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,550
He was so happy to have you in his life.

612
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,480
Thanks, Chester.

613
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,660
Y-you can call me Chuck.

614
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,030
I need to tell the rest of the team.

615
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,090
I'll call Carla, make sure Caitlin knows.

616
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,070
Cisco's gonna want to come back from his trip.

617
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,840
Harry was like a father to him.

618
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,420
When they were all in my mind, I could...

619
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,570
I could feel their spirits.

620
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
I could feel how much they loved me.

621
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,050
They gave themselves up for me.

622
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,010
How am I supposed to live with that?

623
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,530
Uh, I think that's the point.

624
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,600
You know, they put themselves in the A.S.F.

625
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,260
so you could live...

626
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,550
and thrive.

627
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,500
And now, whenever you run,

628
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:12,050
it'll kind of be like they'll be running with you.

629
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,460
Right?

630
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,210
You know, Nash wasn't

631
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,180
the only one who rose to the occasion today.

632
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:29,510
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you guys.

633
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,810
So...

634
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,030
what now, Flash?

635
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,080
We go save Iris and our friends.

636
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,390
We get everybody back.

637
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,670
Eva, what was that? Are you okay?

638
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,380
Eva?

639
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,930
Help!

640
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,730
Someone help me!

641
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,210
I died.

642
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,580
Everything I thought was a lie.

643
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,390
I'm the mirror duplicate.
