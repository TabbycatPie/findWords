17
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Previously on The Flash...

18
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,600
- Caitlin! - Dad.

19
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,200
I'll always love you.

20
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,750
You took our daughter back to the future?

21
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,570
I can't trust her.

22
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,930
Thawne is manipulating her.

23
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,490
Follow my instructions and we will defeat Cicada,

24
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,760
destroy his dagger,

25
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,880
and save your father.

26
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,820
You created your own Speed Force?

27
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,570
Yes, I did.

28
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,480
And I can access it to go back in time.

29
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,500
- How could he leave me? - Nora--

30
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,060
How could he stop loving me?

31
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,900
- She's gone. - Gone where?

32
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,610
I don't know where.

33
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:32,450
I only know when: 2019.

35
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,950
Gideon, scan servers for blueprints

36
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,720
from McCulloch Technologies.

37
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,430
Gotcha.

38
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,730
Gideon, infiltration analysis.

39
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,180
Yes, Nora West-Allen.

40
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,370
The odds of accessing this location on your own

41
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,640
are 1 in 3 million.

42
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,670
Shall I send a request to Barry Allen?

43
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:13,960
No, Gideon.

44
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,690
I need people who can actually help me.

47
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,170
Tachyon scanners set up

48
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,300
at every half-mile interval across the city.

49
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,580
And the seismometer is searching for sonic booms

50
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,010
in the hundred-megahertz range.

51
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,840
As for the satellites, I've got Carrie, Charlotte,

52
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,940
Miranda, and Samantha scanning

53
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,100
for her yellow-purple lightning signatures.

54
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,120
I am clearly the Samantha of this group, right?

55
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,450
Yeah, okay, Miranda.

56
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,230
So, technically, if Nora uses the Speed Force--

57
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,200
We'll find her.

59
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,270
Kinda thought she'd pop right up.

60
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,660
If she's even here.

61
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,630
How can you guys be so sure

62
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,850
that she even came back from the future in the first place?

63
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,270
Because Thawne sent her.

64
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,860
He showed her a new way to time-travel,

65
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,240
something that can't be detected.

66
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,190
But as soon as she starts running again,

67
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,480
we're gonna be able to bring her home.

68
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,250
Well, Team Flash,

69
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,920
Nora West-Allen is not the only time traveler who's absent.

70
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,140
We've been running down abandoned buildings, foreclosed condos...

71
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,520
Anywhere that Grace Gibbons

72
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,560
may have hidden her younger self, but--

73
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,380
We got bupkis.

74
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,150
And we have no idea why she stole the Cryo-Atomizer,

75
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,830
except that it was worth killing my dad for.

76
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,570
Hey, if you need more time...

77
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,710
Yeah, we're more than capable of chasing

78
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,370
a wild goose or two on our own.

79
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,570
Thank you, I'm fine.

80
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,980
I'd rather be working.

81
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,890
On that note, I'm happy to help you

82
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,620
follow that lead on the atomizer.

83
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,370
Really?

84
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,890
- What about... Sherluck? - Sherloque.

85
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,060
Do you think any of you will get this right at any point

86
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,740
at any time in your life? Sherloque.

87
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,420
No, I'm going to continue

88
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,090
the quest for Nora West-Allen.

89
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,600
I... feel somewhat responsible.

90
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,790
Hey, it's CCPD-- there was a break-in

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,050
at an architecture firm on 34th and Williamson.

92
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,120
Meta-suspect.

93
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,980
Citizens reporting an explosion there.

94
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,380
Sounds like you guys might need an extra set of hands.

95
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,710
I'll grab my gear.

96
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,650
Oh. There's an alert at my dad's old lab in the Arctic.

97
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:19,580
We should check it out.

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,990
Yeah, better wash my long johns.

99
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,550
Yeah.

100
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,480
You gonna get that or...

101
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,220
Yeah, I'm going to get it,

102
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,170
but I know already it's Ren¨¦e Aldler--

103
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,980
- Adler. - Adler.

104
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,080
With these emoticon pictogram things that she send me.

105
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,470
Oh, master detective like you can't decode a few emojis?

106
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,670
I can decode these emojis no problem, huh?

107
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,840
Heart, she like me. Kissy face, want to kiss me.

108
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,090
Peach, eggplant, she like fruit and vegetable.

109
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,050
At this point with the other Ren¨¦e Aldlers,

110
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,320
we are not keeping secrets from one another.

111
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,390
Well, I did it.

112
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,280
Every exercise, every intention,

113
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,190
and now that Kamilla and I are hunky-dory...

114
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,520
You have completed the Book of Ralph.

115
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,010
- I sure did. - Thank you for your service,

116
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,690
old friend, but your job isn't done yet.

117
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,100
Shirley, I think you could use this.

118
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,050
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

119
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,630
What, do you think I need help with a breakup?

120
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,240
Oh, come on. Look, Addendum C...

121
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,540
Appendix four.

122
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,520
A guide to taking your relationship to the next level.

123
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
It worked for Cisco.

124
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,940
Barely worked for young Ralph Macchio.

125
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,010
No, no, no. This guy, he's chicken, right?

126
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,350
Even in his current relationship,

127
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,710
he's too afraid to tell this girl

128
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,940
that he's actually Vibe, right?

129
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,220
I'm actually not afraid.

130
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,230
I'm gonna tell her when I'm ready.

131
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,440
It's just hard to navigate

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,090
the meta-life, personal-life balance.

133
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,930
More like chicken-life balance, hmm?

134
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,270
Man, you're a chicken personal-life balance.

135
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,680
I can tell her whenever I want.

136
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,220
Well, then tell her right now, why don't you?

137
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,100
You want me to tell her right now?

138
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,940
-Yeah. - I'll tell her right now.

139
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,460
I just got--well, you know.

140
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,020
I have spotty reception in the elevator.

141
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,800
Come on out and do it.

142
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,730
Well, you know, I gotta get to work.

143
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,020
- Come on out and do it. - I gotta get to work.

145
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,060
I just talked to one of the architects here,

146
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,440
and G. Simone & Associates

147
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,070
used to do all of this high-profile design work--

148
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,680
casinos, banks, military bases--

149
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,660
but apparently, last year,

150
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,310
they had been working with an anonymous client.

151
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,270
So because our thief covered his tracks,

152
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,210
we have no idea who that client might be.

153
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,590
Look at this.

154
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,980
Look at these hard drives.

155
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,230
Fried from the inside, like in a massive power surge.

156
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,500
A server like this would have a surge protector, right?

157
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,060
A typical metal-oxide varistor

158
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,060
protects against a thousand joules.

159
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,330
How many joules does a lightning bolt have?

160
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,480
A billion.

161
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,780
What, you think this was Nora?

162
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,220
No, this couldn't have been.

163
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,210
I mean, our scanners would've picked her up.

164
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,200
Yeah, about that--

165
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,690
I just picked up a frak-ton of background particle radiation.

166
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,750
Particles? Tachyons?

167
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,820
Negative tachyons.

168
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,610
That's a thing?

169
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,660
I mean, negative tachyons can't generate lightning, right?

170
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,900
Unless negative tachyons

171
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,590
don't just offset positive ones like we thought.

172
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,610
Maybe they actually siphon positive tachyons.

173
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,700
Stealing speed from the Speed Force like a parasite?

174
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,870
That's what Thawne taught her how to do.

175
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,080
She's using negative tachyons to run and avoid our scanners.

176
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,410
Yeah, but why would Nora be trying to avoid us?

177
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,670
I don't know, but if she's stealing blueprints,

178
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,210
this ain't gonna be her last stop.

179
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,390
Pretty paint job.

180
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,810
Predators know these colors get you stung.

181
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,570
Yeah, it's always a great idea

182
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,320
for a thief to draw attention to herself.

183
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,000
At least I don't fly around in a fuzzy green sweater.

184
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,430
Didn't think I'd recognize Weather Wizard's kid?

185
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,900
It's Weather Witch. I have a name, okay?

186
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,000
Bug-Eyed Bandit.

187
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,990
Don't call me that. That's their name.

188
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,140
I heard you took your robot bee act to Star City.

189
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,620
Something about curing a spinal tumor?

190
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,620
Well, I heard you and your other half were in Bolivia.

191
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,530
Or did Silver Ghost ditch you?

192
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,260
Van Zandt talked a big game.

193
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,070
She tried to recruit me too.

194
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,070
What did she want to call us?

195
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,830
Young--

196
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,150
Rag Doll, right?

197
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,120
You blew up the Seaver Building.

198
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,190
Bee-utiful.

199
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:17,010
And whom do I thank for my mysterious invitation?

200
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,410
Wait, I got an anonymous offer too.

201
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,500
This wasn't your job?

202
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,430
I thought this was your job.

203
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,730
Actually, I invited you.

204
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,640
You want us to work for you?

205
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,310
Not for me. With me.

206
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,930
One big score split four ways.

207
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,790
What's the catch, goody two shoes?

208
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,020
No catches, no tricks. Just one condition.

209
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,370
No killing.

210
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,890
Well, this has been really fun, guys, I'm out.

211
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,380
If anybody dies, the cops will be all over us.

212
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,140
Yeah, you would love that, huh?

213
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,470
I was surprised that the Flash isn't already here.

214
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,970
I'm not working with him anymore.

215
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,390
Look, you can put on your leather

216
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,150
and you can act like a bad girl all you want,

217
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,940
but you will never be one of us.

218
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,780
What about the ice patch?

219
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,940
If you don't trust me,

220
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,340
why did you stop that test car from running me over?

221
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,350
Is she for real?

222
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,260
It was cold.

223
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,380
Water freezes.

224
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,860
Not like that, it doesn't.

225
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,180
Look, these past few months, I have been through a lot.

226
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,730
I'm not the same person I was.

227
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,390
Okay. Prove it.

228
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,790
What's the job?

229
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,380
McCulloch Technologies.

230
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,730
It's the largest manufacturer

231
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:38,040
of military-grade weapons in the country.

232
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,880
So why does a speedster need our help

233
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,630
to pull off a smash-and-grab?

234
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,710
McCulloch builds and tests all of their weapons here.

235
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,920
The Forge.

236
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,650
And it's protected by a meta-human dampener

237
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,000
that makes A.R.G.U.S.' look like a bug zapper.

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,850
So, you need us for our tech, because it won't be affected.

239
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,740
McCulloch's hosting an expo tonight.

240
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,580
That'll give us cover to get on the property,

241
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,780
but breaking into the Forge is where things get tricky.

242
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,010
There's no way this score is worth the risk.

243
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,330
Look. See these weapons?

244
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,070
There's a hundred more like these inside.

245
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,980
Each will go for a million on the black market, easy.

246
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,170
We just need to make one quick pit stop first.

247
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,290
We need to rob the Flash.

248
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,980
Okay, pretty safe bet She-Cada was here.

249
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,750
Better check it out.

250
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,920
See if we can figure out what she took.

251
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,530
Yeah, that is if I can get my fingers to start moving again.

252
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,640
You think there's any chance Frost could help us out

253
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,380
with some sealant up there?

254
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,510
I don't think she's coming out today.

255
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,810
She still having a tough time with your dad's death?

256
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,260
I mean, Frost protected me for so long

257
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,090
that I don't think she's ever felt pain of her own before,

258
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,050
not like this.

259
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,620
Well, I-I think I could help with that.

260
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,350
Here.

261
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,980
"Ralph's 27 Steps to a Better Mourning"?

262
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,090
I don't think Frost would respond very well to a pamphlet.

263
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,490
Oh, come on. Look.

264
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,960
Uh, number 10: go see your dentist

265
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,750
because you should be doing that at least twice a year

266
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,640
and you've been slacking,

267
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,540
and it'll give you something to do other than dwell on the pain.

268
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,880
There. Now will you shut up?

269
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,230
Told you I'd get her to come out.

270
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,840
Guess what?

271
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,190
G. Simone & Associates has spent the last year

272
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,620
working for McCulloch Technologies.

273
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,000
The weapons manufacturer?

274
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,390
They just built a factory in Keystone.

275
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,810
Missing blueprints. Top-secret facility.

276
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,580
I think we might have a heist on our hands.

277
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,490
You think Nora's going after these weapons?

278
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,440
No, maybe she's just trying to get them off the market.

279
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,230
You know, like the time that Barry and Ralph

280
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,800
were gonna buy the Toastmasters.

281
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,430
She's on a mission for Thawne.

282
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,020
He doesn't think that small.

283
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,710
Hey, Barry is scanning for negative tachyons.

284
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,730
Why don't you and I dig

285
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,980
into what kind of weapons McCulloch is making?

286
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,770
I know this whistleblower down at the DOD.

287
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,510
Maybe she could offer some insight.

288
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,760
Iris, are you sure there isn't anything else

289
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,350
you'd like to talk about?

290
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,440
Look.... when I saw Nora in 2049,

291
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,300
she was so upset and so angry,

292
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,750
but she knew that I wanted to bring her back.

293
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,270
Then she comes back to this time

294
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,120
and--and she doesn't even come home?

295
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,350
I mean, even if she's mad at Barry

296
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,920
or she wanted some kind of sci-fi weapon--

297
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,650
Then why didn't she just come to the rest of us for help?

298
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,040
There's gotta be a good reason.

299
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,490
I know it.

300
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,370
Come on, Nora.

301
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,840
She's avoiding us. She's stealing blueprints.

302
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,630
I mean, she could really get into trouble out there.

303
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,020
But you think she'll return if you do find her?

304
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,620
After all, she has good reason to be angry at all of us.

305
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,950
Uh, what? Don't lump me in with you two.

306
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,350
I was pissed. She was pissed.

307
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,730
But we've both had time to... get over it,

308
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,870
and she's still Nora.

309
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,350
If I tell her she can come home again,

310
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,690
I'm sure she'll stop working with Thawne.

312
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,580
Is that Nora?

313
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,470
It has to be.

314
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,060
She's in the Starchives.

315
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,230
Nora.

316
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:34,840
Hi, Dad.

317
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,850
Hey, where you going?

318
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Nora is my responsibility as well.

319
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,250
I must speak with her.

320
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:43,950
Hey, hold that!

321
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,520
One of our motion sensors just got tripped in the sewage system.

322
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,230
Sewage system?

323
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,300
Mais non. Nobody could fit down there.

324
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,240
Is that Spencer Young's phone?

325
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,100
What are you doing?

326
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,370
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

327
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,260
Nora...

328
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,120
I shouldn't have left things the way that I did.

329
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,060
All right?

330
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,740
I want you to come home.

331
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,300
We all do.

332
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,310
You just have to stop working with Thawne.

333
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,240
Target acquired.

334
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,060
Copy that.

335
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,810
Are you talking to someone?

336
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,460
What do you think, I'm talking to Thawne?

337
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,550
He's in the future, Dad. I can't exactly call him up.

338
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,270
I didn't say that.

339
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,820
Yeah, but you did say that I couldn't come home

340
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,460
if I was still working with him.

341
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,280
- You still don't trust me. - Nora, trust takes time.

342
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,660
Then what's to stop you from sending me back

343
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,380
the next time you get pissed at me?

344
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,050
Nothing.

345
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,150
Because you've given up on me again.

346
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,570
Given up on me like you do every time!

347
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,130
Nora, what are you doing?

348
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,470
You know, I came back here to meet you.

349
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,710
And the second I got here, you started pushing me away.

350
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,010
And then you left me in the future.

351
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,200
You just dumped me in the middle of the street

352
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,220
and walked away!

353
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,980
You have to stop.

354
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,260
And you didn't come with Mom to bring me back.

355
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,150
Because you don't want me here. You don't want me at all!

356
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,830
- Nora, please! - I hate you!

357
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,230
Nora broke into the Starchives.

358
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm sorry, what happened?

359
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,600
Nora broke into the Starchives.

360
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,540
I thought I could stop her, but I couldn't.

361
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,080
She stole Spencer Young's phone.

362
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,360
Spencer Young's hypnotizing phone?

363
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,970
- Yes. - Barry, it's okay.

364
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,670
Did you at least find out what she's doing?

365
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,820
No, no. I tried.

366
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,680
I-I thought I could convince her to come home.

367
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,490
But...

368
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,370
her face started vibrating, and...

369
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,630
and then her eyes...

370
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,310
her lightning...

371
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:14,690
it was red.

372
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,940
Just like his.

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,210
I thought we had time to reach her,

374
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:19,980
but he got to her.

375
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,920
Thawne really got to her.

376
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,240
Uh, guys,

378
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,230
there's a blinky red light thing on the computer.

379
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,270
Another alarm went off at S.T.A.R. Labs.

380
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,740
Guys, this was only five minutes ago.

381
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,870
Joss Jackam and Peter Merkel?

382
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,330
How would they get into S.T.A.R. Labs?

383
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,730
Nora had someone in her ear.

384
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,000
It was a coordinated assault.

385
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,080
But that would mean that she's working...

386
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,170
with them.

387
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,200
Barium.

388
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,430
We're in Keystone City.

389
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,590
Well, we got a Rag Doll,

390
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,470
a Weather Witch, and, uh...

391
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,380
hold up, is that crazy bee girl?

392
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,980
Hey, girl! What's going on?

393
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,320
What a throwback.

394
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,760
What the hell is he doing here?

395
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,570
What the hell are you doing here?

396
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,620
Oh, no.

397
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,710
She's with them.

398
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,460
I said I wanted Ramon. No one else.

399
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,520
Yeah, well, they were together,

400
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,850
and you said no killing, so here they are.

401
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,780
Killing?

402
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,010
This phone was synced to Spencer Young's DNA.

403
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,860
We need you to hack past the coding so we're able to use it.

404
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,850
Why are you laughing?

405
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,330
I'm sorry, I don't mean to blow up your spot, fangirl,

406
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,850
you see, it's just, um...

407
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,120
I've done this exact same thing before.

408
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,300
We need to hack a weapon. Let's kidnap Cisco.

409
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,670
I mean, what, did you join a Rogues cover band or something?

410
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,550
How's this for a cover band?

411
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,990
Oldie but a goodie.

412
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,430
Look, XS, I owe you an apology, hmm?

413
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,580
Never should've exposed your secret the way I did.

414
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,640
I put my pride in front of the family that took me in--

415
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,400
your family-- and your family loves you.

416
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,050
I'm sure you heard.

417
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,430
Your father told you as much today, right?

418
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,940
You saw your father?

419
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,410
You said you were robbing the Flash.

420
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,630
No. No, don't you get it?

421
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,270
Her old man is the Flash.

422
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,810
Look, you don't have to worry about the Flash, okay?

423
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,920
Just get Ramon started on that phone.

424
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,990
Boot scuff marks.

425
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,200
I'm thinking she hit this thing.

426
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

427
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,410
Intravenous electrolytes.

428
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:48,150
I mean, those can be used to treat coma patients.

429
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,050
So maybe she grabbed them for Grace Junior.

430
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,720
Hell, yeah.

431
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,430
I knew your "Grey's Anatomy" Thing would come in handy.

432
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,160
Ralph, why did you really bring me here?

433
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,140
Was it to help Killer Frost and me?

434
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,000
The same way you helped Cisco get over Gypsy

435
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,180
and Sherloque with Ren¨¦e?

436
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,920
What are you talking about? I mean, we're a team.

437
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,070
It's what we do. We help each other.

438
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,270
Yeah, but the minute you got the Book of Ralph back from Cisco,

439
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,860
you tried to give it away again.

440
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,440
Don't you want to use it?

441
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,910
Try and find someone special for yourself?

442
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,020
Caitlin...

443
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,960
look...

444
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Book of Ralph...

445
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,930
works great for other people, but...

446
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,280
never actually worked for me.

447
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,320
I know I'm not...

448
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,110
built for love.

449
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,830
And that's okay.

450
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,510
Ralph Dibny, you are kind, intelligent, and compassionate.

451
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,590
And most of all,

452
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,360
you put the needs of others before yourself.

453
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,660
So that means you are built for love,

454
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,310
and you deserve someone who loves you back.

455
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,550
Caitlin...

456
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,500
I'm sorry, I just don't feel that way about you.

457
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,360
Ugh. Gross!

458
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,960
Oh, come on, you idiot.

459
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,800
Sorry, I got my-- I got my wires crossed.

460
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,420
Jeez.

461
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:24,750
Hey...

462
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,740
I think this might be the fridge

463
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,250
that Cisco was telling me about,

464
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,550
the one that he rewired as an incubator.

465
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,340
And now the top shelf is empty.

466
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,370
Okay, what was on the top shelf?

467
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,220
Cisco's prototypes for the meta-human cure.

468
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
I think I know what Cicada is planning.

469
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,100
Last time a group of women had me tied up like this--

470
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,130
They were your ex-wives?

471
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,890
No, their attorneys, actually.

472
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,680
Am I gonna end up like you?

473
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,390
Married to the job?

474
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,400
Keeping secrets from everyone I know?

475
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,190
Well, actually, in my current romance,

476
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,770
I'm not the one keeping secrets.

477
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,550
No, no, I meet Ren¨¦e Aldler--

478
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,030
- Adler-- - And then I discover...

479
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,380
she's a meta-human.

480
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,180
And she hasn't told you yet?

481
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,130
No, monsieur. Can you believe that?

482
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,970
So if you know the truth, and you're bottling it in,

483
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,890
doesn't that mean you're kind of being dishonest?

484
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,070
Chicken recognize chicken.

485
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,810
And yet, are you really a chicken...

486
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,330
Monsieur Bawk?

487
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,760
Or are you not sharing your secret identity with Kamala--

488
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,420
- Kamilla. - Because...

489
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,270
you're not super-satisfied with your secret identity?

490
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,920
Are you saying I don't want to be Vibe?

491
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,700
Well, let's examine the evidence, shall we?

492
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,760
You spent this past year sans powers for the first part,

493
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,330
and the second part curing powers.

494
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,350
Perhaps being honest with Kamala...

495
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,250
Kamilla.

496
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,110
Begins with being honest with yourself.

497
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,280
Think about that.

498
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,750
So what we know is that Nora put together a team

499
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,420
to break into here, McCulloch Technologies,

500
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,810
a weapons manufacturer.

501
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,450
But not just any weapons.

502
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,820
The city has contracted these guys

503
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,090
to clean up the shrapnel from the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite.

504
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,720
Let me guess: none of that crap ended up in the dump.

505
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,210
They used it to make meta-tech

506
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,880
like Spencer Young's phone.

507
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,460
My source says that McCulloch is debuting

508
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,190
a new line of products tonight.

509
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,450
That's a perfect cover-up for a break-in.

510
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,180
We have any theory on Nora's motive?

511
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,850
Actually, Cicada's dagger dampens the abilities

512
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,270
of meta-humans nearby,

513
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,620
but it wouldn't have any effect on meta-tech.

514
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,360
So maybe Nora wants to catch Cicada?

515
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,820
Or do something worse.

516
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,390
Barry, there's no way.

517
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,330
This is exactly what I was afraid of, Iris.

518
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,000
Thawne's been manipulating her.

519
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,480
Now she's acting like him, talking like him.

520
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,700
That doesn't mean that she's capable of killing Cicada.

521
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,240
She's working with Rogues.

522
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,810
She kidnapped Cisco and Sherloque.

523
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,890
We don't know what she's capable of.

524
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,910
So what do you want to do, Barr?

525
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,990
We bring her in.

526
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,840
We use Cisco's force fields,Ray's nanites--

527
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,780
we're bringing her in,

528
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,630
before she steps anywhere near that building.

529
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,890
Hey, Barry. Hold on.

530
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,290
We can't keep treating Nora

531
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,790
like she's some kind of super-villain, okay?

532
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,820
We're just gonna push her away.

533
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,740
What are we supposed to do?

534
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,610
Just let her keep taking advantage of us?

535
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,820
No. We see where she's coming from.

536
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,390
We try to figure out why she's doing this.

537
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,340
It doesn't matter why, Iris!

538
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,640
This is Thawne.

539
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,980
It's his plan.

540
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,120
Well, maybe his plan isn't so bad.

541
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,570
What?

542
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,530
Maybe--

543
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,690
I thought--

544
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,680
I thought we were past this, it's--

545
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,510
it's not okay for her to work with Thawne.

546
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,970
You saw him. You said he's manipulating her.

547
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,570
And I said that he cares about her.

548
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,690
He's worried about her safety--

549
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,120
No, he needs her, Iris. He needs her.

550
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,520
Or... he's changed.

551
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:02,110
Barry, Thawne is the one that convinced me

552
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,070
to come back home and try and patch things up with you.

553
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,640
Thawne.

554
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,610
Thawne gave you advice?

555
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,110
Look, I know it sounds insane,

556
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,610
and I know this must be hard for you to hear,

557
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,390
but, Barry, ever since I got back home,

558
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,980
the same question keeps running through my mind.

559
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,690
What if Nora is right?

560
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,860
What if Thawne really is trying to redeem himself

561
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,500
and that he does want to stop Cicada

562
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,220
and the only reason that Nora hasn't come back home

563
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,890
is because she knows that you don't trust her?

564
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,020
Look...

565
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,030
Barry, having Nora in our lives

566
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,920
has made us better people.

567
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,100
Isn't it possible

568
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,840
that she did the same thing to Thawne?

570
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,200
Jenni Ognats?

571
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
I thought the idea was to not draw attention.

572
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,770
Oh, what, so now that you know my dad's the Flash,

573
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:10,750
you don't trust me?

574
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,490
Hey, you're the one who doesn't trust us.

575
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,240
Isn't that right...

576
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,730
Nora?

577
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,160
Yeah, your secret identity, it's really not worth much.

578
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,310
Feels like nothing about me is worth much lately.

579
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,060
My dad left me,

580
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,780
after everything that I've done to try and help him.

581
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,060
You know what the most embarrassing part is?

582
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,710
There's this tiny, little, weak part of me

583
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,050
that still wants him to walk through that door

584
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,170
and take me home.

585
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,090
My dad left my mom at the maternity ward.

586
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,150
She couldn't look at me without seeing him.

587
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,940
She made sure I knew it too.

588
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,120
So the day I turned 13, I ran.

589
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,970
I didn't leave town at first.

590
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,250
I stayed under the overpass with all the other runaways.

591
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,260
And I thought for sure,

592
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,900
one night, I'd look up

593
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,710
and I'd see my mom.

594
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,000
She never showed.

595
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,360
- Sorry. - I'm not.

596
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,140
When people tell you that

597
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,690
family is always gonna be there for you,

598
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,330
they're full of it.

599
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,360
Mentors will always let you down eventually.

600
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,530
Parents will break you.

601
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,450
Yeah.

602
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,800
That's why we have to stick together.

603
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,470
- Yeah. - Hey, it's done.

604
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,620
Come on. Nerd's done with the phone.

605
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,150
One reprogrammed meta-tech phone,

606
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,390
now with visual and auditory hypnosis capabilities.

607
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,900
Plus unlimited data.

608
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,210
You gonna let us go now?

609
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:15,110
What, so you can run right back to the Flash?

610
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,720
How stupid do you think I am?

611
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,590
Any bugs in there?

612
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,230
- It's clean. - Good.

613
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,290
Now make sure they can't try anything else.

615
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,730
Come on.

616
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,600
This score's not gonna steal itself.

617
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:49,470
You're not gonna get away with this.

618
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,330
I'm not gonna get away with it?

619
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,610
Cisco's old speedster trap.

620
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,740
You think that's gonna work for Nora?

621
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,580
I don't know.

622
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,110
I'm not sure I'm ready to find out, though.

623
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,200
Hey, look, I'm sorry about, um...

624
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,090
how I was acting earlier, I just...

625
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,190
seeing Nora looking so much like him...

626
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,270
No, I get it, Barr.

627
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,000
That guy's always gonna be in your head.

628
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,190
Mine too.

629
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,180
And you were right.

630
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,900
Nora broke the law.

631
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,470
And there should be repercussions for that.

632
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,820
But whenever you guys step out of bounds,

633
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,430
I always have to remind myself,

634
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,460
the detective side says there's the law.

635
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,770
But the father side says there's also what's right.

636
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:41,410
And... I'm always gonna choose to be your father first.

637
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,300
Maybe that's my problem.

638
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,430
What?

639
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,330
I was ready to give up on her.

640
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,530
You know, I mean, If I'm ready to do that,

641
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,420
it makes me feel like...

642
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,200
even after everything we've been through,

643
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,020
I'm not a good parent.

644
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,290
You know, I mean, maybe I never will be.

645
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,530
Come on, Barry. You know that's not true.

646
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,040
You're going to be an amazing father.

647
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,600
I wanted her to leave.

648
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,060
The second that she got here, I did, I...

649
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,990
I've held back from her.

650
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,240
It still doesn't feel right when she calls me Dad.

651
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,180
Well, you didn't call me Dad till--

652
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,980
it was here, in this room,

653
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,530
right after you got your powers.

654
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,940
But you know why that was.

655
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,270
You already had a dad. Henry.

656
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,730
And when the whole world thought that

657
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,630
that man was a criminal, Barr, you...

658
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,820
You thought he was perfect.

659
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,240
Do you think Iris is right?

660
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,990
Nora's plan, Thawne's plan...

661
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,850
could be a good thing?

662
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,990
I don't trust that man.

663
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,480
I never have and I never will.

664
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,240
But I do...

665
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,310
trust my granddaughter.

666
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,700
And if we're gonna bring Nora home, Barr...

667
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,400
you're gonna have to trust her too.

668
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,560
Oh, thank Crom.

669
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,290
I might've given you unlimited data,

670
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,780
but I also gave you spotty reception.

671
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,590
Nice work.

672
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,060
All right. The bees are in drone mode.

673
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,050
So if we move very, very slowly--

674
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,430
Man, what in the world?

675
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,220
What?

676
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,860
I was trained in the art of escape

677
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,810
by Thaddeus Brown from Earth-51.

678
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,390
Yeah, well, help me escape!

679
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,540
That's a good plan.

680
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,340
So, um...

681
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,810
- Count backwards from ten. - Ten--

682
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,730
How did you do that?

683
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,320
- Trade secret. - Okay.

684
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:53,690
So...

685
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,130
You're not fireproof, are you, Monsieur Ramon?

686
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,000
Am I fire-- oh, God.

687
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,540
No, no.

688
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,540
That's all of them?

689
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,220
- I think so. - Good.

690
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,350
Because Nora West-Allen is in grave danger.

691
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,480
Thank you for your patience, ladies and gentlemen.

692
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,240
With the kind of technology we're displaying tonight,

693
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,640
security is our highest priority.

694
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,530
Visitor IDs, please.

695
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,480
You bet.

699
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,570
Okay, here we go. Right this way, ladies.

700
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,240
The last ten months have been

701
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,490
very exciting here at McCulloch.

702
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:57,110
Buyers from the Army and Navy are already waiting for us

703
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,780
in our state-of-the-art demo room.

704
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,370
Uh, what's behind that door?

705
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,330
That's what our engineers have dubbed the Forge.

706
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,870
It's where we develop and test our new weapons.

707
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,410
Unfortunately, it's only accessible to employees

708
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,460
with the highest security clearance.

709
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,520
Remember.

710
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,890
No killing.

711
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,750
That's a Montgomery 4000, 30-ton vault door.

712
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,030
It'll only open from the inside,

713
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,450
so the only way into the Forge is through there.

714
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,300
Mm, cozy.

715
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,310
Ready, clown?

716
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,240
Are you sure you can fit through that thing?

717
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,770
This shall be my aria.

718
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,120
Remember, once you get to the other side,

719
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,800
the dampener will take away your powers,

720
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,940
so get out quick.

721
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,010
Yeah, I'm gonna vomit.

722
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,690
Open, sesame.

723
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,930
Stay with the hostages.

724
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,490
We'll grab you on the way out.

725
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,940
See you soon.

727
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,700
That's one serious meta-dampener.

728
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,730
Last part of the plan.

729
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,120
Load up.

730
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,570
Sorry, XS.

731
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,100
Change of plans.

732
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,420
Good evening, Central City.

733
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:41,030
We've prepared a special show for you.

734
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,180
Tonight's festivities

735
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,690
will feature several expendable worker bees--

736
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,430
the employees of McCulloch Technologies.

737
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,480
Unless the Flash comes down here in the next 30 seconds

738
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,550
and reveals his identity to the world.

739
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,490
Gucci?

740
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,710
You don't want the money?

741
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,770
Oh, no. We want the money.

742
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,170
We just wanted to make a name for ourselves first.

743
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,130
So, what, outing my dad makes you legitimate Rogues?

744
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,690
I trusted you.

745
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,690
Oh, God.

746
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,960
You sound just like Silver Ghost...

747
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,060
when I left her in Bolivia.

748
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,280
At least you'll die fast.

749
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,200
I'd say it's been about 30 seconds, right?

750
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,480
- Yeah. - Right?

751
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,050
Okay.

752
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,400
Wait!

753
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,890
I am here.

754
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,340
All right, Speedy.

755
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,180
Show us your true identity. Mask off.

756
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,750
Dad, please. You do not have to do this.

757
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,670
I have to.

758
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,370
I am a man

759
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,780
sitting alone at the dinner table.

760
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:49,910
Is he drunk?

761
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,080
See, when you're in position

762
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,660
to feed the world,

763
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,520
it can make it hard to be a father.

764
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,640
You have to constantly ask yourself,

765
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,060
is what's right for the world

766
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,790
what's right for your child?

767
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:06,070
Hey, can we get on with it?

768
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,420
Yes, um... yeah, uh...

769
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,960
- No. - What?

770
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,890
Did you seriously think

771
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,390
I was gonna fall for this again?

772
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,620
I phase right through your blast.

773
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,270
Ha! You can't stop the Flash!

774
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,200
No, I think the jig is up.

775
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,700
Confused?

776
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,040
Don't be.

777
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,130
Holy shrap.

778
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,770
How the hell is this even possible?

779
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,390
We bypassed security while you were busy with General Cloud.

780
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,740
And then you walked us worker bees right inside.

781
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:43,350
You're outnumbered, ladies. Drop your weapons.

782
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,940
Don't let them hit that dampener.

783
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,930
Get the hostages out of here.

784
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,110
We'll handle the Rogues.

785
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,650
Okay, this way.

786
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,730
- We gotta get back in there. - Yeah.

787
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,160
What the hell is that?

788
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,970
You don't want to know.

789
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,580
Cisco, we need our powers back.

790
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,980
Can you do something about these bees?

791
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,790
Hold tight.

792
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,290
Iris!

793
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,720
All right, we're not gonna last here much longer.

794
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,780
I'm gonna create a diversion.

795
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,850
Get ready to shoot the dampener.

796
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,780
No, no. Dad, it's too dangerous!

797
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,550
Dad!

798
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,780
He's lucky I don't throw his ass off a roof.

799
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,930
Nobody out-techs me.

801
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,600
Damn it. Ramon's in my phone.

802
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,460
She's not getting out of this one alive.

803
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,650
Nora, wait!

804
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,540
Dad! You've been hit.

805
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,160
Are you okay?

806
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,590
Yeah.

807
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,210
I'm not the only one.

808
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,650
You were here with me.

809
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,170
The whole time.

810
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,750
I abandoned you once.

811
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,290
I'm never gonna do it again.

812
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,700
So we should probably...

813
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,650
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

817
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,090
The young Rogues.

818
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,790
Not the nicest friends you made there, kiddo.

819
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,090
Yeah, I... thought I could control them,

820
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,460
steal the weapons back after we lifted them,

821
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,010
but I got in over my head.

822
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,790
Even if it was for a good reason.

823
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,290
Nora, killing Cicada is not a good reason.

824
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,160
No, I-I wasn't trying to kill Cicada.

825
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,300
I needed this.

826
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,420
It's a weapon built from the solar reflector panels

827
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,300
from the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite,

828
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,320
capable of destroying any object down to its atoms,

829
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,160
and it's the only thing that can destroy Cicada's dagger.

830
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,780
Nora, why didn't you just tell us this?

831
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,550
Because I wouldn't have believed her.

832
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,910
'Cause it's Thawne's plan.

833
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,480
I knew how angry Dad was.

834
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:59,180
And then you came to the future without him.

835
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,120
I just thought he'd never believe me.

836
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,490
Plus, I had to stay in a seriously unschway headspace

837
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,680
to use the negative Speed Force.

838
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,410
But I know now.

839
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,300
I don't ever want to leave you guys again.

840
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:16,840
And if that means not following through with Thawne's plan,

841
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,070
I'm okay with that.

842
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,520
I think we should use it.

843
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,760
You what?

844
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,170
Barr, are you sure?

845
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,430
We have to stop Cicada.

846
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,140
I'm never gonna like where this plan comes from.

847
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,210
But if this thing works...

848
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,110
sounds like our best shot.

849
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,200
You really believe him?

850
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,130
I believe in you, Nora.

851
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,910
And I'm sorry that I made you feel otherwise.

852
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,590
Dad...

853
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,500
that stuff I said earlier--

854
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,470
I deserved it.

855
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,080
I-I...

856
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,710
I shouldn't have left you in the future.

857
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,990
I shouldn't have put conditions on you coming home.

858
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,890
I'm sorry.

859
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,950
I love you.

860
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,150
We both do.

861
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,560
We're never gonna leave you again, Nora.

862
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,420
I promise.

863
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,990
So what's the verdict?

864
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,450
Nora's story checks out.

865
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,690
This thing has got a prismatic battery

866
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,810
supercharging its reflector panels.

867
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,180
So if anything's gonna destroy that dagger,

868
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,750
it's this mirror gun.

869
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,060
That may be easier said than done.

870
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,820
Why's that?

871
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,100
We figured out what Cicada took from my dad's lab.

872
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,010
It's your cure prototypes.

873
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,490
Why would she need those? They're just prototypes.

874
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,910
No, they're not just prototypes.

875
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,060
They're failed, broken versions of the cure.

876
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,680
If a meta-human takes that without the proper treatment--

877
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,710
They would die.

878
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,960
Cicada has a lethal virus on her hands.

879
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,550
That's why she stole the atomizer.

880
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,980
So she can spread the virus.

881
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,710
She has weaponized the cure.

882
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,310
This is it.

883
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,080
This is the nightmare.

884
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:13,170
Cicada's gonna kill every meta-human in the city.

886
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,630
A rare, old bird is the pelican,

887
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,020
whose beak can hold more than his belly can.

888
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,830
He can hold in his beak

889
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,260
enough food for a week.

890
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,380
But I'm darned

891
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,450
if I know

892
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:53,980
how the hell he can.
