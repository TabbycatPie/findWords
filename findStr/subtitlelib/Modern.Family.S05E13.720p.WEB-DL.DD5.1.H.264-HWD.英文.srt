1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:03,710
Hi, there.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,050
I'll be your server for tonight.

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,990
My name is Brian if you guys need anything.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,100
What's your name if we don't need anything?

5
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,210
Patricia.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,740
You're quick, Patricia!

7
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,680
Thanks. So, our specialty cocktail for tonight

8
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,470
is a basil-infused mojito.

9
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,480
Oh, yum! We'll take three.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,140
Uh, no. That's okay. I'm good.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,060
Come on, now. Join us for a specialty cocktail

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,800
- on our specialty evening. - Yeah.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,570
- Three, please. - Okay.

14
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,290
If you don't drink it, someone will.

15
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,160
Well, that Brian sure is a cutie, huh?

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,640
I'd kill to have those lips. I mean on me.

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,440
I mean I want his lips on my mouth.

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,100
Uh, can we just cut to the chase?

19
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,700
He's got great lips.

20
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,160
No, no, no, no, no. What are we doing here?

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,280
What is this about?

22
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,890
Nothing! We just wanted to have a fun night out

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,720
with our daughter.

24
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,250
Yeah! Just think of us as your friends.

25
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,570
- Yeah! - I don't have 45-year-old friends.

26
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,980
Well, you don't have 45-year-old parents yet, either, honey,

27
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,150
so calm down.

28
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,080
Haley has no plan for her future whatsoever.

29
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,420
She's living in our basement,

30
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,650
taking community-college classes, and, well, meandering.

31
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,320
So we're gonna take her out. We'll have some fun.

32
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,030
And then gently ease her

33
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,060
into a friendly conversationabout her future.

34
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,570
As opposed to the approach that we've taken in the past.

35
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,370
Is this what you're gonna do with your life --

36
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,050
Sleep late and take a selfie?!

37
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,770
Why are you always criticizing me?!

38
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,390
Is this really how you want to start the day?!

39
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,900
My day started 5 hours ago.

40
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,540
I am under a lot of pressure!

41
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,570
How?! How?! You take three classes a week,

42
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,630
and you miss half of them!

43
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,500
The parking is tricky!

44
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,290
Morning, sunshine. I saved you some lunch.

45
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,320
I get it, okay?! I'm lazy! God!

You know what drives me crazy?

51
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,370
Getting these customer-satisfaction calls during dinner.

52
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,530
They change the oil on your car,

53
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,380
they want a love letter!

54
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,000
I know. I'm waiting for a call from my doctor's office --

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,040
"Please rate your prostate exam.

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,080
Would you say you were satisfied?"

57
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,470
I hope you weren't.

58
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,460
"I hope you weren't."

59
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,750
That's a good one, Gloria!

60
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,930
Do you know how hard it is

61
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,490
to be funny in a second language, Jay?

62
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,950
Esta Hermosa Dama es muy buena.

63
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,250
Ay, Darlene, you're learning Spanish?

64
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,860
Yes, Shorty and I have been taking classes.

65
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,350
- We're getting good. - Oh, yeah.

66
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,000
I es maravilloso!

67
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,610
You said "That's wonderful," right?

68
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,930
My Italian helps me.

69
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,700
Why the sudden interest in Spanish?

70
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,550
Well, actually, there's something we have to tell you,

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,830
you know? All right. How's this? We're-

72
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,960
- We're moving to Costa Rica! - Yeah!

73
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,480
- What?! - When?

74
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,270
In a couple of weeks. The cost of living is so low down there,

75
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,490
you know? We found this beautiful place on the water.

76
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,090
It's got its own private beach.

77
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,200
Bathing suits are optional.

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,160
But encouraged.

79
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,790
Ay, I'm going to miss you guys.

80
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,660
Don't worry about it. I give it three months, tops.

81
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,770
You hate the beach. And you know how humid it is down there?

82
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,150
I love the steam room at the club.

83
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,310
It's the same thing, except I don't have to see you

84
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,710
sitting there like a pile of melted ice cream.

85
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,860
'cause you're Tom Selleck in a towel.

86
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,210
I'm just ready for an adventure.

87
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,380
I want to try something new.

88
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,580
Stick around here. Pick up a check every now and then.

89
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,840
Why do you always have to be so negative?

90
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,110
I think it's great.

91
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,080
No, you're right. I'm sorry.

92
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,930
I'm surprised, that's all.

93
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,850
Let's toast this amazing new chapter of your lives.

94
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,900
To mosquitoes the size of your fist.

95
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,870
This is why all your friends move away.

96
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,240
To us, alone at last.

97
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,320
We both look very handsome tonight.

98
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,880
You know, if you -- if you'd just said

99
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,740
that I looked handsome, I would have said, "So do you."

100
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,510
I couldn't take that chance.

101
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,360
I wanted to get off on the right foot.

102
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,210
Mitchell and I desperately need

103
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,570
a romantic night out to reconnect.

104
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,040
Yeah. I don't --

105
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,840
I don't know if it's the stress of planning a wedding,

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,450
but we've been a little tense with each other lately, huh?

107
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,860
Even our friend J'marcus said how bitchy we've been.

108
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,950
What -- when did he say that?

109
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,760
Oh, at Pepper's party

110
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,700
that night you wore those pants that don't fit you anymore.

111
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,460
Oh, right. And you brought that bad wine that everybody hated.

112
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,990
- See? We really need this. - We really do.

113
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,780
Oh, you know, uh, Pepper said

114
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,960
that for our cake tasting,

115
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,230
we needed to have --

116
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,850
Remember our rules -- no wedding talk, no Lily talk.

117
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,470
I'm sorry. No, you're right.

118
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,500
So, just gonna...

119
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,760
Should we hear the specials again?

120
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,650
We can't ask him a third time.

121
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,130
You know what I might try when I'm down there?

122
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,110
Surfing.

123
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,940
So it's gonna be a closed casket.

124
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,850
My turn.

125
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,570
What are you talking about? I just sunk the 3 ball.

126
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,380
Then you moved the cue ball with your stick

127
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,940
while you were telling me how you were gonna move away

128
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,970
from Southern California to try surfing.

129
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:33,820
I didn't touch the cue ball.

130
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah, I know. But you did.

131
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,820
You're calling me a cheater? You?

132
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,510
The guy on the golf course who can't seem to count higher than 5?

133
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,880
Maybe I can't keep track of my shots

134
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,780
because somebody won't stop talking.

135
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,680
It is in my nature to comment on

136
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,180
the bizarre and unusual things I see in the world,

137
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,200
like that convulsion you call a golf swing.

138
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,710
You know what? I'm done here.

139
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,820
No, I've done.

140
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,470
I will not have my integrity questioned here.

141
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,750
I was a Marine.

142
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,260
I served with guys who died.

143
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,300
Of old age!

144
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,420
You never left the states!

145
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,880
Are you saying I didn't serve my country?

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,230
Which one, America or Costa Rica?

147
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,520
What's with you and Costa Rica?!

148
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
It's a terrible idea!

149
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,340
You get into things without thinking,

150
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,870
and you need to be rescued,

151
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,880
like that time you bought that car

152
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,340
that was supposed to turn into a boat!

153
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,420
- Yeah? - It turned into a reef!

154
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,030
That's 'cause you left your door cracked open!

155
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, it was my fault.

156
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,010
Mark my words --

157
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,010
Costa Rica is another amphibicar

158
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,070
at the bottom of a lake.

159
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,240
Only this time, I won't be bailing you out!

160
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,430
Who asked you?!

161
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,960
Darlene, we're going!

162
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,530
Wha-- wha-- what do you mean, we're going?

163
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,750
Gracias, Gloria.

164
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,100
That was a lovely dinner.

165
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,960
And you are an incredible woman for putting up with this gringo!

166
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,860
- Come on! - What happened?

167
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,180
Good luck in Costa Rica!

168
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,730
- Aw, thanks, Jay. - He didn't mean it!

169
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,310
I know! I'm trying to defuse the tension.

170
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,140
- Here we go, guys. - Oh, yeah!

171
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,360
- Three more Mojitos. - Yum!

172
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,850
Aren't these yum?

173
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,570
I didn't even drink the first one.

174
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,860
Are you sure? 'cause I don't think it drank itself.

175
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,580
No, it did not.

176
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,690
Look, I have no problem drinking.

177
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,810
I can literally do it standing on my head.

178
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,600
But, "A," not with my parents,

179
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,650
and plus, also, I needed to stay sharp,

180
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,210
because they were obviously up to something,

181
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,640
and I was in no mood.

182
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,260
I barely got 10 hours of sleep last night.

183
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,690
So, I'll go get you guys some more water,

184
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,140
and your food should be out in just a few minutes.

185
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,430
Thanks so much, pal. We appreciate it.

186
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,650
He seems like a real go-getter, huh?

187
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,320
Oh, 'cause he goes and gets things?

188
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,780
I wonder what he wants to do with his life.

189
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,710
I wonder that about people all the time.

190
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,350
I think that's very common,

191
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,110
to wonder about other people's aspirations.

192
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,960
I do it all the time.

193
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,240
- Yeah, you do. - Yeah. Here we go.

194
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,980
Hey, Brian, you're a young guy.

195
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,720
Wha-- wha-- what do you want to do after this? What's your plan?

196
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,540
Uh, to be perfectly honest,

197
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,050
I'm probably gonna go home, watch a movie, and get high.

198
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,390
You guys looking for something to do?

199
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,610
No. No. No.

200
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,410
Oh. I mean, I think I got extra.

201
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,040
No, no, that's --

202
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,820
I-I think he meant your plan for your life,

203
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,440
not -- not just tonight.

204
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,650
Oh. I want to be a screenwriter.

205
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,370
- Ambitious. - And -- and so interesting.

206
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,840
Isn't that interesting, Haley?

207
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,570
- Sure. - You should tell him what you're doing.

208
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,690
Oh, you mean after we all go get high with Brian?

209
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,510
That's not happening.

210
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,450
I'm sorry. I meant that --

211
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,250
No, I know what you meant.

212
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,620
Hey, Brian, could you give us a second?

213
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,090
Uh, ye-- sure.

214
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,510
So this is what this whole night's about --

215
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,620
the drinks, the pretending to be my friend?

216
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,960
We are your friend.

217
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,490
Honey, we care about you.

218
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,010
And we want to make sure that you -- you've got a plan,

219
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,130
'cause it seems like you're meandering.

220
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,740
No. Sweetie, don't just start texting

221
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,490
because you don't like the conversation.

222
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,270
- Here. - What is this?

223
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,160
That's a blog that I've been doing.

224
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,020
I'm really liking my photography,

225
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,420
and people always say that they like the way that I dress,

226
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,410
so I've been posting pictures of my outfits on this site.

227
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,730
I know it's not a huge money-maker right now,

228
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,960
but I do get money whenever someone clicks on a link

229
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,600
and buys something that I wore.

230
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,710
I'm gonna take a business class next semester,

231
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,310
which I'm hoping will help me turn all of this

232
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,380
into becoming a stylist.

233
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,180
I have 1,200 followers.

234
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,070
Most are women who want to know what to wear.

235
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,390
Some are men who want to know what I'm wearing,

236
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,390
But, you know, I'm trying to figure a way

237
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,370
to block all of the pervs.

238
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,060
So, yeah. I guess that is my plan.

239
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,850
It's amazing.

240
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,390
We are so proud of you.

241
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,440
Don't even, guys. You always assume the worst of me.

242
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,120
Honey --

243
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,730
No, you guys sit here

244
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,010
acting like we're drinking buddies, judging me,

245
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,490
when I have a better handle on my future

246
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,730
than either one of you did at my age.

247
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,550
You? You wanted to be a magician.

248
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,510
And you were changing your major every three minutes,

249
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,290
according to grandpa --

250
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,020
who, by the way,

251
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,550
has been drinking with me for years

252
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,640
because he loves me,

253
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,130
and he thinks I say funny things when I'm buzzed.

254
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,560
Well, apparently, the situation in Syria is worsening.

255
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,500
I know.

256
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,630
In fact, now U.N. evidence suggests that Assad was --

257
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,580
Are you reading this off your phone?

258
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,540
What?!

259
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,330
You're --

260
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,080
No! No! What --

261
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,030
- I was just making sure my facts were straight... - Cam.

262
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,610
...before I started a spirited conversation of current events.

263
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:46,970
Yeah.

264
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,930
What else does it say?

265
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,740
Thank you.

266
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,210
Sorry. Is that the tuna tartare?

267
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,580
Yes, and it is delicious.

268
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,280
Oh, I should've ordered it.

269
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,300
Would you like a taste?

270
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,260
Oh, no. But thank you. That's very sweet.

271
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,360
She really means it. Uh, Katie loves sharing food.

272
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,350
Me, too. You know, I think

273
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,510
it's growing up in a big family,

274
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,280
'cause everything at suppertime on the table

275
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,710
was up for grabs.

276
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,850
We didn't say grace.

277
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,880
We said, "On your marks, get set, go."

278
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,490
You sound exactly like my dad.

279
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,340
He was from this really big family in Missouri, and --

280
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
Shut up!

281
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,190
I'm a Missouri farm boy, myself!

282
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,590
- Stop! - Oh, my gosh! I'm Cam.

283
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,450
Well, right pleased to meet you, Cam.

284
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,400
This is Brandon.

285
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,360
Hi. She doesn't really talk like that.

286
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,200
Oh, well, he slips in and out of his accent

287
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,930
like Kate Winslet in "Titanic."

288
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,180
- Uh, I'm Mitchell, by the way. - Hi.

289
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,600
- Hi. - What -- what's yours, Brandon?

290
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,990
It looks delicious, too.

291
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,150
It's the truffle parmesan gnocchi.

292
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,960
Do you know what, though? If you want a bite of that,

293
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,400
you're barking up the wrong tree.

294
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,160
'cause that dish is in a strict no-share zone.

295
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,050
I just --

296
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,750
I don't like people eating off my plate.

297
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,620
Yeah, because you're not an animal. I'm the same way.

298
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,440
Oh, my gosh! You're exactly us!

299
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,760
No, you guys are more interesting,

300
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,970
'cause you have the whole gay thing.

301
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,290
Katie, you don't know if they're gay.

302
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,190
Okay, that's adorable.

303
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,050
Yeah, it was -- it was a pretty safe bet.

304
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,850
Okay. I'm running to the powder room.

305
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,210
Cam, please try the tartare,

306
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,870
because whatever you order, I want a taste.

307
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,680
Okay. Well, don't you dillydally,

308
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,810
because I ain't exactly slow once I tie on the ol' feed bag!

309
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,190
Calm down, honey boo boo.

310
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,490
- She's so cute! - Very adorable.

311
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,090
So, Brandon, what do you do for a living? Are you --

312
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,940
Look, guys. I-I hate to be blunt,

313
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,670
but could you please give us some space?

314
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,310
Not a problem.

315
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,800
Look, no -- no, it's --

316
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,000
I mean, you guys are great. But I'm gonna...

317
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,710
propose to Katie tonight.

318
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,850
And I'm kind of feeling -- yeah.

319
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,730
What?! Here?!

320
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,370
Oh, my god! That's amazing!

321
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,820
We just got engaged a few months ago.

322
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,060
Great.

323
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,120
Yeah, so we will definitely give you your privacy.

324
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,370
- Congratulations. - Absolutely.

325
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,550
Yeah. Good luck.

326
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,640
You know what? If you wanted,

327
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,200
I could pretend like I'm texting,

328
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,720
and I could video the whole thing on my phone.

329
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,200
That way, you'd have it forever.

330
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,140
Really? I mean, that -- yeah.

331
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,740
- That would be awesome. - A-are you sure?

332
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,260
He gets very, uh, well, excited.

333
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,980
And he might give it away.

334
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,990
Mitchell, um, I think I know Katie well enough

335
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,090
to tell if she's getting suspicious.

336
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,190
- Cam?! - She said I could.

337
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,830
The hell's the corkscrew?

338
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,730
Do you want to talk about it?

339
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,190
There's nothing to talk about!

340
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,710
Shorty does dumb things all the time.

341
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,460
You mark my words -- in three months,

342
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,400
he'll be back here needing money.

343
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
Maybe this is not about Shorty coming back.

344
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,030
Maybe this is about Shorty not coming back.

345
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,250
Manny.

346
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,770
What she's saying is, deep down,

347
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,300
you're afraid Shorty's going to love Costa Rica,

348
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,910
and you'll lose your best friend forever.

349
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,870
That's what you do.

350
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,560
You push people away, so when they leave,

351
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,220
it doesn't hurt that much.

352
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,560
I don't get it. You're the greatest generation,

353
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,650
but why can't you feel?

354
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,280
Why can't you spend your teen years

355
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,040
locked in your bedroom like a normal kid?

356
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,220
See? Now he's doing it to me.

357
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,130
Uh, you have to face it, Jay.

358
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,010
One day, I'll be moving out of this house.

359
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,260
Can I get that in writing?

360
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,190
'cause I just can't shake this image of a 30-year-old you

361
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,710
eating my food and cuddling with my wife.

362
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,710
Boys should never stop cuddling their mothers.

363
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,180
I'm gonna have nightmares!

364
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,260
You pretend to be so tough.

365
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,350
But you know what I think?

366
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,170
I think that deep down,

367
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,840
you're the most sensitive person in this house.

368
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,550
See?

369
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,830
You did it again.

370
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,110
I say something that strikes a nerve,

371
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,000
and immediately, you cannot handle it.

372
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,100
That's why you "Pbht" in my face!

373
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,700
We just found the one thing you can't make sexy.

374
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,600
There it is again.

375
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,820
I need a drink.

376
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,070
Jay, you have to make this right with Shorty.

377
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,500
You have to tell him how you feel!

378
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,900
He has been a great compadre with you for many years.

379
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,530
Besides, who else is going to laugh at your jokes?

380
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,400
Lots of people laugh at my jokes.

381
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,270
Name one person that doesn't work for you.

382
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,680
Hey, you know what? Why don't you two just go cuddle?

383
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,560
Okay, here she comes.

384
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:36,650
Stay calm.

385
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,300
- You're gonna spoil it. - You stay calm.

386
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,730
Ooh, that looks good. What is it?

387
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,310
Um, uh, this is the grilled calamari.

388
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,560
It's scrumptious. Would you care for a ring?

389
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,520
I -- um, I mean, dig in there, girlfriend!

390
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,320
Oh, no, that's okay. Thank you.

391
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,200
This looks so delicious.

392
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, mine's delicious, too.

393
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,320
Katie...

394
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,460
You look so beautiful tonight.

395
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,460
You know, I-I've never met anyone like you,

396
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,820
and I know that I never will. And I...

397
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,990
I love you so much.

398
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,580
Will you make me the happiest man on earth

399
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,110
- and be my bride? - What?!

400
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,600
Oh, my god!

401
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,220
- No! - No?

402
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,240
No!

403
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,280
Sorry.

404
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,070
Did you know that this place used to be a bank?

405
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,860
Was it, really?

406
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,230
I just -- I don't want to be married, Brandon.

407
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,620
We'll end up like one of those couples

408
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,500
that just sits there with nothing to talk about

409
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,590
until we glom on to other people.

410
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,760
I can't believe this. You -- you don't love me?

411
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,120
- NO! - NO?

412
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,610
- I'm sor... - NO!

413
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,140
I need some air.

414
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,230
So, Syria, any updates?

415
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,910
- No, nothing yet. - Nothing.

416
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,210
Do you remember how cute she was when she was little

417
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,790
- and she couldn't say her P's?  - "BAKE A-TATOES."

418
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,770
"Bake a-tatoes" and "Attlesauce".

419
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,390
"Attlesauce"!

420
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,740
"Can I have attlesauce?"

421
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,560
First of all, you're screaming.

422
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,570
Can we just get the check, please?

423
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,750
Could you please not be mad at us anymore?

424
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,550
We are very sorry that you felt manipulated.

425
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,390
You know what I'm pretty sure is ironic?

426
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,090
You guys spend all this time worrying

427
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,280
about what I'm going to do,

428
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,750
and maybe you should start thinking

429
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,520
about what you're going to do.

430
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,860
What are you talking about?

431
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,930
Well, what are you gonna do when we're gone?

432
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,760
What's your plan?

433
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,830
- Uh, to be fine. - Yeah.

434
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,240
- 'cause we're fine. - Totally.

435
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,770
You guys are gone.

436
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,630
We get an R.V. Bam!

437
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,440
Me, mama...

438
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,700
and our dog, Merlin, hit the open road.

439
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,240
No. I am not spending my golden years

440
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,840
driving around an R.V. park,

441
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,720
looking for a place to plug my house in.

442
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,570
No. I am gonna go see the world.

443
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,640
Where do you wanna go?

444
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,320
I don't know, Phil. India. Africa.

445
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,450
Diarrhea. Diarrhea.

446
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,950
Wow. It sounds like you guys really need to start thinking

447
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,310
about your future.

448
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,040
Are you just gonna put Merlin in a kennel when we're gone?

449
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,150
Okay, Phil, Merlin doesn't exist.

450
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,410
And why do you want to get a dog to take care of

451
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,630
so soon after the kids leave?

452
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,680
Well, I'm gonna need someone to love me, Claire.

453
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,880
And in the meantime, mom,

454
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,450
grandpa wants you to take over the business, but...

455
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,590
Do you want that?

456
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,090
I-I guess I hadn't thought this far into the future.

457
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,450
And, dad, are you just gonna keep selling houses?

458
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,480
I mean, I don't want to blow your mind here,

459
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,830
but you could still be a magician.

460
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,990
I could.

461
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,170
He couldn't.

462
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,100
Really?

463
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,980
This salt shaker behind your head says different.

464
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,230
Oh, Phil, you're getting salt all over me.

465
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,750
I feel like a Margarita.

466
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,810
- You got it! - No, no, no, no, no, no!

467
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,610
Just the check, please.

468
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,560
Okay.

469
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,000
Thank you so much.

470
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,350
- Thanks, buddy. - Yeah.

471
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,850
Oh, no. I left my wallet in the other coat.

472
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,200
I did not bring my purse.

473
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,870
It's fine, guys. I got this.

474
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,400
- Honey, thank you. - Oh, thank you, sweetie.

475
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,040
- I should probably drive, too, huh? - Probably.

476
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,380
- I gue-- yeah. - Yeah.

477
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,500
Why don't you guys have the valet pull the car up

478
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,870
while I pay the check?

479
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,130
That we can do.

480
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,240
Uh, you guys, it's that way.

481
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,770
- Mm-hmm. - It is.

482
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,620
Y-you know, for the record, we do have a lot to talk about.

483
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,500
Yeah, we just took a couple of topics off the table

484
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,620
because we wanted to have a romantic date night.

485
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,480
And it probably put too much pressure on it to be special,

486
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,760
but the truth is, every day I spend with this man is special.

487
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,930
Oh, Cam!

488
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,260
Oh, no, I'm the lucky one.

489
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,830
There we are.

490
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,890
I'm sorry.

491
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,430
I guess I just panicked when Brandon asked me.

492
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,780
I mean, we're so different. And I know it seems petty,

493
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,630
but it speaks to something bigger.

494
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,320
I don't know if I can spend the rest of my life

495
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,510
with the kind of guy who won't let me eat off his plate.

496
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,880
Trust me -- it can be done.

497
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,360
And I should not make such a big deal about that.

498
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,670
I promise I'll try and do better.

499
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,170
No, you're right. You don't like it,

500
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:53,030
and I should respect that more.

501
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,780
Are you guys married?

502
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,880
Oh, this May.

503
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,250
- But, basically, we've been married for years. - Yeah.

504
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,530
I-I mean, is Cam everything that I dreamed of?

505
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,580
Tread lightly, counselor.

506
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,780
Yes. Yes, he is.

507
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,450
Because through all the compromises

508
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,200
and negotiations and arguments

509
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,850
and sometimes even boredom,

510
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,620
I cannot picture my life without him.

511
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,190
That's very sweet.

512
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,760
I would've scooted past the boredom, but...

513
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,300
At the end of the day, Katie, you have to ask yourself,

514
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,820
can you imagine your life without this person?

515
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,720
Hey. All right, look.

516
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,990
I, uh, paid the check, okay? Let's just go.

517
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,590
Brandon, can you just please sit?

518
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,730
I've been talking to the guys here,

519
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,170
and they really opened my eyes.

520
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,480
They did?

521
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,400
Yes.

522
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,160
I've been trying to picture my life without you, and...

523
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,460
You know what?

524
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,410
I can.

525
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,100
We didn't tell her that.

526
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,850
I didn't say that.

527
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,170
No, I want what you guys have, okay?

528
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,730
I'm sorry, Brandon.

529
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,280
I am so sorry, but we both deserve that.

530
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,750
I've never been so sure of anything.

531
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:51,990
You know what? I'm just...

532
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,740
gonna go get a cab, okay?

533
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,150
Goodbye.

534
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,670
And thank you.

535
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,570
- Don't-- don't thank us! - We didn't do anything,

536
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,320
So... we didn't, honestly.

537
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,070
This is the worst night of my life.

538
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm sorry.

539
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,130
But, I mean, um, a-at least now it's over.

540
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:08,410
You can... start to move on.

541
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,530
I've been trying to picture my life without you.

542
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,540
And you know what?

543
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,210
- S-stupid phone. - I can.

544
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,310
It's a... devil phone.

545
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,090
When Mitchell was born, he was a month premature.

546
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,610
So it was touch and go there for a while.

547
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:27,950
It's 2 a.m.

548
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,950
I walk out into the hospital waiting room to get some air,

549
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,710
and there's Shorty.

550
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,360
He'd been sitting there for six hours

551
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,980
and refused to leave for the next two days.

552
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,980
That's where we got Mitchell's middle name.

553
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,190
Not Shorty --

554
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,570
Vincent.

555
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,650
"M.V.P."

556
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,000
We were a little premature on that one, too.

557
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,540
Gloria, I'm going for a drive!

558
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,050
Say hi to Shorty for me!

559
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,410
I'm not talking to you!

560
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,220
I was just coming to see you.

561
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,300
Um, I left my jacket.

562
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,890
Oh! There it is! Come on in.

563
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,020
Uh, Shorty, you know that stuff I said, uh --

564
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,080
- Yeah, I get it. - We're good, huh?

565
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,190
Under the bridge.

566
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,000
All right. I'll see you.

567
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,190
Shorty, wait.

568
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,310
I need to say something to you.

569
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,280
Yeah.

570
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,280
I want to thank you...

571
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,810
for all the great times we've had.

572
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,620
Yeah. We, um...

573
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,110
- We had a lot of laughs. - Yeah.

574
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,590
And you should know that, uh...

575
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,750
you're my best friend.

576
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,590
You know?

577
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,330
Probably the best friend I'm ever gonna have.

578
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,460
Jay, I mean... what are you doing to me?

579
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,100
This is hard for me. I'm just...

580
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,540
I'm just trying to tell you how I feel.

581
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,740
Well, I'm gonna tell you how I feel.

582
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,000
I admire the hell out of you, Jay.

583
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,330
I always tell Darlene, "That's a real guy."

584
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,260
Self-made, stand-up,

585
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,860
the kind of guy you want to be in a foxhole with.

586
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,180
Well, I'm not all that.

587
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,090
Well, it's not like I've been in a foxhole.

588
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,330
I'm gonna miss you, Vincent.

589
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,170
I'm gonna miss you, too.

590
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,310
I love you.

591
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,500
I love you, too, Jay bird.

592
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,080
I really, really do.

593
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,650
You call me, okay?

594
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,710
Every day.

595
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,400
Every damn day.

596
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,360
If I'm being honest,

597
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,440
this is a little girlier than I thought.

598
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,470
Two years.

599
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,100
How could she just walk away?

600
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,930
- You know what? She did you a favor. - Absolutely.

601
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,810
- You can do so much better. - Oh, my god. Insanely better.

602
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,140
No, he's not kidding. Brandon, you are seriously gorge!

603
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,140
If you ask me, she got the better end of the deal.

604
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,970
You really think so?

605
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,320
- Yes! Yes! - Yes!

606
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,110
And her whole fake blond thing? I don't know.

607
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,330
- It was kind of trampy. - And truth be told,

608
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,650
she didn't seem that bright.

609
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,800
And is she older than you?

610
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,460
- Because she looked significantly older than you. - Trust us.

611
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,040
This is the best thing that's ever happened to you.

612
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,440
Best thing that's ever happened to you.

613
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,260
Oh! Thank god you're still here!

614
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,980
I was on my way home, and all of a sudden, I started crying.

615
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,370
And I realized I was just scared.

616
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,240
And I love you. And I'm so, so sorry.

617
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,610
And, yes, Brandon, if you'll still have me,

618
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,900
Yes, I will marry you!

619
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,660
- So nice meeting you. - Okay.
