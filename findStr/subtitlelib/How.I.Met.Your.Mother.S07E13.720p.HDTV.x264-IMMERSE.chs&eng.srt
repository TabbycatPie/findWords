1
00:00:00,354 --> 00:00:02,934
孩子们 在2012年的第一天
Kids,on New Year's Day 2012,

2
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,936
马修叔叔去了一趟明尼苏达
Uncle Marshall took a trip to Minnesota

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,921
去看望一个他真心想念的人
to see someone he truly missed.

4
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:14,029
嘿 老爸
Hey, Pop.

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:16,247
不敢相信一年就这么过去了
I can't believe it's been a year.

6
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:19,233
我认为追忆关于你那美好的回忆
I think the most appropriate way

7
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:22,570
最合适的方式
to honor your memory today...

8
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:23,872
就是颓废下来
is to get blasted

9
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:25,840
看着维京队把熊队
and watch the Vikings make the Bears

10
00:00:25,842 --> 00:00:26,958
虐的不成样
their furry little bitches.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
走着 维京人 嘘
Go, Vikes! MOURNER: Shh.

12
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,679
不好意思了
Sorry for your loss.

13
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:33,181
老爸 我们在大概三个小时的时间里
Which is what we'll be saying to the Bears

14
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:34,599
该对熊队说些什么呢
in about three hours, right, Pop?

15
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,385
孩子们 狂热地观看维京对阵熊队的比赛
Kids, tailgating at the Vikings-Bears game

16
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:40,388
是马修叔叔和他爸爸的传统
was a tradition for Uncle Marshall and his dad.

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,806
这就是政府如何
That's how the government

18
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,425
掩盖罗斯威尔UFO坠毁事件的
covered up the UFO crash in Roswell:

19
00:00:44,427 --> 00:00:47,946
把切成片的外星人尸体装成罐
by canning the sliced up alien carcasses

20
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,603
称之为猪肉罐头 
and calling it Spam.

21
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:54,919
也就是"外星肉类切片加工"
A.K.A, Sliced Processed Alien Meat

22
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,154
哇
Wow.

23
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,540
世界上还有你不知道的事儿吗 爸
Is there anything you don't know, Dad?

24
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:59,774
没有
No.

25
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:01,609
我知道绝大多数的事情
I know most stuff.

26
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:03,995
对您来说
And in your honor...

27
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,966
三十年的猪肉脂肪 打火机油和奔肌

额滴神呀 就是这个味儿
Dear God, that's the stuff.

29
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,339
这么多可以让我追寻你的
So much to catch you up on.

30
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,475
昨晚是新年夜
So, last night was New Year's Eve.

31
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,460
这是一个疯狂的故事
That's a crazy story.

32
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:21,880
你还没告诉你爸爸你已经怀孕了么
So you haven't told your dad that you're pregnant yet?

33
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:24,465
没呢 不过我为什么要说呢
No. But why should I?

34
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,300
我爸爸从来都不关心我
My dad has never been there for me.

35
00:01:26,302 --> 00:01:28,970
这只会让我再一次的对他失望
This is just another chance for him to let me down.

36
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:31,906
莉莉 你得告诉他
Lily, you have to tell him.

37
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:34,993
他在芝加哥的一个桌游大会上
He's at some board game convention in Chicago.

38
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:37,579
他是你爸爸
He's your dad.

39
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,247
我不知道为什么人们不明白
I don't see why people aren't getting this.

40
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,532
商店扒手游戏不推崇犯罪
Shoplifter does not promote crime.

41
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:43,334
这是庆祝这个的
It celebrates it.

42
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,986
不好意思
Excuse me.

43
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,320
谁
Yeah.

44
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,872
嘿 爸爸
Hey, Dad.

53
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,151
嘿 别走 别走 入场费50美元

你有什么问题么
You got a problem with that?

58
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:25,894
孩子们 这就是我们为什么没有继续纠缠下去
Kids, here's why we didn't have a problem with that.

59
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:30,448
他没戴假发看起来更可怕了
And he was even scarier without the toupee.

60
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,966
没问题 外面小风吹着挺好的
No problem. It's a little drafty.

61
00:02:31,968 --> 00:02:33,751
我们给您带一杯可可热饮
We'll get you a nice hot cocoa.

00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,094
谢天谢地我不用做
Thank God I don't have to produce

65
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,262
这个屎成冰坨子一般的破节目
this frozen pile of poo.

66
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,513
你怎么没做这个节目
How'd you dodge that bullet?

67
00:02:45,515 --> 00:02:48,733
呃 也许蒂娜 制片人 她就
Well, maybe Tina, the producer, she, uh, picked,

68
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,351
四脚朝天躺着等着桑迪在她身上乱搞的时候
is more talented than I am...

69
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:53,188
决定选一个更有天赋的人吧
at lying down while Sandy does his business on her.

70
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,356
让这个变态做直播
Does it bother you that this pervert's

71
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:56,858
不会烦你么 好像你也不在意这个了
on the air, and you're not anymore?

72
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,193
你怀念吗
Do you miss it?

73
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,580
什么 为啥 为啥我要怀念呢
What? Why would... why would I miss it?

74
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,749
不 我宁愿
No. I would rather

75
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,919
在我的公寓里暖和又舒服的待着
be warm and cozy here in denial-- my apartment.

76
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,420
罗宾 我不是心理医生
Robin, I'm no therapist--

77
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,372
等等 是 我是
wait, yes, I am--

78
00:03:11,374 --> 00:03:14,075
但是我对你有个新年祝愿
but I've got a New Year's resolution for you.

79
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:15,409
回到荧幕上去
Get back on camera.

80
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:18,763
我的愿望是拍一部"小制作A片" 这样就正好一举两得喽
Mine was going to be "Make a sex tape," So... two birds.

81
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,217
你继续想
Hold that thought.

82
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,935
你好
Hello?

83
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,253

蒂娜跟我分了
Tina quit.

85
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,023
我爱的那个女人跟我分了
The woman I love just quit.

86
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:31,142
爱 她是我的全部 罗宾
Love? She's my everything, Robin.

87
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:34,729
我的太阳 我的星星 我的氧气
My sun, my stars, my oxygen.

88
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:37,482
补充一下 她喜欢更快更淫乱
Plus, she likes it fast and dirty,

89
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,617
这就是我桑迪的作风
and that's how Sandy rides.

90
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,536
我需要你尽快过来
I need you here ASAP.

91
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,987
你开玩笑么
Are you kidding me?

92
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,405
马库斯
Marcus?

93
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,790
你丫在这干嘛呢
What the heck are you doing here?

94
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,742
你丫又在这干嘛呢
What the heck are you doing here?

95
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:51,045
我今天想来看看爸爸 私下的
I wanted to see Dad today-- in private.

96
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,780
好吧 我有同样的想法
Well, I had the same idea,

97
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,884
我一路从妈妈那开车过来 所以你滚蛋吧
and I drove all the way from Mom's, so get lost.

98
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,303
我是飞过来的 所以你滚蛋吧
I flew here, so you get lost.

99
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:00,505
呃 我试着跟我们已经逝去的爸爸
Um, I'm trying to have a poignant moment

100
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:03,508
度过一段感人至深的时光 便便脸
with our departed father, turd face.

101
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,310
好吧 我试着感受爸爸的意志
Well, I'm trying to feel Dad's spirit

102
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,896
轻拂我的灵魂 屁股头
flow through my soul,butt breath.

103
00:04:07,898 --> 00:04:09,480
我伸出双手 到达远方
I'm reaching out to the beyond

104
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,300
触碰爸爸的内心之光 你个丑屁股
to touch Dad's inner light, ass clown.

105
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,570
我听见爸爸的声音 犹如圣歌
I hear Dad's voice like an ethereal song

106
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:18,907
指引我得到救赎 你个喷粪的傻逼
guiding me toward salvation, douche nozzle.

107
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:21,859
-爸爸归我  -爸爸归我 正无穷
- Dibs on Dad. - Dibs on Dad times infinity.

108
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,161
嗷 唔
Oh! Ooh.

109
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,079
我就当你根本不存在
I'll just pretend like you're not here.

110
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:27,665
什么
What?

111
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,684
爸爸 你听见没
Dad, do you hear something?

112
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,705
貌似是某个11岁还在尿床的家伙
Perhaps the high-pitched whine of someone who wet their bed

113
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,340
那娘娘腔的哭嚎声
until they were 11!

114
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,541
是10岁了啦
Ten.

115
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:41,679
无论如何 爸爸 既然这就只有咱俩
Anyway, Dad, since it's just the two of us...

116
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:45,300
我告诉你 莉莉和我在新年这天
Lily and I were going to spend New Year's

117
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:46,684
布置育婴房
unpacking the baby room.

118
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,887
额 亲爱的 这书是怎么回事
Um, sweetie, why is this book in here?

119
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,606
那是谜团团
That's Enigmas of The Mystical.

120
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:52,690
是讲神奇的
It's all about mysterious

121
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,192
无法解释的各种现象
and unexplained phenomena.

122
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,978
你不记得八十年代那个电视广告了么
Don't you remember the TV commercials from the '80s?

123
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,230
1983年6月17日
June 17th, 1983.

124
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,898
亚利桑那州 坦佩
Tempe, Arizona.

125
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,101
一个妇女做了一个鸡肉三明治
A woman makes a chicken salad sandwich.

126
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,019
鸡肉三明治
EERIE WHISPERING: Chicken salad sandwich.

127
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,904
而在横跨了半个国家的密歇根
Halfway across the country in Michigan,

128
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,623
她的女儿心念所使般做了
her daughter is compelled to make

129
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,525
一个几乎一模一样的三明治
almost exactly the same sandwich.

130
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:12,910
诡异的低语声:金枪鱼沙拉
EERIE WHISPERING: Tuna salad.

131
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,512
这是巧合么
Coincidence?

132
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,165
还是一个神秘的谜团团！
Or an enigma of the mystical!

133
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,503
啊 那些谜什么的对我来说总是有点薄
Yeah, those enigmas always seemed a bit thin to me.

134
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:25,473
薄? 莉莉 这可是200页 
Thin? Lily, this is 200 pages

135
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:29,043
详细讲述了大脚怪啊 幽灵啊
of detailed accounts about Bigfoot, ghosts,

136
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:31,429
还有外星人把人类从被窝里绑架走 来探测他们
aliens abducting people from their beds and probing them.

137
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,147
我决定了 我给咱宝宝读这个吧
I'm going to read it to Baby Eriksen

138
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,382
就当睡前小故事
at night-night.

139
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:36,351
你真打算在睡前
You really want to read our kid

140
00:05:36,353 --> 00:05:37,902
给咱宝宝读怪物的故事么
bedtime stories about monsters?

141
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,737
第一 我不会用'怪物'这个术语
First of all, I wouldn't use the "M" Word.

142
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,989
除非怪物们自我介绍来着
Only they can call themselves that.

143
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,390
第二 你真决定
And secondly, are you really saying

144
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,492
把我们的宝宝教成个无神论者么
you don't want to raise our child as a believer?

145
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:46,444
我可不想给宝宝洗脑
I don't want to brainwash our child

146
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,496
让它相信些没证据的东西
to believe in something with no proof.

147
00:05:48,498 --> 00:05:50,231
这跟证据神马的没关系 这是关乎信仰的
It's not about proof; it's about faith.

148
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:52,500
信仰 赋予生活形态与意义
Faith is what gives life shape and meaning.

149
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,419
我是说 如果没有雪人和矮妖
I mean, if there aren't yetis or leprechauns,

150
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,504
早上起床还有什么意义呢
what's the point of even getting up in the morning?

151
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:57,789
我不晓得
I don't know.

莉莉 你不相信世上有比我们更强大的东西
Lily, don't you think it's a bit narcissistic

154
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:07,048
这不是有点自恋么
not to allow for something bigger than us out there?

155
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,467
你不觉得 有些东西 他们的美丽 力量和威严
Something whose beauty and power

156
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,686
会让我们森森的颤抖么
and majesty humbles us?

157
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:13,521
-比如上帝  -比如狼人
-God? -Werewolves.

在我们倒数2012的时候

知道不 现在是新年啦
Okay? It's New Year's Eve.

173

人山人海 东西乱碎
People get rowdy and break stuff.

174
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,260
这样的掩护会保护咱们
The cover protects us.

别费心了 各位
Don't bother, everybody.

181
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,906
麦克莱伦简直是明抢
MacLaren's is a rip-off!

182
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,157
大家最好
You'd all be better off

183
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:08,476
上楼去我那喝酒去
coming upstairs to my place for a beer.

泰德 你还记得几年前不
Ted, do you remember a couple yea ago,

186
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,652
那时我们有个宏伟的志向
we had the best idea of a time?

187
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,004
我们应该买个酒吧
We should buy a bar.

188

别人就会问了"为啥叫你猜?"
People will be like, "Why is it called Puzzles?"

192
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:31,682
我们就说"你猜"
That's the puzzle.

193
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,502
我们的酒吧 价格低廉
A bar where no one's overcharged,

194
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:37,605

桑迪死哪儿去了 不知道啊
- Where's Sandy?  - I don't know.

204
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:02,130
那么咱们看看他是否还戴着麦

等我找着他 看我不宰了他

00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:29,138
-不管怎么说 老爸   -别再独占老爸一人了
- Anyway, Dad...   - Stop hogging Dad already.

214

00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:37,681

So, anyway...

218
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:41,401
1972年 7月8号

219
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:42,569
怀俄明州 夏延河
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

220
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:45,405
一个猎人发现他面前有一个毛茸茸的东西
A hunter spots a hairy form in the fore.

221
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:46,690
大脚怪
Bigfoot.

222
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,858
他的故事被驳回
His story is dismissed

223
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,410
因为 说实话他喝多了
because, to be honest, he'd been drinking

224
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:52,979
而且有精神病史
and had a history of mental problems.

225
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:54,581
但这真是一个骗局吗
But was it a hoax?

226
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,533

00:09:00,989 --> 00:09:04,174
谜题啊 猩猩装而已
Enigma! Gorilla suit!

跟老爸单独相处一会儿
Having a private moment with Dad.

233
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:13,016
才不是 是我要和老爸单独呆一会儿
No, I'm having a private moment with Dad.

234
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:16,269
都散了 我才可以和老爸有一点时间独处
No, I'm having a private moment with Dad.

算了 老爸
Anyway, Dad,

238
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,117
既然现在还是我们的二人世界
since it's still just the two of us,

239
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,685
我接着说
I'll go on.

240
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,409
我一直想象你猜酒吧应该是个无数来自扭腰客的
I've always envisioned Puzzles as a literary salon,

241
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:41,545
文艺青年们慕名而来的文化沙龙
where Gotham's intelligentsia hold court

242
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,880
谈论艺术 哲学 还有文学
on art, philosophy and literature.

243
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:45,382
可以的
Great.

244
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,418
而且当你支开那些宅腐肥妞时
And while you're distracting the nerds and fatties,

245
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,703
我将在这个贵宾房一本满足了
I'll be in the VIP room getting it in.

246
00:09:50,705 --> 00:09:52,589
唔 那个 哥们 我不知道
Uh, yeah, dude, I don't know

247
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,258
你从哪里搞来了绒索栏 可你总不能
where you got a velvet rope, but you can't

248
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,394
在我的房间里和陌生人翻云覆雨吧
use my room for anonymous sex.

249
00:09:57,396 --> 00:09:59,346
我有点洁癖的啦
I'm kind of a neat freak that way.

250
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,214
嘿 筒子们 我有个好主意
Hey, guys, I have an idea for Puzzles.

251
00:10:01,216 --> 00:10:04,531
如果.....这样呢
What if... What?

252
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:07,571
你猜是只有我们两人才…
Puzzle is kind of a shared envision

253
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,489
哦 好吧 我懂得
Oh. Okay. I understand.

254
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:10,890
不过我们看好你的干劲啊
But he we like your energy.

255
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:12,637
要不你就做我们的首席酒保吧
How would you like to be our star bartender.

256
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,894
我一直就想要当个酒保了
I've always wanted to be a bartender.

257
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:16,196
这就像心理咨询师一样
It's just like being a therapist.

258
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,843
你聆听别人的问题 假装很关心
You listen to people's problems, pretend to care,

259
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,068
但你就可以敞开喝了
but you can drink openly,

260
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,501
不用掖掖藏藏的把酒放在咖啡杯里喝
instead of having to hide your booze in a coffee mug.

261
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:22,836
不错 对了 听听看
Great. Oh, check it out.

262
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:25,422
我们为你猜吧搞了首主题曲
We worked out a theme song for Puzzles.

263
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,923
而我扛着100磅的小酒桶
While I was carrying 100-pound kegs

264
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:28,925
走4段楼梯 爽
up four flights of stairs? Awesome.

265
00:10:33,527 --> 00:10:37,385
如果你来你猜酒吧 
Puzzles is a place where people go

266
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,387
这里就是你的家
To feel like they belong

267
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:44,511
妹纸只要一醉我就啪啪啪 我们不会这样的 哥们儿
Gonna take advantage of dumb drunk girls No, we're not. - Bro

268
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:47,590
这是不对的啊 
That would be a place

269
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:51,531
风趣智慧在这里开花
where wit and wisdom bloom

270
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:56,191
泰德房间摘掉你的花
place to bang chicks in Ted's room

271
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,810
不可能发生 我们得谈谈
Not gonna happen.  We'll talk about it.

272
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,918
你猜吧 大家是一家
At Puzzles, we all fit together

273
00:11:03,004 --> 00:11:05,980
酒保仅此一位
And I'm the bartender!

274
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,583
我去多搬点酒桶
I'll go get the other kegs.

275
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,584
这才是好主意
Probably a good idea.

276
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:10,804
我们得和声一下
We got to work out some harmonies.

277
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:14,871
我在这里啦 不 你其实在下面啊
And I'm right here No, you actually down here

278
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:17,222
不好意思啊 这个电视机
Excuse me, sir? About the TVs,

279
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,759
我们现在在下葬我的姨妈
we in the middle burying my aunt, so...

280
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,897
不用 我只是想来看一下比分如何
No, I just want to check out the score.

281
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,233
事实上 我尽量想和
Actually, I'm trying to have

282
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:28,301
我的老爸单独呆一会儿
a private moment with my dad, so...

283
00:11:28,326 --> 00:11:29,487
哦
Oh.

284
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,821
只是我之前是和我的姨妈一起
It's just that I used to goto Vikes's

285
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:34,574
去看维京队的比赛 愿她安息
with my aunt; may she rest in peace.

286
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:42,082
好了 言归正传
Anyway, so back to my story.

287
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:46,336
她也喜欢汉堡
She also loved burgers.

288
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,594
现在 我接着说
So now, back to my story.

289
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,546
面包烤一烤的话劳拉姨妈会很欣慰的
Aunt Laura sure loved a toasted bun.

290
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:04,387
蒂娜 桑迪一定要在你那里啊
Tina, please tell me Sandy's here.

291
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,640
别担心 他在这里呢
Don't worry, he's here.

292
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,892
我们又回来了 一起回来的
And we're back... together!

293
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,227
他说他爱我 而且他很抱歉
He told me he loves me, he's sorry,

294
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:13,396
他说我是他的唯一
and I'm the only girl for him.

295
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:16,866
那么 既然我们都在一起了
You know, since we're all here,

296
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:19,069
而且我们又那么淫荡
and we're all horny...

297
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:23,189
我不知道哪里出错了
I don't know what went wrong.

298
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,941
唔 你提出要玩双飞是不对的
Well, proposing the three-way was bad,

299
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:26,376
而且我们都不在就开搞是更坏的
starting without us was worse,

300
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,945
在走廊里就完事了你就万劫不复了
finishing in the hallway was the nail in the coffin.

301
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:30,297
停 别喝了
No! Stop drinking!

302
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,582
我得把你揪回去直播
I gotta get you back on air!

303
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,200
我是光棍待脱光
But I'm single and ready to mingle!

304
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:36,419
哟 小妞
Hello, there.

305
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:40,173
哦 那个推特把一家
Oh, the Twitter-verse blowing up about

306
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,258
叫做你猜的全新的公寓主题酒吧吹爆了
a new apartment-themed bar called Puzzles.

307
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,560
为什么叫你猜呢
Why is it called Puzzles?

308
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,312
你猜
That's the puzzle!

309
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:48,014
总之 这间贵宾室最多能容下
Anyway, this VIP room has a maximum occupancy

310
00:12:48,016 --> 00:12:50,934
两个人 包括我 所以一个
of two people including me, so eeny...

311
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,820
你们其他人可以走了
and the rest of you may go.

312
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:57,907
说起来很有趣 但好像每次
It's funny, but it seems each time

313
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:01,027
我读詹姆斯 乔伊斯的《尤利西斯》
I read James Joyce's Ulysses,

314
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:03,396
它都是一本不同的书
it's a different book,

315
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:06,533
要讨论的问题是 是书变了
begging the question: Has the book changed...

316
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,952
还是我变了
or have I?

317
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,741
够了 人们开始变得吵闹 喝醉 还打碎东西
Okay, people are getting rowdy and drunk and breaking things.

318
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:16,909
这违反了你让我背熟的
I know this goes against the Puzzles mission statement

319
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:19,462
你猜责任声明 但我们必须抬高酒价了
you made me memorize, but we gotta raise our drink prices.

320
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:22,182
好吧 只抬一点 这样就没人注意到了
All right, just a little bit so no one will notice.

321
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,221
嘭
Boo!

322
00:13:29,306 --> 00:13:30,890
我猜太逊了
Poodles sucks!

323
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,393
这就是那晚彻底毁掉的时候
And that's when the night turned to absolute crap.

324
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,027
在你猜 我们都很愉快
At Puzzles, we all fit together

325
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,090
所以你猜有了一个保镖
And so Puzzles got a bouncer,

326
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,309
好了 知道该怎么样吗 你们
All right, you know what, you guys?

327
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:12,606
不不不不不不 你说的是按
No. No, no, no, no, no, you said double

328
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:14,023
麦克莱伦的两倍给我钱
what MacLaren's was paying me.

329
00:14:14,802 --> 00:14:17,136
为什么没人戴我拿来的帽子
And why isn't anyone wearing the hats I brought up?!

330
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:22,442
1982年
"November 14th...

佛罗里达的大沼泽地国家公园
"Everglades National Park, Florida.

333
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,649
5个谜一样的的亮光在空中飞舞
"Five mysterious lights dance in the night sky.

334
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,285
一道光线射下 升起了一个公园护林员
"A ray shoots down, lifting the park ranger,

335
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:35,872
公平的说 他正经历一场很糟糕的离婚
"Who, to be fair, was going through a bad divorce

336
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:40,126
他还喜欢通过撒谎来吸引人们的注意
and had a habit of lying to get attention."

337
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:42,045
我恨这份工作 桑迪
I hate this job, Sandy!

338
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,264
我投身新闻事业是为了有所改变
I went into journalism to make a difference,

339
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,800
但你让这变得不可能
but you have made that impossible.

340
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,718
你知道吗 老实说 我这几个月过的
You know, to be honest, it hasn't been

341
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,687
一直不顺 我犯了不少错误
an easy couple months for me. I've made mistakes.

342
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,106
我感到孤独 我要让那些我甚至都不知道我有的
I've felt alone. I had to let go of dreams

343
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:54,724
梦想离我而去
I didn't even know I had.

344
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:56,943
所以你给我听好
So here's the deal:

345
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:58,344
你要继续直播
You're gonna get back on air

346
00:14:58,346 --> 00:14:59,979
把我们倒数到更好的一年
and count us into a better year,

347
00:14:59,981 --> 00:15:04,567
因为我不能再呆在2011了 你听到了吗
because I just can't do 2011 anymore. You with me?

348
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,986
他根本没听 是不是
He's not with me, is he?

349
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:15,423
总之 爸爸 我当时在哪
Anyway, Dad, where was I?

350
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,368
知道吗 好 滚出去
You know what? Fine, get out of here!

351
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,620
我们不需要你们
We don't need ya!

352
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:24,425
为什么没人喜欢这些帽子
And why doesn't anybody like these hats?

353
00:15:24,427 --> 00:15:28,429
我做的这些帽子
I made these hats.

354
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:30,097
因为它们是湿的 道格
It's because they' wet, Doug.

355
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:32,716
他们为什么都湿了
Why are they all wet?!

356
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:34,835
那些是我们最后的客人吗
Were those our last customers?

357
00:15:34,837 --> 00:15:36,854
我去看看卫生间
Let me go check the bathroom.

358
00:15:41,277 --> 00:15:43,527
你一定是护送服务的
You must be from the escort service.

359
00:15:45,013 --> 00:15:50,734
本来设想的是高中摔跤比赛
The scenario is high school wrestling match.

360
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:55,188
你好
Hello?

361
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,791
听听这个 我把桑迪 里弗斯弄丢了
So get this: I lost Sandy Rivers.

362
00:15:57,793 --> 00:15:59,793
有趣的是你应该早说
Funny you should mention that.

363
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:00,861
马上就要午夜了
It's almost midnight!

364
00:16:00,863 --> 00:16:02,880
我该怎么做 自己上直播
What am I gonna do, go on the air myself?

365
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:06,050
听着 等一下 好极了 就这么干
Listen... Wait. Yeah, do that!

366

不 实际上我不能
No, I-I can't actually.

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,554
不 你能 这就是你真正想要的也是你应得的

凯文 事情不是那么运作的
Kevin, that's not how it works.

369
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:13,974
听上去那是你唯一的选择
Sounds like that's your only choice.

370
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:16,060
纽约是个大城市
New York's a big city.

桑迪 里弗斯可能在任何地方

372
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:22,416
预备 开摔
And... wrestle!

373

嘿
Hey.

374
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:28,388
对不起 宝贝
I'm sorry, baby.

375
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,074
我只是 我希望我们的孩子
I just... I want our kid

相信宇宙是魔幻的
to believe that the universe is magical.

377
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:34,445
你知道 就像我爸爸教我的那样
You know, like my dad taught me.

378
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:36,363
你知道我爸爸教我什么了吗
You know what my dad taught me?

379
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:38,615
什么也没教 因为他从来不在我身边
Nothing... 'cause he was never there.

被花在了一个叫做
"Has been spent on a board game called

384

谁偷了看孩子的钱的桌游
Who Stole The Babysitting Money?"

385

他始终看不出来这里面的讽刺
He never saw the irony in that.

说 好极了 谢谢 然后挂掉了他的电话
says, 'Great. Thanks,' and hangs up on her."

389
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:12,099
在促使她给他打电话后

在他丈夫的嘴里发现了一只大脚怪
a Big Foot is discovered in her husband's mouth.

我很高兴你相信这些 宝贝
I'm glad you're a believer, baby,

392
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:24,661
但我永远不会相信谜团团
but I'm never gonna believe in an "Enigma of the mystical"

393
00:17:24,663 --> 00:17:27,831
除非我亲眼看到
unless I see it with my own eyes.

394
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,750
因为实际上
Because the truth is,

395
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:34,254
我爸爸从不教我相信任何事 除了我自己
my father never taught me believe in anything but myself.

396
00:17:34,256 --> 00:17:38,092
那么 如果有用的话 我也相信你
Well, if it helps at all, I believe in you, too.

397
00:17:39,978 --> 00:17:43,013
那么很有可能我是不存在的
Then there's a pretty good chance I don't exist.

398

你胆子不小
How dare you?!

今晚我被人吃了豆腐 踩到了呕吐物
tonight I've been groped, stepped in puke

10分钟以前我都没想到能在全国电视台上出镜
and until 10 minutes ago I had no idea I would be on national television

404
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:04,718
果然是我认识的罗宾
That's my girl.

405
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,006
不过这就是新年到来的神奇之处
But that's the magic of New Year's.

当时针指向零点午夜的时候

我们就会迎来一个全新的开始
we all get a fresh start.

00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:14,595
我虽然不知道大家会如何 但我肯定会有一个好的开始
And I don't know about you, but I could really use one.

409
00:18:14,597 --> 00:18:18,465
这个神奇的时刻就会发生在十
And that magic moment starts in ten...

九
nine...

411
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:23,487
那夜也变成了罗宾职业路上得一个转折点
That night became a turning point in Robin's career.

412
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:28,392
不过这个我们以后再说
But we'll get to that.

413
00:18:29,477 --> 00:18:31,028
这些帽子很可爱啊 道格
They're nice hats, Doug.

414
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,014
他们虽然是湿的不过好看啊
They're wet but they're nice.

三 二 一
...three, two, one.

416
00:18:41,206 --> 00:18:43,073
这就是新年前夜的一段故事
And that's the story of New Year's Eve.

417
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:44,958
我最近一直在思考 你知道么
You know, I've been thinking

418
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,628
我跟莉莉的关系非常紧张的原因是
that the reason I got so intense with Lily

419
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,131
有关于谜团团这本书 那个
about Enigmas of the Mystical is that, well...

420
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:53,250
你能递给我那罐酸菜么
Could you pass the pickles?

421
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,921
随着你的离开 我感觉谜团团并没有那么的神秘了
...with you gone, I feel the mystical a little less.

422
00:18:57,923 --> 00:19:00,090
你能递给我那包薯片么
Can you hand me the chips?

423
00:19:00,092 --> 00:19:02,926
而且有时候我我觉得我想起您的时候更少了
Sometimes I feel you a little less.

424
00:19:02,928 --> 00:19:06,713
这就是为什么今天那么的重要
That's why today was so important because I just...

425
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:07,881
我需要跟
I needed to...

426
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:14,905
你是刚刚用我爸的墓碑开了你的瓶酒么
Did you just open a beer on my father's headstone?

427
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:16,406
其实 这支是苹果酒(酒精低于10%)
Actually, it's a hard cider.

428
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:19,660
正当他感觉到要失控的时候
And just as he was about to lose it...

429
00:19:19,662 --> 00:19:21,445
嘿 马文 你能递给我个汉堡么
Hey, Marvin, can you pass me a burger?

430
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:22,863
噢 不是马文 是马修
Hey, not Marvin. Marshall.

431
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:25,232
不好意思 只是 只是你跟你老爸非常的像
Sorry, it's just, you're so much like your pop.

432
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:27,835
你们的马修叔叔又想到
Your Uncle Marshall thought back

433

那些在车后挡板与父亲一起的故事
to all those tailgates with his father.

434
00:19:31,572 --> 00:19:33,406
嘿 你介意我拿一个走么
Hey, mind if I grab one?

435
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:35,909
-拿的越多我越高兴   -那敢情好
-The more the merrier!   -All right.

436
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:40,536
时间会慢慢愈合我们的伤口
The time has come to heal our wounds

437
00:19:40,537 --> 00:19:43,383
这个时刻就要来临 即将来临
The time has come, it's coming soon...

438
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,061
他意识到他对于自己所认为的私人空间看得太重了
And he realized that maybe private moments are overrated.

439
00:19:54,063 --> 00:19:55,312
我告诉你
You know what?

440
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,365
你拿得越多越好
The more the merrier.

441
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,034

新年快乐
Happy New Year.
