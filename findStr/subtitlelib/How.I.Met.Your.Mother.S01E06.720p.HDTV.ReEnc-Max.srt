OLDER TED: You know how Aunt Robin's
a big fan of Halloween?

3
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:18,079
Always dressing up in crazy costumes?

4
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:19,831
Well, she wasn't always that way.

5
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:23,464
Back in 2005, she thought she was
too cool for Halloween.

6

7

- Our costumes?

8

- Do they rule?
- They rule.

13

It's the one night of the year chicks use
to unleash their inner ho-bag.

14
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:45,767
If a girl dresses up as a witch,
she's a slutty witch.

15
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:48,539
If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat.

16
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:51,719
- Lf she's a nurse...
- Wow. We get it.

17

Oh, I don't know.

You have a boyfriend
and you haven't told us?

23
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:04,470
No. I mean, he's not my boyfriend.

24
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,465
He's just this guy I've been seeing
for a couple of weeks.

25

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,982
So why haven't we met him?

27

We're not really ready to go public yet.

28

Married.

29
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:17,557
How about we go
on a Halloween double-date?

30
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:19,533
I don't know, we were kind of thinking
about staying at home...

31
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:22,226
and dressing up as naked people.

32
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:25,204
Come on, Robin, trot out your new fella.

33
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:27,338
Let us judge and evaluate him
behind your back.

34
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,343
It'll be fun.

what happened?

36
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:33,073
- Your costumes came?
- Our costumes... Yes.

That is why we're best friends.

39

- Well...
- What?

40
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:41,676
Every Halloween,
Ted waits for the slutty pumpkin.

41
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:42,696
That's right.

42

What's the slutty pumpkin?

43
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,264
You mean, 'Who is the slutty pumpkin?'

44
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,269

47

<i>appeared this girl
in the sexiest pumpkin costume.</i>

48
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:59,615
Wait, how can a pumpkin costume
be sexy?

49
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,470
It was carved in strategic places.

50
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:04,840
<i>TED: So, we're at the
bar and I see her mix...</i>

51
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,465
- Kahlúa and...
- Kahlúa and root beer.

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,217
A cocktail she invented herself.

53
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:10,065
- And she...
- And she called it the Tootsie Roll.

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,116
- Because...
- ALL: Because it tastes...

So we had this instant connection.

58
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:18,222

68
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:41,449
- Loves them.
- Oh, good.

69
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,329
I don't know why people
are so cynical about Ewoks.

70
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,813
The Rebellion would've failed
without the Ewoks.

71

And get this. She's a marine biologist.

72

studying penguins.

78

the slutty pumpkin.

Ladies and gentlemen,

174
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:27,985
as on pitch as they were at Spring Fling '95,

175
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,948
it's my pleasure to welcome back
The Shagarats.

179
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:56,536
What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater?

180
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:59,021
Argyle.

181
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,059
And what be a pirate's...

182
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:06,530
favorite fast food restaurant?

183
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,280
Arby's.

184
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:12,821
'Twould think it would be Arby's.

185
00:08:12,882 --> 00:08:15,885
But actually it's Long John Silver's.

186
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,369
Actually, I kind of need this hand to eat.

187
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,588
Oh, yeah.

188
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:24,735
(GRUNTING)...

189
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,347
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm starving.

190
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:32,955
It's so nice to meet you, Mike.
You guys are really cute together.

191
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,281
Yeah. We've been spending
a lot of time together.

192
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:38,818
We're even getting to that point
where we finish each other's...

193
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,857
- This cheeseburger is so...
- Good.

194
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,862
See?

195
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,986
I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby.

196
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:49,619
This steak totally bitch-slapped
my pork chops.

197
00:08:49,714 --> 00:08:50,957
That may be true.

198
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:54,812
But your rice pilaf
kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard,

199
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,937
it threw up a little bit.

200
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,555
Robin, you have to try this chicken.

201
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,327
Oh, no, that's good. I'm okay. Thanks.

202
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:06,410
It's really tasty.

203
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,914
I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.

204
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,304
Come on, just try a little bite.

205
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,240
Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.

206
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,854
Oh, for God's sakes.

207
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:24,155

- Hey.
- Hey.

211
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,177
So, what does a fella have to do
to get lei-ed around here?

212
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:48,052
Yeah.

213
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:51,072
Right.'Cause I'm wearing a lei.

214
00:09:51,303 --> 00:09:52,259
God.

215
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:54,904
It isn't funny if you explain the joke.

(SCOFFS)...

217
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,937
- Let's bail.
- No, Barney, come on. I'm having fun.

218
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:02,869
Plus, it's really great
to see all these guys again.

219
00:10:02,964 --> 00:10:05,195
Name one person you know at this party.

220
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,200
Well, there's Ninja,

221
00:10:07,903 --> 00:10:10,006
Back of Horse.
Hey, where's Front of Horse?

222
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:12,617
That guy's a riot, where is he?

223
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:14,877
Okay, I'm leaving.

224
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:18,064
But just know that
this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht.

225
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,390
And what will be sticking to that yacht?

226
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:22,395
The Barnacle.

227
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:25,105
- Really? That's the nickname now?
- Yeah, the Barnacle.

228
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,392
- The Barnacle?
- That's it.

229
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,151
Barnacle out.

230
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:31,156
Have fun, Barnacle.

231
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:35,300
So, do you like Mike?

232
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:36,766
Do you like Mike?

233
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:38,646
Of course I do. Why?

234
00:10:38,742 --> 00:10:40,239
It just doesn't seem like it.

235
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,597
You won't share your food,
you won't wear a costume.

236
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:46,134
Oh, Lily, you know me.
I'm just not into all that coupley stuff.

237
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,511
Okay, I know that stuff
looks dumb from the outside.

238
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,920
But it's kind of the greatest thing
in the world when you're a part of it.

239
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:55,309
If you just gave it a chance,
you might like it.

240
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,209
Are you trying to get me to join a cult?

241
00:10:58,305 --> 00:10:59,802
Robin, Mike likes you.

242
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:02,543
If you don't start meeting him halfway,
you're gonna lose him.

243
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:03,689
What?

244
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,346
Look, it's Halloween.

245
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:07,385
Just put on the girlfriend costume
for a night.

246
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,484
Okay. Well, what am I supposed to do?

247
00:11:11,113 --> 00:11:13,885
Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?

248
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,146
How about you start by sharing dessert.

249
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:19,110
I can share dessert.

250
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:21,115
Good.

251
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,902
He better want the brownie sundae.

252
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:26,406
But, yeah.
Yeah, I can totally share. Yeah.

00:11:32,655 --> 00:11:35,077
- Barney? What, you're back?
- That's right.

256
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:37,202
In a totally new costume.

257
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,889
Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume...

258
00:11:39,984 --> 00:11:42,310
in case I strike out
with the hottest girl at the party.

259
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:46,484
That way I have a second chance
to make a first impression.

260
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,662
What's with the face?

261
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:50,371
It's half 'you're pathetic,'
half 'I have to pee.'

262
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:51,454
So go to the bathroom.

263
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,131
No, there's a huge line.
I don't wanna miss the slutty pumpkin.

264
00:11:54,226 --> 00:11:56,136
So pee off the roof.

265
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:57,540
Ted, pee off the roof.

266
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:00,885
Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
There's people waIking down there.

Come on, Ted.
Who are you gonna listen to?

268
00:12:03,338 --> 00:12:06,017
Me or Mr. Goody-Goody over there?

269
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,616
Yeah, whatever. You guys got some weed?

even come close to ours.

00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:20,893
Take the damn picture.

276
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:23,539
- Got it.
- Nice.

277
00:12:23,634 --> 00:12:25,674
I still think we should've won
as Sonny and Cher.

278
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,127
Maybe if I'd worn the red dress.

279
00:12:28,223 --> 00:12:30,495
If I could turn back time...

280
00:12:32,014 --> 00:12:35,646
Wow. This sundae looks so good,
I could eat the whole thing.

281
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:40,904
But I would much rather share this small,
one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.

Every guy's used the lei-ed line
on you tonight, huh?

287

we found this little Italian place...

No, you found it. I came with you.

298
00:13:29,514 --> 00:13:31,266
But go on.

We're crazy for the stuff.

I'm crazy and you're crazy...

303
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,269
for tiramisu.

304
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:43,470
We love tiramisu.

305
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:44,745
Am I wrong saying that?

306
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,835
No, no, no. I mean,
it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it?

loving tiramisu?

Right?

Easy there, hungry.

312
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:10,576
Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.

- Where?

- Nope.

watching my delusional friend...

She might.

Come on, Barney,
this is not about the odds.

322
00:14:39,482 --> 00:14:40,471

00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:00,057

those bread crumbs...

00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,285
back to my place, Hansel.

337
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:20,802
Robin, I don't get the sense
you like being with me.

338
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:22,108
I like being with you.

339
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:23,862
Not as much as you like being alone.

340
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,996
You like eating your own food,

doing your own crosswords.

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:31,795
Sorry.

Okay, I'm a bit set in my ways.

That doesn't mean that this won't work.

346
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,015
Actually, it kind of does.

347
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,015
Wait, are we breaking up?

00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,521
No, we aren't breaking up.

349
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,269
I'm breaking up with you.

<i>Could this penguin be the slutty pumpkin?</i>

354
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:15,079
Excuse me?

355
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,385
This is gonna sound crazy,

356
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:19,381
but I met someone up on this roof
four years ago...

357
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:23,778
and they mixed that cocktail,
and they loved penguins.

358
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:26,242
By any chance, was that you?

359
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:30,310
It's you.

360
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:34,643
- Everyone thought I was crazy, but I...
- You are such a loser.

361
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:36,937
Come on, I came back for you, Ted.

362
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,922

to show you the error of your ways.

And to score Hula Girl's number.
Check and check.

364
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:46,284
- Unbelievable.
- Yes, it is.

365
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:49,014
Wait a minute.

366
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,512
You're that lame army guy.

367
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,634
No, no, that's some other guy.
And he was a kick-ass fighter pilot.

368
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,036
I cannot believe I gave you my number.

369
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:56,183
Yeah, well, you did. Thanks.

370
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:57,234
Yeah, well, give it back.

371
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,516
Well, I don't think so. I earned it.
Fair and square. I'm calling you.

372
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:02,811
But I'm never gonna go out with you.

373
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:07,370
But how will you know it's me?
I'm a master of disguise.

374
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,183
Yeah.

00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:13,675
Nice.

377
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:16,702
Come on, Ted. Victoria's Secret party.
Now. Let's go.

378
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:19,719
- I'm staying.
- Fine. Fine.

379
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:21,736
What are you doing?

380
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,741
I'm flippering you off.

381
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,638
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

382
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:30,912
Seriously, it's not a big deal.

383
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,672
He wanted to be a 'we'
and I wanted to be an 'I.'

Dudes are such chicks.

385
00:17:38,495 --> 00:17:40,184
You guys, I'm fine.

386
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,956
Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in.

387
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:46,588
And the winners
of this year's costume contest are

388
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,437
Lily Aldrin as a parrot,

389
00:17:48,532 --> 00:17:50,284
and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate.

390
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,578
Oh, yeah! Wait, what did he say?

391
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,075
Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won.

392
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:57,007
Wait. Gay pirate?
Where are you getting that from?

393
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:58,632
Dude, you're wearing eyeliner.

394
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:02,391
Okay, I just want everybody here to know
I'm not a gay pirate.

395
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:04,239
I have sex with my parrot all the time.

396
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:06,244
That came out wrong.

397
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,594
Oh, yeah, doesn't matter! We won!

398
00:18:09,624 --> 00:18:13,129
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- I love you, too, Lilypad.

399
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,741
You guys, let me get a picture.

400
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:31,094
I had a feeling I'd find you here.

401
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,099
Oh, hey.

402
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:36,112
If you're here for The Shagarats,
you just missed the fourth encore.

If you're here for The Shagarats,
you just missed the fourth encore.

but peach schnapps.

00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:46,292
I played tennis in high school.

408
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:47,439
You know why?

409
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:52,537
Because it was just me out there.
I couldn't even stand playing doubles.

410
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,543
I just got dumped.

411
00:18:54,544 --> 00:18:56,454
Oh, man, that sucks.

412
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:59,258
It's okay. I wasn't that into him.

Everyone else is off falling in love...

415
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:07,958
and acting stupid and goofy
and sweet and insane, but not me.

416
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:09,679
Why don't I want that more?

417
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,684
I want to want that.

418
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:14,944
- Am I wired wrong or something?
- No.

419
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:20,734
Look, you didn't want to be with me,
so clearly, you have abysmal taste in men.

420
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,021
But you're wired just fine.

421
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,906
Well, what if I'm just a cold person.

00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:30,962
Tonight, Mike was willing
to look like a complete idiot for me,

423
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:33,087
but I couldn't be Gretel.

424
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:35,136
Why can't I be Gretel?

425
00:19:35,232 --> 00:19:37,940
Because you just haven't met
the right Hansel yet.

426
00:19:38,035 --> 00:19:39,279
Hey, one day you're gonna meet a guy...

427

who's gonna make you wanna look
like a complete idiot.

428
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:45,045
- Really?
- Yeah, he's out there somewhere.

429
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:46,670
Just like the slutty pumpkin.

How do you do this, Ted?

432
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:54,890
How do you sit out here all night
on the roof, in the cold,

433
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,790
and still have faith
your pumpkin's gonna show up?

434
00:19:57,886 --> 00:19:59,795
Well, I'm pretty drunk.

through that door in a pumpkin costume...

at 2:43 in the morning.

00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:17,230
