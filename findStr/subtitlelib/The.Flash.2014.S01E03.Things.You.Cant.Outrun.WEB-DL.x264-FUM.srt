1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,504
- My name is barry allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:08,040
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,975
By something impossible.
- Run, barry, run!

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:13,012
- My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:17,449
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,852
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,021
But secretly I use my speed

8
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,590
To fight crime
and find others like me.

9
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:27,359
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,161
And get justice for my father.

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,498
I am...The flash.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,533
<i>Previously on the flash...</i>

13
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,268
- I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,437
But you really did see something
that night your mom died

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,172
<i>And your dad is innocent.</i>

16
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:43,509
- The explosion that put you
in a coma also killed my fiance.

17
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,677
- Can you imagine if
you could control his power?

18
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,046
If you could harness it,

19
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,515
You could change
what it means to be human.

20
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,216
- He's called the flash.

21
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,653
Or, at least,
he will be one day.

22
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,690
- He must be kept safe.

23
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,064
- It doesn't matter
if you're the slowest kid

24
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,366
In gym class
or the fastest man alive.

25
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:11,170
Every one of us is running.

26
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:12,438
Being alive means running--

27
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,039
Running from something,

28
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,541
Running to something

29
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:17,543
Or someone.

30
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,545
And no matter how fast you are,

31
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,547
There's some things
you can't outrun.

32
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:25,517
Some things always manage
to catch up to you.

33
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,220
Regular movie scale,
that was a seven or an eight.

34
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:31,356
Zombie movie scale,
it was, like, a four, tops.

35
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,092
- There's a zombie movie scale?

36
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:35,494
- Did you know that zombies
exist in nature?

37
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:38,430
There's a species of fungi
that infects ants,

38
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,399
Causing the ants
to attack plants

39
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,768
That can release spores
which in turn infect new hosts.

40
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,203
I'm going full nerd again,
aren't I?

41
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,337
- Yep.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:46,772
- Yeah.
It's okay though.

43
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,874
You are still the cutest nerd
that I know.

44
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,609
Anyways,
I'm a lot more interested

45
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,177
In the amazing as of late.

46
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,113
- You mean 'cause of
this "streak" thing?

47
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,948
- He's out there.
People are talking about him.

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,216
- How do you even know
he's a he?

49
00:01:57,218 --> 00:01:58,250
Maybe it's a she.

50
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,985
- It's a man, okay?

51
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,254
You know I am really intuitive
about this kind of stuff.

52
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,622
Someone even posted a picture

53
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,224
After being yanked
from a car accident.

54
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,925
It's a red blur
leaving the scene.

55
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,394
Here, what do you see?

56
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,099
- I see
your boyfriend's calling.

57
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,501
- Oh,
I should probably get this.

58
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,169
I'm crashing at his place
tonight,

59
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:19,138
And he's supposed to leave
a key for me somewhere.

60
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,839
Hey, babe.
What's up?

61
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,308
Not much,
just hanging out with barry.

62
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,309
You off yet?

63
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,413
- Hello.

64
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:30,682
- Code 237 on waid boulevard.

65
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,484
- Public indecency?

66
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:34,219
- Wait, I think I meant a 239.

67
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,155
- Dog leash violation?

68
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,790
- Bad man with a gun
in a getaway car.

69
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,492
Go.

70
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,162
- You don't have a mat.
Do you have a planter?

71
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,508
- He's got a gun.
Look out!

72
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,749
Where'd he go?

73
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,622
What the--

74
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:11,857
- Key's in the mailbox.

75
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,526
I'll see you later.
Bye.

76
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,361
Eddie says hi.
- Nice of him.

77
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,696
You wanna grab a bite?

78
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,498
I'm feeling a little famished.

79
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,667
- After the mongolian barbecue
we had before the movie

80
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,535
And the extra large popcorn
you had at the movie?

81
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,871
How are you not fat?

82
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,974
- I've been jogging.

83
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,209
- Oh, okay.

84
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,915
- Why so public a meeting,
uncle?

85
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,319
- We're dining out to show
our enemies we're not afraid.

86
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,987
Relax, nephew.

87
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,224
We've replaced the windows
with bulletproof glass.

88
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,491
Close it up.

89
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,492
Come.

90
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:48,727
Have a drink.

91
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:04,710
Our own drivers
are ripping us off.

92
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,412
Someone is paying them

93
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,215
To steal from us.

94
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:14,753
None of you will sleep
until we find out who.

95
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,955
And then those thieves...

96
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,725
Those thieves...

97
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:23,128
Will draw

98
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,429
Their last breath.

99
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,534
- Uncle!

100
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,554
- Where'd you cut him off?
- So we cut him off at eighth.

101
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:51,523
I mean, the perp was in
the backseat of the cruiser

102
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:52,891
Before he even knew
what happened.

103
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,059
- Congratulations, paulson,

104
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,527
On that arrest last night.

105
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,195
Hell of a job.
- You come by later, joe.

106
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:59,898
I'll give you a driving lesson,
okay?

107
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,000
- Wasn't even him last night.
It was me.

108
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,135
- I figured.

109
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,436
I just didn't realize

110
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,038
You were helping people
for the glory.

111
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,707
- It's not like I want a museum
built in my name.

112
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,343
Keeping what I can do a secret
from iris and everyone,

113
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,678
It's harder than I thought.

114
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,546
- I know,
but it is safer that way.

115
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:17,382
Besides, me and you
got work to do.

116
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,987
- The evidence
from my mom's case.

117
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,689
- I had it brought up
from storage.

118
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,590
- I've been through this box
1,000 times.

119
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:29,361
- Before, your story about what
really happened that night--

120
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,330
The lightning storm,
the man in the middle of it--

121
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,764
I thought that was a kid

122
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,499
Trying to protect his father
from prison.

123
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,101
But now that I know it's true,

124
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,937
We're gonna go through
every scrap of evidence

125
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,539
Until we find something
that helps us.

126
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,541
- It took the jury 52 minutes
to come back

127
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,809
With a verdict of guilty.

128
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,844
- They moved too fast,

129
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,713
Which is why we got to
take our time.

130
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,384
- Barry, joe,
we got multiple homicides.

131
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,920
Do you know
the darbinyan crime family?

132
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,429
- Barry?

133
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,565
Ah.
Anything?

134
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,067
- Signs of histotoxic hypoxia.

135
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,037
The cells in their bodies
were unable to utilize oxygen.

136
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,439
It's consistent with exposure
to poison gas.

137
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,841
- What kind of poison?

138
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,209
- I'll need to take
a lung sample,

139
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,944
See if I can narrow it down.

140
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:22,381
- The only other exit was bolted
from the inside.

141
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,015
They were trapped.

142
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,451
I was thinking someone
pumped gas in from the outside,

143
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,887
But witnesses say
the street was empty.

144
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,522
- So it was from the inside.

145
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,190
That means there should be
a canister

146
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,226
Or a container left behind.

147
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,428
The gas just didn't
come in by itself.

148
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,597
- Unless it had
a mind of its own.

149
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,770
- Eddie, would you mind
canvassing again?

150
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:47,439
Somebody had to have seen
something suspicious.

151
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,443
Okay, explain.

152
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,045
- The boss collapsed
by the table.

153
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,914
This guy made it 10 feet away.

154
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,382
That guy had a chance
to move off

155
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:58,784
And fire three shots
into the window

156
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,185
Trying to break the glass.

157
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,387
But they all started
in the same spot,

158
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:04,589
Which means they should have
all been affected by the gas

159
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,291
At the same time, but instead,
it's as if...

160
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,127
- They were attacked one by one.

161
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:12,564
My gut feeling,
if we're gonna solve this one,

162
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,299
You and me are gonna need...

163
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,836
Backup.
- Yeah.

164
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,505
- Fascinating, a meta-human
that can manipulate poison gas.

165
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,907
- Is it just poisonous gas,

166
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,608
Or can he control
all aerated substances?

167
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,744
- And how is he able
to formulate the connection?

168
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,646
Is it physiological
or psychological?

169
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,080
- This individual can create

170
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,749
A mental nexus
using gaseous substances.

171
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,751
- You mean connect with gases
on a molecular level?

172
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,219
- Yes.
- That is ridiculously cool.

173
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:35,921
- They get really excited
about this stuff.

174
00:07:35,923 --> 00:07:37,255
- The only thing
I'm excited about

175
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,057
Is putting criminals
behind bars.

176
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,660
Except iron heights
isn't exactly equipped

177
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43,228
To handle meta-humans.

178
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,896
- Then I guess it's fortunate
the ones

179
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,431
You've encountered so far
are no longer with us.

180
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,400
- Well, unless we're planning
on executing

181
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,669
Every super criminal we stop,

182
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,270
You geniuses are gonna have to
come up

183
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,172
With someplace else
to hold them.

184
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:57,075
- A meta-human prison.
Sweet.

185
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,911
- Until we figure a way
to remove their powers.

186
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:04,549
- There is one place here
that might hold them.

187
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,017
- You can't be serious.

188
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,653
I mean, we haven't been
down there since--

189
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,988
It's cordoned off.

190
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,989
- Cisco is right.

191
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:11,990
It could be modified to act

192
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,158
As a makeshift prison.

193
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,227
- What could?

194
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:16,928
- The particle accelerator.

195
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,536
Tonight, the future begins.

196
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,805
The work my team and I
will do here

197
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,307
Will change our understanding
of physics,

198
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,510
Will bring about
advancements in power,

199
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,745
Advancements in medicine.

200
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:35,580
And trust me,
that future

201
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,316
Will be here faster
than you think.

202
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,652
- Dr. Wells, we just got
the latest weather report.

203
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,121
A big thunderstorm
is rolling in.

204
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,656
- We're not launching
a space shuttle.

205
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:48,393
We'll be fine.

206
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,895
- Tahiti?

207
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,530
- I know it's a long flight,
ronnie,

208
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,465
<i>But we can binge watch
orange is the new black.</i>

209
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:54,699
- Oh, okay.

210
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,535
But what about Italy?

211
00:08:56,537 --> 00:09:00,505
Pizza and wine and more pizza.

212
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,208
- Yes, but Italy
doesn't have mai tais,

213
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,910
And a honeymoon
isn't a honeymoon

214
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,645
Without mai tais.

215
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,580
- Dr. Wells,
the accelerator is primed

216
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,148
And ready
for particle injection.

217
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,019
- Well, I feel I should
say something profound

218
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:18,690
Like "one small step for man,"

219
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,926
But all I can think of
to say is,

220
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:23,261
I feel like I've waited
for this day for centuries.

221
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,974
- That's it?

222
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:38,310
You'd think there'd be, like,
a loud bang.

223
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,378
- If there was a loud bang,
we'd all be in big trouble.

224
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,414
- Take it from the guy
who helped build it.

225
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,750
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we did it.

226
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,724
- Mai tais it is.

227
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:10,709
- Was that...

228
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:14,646
- A loud bang.

229
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:17,649
- Caitlin.

230
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,984
Caitlin.

231
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,619
Did you hear me?

232
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,555
We're going down
to the accelerator ring.

233
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,757
- Actually, dr. Wells,
I could use caitlin's help

234
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,593
Identifying the poison gas.

235
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,063
- Okay.

236
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,465
- If that's okay with you?

237
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,001
- Let's go.

238
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,611
- Welcome to the ccpd.

239
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:47,846
- So this is your day job.

240
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,247
- Mm-hmm.

241
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:50,482
- I'm gonna rip out your hearts

242
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,017
And eat 'em for lunch.

243
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,451
- Delightful.

244
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,755
- Lab rat, I need prints
off this gun pronto.

245
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,590
- Allen!

246
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,759
Where the hell is the fiber
analysis on the orloff case?

247
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,294
- Upstairs.
It's all finished.

248
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,829
I can just run up
and bring it down.

249
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,564
- With you, that could be
three days from now.

250
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,199
I'll go with you.
Who are you?

251
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,068
- Dr. Caitlin snow,

252
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,970
Barry's personal physician.

253
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,076
- The fiber analysis
for the orloff case,

254
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:19,644
Like you asked for,

255
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:21,579
Sir.

256
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,250
- Clean up your lab.

257
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,751
It's a mess.

258
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:34,526
- The lightning
was in the house.

259
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,794
I told my son to run,

260
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:37,662
He disappeared,

261
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,231
And that's when
I saw the blood.

262
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,866
- Your prints were
on the murder weapon.

263
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,502
- I needed
to stabilize the knife.

264
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,237
I'm a doctor.

265
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:49,007
I was trying to save her.

266
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,308
I didn't kill my wife.

267
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,078
Joe, tell them.

268
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,913
You know me.
Our kids are friends.

269
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,448
You tell them, joe.

270
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:01,519
- Do I even want to know
what you were looking at?

271
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,254
- It's just work.

272
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,958
Some old cases
weren't filed properly.

273
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,769
- Detective.
What are you doing here?

274
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,304
- Joe, I thought
you were at the morgue.

275
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:22,474
- I decided
to bring some work home.

276
00:12:22,476 --> 00:12:24,209
Why are you here?

277
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:28,613
- Yes, well,
I've been looking for you.

278
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,615
I thought maybe we could
go back to the crime scene,

279
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:33,618
Re-canvass,
see if we missed anything.

280
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,053
Always work the case, right?

281
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,588
That's what you taught me.

282
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,923
- Wow, you've been listening.

283
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,792
Okay, let's hit it.

284
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,727
- You mind
if I use your bathroom?

285
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,262
- It's the first door
on the right.

286
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,464
I'll be in the car.

287
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:47,966
Bye, baby.

288
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,367
- Bye, dad.

289
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,473
- Okay, this has got to stop.

290
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,142
I came here
to surprise my girlfriend,

291
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:59,644
And now I'm going
to a crime scene with her dad--

292
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,479
Not exactly the afternoon
I was planning on.

293
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,814
- I know, I know,
it's just--

294
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,182
It's not the right time
to tell him.

295
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,551
- When is, iris?

296
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,087
- I know my dad.
He'll kill us.

297
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,991
- Right now,
you're killing us.

298
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,140
- The copper in the tube
is arranged to form cavities,

299
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:33,678
And we can use those cavities
as containment cells.

300
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,715
Of course, we'll have to
design them to counteract

301
00:13:37,717 --> 00:13:40,552
Meta-human abilities, but--

302
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,687
Might just work.

303
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,789
First, we have to decouple
the main injection system

304
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,790
On the gantry level.

305
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,025
I'll be right back.

306
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,760
- Why don't I do that?

307
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:50,428
- I need the exercise.

308
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,205
- There's an anomaly
in the core chamber.

309
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,106
- The ring's
structural integrity is holding.

310
00:14:02,108 --> 00:14:03,675
- It's started a chain reaction.

311
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,610
The system is collapsing.
We need to shut it down.

312
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,078
- We can't ramp down
the accelerator from here.

313
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,413
We need to do it manually.
- Go.

314
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,614
- I'll come with.
- Ronnie, no.

315
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,082
- I'm the lead engineer.

316
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,717
I know how to operate
the shutdown valve.

317
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,753
- It's not safe.
- Cait, I have to go.

318
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,897
Okay, you stay here.

319
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:27,999
We've only got a few minutes
before this thing blows,

320
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,235
And if I'm not back in time,
you need to initiate lockdown.

321
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:32,036
- No way.
I am not closing this door.

322
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,538
I won't be able
to open it again.

323
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,106
- Cisco, if you don't seal off
the blast,

324
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,608
Everyone in this building
will die,

325
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,043
Including caitlin.

326
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,511
Okay, now promise me.

327
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:45,116
Set your watch.

328
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,184
Two minutes.

329
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,757
- You're coming back.

330
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,148
- Cisco.

331
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,050
Cisco, we're ready to go.

332
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:27,392
Must be hard,
coming back down here.

333
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,394
A lot happened that night.

334
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,628
If you feel the need to talk--

335
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,563
- I was just thinking,

336
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:34,832
We need to nail
those voltage calculations.

337
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,901
One fault,
and the helium blowback

338
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:39,771
Could damage the mountings.

339
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,739
- Smart.

340
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,281
- Can I ask you something

341
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,849
That you don't have to answer?

342
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,018
- My least favorite
kind of question.

343
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,220
Shoot.

344
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,992
- Ronnie.
What was he like?

345
00:16:00,994 --> 00:16:05,129
You just never talk about him
that much.

346
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,166
- We met when we were working
on the particle accelerator.

347
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,568
He was the structural engineer.

348
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,036
He liked to joke
that he was basically

349
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,138
A very high-priced plumber.

350
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,544
We were very different.

351
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,046
You might have noticed
I can be a bit...

352
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:23,815
Guarded.

353
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,917
Ronnie knew how
to make me laugh.

354
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,954
He used to say we were
like fire and ice.

355
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:36,961
He wasn't supposed to be there
that night.

356
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,330
He was just there for me.

357
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,565
If he hadn't--

358
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,639
This says that there was
no residue of gas in the tissue,

359
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,541
Poisonous or otherwise.

360
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,744
- It must have evaporated.

361
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,045
We'll need to get
a fresh sample.

362
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,047
- Wait, this can't be right.

363
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,017
This says that there are
two distinct strands of dna

364
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,419
Inside the tissue.

365
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:04,122
- How did someone else's dna
get inside the victim's lungs?

366
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,628
- Well, my docket was clear,
so I stopped by the mall

367
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:13,131
To pick up
your homecoming dress.

368
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,566
<i>I am a great mom.</i>

369
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,635
I'll see you for dinner,
sweetie.

370
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,809
- There's no dna match
in the database.

371
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,077
- I don't understand.

372
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,879
Why would a chemical attack

373
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:32,417
Leave behind another person's
dna inside the victim?

374
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,085
- What if the meta-human
we're looking for

375
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:36,254
Doesn't control gas?

376
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,423
What if he becomes it?

377
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,737
- Judge howard.

378
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,440
It's nice to see you again.

379
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,974
- You died.

380
00:17:56,976 --> 00:18:00,111
- You say that like
it was an accident.

381
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,813
You remember the last thing
you said to me

382
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,448
In the courtroom?

383
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,785
<i>May god have mercy
on your soul.</i>

384
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,999
- All available units,
we have a report

385
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:23,334
Of a toxic gas attack

386
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,702
In the central city
shopping mall.

387
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,838
- Barry, don't.

388
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,341
We don't know enough
about what we're facing yet.

389
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,542
It's not safe.

390
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,078
- Caitlin, I have to go.

391
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,028
- I patched into
the mall's security system.

392
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,630
According to witnesses,
the gas attack

393
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:54,665
Was in the main elevator
in the north wing.

394
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,000
- Which one is the north wing?

395
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,637
- The one
with the big belly burger.

396
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,539
I eat.

397
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,975
- Back up.
Please, keep back.

398
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,762
- Why did you kill that woman?

399
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,371
She deserved to die.

400
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,773
Now go run away.

401
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,143
I still have one more name
on my list.

402
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:42,280
Don't make me add you to it.

403
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,437
- Barry.

404
00:20:06,439 --> 00:20:08,139
Barry, can you hear me?

405
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:10,074
- His vitals are weak,
but he's alive, dr. Wells.

406
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,376
I'm sure he's fine.

407
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,279
I can't breathe.

408
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,349
- He needs oxygen.
Get the crash cart!

409
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:24,288
- Barry!

410
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,123
Barry.
- Cut me open.

411
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,426
The poison's still in me.
- He brought us a sample.

412
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,695
Caitlin, we need to do
a pulmonary biopsy,

413
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,230
Extract an active portion
of that gas.

414
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,731
- I can't give you
any anesthetic.

415
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,466
Your metabolism will burn
right through it.

416
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:37,435
- I heal quick, remember?

417
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:38,703
- Do it.

418
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:39,870
- Cisco, give me the syringe.

419
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,039
This is gonna hurt a lot.

420
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,141
- It's a small needle.
You probably won't even feel it.

421
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,477
- You're definitely
going to feel it.

422
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,023
- The streak lives.

423
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:00,358
- You'd be dead
if your lung cells

424
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,859
Didn't regenerate
so quickly.

425
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,761
- My chest feels like
that one time

426
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,364
I had a cigarette.

427
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,165
Yeah, teen me lived for danger.

428
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,533
- This isn't funny.
You could've--

429
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:11,669
- I didn't.

430
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:14,839
- Now that we have a sample,
we'll get to work analyzing it,

431
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,340
Figure out the makeup
of the poison,

432
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,476
Maybe get a clue as to
his human identity.

433
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,712
- Or at least a way to stop him
from turning into a mist.

434
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,649
The mist.
Okay, that's his name.

435
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:25,983
End of discussion.

436
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,351
- I have to get
to the station.

437
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:28,986
- You should be resting.

438
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:31,522
- I have to talk to joe.

439
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,027
Joe.
I had him.

440
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,662
The meta-human.
We were wrong.

441
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,531
He's not controlling
airborne toxins.

442
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,334
He can literally transform
himself into poison gas.

443
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:46,270
- That's new.

444
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,938
The victim was a judge.

445
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,540
We're going through
some of her old cases

446
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,808
To see if there's a connection.

447
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,110
- It's too late.

448
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:54,545
I should have been faster.

449
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:56,147
- Focus on the job.

450
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:58,816
Don't think about that
right now.

451
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,252
- You don't want to know
what I'm thinking about.

452
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:09,327
My dad has spent 14 years

453
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:14,198
In a 6x8-foot cell
for a crime he didn't commit.

454
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,500
I couldn't save my mom,
but I can save him.

455
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,102
- Didn't I promise you

456
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,771
That we would get your father
out of prison together?

457
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,208
- I don't need your help, joe.

458
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,776
I could be in and out of there
with him

459
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:29,447
Before anyone even sees me.

460
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,415
- Okay.

461
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:34,352
You break him out of there.

462
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,854
Then what?

463
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,857
He's on the run
for the rest of his life.

464
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,059
And something tell me
he's not as fast as you are.

465
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,527
- You don't know
what it's like there.

466
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,096
- You think I don't understand

467
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,997
What you're feeling?

468
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,266
I have been a cop
for almost as long

469
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:51,168
As you've been alive.

470
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,837
So you should know,
putting on that suit

471
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,939
Does not make everybody safe.

472
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,440
For every person you save,

473
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:58,109
There's gonna be somebody
you can't.

474
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:59,944
And the hardest thing
you're gonna have to face

475
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,979
Is not some monster out there
with powers.

476
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:04,448
It's gonna be that feeling
of uselessness

477
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,585
When you can't do anything.

478
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,461
Or the guilt that weighs on you
when you make a mistake.

479
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:27,905
Some things, barry,
you can't fight.

480
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:32,476
Some things
you just have to live with.

481
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,696
- Yes, I'm writing this down.

482
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,565
Red streak at the mall

483
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,734
During the gas attack.

484
00:23:56,736 --> 00:24:00,004
Thank you for calling.

485
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,705
Never fails.

486
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,808
Tip lines bring out
the potheads and the crazies.

487
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,876
- Did they get a good look
at the streak's face?

488
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,580
- Not you too.

489
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,783
What are you doing here anyway?

490
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:15,186
- We need to talk.

491
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,622
I thought about what you said,
and--

492
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,691
- I know what you're gonna say.

493
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:21,926
I understand.

494
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,360
I'm your dad's partner.

495
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,596
- No, no, no,
you don't understand.

496
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:29,467
I have never really had
a serious boyfriend.

497
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,902
Between dad and barry and work,

498
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,537
My life has been full.

499
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,874
And I really like you,

500
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,976
But I thought that if I told
my dad about us,

501
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,811
Then it would make this real,

502
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,614
And suddenly, it's something
that I could lose

503
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:47,418
Or screw up.

504
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,854
- I wanted it to be real.

505
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,155
- Eddie.

506
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:20,451
- I'm sorry.

507
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:22,186
I didn't mean to scare you,
leaving like that.

508
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,688
- It's okay.
I get it.

509
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,325
You had to go.

510
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:31,328
It's just--

511
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,831
That's the last thing that
ronnie said to me that night.

512
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,607
- My mother died
14 years ago.

513
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,779
I used to think that
the further away I got from it,

514
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:53,284
The less it would hurt.

515
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:56,754
But some days, the pain,

516
00:25:56,756 --> 00:26:01,091
It's worse than the day
that it happened.

517
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,993
Some things you can't fight.

518
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,366
- For so long,

519
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:13,537
I've been terrified
of going into that hole.

520
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,839
- What if I went with you?

521
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,591
- Where's ronnie?
Cisco, where is he?

522
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,759
- He's still inside.
- What? Open the door.

523
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,595
- I can't.
We're in lockdown mode.

524
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,597
- Cisco, we have to get him
out of there or he'll die.

525
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,166
- Cisco, can you hear me?
- Ronnie, it's me.

526
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,771
Caitlin.

527
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,076
Is cisco there?

528
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,011
- Yeah, ronnie, I'm here.
I'm listening.

529
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,280
- I adjusted the magnets
to redirect the beam

530
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,681
To try and vent the system

531
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,717
So the blast goes up
and not out.

532
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,685
- I'll need to reset
the particle parameters

533
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:03,721
To compensate.

534
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,090
- Cisco's doing it.

535
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:07,658
There has to be another way
out of there.

536
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,928
You have to find it.

537
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,897
- Cait, the chain reaction,

538
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:15,933
I can't reverse it.

539
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:21,171
The doors need to stay shut
to protect you.

540
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,439
You still there?

541
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,741
- I'm here.

542
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,749
- Caitlin, whatever happens--

543
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:32,750
- Ronnie.

544
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,253
Ronnie!

545
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,663
He saved so many lives
that day,

546
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:48,232
And no one will ever know
what he did.

547
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,640
- I do.

548
00:27:56,642 --> 00:28:00,244
He was a hero.

549
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:03,647
- I didn't want him
to be a hero.

550
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,649
I wanted him to be my husband.

551
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,557
- Barry, caitlin,
you down there?

552
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,459
You got to come look at this.

553
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,800
Hey, check this out.

554
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,802
It's a 3-d molecular model
of the gas

555
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,036
We retrieved from your lungs.

556
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,805
- We have identified the toxin.

557
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,540
- Hydrogen cyanide?

558
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:32,309
- What's interesting
is what's mixed in

559
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:36,046
With the cyanide--
a sedative.

560
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,881
- Of course.

561
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,517
The night of the explosion,
find out if anyone was executed.

562
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,052
- Why?

563
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,987
- That sedative is given
to criminals on death row

564
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:45,289
Before they go
to the gas chamber

565
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,557
And breathe in hydrogen cyanide.

566
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,825
- That's right.

567
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,226
- There was someone executed.

568
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,794
Kyle nimbus.
- That's him.

569
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:53,330
- He was a hit man
for the darbinyan crime family.

570
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,199
They turned on him
and testified.

571
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:58,068
Judge theresa howard
was the judge at his trial.

572
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,136
She sentenced him to death.

573
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,504
- He must have been affected

574
00:29:00,506 --> 00:29:02,639
By the explosion
while he was being gassed.

575
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:04,908
- Records indicate
the execution was completed.

576
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,477
- That's why
there wasn't a match.

577
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,312
The dna database only has
records of the living.

578
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:09,913
- Right.

579
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,715
- He said there was
one more person on his list.

580
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,650
Check the arrest record.
Who caught him?

581
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,285
That could be his next attack.

582
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:18,622
- Barry, the lead detective...

583
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,531
- Here to see henry allen.

584
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,866
- Sign here.

585
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,267
Personal effects here.

586
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,955
- Eddie.
- Barry, what's up?

587
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,357
- Hey, do you know
where joe went?

588
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,625
He's not picking up his cell.

589
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,560
- Uh, not sure.

590
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:58,362
- Eddie, it's really important
I speak to him.

591
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,898
I need to know
where he went.

592
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,701
- He went to iron heights
to see your dad.

593
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,471
- Barry.

594
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,807
I reverse-engineered
an antidote to the toxin.

595
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,575
I hope you won't need it.

596
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,064
- What are you doing here?
Is barry all right?

597
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,599
- He's fine.

598
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,505
- Then to what
do I owe this visit?

599
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:44,208
- I know I should have
come to see you sooner.

600
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,543
- You just weren't up
for a little chitchat

601
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,847
With a man who murdered his wife
in front of his own son?

602
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:53,150
- Except now I know
you didn't kill your wife.

603
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:02,025
- Barry, I pulled up the specs
on iron heights prison.

604
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,694
It's maximum security,

605
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:06,797
But I think I can talk you
through breaking in there.

606
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:07,798
- Don't bother.

607
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,799
I've been figuring out

608
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:09,867
How to break into that place

609
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,702
Since I was 11.

610
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:14,705
- Some new evidence
has come to light.

611
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,907
I can't go into detail.

612
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,976
It's just--

613
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:22,312
Look, the important thing is,

614
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,748
I'm reopening the case.

615
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,918
I'm gonna find out
who really killed nora,

616
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,253
And I promise you, henry,

617
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,054
I'm going to get you
out of here.

618
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,393
I am so sorry.

619
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:39,196
- It doesn't matter
that you didn't believe in me...

620
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,368
Because you always believed
in my son.

621
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,460
- Nimbus.

622
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,696
You're supposed to be dead.
- Same to you.

623
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,836
- Joe?

624
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,772
Joe!

625
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:22,773
Help!

626
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,341
Guards!

627
00:32:24,343 --> 00:32:25,609
Somebody help!

628
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,601
Go get him.

629
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,518
So you've come to finish
what the gas chamber couldn't?

630
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,922
- You're going somewhere you
can't hurt anyone ever again.

631
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:15,225
- Wrong.

632
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,003
- He used the antidote on joe.

633
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,071
You need to stay away from him,
barry.

634
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:29,606
Do not breathe him in.

635
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,881
- I'm not sure
how that helps me, guys.

636
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,927
- You can't fight him, barry.

637
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,663
Just keep him coming at you.

638
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,065
That should sap his strength.

639
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,167
- Gas is the least stable form
of matter.

640
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,402
This meta-human will not be able

641
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,770
To stay in his mist form
for long.

642
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:01,638
His particles will need
to reform.

643
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,900
- Barry.

644
00:35:03,902 --> 00:35:07,671
Barry.

645
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,239
- We win.

646
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:26,189
- It's been a while
since I watched you sleep.

647
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,864
Rescuing you is exhausting.

648
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:36,032
- I really miss the ability

649
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,068
To be able to ground you.

650
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,770
- Sorry I went and grew up.

651
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,478
I could have got my dad
out of iron heights tonight.

652
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,481
- I know.

653
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,749
- But you were right.

654
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,784
That's not the way.

655
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,052
- Daddy.
- Oh.

656
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,688
Baby, I'm fine.
Don't worry.

657
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:06,096
- I'll let you guys talk.

658
00:36:06,098 --> 00:36:09,866
- Partner.

659
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:12,569
You two arrive at the same time?

660
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,575
- Dad, we have something
that we need to tell you.

661
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,879
Dad, the thing is--

662
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,882
- You two are dating.

663
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:27,384
I know.
- You do?

664
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:30,487
- I'm a detective, remember?

665
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:34,424
And both of you
are lousy liars.

666
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,659
- So you're not mad?

667
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,694
- Oh, I'm mad.

668
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,629
And if the doctor
hadn't confiscated my gun,

669
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,932
We'd be having an entirely
different conversation.

670
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,602
- Well, I should let
you two talk,

671
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,438
And I'll just be outside

672
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,840
Looking into
the witness protection program.

673
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:55,212
- I'm sorry.

674
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:58,114
- Iris,
this is going to be complicated.

675
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,383
You know
I don't like complicated.

676
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,022
Do you like him?

677
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,225
- Yeah, I do.

678
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,427
- Then I will do my damnedest
not to shoot him.

679
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:12,562
- That is all I ask.

680
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,371
- Will it hold?

681
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,839
- The barrier is powered by

682
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:25,675
An 8.3 tesla superconducting
electromagnet,

683
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,278
Which is about 100,000 times
the strength

684
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,914
Of earth's magnetic field.

685
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,617
- In other words, yes.

686
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:38,054
- Hmm.
He's mad.

687
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:41,791
- Well, good night.

688
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:48,898
- So we're just supposed
to get used to

689
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,201
Working above a makeshift prison

690
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:54,604
Housing evil people
with superpowers.

691
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,107
- You'd be surprised what
you can get used to, caitlin.

692
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,081
- Caitlin.

693
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,816
Could I talk to you
for a second?

694
00:38:06,818 --> 00:38:09,919
- Sure.
What's up?

695
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:12,088
- It's about the night
that ronnie died.

696
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,126
I--

697
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:20,430
- Look, cisco, I'm okay.

698
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:23,433
I thought coming down here
would undo me,

699
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:28,004
But thinking about
what ronnie did to protect us...

700
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,741
It just made me love him more.

701
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,281
Come on.

702
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,283
I need ice cream or a drink.

703
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:42,152
Let's see which one
we hit first.

704
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:52,896
- Joe's gonna be okay.

705
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,705
You know, lately I've been
thinking about mom.

706
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:04,074
A lot.

707
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:08,378
I miss her.

708
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:11,648
- Did I ever tell you about
the time you learned to walk?

709
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,852
A couple times.

710
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,554
- Everyone was walking
before you.

711
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:19,723
All the little babies
running around the neighborhood,

712
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:21,358
Not you.

713
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,625
But your mom was never worried.

714
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,894
She just said,
"he'll walk

715
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:29,466
When he has someplace to go."

716
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:32,502
And sure enough, the first time
you took a few steps,

717
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:37,407
You moved so quick,
you didn't just walk,

718
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,408
You started...

719
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:42,045
- To run.

720
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:45,749
- And you ran to your mom,
barry.

721
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:49,219
Right into her arms.

722
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,392
You had someplace to go.

723
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,903
- I thought being
the fastest man alive

724
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,972
Would make my life easier--

725
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:11,141
That I could outrun anything.

726
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,980
Turns out,
no one can outrun pain.

727
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:18,648
- Somebody help!
Please, somebody!

728
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,183
- Life is tragic.

729
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:28,057
But it's also precious...

730
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,428
And sweet...

731
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:38,134
And extraordinary.

732
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:47,510
And the only way I know
to honor my mom's life

733
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,579
Is to keep running.

734
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,367
- Dr. Wells.

735
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:12,936
Dr. Wells, ronnie did it.

736
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,304
He vented the system.

737
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,772
S.T.A.R. Labs should hold.

738
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,907
- Good man.

739
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:19,542
I'm on my way down.

740
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:59,649
- See you soon, barry.

741
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,940
- Greg, move your head.
