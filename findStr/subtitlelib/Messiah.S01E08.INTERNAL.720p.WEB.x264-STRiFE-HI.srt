1
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,560
[al-Masih] Mr. President.

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,066
[door closes]

3
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,608
[outer door closes]

4
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,908
This will be a confidential conversation.

5
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:35,702
I'm sure you understand.

6
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,706
You think it would reflect badly on you
to meet with me.

7
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,750
But still, you're meeting with me.

8
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,626
You don't seem at all surprised.

9
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,464
- By any of this.
- You are why I came to Washington.

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,718
So you knew we were gonna come
take you in the night?

11
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,929
We would always find this moment,
one way or the other.

12
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:57,640
This is our destiny.

13
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,767
Is it?

14
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,436
Why?

15
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,399
We are sitting here, aren't we?

16
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,527
What is it you want?

17
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,448
Your consideration.

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,576
Well, I'm sitting here, aren't I?

19
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,872
You were once a warrior.

20
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,876
You have seen the pain of war.

21
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,003
Up close.

22
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,840
And you know the cycle of history.

23
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,968
Blood brings blood, on and on...

24
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,971
for generations, until it is an ocean.

25
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,683
So you've come
with a prepared speech, have you?

26
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,478
Is that... how this will go?

27
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,733
Tell me why you've come here.

28
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,905
How far would you go to bring about
a thousand years of peace?

29
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,912
I would do anything, but it is impossible.

30
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,914
Not only possible but simple.

31
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,959
Withdraw all American troops.

32
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,586
- From where?
- Everywhere.

33
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,089
Are you serious?

34
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,674
Bring them all home.

35
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,136
Every man, every woman, every person.

36
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,224
If you do this, you'll be remembered
as the president of peace.

37
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,309
This is...

38
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,437
very naive.

39
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,191
Our troops abroad...

40
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,986
for the most part,
are a peacekeeping measure.

41
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,946
To withdraw them would be disastrous.

42
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:38,449
It would only encourage rogue states
and marauding groups to strike.

43
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,954
Where I am from, a hundred years ago...

44
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,291
Europeans drew lines on paper

45
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,376
and called them borders.

46
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,754
America has enforced those lines

47
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,757
and given strength to brutal dictators.

48
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,719
- You know that to be true.
- You can't hold Americans accountable

49
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,971
- for the actions of other leaders.
- M Lai.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,931
No Gun Ri.

51
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,600
Azizabad.

52
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,309
Haditha.

53
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,146
Abu Ghraib.

54
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,109
Your forces haven't always kept the peace.

55
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,196
Those are all deeply regrettable
and isolated incidents.

56
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:20,325
Our presence on the world stage
has always been a stabilizing influence.

57
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,660
And always will be, you can't deny that.

58
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,037
Just one example:

59
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,166
Russia has been massing forces
on their border with Latvia and Estonia.

60
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,211
If we were to evacuate our forces nearby,

61
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,214
Russia would be emboldened
and might invade Eastern Europe.

62
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,550
- You don't know that would happen.
- I've got a pretty good idea.

63
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,303
- History tells me.
- There is no more history.

64
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,596
History has ended.

65
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,681
There is only now.

66
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,393
I don't think you understand...

67
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,103
what you're asking.

68
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,273
I understand perfectly well.

69
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,068
Well, then, if that's true,
I question your motives.

70
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,527
I only have one master.

71
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,780
We know a lot more about you
than you think we do.

72
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,699
Whatever you know,
it doesn't change a thing.

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,410
The world is about to begin again

74
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,454
and you need to do your part.

75
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,252
I can't see how
what you're asking would help.

76
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,047
You cannot see what is to come,
you have to act on faith.

77
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,675
If you don't...

78
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,636
a heavy price will be paid.

79
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,098
Is that supposed to be
some sort of threat?

80
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,642
A warning.

81
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,229
Ah, this is nonsense.

82
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,567
Let me ask you this.

83
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,947
Do you call yourself a Latter-day Saint?

84
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,449
[sighs]

85
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,743
I do.

86
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,706
Do you believe in God?

87
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,084
Yes, I do.

88
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,588
So these are the latter days?

89
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,175
They are.

90
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,513
Do you believe God would go silent?

91
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,726
That he would abandon you?

92
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,982
Or do you believe
he still speaks to humanity?

93
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,904
I believe he still speaks.

94
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,702
He's speaking to you now.

95
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,390
[squelching]

96
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,237
[seabirds calling]

97
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,800
[Bailey] <i>So, Golshiri is
a trained magician?</i>

98
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,427
The brother also claimed
that he was involuntarily committed

99
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,221
at the Tehran Psychiatric Hospital.

100
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,305
What for?

101
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,557
I have an agent looking into it.

102
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,185
That's just the kind of stuff
Collier's looking for.

103
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,313
Let's just keep it in house
for now, though.

104
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,357
<i>- Thank you.
- </i>Where are you now?

105
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,151
Digging a little deeper.

106
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,865
[man] I don't see the connection.

107
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,159
He was only a student here
for one semester.

108
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:56,457
I don't see anything with Wallace.
No, uh... courses. No... social clubs.

109
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,460
No study groups.

110
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,712
Nothing.

111
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,422
You're sure?

112
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,717
It's a wholly unremarkable record.

113
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:13,307
Two intro survey courses,
one seminar on international relations.

114
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,185
Reasonable grades.

115
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,397
There's no other documentation
on Golshiri?

116
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,694
Well, he was in an advanced seminar,

117
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,654
which requires a final term paper.

118
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,448
40 pages minimum. We...

119
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,574
We, uh...

120
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,744
have them bound
to keep them all in the library.

121
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,706
So you'd have a copy of Golshiri's paper.

122
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,667
Presumably.

123
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,043
I'd like to see that.

124
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,838
Now, please.

125
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:50,052
"Transformational Politics - A New Era,"
Payam Golshiri.

126
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,890
Golshiri, let's see.

127
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,809
Golshiri.

128
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,270
It should be...

129
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,397
right...

130
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,649
It...

131
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,487
Huh.

132
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,865
...seems to be missing.

133
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,411
It probably got moved somewhere.

134
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,871
Don't worry, we'll find it.

135
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,128
No, I don't think we're supposed to.

136
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,967
[phone rings]

137
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,386
- Hey.
- [man] <i>Hey.</i>

138
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,223
Just saw your text.

139
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,309
<i>Yeah, sorry. I...</i>

140
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,061
<i>I know it was late.</i>

141
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,396
<i>It's fine.</i>

142
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,147
What's up?

143
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,361
I just think I'm lyin' to myself.

144
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,657
What do you mean?

145
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,368
[sighs] <i>I just...</i>

146
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,913
When I stopped pretendin'
about who I was, I...

147
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,791
I just thought everythin'
would become a lot...

148
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,918
easier.

149
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,088
<i>A lot of things are easier.</i>

150
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,174
We're just tryin' to make our way.

151
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,342
You and me.

152
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,513
It's not the answer to everythin'.

153
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,764
[man sighs]

154
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,891
[laughs] <i>Never said it would be.</i>

155
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,770
Bigger things than us.

156
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,021
<i>Huh.</i>

157
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,275
Well, I forgot that.

158
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,027
<i>You sure you're okay?</i>

159
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,614
Yeah, I just needed to talk.

160
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,828
I... I should go.

161
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,289
Well, good talk.

162
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,916
I love you.

163
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,836
<i>I love you too.</i>

164
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,879
Bye.

165
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,765
[in Arabic] Did he really walk on water?

166
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,935
It happened far away.
It's difficult to know.

167
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,649
We are here now, aren't we?

168
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,153
And there are problems
right in front of us.

169
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:18,200
The other refugees, the ones you led...
and the rest of Palestine...

170
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,290
I would ask you
to read this statement in public.

171
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,251
You are a hero, Jibril...

172
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,178
and your voice can be powerful
and influential.

173
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,391
You want me to say all this?

174
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,645
I urge you to look it over.

175
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,361
We believe that we have
the right of sovereignty...

176
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,322
and the right to be free of occupation.

177
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:02,912
This is something you must understand...

178
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,499
after living in Yarmouk your whole life.

179
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,503
We need to be recognized, as a nation.

180
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:21,429
Hm?

181
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,807
What's wrong?

182
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,727
Do you not agree?

183
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,856
I don't know how to read.

184
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,250
[sighs]

185
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,894
There's only one book.

186
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,368
It's time to put away childish things.

187
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,712
[door closes]

188
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,596
Listen, I know there was Secret Service
in the hotel last night.

189
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,324
So, either you give me a statement
that helps shape the narrative...

190
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,558
- [commotion]
- [man] al-Masih!

191
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,977
- Guys, guys...
- al-Masih!

192
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,148
- [man 2] al-Masih.
- [man] We have questions for you.

193
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,317
- [woman] al-Masih!
- Come on.

194
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,760
- I hear you have some questions.
- [all yelling]

195
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,970
- [woman 2] Why Washington?
- [man] Who do you represent?

196
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,287
Did you really walk on water?

197
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,748
Don't you trust your eyes?

198
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,291
What did you see?

199
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,503
A lot of people are calling you a hoax.
Do you have a response?

200
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,007
I am real, if that's what you're asking.

201
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,721
You can touch me if you need proof.

202
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,481
- I can confirm he exists.
- [laughter]

203
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,483
Are you a Democrat or Republican?

204
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,443
I am not running for office.

205
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,153
Why do people call you "al-Masih"?

206
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,166
Because it's what they've chosen
to call me.

207
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,680
- [man] Why have you chosen...
- [Miriam] Are you the Messiah?

208
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,248
I am a message.

209
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,458
No, answer the question.

210
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,378
Are you the Messiah?

211
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,216
I am here to bring about
the world to come.

212
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,459
- [man] How do you like DC?
- [woman] But that's vague.

213
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,824
[vase smashes]

214
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,452
You said you stand at the gate
of a new nation.

215
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,955
Was that a metaphor or a call to arms?

216
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,331
It's not a metaphor.

217
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,502
Is that why you brought
all these people here, for revolution?

218
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,378
I...

219
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,591
I didn't bring them. They followed.

220
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,634
That's semantics. They're here now.

221
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,971
Why come to DC?
What are you going to do here?

222
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,183
Last night I met with President Young.

223
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,935
- [exclamations]
- [woman] Wow...

224
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,646
We discussed how to achieve world peace.

225
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,958
- [woman] Where did you meet?
- [Miriam] What did you say?

226
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,318
- [man] Alone?
- [woman] Why wasn't the press invited?

227
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,072
It was a constructive conversation.

228
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,159
You'll have to ask the president
to elaborate on specifics.

229
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,118
[Miriam] No, why was...

230
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,203
<i>Why was this meeting held in secret?</i>

231
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,748
[Collier] Tell me this isn't true.

232
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,668
- I'd hoped he didn't go public.
- Why didn't you consult me?

233
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,129
'Cause I knew what you'd say.

234
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,381
We have to put out a statement.

235
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,176
Damage control.
Distance you from this crackpot.

236
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,012
We don't know what he wants.
We don't know who sent him.

237
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>- </i>Think of the optics.
- I don't care about the optics.

238
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,768
Ball's in our court now.

239
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,730
I need to take some time
and think about how to respond.

240
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,651
Maybe we can make some good out of this.

241
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,444
Are you kidding? "Good"?

242
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,364
What, did he offer you
some golden plates he dug up?

243
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,532
You need to pull yourself together.

244
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,202
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

245
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,996
You know that I respect your faith.

246
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,498
I accept your apology.

247
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,377
- Let me put out a...
- I need more time.

248
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,231
- You're dismissed.
- [woman] <i>The White House</i>

249
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,966
<i>is clearly caught flat-footed here,</i>

250
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,135
<i>the press secretary declining
to comment this morning so far.</i>

251
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,889
<i>This is far from normal protocol
for any president. To actually...</i>

252
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,475
How the hell did this happen?

253
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,436
<i>- </i>Who are you?
- Agent Rhymer.

254
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,855
- Where's Mathers?
- He left.

255
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,484
- So you've been on Golshiri, then?
- Yeah.

256
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,237
So tell me, how is it possible
that he met with the president?

257
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,573
He moved around a lot last night.
Left the hotel.

258
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,368
We were on him until Secret Service
took him for a couple of hours.

259
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,453
- Why wasn't I notified?
- It was need-to-know.

260
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,580
Well, now the whole goddamn world knows.

261
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,003
- [door slams]
- [clears throat]

262
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,380
[Felix] <i>You didn't tell me
you saw the president!</i>

263
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,589
I know.

264
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,799
You know, I... I...

265
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,344
I could have at least
set up the press conference for you.

266
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,698
We could have had more reporters there,
a bigger audience.

267
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,724
God's message is reaching the world.

268
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,517
[Felix sighs]

269
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,604
You asked me to guide us from Texas,

270
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,356
and we ended up in Washington.

271
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,200
That feels like it was
the right move, right?

272
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,403
- It was.
- So you trusted me with that, but now...

273
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,530
what, I'm out of the loop?

274
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,450
I didn't need you for this.

275
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:15,992
Why not?

276
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,121
What are you asking me?

277
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,790
- What is my part in all this?
- Only you know that.

278
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,375
- And how do I know that?
- Pray.

279
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,378
Pray? To who?
Aren't you supposed to be God?

280
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,214
Do you believe that?

281
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,135
Then kneel down, Felix.

282
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,709
Wh... what are you doing?

283
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,629
Goin' back to Texas.

284
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,256
Why? Did they ask you to go back?

285
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,175
No. It was my choice.

286
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,970
- Just... done all I can do here.
- No. I need you to stay here.

287
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,224
You've been watching Golshiri,
you know what we're dealing with.

288
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,017
Yes, I do.

289
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,520
And I believe him.

290
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,702
[door closes]

291
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,996
[sighs]

292
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,252
- [Eva] What did Mathers find?
- Nothing.

293
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,335
Nothing?

294
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,838
What was he working on?

295
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
What's this?

296
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,137
Call logs to and from phone booths
from Texas to DC.

297
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,639
- You asked for those.
- Can I get them in digital?

298
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,808
That's what they gave me.

299
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,980
You're a guest in this investigation.

300
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,399
That invitation can be revoked.

301
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,411
Is it true?

302
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,664
Yeah, it's true.
Why do you think I'm calling you?

303
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,708
<i>This is a diplomatic nightmare.</i>

304
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,543
I advised the president against it,

305
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,628
<i>but he's his own man, as you well know.</i>

306
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,380
You could have given me a warning.

307
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,798
<i>Well, it's happened already.</i>

308
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,759
It's time the two of us
dealt with this ourselves.

309
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,261
<i>What does that mean?</i>

310
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,471
You do want this problem to go away,
don't you, Danny?

311
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,097
You know I do.

312
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,935
Then I need you to set up
a back channel to Israel.

313
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,400
[footsteps approaching]

314
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,746
You smoke?

315
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,042
It's very expensive here.

316
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,294
No, thank you.

317
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,221
You didn't tell me you had a brother.

318
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,723
Adar?

319
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,520
Hm?

320
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,025
What, you like making speeches
when everybody's watching

321
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,485
and now you have nothing to say?

322
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,073
There is no crime in having a brother.

323
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,326
So you don't deny having a brother...

324
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,161
parents?

325
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,788
No. [chuckles]

326
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,289
What, so...

327
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,543
so you're not who you pretend to be?

328
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,921
I do not pretend to be anyone.

329
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,301
[thunder rumbles]

330
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,385
Okay.

331
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,100
Are you Payam Golshiri?

332
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,146
I have been known by that name.

333
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,690
[scoffs]

334
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,401
"I have been known by that name."

335
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,487
It's your fucking name.

336
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,616
Oh, my God, you're so full of shit.

337
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,327
No?

338
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,662
Go ahead, walk across it.

339
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,666
Show me a miracle. Prove yourself to me.

340
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,710
If you want, you can open it in two.

341
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,795
[thunder rumbles]

342
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,297
No?

343
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,258
Wow.

344
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,352
[in Hebrew] Wonder of Wonders.

345
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,899
Why do you think
you're still here, Aviram?

346
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,693
In America?

347
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,656
I'm sightseeing.

348
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,743
Let me know when you have seen enough.

349
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,955
And you should call your daughter.

350
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,260
[President] I thought
we had an understanding

351
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,471
that our meeting was
to be just between us.

352
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,599
That didn't suit my purposes.

353
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,810
Why did you want to see me again?

354
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,273
Has the angel not visited you?

355
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,193

I... I... don't understand.

358
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,788
Have you made up your mind, John?

359
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,625
I just need a little more time to think,

360
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,460
I need time...
There is no time.

Dad, there's somethin' I need to tell you.

385
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,910
- It's important.
- What?

386
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,413
Remember that trip
Mom and I took to Austin last year?

387
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,040
Rebecca. Don't.

388
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,792
I went to Austin to get an abortion.

389
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,712
What?

390
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,798
What are you saying?

391
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,258
I got pregnant.

392
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,429
I was scared, and I told Mom,
and she took me to a clinic.

393
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,722
Is this true?

394
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,433
- Is it?
- Yes.

395
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:19,976
You knew?

396
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,103
And you lied.

397
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,273
- You kept this from me.
- I thought it would be better.

398
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,817
- Who's the father?
- It doesn't matter, Dad.

399
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,571
How could you?

400
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,408
I don't need to be ashamed of it anymore.

401
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,410
Why are you telling me now?

402
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,579
- [Anna] Felix.
- No, you don't get to "Felix" me.

403
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,623
Now you tell me?

404
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,460
How am I supposed to stand next to him

It's okay, Dad.

None of this is on you.

What's that supposed to mean?

411
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,239
He didn't come for you.

412
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,701
He came for me.

Dad, where are you? I've been calling.
I need you to call me back.

418
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,430
I see Edgewater's on the evacuation list.

God, I hope... I hope you're out of there.

Yes.

426
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,377
Why?

427
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,796
Why do it?

428
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,340
Why would you let him go?

429
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,801
Because he is the Messiah.

Away. Working.

Work?

437
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,253
That's not what I heard.

<i>It doesn't matter what you heard.</i>

439
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,925
So you didn't get yourself suspended?

440
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,597
I didn't call to fight with you.
I just want to talk to my daughter.

Why not?

Are you married?

474
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,451
I don't know anymore.

475
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,330
You should probably figure that out.

476

- What about you?
- This can't happen.

477
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,797
Why not?

It just can't.

00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,269
So... what did you want?

485
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,314
Take it.

486
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,524
I don't want it.

487
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,278
It's all there.

488
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,117
Good.

'Cause you didn't do your fuckin' job.

I don't want you to call me ever again.

00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:31,801
Are you really so stupid
as to believe him?

492
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,431
Can't you of all people tell
when someone's faking it?

493
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,393
Doesn't matter if he's real.

494
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,020
He's good.

495
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,111

[Young] <i>My heart breaks for those

Beyond the physical damage

to businesses, to homes...

500
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,678
the human cost is staggering.

501
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,226
In order to free up funds, I've declared
a federal state of emergency.

502
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,437
We're doing everything we can.
I ask that we all pray,

503
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,730
and ask God...

504
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,274
for...

505
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,110

for, uh...

507
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:20,284
I ask that you all join me in praying
for those in danger.

508
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,956
May God guide us and protect us
during these difficult times.

[door opens]

511
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,513
You wanted to speak with me?

512
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,852
I want to know who you really are.

513
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,105
You don't know who I am?

514
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:50,982
Actually, I don't.

515
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,986
And that's really starting
to feel like a problem.

516
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,911
What are you afraid of?

517
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:11,002
Why did you choose my family?

518

Why are we here with you?

519
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,591
Your faith.

520
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,217
Our faith?

521
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,262
Maybe we have you fooled too.

522
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,975
Faith can be found
in the most unlikely places.

523
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,855
Is that what you see in my daughter?

524
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,191
Faith?

Rebecca...

- That's not good enough.

She's just a child, you know.

You are a mother lion, Anna.

530

You want to protect her
and keep her close, I understand.

531
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,507
But she will be her own person
one day soon,

532
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,219
and you will need to let her go.

533
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,056
What do you want with her?

534
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:11,187
Are you worried about your daughter?
Or are you worried about yourself?

535
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,773
I'm worried about you.

536
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,316
About what you want.

537
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,571
I only want what God wants.

538
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,499
And what is it that God wants?

539
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,460
[crowd chanting] al-Masih! al-Masih!

540
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,421
He wants the flood.
