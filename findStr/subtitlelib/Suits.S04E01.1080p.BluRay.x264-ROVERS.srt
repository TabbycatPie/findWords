1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,126
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,242
I have a Iist here
of the signing bonuses

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,051
of the top three associates
who have come into this firm.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,130
An advance, plus my salary,
will cover my tuition.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,486
Those numbers don't add up.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,446
Summer associates work as Iawyers,
and I can do the same.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,291
It's an offer Ietter.
We're investment bankers.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,209
Ourjob blows yours out of the water.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,731
Harvey, Stephanie Liston just called me.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,842
She said they just brought Mike in
for questioning.

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,885
You're a dirty Iawyer,
and now you're on my radar.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,731
I'm tired of putting the people
I care about in jeopardy.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,803
I called Jonathan Sidwell
this afternoon.

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,526
I took the job.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,529
Mike Ross never went
to Iaw school.

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,168
I knew it, and I hired him anyway.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,243
- I still can't stay, Harvey.
- I'm sorry.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,490
Give me permission to go.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,800
- You going to work or school?
- Both.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,971
You think have time
for some of this? (LAUGHS)

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,962
Maybe if you loan me your limo.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,971
Hmm.

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,248
- I'm sure <i>we</i> can work something out.
- Mmm-hmm.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,681
(CHUCKLING)

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,968
- I thought you were getting dressed.
- I did get dressed.

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,721
- And then you got undressed.
- I got a little hot.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,968
Yes. You did.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,168
Come to think of it, it is
getting a little warm in here.

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,004
Mr. Gillie.
Mike Ross. Nice to meet you.

30
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,761
You should know I'm only doing this
as a courtesy to Jonathan Sidwell,

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
but I'll tell you right now,
the answer is no.

32
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,488
- Good.
- Why good?

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,570
Because a yes is always
so much better when it starts as a no.

34
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,881
You're a confident young man,

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,480
but I know what my
distribution centers are worth.

36
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,883
- You know what they're worth to you.
- This is what they're worth to me.

37
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,644
This is bigger than I expected.

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,603
- I've heard that before.
- Okay, fun time's over.

39
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,801
I'm not interested in selling

40
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,922
to someone who I don't know
where they're coming from.

41
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,008
Let me tell you
where I'm coming from.

42
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,605
I do my homework.

43
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,526
These centers are a beacon
to every predator out there

44
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,246
that you haven't laid the groundwork
to get out of the DVD business.

45
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,966
Sounds to me like where you're coming
from is trying to scare me.

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,209
No. No, I'm not trying to scare you.
I'm trying to help you.

47
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,525
They're circling and you know it.

48
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,483
You don't do this,
you might as well

49
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,371
send out an invitation
asking for a hostile takeover.

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,246
- This number can't be real.
- It is.

51
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,522
Then, what the hell are you going to do
with my distribution centers?

52
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,008
I'll be happy to tell you that
five seconds after I buy them.

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,643
Walter, I know you want
your people to be okay,

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,604
and I give you my word they will be.
But these centers...

55
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,761
Have become a headache.

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,645
And you need cash for when
those predators come knocking.

57
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,366
Let them knock.
I'm not answering the door.

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,130
No, you're not hearing me.

59
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,290
If you don't raise enough money,

60
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,324
they're coming in whether
you answer that door or not.

61
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,410
That offer's good for another hour.

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,888
You are not my hair-gelled
partner in crime.

63
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,284
I haven't used hair gel
since ninth grade.

64
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,770
I was trying to avoid the frizzy look.

65
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,086
Where is he?

66
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,601
Uh, Donna said that he had a morning
meeting outside of the office.

67
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,201
- And where's Donna?
- Right here.

68
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,243
I prefer to appear
at the exact moment I'm needed.

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,771
I wish I could say
the same for Harvey.

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,484
- Oh. Well, Harvey has a very...
- Save it.

71
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,931
She may have been born yesterday,

72
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,970
but I know that morning meeting
doesn't mean morning meeting.

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,686
Everyone knows that.
It's just not my place to say it.

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,565
Not mine, either.
He did it yesterday, too.

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,611
When he resurfaces,
tell Specter Pearson wants to see him.

76
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,409
I used mousse in high school.
It was the '90s.

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,528
- Was it?
- I heard that.

78
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,329
- Did you bring me lunch?
- Chen Dynasty.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,843
- How many egg rolls are in here?
- Two.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,287
- You closed Gillie.
- Oh, I killed Gillie.

81
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,210
Well, I hope you told them
no mushrooms in the lo mein.

82
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,561
- You never told me that.
- I didn't think I had to.

83
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,444
Aren't you supposed to be
the one taking care of me?

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,164
Ugh. How am I supposed to do that

85
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,328
when there are mushrooms
in my lo mein?

86
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,090
Why do I keep you around again?

87
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,886
Deal memo on Friedman Technologies,
engagement letter signed by Stillman,

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,641
and oh, two front row tickets to Daft
Punk for you and Rachel tonight.

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,809
But why do I keep you around?

90
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,043
Mike, Sidwell's in there waiting for you.

91
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,640
Be careful, okay?
He's not in a good mood.

92
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,162
It's okay. You know why?
Because I killed it with Gillie.

93
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,691
- Hey, Amy.
- Yeah?

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,847
Eat the mushrooms.
They're good for you.

95
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,246
Screw you.

96
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,407
- Morning.
- Where have you been?

97
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,967
Oh, you know, just getting Walter Gillie
to sell us all of his distribution centers.

98
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,161
Oh.

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,048
- What the hell are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

100
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,241
I'm sending a message.

101
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,761
We're not a convent.
We're in business to make money.

102
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,961
And this deal does that.

103
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,242
You did this deal to retain
those people's jobs.

104
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,966
- And to make us 30 percent.
- We're a hedge fund.

105
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,161
If we don't make 50 percent,

106
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,362
we might as well buy time
shares and hope for the best.

107
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,204
That's bullshit.
This deal is solid.

108
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,886
No, what's bullshit is you've
been here for three months.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,128
All you've done is hit singles
and I need a goddamn home run.

110
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,805
- Jonathan.
- I don't want to hear it.

111
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,249
I want you to get your head
out of your ass.

112
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,570
Stop trying to save people's jobs,
and start making us some real money.

113
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,564
Or go back to being a lawyer.

114
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,808
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,083
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

116
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,409
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,803
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

118
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,930
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

119
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,368
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,161
All right

121
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,848
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

122
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,003
The greenback boogie

123
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,608
- I heard you wanted to see me?
- That was three hours ago.

124
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,245
If you knew what I was
doing three hours ago,

125
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,691
I don't think you would
have wanted to see me.

126
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,729
I know what you were
doing three hours ago.

127
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,002
Well, then, you should
have come on over.

128
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,969
Maybe you should try having
some morning meetings yourself.

129
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,242
Don't you worry
about my mornings.

130
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,840
What you need to worry
about is Logan Sanders.

131
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,966
What? He drive one of his father's
subsidiaries into bankruptcy?

132
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,367
The opposite.
Boy got his shit together.

133
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,960
Max is retiring,
and Logan's taking over.

134
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,651
- Let me guess, he wants a meeting.
- He's got one.

135
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,604
- With you. Tomorrow morning, 10 a.m.
- Great.

136
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,122
Push it a week.

137
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,402
Harvey, this kid considers
himself a young lion.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,521
He's going to want to make his mark.

139
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,644
And the easiest way for him to do that
is to change lawyers.

140
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,728
Maybe. But the last thing a lion wants

141
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,451
is to have his dinner handed
to him on a silver platter.

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,329
You're gonna give him a hunt.
Did you think of that all on your own?

143
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,602
I'm extra sharp. I haven't
worked a minute all morning.

144
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,722
See, that's funny because
I was late from all the sex.

145
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,285
Get the hell out of my office.

146
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,767
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
Bow-chicka-bow-bow.

147
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,645
Look what the cat dragged in.

148
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,328
- And you're wearing a vest.
- Here it comes.

149
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,162
Here what comes? Maze! tov.
Congratulations on your special day.

150
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,850
- That's a good one.
- DONNA: Harvey, leave him alone.

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,843
- He looks better than you do.
- Thank you, Donna.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,842
You're welcome.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,729
Oh, and Mr. Peanut called,

154
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,530
and he said he'd be happy
to lend you his top hat.

155
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,482
Are you two finished?

156
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,200
I could go all day.

157
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,607
- I think the vest had enough.
- Yeah.

158
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,967
So, you come all the way down
here just to let me know

159
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,684
that you were right about Walter Gillie?

160
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,929
I came all the way over here to tell you
lam done playing in the kiddie pool.

161
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,883
- I'm listening.
- I'm going after a whale.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,561
- I think I'm in love. Let's go to war.
- That's the thing.

163
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,485
We're not going to war.

164
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,088
Mike, the second whoever it is

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,441
finds out that you've got five
percent of their company,

166
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,846
we're going to war
whether you like it or not.

167
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,645
They're not going to find that
out because I don't own five percent.

168
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,001
Do I need to give you
a tutorial on the procedure?

169
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,050
- You start by buying shares.
- I know what the procedure is, Harvey.

170
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,003
- How many shares have you bought?
- None.

171
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,327
This phrase,
"I know what the procedure is"?

172
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,885
I don't think it means
what you think it means.

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,288
Well, as inconceivable
as it might be to you, Harvey,

174
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,051
- I'm actually not going in hostile.
- What are you talking about?

175
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,844
I'm talking about approaching someone

176
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,724
to buy their company
in order to keep it alive

177
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,887
instead of selling it for parts.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,207
You're offering someone
hugs and rainbows.

179
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,527
I'm offering someone
the chance to survive

180
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,326
and banking that they'll take that chance
rather than give up.

181
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,045
You don't have the money, do you?

182
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,004
No. I don't. But even if I did,
I wouldn't use it.

183
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,089
Oh, welcome to what every person
who doesn't have money has ever said.

184
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,965
Oh, I get it.

185
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,282
You think this is the meeting
where you make fun of my idea.

186
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,367
No, no, no, no, no:

187
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,006
This is the meeting where you realize
that my idea is happening

188
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,406
whether you like it or not.

189
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,886
- Where's the fun in that meeting?
- Oh, the fun?

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,890
It's all right over here
on this side of the table.

191
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,086
Hey, I'll give you a chance
to get acquainted with the new reality.

192
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,130
I'll be in my office.
Get back to me by the end of the day.

193
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,326
Wow. Looks like
our baby boy's all growns up.

194
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,928
Hey, tell me, sweetheart,
you guys validate parking?

195
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,326
Oh, yeah. Sure thing.

196
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,721
I've got it right here.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,411
And how many hours
is that good for?

198
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,841
What's it matter? We're just going
to charge it back to you anyway.

199
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,203
You know my secretary is, like, so much
younger and fitter and funnier than you?

200
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,050
Start running.

201
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,564
Did he say "fitter"?

202
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,568
- What did you find out?
- Woodall's resurfacing.

203
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,125
- Me, too. When?
- Next week.

204
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,969
- Me, too. Where?
- SEC.

205
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,844
- Me, too. Title?
- Supervisor.

206
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,764
- Director.
- Me, too.

207
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,928
I just threw that in to make sure
you weren't yes-maning me.

208
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,405
- Talk to me.
- I found out the name

209
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,683
of the man Woodall's sending after us.
Jeff Malone.

210
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,924
Jeff Malone is a beast.

211
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,010
Well, the only way to beat a beast
is with a bigger beast.

212
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,644
I need to get in there
before everyone else

213
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,570
and let Harvey and Jessica know that
I had the foresight to look for it,

214
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,842
the cunning to find it,
and the balls to stop it.

215
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,050
- Then, you take on Malone.
- Next stop, name partner.

216
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,362
Pearson, Specter, Litt.

217
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,565
Okay, you know what? Just... Let's not
count our chickens before they hatch.

218
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,445
But just for shits and giggles,
say it one more time. Leave out Specter.

219
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,484
Donna, I got Paul Porter's
annual restructuring proposal.

220
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,570
Can you file it under
"I don't give a shit"?

221
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,846
What about Mike?

222
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,849
You want me to have Rachel prepare
a dog and pony show for him?

223
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,849
- That won't be necessary.
- Why not?

224
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,850
Harvey, I need to talk to you right now
about something very important.

225
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,200
Harvey, wouldn't it be necessary?

226
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,322
Because you don't beg
the girl to go out with you.

227
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,044
You wait. She'll call.

228
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,487
- That's not even...
- Excuse me, hold on a second.

229
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,843
- Um, what if they don't call?
- They always call.

230
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,291
Well, what about people
who aren't you?

231
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,448
- You mean you?
- Yeah, of course I do.

232
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,610
If they don't call, then they don't call.

233
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,690
But once they smell your desperation,
they won't respect you

234
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,086
and you'll never get
what you want, anyway.

235
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,851
I'm sorry. Did you want
to talk to me about something?

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,206
It can wait.

237
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,890
Come to think of it, tell Rachel
when she's back from school,

238
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,241
she can have the rest
of the day off.

239
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,926
Harvey.

240
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,084
You do that, you might as well send Mike
a telegram that says,

241
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,043
"I'm not putting any thought
into your idea."

242
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,924
Yeah, might as well.

243
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,602
Okay, are you sure that's
how you want to play this?

244
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,926
Didn't I just answer that?

245
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,842
You did. But this isn't about
whether or not Mike calls back.

246
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,849
This is about you not letting
Mike call the shots.

247
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,486
I let him call the shots, all he's going
to do is shoot himself in the foot.

248
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,807
Maybe. But if this was
anybody other than Mike,

249
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,490
- you wouldn't be acting like this.
- Bullshit.

250
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,931
I don't let Tony Gianopolous
push me around.

251
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,405
You think I'm going to let Mike Ross?

252
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,090
No, of course you don't
let Tony push you around.

253
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,885
But I've never seen you
mock one of his ideas.

254
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,485
Yeah, because his ideas
aren't ridiculous.

255
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,370
This is Mike's first big idea.

256
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,960
And I just told you
his first big idea sucks.

257
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,447
And if you use Rachel
to deliver that message,

258
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,005
- this is going to end badly.
- Okay.

259
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,441
Thanks, Mom, but I think I'm going
to keep playing ball in the house.

260
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,882
Okay. Act like a child
who doesn't want to be told what to do.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,923
But Mike's a client and you need
to start treating him like one.

262
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,566
Donna, the next time I need help
figuring out how to treat a client,

263
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,923
- I'll let you know.
- Okay, great.

264
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,929
Harvey, what can I do for you?

265
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,923
There's a Jeff Malone waiting
in the conference room,

266
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,765
wanting to see both of us.
Any idea who he is?

267
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,724
I've run into him before.
He's a hot shot at the SEC.

268
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,042
- What do you think he wants?
- Let's go find out.

269
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,970
Ms. Pearson.
And you must be Harvey Specter.

270
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,969
- I'm Jeff Malone.
- I know who you are.

271
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,243
- My question is "why are you here?"
- You seem hostile.

272
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,967
You investigate publicly traded
companies. We're not publicly traded.

273
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,605
No, but your clients are.

274
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,485
- Hence his question and our hostility.
- Our?

275
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,843
We tend to stick together when an
uninvited guest interrupts our dinner.

276
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,689
Well, I didn't bring any wine.

277
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,768
But, uh, when I go, I hope
you'll be happy that I dropped by.

278
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,166
Yeah, I doubt that.

279
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,729
So, why don't you tell us which client
you're here for and be on your way?

280
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,241
All of them.

281
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,369
Since when does the SEC

282
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,324
go around intimidating law firms
by going after their clients?

283
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,967
They don't, but they will when Eric
Woodall starts there next week.

284
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,560
He comes at our clients
after what he did.

285
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,724
This time, he won't get fired.
He'll end up in jail.

286
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,962
Except it won't be
Woodall who's coming.

287
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,526
- It will be him.
- Exactly.

288
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,080
Listen, I'm going to be getting
a vaguely-worded assignment

289
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,885
with the not-so-vague agenda
of getting up your clients' asses

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,809
with the full power of the SEC.

291
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,969
And when they ask why,
and they always ask why,

292
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,721
I'm going to be expected to tell them that
it's because they're clients of your firm.

293
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,921
Why are you telling us this?

294
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,929
Because he doesn't want
to work for Woodall.

295
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,684
He wants to work here.

296
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,446
I've always heard
how good you were.

297
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,650
It's nice to see it's true.

298
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,730
Anyway, here's the thing.

299
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,009
I'm really tired of
being a public servant.

300
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,091
And more importantly, I've always
thought that Eric Woodall was a, um...

301
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,011
Oh, shit, I'll just go ahead
and say it. He's a dick.

302
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,049
Finally, something we can agree on.

303
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,481
Seems to me the only thing
left for us to agree on, Harvey,

304
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,682
is my starting salary.
(LAUGHS)

305
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,203
I'm just kidding. I'm sure all your
new senior partners get paid the same.

306
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,250
Before you start picking out floor
patterns for your new office,

307
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,528
I'd like to discuss this
with my partner first.

308
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,130
I'd expect nothing less.

309
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,561
Oh, uh, just one more thing.

310
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,089
I haven't been formally given this
assignment yet, so I have no conflict.

311
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,721
But in one more week, I will,
which means this offer will be gone.

312
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,006
Is that a threat?

313
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,124
I would never threaten someone that
I want to be in business with, Jessica.

314
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,969
It's just the truth.

315
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,367
I like him.

316
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,964
- How did it go with Harvey?
- It didn't.

317
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,649
What do you mean "it didn't"?

318
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,647
You're the only man here
who can take on Jeff Malone.

319
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,411
- How could he not see that?
- I didn't bring it up.

320
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,921
Louis, winter is coming.

321
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,965
I know. And I'm the Night's Watch.
But right now, we need to be patient.

322
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,284
- Patience is not your strong suit.
- Well, today, it is.

323
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,368
Because if there's one thing
that I've always known

324
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,962
is that you don't call the pretty girl.
You wait for her to call you.

325
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,650
Louis, I'm seeing someone.

326
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,451
I'm happy for you, though I have no idea
why you're saying that right now.

327
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,564
Katrina, trust me. They're going to find
out about Jeff Malone soon enough,

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,206
because he's going to come calling.

329
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,886
And when he does, they're going
to come right over to me.

330
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,889
Like him all you want,
I'm not hiring him.

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,490
- Why not?
- Why do you think?

332
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,649
Because you don't like making decisions
staring down the barrel of a shotgun.

333
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,524
Jessica Pearson, nice to meet you.

334
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,889
Jessica, the man walked in here
and offered to fight for us.

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,971
- If it's not him, who's it going to be?
- The guy in the office next door.

336
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,402
Louis?

337
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,884
Harvey, Louis knows everything
there is to know about the SEC.

338
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,451
He's damn good and you know it.

339
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,762
This guy isn't damn good,
he's a killer.

340
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,570
And he's a prosecutor.
We need a defender.

341
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,205
If I'm in a dark alley,

342
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,971
I'd take the killer over the defender
seven days a week.

343
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,208
And Eric Woodall's going
to put us in a dark alley.

344
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,322
Louis is a known quantity.

345
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,568
And right now, Jeff Malone's
biggest selling point

346
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,889
- is telling us that Woodall is coming.
- Louis sure as hell didn't.

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,445
Which means he either didn't know

348
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,609
or he wasn't man enough to come
in here and take the job for himself.

349
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,690
Harvey, do you know why I don't like
being strong-armed into decisions?

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,810
Because I'll never be able to trust
the person who did it.

351
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,888
Then, figure out a way
to get someone as good

352
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,401
or hire this guy
and come to terms with it.

353
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,330
Because if it's Louis against
Malone in a street fight,

354
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,363
I'm picking that dude.

355
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,645
Oh. Thank you.

356
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,847
Hey, how'd your meeting go with
the mysterious Harvey Specter?

357
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,928
Being a dick doesn't
make you mysterious.

358
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,883
Well, then, I guess
you're an open book.

359
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,002
You know, I was going to give you
those Daft Punk tickets.

360
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,009
But now, after that,
I think I'll give them to Edna.

361
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,964
Okay. First of all, Edna was 63
when Daft Punk was born.

362
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,606
Really? With that skin?

363
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,006
You know what?
I worked hard to get you those things.

364
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,043
- Why aren't you going?
- I dropped the hammer on Harvey,

365
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,288
which means Rachel's going
to be working all night.

366
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,721
Hey. What are you doing here?

367
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,851
Donna texted me
when I was at Columbia.

368
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,802
Mmm-hmm.

369
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,160
And told me that Harvey

370
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,965
gave me the rest of the day off
because I'm kicking ass.

371
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,242
- He's giving you the rest of the day off?
- Mmm-hmm.

372
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,001
So, I figured we could celebrate
over dinner before the concert.

373
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,370
What? Are you jealous 'cause
he never did that for you?

374
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,290
- Um. No, that's great. You pick a place.
- Mmm.

375
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,483
I'll meet you there. I've got to, uh, just
set up some meetings for tomorrow first.

376
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,926
What about The Little Owl?

377
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,326
- Yeah.
- Okay.

378
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,970
Mike, what are you doing here?

379
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,801
You delivered a message,
so, now I'm delivering one.

380
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,800
Pearson Specter
is formally in review.

381
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,004
What did you just say to me?

382
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,930
You want my business?
You're going to have to earn it.

383
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,088
- I have earned it.
- By shitting on my plan?

384
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,407
You don't have a plan.
You're running into a wall

385
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,204
and it's not my job
to crash into it with you.

386
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,561
Crash into it? You didn't even ask me
who I'm going after.

387
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,291
I didn't have to because it doesn't
matter. But go ahead. Who is it?

388
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,322
Gillie Industries.

389
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,363
That's not a whale.
That's a monster.

390
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,922
A man like Walter Gillie
isn't going to listen to a guy like you

391
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,691
offering to save him
with sunshine and rainbows.

392
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,926
That's exactly what you said to me

393
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,042
before I got him to sell me
his distribution centers.

394
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,924
Congratulations,
you got to walk his dog.

395
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,929
That doesn't mean he's going
to let you marry his daughter.

396
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,041
Listen to me.

397
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,922
You want to be my guy?

398
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,487
You stop telling me why I can't do this
and you start figuring out how I can.

399
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,886
I already told you how you can.

400
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,042
You get some money,
start buying some shares,

401
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,289
and you walk in there with a club
and the balls to use it if you have to.

402
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,243
Harvey, when I told you
my plan's happening

403
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,725
whether you like it or not,
I meant it.

404
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,530
I'm interviewing
law firms tomorrow.

405
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,201
You show up with a better attitude and
another move or you just lost a client.

406
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,048
RACHEL: So, you want to talk about it?

407
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,206
Talk about what?

408
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,961
About whatevefs going on
with you and Harvey.

409
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,161
(SIGHS)

410
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,721
Why does everybody think
that I was born yesterday?

411
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,929
I tell you he that he gives me
the rest of the day off work,

412
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,930
you vanish until dinner, and then you're
pissed off for the rest of the night.

413
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,687
- So, it doesn't take a rocket scientist.
- Clearly.

414
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,282
- I meant I love you.
- Mmm-hmm. Nice recovery.

415
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,925
It doesn't get you out
of answering my question.

416
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,805
You really want to know?
I'll tell you.

417
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,888
Harvey was Michael Jordan.

418
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,285
And now it's Lebron's time
and he can't take it.

419
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,488
That's a pretty big accusation to make.

420
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,449
Well, there's more to the story
than you know.

421
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,522
What?

422
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,611
Rachel, come on. I said I didn't want
to get between you two.

423
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,760
What?

424
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,920
Let's just say that you
kicking ass for him

425
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,122
isn't the reason
you got the day off.

426
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,610
- I thought you had law school today.
- I do right after this.

427
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,330
- He told you.
- Did you think he wouldn't?

428
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,691
Look, if you want to send a message
to Mike, go right ahead.

429
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,003
If you want me to send a message
to Mike, tell me when and where.

430
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,725
But please don't ever
use me like that again.

431
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,805
You're right.

432
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,044
I'm what now?

433
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,968
- I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry.
- Is it April Fool's Day?

434
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,004
No, but don't ever let it be said
that I can't admit when I'm wrong.

435
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,804
Then I will stop saying that.

436
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,367
- Didn't you say you have class today?
- I'm on my way.

437
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,201
What was that all about?

438
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,687
- Just some administrative stuff.
- Administrative stuff.

439
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,567
- You and Rachel.
- I don't want to talk about it.

440
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,682
You mean about how everything
I said would happen happened,

441
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,529
and now you realize
I was right the whole time?

442
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,926
No one likes a gloater, Donna.

443
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,486
Well, then, I guess the Harvey
Specter University of Gloating

444
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,601
is gonna have to shut down.

445
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,042
I can still give lectures
on the weekend.

446
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,011
Do you want to hear it?

447
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,921
You were right.

448
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,041
(SIGHS)

449
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,807
Call Ray. I'm going to go let
Mike know I'm his lawyer.

450
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,002
You're going to push
a meeting with me?

451
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,721
Harvey, Logan Sanders
is here to see you.

452
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,441
HARVEY: First of all, I don't
appreciate you stomping

453
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,925
into my office with an attitude.

454
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,485
Yeah, well, I don't
appreciate being put off,

455
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,080
especially when I know that you never
pushed a meeting with my father.

456
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,891
Your father never went to Jessica
to set a meeting with me.

457
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,651
Then, I assume that next
time I call you directly,

458
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,082
- you'll pick up the phone.
- Logan,

459
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,081
let me give you the ABCs of me.

460
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,008
I don't take meetings. I set them.

461
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,487
And my respect isn't
demanded, it's earned.

462
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,084
That's only two things.
What's "C"?

463
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,846
"C" is for people who show me
they know "A" and "B".

464
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,887
Well, since we're
quoting Jerry Maguire,

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,764
all I want is for you
to show me the money.

466
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,964
You just took step number one
towards earning my respect.

467
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,048
- And I dig that about you.
- Great.

468
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,847
Would it be too much trouble for me
to discuss my business now?

469
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,486
Well, I was going to move on
to Crimson Tide, but, yeah, go ahead.

470
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,090
Knock yourself out.

471
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,527
Did you ever hear of a family
called the Winwards?

472
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,881
No. Should I?

473
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,004
In 1950, they were worth
the equivalent of $1 billion.

474
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,408
By 1988, one of them owned
a couple of dry cleaners.

475
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,204
And it didn't happen because
they squandered it.

476
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,209
It happened because
they stayed a dinosaur.

477
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,368
And you don't want
to become a dinosaur.

478
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,201
No. I like to think of
myself as a shark.

479
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,922
- Keep moving forward or die.
- You're talking hostile takeover.

480
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,008
You think I'd be here if I wasn't?

481
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,361
You just took step number two
towards earning my respect.

482
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,407
What's the company?

483
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,809
Gillie Industries.
And I already own 4.9 percent.

484
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,162
Logan, we have to end
this conversation right now.

485
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,322
What are you talking about?
I thought I just earned your respect.

486
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,965
You did, but we have a conflict.

487
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,811
- What do you mean you have a conflict?
- I mean, we have a conflict.

488
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,763
And what are you going
to do about it?

489
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,851
I'm going to go and resolve it.

490
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,850
Well, you'd better do it fast
because I am in on this.

491
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,162
And that means you're either
with me or against me.

492
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,170
And that includes all
$1 billion of my business.

493
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,729
Hey. Prunie?

494
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,322
What is that?

495
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,920
It's a prune smoothie.
I invented it myself.

496
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,201
Rain check.

497
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,681
Louis,

498
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,570
guess who stopped by yesterday

499
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,762
for an impromptu meeting
with Jessica and Harvey.

500
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,530
Please tell me it was Dick Cheney.

501
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,405
Why would you want it
to be Dick Cheney?

502
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,170
Why wouldn't I want
it to be Iron Dick?

503
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,961
Holy shit, I think I know
who you were talking about.

504
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,726
- I think you do, too.
- Is it a certain SEC beast

505
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,286
whose name happens to rhyme
with Schmeff Schmalone?

506
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,166
- Schmess it is and schmess it does.
- Well, schmuck me.

507
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,770
Louis, we have a problem.

508
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,049
What's the problem?
As if I didn't know. (CHUCKLES)

509
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,131
I just got out of a meeting
with Logan Sanders.

510
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,010
Logan Sanders?

511
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,801
- This isn't about...
- About what?

512
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,842
(STUTTERING) Never mind.
What's the problem?

513
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,611
He wants to go after the same company
that Mike pitched me first.

514
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,563
So, what's the problem?
Mike brought it to you first.

515
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,523
- You're obligated to stick with him.
- The problem is,

516
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,722
Mike formally put us in review.

517
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,520
Holy shit. That's why
you're coming to me.

518
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,883
You're going to lose Mike and you want
to know if there's any way around it?

519
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,883
- Is there?
- No. Harvey.

520
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,964
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to drop Mike.

521
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,205
- What happened with Harvey?
- Nothing.

522
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,129
He had an emergency with Mike.

523
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,761
Fine, but don't you think now
is the time to act for yourself?

524
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,928
No, we have a good plan
and we're sticking to it.

525
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,042
They're stewing on Malone.
And the more they stew,

526
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,049
- the...
- The more leverage we have.

527
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,011
BOTH: Name partner.

528
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,642
And as I've said,
all we need to do is be patient.

529
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,889
Well, patience may be
one of your virtues,

530
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,802
but it is not one of mine.

531
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,283
- I didn't want to jinx it.
- You didn't.

532
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,162
Katrina, this is one of the sweetest
things anyone's ever done for me.

533
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,483
I want to make sure you don't waste
your opportunity to get this.

534
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,650
I promise I won't.

535
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,610
Ah.

536
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,246
What are you doing here?
We shouldn't be seen together.

537
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,442
Well, you had no problem
walking into my place of business.

538
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,244
Why should I have a problem
walking into yours?

539
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,761
Because unless you're here to tell me
that I have the job,

540
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,888
then you're putting
my position here in jeopardy.

541
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,765
How do you think I felt when I found
the man that I'm sleeping with

542
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,882
standing in my
conference room?

543
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,851
Jessica, will you please
lower your voice?

544
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,611
Not only that, but you stood there
with a shit-eating grin on your face

545
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,882
and tried to strong-ann me
into giving you a job.

546
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,891
Are you as turned on
as I am right now? (LAUGHS)

547
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,889
- You're not funny.
- Oh.

548
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,762
Why didn't you come to me
first with this?

549
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,803
Because if I had come
to you with this first,

550
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,321
you would have thought I was
trading on our relationship.

551
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,090
- Aren't you?
- No.

552
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,806
And if we weren't together, I would have
gone to both of you. All right?

553
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,206
So, I went to both of you.

554
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,163
Now, it may not
have been perfect,

555
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,849
but there was no perfect way of doing it
unless I hadn't done it.

556
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,446
Now, that sounds pretty perfect to me.

557
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,166
- What are you so afraid of?
- Do I have to draw you a picture?

558
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,601
I'm not the one that made up the saying
"you don't shit where you eat".

559
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,007
Am I the shit or the food
in this little painting of yours?

560
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,610
Because if we're just a fling,

561
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,240
then what difference does it make
whether I work with you or not?

562
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,125
I didn't say we're just a fling.

563
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,369
Then, if there really is a chance for us,
then why not go for both?

564
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,923
Because I've seen what happens when
things go south between partners.

565
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,208
And I'm not willing to put
my business in jeopardy.

566
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,967
- Your business.
- Yes, my business.

567
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,284
The one that I have fought tooth and nail
to keep together.

568
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,563
The same business that you
strolled into with a shotgun

569
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,123
and said, "Marry me
or I'll start shooting."

570
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,607
Jess, if you want me to apologize
for the way that I asked, then I will.

571
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,961
But I don't ask for things
that I don't want.

572
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,807
And what I want is to work at Pearson
Specter and to keep seeing you.

573
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,846
Those two things are not
both going to happen.

574
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,050
Then, I guess you have to decide
what's more important to you.

575
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,683
What we have

576
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,525
or what you have.

577
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,528
Hey, Mike, there's another
prospect here to see you.

578
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,211
But he's late and his tie is too fat.
Should I let him in?

579
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,449
- You tell her to say all that garbage?
- He didn't need to, Johnnie Fat Tie.

580
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,483
Yeah, I guess I have time
for one more meeting.

581
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,601
Mike, I need to talk to you...

582
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,404
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
You've missed the pastries.

583
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,807
- I can call you some up.
- Listen to me.

584
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,802
I came down here

585
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,281
because I wanted to tell you if you want
to run through this wall,

586
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,084
I'm ready to run through it with you.

587
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,361
- Good.
- But I can't.

588
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,568
- What?
- What I can do is tell you

589
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,404
I'm ready to run through another one.

590
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,363
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We have a conflict.

591
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,881
Bullshit. Who is it?

592
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,571
- It's not bullshit.
- Then who is it?

593
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,648
- You know I can't tell you that.
- No, what I know is that

594
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,649
it's very convenient that
you suddenly have a conflict

595
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,047
the day after you tell me that my idea
isn't good enough.

596
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,764
I don't find it convenient at all.

597
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,008
But you put us in review, and now,
I have to go with the other client.

598
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,600
I put you in review because
you refused to get on board.

599
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,291
And I just told you I want
to run through another wall with you.

600
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,129
And we still can if you drop this.

601
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,450
And why should I be the one to drop it?

602
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,371
Because they're not going to
and I have to stick with them.

603
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,050
And I'm telling you,
you're going to lose.

604
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,047
Why, because you're
on the other side?

605
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,366
Because their plan is better.

606
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,811
Says the professional bullshitter

607
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,366
who has a brand new vested interest
in me bowing out.

608
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,686
I'm going to let that go.
But if you don't let this go,

609
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,531
I can't represent you
on anything until it's over.

610
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,610
Then I guess we're done here.

611
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,571
You cook?

612
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,365
You come home to this in your kitchen
and that's what you're going to ask me?

613
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,041
Well, I was going to ask you
how the hell you got into my apartment,

614
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,128
but I knew you weren't
going to tell me.

615
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,165
Do you remember when you told me

616
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,681
I should think about taking
some morning meetings?

617
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,361
I can't say that it's
never crossed my mind,

618
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,966
- but you really think it's a good idea.
- Jeff Malone.

619
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,966
Well, he's not my type.

620
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,129
You've got to be kidding me.
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

621
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,362
Because I wasn't going
to hire him yesterday,

622
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,845
so it was none of your business.

623
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,570
But today, I might.

624
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,727
So, now, it is.

625
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,127
And you want
to know how I feel about it.

626
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,321
You're my partner.

627
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,442
Well, I already told you
how I feel about hiring him.

628
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,131
- This doesn't change that.
- Good to know.

629
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,448
Seems like something else
is on your mind.

630
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,607
He doesn't just want
to work together.

631
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,169
He wants us to keep seeing each other.

632
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,163
And you don't want to risk
the one to have the other.

633
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,009
No, I don't.

634
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,523
- I've been there.
- I know.

635
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,485
Then, you need to figure out
which is more important.

636
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,040
I guess I do.

637
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,609
So, you two have, uh...

638
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,521
Yes.

639
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,003
So, he's seen you naked?

640
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,005
That's usually how
these things work.

641
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,600
Are you picturing me
naked right now?

642
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,567
Maybe.

643
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,041
- Yes.
- Go wash your hands.

644
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,611
And don't spend too much time
in that bathroom.

645
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,441
JONATHAN: Let me get this straight.

646
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,925
You come to me with a killer idea,

647
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,930
and all of a sudden you don't want to do
it anymore because you lost your BFF?

648
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,850
I don't want to do it
because it's not a killer idea anymore.

649
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,928
- Why the hell not?
- Because Harvey has a conflict,

650
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,088
which means somebody already
has a dog in the fight.

651
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,531
- Who gives a shit?
- I do.

652
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,564
Because whoever it is
is already buying shares.

653
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,729
You didn't come in here to give up,
you came in here to get my money.

654
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,881
You're damn right I did.

655
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,490
I give you my money
and now I have downside.

656
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,284
Jonathan, look.

657
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,045
You said you wanted a home run.

658
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,161
You've got to pull out your checkbook
because I can't compete without it.

659
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,169
- You could yesterday.
- Now, it's today.

660
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,760
And you're still going in there,
another banker in a suit,

661
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,882
hoping he'll trust you
based on nothing.

662
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,490
I've got more than nothing.

663
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,805
What the hell are you talking about?

664
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,009
Trust me. I did my homework.

665
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,006
Batter up.

666
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,321
What are you doing here?

667
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,529
I said I'd tell you what we were going
to do with your centers

668
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,051
five seconds after we closed.

669
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,447
- When did we close?
- About three seconds ago.

670
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,562
I guess we better hurry.

671
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,521
All right. What's going
to happen to my employees?

672
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,401
We're going to sell your distribution
centers to a pharmaceutical company.

673
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,091
As distribution centers.

674
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,364
They use your workers. They hit
the ground running. Win-win.

675
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,409
You're a man of your word.

676
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,890
But that's not
why you're here.

677
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,280
No, it isn't.

678
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,483
I'm not interested in selling my business.

679
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,487
I know that.

680
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,520
Because I know why you've thrown
your whole life into this company

681
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,166
and why you chose
the movie business in the first place.

682
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,045
What's your point?

683
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,041
Phillip.

684
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,121
Yburson.

685
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,444
You loved watching movies together.

686
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,970
That's why you started this company

687
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,924
and why you won't let go of what
it's become for any amount of money.

688
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,166
How do you know that?

689
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,889
I told you. I do my homework.

690
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,163
You lost him,
and you needed an outlet.

691
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,920
And that's what this
company is to you now.

692
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,330
- Your family.
- I told you, I'm not selling.

693
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,967
And I told you, they're coming after you
whether you like it or not.

694
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,882
And the difference between me and them
is they want to tear your company apart,

695
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,087
and I want to keep it together.

696
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,561
You don't have the resources to do that.

697
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,004
Yes, I do.

698
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,562
As of an hour ago, I started investing.
So, by this time next week,

699
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,007
I will own 4.9 percent.

700
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,280
I didn't have to tell you that.

701
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,323
And that's supposed
to make me trust you?

702
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,962
I lost both of my parents
when I was 11 years old.

703
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,090
So, I know a little something
about needing family.

704
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,006
Walter.

705
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,124
I can't guarantee you we'll win.

706
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,848
But I can guarantee you that
I will never sell you out.

707
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,005
All right, I'm in.

708
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,930
Listen, Zane, I want that goddamn filing
on my desk nine seconds ago

709
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,929
or you can forget
you ever worked here.

710
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,611
Now, excuse me. I've got to go
be a dick to someone.

711
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,007
Sit down.

712
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,401
(SIGHS)

713
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,202
Is this about you and Mike?

714
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,283
Listen to me. This is
going to be a street fight,

715
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,087
and there's only going to be one man
standing when it's over.

716
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,925
- So, I'm only going to ask you this once.
- You don't need to.

717
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,361
I don't want out. I want in.

718
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,411
And when I said, "You want me to send
a message to Mike?", I meant it.

719
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,002
I was just going to ask

720
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,168
if you were comfortable
getting me coffee in the mornings.

721
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,289
I'm serious. I didn't back down
from a fight with my dad,

722
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,846
and I'm not going to back
down from one with Mike.

723
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,887
Good.

724
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,687
Now, I actually am
going to get coffee.

725
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,326
Great. One sugar, splash of cream,
and don't skimp on the hazelnut.

726
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,965
Too soon.

727
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,887
Instead of failing to be channing,
why don't you do something useful

728
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,890
and get moving on drawing up
a tender offer for Logan Sanders?

729
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,889
Logan? Don't you mean Max Sanders?

730
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,082
No, I keep forgetting that you're
in law school half the time.

731
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,608
Max is retired. It's Logan's show now.

732
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,605
LOGAN: You wanted to see me?

733
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,850
- We need to move up our timeline.
- Well, I'm buying shares as fast as I can.

734
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,200
I'm talking about a tender offer.

735
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,802
The plan is shock and awe.
If we rush a tender offer,

736
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,809
we won't have enough leverage
to force people to vote with us.

737
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,082
It's fine to have shock and awe
when you're the only one in the game.

738
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,841
But Walter Gillie knows we're coming
and he got himself an ally.

739
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,406
How do you know that?

740
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,570
Because I do.

741
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,611
- Your conflict. Who is it?
- I can't talk about it.

742
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,326
- Well, when the hell can you?
- In another hour.

743
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,967
(SIGHS)

744
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,729
You have it for me?

745
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,401
Harvey, you know you can
still get out of this if you want to.

746
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,329
Mike's not going to sign that thing
if you tell him not to.

747
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,171
- It's too late for that.
- (SIGHING) Oh, my God.

748
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,009
Hey. Just the woman
I wanted to see.

749
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,600
Donna, would you happen to have the
measurements to Hardman's old office?

750
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,881
Louis, get out of my way.

751
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,402
- Whoa. What's going on, Donna?
- What's going on?

752
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,648
That bullshit Harvey told you
about waiting for the girl to call?

753
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,128
It's bullshit.
He waited and now it's too late.

754
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,685
Change of plans. Cancel anything
you have. We're staying here all night.

755
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,881
- What for?
- The SEC is coming,

756
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,889
and Jessica's hiring
one person to fight 'em,

757
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,367
and first thing tomorrow we need
to convince her that person's me.

758
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,127
Hey.

759
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,011
- I see you have the movies.
- Mmm-hmm.

760
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,283
I guess that means you've decided which
relationship you want us to have.

761
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,280
I have.

762
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,005
But it's not what you might think.

763
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,002
If you still want the job,

764
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,011
it starts tomorrow.

765
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,201
I do.

766
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,441
Then, tonight is our last night.

767
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,326
We'll see if you still think
that in four hours.

768
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,126
Oh, you want to go three times?

769
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,248
No, I was including one of the movies.

770
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,842
- No.
- No.

771
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,684
You finally got yourself an office.

772
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,529
Maybe you forgot but I had an office
before. I just gave it back.

773
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,008
I remember, as a show of loyalty.

774
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,806
Yeah, well, that was then.
This is now.

775
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,763
What you got there, Harvey?

776
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,167
You think you could meet with
Walter Gillie and I wouldn't find out?

777
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,602
No, I knew you'd find out.
I just didn't care.

778
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,443
Then, maybe you won't mind
signing this.

779
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,011
Let me guess.

780
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,528
You want me to waive
the conflict that you still have

781
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,324
after hearing my plan first.

782
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,766
I sure didn't come here
to see your shitty office.

783
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,605
Aren't you supposed to be nice
to the person you need something from?

784
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,411
They're still coming
whether you sign it or not.

785
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,127
But if I don't sign it,
they won't be coming with you.

786
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,887
True.

787
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,646
Of course, if you don't sign it,

788
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,688
it may cause some people to say
you're afraid of me.

789
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,643
And by some people, I mean me.

790
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,763
Of course, if I sign it
just because you said that,

791
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,645
then it might cause some
people to say you baited me.

792
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,766
But I knew you were coming

793
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,924
the second I went
to see Walter Gillie, so...

794
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,890
I went ahead and signed one for you.

795
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,169
- I guess it's on.
- I guess it is.

796
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,888
You think we need
to lay out some ground rules?

797
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,924
Rules? In a knife fight?

798
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,646
I guess somebody ought to yell,
"One, two, three, go."

799
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,763
One, two, three, go.

800
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,323
You know, usually when
someone gets a new office,

801
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,807
you're supposed to
bring them something, right?

802
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,801
Like, an orchid or something?

803
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,802
No? Nothing?

804
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,160
(DOOR CLOSES)

805
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,808
- You signed the waiver, didn't you?
- You know I did.

806
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,730
- I couldn't back down from Harvey.
- Hmm.

807
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,970
And I suppose you
got Gillie on board with your plan?

808
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,323
I wouldn't have needed to sign
the waiver if I didn't.

809
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,526
Hey.

810
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,162
Hey, it's going to be okay.

811
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,810
This thing between me and Harvey,
it doesn't have to affect us.

812
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,445
We won't let it.

813
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,408
I didn't know that Logan Sanders took
over his father's company until today.

814
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,284
What does that have
to do with anything?

815
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,687
- He's Harvey's client.
- Yeah? So?

816
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,089
Do you remember when
I told you that I...
