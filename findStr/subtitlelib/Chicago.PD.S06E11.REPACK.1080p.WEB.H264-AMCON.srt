1
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:10,575
I told you to walk it back.

2
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:13,578
Tell Trudy's friend it was me
who got in the altercation,

3
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:15,493
not you... me.

4
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,539
Sarge, listen.
I thought about it.

5
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:19,149
I thought about it long
and hard,

6
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,064
and I justl did what
I thought was best

7
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,587
for you and for everyone else.

8
00:00:22,631 --> 00:00:25,416
It's not your job
to protect me, to protect us.

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,331
Why is that?

10
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,440
Why are you the only one that
gets to live by a code?

11
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:32,119
I don't understand.
Boss, this is who I am.

12
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:34,556
I'm always gonna do whatever
I can to protect you all.

13
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,166
It's how I'm built, like Al was,

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,535
like you were,
and I just don't understand

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,126
why you don't get that.

16
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:42,129
Because you're no Al,
and you're not me.

17
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:45,567
You're a kid, got your whole
life in front of you.

18
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:50,528
Well, I can handle whatever
comes my way...

19
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,550
We had one chance to make
this right, you hear me?

20
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:54,358
One and you blew it.

21
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:58,667
- Sarge, listen to me...
- This is my unit, my unit.

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,756
I take the heat,
I take the bullets.

23
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,844
Is that clear?

24
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,456
Is that clear?

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,762
It's clear.

26
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:09,721
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,429
Is Antonio coming back,
Sergeant?

28
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:22,734
It's up to Antonio.

29
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,693
- Bernie.
- Hey.

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,521
Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

31
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:28,684
I live around the corner.
I had to come and risk it.

32
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:30,849
Some cops actually like me,
Hank.

33
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,266
- Yeah, name one.
- You.

34
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,442
Don't confuse "respect" with
"like."

35
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:37,227
Kim, this is Bernie Hoffman,
plays for the other team.

36
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,707
I'm aware of your work.

37
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,772
I thought most defense
attorneys were against Kelton.

38
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:42,580
I prefer mayors who
empower police,

39
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:43,712
not pull their pants down.

40
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:47,150
I gotta run.

41
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,891
Nice to meet you, Kim.
Nice to meet you.

42
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,501
Let's grab dinner sometime,
Hank.

43
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:51,633
Ann would love to see you.

44
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,200
Tell her I said "hey."

45
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:57,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I could have your attention.

46
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:00,120
Thank you.

47
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:03,601
It is a true honor to introduce
this man

48
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:06,735
that I have worked with
for 27 years.

49
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:09,825
He has protected this city
where he was born and raised.

50
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:11,609
He is a true Chicagoan.

51
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:15,178
He is the man that needs to be
Chicago's mayor now.

52
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:18,181
The Superintendent of Police,
Brian Kelton.

53
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:20,575
Thank you, Kate.

54
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,576
Thank you. Thank you all.

55
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:23,273
Thank you all very much.

56
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,276
Before I begin, I want to
acknowledge the rank and file.

57
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,191
Let'slet's show 'em how we feel.

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,721
Thank you, I...

59
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:39,681
I may have just seen
Sergeant Hank Voight

60
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:41,248
crack a smile.

61
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,208
That's real police,
best of the best.

62
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:50,387
Now, my opponents talk about
unifying Chicago.

63
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,870
That's a noble word, unity.

64
00:02:54,913 --> 00:02:59,222
But unity to my opponents means
working with gangs,

65
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:02,225
creating programs
toto help gangs,

66
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,227
and that's just not what
Chicago needs right now,

67
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,622
nor is it anywhere on my agenda.

68
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,581
Coddling criminals will
do nothing

69
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:14,542
to help the law abiding
citizens of Chicago.

70
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:19,286
To be clear, I don't wanna work
with gangs...

71
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,811
I'm gonna crush 'em.

72
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,602
Thank you. Thank you.

73
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,737
All right.

74
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,869
I'll wait to hear from you.

75
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,262
Thank you.

76
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,395
Anything from COPA?

77
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,223
Still investigating.

78
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,225
Thanks, man.

79
00:03:45,268 --> 00:03:46,835
Appreciate it.

80
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,813
Now what do you say we get out
of these monkey suits,

81
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,361
grab a drink and talk about,
I don't know, anything else?

82
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,668
- Think I'm gonna go home.
- Okay.

83
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:56,540
Units in 18 and units on
the citywide,

84
00:03:56,584 --> 00:03:59,369
reports of shots fired
coming from the inside

85
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:02,329
a residence at 224 East Scott.

86
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,895
That's right around the corner.

87
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,507
Hey, Sarge, shots fired
a few blocks out.

88
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:14,558
- You first guy on the scene?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:15,840
- All right, come in the back.
- All right.

90
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:16,952
Come on, let's go.

91
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:30,705
Body.

92
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,452
- Where's cover?
- I got you.

93
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,325
Boss, it's Bernie Hoffman.

94
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:44,632
He's gone.

95
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:05,348
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon now!

96
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,089
Holdstand down, stand down.

97
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,396
Ann, Ann, Ann.

98
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,658
Relax, it's me, Hank Voight.

99
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,399
Put your gun down.

100
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:15,010
It's okay, put the gun down,
it's Hank.

101
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,490
- Hank?
- It's okay.

102
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:19,536
I'm here to help.
Look, it's okay.

103
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,582
- It's okay.
- Hank.

104
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,627
My God.

105
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,368
They shot Bernie.

106
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,935
- It's okay.
- My God.

107
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:28,066
It's okay, I got you.

108
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:32,419
I'm so sorry.

109
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,557
What do you got?

110
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,951
Well, wife's jewelry box
was rifled through,

111
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:45,345
a few drawers were tossed.

112
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,496
No sign of Hoffman's cell phone,

113
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,999
I looked high and low.

114
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,542
And the techs swabbed
Mrs. Hoffman for GSR,

115
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,438
she's clean.

116
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,719
They also did a quick test on
the thirty-aught-six,

117
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,484
it has not been fired.

118
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:55,940
And the shell casings
are from a 9-millimeter.

119
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:57,594
You know, there's no sign
of forced entry,

120
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:59,422
so either the offender
pulled off some kind of ruse,

121
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,969
or Mr. Hoffman knew
the attacker,

122
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,363
was having a meeting in here,
things went south.

123
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,539
Well, I'd say real south,
his jaw is broken.

124
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,062
Yeah.

125
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,822
Well, we know what kind of
people Bernie rep.

126
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,500
Start with his clients.

127
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:14,852
I got a neighbor that saw
a gray Honda

128
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,767
idling outside at the time
of the shooting.

129
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,876
Two African American males
inside, didn't get a good look,

130
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,380
but said they seemed suspicious.

131
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,381
Well, they could have just been

132
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:22,730
looking for a parking spot.

133
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,185
Well, what about PODs
or shot cams?

134
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,883
- Nothing so far.
- All right, keep digging.

135
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:27,691
Yeah.

136
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,040
Sir.

137
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,564
We got word it was
Bernie Hoffman.

138
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,043
- Afraid so.
- What else you know?

139
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:34,698
It's all preliminary now,
nothing solid.

140
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,788
Chance Hoffman knew
the offender, maybe a client.

141
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,486
Either of you talk to him
tonight?

142
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,096
Yeah, I damn sure talked to him.

143
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,707
I thanked him for coming
to the fundraiser.

144
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,666
- How'd he seem to you?
- Good.

145
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,929
We talked Blackhawks and...

146
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:52,542
And then that was it.
It's the last time I saw him.

147
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:53,978
It's unbelievable.

148
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:57,155
We had a roomful of officers
one block from here,

149
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,722
including me.

150
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:01,029
And some animal had the
audacity to...

151
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:07,078
I want no stone left unturned,
Sergeant.

152
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:09,080
Do you get me?

153
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,909
- I get you.
- Good, keep me in the loop.

154
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:13,998
Sir. Ma'am.

155
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,963
So, Bernie Hoffman had
multiple cases in pretrial,

156
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:23,573
including seven homicides.

157
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,445
All seven of those defendants
are in jail.

158
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,142
Yeah, he's also got
23 violent offenders

159
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,250
awaiting their day in court,
and they're all out on bail.

160
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:30,928
All right, did you talk
to his firm?

161
00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:33,191
Yeah, one client stood out,
Andre Griffin.

162
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:35,106
He's a major player in
the Southside Hustlers.

163
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,978
He calls for half of Englewood.

164
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:39,720
Hoffman repped Griffin
on three major drug offenses,

165
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:42,505
two agg assaults... Griffin
walked each time.

166
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,464
Griffin visited Hoffman's
work office.

167
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,770
Apparently behind closed doors
things got pretty hot.

168
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,511
Furniture was thrown,
it was a big fight.

169
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,121
Hoffman told the partners that

170
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:52,230
Griffin was just upset about
a bill, and he cooled off.

171
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,734
All right, you talk to Griffin?

172
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:54,841
Yeah, he's on his way in
right now.

173
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,476
So, Englewood makes sense.

174
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,975
We haven't gotten into
Hoffman's phone,

175
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,653
but techs got into the cloud.

176
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,587
And he got a text message
an hour before he was killed.

177
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,265
It says, "It's a deal.
On my way."

178
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:05,615
And the text originated from
a burner in Englewood.

179
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,922
Maybe Griffin's was the deal
that went south.

180
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,188
Where were you last night?

181
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,624
I was home last night.

182
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:17,801
Were you alone?

183
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,717
Wait, what's this about?

184
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,069
Your lawyer.

185
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,682
Damn.

186
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,553
I don't know nothing about that.

187
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,729
Besides, why would I hurt him?

188
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,252
I liked the guy.

189
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:36,037
He saved my ass plenty of times.

190
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,821
Yeah.

191
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:40,520
When's the last time you talked
to Bernie?

192
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,043
Yo, this is crazy.

193
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:45,089
One thing Bernie taught me,
you get brought in,

194
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,917
you call a lawyer.

195
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:50,138
Well, we're just having
a conversation, Andre.

196
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,662
Law-yer.

197
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,061
I got something from
property crimes.

198
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:02,585
Mrs. Hoffman's stolen jewelry
just popped up at a pawn shop,

199
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:03,804
black male dropped it off.

200
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,085
The caught him on
security camera.

201
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,633
- Where's the pawn shop?
- Englewood.

202
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,069
Check it out.

203
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,681
- Hey.
- You look familiar.

204
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,596
Welcome back, man.

205
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,555
- Thanks.
- Glad you're back.

206
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,557
- Let's go.
- Okay.

207
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:22,039
- Hey.
- Late on my first day back.

208
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,147
It's not a great look, right?

209
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,912
Don't worry about it.

210
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,827
I had to drop my daughter off.

211
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,045
She's seeing a therapist.

212
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,352
Good for her.

213
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:32,136
It's a hell of a thing.

214
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,225
How you feeling?

215
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,270
Ready.

216
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:36,314
Good.

217
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,317
Hey, um...

218
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,624
I had a lot of time in there,
and I did some thinking.

219
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:43,820
There's no way I can let Adam

220
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:44,951
go through with this COPA thing.

221
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:45,996
Antonio, we're way past that.

222
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,761
I know.

223
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:51,242
Look, you say anything now,
we all pay the price.

224
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,332
Hang tight, let the process
play out, understood?

225
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,910
Hey, man.

226
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,956
Adam Ruzek, Chicago PD.

227
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,697
Basir, pawn shop guy.

228
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,133
Is this the jewelry, Basir?

229
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,614
Yup, take it before I change
my mind.

230
00:10:14,657 --> 00:10:16,224
Why, what's it worth?

231
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:19,401
50 thou, give or take.
The kid had no clue.

232
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:21,011
How much did you pay?

233
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,232
500, am I gonna get that back?

234
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:26,974
Well, not anytime soon, sorry.

235
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,671
Yeah, it's a match for
Ann Hoffman's.

236
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:29,977
Fantastic.

237
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,128
All right, I hear you got
this genius

238
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:32,327
on security camera too, yeah?

239
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,111
Yep, right over here.

240
00:10:39,813 --> 00:10:41,728
Does that look like
Griffin to you?

241
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:44,426
No. Maybe his, like, nerdy
younger brother.

242
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,781
Who the hell are you?

243
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,959
Let's see if anything pops
on facial rec.

244
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,880
Busy night, DeVante.

245
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:06,143
You got two priors,
and you're still at it.

246
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:08,145
Persistent.
What'd you do, clear a grand?

247
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:09,799
I was just holding that
for someone.

248
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,019
Well, you hold away,
'cause we don't care.

249
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,414
'Cause we got surveillance
of you in a pawn shop

250
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:19,156
selling this man's stolen
jewelry...

251
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:23,857
Ten hours after that.

252
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,078
I-I found those jewels
in a dumpster.

253
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:31,778
DeVante, stop lying.

254
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:34,824
You're staring down life
for murder.

255
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,173
Now you tell us what happened,

256
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,480
you got a shot at seeing
daylight again.

257
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:39,960
You got the wrong black man.

258
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,352
Okay, who's the right one?

259
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:43,200
'Cause we got witnesses that
say they saw you

260
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:44,921
and another guy outside
that man's house

261
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,053
right before that happened.

262
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:47,358
I never went inside.

263
00:11:47,402 --> 00:11:49,273
So you were there?

264
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,798
No, I didn't say that.
Y'all trying to trip me up.

265
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:56,150
Okay, let's talk about
your cousin, Andre Griffin.

266
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,456
What about him?

267
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,981
Hoffman was Andre's lawyer.

268
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,374
Is that the dead dude's name?

269
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,289
Was Andre with you?

270
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:10,381
Is he the other man
our witness saw?

271
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:17,214
DeVante, you gotta come clean.

272
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,914
Sarge, I got something.

273
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,046
It's important.

274
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,534
So, this is from a CTA
bus cam last night.

275
00:12:32,577 --> 00:12:34,164
The route goes right past
Hoffman's house.

276
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:36,146
This was taken at 942.

277
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:44,807
That's Brian Kelton.

278
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:48,028
He said he last saw Bernie
at the fundraiser.

279
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,944
So, he lied right to our faces.

280
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:52,467
Why?

281
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,872
Under my administration
you're going to see

282
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,874
more police on the street,

283
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,702
more arrests of violent
gang members,

284
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:12,922
more homicides solved,

285
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:16,926
and your neighborhoods
are going to be safe again.

286
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,408
And I understand I have
a long road ahead

287
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:22,410
before I can gain your trust.

288
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,847
We can do better.

289
00:13:24,891 --> 00:13:29,765
But under my leadership,
police reform is working.

290
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,508
And to keep Chicago pointed
in the right direction...

291
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,338
I need your help at
the ballot box.

292
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:39,601
You wanna help us?
Stop murdering our children.

293
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:40,863
All Yeah.

294
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,473
- Yeah.
- That's right.

295
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:43,605
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

296
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,870
Sergeant, how are you?

297
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:49,437
Good.

298
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,569
You got a minute?
100%, walk with me.

299
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:52,808
Got an update on the Hoffman
case?

300
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,616
Well, not exactly.

301
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,010
We're having a little trouble
with our timeline, though.

302
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,446
You know, from the cell phone

303
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,709
we know Hoffman got home
around 835.

304
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:02,885
From the fundraiser, yeah.

305
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,322
As far as we know
he was alone there

306
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:07,455
till the offender showed up
around ten.

307
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,028
I was in there, Hank.

308
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:16,507
Okay.

309
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:17,831
I stopped by for a few minutes.

310
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,294
I was gone by 930.

311
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:21,817
If I saw or knew anything
relevant,

312
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,080
I'd have mentioned it to you.

313
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:27,388
That's a hell of an omission.

314
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,955
Look, I'm not looking to bury
anyone,

315
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:30,478
I'm just working the case.

316
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:38,486
Well, we know that Hoffman
was shot with a 9-millimeter,

317
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:41,924
so... I'll need to see
your service weapon.

318
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,624
It'll be processed anonymously.

319
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,800
I don't wanna see a good
policeman's name

320
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,411
get raked through the mud.

321
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:53,999
I'll make sure somebody
gets it to you.

322
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:58,985
Bernie... was working on
a personal matter for me.

323
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,727
It's none of my business.

324
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,120
Let's keep it that way.

325
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,862
- We're ready to go, sir.
- Good.

326
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,646
- Sergeant.
- Superintendent.

327
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,083
Thanks for the update.

328
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,704
How'd it go with Kelton?

329
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:25,011
Admits he was there,
let's see what his gun says.

330
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,795
Sarge, I talked to
Cook County jail.

331
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,362
I got some potential DeVante
leverage.

332
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:29,972
Patrol pinched his aunt
last night

333
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:31,147
on some drug charges.

334
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,583
She basically violated
her parole.

335
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,411
DeVante's close with her?

336
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:35,736
She's been taking care of him
since he was a shorty,

337
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,414
seen a situation like this
before.

338
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,634
She'll feel like he owes
her one.

339
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,462
- Work it.
- Got it.

340
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:47,511
How much you love
your auntie, DeVante?

341
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,821
Love ain't the right word.

342
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:54,997
I'd be dead without her.

343
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:58,566
Well, she's looking
at six years.

344
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:03,136
Six.

345
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,920
You cooperate with us,

346
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,835
she can be cooking dinner
tonight at the crib.

347
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,145
So, we do know that you were
at Bernie Hoffman's house

348
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,147
last night with another man.

349
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,976
Was that man your cousin,
Andre Griffin?

350
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,152
Hey, listen, I know.

351
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,937
Nobody wants to snitch on
family.

352
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:25,941
But you gotta step up.

353
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,725
Okay?

354
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,901
I think you know you do,
because who do you owe it to,

355
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,686
the woman who raised you

356
00:16:31,729 --> 00:16:33,775
or the punk who put you
in that seat right there?

357
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,956
Were you with Andre Griffin
last night?

358
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,617
Okay, what did you see?

359
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,232
I was outside in the car
the whole time,

360
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:59,061
but Griff told me what
went down.

361
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:01,629
He went there to pick up
something from that white guy.

362
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:03,805
Okay, what was he picking up,
money, drugs?

363
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:05,850
I don't know.

364
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,939
All I know is Griff caught
the guy

365
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,898
recording them with his phone.

366
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:13,858
And the dude said he couldn't
trust no one, got crazy.

367
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:19,690
Griff shot him and tried to
make it look like a burglary.

368
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,524
That's good, DeVante.

369
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,918
Yeah, it's real good.

370
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,704
But we need more than your word.

371
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,625
What do I gotta do?

372
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,600
Yo, something's wrong.
Griffin's never late.

373
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:02,037
If DeVante gets
too squirrelly, Kevin,

374
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,604
you pull him right out of there.

375
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:06,085
Copy that.

376
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,134
What's wrong?

377
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,182
Haven't taken a long-eye
in years.

378
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:19,315
I get it, but Voight wants
you to go slow.

379
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,230
It makes sense.

380
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:26,192
Is that the second time
that blue sedan hit the block?

381
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,802
I'm not sure.

382
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:30,892
Listen...

383
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:35,201
Anytime you wanna talk about,
you know,

384
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:39,118
what went down... I'm here
for you.

385
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,861
Thanks, Kim.

386
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,342
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:55,830
Yo, this ain't working, man.

388
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:00,878
Sarge, this kid's losing it,
man.

389
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,967
It's your call, Kev.

390
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:04,795
I'ma pull him.

391
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:24,206
Yo, Griff's a busy man.

392
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,729
I told you he wouldn't
have time.

393
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,296
DeVante, just go home, okay?

394
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,255
If he contacts you,
you contact me immediately.

395
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,778
You understand that?

396
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:31,972
Is my aunt still gonna be okay?

397
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:33,215
DeVante, just go home, okay?

398
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,657
Kevin, you hit?

399
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,398
I'm good, I'm good. You got him?

400
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:43,921
Go, I got the kid.

401
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,097
God, it hurts, it hurts.

402
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:48,012
Did you see who did it?

403
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:50,189
- Who did it, man?
- No. No!

404
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,367
Police! Stop!

405
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:04,855
Kevin! 10-1, 10-1, officer down.

406
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:08,294
Repeat, officer down,
5650 South Loomis.

407
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,339
It's okay, it's okay.

408
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,906
You stay with me, Kevin.

409
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,690
Stay with me.

410
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,170
You stay with me.

411
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,867
Come on. Come on!

412
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:24,962
- Hey, thanks.
- Yeah.

413
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:27,356
- Any word?
- Nothing.

414
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:33,232
I knew something wasn't right
about that car.

415
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,687
I should have called it out
to Voight.

416
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,819
I don't know how the hell
I missed it.

417
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:36,800
Hey, I missed it too, Antonio.

418
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,280
You gotta let it go.

419
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:40,369
No, this is on me.
I had one job to do.

420
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:42,763
Hey, hey.
You look at me, look at me.

421
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,286
All right, this is not on you.

422
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,524
I need you to keep it together,
okay?

423
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:47,594
Okay?

424
00:20:47,637 --> 00:20:49,683
Okay.

425
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:53,339
Doctor, thank you. Thanks a lot.

426
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,515
Okay, I got good news.

427
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:57,604
Kevin is gonna be fine.

428
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,214
It was a tricky surgery.

429
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,868
They took a bullet out of
his shoulder,

430
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:04,306
but it wasn't life threatening.

431
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,873
The best thing we can do
for Kevin is

432
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,528
get back out there and drag
this prick in.

433
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:10,356
So, I wanna know where we're at.

434
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,358
The, PODs are a negative
for the blue sedan,

435
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,317
but a witness thinks they saw
an African American driving.

436
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,232
Shell casings recovered
from the drive-by

437
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,557
are a match to the gun
that killed Hoffman,

438
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,887
9-millimeter.

439
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,473
Well, that's enough to snatch
his ass up.

440
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:22,629
Sarge, we've been looking.

441
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,326
Griffin's in the wind.

442
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,043
All right, so let's find him,
hunt him down.

443
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,462
Squeeze his crew till it hurts.

444
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,420
Whatever it takes.

445
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,312
Headache, headache.

446
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,939
Chicago PD, let me see
your hands.

447
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,622
- Hands in the air now.
- Get up.

448
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:00,860
- On your feet!
- Get up against the wall.

449
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:03,496
- Turn around.
- Police! Freeze.

450
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:11,939
Hey! Stop! Police!

451
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,436
Antonio!

452
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:33,482
Don't move, I'll light you up.

453
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,703
Get those hands where
I can see 'em.

454
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:38,444
Get out, get out.

455
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,359
- Slow down, man.
- Shut up.

456
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,802
- I'm doing what you say.
- Shut up.

457
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:47,888
Here you go.
Who am I looking at, Kim?

458
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,846
Reggie Watt.
Reggie's on parole for distro.

459
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:53,720
Is that why you ran, Reggie?

460
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:55,461
You holding product?

461
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:57,090
You give me Andre Griffin,
I never saw this bag.

462
00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:00,814
Last I heard he's held up
in the stash house,

463
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:03,425
- 5858 South Racine.
- Okay.

464
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,688
Put your hands behind your back.

465
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,824
Hey, that was a hell of a jump.

466
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,391
You all right, Superman?

467
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,001
Definitely gonna feel it
tomorrow.

468
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:16,849
Listen, you got that baggie
of pills?

469
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:17,831
I'll do the paper.

470
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:19,006
I can handle it.

471
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:20,747
You sure that's a good idea?

472
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,139
Yeah, I can handle it.

473
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,707
Wait, holdhold on.

474
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,405
What, you don't trust me?

475
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,844
Right now with what happened,
no.

476
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,498
Do I love you, Antonio?

477
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,562
Do I want you to beat this
thing for good?

478
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,544
Yeah, this is how I do it.

479
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,515
Thanks. Let's go get this guy.

480
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:54,650
Chicago PD!

481
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,698
Clear.

482
00:23:58,741 --> 00:23:59,873
Crossing.

483
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:14,148
Guys, you gotta get in here.

484
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,716
I found Griffin's bankroll.

485
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,152
That's not the headline, though.

486
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:23,525
What's a gangbanger like
Griffin doing with.

487
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,811
"Kelton for Mayor" signs?

488
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,478
All right, thanks.

489
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:40,957
Hey, guys, techs ran
the envelope

490
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,021
we found at Griffin's
stash house.

491
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,090
Hey, Sarge.

492
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,874
It had 40 grand cash inside,

493
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,156
and there was prints on
the outside of the envelope

494
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,137
and on the cash.

495
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,487
We got a hit.

496
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,837
Kelton.

497
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:54,362
I was hoping he was better
than this.

498
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,409
Yeah, well, he's not.

499
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,499
That son of a bitch been
lying to our faces

500
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:03,110
from the second Bernie Hoffman
got shot.

501
00:25:03,153 --> 00:25:04,372
So, the 40 G's is a payout

502
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:06,069
from Kelton to Griffin
for votes.

503
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,462
Yeah, it makes sense.

504
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,159
I find a legal pad at
Griffin's place

505
00:25:09,203 --> 00:25:11,205
with names and neighborhoods,
places to disrupt,

506
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:12,815
pastors to bribe.

507
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,991
All in the service of helping
Kelton win.

508
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:18,125
Chicago politics never
disappoints.

509
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:20,388
Okay, what happened that night?

510
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:23,565
All right, so, the hotel is

511
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,611
about a block away from
Hoffman's house.

512
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,569
Kelton leaves the hotel
around 930,

513
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:31,007
gets to Hoffman's... 935,
he delivers the cash.

514
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:34,445
The sometime after 1000,
Griffin gets there,

515
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,012
collects the money.

516
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:38,406
- Hoffman's the bagman.
- Yeah.

517
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:40,103
And Hoffman records the meeting,

518
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:41,254
'cause he wants to protect
himself.

519
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:42,932
He doesn't trust Kelton.

520
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,978
Griffin realizes the meeting's
being recorded,

521
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,328
things go south, goodbye Bernie.

522
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,245
All right, we know the who
and the why.

523
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,594
Now we gotta prove it.

524
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,161
Sarge, the way things
are headed...

525
00:25:54,204 --> 00:25:56,206
We follow the evidence
wherever it leads.

526
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,342
This turns back on Kelton,
he ordered it,

527
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,649
even if he just covered it up,
so be it.

528
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,520
We arrest his ass.

529
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:09,568
Anyone got a problem with that?

530
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,183
All right, good.

531
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,576
Let's get back out there.

532
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:26,585
Kevin.

533
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:29,544
Hoyou're out of bed already.

534
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,198
Yeah, well, come on in.

535
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,940
Wow, I was hoping for
a little more drama.

536
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:35,115
A hand hold or something.

537
00:26:35,158 --> 00:26:36,464
I'm sorry, Trudy.

538
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:38,267
You know, you can't keep
a good brother down.

539
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,692
I wasl was really worried.

540
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:51,653
So, don't do that again.

541
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:53,002
Okay?

542
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:55,701
I'm not planning on it.

543
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:59,618
What you got there?

544
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:01,968
Trying to remember the tags.

545
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:06,668
I had it, I lost it.

546
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:09,628
Kept repeating it over and over.

547
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,282
Crazy, 'cause...

548
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,458
It might be my last breath
on God's green earth,

549
00:27:14,502 --> 00:27:18,245
and all I can do is try to
remember a license plate.

550
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,943
This job, boy...

551
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,597
Did you see the driver?

552
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:24,685
No.

553
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,560
But I saw the plates,
it's, Indiana customs.

554
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,654
D-G... I don't know, something.

555
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:38,352
L-16 maybe?

556
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:39,832
But hey, it's a start.

557
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,185
How's DeVante?

558
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:50,625
Kevin, he died on the table.

559
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,240
We any closer to Griffin?

560
00:27:57,284 --> 00:27:59,503
No, but, you know, maybe

561
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,680
your partial will help
get us there.

562
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,437
D-G-L-1-6.

563
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,702
- We're in business.
- What's up?

564
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,355
Atwater was one letter off.

565
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:27,662
I got a blue Taurus sedan
reported stolen,

566
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,185
Gary, Indiana, two weeks ago.

567
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:30,380
- You got a VIN?
- Yeah, give me one sec.

568
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:31,666
I'll call the techs.

569
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,712
Superintendent,
how can I help you?

570
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,626
I'm just checking in
with the Sergeant.

571
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,627
Don't let me get in your way.

572
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,064
Superintendent.

573
00:28:39,108 --> 00:28:40,129
Sergeant, I apologize I didn't

574
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:41,260
make it over to the hospital,

575
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:42,392
but I understand Officer Atwater

576
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,765
is feeling better.

577
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:45,369
- Yes, he is.
- Progress on the shooter?

578
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:50,076
Chasing leads.
Can you excuse me a minute?

579
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,642
Yeah, 100%.

580
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:53,122
This is Voight.

581
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,440
What's up?

582
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,181
Techs got into the navigation
system.

583
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,115
The shooter's car is parked in
a small apartment complex,

584
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:12,228
address 232 South Watson.

585
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:13,621
Anyone we know live there?

586
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,754
Tenants name is
Deisha Wallace, two priors,

587
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,059
a mom to a one-year-old girl.

588
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:19,105
Father's Andre Griffin.

589
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,824
All right, hopefully
Griffin's with her.

590
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:25,633
Get over there with Adam,
confirm the car, move in.

591
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:26,765
Yeah.

592
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:33,423
What can I do for you, Brian?

593
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,599
Just checking up on
the Bernie Hoffman case.

594
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:37,645
I...

595
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,623
I wanna make sure you have
all the resources you need

596
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,083
to nail the prick who did this.

597
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,868
Appreciate the offer,
we're good.

598
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:47,698
That mean you have a lead?

599
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:49,526
Means we're working the case.

600
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,441
I asked you a direct question,

601
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,574
and I damn sure expect
a direct response.

602
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:55,141
Direct?

603
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:59,623
I'm sorry, it's just
a funny word choice.

604
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,234
Why's that?

605
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,279
Well, 'cause nothing about
this case

606
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:05,847
or your involvement in it
has been direct.

607
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:14,464
Do you have a lead suspect,
Sergeant?

608
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:16,815
Like I told you, sir,
we're working the case.

609
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:22,559
You're playing a dangerous
game here.

610
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:27,347
So are you.

611
00:30:42,449 --> 00:30:44,320
Why do I get the feeling
I'm investigating

612
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:45,669
the end of my career?

613
00:30:45,713 --> 00:30:47,236
Yeah, well, we stick to
the truth,

614
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,455
we should be all right.

615
00:30:48,498 --> 00:30:49,898
Like the truth matters
these days.

616
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,893
Why does Kelton need Griffin's
vote anyway?

617
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:53,416
He's just some drug-slinging
punk.

618
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,698
But he's a punk that can
help deliver

619
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,376
half the South Side vote.

620
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,508
Yeah, I know, but, still.

621
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,356
Politicians and gangs
have been in bed together

622
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,643
in this city since Al Capone.
It's Chicago.

623
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:04,471
- There it is.
- Yeah.

624
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:05,864
New tags?

625
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,343
Bullet holes.

626
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,302
All right, we're 100%
on the car.

627
00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:10,303
We're gonna sit right back here.

628
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:11,347
Jay, do your thing.

629
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:12,871
Yeah, copy that.

630
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,890
Hi there, ma'am.
I'm Jay, building maintenance.

631
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,805
You don't look familiar.

632
00:31:34,849 --> 00:31:36,392
I've worked for the building
for, like, two years.

633
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,852
Come on.

634
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,332
What you want?

635
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,396
We got reports of a gas leak,

636
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,943
from this floor.

637
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,616
So, we're just going around,
we're checking the units.

638
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,748
It's only gonna take, like,
five minutes.

639
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:45,947
And it's freezing outside,

640
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,731
so we don't wanna evacuate
you guys.

641
00:31:47,775 --> 00:31:48,926
You know, we're justwe're
looking out for you.

642
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,560
Which other units?

643
00:31:50,604 --> 00:31:51,953
It was 212, Ms. Diaz.

644
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,392
All right. Hurry up.

645
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:57,785
It's a cute kid.

646
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,613
Come on, baby, it's okay.

647
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:03,922
Aw. Baby hungry.

648
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,781
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sunrise.

649
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,978
You son of a bitch.
You ain't no maintenance man.

650
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:43,962
Drop it. Your child is here,
I don't wanna hurt you.

651
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,572
- Drop it.
- Jay, you good?

652
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:46,810
I'll be better when she puts
this knife down.

653
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,985
We're not gonna ask you again.

654
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,750
One... two...

655
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:06,027
Look, I swear I ain't seen
Griff in days.

656
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:07,637
I don't know where he is.

657
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:09,683
Stop lying, Deisha
it's not helping.

658
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:13,034
We got the car you stole
at the scene of this homicide.

659
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:15,428
We recovered a bullet
from the officer who pursued.

660
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:16,472
You're facing murder.

661
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:17,996
I didn't kill no one.

662
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:19,736
I don't know anything about
this.

663
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,043
Deisha, we checked your car
for gunshot residue,

664
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:23,784
it's all over the interior.

665
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:26,439
Y'all insane.
Is this what you do to folks?

666
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:28,069
You say stuff till people
start believing it?

667
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,679
You understand that if
you don't cooperate,

668
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:32,053
you are never gonna see your
kid again?

669
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:33,968
You get that, right?

670
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:38,016
Look at me, Deisha.
Andre is going down.

671
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,453
That's a fact.

672
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,411
You wanna join him,
that's up to you.

673
00:33:45,414 --> 00:33:47,851
Now who was driving
your car yesterday?

674
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:51,029
Come on.

675
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,903
Andre.

676
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,557
He dropped me off at work.

677
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,124
But where'd Andre say
he was going?

678
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:00,951
He didn't say.

679
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:02,494
Come on, Deisha, we need more
than that, let's go.

680
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:04,042
What am I supposed to say?

681
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:07,001
We had coffee,
I walked him outside,

682
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,959
I kissed him goodbye,

683
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:11,049
he got in the car.

684
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,877
Last thing I remember
was some big, fancy black SUV

685
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,358
pulled up next to him,
and he started talking to

686
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:17,925
some lady who got out of
the backseat.

687
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,883
All right, what this lady
look like?

688
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:22,886
White lady, blonde hair.

689
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,888
How old?

690
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:26,716
Looked like my mom's age.

691
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,501
She had glasses,

692
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,807
looked like some kind of
college professor or something.

693
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:36,074
Is that her?

694
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,554
Yeah. That's the one.

695
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,964
Sarge, we got the Deputy
Superintendent of Police

696
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:58,313
tipping off our target.

697
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:00,098
I don't know how to proceed.
Bury it.

698
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,142
What?

699
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,883
Keep it out of your paper.

700
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:05,277
It's too hot.

701
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,367
Listen, I'm gonna take
the lead on this, only me.

702
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,195
I'll deal with Brennan.

703
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:11,544
Sarge.

704
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,328
The Glock we recovered
at Deisha's,

705
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:14,652
it's a match for all of
our vics,

706
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,288
Hoffman, DeVante, Kev.

707
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:18,333
I've also got a CI who puts
Griffin hiding

708
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:19,639
at a flophouse on Monroe.

709
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:21,119
We got this prick.

710
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,357
All right, start typing
a warrant.

711
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:23,425
I'll get a judge.

712
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:26,602
We move in hot, fully loaded.

713
00:35:26,646 --> 00:35:29,127
I don't care if he comes out
in a bag.

714
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:36,134
- You ready?
- Yeah.

715
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:44,968
Here we go.

716
00:35:45,012 --> 00:35:46,622
Got eyes on Griffin.

717
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:49,713
All right, standby,
he's pulling up.

718
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:12,692
He's on the phone.

719
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,737
Wait till he gets out, Antonio.

720
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:25,139
Take him.

721
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,363
Chicago PD.

722
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:38,544
Put your hands against the car.

723
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:40,110
Put your hands on the car now.

724
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:42,330
You got me?

725
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:43,374
Yeah.

726
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:56,214
Why are you smiling, Andre?

727
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,260
You think you've won.

728
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:01,349
It's amusing.

729
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:04,570
They can't protect you anymore.

730
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:06,398
You don't know nothing, fool.

731
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:11,229
Let me ask you something.

732
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,187
That funny too?

733
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,669
Where were you when they shot
your cousin?

734
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,714
Answer that.

735
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:21,587
I'm done talking.
My lawyer's on the way.

736
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,420
I hope he's a good one.

737
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,478
Hank.

738
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:48,527
What can I do for you, Kate?

739
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:55,098
I need you to release
Andre Griffin.

740
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:57,710
Excuse me?

741
00:37:57,753 --> 00:37:59,122
I talked to State's
attorney's office.

742
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:00,321
The evidence is weak.

743
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:01,385
There's no fingerprints on
the gun,

744
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:02,802
there were no witnesses.

745
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:06,806
The defense is gonna tear
this case to pieces.

746
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:11,724
Case is strong, so...

747
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:13,552
If there's nothing else...

748
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:14,857
We have an agreement, Hank.

749
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,298
We made it after I helped
Olinsky.

750
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,083
Don't bring Al into this.

751
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:24,345
I told you...

752
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:28,567
I told you there would be
a time when I ask you to

753
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:32,788
solve cases in a hurry
or not... in a hurry.

754
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:34,442
This is one of those.

755
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,536
I know it was you who
tipped off Griffin.

756
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,582
Excuse me?

757
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:46,541
His girlfriend saw you
talking to him

758
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,891
a couple hours before
he killed his cousin.

759
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,418
And tried to kill my man,
Atwater.

760
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,699
I am three generations police,

761
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:56,508
don't question my loyalty.

762
00:38:56,551 --> 00:38:59,162
You're not loyal to the job.
You're loyal to Kelton.

763
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:02,862
I am. He's a good man,
and he's a good cop.

764
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:05,299
He is responsible for my career,

765
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,302
I am not going to let him down.

766
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,435
How long has he been in bed
with the gangs?

767
00:39:10,478 --> 00:39:12,306
With Griffin?

768
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,527
He had absolutely no idea
that Griffin was involved.

769
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,444
- Until Bernie got shot.
- Nobody wants this, Hank.

770
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:20,706
Nobody.

771
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:23,273
When Atwater was in surgery...

772
00:39:23,317 --> 00:39:26,668
I mean, you stood right next
to me, looked me in the eye.

773
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:30,237
You told me you'd do whatever
you can to help.

774
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,848
The whole time you knew it was
Griffin who did the shooting?

775
00:39:32,892 --> 00:39:35,590
All I did was tell him
that he was up for the murder,

776
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:37,438
that the police were
looking at him, that's it.

777
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:40,203
I didn't know that he was gonna
shoot Atwater.

778
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:42,380
You crossed a line.

779
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:44,773
You wanna lecture me about
crossing a line, Hank?

780
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:46,427
This is our line of business.

781
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:48,386
Sometimes we do things
we're not proud of.

782
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:49,909
You know that better than
anyone.

783
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:55,523
What does that mean?

784
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:00,702
You look the other way.

785
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,271
You release Andre Griffin.

786
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,582
Get the hell out of my office.

787
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,640
Thank you.

788
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:29,992
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

789
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,386
Hey, I heard about Griffin.
I thought you might be here.

790
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,929
- Get out of my way.
- Calm down, let it go.

791
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,607
You gotta let it go, all right?

792
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,498
It might as well have been
them that shot Kevin.

793
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,282
- Kevin's gonna be all right.
- That's not the point.

794
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:41,482
I know, you think I like this?

795
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,876
Calling them out in public
makes you look bad.

796
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:46,444
These two are more dangerous
than ten Griffins.

797
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,403
So, we gotta be smart,
and we gotta be patient.

798
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,752
We're playing
the long game here.

799
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,278
This is Chicago.
