00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:08,166
[Alice] Dark's nothing to be afraid of.

2
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:12,125
In fact, I'd go as far as saying
there's nothing to be afraid of.

3
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,208
Anywhere.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,375
The strongest person is the person
who isn't scared to be alone.

5
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:23,416
It's other people you got to worry about.

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,750
Other people. They'll tell you what to do,
how to feel… [scoffs]

7
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:30,041
Before you know it…

8
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,708
[scoffs] …you're pouring your life out
in search of something

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,166
other people told you to go look for.

10
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,375
Someday, you're gonna be all alone,

11
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,041
so you need to figure out
how to take care of yourself.

21
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:35,666
Hello.

22
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,083
[man] Beth Harmon?

23
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:39,958
Yes.

24
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,958
Uh, this is Harry Beltik.
Uh, from the Kentucky State Tournament.

25
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,458
No, I remember.

26
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,541
I hear you dropped one to Borgov.

27
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,750
I wanted to give condolences.

28
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,583
Thanks.

29
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,375
What were you playing, white?

30
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,583
-Black.
-Oh, it's-it's better that way.

31
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,708
I mean, if you're gonna lose.

32
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,125
Suppose so.

33
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,375
What did you play?

34
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,375
Closed Sicilian.

35
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,500
Rossolimo? Really?

36
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,791
I let him do it to me.

37
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:12,833
That's a mistake.

38
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:17,541
Uh, look, I'm in Lexington for the summer,
and I thought maybe…

39
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:19,375
Maybe what?

40
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,916
Would you like some training?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,083
I-I know…
I know you're better than me.

42
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,375
But if you're gonna play the Soviets,
you need help.

43

Where are you?

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm on my way to the Phoenix Hotel.

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,541
I’m moving to an apartment on Thursday.
I could come by then.

46
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,250

Excuse me, miss.

53
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,458
What happened to that gawky kid
who kicked my ass five years ago?

54
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:25,625
[chuckles]

55
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,375
Apparently, she grew up.

56
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,583
A.I. Deinkopf.

57
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,166
Middlegame Strategy.

58
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,250
I've read that one.

59
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,500
J.R. Capablanca, My Chess Career.

60
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,583
That one, too.

61
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:57,333
Fornaut, Alekhine's Games 1938 to 1945.

62
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,250
Yes.

63
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,833
Meyer, Rook and Pawn Endings.

64
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,916
I know, you've read it.

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,833
No.

66
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,625
But I have my own copy upstairs.

67
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:14,500
Well, some of these
are gonna be new to you.

68
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,208
Capablanca played on intuition.

69
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,750
And his natural gifts,
which obviously were considerable.

70
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:22,458
Unlike Bogoljubov and Grünfeld,
who memorized everything.

71
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,583
Yeah, I know how you feel about them.

72
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,375
I read your piece in Chess Review.

73
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,583
Nice cover photo, by the way.

74
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:36,125
I see players at tournaments
after their games have finished,

75
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,958
sitting there studying opening variation

76
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,125
or middle-game strategy, endgame theory.

77
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,375
-Like it would have made a difference.
-You don't ever study?

78
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,000
I analyze games.

79
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,041
What actually happened,
not what could have happened.

80
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,041
-And I play it by ear.
-Like Capablanca.

81
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,500
-He would have beaten Borgov.
-Mmm, not every game.

82
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,208
Mmm, every game that counted.

83
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,291
[both chuckle softly]

84
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,791
-You think I'm a prima donna, don't you?
-It's chess.

85
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:05,958
We're all prima donnas.

86
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,708
So, I've replayed your match
with Benny Watts a dozen times now.

87
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,333
Why?

88
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,833
-That's ancient history.
-Well, it's not that ancient.

89
00:06:17,166 --> 00:06:19,291
-I'm a different player now.
-In some ways.

90
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,750
[Beltik chuckles]

91
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,041
You're stubborn, so you get mad.

92
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,375
When that happens,
you can only see what's in front of you.

93
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,000
Anger clears my head.

94
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,708
Anger is a potent spice.

95
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:33,416
A pinch wakes you up,
too much dulls your senses.

96
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,333
Where'd you get that from,
a fortune cookie?

97
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,541
Mrs. Grecco, my second grade teacher.

98
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:38,916
-Ah.
-Mm.

99
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,458
But the point is still valid.
You've got to stay open.

100
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,291
If you get locked into one idea,
like this king knight pawn, say,

101
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:47,208
it's death.

102
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,500
Look.

103
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:58,166
-Now, the knight pawn is pinned.
-So?

104
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,000
So you got to move the king now,
or you get stuck later.

105
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,083
I can see that, but--

106
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,458
But look at the queen-side pawns,
way over here.

107
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,250
-He could do this.
-Try it.

108
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,708
See?

109
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,541
It's a good sequence.

110
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,291
It’s from Alekhine.

111
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,625
I'm saying I got it from a book.

112
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,083
I know what you're saying.

113
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,291
[chuckles] Let's eat.

114
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,416
You're not the same person
you were five years ago, either.

115
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,750
-No?
-No.

116
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,291
But I can't figure out what's different.

117
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:01,583
Um, I've become more profound?

118
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:02,500
That's not it.

119
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,083
And I, um, got my teeth fixed.

120
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,333
-Yeah, that's it.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,291
It's the teeth. It was driving me crazy.

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,875
I used my tuition money.

123
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,291
My parents are plenty ticked off about it.

124
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,291
It was worth it.

125
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,250
[clears throat] Uh, I should go.

126
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,958
Uh, I'll leave my board here.

127
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,416
I'll take this.

128
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,750
I'll be back in the morning
with more books.

What seems to be the trouble?

138
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,708
[woman] Well, it's difficult to show you
the symptoms at the moment, because…

139

it comes and it goes.

140

[man] Oh, it comes and goes?

141
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,083
[woman] Yes, it's so unfortunate.

142
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,375
It's always the same
whenever I see a doctor.

144

Okay, tell me, what was your endgame?

To beat you?

-I don't know what it was.
-Exactly, you're still just improvising.

150

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,166
So modest.

155
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,375
But I'm nowhere close
to what you'll face in Paris.

156
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,666
I could beat Borgov
with a little more work.

157
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,291
You can beat Borgov with a lot more work.

158
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:37,666
Years more work.

159
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,625
Borgov's not some
Kentucky ex-champion like me.

160
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,541
He is a world champion

161
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,958

Read the games from Leningrad, 1962.

167
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,541
Look at the way he plays
rook-pawn endings.

168

Hey.

[sighs] Breakfast is almost ready.

363
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:11,208
I have taught you everything I know.

364
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,916
Which, admittedly, is not a lot.
[chuckles]

365
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,333
I've got to start studying.

366
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,291
I'm supposed to be an electrical engineer,
not a chess bum.

367
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:26,333
Where are you gonna go?

368
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,125
I'm moving to that apartment.

369
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,958
It's closer to the university.

370
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,791
-I'm gonna leave you--
-You're wrong, you know.

371
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,916
You've taught me a lot.

372
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,958
I'm really glad you called.

373
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:50,250
I'm glad I could be here with you,
you know?

374
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:52,791
After you lost your mom.

375
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:54,833
It's more than that.

376
00:24:58,083 --> 00:24:59,291
You've really helped me.

377
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,291
I guess you've helped me, too.

378
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:05,375
You've helped me realize something.

379
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,250
What?

380
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:09,916
That I don't love chess.

381
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,125
No, it's okay.

382
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,875
I just don't love it
as much as I once did.

383
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:20,875
I'm not obsessed with it
the way one has to be to win it all.

384
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,208
The way you are.

385
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,041
I'm gonna leave you…

386
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,083
this.

387
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:34,416
You have a lot in common.

388
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:36,708
[Beth] Really?

389
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:40,166
Morphy was a lawyer or something,
in New Orleans.

390
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,583
You look at his games,

391
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,416
the way he played.

392
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:48,333
He sacrificed knights and bishops
like he had a dozen instead of two,

393
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:52,500
and then he'd move in on the king so fast,
his opponents would just freeze up.

394
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:57,625
It's too bad Morphy and Capablanca
hadn't been alive at the same time.

395
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,958
They could've played each other.

396
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,500
Yeah, it's too bad Morphy
fell into a muttering paranoia and died.

397
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,208
He would stay up all night,
in Paris, before his games,

398
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,041
drinking in cafes,
and talking with strangers.

399
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:18,958
And then he'd play
the next day like a shark.

400
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,083
Well-mannered, well-dressed,
moving the pieces

401
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,833
with these small, ladylike hands.

402
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:30,500
Crushing one European master
after another.

403
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,250
You know what they called him?

404
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,708
"The pride and the sorrow of chess."

405
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,416
And then he retired at 22.

406
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:46,583
-And you think that's gonna be me?
-I think that is you.

407
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:49,875
I think maybe…

408
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,833
it's always been you.

[Benny] Now, most players, they lack
the courage in their convictions.

445
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:48,541
The key is to not be tentative.
You have to play with absolute confidence.

446
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:49,791
I can tell, on the first move,

447
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,875
whether someone's got that or they don't,
just from how they move that first piece.

Nice to meet you.

502
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,791
Actually, we met.
You beat me the other day.

Learned a lot from it, so thank you.

-Maybe you're right.

No, I know I'm right,
and Beth sees things the same way I do.

514

The pawn move is too weak, right?

515
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:36,125
The pawn move
only works if he plays his bishop.

00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,041

00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,416
Fine.

532
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,583
One game.

533
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,083
-Got it?
-All right.

534
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:31,291
[Benny] Okay.

535
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,791
Shall we say…

536
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,041
five bucks a game?

537
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:40,958
-I haven't even had my coffee.
-Well, look, here it comes right now.

538
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,333
-There you go.
-Thank you.

539
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,583
All right, you take a sip of that coffee,
and I'll punch your clock.

540
00:36:58,208 --> 00:36:59,500
Go ahead.

541
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:01,541
[button clicks]

542
00:37:40,916 --> 00:37:42,125
[exhales]

543
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:50,375
Again?

544
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,416
Again?

545
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:35,916
Again?

546
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,291
-[pieces clacking rapidly]
-[button clicking]

547
00:38:41,791 --> 00:38:44,916
[Benny sighs deeply]

548
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,041
[sighs]

549
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,916
Again?

550
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
[breathing heavily]

551
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
[shoes clatter to floor]

552
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,125
[pensive music playing]

553
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:24,750
[objects clatter]

554
00:39:43,666 --> 00:39:46,291
-[man 1] I need to see proof.
-[man 2] Calling me a liar?

555
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,875
[chatting indistinctly]

556
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,583
It's gonna be you or me.

557
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:23,541
-Are you trying to psych me out?
-No, I don't need to do that to beat you.

558
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,708
Listen, I'm sorry about yesterday, okay?
I wasn't trying to hustle you.

559
00:40:31,791 --> 00:40:33,916
-Weren't you?
-Come on, Beth.

560
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,500
You're the best player here.

561
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:39,166
And I've been watching your games. You…

562
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,125
You attack like Alekhine.

563
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:44,333
You held me off well enough yesterday.

564
00:40:44,916 --> 00:40:46,666
But that doesn't count.
That's speed chess.

565
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,458
I'm better at speed chess than you.
I play a lot in New York.

566
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,875
-You beat me in Las Vegas.
-That was a while ago.

567
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:54,166
You were too hung up on doubling my pawns.

568
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,166
I don't think
I could get away with that again.

569
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,750
Do you ever go over games in your head?

570
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:06,833
When you're alone.
Play all the way through them?

571
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:09,958
Doesn't everybody?

572
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,916
[crowd applauding]

573
00:41:30,166 --> 00:41:32,083
-[button clicks]
-[chess clock ticking]

574
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:34,125
[echoing thud]

575
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,583
Well, I never thought
you'd let me trade queens.

576
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:37,750
I didn't think so, either.

577
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:40,166
Thirty moves, man, Jesus.

578
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:41,916
That many?

579
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,958
Hmm.

580
00:41:44,541 --> 00:41:46,208
Looks like you can outdrink me, too.

581
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,125
[music playing softly in background]

582
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,416
I really appreciate
how you're taking this.

583
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:54,333
-I'm raging inwardly.
-Well, it doesn't show.

584
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,500
Should never have played
that goddamn bishop pawn.

585
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,458
-No, probably not.
-What are you gonna do about Borgov?

586
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:03,916
I don't know.

587
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:07,291
I don't even have a passport.
Or the right clothes.

588
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,791
I hear it's pretty cold in Paris
that time of year.

589
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,583
I'm not talking about Paris.
I'm talking about Moscow.

590
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:16,666
What, do they not deliver mail
in Kentucky?

591
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,833
What's in Moscow?

592
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,541
The Moscow Invitational.

593
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,541
The US winner gets invited.
You didn't know that?

594
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,833
-[bartender] Yes, ma'am.
-A couple more, please.

595
00:42:29,916 --> 00:42:33,666
-Uh, no, thanks. I'm still on my first.
-Well, I'll drink them both.

596
00:42:35,166 --> 00:42:36,291
Easy there, tiger.

597
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,625
How do I get to Moscow if I go?

598
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,333
Uh, well, I mean, when I went,

599
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:47,291
the Federation paid for my ticket,
and then this church group

600
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,541
covered the rest of it.

601
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:49,750
Did you have a second?

602
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,916
-Weiss.
-Weiss?

603
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,250
-It would be tough to go to Russia alone.
-[laughs]

604
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,791
-[bartender] Here you go.
-Oh, thank you.

605
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,500
You always drink this much?

606
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,541
Sometimes, I drink more.

607
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,083
Who else will be playing in Moscow?

608
00:43:13,875 --> 00:43:17,250
Four top Russians,
and four other countries.

609
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:20,625
If you keep doing this,
you're gonna end up washed up

610
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:21,916
by the time you're 21.

611
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:28,625
I like your hair.

612
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:31,000
Uh-huh.

613
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah, sure you do.

614
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:35,750
What about Moscow?

615
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:40,583
Four Soviet chess players
is a lot of Soviet chess players.

616
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:42,291
Murderous.

617
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,875
But you're the only American

618
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,083
I can think of
that might be able to do it.

619
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,166
I went to pieces
with Borgov in Mexico City.

620
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,625
When do you go to Paris?

621
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:58,458
In five weeks.

622
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:02,041
Well, you'll need a good trainer.

623
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,125
Not Harry Beltik.

624
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:06,958
Someone…

625
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:09,791
-better.
-Mmm.

626
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:13,041
Someone more, um, mature.

627
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,166
Who'd you have in mind?

628
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:19,750
Can you come to New York?

629
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,083
I don't know.

630
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:27,916
You can sleep in my living room,
and you can leave for Paris from there.

631
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,750
That's very nice of you,

632
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,291
but I'm not even so sure
I wanna go to Paris anymore.

633
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:38,041
What are you gonna do instead, huh?
Get drunk?

634
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:41,333
Now that you mention it,
yeah, sounds pretty good.

635
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,291
Beth…

636
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,458
Borgov made me look like a fool.

637
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:49,291
-That's 'cause you weren't ready.
-I don't know if I'm good enough.

638
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:51,041
You're the best there is.

639
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:53,625
You beat me.

640
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:02,458
Okay, fine. I'll come to New York.

641
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:03,375
Great.

642
00:45:06,875 --> 00:45:08,750
We'll leave from here. I'll drive us.

643
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,666
-When?
-Tomorrow. Afternoon.

644
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,333
Once everything here finishes up.

645
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,125
Oh, and about sex…

646
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:20,500
forget it.
