1
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:05,304
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,071
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,075
by something impossible.

4
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:09,512
Run, Barry, run!

5
00:00:09,514 --> 00:00:12,383
My father went
to prison for her murder.

6
00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:16,323
Then an accident made me the impossible.

7
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,863
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

8
00:00:18,865 --> 00:00:22,034
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

9
00:00:22,036 --> 00:00:23,740
and find others like me.

10
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:26,077
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

11
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:27,311
Mom!

12
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:28,612
And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:31,347
I am The Flash.

14
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:33,804
Previously on The Flash...

15
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,408
The night we
trapped the Reverse-Flash

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,011
in the force field, there's no reason

17
00:00:37,013 --> 00:00:38,911
that the containment
system should have failed.

18
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,614
- I've been having these dreams.
- What happens in the dream?

19
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:42,586
Dr. Wells is the Reverse-Flash,

20
00:00:42,588 --> 00:00:44,655
and he kills me.

21
00:00:44,657 --> 00:00:46,722
If this is Dr. Wells,

22
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:48,724
then who have we been
working for this whole time?

23
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:50,995
A completely different person.

24
00:00:50,997 --> 00:00:52,231
Oh, my God.

25
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,233
What the frack?

26
00:00:57,437 --> 00:01:00,938
"Flash missing. Vanishes in crisis."

27
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,440
"After an epic street battle
with the Reverse-Flash,

28
00:01:03,442 --> 00:01:06,341
"our city's very own Scarlet Speedster

29
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:10,347
disappeared in an explosion of light."

30
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:12,281
Barry, look at the date.

31
00:01:12,283 --> 00:01:16,889
April 25th, 2024.

32
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:20,290
Guys, when I fought The
Reverse-Flash at Christmas,

33
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:22,691
he said that we'd be
fighting for centuries.

34
00:01:22,693 --> 00:01:27,297
Wait, you can't really
think that this is from...

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,897
the future.

36
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:33,202
That would means Dr. Wells,
or whoever he is, is also...

37
00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:35,004
From the future.

38
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:37,239
I have to say, I'm really digging

39
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,940
the brighter red suit.

40
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:40,510
And the white on the symbol?

41
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:41,779
That's dope.

42
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:43,180
Wait a second.

43
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:45,281
Suppose we now change
the color on your suit.

44
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:48,217
Will it be because we got
the idea from this picture?

45
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,454
That would mean we're
living in a causal nexus.

46
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,690
This... wow.

47
00:01:51,692 --> 00:01:52,959
This is so trippy.

48
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:56,094
Like, Marty and the Polaroid trippy.

49
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:59,899
Not as trippy as the name on the byline.

50
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:04,503
Iris West-Allen?

51
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:05,704
Mazel tov?

52
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:06,738
Hebrew.

53
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:09,308
Ancient language of the Jewish people.

54
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,680
Uh-uh. What the hell was that?

55
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:14,480
Is someone here?

56
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:15,981
Hello?

57
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:19,019
Good evening, Barry Allen.

58
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,422
Uh...

59
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,758
H-hi.

60
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,693
- You know who I am?
- Of course.

61
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:28,297
Barry Allen, director
of Central City Police,

62
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:29,632
CSI Division.

63
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:30,865
Director?

64
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,497
I guess you get a promotion.

65
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,399
Also known as The Flash.

66
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,433
Founding member of...

67
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:36,435
What are you?

68
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:37,769
I am Gideon,

69
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,569
an interactive artificial consciousness.

70
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:42,040
AI.

71
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:45,207
Sick.

72
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:47,642
You know Dr. Wells?

73
00:02:47,644 --> 00:02:51,544
Yes.

74
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,745
Do you know who he really is?

75
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:55,480
I don't understand the question.

76
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:57,948
I... I mean, what is he doing here?

77
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,947
W-why did he come here?

78
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,014
To kill you.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

80
00:03:12,056 --> 00:03:13,122
Wells is in the building.

81
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:14,588
What? How do you know that?

82
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,255
I put a tracker on his wheelchair.

83
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:18,860
Which, if we're wrong about
him and he is paralyzed,

84
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:19,995
I'm going to hell for that one.

85
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,571
He's in the Cortex.

86
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:27,340
Ask questions fast.

87
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,742
Why did he kill Nora Allen?

88
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:29,876
Because he was angry.

89
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:31,078
About what?

90
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,312
That you escaped.

91
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,583
He's on B level. He's coming this way.

92
00:03:36,585 --> 00:03:38,285
What does he want from me?

93
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,820
For you to be The Flash.

94
00:03:40,822 --> 00:03:41,854
Maybe that's why Wells let

95
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:43,222
the particle accelerator explode,

96
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:45,891
so that you could become The Flash.

97
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,761
Why? I mean, for what reason?

98
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:49,494
Guys, we got to go. He's almost here.

99
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,729
- Hurry.
- All right.

100
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,999
Wait a second. Wait.

101
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:55,904
What if HAL over there tells
Wells that we were in here?

102
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:57,239
That would be bad.

103
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,540
If I can get into its operating system,

104
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,908
maybe I can disable its memory core.

105
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,046
Gideon, can you show us where
your operating system is?

106
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:07,849
Certainly.

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,152
Yeah. Nope.

108
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:14,452
That's not gonna happen.

109
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,886
Guys, he's in the corridor.

110
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,455
Gideon, could you just, like,

111
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,125
not tell him that we were here?

112
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,659
Of course.

113
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,927
I will accept any command
given to me by you.

114
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,494
- Barry.
- Come on.

115
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:25,862
- We got to get out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

116
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:28,567
Why would you accept my commands?

117
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,435
Because you created me.

118
00:04:54,201 --> 00:04:55,234
Good evening, Gideon.

119
00:04:55,236 --> 00:04:56,668
Good evening, Dr. Wells.

120
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,170
Is everything all right?

121
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,074
Everything is fine.

122
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:04,432
- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -
- www.addic7ed.com -

123
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:09,819
Eddie.

124
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,953
- Thank you.
- What's the emergency?

125
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:14,121
Oh, no emergency.

126
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:16,894
I just wanted to, you know, talk to you...

127
00:05:16,896 --> 00:05:17,862
Thanks.

128
00:05:17,864 --> 00:05:18,996
Without Iris around

129
00:05:18,998 --> 00:05:20,633
or Barry around

130
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:24,140
or Cisco around or Caitlin around.

131
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:27,712
So, in other words, you
want to talk to me alone.

132
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,415
What is it?

133
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,884
Right.

134
00:05:31,886 --> 00:05:34,189
Um, so listen.

135
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:36,191
With everything going on...

136
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:39,361
Investigating Wells and
finding out about Barry...

137
00:05:39,363 --> 00:05:41,294
Eddie, you cannot tell Iris about Barry.

138
00:05:41,296 --> 00:05:43,152
This isn't about Barry.

139
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:48,201
I know the timing might seem off, you know,

140
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:51,266
with everything that's going on,

141
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:55,272
but I want to propose to Iris,

142
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:58,439
and I'd like your blessing.

143
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,714
No.

144
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,149
Come again?

145
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,417
No.

146
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:12,752
You do not have my blessing.

147
00:06:16,326 --> 00:06:17,725
That's Barry. We got to go.

148
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:19,359
Joe, I only asked as a courtesy,

149
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,393
out of respect.

150
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:23,697
I don't need your permission.

151
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:24,899
Really?

152
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,299
For three very smart people,

153
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,533
that was really stupid.

154
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:30,203
What if Wells had caught you in that...

155
00:06:30,205 --> 00:06:31,806
- Time vault.
- Thank you.

156
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,775
Okay, I know we've seen
a lot this past year,

157
00:06:33,777 --> 00:06:34,777
but time travel?

158
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:37,045
I did it.

159
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:39,514
- Or I will do it, I mean.
- Excuse me?

160
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:42,253
One of the two speedsters in Barry's house

161
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:44,588
the night his mother died was Barry.

162
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,756
I mean, The Flash. He was there.

163
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:49,661
Which means that one day in the future,

164
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:53,500
Barry will travel back
in time to that night.

165
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:54,586
Okay.

166
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:58,609
Actually, I wasn't talking about that.

167
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:03,084
I kind of already time traveled.

168
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:04,753
- By accident.
- What?

169
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:07,521
I was running to try and stop a tsunami

170
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:08,488
from hitting the city...

171
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,522
When was that?

172
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:11,890
A few weeks ago.

173
00:07:11,892 --> 00:07:13,792
Right before you started
getting those dreams.

174
00:07:13,794 --> 00:07:16,261
Oh, you mean the ones where Wells uses

175
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:18,731
his super-speeding hand
to shred apart my heart?

176
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:20,702
- Those?
- Yes, right.

177
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:23,436
So, what if they're not dreams?

178
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:24,669
What else could they be?

179
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,769
Memories.

180
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:27,669
I'm not following.

181
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:30,174
All right, what if,
that day, Cisco found out

182
00:07:30,176 --> 00:07:32,543
that Wells is the Reverse-Flash,
and then Wells killed him?

183
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,011
But when I ran back a day,

184
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:36,046
I changed the timeline so
that event never happened.

185
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,618
If it never happened,
how can Cisco remember it?

186
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,454
I don't know. I don't know.

187
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:44,558
I think the important thing is, he does.

188
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:52,099
Guys, I think I've got a really bad idea.

189
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,120
Dad, it's been three weeks.
You barely eat or sleep.

190
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,455
You should probably go home at some point.

191
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:13,823
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

192
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:17,524
I'll go home when Barry does.

193
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:23,163
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

194
00:08:23,165 --> 00:08:24,397
Help! My son's coding.

195
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:26,131
They said he was stable.

196
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,234
Barry.

197
00:08:28,236 --> 00:08:29,568
- Oh, my God.
- I need the room.

198
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,104
Just go. I need the room.

199
00:08:33,106 --> 00:08:35,070
How can he be seizing?

200
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,304
He has no heart rhythm.

201
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:39,942
- Starting compressions.
- Epi push. Epi.

202
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:49,379
They can't save him.

203
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,748
But I can.

204
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,483
I know who you are.

205
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:56,484
You're that scientist
that Barry's obsessed with,

206
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:59,020
the one who blew a hole in the city.

207
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,954
Harrison Wells, and interestingly enough,

208
00:09:00,956 --> 00:09:03,258
my facility is the very place
I would like to take him.

209
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,861
You're out of your mind.

210
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:06,831
I'm not gonna try and
convince you with promises.

211
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,165
But, Detective, give me a chance.

212
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:11,333
I think we already know what
you're capable of, Doctor.

213
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:13,002
You hurt a lot of people that night.

214
00:09:13,004 --> 00:09:15,703
So those doctors in
there, they're good enough?

215
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:18,205
The best in the city, best in the country.

216
00:09:18,207 --> 00:09:19,573
Look at them.

217
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:21,273
They have no clue what's going on.

218
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,074
They're baffled, and the reason for that is

219
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:25,042
what's happening inside Barry is a mystery,

220
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,609
and they don't have the tools to solve it.

221
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:28,833
- But you do?
- That's right.

222
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:30,612
Millions of people

223
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:33,380
used to look at my lab,
and what did they see?

224
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:34,447
They saw the future.

225
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,848
Well, let me take that technology,

226
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,184
let me take that know-how into ensuring

227
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:42,391
that your son actually does have a future.

228
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:43,942
Detective.

229
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:47,563
Let me save him.

230
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:55,606
- Hand me the paddles.
- Starting compressions.

231
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:59,644
Then save him.

232
00:09:59,646 --> 00:10:03,586
Charge. 200. Pads.

233
00:10:03,588 --> 00:10:04,987
Joe?

234
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:06,321
Joe, are you listening?

235
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:07,923
Yeah.

236
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:11,597
We... we have to access
Cisco's memories somehow.

237
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,798
Somewhere in his subconscious is the key.

238
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,932
The key to what now?

239
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,302
Getting my dad out of prison.

240
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:20,575
And how are we going to do that?

241
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:23,944
We're gonna get Wells to
confess to killing my mom.

242
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,487
So, this will allow Cisco
to see into his dream?

243
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:37,198
I got the idea from a journal article

244
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:38,838
on lucid dream therapy.

245
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,402
They think it can be used to help people

246
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:41,979
suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

247
00:10:42,004 --> 00:10:44,507
Traumatized, stressed?

248
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:45,964
Check and check.

249
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:47,688
The theory is that it will allow people

250
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,247
to objectively enter their dreams

251
00:10:49,272 --> 00:10:50,973
and face their fears.

252
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:53,264
Still working on the talking part.

253
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:55,888
And you're sure this thing
isn't gonna, you know,

254
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,124
mess with my brain?

255
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,761
Oh, the amount of electricity required

256
00:10:58,763 --> 00:11:00,897
to trigger lucid dreaming is harmless.

257
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,071
Probably.

258
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:04,439
Who's going to be lucid dreaming?

259
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,704
Um...

260
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:09,975
With all of the
meta-humans in Central City,

261
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:12,143
people have been seeing
some strange things...

262
00:11:12,145 --> 00:11:14,212
Things that they don't understand.

263
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:15,980
And it's really just a matter of time

264
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:17,948
before psychological issues develop.

265
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,950
And lucid dreaming will help the doctors

266
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,183
better understand their fears.

267
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:22,617
Intriguing.

268
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:25,222
Of course, you still
need to guide the patient

269
00:11:25,224 --> 00:11:26,624
from the outside, right?

270
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:29,458
Direct them to specific
aspects of the dream.

271
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,394
We're still working on a
communications interface.

272
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:34,832
When we dream,

273
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,199
the middle brain lights up
with electrical activity,

274
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:40,638
whereas the higher brain remains dormant.

275
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,643
Once we find a way to make
both parts of the brain active,

276
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:45,946
then it's just a matter
of finding the frequency

277
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:48,044
that will stimulate the language center.

278
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:50,043
Then the dreamer could speak.

279
00:11:50,045 --> 00:11:51,310
He could describe his dream.

280
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:52,745
- Exactly.
- Or her dream.

281
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:54,081
It could be used for anyone.

282
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,484
Right, it's not gender specific.

283
00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:59,887
I would try a frequency
of 45 hertz to start.

284
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,222
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

285
00:12:01,224 --> 00:12:04,693
Well, you never cease
to impress me, Caitlin.

286
00:12:09,998 --> 00:12:11,064
- Allen.
- Hey.

287
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,397
The Owens case.

288
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,564
I'm still waiting on the fiber evidence

289
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,665
and the ballistics report.

290
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,435
Are you on vacation or something?

291
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:18,071
- No, I'm so sorry, I've
just...

292
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:19,205
I've been distracted by another case.

293
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:20,672
Which is no excuse, I just...

294
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,807
Okay, just get me the reports when you can.

295
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:24,075
There's... there's no rush.

296
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,213
All right. Uh, Captain?

297
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:29,516
Is everything okay?

298
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:32,953
Yeah, since Rob and I
have been planning the,

299
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:35,091
you know, wedding, between the florist

300
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:37,429
and the hundreds of kinds of cake filling

301
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:39,472
and who can sit next to who...

302
00:12:41,567 --> 00:12:44,034
Never get married, Allen.

303
00:12:44,036 --> 00:12:45,636
Right.

304
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
- Oh.
- Iris.

305
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,942
- Barry.
- Hey.

306
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:52,043
Are you okay?

307
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:53,211
Yeah. No. Yes.

308
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:55,246
That was... That was just really weird.

309
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,850
Captain Singh was nice to me.

310
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:59,588
Oh, well, he's in a good mood.

311
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,656
He's about to get married.

312
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:04,093
Lucky him. Yeah, I know, it's...

313
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:07,199
Oh, hey, can I talk to you in private?

314
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,734
It's... it's kind of work-related.

315
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,535
Okay, yeah, now's not a great time.

316
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:12,104
- I'm sorry, I've got...
- Hi, beautiful.

317
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:13,907
Hi.

318
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:15,310
Barry, can I grab you for a second?

319
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:16,813
Absolutely. Yeah.

320
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,683
Okay, well, can you
call me when you're done?

321
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:19,751
It's... it's really important.

322
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:21,654
Yeah. Yeah.

323
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:26,511
What's up?

324
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:33,496
Oh. O-okay.

325
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:35,333
W-what did she say?

326
00:13:35,335 --> 00:13:36,935
Or, wait, you still have it, so,
duh, you haven't asked her yet.

327
00:13:36,937 --> 00:13:38,734
Or you did ask her, and she said...

328
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,637
- I was gonna propose tonight.
- All right.

329
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,873
But I went to Joe to ask for his blessing.

330
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:44,875
- He said no.
- He did? He...

331
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:46,778
- Repeatedly.
- Uh, weird.

332
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,780
I need you to talk to him, find out why.

333
00:13:48,782 --> 00:13:50,049
Uh, Eddie...

334
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,850
Look, I know me asking you like this,

335
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:52,817
it's a little awkward.

336
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:54,252
Yeah.

337
00:13:54,254 --> 00:13:56,153
But you know how heartbroken she's gonna be

338
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:58,955
if she finds out that Joe's not on board.

339
00:13:58,957 --> 00:14:00,022
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

340
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:01,157
Yeah, I'll talk to him, man.

341
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,558
Oh, thanks. I appreciate it so much.

342
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
- Yeah.
- And so will

343
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,660
the future Mrs. Thawne.

344
00:14:06,662 --> 00:14:08,394
Iris Thawne.

345
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:11,997
Sounds pretty good, huh?

346
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,933
I have a feeling she's
gonna want to hyphenate.

347
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,872
Okay, can we go
over this one more time?

348
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:21,377
Yeah, you put the glasses on,
fall asleep, and start dreaming.

349
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:22,945
Not that hard.

350
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,747
Yeah, except I'm pretty
sure I die in this dream.

351
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:26,516
If I go back into it, am
I gonna die in real life?

352
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:27,952
I mean, what are we talking about here?

353
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,219
Is this Inception or Dreamscape?

354
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:30,519
Here. Drink this.

355
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,054
- What, am I five?
- Just drink it.

356
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,357
Okay, I'll drink it.

357
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,458
You're gonna be fine, Cisco.

358
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,829
Mm.

359
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:38,699
Okay.

360
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,003
The glasses are emitting
a low-level delta wave

361
00:14:43,005 --> 00:14:44,405
which should help you fall asleep.

362
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,105
Okay.

363
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,680
I got to warn you, though,

364
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:51,617
usually it takes me a long time.

365
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:53,486
I mean...

366
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:54,820
I'm not saying I'm, like...

367
00:14:54,822 --> 00:14:58,220
an insomniac or any...

368
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:01,490
Ah, so that's how you get him to shut up.

369
00:15:01,492 --> 00:15:03,259
He's entering REM.

370
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:04,393
It's working.

371
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,930
Cisco.

372
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,098
Can you hear me?

373
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,201
You're dreaming, bud.

374
00:15:18,605 --> 00:15:20,939
Okay, I
will take Dr. West to Jitters

375
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:23,610
so you do whatever it is you want to do.

376
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:31,018
Whoa.

377
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,423
Guys, this is mad freaky.

378
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:39,059
Okay, um, where are you?

379
00:15:39,061 --> 00:15:43,728
Um, in the Cortex.

380
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,766
I mean, I know I'm just
dreaming that I'm in the Cortex,

381
00:15:47,768 --> 00:15:51,706
but it feels so real.

382
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,641
What is dream you doing?

383
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:57,611
Caitlin just left.

384
00:15:57,613 --> 00:16:00,393
I asked her to take Wells to Jitters.

385
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:04,383
Why... why do you want
Wells out of the lab?

386
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:08,759
I think he might have
tampered with my work.

387
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:11,832
I need to check.

388
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:14,636
Okay.

389
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:17,505
Okay, I'm walking to the bunker.

390
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,951
Oh, man, I love this shirt.

391
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:26,219
I thought the dryer ate it.

392
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:27,855
Focus, Cisco.

393
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,959
Okay, okay.

394
00:16:30,961 --> 00:16:32,929
All right.

395
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:37,668
Now I'm running tests on
the containment system.

396
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,941
This data... It doesn't make any sense.

397
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:45,545
All the supercapacitors...

398
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:48,746
They were all still fully charged.

399
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:51,681
There's absolutely no
reason that the Man in Yellow

400
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:54,950
should have escaped.

401
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:04,657
Oh, my God.

402
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:07,659
It was just a hologram.

403
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,830
He tricked us.

404
00:17:12,968 --> 00:17:14,866
Hello, Cisco.

405
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,769
Oh, God, Wells is here.

406
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,571
Cisco, it's just a
dream. He can't hurt you.

407
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:24,073
You better be right about that.

408
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:29,613
My name is Eobard Thawne.

409
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,047
Eobard Thawne.

410
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,214
Thawne? Like Eddie Thawne?

411
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:37,017
You killed Nora Allen.

412
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,589
It was never my intention.

413
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,756
Nora? What about my mom?

414
00:17:41,758 --> 00:17:44,961
- He's confessing.
- Cisco?

415
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:49,263
He... he didn't want to kill her.

416
00:17:49,265 --> 00:17:50,956
It was you, Barry.

417
00:17:50,981 --> 00:17:52,335
He was trying to kill you.

418
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,670
His blood pressure's 200
and his heart rate is 147.

419
00:17:55,672 --> 00:17:57,373
Guys, he's losing
higher brain function.

420
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,042
Cisco, you're gonna be okay.

421
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,311
It's just a dream. You're gonna be okay.

422
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,912
I have grown quite fond of you, Cisco.

423
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:05,048
His hand... It's vibrating.

424
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,851
- He's gonna kill me!
- Oh, God.

425
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,419
- He's gonna have a stroke.
- Get him out of there!

426
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,252
In many ways,

427
00:18:11,254 --> 00:18:14,387
you've shown me what it's like...

428
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:15,422
Help me, please!

429
00:18:15,424 --> 00:18:16,455
To have a son.

430
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:17,457
Help me!

431
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,925
Aah!

432
00:18:21,696 --> 00:18:22,995
You're okay.

433
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:25,563
It was just a dream. You're okay.

434
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:31,936
Oh, God.

435
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:34,739
It felt so real.

436
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:40,142
- Barry?
- My mom.

437
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:41,910
That's why it's my fault.

438
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:48,781
Hello?

439
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:51,185
Where are you?

440
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:57,788
Barry.

441
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,029
Barry, are you there?

442
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:01,555
Dr. Wells.

443
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,358
Yeah. It's... sorry, yeah.

444
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,261
It's... it's a bad connection right now.

445
00:19:05,263 --> 00:19:06,694
Where have you been?

446
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:09,364
Uh, we're... Why? What's going on?

447
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:10,366
A fire.

448
00:19:10,368 --> 00:19:12,102
A huge fire just erupted.

449
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:14,072
A fire? Where?

450
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,107
New Brighton.

451
00:19:15,109 --> 00:19:16,512
Bradford Tower High-Rise.

452
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:18,147
I know that building.

453
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:20,185
That's where Captain Singh's fiance works.

454
00:19:20,187 --> 00:19:22,659
On my way.

455
00:19:36,078 --> 00:19:38,314
Now move it! Go!

456
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:40,383
Get those hoses up. Move!

457
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:41,582
And tell dispatch we need

458
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:42,916
as many tankers as this city has.

459
00:19:42,918 --> 00:19:44,786
- What floor?
- 21st.

460
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,590
God. That's where Rob works.

461
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:53,835
Please hurry.

462
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:57,142
Over here!

463
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,647
Dr. Wells, the sprinklers...

464
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:02,982
They're not working.

465
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,350
I see that.

466
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:06,486
Just get everyone out of there, Barry.

467
00:20:06,488 --> 00:20:08,185
No, I can't. I can't save them all.

468
00:20:09,722 --> 00:20:12,689
Dr. Wells, please, what do I do?

469
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,091
You create a vacuum.

470
00:20:14,093 --> 00:20:16,027
Rotate your arms at super-speed.

471
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:17,728
That'll create a wind funnel

472
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,430
that will suck the air
right out of the room.

473
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:26,733
It's making it worse!

474
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:27,933
Barry, listen to me.

475
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:31,802
You need to move your arms faster.

476
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:32,937
I believe in you, Barry.

477
00:21:05,488 --> 00:21:06,784
Rob.

478
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,891
I'm okay. It's okay.

479
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,725
I thought I lost you.

480
00:21:15,295 --> 00:21:16,428
Medic!

481
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,181
Mr. Allen.

482
00:21:33,182 --> 00:21:36,616
Tonight, at the fire,

483
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:39,010
I saw hesitation.

484
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:41,678
I saw you doubting yourself.

485
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,612
Why is that?

486
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:44,614
I don't know.

487
00:21:44,615 --> 00:21:48,186
Uh, I guess I was afraid

488
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:49,700
I couldn't save everyone.

489
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,292
Right.

490
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:55,003
But if there is anything
that I have learned

491
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:56,597
in our time together, Barry,

492
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,965
it is that the only thing
standing in the way of you

493
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:04,573
achieving every goal
that you set for yourself

494
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:06,041
is you.

495
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:10,545
There is no limit to
how strong you will get

496
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:14,415
or how fast you will go.

497
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:18,683
Everything that you need,

498
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:21,721
you already have.

499
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:24,158
Thank you, Dr. Wells.

500
00:22:29,835 --> 00:22:32,535
You know,

501
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:36,941
I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

502
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:38,745
I feel the same way about you.

503
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,894
It's so strange.

504
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:53,596
I mean, I look at him now,

505
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:56,900
and I know that he killed my
mom and he sent my dad to jail,

506
00:22:56,902 --> 00:23:00,570
but, I mean, sometimes he's just so kind

507
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:04,103
in the moment, I actually like him.

508
00:23:04,105 --> 00:23:05,838
But you never did.

509
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,526
- No.
- No.

510
00:23:07,551 --> 00:23:10,341
Well, at least now we know how to trap him.

511
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:14,043
In Cisco's dream, he
confessed to everything.

512
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:16,245
If we can just recreate those conditions,

513
00:23:16,247 --> 00:23:17,146
he'll do it again.

514
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:19,111
Man, Barr.

515
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,814
Taking down bad guys, pulling confessions.

516
00:23:22,816 --> 00:23:24,449
I'm the cop.

517
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:25,952
I'm the one that's
supposed to be doing this.

518
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:27,320
Look, if we're gonna get him to confess,

519
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,855
it has to be with someone
that he truly trusts,

520
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:32,827
someone that he'll genuinely
let his guard down with.

521
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,296
He thinks of Cisco as a son.

522
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:38,697
Well, then we need to do
a better job protecting him

523
00:23:38,699 --> 00:23:41,433
than I did protecting you.

524
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:44,137
I'm not sure what that means.

525
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:45,636
Barry, this is all because of me.

526
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:47,338
No.

527
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,174
I never should've let Wells
take you from that hospital.

528
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:50,943
None of this would've ever happened.

529
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:54,077
If you hadn't let him take
me, I would be dead, for sure.

530
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,716
But even then, I knew
something wasn't right.

531
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:58,986
Everything in my gut was
telling me not to trust him,

532
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:00,321
but I did,

533
00:24:00,323 --> 00:24:02,556
because I was so desperate to see you okay.

534
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:04,058
Joe, this isn't your fault.

535
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,762
It's not your fault.

536
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:09,634
Look, every bad thing
that has happened to us...

537
00:24:09,636 --> 00:24:13,073
All of it... It was him.

538
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:15,646
And now he's gonna pay for it.

539
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:22,448
So, Wells set up a fake showdown

540
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:25,316
with a fake opponent who
was never really there?

541
00:24:25,318 --> 00:24:27,486
He figured if we saw both of them together

542
00:24:27,488 --> 00:24:30,667
it would prove that he
wasn't the Man in Yellow.

543
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:34,376
This all just keeps
getting crazier and crazier.

544
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:38,671
I just talked to Dr. Wells.

545
00:24:38,673 --> 00:24:40,272
He's attending a lecture downtown,

546
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:41,571
won't be back until 5:00.

547
00:24:41,573 --> 00:24:42,972
All right, Cisco, you
know when he gets here

548
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:44,439
you need to be working on the trap

549
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,111
so he sees you set off the hologram.

550
00:24:46,113 --> 00:24:48,282
Hold on, isn't that, in your dream,

551
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:49,984
when everything went all...

552
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:51,653
Kali Ma. Temple of Doom.

553
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,958
Yeah, that definitely happened.

554
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,161
But this time, I'm ready for him.

555
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,694
I originally designed the force field

556
00:24:58,696 --> 00:25:00,698
to keep a speedster from getting out.

557
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,066
But I've reversed it.

558
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,202
Now it won't let one in.

559
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,905
Back up.

560
00:25:25,514 --> 00:25:26,714
Barry, are you okay?

561
00:25:26,716 --> 00:25:29,185
Ah.

562
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:31,524
It works.

563
00:25:31,526 --> 00:25:33,460
Okay, as long as I'm inside,

564
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:35,028
Wells won't be able to get near me.

565
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,664
And I will be in the Cortex

566
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,835
watching and recording
everything that happens.

567
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:40,703
And as soon as we get
the confession we need

568
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,501
to free my dad, I'm moving in.

569
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:44,840
So what do I do?

570
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,475
Wells also threatened Iris,

571
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:47,746
so if something goes wrong here,

572
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,014
we need you to keep an eye on her

573
00:25:49,016 --> 00:25:50,214
until Wells is neutralized.

574
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,911
I'll always keep Iris safe, Joe.

575
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:59,187
- What?
- Come here.

576
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:04,460
So, um, Eddie told me what happened,

577
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:07,063
that you kiboshed his proposal.

578
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,664
That was supposed to be between him and me.

579
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,433
I so agree with that.

580
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:13,868
And I... and I know that we
have a lot going on right now,

581
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,768
and I should definitely be the last person

582
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,770
pleading Eddie's case,
but I don't get it, Joe.

583
00:26:17,772 --> 00:26:19,572
Why did you say no?

584
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:22,143
Because if Eddie proposes to Iris,

585
00:26:22,145 --> 00:26:24,345
she's gonna get caught up in
the moment and the romance,

586
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:25,782
and she's gonna say yes.

587
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,384
What's wrong with that?

588
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:29,975
Again, I don't know why I'm saying this.

589
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,653
Because one day she's
gonna wake up and realize

590
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:33,223
she married the wrong guy.

591
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,292
But she'll stay anyway
because she made a promise.

592
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:37,760
I don't want that kind of life for her.

593
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,462
Or him.

594
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,229
She's got feelings for you, Barry.

595
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:44,995
She may not know how to deal
with those feelings right now,

596
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:47,299
but I know her.

597
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:49,303
They're there. Always have been.

598
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:54,744
You know that, too.

599
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,583
Speaking of, Iris just sent me a 911 text.

600
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:00,418
I'll be right back.

601
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:03,853
Like I said.

602
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,656
- Hey.
- Hi.

603
00:27:07,658 --> 00:27:09,057
What's going on?

604
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,592
Look, Barry, I know it's not a good time.

605
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:12,193
I mean, lately, it never
seems to be a good time,

606
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,998
but I need you to listen to me right now.

607
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,835
Like... like, really listen to me.

608
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,837
Of course. Yeah.

609
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:23,873
Whatever you need to
tell me, I'm listening.

610
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,274
Okay, I mean, I know this is gonna sound

611
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:29,879
really crazy at first, but...

612
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,915
Everything strange that's
been going on in Central City,

613
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,616
it all goes back to that night.

614
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:36,717
The night that the particle
accelerator exploded.

615
00:27:36,719 --> 00:27:38,918
I have gone through
every bit of information

616
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,685
that I've collected
since I started my blog...

617
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:43,655
Every tip, every rumor,
every strange sighting.

618
00:27:43,657 --> 00:27:46,761
Nothing predates the explosion.

619
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:49,098
Whatever was released into
the atmosphere that night,

620
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,365
I think it changed people...

621
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:53,701
Caused them to have powers.

622
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:56,204
And I think that S.T.A.R.
Labs knew about it.

623
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:59,139
I think the Burning Man worked there,

624
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:02,677
and I think that that's how
The Flash got his powers too.

625
00:28:05,047 --> 00:28:07,581
- Uh...
- So what do you think?

626
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:10,352
I...

627
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:12,588
I don't know. I mean,
it's... it's interesting.

628
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,024
Yeah, it's interesting.

629
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,224
It's... there's... there's just...

630
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,058
A big hole in your theory.

631
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,159
Um, you know...

632
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:24,596
I was affected by whatever
was released by the explosion,

633
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:27,467
and I don't have any powers.

634
00:28:27,469 --> 00:28:29,699
- Obviously.
- Right, yeah.

635
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:31,903
Look, I mean, I know that
it's... It's really mind-blowing.

636
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:34,074
I mean, I haven't even talked
to Eddie about it yet, but...

637
00:28:34,076 --> 00:28:36,909
Yeah, you and Eddie... How are...

638
00:28:36,911 --> 00:28:38,977
everything's okay with you and Eddie?

639
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:41,081
Uh, sure. Sure.

640
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:43,920
Yeah, we're great. Why?

641
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,420
Uh, I... Yeah, okay, look.

642
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:50,626
I'm gonna... let me read
over all of this stuff,

643
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,259
and we'll definitely talk about it later.

644
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:54,261
I promise.

645
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:56,030
Just... I mean, this is crazy.

646
00:28:56,032 --> 00:28:58,034
Yeah, okay, just let me just go through it,

647
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:01,435
and we'll talk later, all right?

648
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:03,905
Okay.

649
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:19,490
Hey, Barry.

650
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,257
It's Iris.

651
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,095
I don't know if you can
hear me, but I hope you can,

652
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:29,335
because I really, really
need you to wake up.

653
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,772
Like, the other day,

654
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,640
Detective Pretty Boy came into Jitters,

655
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:41,976
and he asked me out,
and I actually said yes.

656
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:48,046
See, I do dumb things like
that when you're not around.

657
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:58,154
And the house is really quiet without you.

658
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:04,795
I know that the reason that
you came to live with us

659
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:08,934
was awful.

660
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:11,235
But Barry,

661
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:13,839
you made it a home again.

662
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:18,780
You made us a family again.

663
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:22,781
We need you.

664
00:30:22,783 --> 00:30:25,852
I need you.

665
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:37,728
Hello, Dr. Wells.

666
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,563
How was your lecture?

667
00:30:39,565 --> 00:30:43,238
Oh, boring, tedious.

668
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,006
Platitudinous?

669
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:46,707
Couldn't have said it better myself.

670
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:50,477
Um, where... Where's Cisco?

671
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:53,483
Uh, he is in the bunker.

672
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:57,119
He thinks he finally figured
out what went wrong at Christmas.

673
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:00,788
You know, when we were trying
to catch the Reverse-Flash?

674
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,194
Yes, I remember that night.

675
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,562
Well, did he say what he's found?

676
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,397
Nope, just that it was important.

677
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,766
Hmm.

678
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:12,268
Good for Cisco.

679
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,203
Um... okay.

680
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:17,506
Well, maybe I'll wheel on down there,

681
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:18,473
see what he's got.

682
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:21,005
Okay.

683
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:26,913
Here he comes.

684
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:56,581
Hello, Cisco.

685
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,535
You've been busy.

686
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:15,409
You really are incredibly clever, Cisco.

687
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:19,377
I've always said it.

688
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:21,746
You're him.

689
00:32:21,748 --> 00:32:24,613
the Reverse-Flash.

690
00:32:24,615 --> 00:32:26,983
Joe was right this whole time, wasn't he?

691
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:28,685
Good ol' Joe.

692
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,892
Joe West had his doubts all along.

693
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:36,829
Even from that first night in the hospital,

694
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,666
Joe knew something wasn't right.

695
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,100
Cops... as inconvenient now

696
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:43,702
as they will be in a hundred years.

697
00:32:43,704 --> 00:32:46,640
Come on, Cisco. We need a confession.

698
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:49,878
You killed Barry's mother.

699
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,245
I want to know why.

700
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:53,614
It was never my intention to kill Nora.

701
00:32:53,616 --> 00:32:56,154
But from my perspective,

702
00:32:56,156 --> 00:32:59,123
she was already dead.

703
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:01,693
It just happened sooner
than it was supposed to.

704
00:33:01,695 --> 00:33:05,667
No. That's not an admission.

705
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:06,936
Oops.

706
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:15,509
You're not gonna get away with this.

707
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:16,811
I'm not gonna get away with it?

708
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:27,709
Oh, you're smart.

709
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:30,068
You're smart, Cisco.

710
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:36,632
But you're not that smart.

711
00:33:36,634 --> 00:33:38,868
Cisco!

712
00:33:40,874 --> 00:33:42,073
No!

713
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:03,801
He didn't confess.

714
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:06,604
Cisco, are you okay?

715
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:07,553
Yeah.

716
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,508
I'm never ever gonna sleep ever again,

717
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,341
but, yeah, I'm okay.

718
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,581
He's dead.

719
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,682
He didn't confess.

720
00:34:17,684 --> 00:34:19,784
Joe, this was it.

721
00:34:19,786 --> 00:34:21,987
My dad's gonna be in prison forever.

722
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,822
Barry, I'm sorry.

723
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:25,691
Hey, uh...

724
00:34:25,693 --> 00:34:28,827
Whoa.

725
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:30,028
What the hell?

726
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,963
I told you this before.

727
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:37,634
I am always one step ahead... Flash.

728
00:34:37,636 --> 00:34:40,171
Allow me to reintroduce to you

729
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:42,273
Mr. Hannibal Bates

730
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:44,876
and his incredible ability to transform

731
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:48,446
into any person he touches.

732
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,718
I knew that
ability would come in handy.

733
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,320
I did not expect it to
come in handy this soon.

734
00:34:54,322 --> 00:34:56,190
You used him!

735
00:34:56,192 --> 00:34:57,359
Like you used all of us!

736
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,228
Well, he served a purpose.

737
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,529
Didn't take much convincing.

738
00:35:01,531 --> 00:35:04,098
Just the simple promise of his freedom.

739
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,903
You ruined my life! All our lives!

740
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:10,439
We stood by you after
everything that happened.

741
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,407
I can see how this must be
difficult for you to understand,

742
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,075
but trust me,

743
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:18,610
your lives now are so much better

744
00:35:18,612 --> 00:35:21,212
because of what I have done for you.

745
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:22,580
You don't have to hide anymore.

746
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:23,915
We know you're not Harrison Wells.

747
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:25,149
Just tell us who you are.

748
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:28,550
A confession will get you nowhere.

749
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:31,286
You've seen who I am.

750
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:32,322
You know what I can do.

751
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:34,793
You want to kill me, go ahead.

752
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:35,993
I'm not gonna fight you.

753
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:38,493
But just tell the police what you did.

754
00:35:38,495 --> 00:35:39,894
Get my dad out of prison.

755
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:41,428
I don't want to kill you, Barry.

756
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,430
I need you.

757
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,898
And...

758
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,870
I also did not anticipate,

759
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:52,272
as difficult as the past
15 years have been for me,

760
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:55,520
how much I would come
to love working with you.

761
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:57,441
With all of you.

762
00:35:57,443 --> 00:36:01,046
And yet, that does not
change what needs to happen.

763
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:02,948
Then face me now!

764
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,495
Oh, we will face each other again.

765
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,652
I promise you. Soon.

766
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:13,388
Very, very soon.

767
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:16,626
He's in the time vault!

768
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:17,594
Barry!

769
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:36,914
It was all a set-up.

770
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:38,413
We thought we set a trap for him,

771
00:36:38,415 --> 00:36:40,381
but he set a trap for us.

772
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,583
Oh, my God.

773
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:48,926
Iris.

774
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:56,760
We have to find Iris.

775
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:58,096
- Why?
- Wells.

776
00:36:58,098 --> 00:36:59,566
He's been watching all of us.

777
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:01,437
He has surveillance
footage set up everywhere.

778
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:03,505
Our homes, my lab at the police station,

779
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:06,142
Central City Picture News.

780
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,645
Cisco, call me when you have a location.

781
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:16,494
I am very much enjoying this stroll.

782
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,255
We needed a good stroll.

783
00:37:18,257 --> 00:37:20,657
Yeah.

784
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:24,626
Actually, though, would you mind
if we park here for a second?

785
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,893
Um...

786
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:29,627
Oh, it's my dad.

787
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:32,264
Could you call him back later?

788
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,168
Sure.

789
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:35,984
What's going on?

790
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:39,849
Iris, this week, when I was arrested

791
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:42,906
and it looked bad,

792
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,507
you never wavered.

793
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:46,343
You never lost faith in me.

794
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:48,081
Impossible.

795
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:55,118
And even though we've been
through some rough times,

796
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,319
I've never lost faith in us.

797
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:04,126
Iris West.

798
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:05,595
Eddie?

799
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,167
Eddie!

800
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,700
Bad timing, Detective.

801
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,116
Stop! Leave him alone!

802
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:21,486
Iris, no!

803
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,029
I know who you are.

804
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:27,997
You killed Barry's mom.

805
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,900
But you don't have to hurt anyone else.

806
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:36,575
Hey, Iris.

807
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:37,676
It's okay. It's me.

808
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:39,044
He took him.

809
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:40,245
The Man in Yellow, he took Eddie.

810
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:42,248
I promise I will find him, okay?

811
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,585
- What is happening?
- Listen to me, you go home.

812
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:47,555
Don't say anything to anyone.

813
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:50,027
I swear to you, I will
bring him back, all right?

814
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:51,562
Wait, stop.

815
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,901
Barry?

816
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:15,493
You might as well take that mask off.

817
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:18,999
I know it's you, Wells.
Or whoever you really are.

818
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:25,502
Well, allow to to introduce myself.

819
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:29,510
My name is Eobard.

820
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:33,013
Eobard Thawne.

821
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:35,852
I don't understand.

822
00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:38,021
Why do you have my name?

823
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,689
Why?

824
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:44,560
Well, 'cause we're family, Eddie.

825
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:47,564
Funny, I haven't seen you
at any reunions or weddings.

826
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:48,901
That is funny.

827
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:51,505
And the reason for that

828
00:39:51,507 --> 00:39:56,408
is because as far as those
guest lists are concerned,

829
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,477
I haven't been born yet.

830
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:03,451
So that's why you didn't kill
me that night at S.T.A.R. Labs?

831
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:09,258
This whole thing...

832
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,491
It's been about me?

833
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,193
Not a chance.

834
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:15,928
You, my friend,

835
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,096
are simply my insurance.

836
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,501
You look so young.

837
00:40:31,543 --> 00:40:34,879
And I could kill you

838
00:40:34,881 --> 00:40:38,050
right now so easy.

839
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:46,894
What I wouldn't have given...

840
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:52,869
All those times before
to have had you like this.

841
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,737
So...

842
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:56,304
helpless.

843
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:59,905
But fate,

844
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:02,940
it's tricky, isn't it?

845
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:05,841
I come here to destroy you...

846
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:10,482
And then to get home, I have to be the one

847
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:14,217
who creates you.

848
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,692
But I will say,

849
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:24,162
it's been an education...

850
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,102
Watching you grow up all these years.

851
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:33,636
Science fairs and soccer games.

852
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:36,273
No hint, no sign,

853
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:40,210
no trace of the man you will be one day

854
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:43,178
for whom I have nothing but hate.

855
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:45,874
And to be clear,

856
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,890
nothing is forgiven

857
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:53,031
There will be a reckoning.

858
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,075
I promise you, Barry Allan,

859
00:41:58,504 --> 00:42:00,504
that you will die.
