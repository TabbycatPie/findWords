1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,490
...spring training camp and he's definitely got the inside track.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,240
Word is that they're having some problems with injuries.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,990
Really? Are they looking into...

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,540
...free-agent signings last second, anything like that?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,040
Possibly, and they've got a strong farm club too.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,050
They've got some triple-A ballplayers they might bring up.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,840
Peter would certainly be able to tell us more about that.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,340
Who do you like?

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,840
So far, I like what I'm seeing in New York.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,090
They've got a strong ball club, as usual. That's in the American.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,850
And in the National, I'm still liking Chicago...

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,470
...with a little bit of a twist here for Los Angeles.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,520
Okay, so we're looking at New York-Chicago World Series...

14
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,270
-...possible Los Angeles.    -Could be a dark horse.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,360
Hold him to it at the end of the season.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,650
That's gonna do it for us from the Sports Desk.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,730
-Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.    -Thanks for nothing, Eddie.

18
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,590
Thank you, guys. That's not all we're following.

19
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,490
Here's Karen at the Health Desk.

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,080
The world of medicine has seen its share of miracle cures...

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,870
...from the polio vaccine to heart transplants...

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,870
...but all past achievements may

23
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,170
pale in comparison to the work of Dr. Alice Krippin.

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,170
Thank you for joining us this morning.

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,970
-Not at all.    -So, Dr. Krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

26
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,060
Well, the premise is quite simple.

27
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,560
Take something designed by nature and reprogram it...

28
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,060
...to make it work for the body rather than against it.

29
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,860
-We're talking about a virus?    -Yes.

30
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,820
In this case, the measles virus...

31
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,060
...which has been engineered at a genetic level to

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,160
be helpful rather than harmful.

33
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,620
Um, I'm not... I find the best way to describe it is...

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,290
...if you can imagine your body as a highway...

35
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,230
...and you picture the virus as a very fast car

36
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,330
being driven by a very bad man...

37
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,540
...imagine the damage that that car could cause.

38
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,040
But then if you replace that man with a cop...

39
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,510
...the picture changes. And that's essentially what we've done.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,970
Now, how many people have you treated so far?

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,770
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials in humans so far.

42
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,690
-And how many are cancer-free?    -Ten thousand and nine.

43
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,980
So you have actually cured cancer?

44
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,820
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

45
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
What you see? What you see?

46
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,850
Damn.

47
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,020
Let's go, Sam.

48
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,440
Come on.

49
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,760
Good morning, Matt. It's looking great, I'll tell you.

50
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,310
Not only was this the biggest snowstorm in New York City history...

51
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,860
...it had to be one of the prettiest. Imagine waking up on Sunday...

52
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,320
...to 26.9 inches of snow in New York City.

53
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,780
Here you go. Just the way you like it.

54
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,030
Disgusting.

55
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,450
Excuse me, excuse me.

56
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,540
All right. Come on, relax.

57
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,040
However, it did strand planes, trains and automobiles.

58
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,620
There was a report, a Turkish Airlines flight

59
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,420
skidded off the runway at JFK.

60
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,380
No one was injured, but for the most part, Matt...

61
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,550
There you go.

62
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,140
I'm gonna show you, attempting the Bob Hager rule of thumb here.

63
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,770
And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.

64
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,860
In New York, in 30 Rock, we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.

65
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,430
Back to you, Matt and Katie.

66
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,490
Gosh. All right, it looks great.

67
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,990
It'll be beautiful for the next day, at least.

68
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,030
-And then it turns brown.    -If that.

69
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,740
Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.

70
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,410
No, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

71
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,660
Don't just push them around, eat them. I'm not playing.

72
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,290
Good morning. This morning, all up the East Coast...

73
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,440
Okay. You gonna eat your vegetables.

74
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,340
We will sit down here all night.

75
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,420
The biggest challenge is getting back to work.

76
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,410
What are you whining about?

77
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,350
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

78
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,810
Hey. All right, here's the deal. Look. Look.

79
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,220
You're gonna eat twice as many

80
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,770
vegetables tomorrow night. All right?

81
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,940
Deal? Deal?

82
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,280
Come on.

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,290

84
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,630

I'm all right, it's all right.

94
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,270
What's happening?

95
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,270
I tried to reach you on your cell. I get a recording.

96
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,190
-Cell service is down.    -Where are we going?

97
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,940
-Can't get used to the new regs.    -Going to Aunt Sara's.

98
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,820
-Ma! No! Why?    -Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

99
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,990
-We're at 30 minutes, colonel.    -Copy.

100
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,910
-Thirty minutes to what?    -They're sealing off the island.

101
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,170
Seal off the island? This island?

102
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,050
But I don't wanna go to Aunt Sara's.

103
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,030
-Did you bring all the money?    -Yeah.

104
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,530
-How much?    -Six hundred.

105
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,960
Why did you say, "You're going"?

106
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,470
-That's not enough.    -Robert.

107
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,590
You said, "You're going," not, "We're going."

108
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,040
When you get across, I need you to get to the ATM.

109
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,640
Get as much cash as you can.

110
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,630
Take Sara's car, go upstate. I'll meet you at the farm.

111
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,850
Bring enough food for two weeks.

112
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,560
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?

113
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,440
Is it airborne?

114
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,570
But we only go to Aunt Sara's in the summer.

115
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,530
-It may be.    -Oh, my God.

116
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,450
-It's Christmas. What about my presents?    -He's announcing it.

117
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,990
Make no mistake, Americans, this virus...

118
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,080
You left my Christmas presents in the closet.

119
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,250
Hush now, Mar.

120
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,470
...Threatens the survival of not only our nation,

121
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,570
but of every other nation...

122
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,630
-Mommy, look, it's a butterfly.    -Marley, enough!

123
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,340
And so it is with great sadness, but even greater resolve...

124
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,340
...that tonight I have signed an executive order...

125
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,720
...initiating a military quarantine of New York City.

126
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,850
God be with us.

127
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,140
This has been a special...

128
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,570
The window is still open.

129
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,820
We find something in a week or two weeks...

130
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,490
...we can reverse the spread.

131
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,870
I can still fix this.

132
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,830
Please. You can do the same work outside the city.

133
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,630
This is ground zero. This is my site. We talked about this.

134
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,630
What are you doing?

135
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,730
What am I doing?

136
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,390
I'm not gonna let this happen.

137
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,390
Let? This isn't up to you. You can't control...

138
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,440
Daddy, it's a monster!

139
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,060
How'd you sleep?

140
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,280
Look out. Come on, you know better than that.

141
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,950
Uh-uh.

142
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,740
I'll be back.

143
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,660
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012, GA series, serum 391.

144
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,830
Animal trials. Streaming video.

145
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,390
GA series results appear typical.

146
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,860
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

147
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:35,370
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.

148
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,460
Compounds 2, 5, 7...

149
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,880
...12, 13, 15, 17...

150
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,460
...all killed the host.

151
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,340
Hold on a second.

152
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,980
Compound 6 appears to be showing decreased aggression response.

153
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,320
Partial pigmentation return.

154
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,440
Slight pupil constriction.

155
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,910
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6...

156
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,120
...next candidate for human trials.

157
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,830
You hang in there, number six.

158
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,960
Yeah, that's what you want.

159
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,690
Hey!

160
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,780
Good morning, Marge. Good morning, Fred.

161
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,490
What are you guys doing here so early?

162
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,280
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred. Don't set it down anywhere.

163
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,460
I'll see you guys inside.

164
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,040
What's happening, buddy?

165
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,740
Yes.

166
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,970
Good morning, Hank. I'm midway through the G's.

167
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,020
Hey, who's the girl in...?

168
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,570
Never mind. Hey, I'll see you in the morning.

169
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,120
What am I supposed to say?

170
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,450
"Hello.

171
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,220
Wanna see some infected rats?"

172
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:16,210
Okay, tomorrow. I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

173
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,130
Psst.

174
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,280
Come here. Hey. Hey.

175
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,530
Good job. You did so good.

176
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,530
Yes. Yes.

177
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,180
Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

178
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,630
Wow, actual Spam. Yeah.

179
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,770
You'll get some of that later.

180
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,530
Let's go.

181
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,850
Wait.

182
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,640
My name is Robert Neville.

183
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,470
I am a survivor living in New York City.

184
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:18,230
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

185
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,820
I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday...

186
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:25,070
...when the sun is highest in the sky.

187
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,030
If you are out there...

188
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,870
If anyone is out there...

189
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,290
I can provide food.

190
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,210
I can provide shelter.

191
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,170
I can provide security.

192
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,830
If there's anybody out there...

193
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,720
...anybody...

194
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,050
Please.

195
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,970
You are not alone.

196
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,310
Fore!

197
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,870
Yeah.

198
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,380
Keep your eye on this one for me.

199
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,930
Ooh.

200
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:39,520
I'm getting good.

201
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,550
Ss-ss.

202
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,940
Sam! No, no, no!

203
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,490
No! No! Sam!

204
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,430
No! No!

205
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,910
Sam? Sam? Sam?

206
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,660
Sam? Sam?

207
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,040
Sam? Sam?

208
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,340
Hello, Sam?

209
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,050
Sam?

210
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,040
Sam?

211
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,810
Come on. Sam.

212
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,330
I gotta go, Sam.

213
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,630
I gotta go. I gotta go.

214
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,160
Sam?

215
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,730
Sam? Sam?

216
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:44,410
Sam? Sam?

217
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,490
Sam. Sam.

218
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,290
Sam. Sam, come on, we gotta go. Sam.

219
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,830
What are you doing?

220
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,180
Sam, we gotta go!

221
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,940
Sam, go! Go!

222
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,440
Sam, get out! Get out!

223
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,250
You gotta pay attention, okay? You gotta pay attention.

224
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,090
Listen, uh...

225
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:27,180
...I want you to stay here on this one, okay?

226
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:32,310
Because you can still get infected.

227
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,930
And I can't.

228
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,910
So, look, if I'm not back by dark...

229
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,030
...just go.

230
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:36,560
Okay. Subject is female. Likely 18 to 20 years of age.

231
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,060
Dilaudid push only sedates effectively at six times human dose.

232
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:45,060
Core temperature, 106 Fahrenheit. Pulse, 200 bpm.

233
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,430
Respiration elevated.

234
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,420
PA O2, 300 percent of normal.

235
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:59,240
Pupils fully dilated.

236
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:01,750
Nonreactive to light.

237
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,590
Extreme reaction to UV exposure.

238
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,430
Symptoms and tissue samples confirm subject is infected with KV.

239
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,440
Vaccine test.

240
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,920
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6.

241
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,190
Commencing human trials.

242
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,140
Respiration slowing.

243
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,310
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

244
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,020
...105...

245
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,690
...104 and decreasing.

246
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,780
We may have something here.

247
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:04,370
GA series, serum 391, Compound 6 ineffective on humans.

248
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:27,730
Test results linked to this entry saved on six redundant drives.

249
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,890
Still no cure.

250
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,050
Day 1001.

251
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,340
We came in close contact with a hive today.

252
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:56,830
Blood tests confirm that I remain immune to both the airborne...

253
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,420
...and contact strains.

254
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:04,470
Canines remain immune to airborne strain only.

255
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,810
You can't go running into the dark, dummy.

256
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,610
Vaccine trials continue.

257
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:17,860
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity to infected hosts.

258
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,280
The Krippin Virus is...

259
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:23,450
...elegant.

260
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,620
Just fishing in the dark, son.

261
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,510
A behavioral note.

262
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:44,030
An infected male exposed himself to sunlight today.

263
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,970
Now, it's possible decreased brain function...

264
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:54,270
...or the growing scarcity of food is causing them to...

265
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,360
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

266
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,740
Social de-evolution appears complete.

267
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,160
Typical human behavior is now entirely absent.

268
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,550
Why are we stopping?

269
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,050
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

270
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,510
-We got less than 10 minutes.    -Baby, give me the dog.

271
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,130
-Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.    -Daddy!

272
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,610
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

273
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,940
Keep the colonel and his family between us

274
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,440
and don't let anyone stop you.

275
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,030
Mommy, they have guns!

276
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,220
It's okay. They're in the Army like Daddy.

277
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,450
Unless you have clearance...

278
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,040
...you cannot pass the checkpoint. Please return to your homes.

279
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,580
Make a hole, make a hole! Coming through!

280
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,210
Coming through!

281
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,250
Unless you have clearance, you cannot pass the checkpoint.

282
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,460
Please return to your homes.

283
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,510
You're clear. Move ahead.

284
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,970
You're clear.

285
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,720
All right, that's it, move up.

286
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,270
All right, step up.

287
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:57,020
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

288
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,690
No good.

289
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,930
Military quarantine is about to begin.

290
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,990
Come on, step back.

291
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,990
-Military quarantine is about to begin.    -Look, look, look.

292
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,120
-I'm not infected.    -Clear. Good, go on.

293
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,410
I'm not infected.

294
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,990
Please! Please!

295
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,310
Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.

296
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,240
You're gonna have to move back.

297
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,460
-No good.    -Follow me, ma'am.

298
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,960
What? No! Robert! Robert!

299
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,330
Get your hands off my wife. Get your hands off.

300
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:29,840
-Mommy!    -Stand down.

301
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,050
Lieutenant...

302
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,890
-Mommy!    -Scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

303
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,520
Get your hands off of my wife.

304
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,020
-Stand down!    -Scan her again. Stand down!

305
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,810
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

306
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,570
I am Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville.

307
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,570
I am ordering you to scan her again.

308
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,440
Scan her again!

309
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,030
All right, scan her again.

310
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,830
-It's clear.    -It's clear. Move through.

311
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,370
Who's next? Come on.

312
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,460
Take my baby with you! Please! Please!

313
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,840
-Mommy!    -Please take my baby. Please!

314
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:13,040
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

315
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,760
Stay away from the shoreline.

316
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,630
How long?

317
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,020
Five minutes. We'll make it.

318
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,350
This is Ranger 621, we're on site.

319
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,110
Military quarantine is about to begin.

320
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:44,210
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel. You got my word on it.

321
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:50,720
Give me a kiss.

322
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,850
I love you. I love you.

323
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,430
Dear Lord, please watch over Robert...

324
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,940
...and keep him strong through the struggles ahead.

325
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,110
Lord, please just bring him home safely. Amen.

326
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,120
Daddy's gonna make the monsters go away, baby, okay?

327
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,580
Sam, you protect Daddy.

328
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,750
-No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.    -Sir, we gotta go!

329
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,840
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

330
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,760
It's a butterfly.

331
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,330
All right, come on, let's go!

332
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,060
How'd you sleep?

333
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,360
Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look at the ongoing mutations...

334
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,440
...of Dr. Alice Krippin's once-hailed miracle cure for cancer.

335
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:38,740
So far, almost 5000 patients treated with her retrofitted virus...

336
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,240
...have begun exhibiting symptoms resembling

337
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,740
the early onset of rabies.

338
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,710
Twenty-five patients have already died.

339
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,280
Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals

340
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,080
to stockpile antiviral drugs...

341
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,170
...and to begin preliminary quarantine protocols.

342
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,920
It's my birthday.

343
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:58,470
We are fully confident Dr. Neville can see us through these...

344
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,340
You gonna sing?

345
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,680
My name is Robert Neville.

346
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,440
I am a survivor living in New York City.

347
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,190
I am broadcasting on all AM frequencies.

348
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,450
I will be at the South Street Seaport every day at midday...

349
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,450
...when the sun is highest in the sky.

350
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,730
If you are out there, if anyone is out there...

351
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:31,040
I can provide food. I can provide shelter.

352
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:33,960
I can provide security.

353
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:37,980
If there's anybody out there, anybody...

354
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,760
Please.

355
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,390
You are not alone.

356
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,970
Listen, uh...

357
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,520
...if you're planning a party or something, just tell me now.

358
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,560
Okay? Because you know I don't like surprises.

359
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,360
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?

360
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,130
Hey! Hey!

361
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,320
What the hell are you doing out here, Fred?!

362
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,040
What the...? What the hell are you...? No!

363
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,920
No! No!

364
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,460
No.

365
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,460
What the hell are you doing out here, Fred?!

366
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,130
How did you get out here?!

367
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,470
Fred, if you're real, you better tell me right now!

368
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,060
If you're real, you better tell me right now!

369
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,160
Damn it, Fred!

370
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,740
Damn it!

371
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:31,620
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.

372
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:00,310
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

373
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,330
Baby. I'm okay.

374
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,380
I'm okay. I'm okay.

375
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,760
Let's go.

376
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,880
Come on. Sam, come on.

377
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,440
Let's go! Sam!

378
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,450
No! No! Let's go!

379
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,370
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

380
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:53,610
Sam!

381
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,870
No!

382
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,980
Sam? Sam?

383
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:32,110
It's okay.

384
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:35,360
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

385
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,030
You're all right. You're all right.

386
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:41,160
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.

387
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:45,540
Hey. You're okay. You're okay. Samantha.

388
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,870
We just gotta get you home. Gotta get you... Gotta take you home.

389
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,630
Let me take you home. All right, come here.

390
00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:54,250
Come here. Come here. Come here.

391
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,750
Come on. Come here. Come here.

392
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,330
I got you. I got you.

393
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,090
It's okay.

394
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,720
You're okay.

395
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,520
Don't worry

396
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,860
About a thing

397
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:05,070
'Cause every little thing is gonna be all right

398
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:14,170
Don't worry About a thing

399
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,420
Rise up this morning

400
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:25,940
Smiled with the rising sun

401
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,980
Three little birds

402
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,660
I promised my friend...

403
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:46,460
...that I would say hello to you today.

404
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,840
Hello.

405
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,310
Hello.

406
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,570
Please say hello to me.

407
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,210
Please say hello to me.

408
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,290
Die!

409
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,670
Die!

410
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,430
Die!

411
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:47,740
Come on! Stay with me!

412
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,870
Where do you live?

413
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,590
Hey.

414
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,590
Hey!

415
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,880
Stay with me.

416
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,050
Where do you live?

417
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,560
Where do you live?

418
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:10,560
Uh...

419
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:14,940
11 Washington Square.

420
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:18,190
They don't know where I live.

421
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:22,570
Don't... Don't let them track us.

422
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:25,530
You gotta stay out till dawn.

423
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:30,390
No!

424
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,890
Donkey?

425
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:35,980
What are you doing?

426
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,680
I would think of all people

427
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,480
you would recognize a wall when you see one.

428
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:43,630
Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp,

429
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:44,680
not through it.

430
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,730
It is. Around your half, see? That's your half, this is my half.

431
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:51,340
-Oh, your half?    -Yes, my half.

432
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,780
I helped rescue the princess.

433
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,080
I did half the work. I get half the booty.

434
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:58,630
Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.

435
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:00,920
-Back off!    -No, you back off.

436
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:04,170
-This is my swamp!    -Our swamp.

437
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:09,080
-Smelly ogre.    -Fine!

438
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,220
Come back, I'm not through with you!

439
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:12,890
Well, I'm through with you.

440
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:16,180
You know, with you it's always "me, me, me."

441
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,730
Well, guess what, now it's my turn.

442
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:21,430
So you just shut up and pay attention!

443
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:22,840
You are mean to me!

444
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,740
You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do.

445
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,320
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

446
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:32,870
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

447
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:36,220
Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

448
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,250
Oh, yeah.

449
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,750
You're right, Donkey. I forgive you...

450
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,770
...for stabbing me in the back!

451
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:49,260
You're so wrapped up in layers, you're afraid of your own feelings.

452
01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:50,660
-Go away.    -See?

453
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,930
Doing it again, just like you did to Fiona...

454
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,270
...and all she did was like you, maybe love you.

455
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:59,940
Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.

456
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,730
I heard the two of you talking.

457
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,740
She wasn't talking about you, she was talking about somebody else.

458
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:18,250
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

459
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:20,460
Obviously you know that.

460
01:06:21,290 --> 01:06:22,530
They're yours.

461
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:24,370
But I did find bacon,

462
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:27,670
which is about the most fantastic thing in history.

463
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:31,630
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

464
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,180
I put by your plate, because your leg is okay...

465
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:38,560
...but it won't be for very long if you don't start a course soon.

466
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,640
Who are you?

467
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:45,690
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

468
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,910
Don't let it get cold.

469
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,590
It's okay. Go on.

470
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:39,870
We came from Maryland. We heard your message on the radio.

471
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,620
We were at the pier at noon. We waited all day.

472
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:48,040
We're going to Vermont.

473
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:51,380
To the survivors' colony.

474
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:53,550
What?

475
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:58,140
In Bethel. It's a safe zone.

476
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:00,770
There's no survivors' colony, there's no safe zones.

477
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:02,980
Nothing happened the way it was supposed to.

478
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,060
Nothing worked the way it was supposed to.

479
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:06,470
In the mountains.

480
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,820
There's a whole colony of people there who didn't get sick.

481
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:12,530
The virus couldn't survive the cold. There's a colony...

482
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,930
Shut up! Shut up!

483
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:16,530
Everybody's dead.

484
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:18,830
Everybody is dead.

485
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:29,880
I just need... I need a minute. Okay?

486
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,040
Just...

487
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:39,830
I just... I was saving that bacon.

488
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:42,680
I was saving it.

489
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,980
I'm just... I'm gonna go upstairs. All right? Just...

490
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:50,190
I'm gonna go.

491
01:09:08,290 --> 01:09:10,960
Ethan, put the knife down.

492
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:49,870
-You there! Ogre.    -Aye.

493
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,210
By the order of Lord Farquaad...

494
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:54,840
...I am authorized to place you both under arrest...

495
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,760
...and transport you to a designated resettlement facility.

496
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:05,310
Oh, really? You and what army?

497
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:18,240
Can I say something to you?

498
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:21,410
You was really, really something back there. Incredible.

499
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,780
Are you talking to...

500
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:25,950
...me?

501
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:30,620
Yes, I was talking to you. You was really great back there.

502
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:32,740
Those guards, they thought they was all that.

503
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,040
You showed up, and bam!

504
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,460
Tripping over themselves like babes in the woods.

505
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:38,670
That really made me feel good to see that.

506
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,350
That's great. Really. Man, it's good to be free.

507
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:45,350
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?

508
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,630
But, uh...

509
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:50,390
...I don't have any friends.

510
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,060
And I'm not going out there by myself.

511
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:55,860
Wait a minute. I got a great idea. I'll stick with you!

512
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,780
You a mean, green fighting machine.

513
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:01,070
Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

514
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,580
I like Shrek.

515
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:08,160
That was really scary. If you don't mind me saying...

516
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,080
...if that don't work, your breath will get the job done...

517
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,470
...because you definitely need some tic tacs,

518
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,170
because your breath stinks!

519
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:18,230
Man, you almost burned the hair out of my nose.

520
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:19,830
Just like the time...

521
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:24,930
You're not so good with people anymore, are you?

522
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:32,890
Thank you for my leg.

523
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,150
Okay.

524
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:41,780
Where have you been?

525
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:45,570
I was on a Red Cross evacuation ship out of São Paulo.

526
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,830
Those boats weren't meant to be permanent.

527
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,580
No, they weren't.

528
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:53,750
When the Navy fell apart, we started docking to take on supplies.

529
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,670
Someone picked it up on shore. Five of us were immune.

530
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,530
You said five?

531
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:02,550
The Darkseekers got them.

532
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,550
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

533
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,770
It's too late today.

534
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,270
If we leave tomorrow at dawn,

535
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,170
we can make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

536
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,690
-So if you had...    -I'm not leaving.

537
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:26,910
This is ground zero.

538
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,490
This is my site.

539
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:34,660
I'm not gonna let this happen.

540
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:39,130
I can still fix this.

541
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:56,630
-Whoa. You scared me.    -Sorry.

542
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,140
I called down twice.

543
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,940
Oh. Oh, thank you.

544
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:09,230
It's heavily sedated. Don't worry, it's safe.

545
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:12,120
I've never seen one so still.

546
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,410
They're always biting.

547
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,750
You think that can cure her?

548
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,880
Um... No, this will almost certainly kill it...

549
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:28,260
...but it's possible by drastically reducing the body temperature...

550
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:31,430
...I can increase the compound's effectiveness.

551
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:45,030
Did all of them die?

552
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:46,820
Yes.

553
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:51,910
My God.

554
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:56,450
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

555
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:04,130
Where can Ethan sleep?

556
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,690
He's heavy.

557
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:32,990
Can you get that?

558
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,110
She's beautiful.

559
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:09,490
What's her name?

560
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:13,070
Marley.

561
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:18,240
-Her name was Marley.    -It's a beautiful name.

562
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:23,830
Yeah. We named her after Bob Marley.

563
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,340
-Who?    -Uh, the singer.

564
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:30,130
Damian?

565
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:33,430
Uh, his father.

566
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,970
His father.

567
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,180
Nope.

568
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,440
I shot the sheriff

569
01:15:46,730 --> 01:15:49,690
But I didn't shoot the deputy

570
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:02,250
-Oh, that is unacceptable.    -What?

571
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,380
Best album ever made.

572
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:21,810
You don't recognize that?

573
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:24,350
Wow.

574
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:32,070
He had this idea, it was kind of a virologist's idea.

575
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:35,710
He believed that you could cure racism and hate.

576
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:36,940
Literally cure it...

577
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:43,240
...by injecting music and love into people's lives.

578
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,920
One day, he was scheduled to perform at a peace rally.

579
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:52,050
Gunmen came to his house and shot him down.

580
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,220
Two days later...

581
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,470
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

582
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,680
Somebody asked him why.

583
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,940
He said, "The people...

584
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:13,190
...who are trying to make this world worse are not taking a day off.

585
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:16,360
How can I?"

586
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:22,280
Light up the darkness.

587
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:50,520
Come with us, Neville.

588
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:53,150
To the colony.

589
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:59,280
There's no colony, Anna.

590
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,120
Everything just fell apart.

591
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:06,540
There was no evacuation plan...

592
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,040
You're wrong. There is a colony.

593
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,580
I know, okay?

594
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,540
How do you know, Anna?

595
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:21,840
I just know.

596
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:28,230
How? I said, how do you know? How could you know?

597
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:31,270
God told me.

598
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,770
He has a plan.

599
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,110
-God told you?    -Yes.

600
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,030
-The God?    -Yes.

601
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:45,030
-I know how this sounds.    -It sounds crazy.

602
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:49,040
But something told me to turn on the radio.

603
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,790
Something told me to come here.

604
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,750
My voice on the radio told you to come here, Anna.

605
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,960
You were trying to kill yourself last night?

606
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,130
Anna.

607
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,470
I got here just in time to save your life. That's a coincidence?

608
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:02,160
Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.

609
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:04,260
He must have sent me here for a reason.

610
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:08,470
Neville, the world is quieter now.

611
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,730
You just have to listen.

612
01:19:10,890 --> 01:19:13,060
If we listen...

613
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:15,690
...we can hear God's plan.

614
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:17,940
-God's plan?    -Yeah.

615
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:20,650
All right. Let me tell you about your God's plan.

616
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:23,740
There were 6 billion people on Earth when the infection hit.

617
01:19:23,910 --> 01:19:28,490
KV had a 90 percent kill rate. That's 5.4 billion...

618
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:31,120
...people dead.

619
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:34,120
Crashed and bled out, dead.

620
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:36,170
Less than 1 percent immunity.

621
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:40,130
That left 12 million healthy people like you, me and Ethan.

622
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:44,430
The other 588 million...

623
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:46,640
...turned into your Darkseekers.

624
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,470
And then they got hungry.

625
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:53,060
And they killed and fed on everybody.

626
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:56,310
Everybody!

627
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:01,990
Every single person that you or I has ever known...

628
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:04,110
...is dead!

629
01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:08,330
Dead!

630
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:12,410
There is no God. There is no God.

631
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:19,550
What is that?

632
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,220
Was it still dark when you brought us home last night?

633
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:29,470
You were bleeding. There was light on the horizon.

634
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,810
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

635
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,480
They followed us home.

636
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:44,320
Ethan.

637
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:32,230
Shit.

638
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,550
Anna.

639
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:49,890
Anna.

640
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,270
Anna!

641
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,820
Anna!

642
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,830
Anna!

643
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,890
Anna?

644
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:08,610
Anna.

645
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,670
Come on. Come on.

646
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,670
-Are you okay? You all right?    -Yeah.

647
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,380
Are you all right?

648
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:16,130
-You okay?    -Oh, my God. You're bleeding.

649
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:32,430
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

650
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:35,440
Get to the lab! To the lab!

651
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:45,830
Get behind the Plexi.

652
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,330
Oh, my God. Come on.

653
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:02,680
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

654
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:06,270
Oh, my God.

655
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,740
It's working.

656
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,450
Neville...

657
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,540
...it's working.

658
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:36,670
No! Stop! Stop!

659
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:40,260
Look, look, look, I can save you.

660
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:43,890
I can sa... I can help you. You are sick and I can help you.

661
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:48,980
I can... I can fix this!

662
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:50,690
I can save everybody!

663
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:54,060
I can fix everything! It's working. It's working!

664
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,740
Stop! Stop!

665
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:08,330
Let me save you! Let me save you!

666
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,540
No, no!

667
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,630
No, no!

668
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:40,780
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

669
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,510
Robert.

670
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:11,970
-What are you doing?    -The cure is in her blood.

671
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,570
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe. Ethan, get in!

672
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,320
-Go.    -Come on, get in.

673
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,360
-Get in.    -Anna.

674
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:28,450
I think this is why you're here.

675
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,250
What are you doing?

676
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:35,460
I'm listening.

677
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,920
-Neville, there's room. Come!    -No.

678
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:41,050
They're not gonna stop. They're not gonna stop.

679
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:45,340
Stay in till dawn.

680
01:31:03,810 --> 01:31:08,570
In 2009, a deadly virus burned through our civilization...

681
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,990
...pushing humankind to the edge of extinction.

682
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:15,120
Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life...

683
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:17,620
...to the discovery of a cure...

684
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:20,540
...and the restoration of humanity.

685
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:23,830
On September 9th, 2012...

686
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:26,920
...at approximately 8:49 p.m...

687
01:31:27,090 --> 01:31:29,040
...he discovered that cure.

688
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:35,470
And at 8:52, he gave his life to defend it.

689
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,020
We are his legacy.

690
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:42,560
This is his legend.

691
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:46,730
Light up the darkness.
