11
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:03,240
My name is Barry Allen,

12
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,380
and I am the fastest man alive.

13
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,060
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

19
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,640
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

20
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,470
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

22
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,700
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,

23
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,110
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

25
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,430
and I saw him murder the woman that I love.

26
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,190
But I won't let that happen.

28
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm gonna do everything in my power

29
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,170
to change the future,

30
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,560
and I'm the only one fast enough

32
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,780
to keep her alive.

33
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,060
I am The Flash.

34
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,930
Previously on "The Flash."

35
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm free!

36
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,420
Who are you?

37
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,040
I am the future Flash.

38
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,650
I can't spend the rest of my life

39
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,690
wondering if I'm gonna become Killer Frost.

40
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,710
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.

41
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,760
You just want your own meta-human specialist

42
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,840
to try and find you a cure.

43
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,980
That's not the only reason.

44
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,170
I wish I could believe that.

45
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm Cisco, by the way. You must be Gypsy.

46
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,750
You're into me.

47
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,980
Even if I was, you couldn't handle me.

48
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,950
I'll marry that woman.

49
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,600
Iris West, will you marry me?

50
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,570
Yes.

54
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,190
Looks like we may need to find a new job.

55
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,040
Heard Stagg Industries may be getting bought out.

56
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,260
By who?

57
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,250
Doesn't really matter now, does it?

58
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,630
All I know is we got millions of dollars of tech--

59
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,640
like whatever that thing is--

60
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,220
that no one's using.

61
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,500
Then surely you gentlemen won't mind

62
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,090
if I abscond with some of it.

63
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,100
This piece in particular.

64
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,220
How did you get in here?

65
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,290
Believe me, that's the least impressive of my tricks.

66
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,130
Hands up, pal. Do it now, or I'll shoot.

67
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,260
Stop!

68
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,840
How the hell did he do that?

69
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,400
Maybe you can figure out how I did it,

70
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,920
but... I doubt you'll have time.

73
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,190
It's just beautiful.

74
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,410
You know what, it matches the sparkle in your eyes.

75
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,850
- Thank you. - Barry,

76
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,250
your grandfather had really good taste in jewelry.

77
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,560
Yeah, he did.

78
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,510
Okay, so, break it down. How did it happen?

79
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,920
We were at the apartment,

80
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,090
and, Barry sang to me.

81
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,780
And then he proposed.

82
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,030
Oh, my God, that's so romantic.

83
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,910
You sing?

84
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,470
Not as good as Joe.

85
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,040
Shut up, Barry.

86
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,020
Well, okay, that reminds me,

87
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,190
my sister has four tickets that she can't use...

88
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,520
- to "Hamilton." - "Hamilton"?

89
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,400
On the house.

90
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,000
I thought that maybe we could make it a double

91
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,100
if you guys were interested?

92
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,040
Uh, yeah, we're interested. When?

93
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,310
First weekend in July.

94
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,030
Um, July.

95
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,970
Y-- does that not work for you guys?

96
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,180
No, that works great.

97
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,990
We'll be there, all of us.

98
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,320
Don't! Don't do this!

99
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,160
Please? I'm begging you! Just--

100
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,050
Barry!

101
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,240
You lose, Barry.

102
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,580
No!

103
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,210
Well, everything's the same.

104
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,370
The future has not changed.

105
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,650
All right. Well, we have two months

106
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,890
to make sure that it does.

107
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,990
Okay, well, we should approach this

108
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,840
the same way we approach any other problem--

109
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,170
start with what we know.

110
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,350
Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.

111
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,670
Therein lies the rub.

112
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,280
I feel like we can't understand any of this

113
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,970
until it actually happens.

114
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,550
It's like Savitar's prophecies.

115
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,920
Precisely, and just like the newspaper headlines.

117
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,660
Well, all bar one.

118
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,100
It's a crime scene. We gotta go.

119
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,150
- Stagg Industries? - All right, no.

120
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,450
Hey, Julian, before you go,

121
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,290
there was an envelope delivered for you

122
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,100
from the Central City Opera.

123
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,180
Yes, you'd mentioned that you'd never gone before, so--

124
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,430
well, I got them for us a while back, but now--

125
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,950
just go with whoever you'd like.

126
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,870
Looks like things between you and Julian

127
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,150
are a little frosty, huh?

128
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,430
It's too soon for the cold puns?

129
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,160
- Yeah. - Yeah. Thought so.

130
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,150
He still doesn't trust me after I lied

131
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,460
about taking a piece of the Philosopher's Stone.

132
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,090
You did what you felt you needed to do

133
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,100
to get rid of your powers.

134
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,580
I know that and you know that, but he--

135
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,020
He'll come around. Watch.

136
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,710
I don't know that he will, Cisco.

137
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,790
Hey, Bar. Anything?

138
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,920
Nothing yet.

139
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
How the hell did this thing get filled with water

140
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,630
and those poor dudes get trapped in here?

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,790
Beats me.

142
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,190
There's no water access in the entire wing.

143
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,670
Instead of sprinklers,

144
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,330
every floor uses a halon gas system

145
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,330
that absorbs all the oxygen if there's a fire.

146
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,710
What about the security cams?

147
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,180
None of them either.

148
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,450
Apparently, the Stagg geniuses

149
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,430
don't want any of their "Secrets" to get out.

150
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,110
Julian, please tell me you found something.

151
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,340
Nothing yet, Detective.

152
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,520
No fingerprints, no DNA,

153
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,500
just two rather plump looking corpses.

154
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,130
What about the stolen tech?

155
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,300
Nothing. No one's saying a thing.

156
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,420
Everyone is incredibly tight-lipped about it.

157
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,810
Of course they are. Look, I'll make some phone calls,

158
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,700
see if I can pry those lips open, all right?

159
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,410
Okay. I'll keep working on it.

160
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,470
This is the last thing we need to be dealing with right now.

161
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,090
I feel the same way, but we can't just do nothing.

162
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,910
Iris ain't gonna let us get away with that.

163
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,250
I know, Joe, but we're running out of time.

164
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,800
That's why you and me need to solve this case fast.

165
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,800
Yeah.

166
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,180
Sometimes...I wish you hadn't told me what was gonna happen.

167
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,060
Yeah, I know.

168
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,700
Hold on.

169
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,580
What's up.

170
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,120
Looks like we got a robbery in progress over at Kord Industries.

171
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,580
Great, thanks. Now Kord Industries.

172
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,790
That's two in one day.

173
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,300
That's two in under 12 hours.

174
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,900
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure it's the last one.

175
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,850
I don't think that's yours, pal.

176
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,050
Flash.

177
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,350
You didn't think I'd want to come meet

178
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,600
the newest resident of Iron Heights?

179
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,400
No, I assumed that you'd show.

180
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,120
I just didn't expect you to be so young,

181
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,370
Barry...Allen.

182
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,680
Now, how do you know who I am?

183
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm from the future.

184
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,870
You don't believe me? Let's see, uh, 2017.

185
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,900
How are things going with your doomed love,

186
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,420
Iris West?

187
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,510
Or your greatest foe, Savitar?

188
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,290
You know Savitar.

189
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:00,740
I know everything about him, and you.

190
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,830
What the--

191
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,020
Gypsy.

192
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,110
Still seeking revenge, I see.

193
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm gonna get it this time.

194
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,910
We'll see.

195
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,430
No!

197
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,600
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.

198
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,280
As in hocus pocus?

199
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,050
He's certainly got a lot of tricks.

200
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,680
Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology

201
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,760
built into his body--

202
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,270
allows him to do some extraordinary feats.

203
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,850
Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it,

204
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,500
and believe me, I have seen it all.

205
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,960
So that card trick he played on Barry,

206
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,750
the water tank at Stagg,

207
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,510
that's all some futuristic tech that he's masking as magic?

208
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,650
Well, it's Arthur C. Clarke's third law.

209
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,800
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is...

210
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,860
indistinguishable from magic."

211
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,420
Before you showed up, he said he was from the future.

212
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,640
The future?

213
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,920
He is, 64th Century.

214
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Great, another criminal from the future.

215
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,940
Haven't we had our fill of those guys?

216
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,770
64th Century.

217
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,860
What exactly are you after him for?

218
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,120
He's at the top of the collectors' most wanted list.

219
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,190
Showed up on my Earth a few years back,

220
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,750
did a string of robberies that ended with a lot of people losing their lives.

221
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,120
Showed up again a couple weeks ago,

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
looted some tech companies, came here.

223
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,300
To do the same thing? Why?

224
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,030
He must have needed our Earth's tech for something.

225
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,740
Well, whatever it is, we can definitely help you

226
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,620
figure it out, 'cause I don't know about you guys,

227
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,080
but ever since last time you were here,

228
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,420
I've been looking forward to some Gypsy vibe action.

229
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,780
- That's way too much. - Embarrassing.

230
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,830
Yeah, I just want to catch him so I can bring his ass

231
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,940
back to Earth-19 and put him down.

232
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,050
Don't worry. We can help you do that.

233
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,900
We should check and see if Julian's gotten anything.

234
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,980
I'll go ask him.

235
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,760
In the meantime, we can figure out

236
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,520
where this guy disappeared off to.

237
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,460
- Lend me a hand? - Stupid.

238
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,910
I know that look.

239
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,390
What is going on inside that head of yours?

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,020
This guy knew

241
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,460
what was going on with you and me

242
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,530
and Savitar.

243
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,320
If he knows something about Savitar, then--

244
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,120
He might be the key to saving you.

245
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,740
This is the first real lead we've gotten.

246
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,040
But, guys, what about Gypsy?

247
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,080
I mean, if she gets ahold of him,

248
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,840
she's gonna take him back to Earth-19.

249
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,670
We can figure that out later.

250
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,150
Right now, we just need to find him.

251
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,020
I got nothing.

252
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,350
Why can't I find you?

253
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,600
I told you, this guy is smart.

254
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,010
You can't just vibe Kadabra's location.

255
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,810
Whatever he's doing, it renders him invisible to us.

256
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,470
Okay, well, if we can't vibe him,

257
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,590
then I guess we'll have to find him another way, right?

258
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,900
What are you doing?

259
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,010
I'm putting some search parameters

260
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,440
into the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

261
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,730
to see if anybody vibrates at a different frequency

262
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,280
than Earth-1 folk.

263
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,420
Wish we had a satellite that could do that on my Earth.

264
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,250
Wish I had a bunch of this stuff.

265
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,970
I could hook you up, girl.

266
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,670
How about this, I spend a few days on Earth-19,

267
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,650
and set you up with something state-of-the-art.

268
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,180
You know, the only thing is,

269
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,050
I would need a place to crash, so.

270
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,550
- Cisco-- - Gypsy.

271
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,350
That kiss, that wasn't

272
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,250
"I'll see you around".

273
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,590
That was like, "That needs to happen again, real soon".

274
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,900
Or did I misread that?

275
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,830
I-I-I've been preoccupied.

276
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,740
Is that the only reason?

277
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,400
Great timing!

279
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,720
Looks like David Copperfield's not too far from us.

280
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,860
He's at one of Mercury Labs' satellite offices.

281
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,980
Another tech company?

282
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,230
The techiest.

283
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,020
Let's grab the speedsters and go.

284
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,780
Man, you just can't help yourself, can you?

285
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,920
You brought the whole team this time.

286
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,350
That wasn't very smart, was it?

287
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,290
Oh, this guy sucks.

288
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,440
I can see why you want to bring him down so badly.

289
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,410
Do yourself a favor, give it up.

290
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,990
There's nowhere for you to go.

291
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,490
You can't out-trick all of us, Kadabra.

292
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,140
I think I just did.

293
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,830
He's a hologram.

294
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,400
Upon further inspection,

295
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,800
there was some rather odd particulate residue

296
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,370
found at Stagg Industries.

297
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,350
Yeah, that's the nanotechnology that Gypsy was talking about.

298
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,640
But what's it made out of?

299
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,890
Not exactly sure.

300
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,920
It's definitely organic, but it seems to have

301
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,210
some sort of metallic hydrogen properties.

302
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,460
Frankly, it's--

303
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,570
Beyond your understanding.

304
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,460
You make a move, you'll regret it.

305
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,260
Do you know how many times I've heard that, Detective?

306
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,330
Told you.

307
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,140
Damn it.

308
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,620
Go, go, go!

309
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,560
Guys, move to the side.

310
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,750
Now...I can get what I came for.

311
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,570
Everybody okay?

312
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,160
Magic or tech, doesn't matter. You're not getting out of these.

313
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,080
Maybe not.

314
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,240
You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.

315
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,950
It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.

316
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,530
What secret?

317
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,060
I know who he is.

318
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,050
I know his name.

319
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Hand him over!

320
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,610
Why'd you lock him up?

321
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,310
I'm taking him right back to my Earth.

322
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,370
Okay, but I need to talk to him first.

323
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,490
Fine. Get what you need from him,

324
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,450
but when you're done, he's mine.

325
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,950
You are gonna die for all the things you've done.

326
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,900
I cannot wait to see you be put to death.

327
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,970
Uh, I'm gonna talk to her.

328
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,370
Gypsy, darling?

329
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,770
You said you know who Savitar is.

330
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,850
I know everything about the God of Speed,

331
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,640
hallowed be his name.

333
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,870
Like what?

334
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,740
That he's unstoppable,

335
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,080
that he was the first speedster,

336
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,270
and that you defeat him,

337
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,420
but not until after he takes what matters the most to you--

338
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,560
Iris West.

339
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,490
Tell us who he is, now!

340
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,650
I don't think so.

341
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,210
It's frustrating, isn't it,

342
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,550
knowing that you're going to die

343
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,960
unless I give The Flash what he wants.

344
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,730
All that power, all that speed,

345
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,320
and yet you're still too slow.

346
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,590
This isn't a game or a trick.

347
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,390
This is about my daughter's life.

348
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,120
And it's my life

349
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,790
if you hand me over to that collector.

350
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,650
It's simple.

351
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,660
Let me out, and I'll tell you who Savitar is.

352
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,630
Give me to Gypsy, and Iris dies.

353
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,860
The decision lies with you, Barry.

354
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Guys, we can't let Gypsy take him

355
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,750
before we find out who Savitar is.

356
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,130
No, we cannot.

357
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,510
Then what are we supposed to do?

358
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,120
I don't know.

359
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,940
What is it with you and this guy?

360
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,180
It's like you're hell-bent on taking him back with you.

361
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,510
He killed a lot of people on Earth-19.

362
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,290
He's killed people here too.

363
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,750
No one you know or care about.

364
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,910
Did he take somebody from you?

365
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,130
Is that what this is about?

366
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,150
What this is about, Cisco,

367
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,980
is he needs to be brought to justice,

368
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,180
and I am not gonna let anything or anyone

369
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,620
prevent me from doing that.

371
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,420
You're lucky.

372
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,000
This could've been a lot worse.

373
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,130
I'm fine, really.

374
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,070
It's merely a flesh wound,

375
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,150
as the "Monty Python" Boys would say.

376
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,510
Anyway, thanks for patching me up.

377
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
Of course.

378
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,330
Listen, I've been trying to find

379
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,400
the right time to say this, and...

380
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,850
now seems to be as good a time as any.

381
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,740
I was so focused on not hurting you

382
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,770
as Killer Frost

383
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,270
that I forgot that I could hurt you as Caitlin Snow,

384
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,970
and for that I'm very sorry.

385
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,310
So I understand if you don't trust me anymore,

386
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,870
but... maybe you can find it in your heart to forgive me?

387
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,110
You're good to go.

388
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,190
Thank you.

389
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,010
We're gonna figure this out, Barry.

390
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,020
A guy like Kadabra,

391
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,400
he should have no say whether you live or die.

392
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,980
How do you even know that he's telling the truth?

393
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,660
I mean, he's done nothing but tricks since he got here.

394
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,680
I mean, maybe--maybe this is one of them.

395
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,940
It's not, Iris.

396
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,740
So...what, you want to let him go?

397
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,700
I mean, it just feels like our only move.

398
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,050
He's a murderer.

399
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,480
I know he's a murderer,

400
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,310
but I mean, how many murderers we put in prison?

401
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,440
How many bad guys have we taken down?

402
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,870
I mean, don't we deserve one win

403
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,250
after everything that we've done?

404
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,720
Life doesn't keep score, Barry.

405
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,560
You should know that better than anyone.

406
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,920
Look, even if Kadabra hadn't showed up,

407
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,390
we'd still be in the same place we are right now.

408
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,930
But he did, and if he knows

409
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,620
who Savitar is, he's gonna tell us.

410
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,820
- Barry-- - Iris, he can save your life.

411
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,320
No, you can save my life.

412
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,370
Not him.

413
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,460
Trust me,

414
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,440
I want to find out who Savitar is just as badly as you do.

415
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,250
But I don't want to let someone who has caused so much pain

416
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,610
walk free just to save my life.

417
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,210
You know, deep down,

418
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,830
I don't think you want that either.

419
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,370
I knew you'd come.

420
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,670
'Cause you're the only person who's willing to do... anything.

421
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,040
What do you want?

422
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,220
To be set free.

423
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,960
Murdering people, stealing smart tech.

424
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,530
You came here for something.

425
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,810
Told you before, Detective,

426
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,890
it is beyond your understanding.

427
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,560
This is about my daughter's life.

428
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,980
It's as simple as that for me.

429
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,500
You tell me who Savitar is,

430
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,470
and I will let you go.

431
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,270
You don't, you're going with Gypsy.

432
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,260
A leap of faith for us both then.

433
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,310
Open the door.

434
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,880
If you take one step before you tell me,

435
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,480
I will blow you away. Understood?

436
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,530
But you do not know this guy.

438
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,590
Great timing!

439
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,640
What is that?

440
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,770
No.

441
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,680
Gypsy!

442
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,850
Give me the name.

443
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,070
The name, now!

444
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,610
Savitar... is--

445
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,990
No! What the hell are you doing?

446
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,300
He was about to tell me who Savitar is!

447
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,270
Damn it!

448
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,270
Kadabra's on the loose! He's somewhere in the building!

449
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,330
And there we are.

450
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,690
Thank you, Doctor Wells.

451
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,430
Joe, he's headed for the elevator!

453
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,300
We had a deal.

454
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,660
Your freedom for Savitar's identity.

455
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,170
I've altered the terms of our agreement.

456
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,710
It appears that you have as well.

457
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,000
Move!

458
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,890
Caitlin! Caitlin, are you all right?

459
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,960
- You all right? - Yeah.

460
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,720
- Come on. - I'm okay. Okay, I'm okay.

461
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,460
Okay, okay, easy. Okay, easy.

462
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,630
- Come on. - Gentle, gentle.

463
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,990
Yeah, yeah, yup.

464
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,390
The-- the-- hand me the x-ray machine,

465
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,130
- grab it for us, would you, please? - Yup.

466
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,420
Here, here.

467
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,180
Okay, good. Remove it.

468
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,260
How bad is it?

469
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,400
Uh, it's bad.

470
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,510
It's bad, there's quite a few pieces of shrapnel inside you,

471
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,310
and they look deep enough to pierce your kidney

472
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,930
if they're not removed immediately.

473
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,600
Guys, we have to get her to a hospital.

474
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,160
We can't, they're gonna ID her as a meta.

475
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,220
And not just any meta.

476
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,780
Yeah, one that we have a file on for attacking CCPD.

477
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,490
Then what are we going to do? None of us are doctors

478
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,470
and she can't operate on herself.

479
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,200
We do have another option.

480
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,280
What is it?

481
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,190
When Caitlin goes meta, her metabolic rate

482
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,850
offsets cold tissue destruction.

483
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,890
She can regenerate?

484
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,870
No, we're not gonna take off my necklace.

485
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,190
I don't need a hospital.

486
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,800
All I need is a mirror and a steady set of hands.

487
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,870
You were a field medic in the Royal Army, right?

488
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,560
What? No, I-I-I've never operated on anyone before.

489
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,860
That's okay, I'll walk you through it.

490
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,570
Caitlin, you're talking about staying awake

491
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,480
during your own surgery.

492
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,150
I'm putting my life in your hands.

493
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,580
I trust you, Julian.

494
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,280
What the hell were you thinking?

495
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,180
Now is not the time, Gypsy.

496
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,420
You know, you got a really messed up sense of justice for a cop?

497
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,880
Watch yourself.

498
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,580
I took two oaths in my life.

499
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,610
One, to uphold the law. The other, to protect my family.

500
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,080
Guess which one takes priority?

501
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,660
That was my prisoner.

502
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,740
He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.

503
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,590
He has information that could save Iris's life,

504
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,350
so I don't give a damn!

505
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,060
It's because of you he's on the loose.

506
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,440
Because of me? No, no, because of you.

507
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,630
You opened that door! You let him out!

508
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:10,940
That is on you, Detective!

509
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,100
How much of that did you hear?

510
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,730
I heard enough.

511
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,060
This is my friend.

512
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,620
It's the man's daughter.

513
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,180
I mean, wouldn't you do that for someone you cared about?

514
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,770
I am doing that, you idiot!

515
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,330
Okay, what does that mean?

516
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,290
For who? Who are you talking about?

517
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,200
I used to have a partner.

518
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,270
Like, a "Partne" or...like a partner?

519
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,540
Both.

520
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,130
It was a long time ago, Cisco.

521
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,270
It's not like I'm burning a candle for the guy, but

522
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,230
he did mean something to me.

523
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,200
It's been three years since Abra Kadabra shot him dead.

524
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,770
I'm sorry.

525
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,430
I have been searching for him ever since,

526
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,390
and he finally showed back up.

527
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,410
Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights,

528
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,250
and then your friend messed it all up.

529
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,100
So yes, I do know what it is like

530
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,190
to care about someone so much that you break the rules.

531
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,130
That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what,

532
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,660
and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.

533
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,630
No more delays.

534
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,560
- Ready? - Ready as I'll ever be.

535
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,890
Okay, let's starst with the shrapnel on the surface.

536
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,360
Okey-dokey.

537
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,470
Just let me know if I do any

538
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,780
...thing wrong, okay?

539
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,960
Okay, that's the first bit. Well done.

540
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,200
Okay.

541
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,070
Is there supposed to be this much blood?

542
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:47,330
It's normal for the shrapnel to cavitate

543
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,540
and displace tissue, but if I lose too much blood,

544
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,960
I'll start hemorrhaging.

545
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,050
Okay.

546
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,010
Oh, my God. Okay.

547
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,990
All right, nearly done, nearly done,

548
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,490
hang in there, hang in there.

549
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,330
Okay, well done. Well done, that's all the pieces

550
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,130
of shrapnel from the surface gone.

551
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,920
Okay, great. Now it's time for the hard one.

552
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,800
But you're doing great.

553
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,900
- You got this, okay, Julian? - Yes.

554
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,060
It's wedged between my kidney and my inferior vena cava,

555
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,340
and it's surrounded by some major blood vessels.

556
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,750
If you hit them, there's a good chance

557
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,910
- I'll go into shock. - Shock?

558
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,830
But it's okay. You've got this.

559
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,360
Okay. All right.

560
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,490
Heart rate's increasing.

561
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,560
Okay, I think I've got it.

562
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,850
Great, pull it out.

563
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,230
I can't, Caitlin, it's stuck.

564
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,540
Then turn it.

565
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,430
Guys, it's getting up there.

566
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,590
It might be a tendon in the way.

567
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,840
If it's not a tendon--

568
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,740
Then I will rip this necklace off.

569
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,060
No! I would rather die.

570
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,290
Caitlin, this is going to hurt.

571
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,820
Can you please stitch me up,

572
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,790
because I think I need to pass out?

573
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,470
Yes, yes. Of course, of course.

574
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,690
Well done, well done.

575
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,250
She's gonna be all right.

576
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,660
Thank God.

577
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,180
That really was amazing, Julian.

578
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,830
Seriously. Julian Albert, MD.

579
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,810
Hey, I think I know why Abra Kadabra's been

580
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,680
- stealing all that tech. - Why?

581
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,990
Build a time machine.

582
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,350
He's trying to get back to the future.

583
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,860
Presto.

584
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,510
What is that thing in his hands?

585
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,390
Everything Kadabra's been stealing,

586
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,190
these are the exact components I used to build

587
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,790
Evil Wells's time sphere two years ago,

588
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,100
but I could never figure out what he used for a power source.

589
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,340
I think this is it.

590
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,910
So that's what he took from the time vault,

591
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,070
its power source?

592
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,210
Last thing he needs to return to the 64th century.

593
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,430
Well, we need to find his ass

594
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,840
before he pulls another disappearing act.

595
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,760
If Kadabra's plan is to "Marty McFly" himself

596
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,850
back to the future--

597
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,940
He's gonna have to open a temporal wormhole first,

598
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,720
- and when he does-- - We can nail him.

599
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,870
No, he's mine.

600
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,470
I look forward to showing him the same mercy

601
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,680
he showed my partner.

602
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,960
Hey, Gypsy.

603
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
You can't go after him alone.

604
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,390
Sure I can.

605
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,360
You want justice for all those people that he's hurt,

606
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,010
for your partner, right?

607
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,240
Right now we're trying to prevent someone we love

608
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,580
from getting hurt, but we can't do that without your help.

609
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,430
I don't trust you guys anymore.

610
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,100
Kadabra's already given both of us the slip.

611
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,710
He does it again through time,

612
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,610
I don't think we get this opportunity back.

613
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,900
Only way we catch him is together.

615
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,210
Guys, Abra Kadabra's heading south on Ninth.

616
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,580
He opened up a wormhole.

617
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,920
What do you say?

618
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,690
We can't let him get past this.

619
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,170
We're not gonna do that.

620
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,660
Catch me if you can.

621
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,330
Where's he at?

622
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,150
He's on State and Main!

623
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,420
We're on it!

624
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,630
You shall not pass!

625
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,360
Okay, now he's on Thurlow and Eighth.

627
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:58,390
- We're gonna lose him. - No, we're not.

628
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,570
He's on Seventh, and he's moving fast!

629
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,270
You gotta stop this guy.

631
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,860
Time to go home.

632
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,150
Bar, he opened up another wormhole!

633
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,080
Yes! He did it, he got him.

634
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,530
Thank God.

635
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,230
So much for your disappearing act.

636
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,290
No!

637
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,500
By the laws of Earth-19, I hereby collect you

638
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,030
for the crime of mass murder.

639
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,710
Let her take me.

640
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,210
You'll never find out what I know.

641
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,590
And Iris dies.

642
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
You've come to see me off.

643
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,360
Really touched.

644
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,520
What are we gonna do here?

645
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,790
You're going with her.

646
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,680
I'm not gonna stop her.

647
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,760
Then you'll never find out what you want to know.

648
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,280
I have nothing to offer you.

649
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,060
No reprieve.

650
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,710
No escape for what you're facing.

651
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,460
You've done some terrible things.

652
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,900
But you are still a man.

653
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,370
You have a family,

654
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,490
friends, people that you care about.

655
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,910
Somewhere inside of you there must be

656
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:49,250
a glimmer of light, of hope.

657
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,260
It's that part of you that I'm asking.

658
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:55,870
I'm begging.

659
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,800
Help me save her.

660
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,630
Flash.

661
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,160
Begging.

662
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,200
See, here it is.

663
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,070
In the future, you and I have been enemies for years.

664
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,470
Oh, there have been others, of course.

665
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,680
There was Thawne, Zoom, DeVoe,

666
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,610
but none of them hurt you like Savitar.

667
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,880
He truly broke you.

668
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,640
I have to be honest.

669
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,050
I was always a little bit jealous.

670
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,910
But now, it's like I get to kill her too.

671
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,770
If you'll excuse me, I have my execution to attend.

672
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,930
Where does this leave us?

673
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,380
I don't know.

674
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,060
Cisco, I--

675
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,890
I'm still here.

676
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,730
Yeah.

677
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,700
Wasn't gonna let you go that easy.

678
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,190
Kadabra?

679
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,630
He's gone.

680
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,780
He's gone for good, apparently.

681
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:06,380
Sorry. My palm's are sweaty.

682
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,030
It's quite all right.

683
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,800
Honestly, my stitch work may leave

684
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
quite a lot to be desired, so.

685
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,810
It's okay.

686
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,690
I was never much of a two-piece bathing suit

687
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,310
kind of gal anyway.

688
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,080
I cannot believe what you did, Caitlin.

689
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,340
I mean, staying awake during your own surgery,

690
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,750
that's one thing, but talking my clumsy hands

691
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,470
through it, that's quite the other.

692
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,120
You are immensely brave.

693
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,970
You fought through the pain

694
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,980
like I've never seen anyone before.

695
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,070
You did all the hard work.

696
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,790
Hardly.

697
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,770
You going soft on me, Julian?

698
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,580
Yes.

699
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,540
Absolutely.

700
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,620
I'm so terribly sorry.

701
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,690
That's most clumsy of me.

702
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,870
Some bedside manner you got there.

703
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,100
I'm working on it.

704
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,120
Just rest.

705
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,990
Here you go.

706
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,290
Thank you.

707
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,970
Easy.

708
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,540
Sorry.

709
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,240
I should've been stronger.

710
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,260
You think you should've shot Kadabra?

711
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:44,270
Dad, I think you showed true strength by letting him go.

712
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,910
I try to be strong for you guys,

713
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,590
for you and Wally and Barry.

714
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,180
Dad, you have been,

715
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,820
and it makes me stronger too.

716
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,940
When you were a baby, I was--

717
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,960
I was terrified

718
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,780
that you might die in the middle of the night.

719
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,640
I just didn't sleep.

720
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,260
I would just...

721
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,090
sit in your room...

722
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,960
and watch you sleep.

723
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,600
I put my hand on your chest,

724
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,500
just to make sure you were breathing, and then I--

725
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,670
I would just sit there there, praying that...

726
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,320
you'd just keep breathing.

727
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,440
That's how I feel right now.

728
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,840
I don't know what I can do to save you.

729
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,870
I know how to save her.

730
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,550
What?

731
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,400
I know how to save her.

732
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,910
Kadabra, Savitar, Thawne.

733
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,560
You know, they're always one step ahead of us...

734
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,210
for one reason--

735
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,350
they know what's gonna happen.

736
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,270
So every move we make,

737
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,260
every trap we try and set,

738
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,210
it's all just history to them.

739
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,920
They're armed with the future.

740
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,850
Well, not anymore.

741
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,490
What does that mean?

742
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,830
If the answers that we need to stop Savitar and save you

743
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,050
are in the future, then that's where I need to go.

744
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,470
I'm gonna run to the future.

745
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,280
No more strawberry.

746
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,740
What do you mean, there's no more strawberry?

747
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,560
I just bought some, like, a week ago.

748
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:42,290
Yeah, well, I may have eaten some,

749
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,130
slash--all.

750
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,710
- Cisco. - Do you want me to go out

751
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,710
and get you more strawberry Jell-O?

752
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,820
I will get you more.

753
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,960
No, it's fine,

754
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,860
but next time I operate on you, you're getting bupkes, mister.

755
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,290
Mm, next time you operate on me,

756
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,220
maybe you can... fix my broken heart.

757
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,730
I'm sorry it didn't work out with you and Gypsy.

758
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,460
If two meta-humans from two different universes

759
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,860
with the same vibrational powers

760
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,030
can't make it work, then what hope is there?

761
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,010
There you guys are.

762
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,110
I've been looking all over for--

763
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,850
what are you doing in bed?

764
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,370
It's a long story, H.R.

765
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,240
I have a long story.

766
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,660
Yeah, how about you tell us where you've been?

767
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,900
Her name is Rhonda, and she's into new positions.

768
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,060
- We had the-- - Okay. Oh, my God.

769
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,470
Stop talking. You gotta let somebody know

770
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,880
next time you decide to go on a two-day love romp.

771
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,480
Who was worried about me? He was.

772
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,590
I'm touched.

773
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,310
You'll be touched in the face with a hammer

774
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,540
the next time you pull something like that.

775
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,720
Guys, stop it.

776
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,940
Don't make me laugh, or I'll bust my stitches.

777
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,780
Is that lime Jell-O?

778
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,370
It's all you, H.R.

779
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,200
Are you serious?

780
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,720
I... love the lime.

781
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,600
I love the lime!

782
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,630
You were really worried about him, weren't you?

783
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,130
Just promise me that you'll never ever tell him.

784
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,160
Cross my heart and hope to--

785
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,100
Caitlin?

786
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,560
Caitlin? Caitlin? Somebody help!

787
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,690
What happened? What happened?

788
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,980
I don't know, she just started seizing.

789
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,240
Hold her down, hold her down.

790
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,020
Hey, H.R., grab her legs. Hold her down!

791
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,750
What--what's happening?

792
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,610
- She's not breathing. - We have to get an ambulance

793
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,900
- in here right now. - H.R., grab the crash cart.

794
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,340
Cisco, grab the oxygen.

795
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,100
Wheel it over here!

796
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,050
Slow and steady, over her mouth.

797
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,190
Okay, good.

798
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,590
Come on, slow and steady, that's it.That's it.

799
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,790
What's happening?

800
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,120
She may have threw a blood clot, I don't know.

801
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,560
- Julian! - Charge the paddles!

802
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,500
- Okay-- - Give me the paddles!

803
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,270
Charging, you're good.

804
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,410
Okay, give me the-- give it here. Clear.

805
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:50,080
All the way, turn it up to the top!

806
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,880
- All the way up! - Okay, you're ready.

807
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,770
- Clear. - Clear, clear, clear.

808
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,740
Char--go.

809
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:00,750
She's gotta--

810
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,920
Come on, Caitlin, come on!

811
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,770
Keep going, just keep going.

812
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,260
Uh, here, take this.

813
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,230
Here we go, she's coming back.

814
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,640
She's coming back.

815
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,240
Yes, she is.

816
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,230
Come on. Here she comes.

817
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,820
Come on! Don't stop.

818
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,090
Please.

819
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,030
Please don't stop.

820
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,150
She's gone.

821
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,530
Stop! That's not what she wanted!

822
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:57,680
I don't care!

823
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,130
I'm not gonna sit here and watch her die, okay?

824
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:03,820
Okay?

825
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,430
It's all right, mate, it's okay.

826
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,470
It's okay.

827
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,970
Caitlin?

828
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,020
Caitlin?
