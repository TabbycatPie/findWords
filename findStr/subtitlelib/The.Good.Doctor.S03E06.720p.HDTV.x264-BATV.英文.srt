20
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,070
Sorry, Dr. Andrews.

21
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:11,400
I had a patient with some post-op arm pain.

22
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,480
How can I help you?

23
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,780
What's happened to all the nurses?

24
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,380
Hello.

25
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,340
My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy,

26
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,520
surgical resident year 3.

27
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,430
I will be assisted by Dr. Claire Browne

28
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,890
on today's open appendectomy.

29
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,300
I will not be putting on my number 7 sterile gloves myself,

30
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,140
as I am lead surgeon.

31
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,070
Nurse Fletch, can you adjust the overhead light?

32
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,880
How many degrees, Dr. Murphy?

33
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,800
Ah, yes. I should be more specific.

34
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
A 35-degree angle.

35
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,400
Nurse Hawks, please hand me the 10 blade.

36
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,270
Straight clamp, please, Nurse Fletch.

37
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,320
Hello, Dr. Andrews.

38
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,290
I'm going to try to pretend you're not here.

39
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,450
You have not pretended to scrub in

40
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,480
and may not be here when here is there,

41
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,470
there being O.R. 2 later today.

42
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,280
You don't need a full surgical team to rehearse.

43
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,840
Some of this staff needs to get back to their stations.

44
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,130
No. They can stay here.

45
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,600
Chief Lim has assigned me my second first surgery,

46
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,220
and she assigned them all to me

47
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,320
and told me to rehearse with all of them

48
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,070
unless and until there's an emergency on their floor.

49
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,170
Dr. Browne, please hand me the Bovie.

50
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,410
Dr. Browne had a dental appointment this morning.

51
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,480
I'm doing my best to be annoyingly caring and empathetic in her stead.

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,950
There's the baby.

54
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,930
And there's the mass.

55
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,270
Way too close together.

56
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,940
A biopsy is out of the question.

57
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,780
Best course is to go in and remove the entire mass.

58
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,330
Will that be dangerous for the baby?

59
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,130
The odds of your daughter being harmed are very low.

60
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,210
And what about recovery time?

61
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,110
How long?

62
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,550
Normal recovery is about three weeks.

63
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,850
We're opening a specialty toy store.

64
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,830
I need to be up and about in a week.

65
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,080
Tell 'em, Andre.

66
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,150
Sustainable natural toys.

67
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,150
Good for the kids, good for the world.

68
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,050
I don't really want to leave Andre to fight the crowds alone.

69
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,230
Well, a week is not realistic.

70
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,140
Too much stress on your body after the surgery

71
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,730
could put the pregnancy at risk.

72
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,820
It's okay.

73
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,550
Andre worries.

74
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,650
Thought it was too much to start a business and a family

75
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,980
all before our first anniversary.

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,060
Business and family are easy.

77
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,390
If I'd known it was business and family and cancer,

78
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,300
I...might have waited on one of them.

79
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,670
Let's just worry about the surgery right now.

80
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,660
Okay?

81
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,730
Dr. Lim.

82
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,350
Just came from Dr. Murphy's improv class.

83
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,110
I don't remember Browne getting a full-team rehearsal

84
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,610
before her first surgery.

85
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,750
Our residents are not homogeneous.

86
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,550
Each one requires different attention and training.

87
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,420
I agree.

88
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,560
And for Shaun, that means less training wheels

89
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,140
and more scabbed knees.

90
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,090
Trust me, his knees will get scabbed.

91
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,700
I'm trying to prevent a decapitation.

92
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,600
If he's not ready --

93
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,350
Why don't you follow your own advice?

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,810
You think this is the wrong option, stop telling me.

95
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,850
Let me fail and learn.

96
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,770
But be sure to apologize when you realize I was right.

97
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,170
The appendix can be removed in various ways,

98
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,020
including suture ligation, purse-stringing,

99
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,610
and inversion appendectomy.

100
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,210
I will be using the suture ligation technique.

101
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,210
Dr. Browne, place a clamp just proximal

102
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,320
to the distal ligature on the appendix.

103
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,120
How's it going with Carly?

104
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,280
Divide sharply and cauterize the exposed mucosa.

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,900
Isn't dating life wonderful?

106
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,680
Everything you hoped it would be?

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,030
Please refrain from asking non-surgical questions, Morgan.

108
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,090
I need to concentrate on the next step

109
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,690
in my O.R. management.

110
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,470
And I need to be Claire.

111
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,440
Is there any chance she's not gonna be concerned

112
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,580
about your personal well-being and inquire?

113
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,700
Repeatedly?

114
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,240
Things are going well, Dr. Browne.

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,040
We make out a lot.

116
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,910
Let's close the peritoneal cavity.

117
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,520
Did you guys have lots of fun on your last day off?

118
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,510
I went to the museum.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,950
Nurse Hawks, please check the patient's vitals.

120
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,500
Everything looks normal.

121
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,280
You went alone?

122
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,490
I called Carly at her house

123
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,270
to see if she wanted to play Chinese checkers.

124
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,510
Close the external oblique fascia

125
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,460
with a continuous 2-0 vicryl stitch.

126
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,100
Although they're not really Chinese.

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,860
It's actually a game of German origin called Sternhalma.

128
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,000
It's very fun.

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,680
I will use 4-0 monocryl subcuticular interrupted sutures

130
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,060
for skin closure.

131
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,570
However, Carly said she could not hang out

132
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,000
because she was busy.

133
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,460
If the wound was contaminated,

134
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,960
we could leave in a Penrose drain

135
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,820
and remove it two to three days later,

136
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,370
but it is not.

137
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,110
She had friends over.

138
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,440
I could hear laughing in the background.

139
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,300
Dr. Browne, approximate all split muscle layers.

140
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,280
That's odd.

141
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,110
Nothing is odd.

142
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,140
We just have two more steps and --

143
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,850
No.

144
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,060
That whatever she was doing, she didn't invite you.

145
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,650
Why?

146
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,040
She isn't treating you like a boyfriend.

147
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,400
You don't exclude your significant other from a get-together.

148
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,760
That's not true. It could have been a family thing.

149
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,370
Or maybe she thinks it's too early to introduce you to her friends.

150
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,290
It's also possible that there was no get-together at all.

151
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,520
I mean, maybe you just heard the television.

152
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,550
Maybe she just doesn't see you as her boyfriend.

153
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,740
Has she ever called you her boyfriend?

154
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,720
We have practiced enough.

155
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,530
You had a dental appointment this morning.

156
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,740
The reason you're late.

157
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,320
So brush extra well and don't forget to floss.

158
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,480
Thanks.

159
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,700
Don't take this the wrong way,

160
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,720
but when did you get so slutty?

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,890
I'm not. Thank you for covering. Now --

162
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,410
This smells like it's been dipped in Drakkar cologne.

163
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,070
Do you really care what I wear or what I do?

164
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,580
I care when you're late.

165
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,290
I care about the amount of extra work I have to do covering for you.

166
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,330
I was an hour late.

167
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,980
How much extra work could that be?

168
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,320
One hour's worth.

169
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,350
So, you can thank me by taking two hours off my hands.

170
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,180
Thank you.

171
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:52,620
Hey, Shaun.

172
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,700
Hello.

173
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,310
Waiting for Carly?

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,340
I want to know why

175
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,750
she did not invite me to her get-together.

176
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,330
Might have a better chance of finding out

177
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,150
if you were physically closer to her.

178
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,240
Maybe later.

179
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,030
This prescription should help him feel a little bit better.

180
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,530
And if I may suggest,

181
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,900
don't store the chocolate laxatives in the candy drawer.

182
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,950
I was wondering if you could get away for lunch.

183
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,390
Yeah. Let me see if I can move some things around.

184
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,450
- Come on in. - Alright.

185
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,810
I got fired.

186
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,590
What?

187
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,560
What happened?

188
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,590
I was giving away free coffee.

189
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,440
We work in a hospital, and I hear a lot of sad stories.

190
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,380
And sometimes when they're really, really sad,

191
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,270
I like to give that person a free coffee,

192
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,600
and it makes them smile.

193
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,080
And yes, okay, I know. It's against policy.

194
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,740
But you'd think my asshat boss

195
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,250
would give me more than two warnings

196
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,760
before giving me the ax.

197
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,410
Okay. What do you want me to do?

198
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,630
You want me to beat him up?

199
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,250
I want you to come home for lunch

200
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,650
and I want to bitch about my ex-boss

201
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,790
and I want someone there to...

202
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,720
listen.

203
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,560
Okay.

204
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,490
Use a tenaculum to grasp the lesion

205
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,960
to create countertraction.

206
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,570
I'm gonna separate the mass from the underlying myometrium.

207
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,800
Damn it. Let's get suction.

208
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,180
The mass has surrounded the uterine arteries.

209
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,430
We can't remove the mass without killing the baby.

210
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,190
Dr. Reznick, if you were lead, how would you proceed?

211
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,760
We're already in, so...

212
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,840
I'd biopsy the mass for testing.

213
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,190
Then I'd perform an embolization

214
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,380
of the arteries feeding the tumor.

215
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,190
Very good. Dr. Park, what does that do?

216
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,540
It should allow us to control the bleeding

217
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,480
so we can close her up

218
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,270
and leave the baby in place for two months.

219
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,230
That'll give the baby time to become viable outside the womb.

220
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,520
At that point, we go back in,

221
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,190
safely take out the baby and the mass.

222
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,530
Sounds like the right call to me.

223
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,920
We'll be performing an embolization

224
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,380
of the arteries feeding the tumor.

225
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,460
- I'll inform Chief Lim. - Not necessary.

226
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,430
It's protocol to run all decisions

227
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,950
about complex procedures by the Chief of Surgery.

228
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,260
There's only one clear path,

229
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,090
which means there is no decision.

230
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,980
In my office, please.

231
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,400
I didn't think you'd mind.

232
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,650
We always complained about Andrews and his red tape.

233
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,220
Well, I hoped that our relationship

234
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,310
was better than whatever you had with Andrews.

235
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,330
It is, but I know you're busy. You don't need to be bothered --

236
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,940
You know how this makes me look?

237
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,820
You know how this makes me look?

238
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,950
This job was on your to-do list.

239
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,200
Lab must have made a mistake.

240
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,290
I'll deal with it.

241
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,840
We might have a bigger issue

242
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,210
than you lying about the blood test.

243
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,390
I'm not lying.

244
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,330
Like I said, this is a bigger issue.

245
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,720
Shaun is distracted.

246
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,540
Well, why would he be --

247
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,330
Because you were at the dentist.

248
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,190
Nurse Hawks asked some questions.

249
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,600
Carly didn't invite Shaun to something,

250
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,480
and now he's worried

251
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,870
that they're not boyfriend and girlfriend.

252
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,890
So, did you talk to him?

253
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,710
No. That's what you do.

254
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,760
Think I put it on your list -- "Be kind and care" --

255
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,010
so I don't have to.

256
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,880
Okay. I'll talk to him.

257
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,220
Talk to Carly first.

258
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,770
You can do it when you drop off the blood vials

259
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,510
and pretend it's the second time.

260
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,370
This is good. It's good.

261
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,380
You were wasted there.

262
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,920
I was happy there.

263
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,980
I love that hospital.

264
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,700
I lo-- I love the staff and the patients.

265
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,250
It just... felt like home.

266
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,430
Here's a thought.

267
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,310
What if I come work with you?

268
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,780
I saw your waiting room. You need the help.

269
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,460
We have an office manager.

270
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,810
She doesn't manage. She's never there.

271
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,230
I-I was a nurse.

272
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,990
I could schedule your appointments.

273
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,830
I could, um, triage the walk-ins.

274
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,290
It's like a win-win.

275
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,040
I don't think we have the budget for --

276
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,790
for new employees.

277
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,910
Aaron, that's horse crap.

278
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,750
You're the president.

279
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,370
What's the real reason?

280
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,270
I-I think couples - that are apart now and then,

281
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,350
it's a good thing.

282
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,730
Couples together 24/7?

283
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,200
I mean, I don't want to get to the point where we come home

284
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,680
and we run to opposite sides of the house.

285
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,450
Okay.

286
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,940
Just a thought.

287
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,830
I'm just gonna... keep looking.

288
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,540
Hi, Carly.

289
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,310
Replacement vials.

290
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,700
For some reason, the bloodwork for Shaun's case

291
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,020
was never processed.

292
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,750
Oh, that doesn't sound right.

293
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,420
Why is not all that important.

294
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,400
But if you could just put a rush on them.

295
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,390
If the tests get delayed any longer,

296
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,060
then Shaun's surgery could get rescheduled.

297
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,570
There's no record of any bloodwork

298
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,620
being dropped off for Shaun.

299
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,020
If the surgery gets rescheduled,

300
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,800
then Shaun will lose his team, the team he's practiced with.

301
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,230
It might throw him, so if you could just --

302
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,850
Shaun doesn't get thrown by anything medical.

303
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,040
Shaun is already thrown.

304
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,330
For some reason, he has it in his head

305
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,410
that you dissed him or something,

306
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,740
that maybe there's a problem,

307
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,050
and now he seems distracted, upset.

308
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,060
I --

309
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,700
I wondered if you could speak with him,

310
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,030
let him know everything's okay.

311
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,020
I'll make sure to put a rush on the blood tests.

312
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,160
Thank you.

313
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,240
My wife says that the Earth is a womb

314
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,180
and that when you garden,

315
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,360
you become part of its birthing process.

316
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,580
Not that I mind sharing hobbies with her.

317
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,910
It keeps us close.

318
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,940
And I don't mind the dirt in my eyes.

319
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,440
Just could do with - a little less of the talking.

320
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,420
I feel you.

321
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,970
You don't by any chance possess the power of flight?

322
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,220
What?

323
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,390
You have a wing in your eye.

324
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,470
Sorry?

325
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,960
Just hold still.

326
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,910
Congratulations.

327
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,240
Your womb just gave birth to a bee.

328
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,480
Triplets, in fact.

329
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,600
Dr. Glassman, I need to compartmentalize.

330
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,390
Hi, Shaun.

331
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,410
Nurse Hawks says

332
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,280
girlfriends invite their boyfriends to get-togethers.

333
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,940
That means it's possible Carly did not invite me

334
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,550
because I am not her boyfriend,

335
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,870
but we make out and she wants to hold my hand

336
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,230
and she lets me touch her breasts.

337
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,570
Those are things you do with a boyfriend.

338
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,590
Now all I think about is Carly,

339
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,610
even when I'm supposed to be doing my job.

340
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,710
I do not like it.

341
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,810
I tried to talk to her, but I can't.

342
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,500
You can't talk to her?

343
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,550
I can't.

344
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,630
I need to compartmentalize.

345
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,030
Well, Shaun, you're -- you're very good at compartmentalizing.

346
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,050
Were you wearing your white lab coat

347
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,220
when you tried to talk to her?

348
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,430
N-no, I was in my surgical scrubs.

349
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,100
Okay, see, we all struggle to -- to separate our work life

350
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,990
with our personal life, right?

351
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,740
That's why we wear uniforms.

352
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,340
It tells us, it tells the world,

353
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,570
"This is what I have to focus on right now.

354
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,450
I can't worry about anything else."

355
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,980
- That makes sense. - Good.

356
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,410
So, when Carly's wearing her white lab coat,

357
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,980
then she's just a co-worker,

358
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,830
not a girl you happen to be seeing at the moment.

359
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,870
When you're wearing your white lab coat,

360
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,870
then you say to yourself, "I'm a doctor, damn it.

361
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,120
I'm not gonna worry about everything else."

362
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,020
Say to yourself, "I'm a doctor.

363
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,480
Romance doesn't matter."

364
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,210
I'm a doctor.

365
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,800
Romance doesn't matter.

366
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,530
I'm a doctor. Romance doesn't matter.

367
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,320
I am a doctor.

368
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,660
Romance doesn't matter.

369
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,300
I am a doctor.

370
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,120
Romance doesn't matter.

371
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,030
you're wearing a white lab coat.

372
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,870
You want to be a doctor and get the other bees out of my eye?

373
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,390
You make a fair point.

374
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,140
Looking for Murphy?

375
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:16,950
Yep.

376
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,440
- Blood tests being expedited? - Yes.

377
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,630
Did you own your mistake or blame some innocent clerk?

378
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,560
How did it feel? Is it eating at you?

379
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,350
You mean, how do I live one moment

380
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,340
behaving how you do constantly?

381
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,190
At least I'm consistent,

382
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,160
even when I'm going through my own issues.

383
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,240
Shaun?

384
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,160
Why aren't you wearing your white coat?

385
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,920
I am a civilian.

386
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,060
Medicine doesn't matter.

387
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,160
You're not leaving.

388
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,410
Your surgery is in six hours.

389
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,000
Did you speak to Carly?

390
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,890
I need to talk to Carly.

391
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,620
Shaun, why did we practice this morning?

392
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,020
Because I'm not good at communication.

393
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,060
Exactly.

394
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,920
But with practice, you can do it.

395
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,680
Talk to me.

396
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,930
Tell me the problem. Tell me how you feel.

397
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,420
Okay.

398
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,770
I have to talk to Carly.

399
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,610
Shaun, stop.

400
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,640
You don't have to talk to Carly.

401
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,750
Everything is fine.

402
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,320
I talked to her earlier,

403
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,140
and it was just all a misunderstanding.

404
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:36,500
Why did she not invite me over to meet her friends?

405
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,650
There were no friends.

406
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,940
Uh, the laughing you heard --

407
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,560
she thinks it must have been a podcast she was listening to.

408
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,400
I need to get my lab coat.

409
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,060
Told you you're better at this than I am.

410
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,330
Though you could have jumped in earlier.

411
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,380
We were able to do a biopsy, and the mass is non-malignant.

412
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,850
We've stabilized it, but it does still need to be removed.

413
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,840
When?

414
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,910
Two months.

415
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,180
By then, the baby will be viable outside the --

416
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,280
I don't feel well.

417
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,710
My vision's getting blurry.

418
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,160
Your blood pressure's tanking.

419
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,720
W-- Doctor, what's happening to her?

420
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,220
Page Dr. Melendez.

421
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,350
Hello.

422
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,260
My name is Dr. Shaun Murphy,

423
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,590
surgical resident year 3.

424
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,830
I will be assisted by Dr. Claire Browne

425
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,270
on today's open appendectomy.

426
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,170
I will not be putting on my number 7 sterile gloves myself,

427
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,130
as I am lead surgeon.

428
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,220
Nurse Fletch, can you adjust the overhead light?

429
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,490
Adjust to a 35-degree angle.

430
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,020
Nurse Hawks, please hand me the 10 blade.

431
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,750
The arterial embolization was rejected above the bladder.

432
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,340
The mass is seeping blood.

433
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,220
We have to go in again, or she'll slowly bleed to death.

434
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,640
We deliver the baby early,

435
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,850
have an incubator and ventilator ready in the O.R.

436
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,530
Even with maximal NICU support,

437
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,080
the baby's chance of survival is around 15% to 20%.

438
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,090
Maybe we were wrong the first time.

439
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,960
Maybe we can leave the child and work around her.

440
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,370
We can suction-resect this friable lesion

441
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,450
and control the bleeding better with the argon beam coagulator.

442
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,120
Very easy to go too far, cause a uterine rupture.

443
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,000
But if we don't screw up,

444
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,330
the baby gets to stay in the womb and grow to term.

445
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,410
Nice.

446
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,830
I'll go book an O.R.

447
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,480
Wait.

448
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,270
There's one more thing we need to do.

449
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,110
It's a good plan.

450
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,170
But the safest course of action

451
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,620
is to deliver prematurely and remove the mass.

452
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,480
By "Deliver prematurely,"

453
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,410
you mean terminate the pregnancy.

454
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,710
Not necessarily. But yes.

455
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,310
To save her life.

456
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,040
If I place internal iliac artery balloon catheters,

457
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,440
I can control most bleeding as it happens.

458
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,520
Most?

459
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,750
I've performed surgeries that were a lot more complicated

460
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,840
under much more difficult circumstances.

461
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,500
When you had no other option.

462
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,700
You have a choice here, a safer choice.

463
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,500
The mother's life takes precedence.

464
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,930
That's our policy.

465
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,810
Are we sure it's hers?

466
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,200
Okay. Go make your case.

467
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,670
Thank you.

468
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,540
Neil?

469
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,890
Thank you for getting my approval.

470
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,010
It's your job.

471
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,040
I will now use electrocautery

472
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,070
to incise through both the fascia and muscles.

473
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,040
Can I please get a measurement on

474
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,130
the patient's pulse, blood pressure, and temperature?

475
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,470
Pulse is at 65, pressure 118/82,

476
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,010
and temp is normal, at 98.6 degrees.

477
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,120
Thank you for hearing and responding.

478
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,480
The appendix can be removed in various ways.

479
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,050
I will be using the suture ligation technique.

480
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,980
Dr. Browne, can you identify the ascending colon

481
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,640
and its taenia coli?

482
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,890
I see it.

483
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,770
Thank you.

484
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,870
Please free the appendix-mesoappendix complex

485
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,250
from its adjacent tissue.

486
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,690
Babcock clamps.

487
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,700
We must have nicked an ileocolic branch of the SMA.

488
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,210
Get suction on it, Dr. Browne.

489
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,550
Nurse Fletch, please use lap sponges to stem the bleed.

490
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,640
If she hemorrhages, she could die?

491
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,570
That is a possibility.

492
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,700
But if you're successful, then I complete my pregnancy.

493
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,450
No. It's too risky.

494
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,690
If Dr. Melendez says he can do it...

495
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,670
Do the other surgery --

496
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,110
the one where you take the baby out and you save Patty.

497
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,370
I'm the one carrying the baby.

498
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,260
I'm the one going through the surgery.

499
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:46,840
It's not your choice to make.

500
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,330
I-I didn't want this baby.

501
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,750
Sorry. I j--

502
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,130
Look, we can have another child some other time.

503
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,090
But I can't replace you.

504
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,520
I don't want another baby.

505
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:17,330
I want the one that's been giving me morning sickness

506
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,400
for the last 23 weeks.

507
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,450
I want the one who's been giving me heartburn,

508
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,910
constipation, and insomnia.

509
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,250
That's the baby that I want to hold.

510
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,960
And I couldn't live with the guilt

511
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,010
if I killed our baby to save my own life.

512
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,670
Performing a suture ligation

513
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,740
with two interrupted 2-0 vicryl sutures.

514
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,460
Dr. Browne, cauterize the exposed mucosa.

515
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:24,840
I may owe Dr. Lim an apology.

516
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,240
Continue.

517
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,300
Uh, yes.

518
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:33,120
We still need to copiously irrigate the wound

519
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,700
with normal saline,

520
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,200
grasp the peritoneum with two straight clamps,

521
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,520
and close it all up with a continuous 3-0 vicryl stitch.

522
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,320
Irrigating.

523
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,110
Straight clamp, please, N-nurse --

524
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,700
Straight clamp, please, Nurse Hawks.

525
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,550
You are handing them to me incorrectly.

526
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,710
I'm sorry?

527
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,400
You are handing them to me incorrectly.

528
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,150
This is how I always do it.

529
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,810
You do it wrong.

530
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,100
- Shaun -- - I don't know how else to do it.

531
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,360
You can do it the right way.

532
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,620
What's the right way?

533
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,670
- The efficient way. - Efficient?

534
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,440
Yes.

535
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,380
There is historical precedence to my preference.

536
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,670
Please just take the clamp.

537
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,470
- I can't. - Of course you can.

538
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,950
Take the damn clamp.

539
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,040
You need to leave.

540
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,550
Nurse Hawks...

541
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,470
you need to leave the O.R.

542
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,640
Leave now!

543
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,710
Dr. Reznick, please cauterize those bleeders

544
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,200
with the argon coagulator.

545
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,750
I nicked an artery. She's hemorrhaging!

546
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,930
Hang 4 units on the rapid infuser.

547
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,250
Get me a vascular clamp.

548
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,190
The surgery was successful.

549
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,480
The patient's vital signs are stable --

550
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,650
You can't solve your interpersonal problems

551
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,230
by making people go away.

552
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:32,010
There was a bleed.

553
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,570
You threw the nurse out of surgery because of a bleed?

554
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,600
Yes.

555
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,280
Because we nicked the ileocolic branch of the SMA,

556
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,450
Nurse Fletch was attending to the lap sponges,

557
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,620
so Nurse Hawks had to hand me the straight clamp,

558
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,610
and she did it wrong.

559
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,860
And she refused to do it right.

560
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,880
Did you tell her how to do it right?

561
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,260
I wanted my straight clamp handed

562
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,510
to me at a 45-degree angle

563
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,760
so I do not have to bend my wrist as much

564
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,060
to go from handoff to the surgical field.

565
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,770
Did you explain all of that to her?

566
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,210
I told her to do it the efficient way.

567
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,700
I want you to apologize to Nurse Hawks.

568
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,950
N-no. No.

569
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,830
Why would I apologize because she did not do it right?

570
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,900
Because you didn't, either.

571
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,580
When you're lead surgeon, it means you're in charge,

572
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,740
which means if anything goes wrong, it's your fault.

573
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,320
Do you understand?

574
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,950
You've gotta make this right.

575
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,830
Okay.

576
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,210
You could have stepped in and kept the situation from escalating.

577
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,930
You have your way of dealing with Shaun,

578
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,180
and so do I.

579
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,830
We need better control of the bleeding.

580
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,250
Clamp off the common iliac.

581
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,820
There's too much blood to see in here.

582
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,700
We have to take the baby out.

583
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,930
Page the on-call neonatologist.

584
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,680
Let them know they're gonna have a 23-week-old girl

585
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,080
coming their way very soon.

586
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,850
Second time in as many days you've dropped by unexpectedly.

587
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,400
I'm starting to think you like me.

588
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,570
I got a job offer.

589
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,400
Well, there you go. That was quick.

590
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,570
Let's go celebrate.

591
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,180
Well, I'm not gonna take the offer.

592
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,370
I want to come work here with you.

593
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,160
Well, we've already talked about that.

594
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,230
You talked. I listened.

595
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,100
Now it's my turn to talk.

596
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,980
We got married to be here for each other,

597
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,240
even when the other one didn't know they need it.

598
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,050
You're so busy with your patients,

599
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,460
you don't see that the clinic is starting to suffer.

600
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,840
Right now, it's double-booked appointments.

601
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,720
Next, it could be the wrong medication prescribed.

602
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,100
I would never let that happen.

603
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,350
I'm a good partner.

604
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,500
I'm good at home, on the weekends.

605
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,420
I could be equally as good here in this office.

606
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,800
Okay, if it doesn't work out, I'll quit.

607
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,050
Or you can fire me.

608
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,900
No harm, no foul.

609
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,180
Uh, nothing is ever as simple as "no harm, no foul."

610
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,230
Got a résumé?

611
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:33,860
Well, I was hoping to avoid that.

612
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,140
I read a study that said

613
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,230
sharing a cup of coffee with colleagues promotes professionalism.

614
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,080
My cup is empty

615
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,990
because I do not like the way coffee makes me feel.

616
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,660
I've had a long day. Can I just enjoy my lunch?

617
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,120
Chief Lim asked me to apologize to you.

618
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,580
Okay.

619
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:33,840
Okay.

620
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,280
The earliest known drawing of a pivoting surgical instrument

621
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,220
dates back to 1500 B.C.

622
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,410
on a tomb at Thebes, Egypt --

623
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:53,200
This does not sound like the beginning of an apology.

624
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,750
I want to explain why I prefer the straight clamp

625
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,340
handed to me at a 45-degree angle.

626
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,590
Putting it in historical context will help.

627
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,590
You need to stop.

628
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,010
In the ninth century,

629
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,050
Albucasis, known as "the father of surgery" --

630
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,720
You need to go away.

631
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,540
No.

632
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,970
I need you to understand

633
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,770
because if you see why I'm right,

634
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,880
you will see there is no reason for me to apologize.

635
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,370
She's gone into unstable V-tach.

636
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,390
Dr. Reznick, we're gonna need the defibrillator.

637
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,110
Charging.

638
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,150
Clear.

639
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,420
Continue compressions.

640
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,160
Give me one milligram of epinephrine.

641
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,910
She's gone into V-fib. Shock again.

642
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:50,950
Charging.

643
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,460
Clear.

644
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:57,630
Alright, crack her chest. I'm gonna do an open-heart massage.

645
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,050
Heart's exposed.

646
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,640
Starting the massage.

647
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,190
Internal cardiac paddles.

648
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,190
Charging.

649
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,280
Clear.

650
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,860
Again.

651
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,950
Charge. Clear.

652
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,160
Again!

653
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,910
Charge.

654
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,750
Clear.

655
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,190
Let's open the uterus and get the baby.

656
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,500
All you had to do was say you're sorry.

657
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,360
I tried to explain why the straight clamp --

658
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,320
N-No, I-I don't hear the word "sorry" in there.

659
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
I-I don't hear any taking of responsibility.

660
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,860
You said I had to make this right.

661
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,570
An apology seemed to be just one possible way --

662
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,040
Shaun, she filed a complaint.

663
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,000
- No. No! - Yes. Yes.

664
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,290
- You have a problem with communication. I was... - Yes, but I am --

665
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,610
So I'm going to make this very, very clear.

666
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,380
You screwed up.

667
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,670
- No. - Yes. Yeah, you were wrong.

668
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,710
- No! - You are wrong.

669
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,070
You screwed up.

670
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,010
This incident will be noted in your file.

671
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,580
And if this or anything like this happens again,

672
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,670
that will be the end of your residency.

673
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,670
Now, what do you have to say?

674
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,850
You're sorry?

675
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,850
I failed.

676
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,560
I'm sorry.

677
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,860
Good.

678
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:29,700
Now go say those words to Nurse Hawks.

679
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,240
And mean them.

680
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,640
I spoke to Carly.

681
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,040
You're a terrible fairy godmother.

682
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,410
You swoop in, you enchant the hero with a lie,

683
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,980
and then you carry on like you made his world a better place.

684
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,960
Shaun was about to talk to Carly.

685
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,210
That's what he needed to do.

686
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,630
I think Carly's pissed at him.

687
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:14,410
Fine. Then she's pissed at him. They deal with it.

688
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,680
Shaun's problem is communication.

689
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,590
You made it worse.

690
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,510
Shaun needed to get his head straight

691
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,430
before his first solo surgery.

692
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,460
That is what I did. I fixed the problem.

693
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,630
You buried a problem.

694
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,420
Which seems to be your general approach to life right now.

695
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,640
Hey, Shaun.

696
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,100
Hello.

697
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,810
We need to talk.

698
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,740
You're mad at me.

699
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,200
Yes.

700
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,840
Because whenever you have a problem,

701
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,660
I hear it from Glassman or Claire or Morgan --

702
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,540
anyone but you.

703
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,550
I'm sorry.

704
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,420
Good.

705
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,930
Shaun, stop!

706
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,990
This is the problem.

707
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,430
You have to tell me what's bothering you.

708
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,280
Why did you not invite me to your get-together last Sunday?

709
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,990
I had some old friends over.

710
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,740
We were gonna drink and play a little poker.

711
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,620
My friends are snarky.

712
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,790
They tease and play practical jokes on each other.

713
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,710
And I knew that you wouldn't like that

714
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,140
and that it would get weird,

715
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,630
so I decided not to invite you.

716
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,880
That's it.

717
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,630
The whole story.

718
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,310
My father always sent me to my room

719
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,310
when he would play poker with his friends.

720
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,650
They were loud, and they would tease me.

721
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,090
They said I talked funny.

722
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,570
Is that what your friends were going to say?

723
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,470
No, Shaun. Of course not.

724
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,410
Then what were they going to do?

725
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,500
Nothing, I guess.

726
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,500
It's just...

727
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,750
sometimes when you bring the guy that you're dating into the mix,

728
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,550
that relationship changes.

729
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,670
It can be a disaster.

730
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,340
Was it a disaster

731
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,850
every time you brought a date to meet your friends?

732
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,620
No. Some fit right in.

733
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,350
Then how did you know?

734
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,900
How did you know it would be a disaster with me?

735
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,870
I didn't.

736
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,830
I made an assumption.

737
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,870
And I shouldn't have done that.

738
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,920
I'm sorry, too.

739
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,880
Can you forgive me?

740
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,560
I wasn't a great girlfriend.

741
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,480
Girlfriend?

742
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,420
You're my girlfriend?

743
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,360
Yeah.

744
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,450
Does that mean I'm your boyfriend?

745
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,660
You are.

746
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,280
I forgive you.

747
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Can I kiss you?

748
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,420
Okay.

749
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,910
I'm glad we talked.

750
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,220
Me too.

751
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,620
I'll introduce you to my friends next week.

752
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,950
No, thank you.

753
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,270
I would not like to meet your friends.

754
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,690
- Okay. - Okay.
