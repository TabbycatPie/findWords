33
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
Previously on The Good Doctor...

34
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,140
Shaun, I have cancer.

35
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,050
I have to undergo brain surgery, which is really scary.

36
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,600
To be clear, Jared, I don't want you here.

37
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,630
I fought for my job.

38
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,690
You compromised your integrity.

39
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,520
My former mentor is head of the surgical residency program

40
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,170
at Denver Memorial Hospital.

42
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,530
A surgeon needs to communicate.

43
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,630
Can Dr. Murphy do that? Can he do that under stress?

44
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,220
Can he do that knowing that a human life

45
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,790
literally hangs in the balance?

46
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:26,560
Shaun?

47
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,250
If Shaun proves anything less than excellent,

48
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,740
I will resign my position as president of this hospital.

49
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,340
I know why Caden has DIC.

50
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,600
It was my mistake.

51
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,300
I have to tell Dr. Andrews about the mistake I made.

52
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,790
Shaun, you can't.

53
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,950
I'm not gonna ask him to lie to save my job.

54
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,220
It's up to Shaun.

55
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,730
Hello?

56
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,420
Yes, of course.

57
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,930
Dr. Murphy, the president will see you now.

58
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,330
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

59
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,600
I'm a surgical resident at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

60
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,890
So, what did Andrews have to say to you?

61
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,710
Shaun.

62
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,740
You've exceeded my expectations

63
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,750
in terms of expertise and technical execution.

64
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,420
But your communication skills are sorely lacking.

65
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,870
That has to change if you want to stay here at St. Bonaventure.

66
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,150
He told me I exceeded expectations.

67
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,420
Great.

68
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,860
- Sounds, sounds great, Shaun. - Yes.

69
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,970
I think you should have gone to your review.

70
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,990
Since it's my last day,

71
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,960
not much opportunity to make use of the feedback.

72
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,100
Dr. Andrews could have some wisdom

73
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,720
that you could use in Denver at your next job.

74
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,060
Even if I did care about his opinion,

75
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,310
it was made pretty obvious by the fact that we're here.

76
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,790
This is Glassman's project.

77
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,670
Andrews thinks it's a money trap.

78
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,950
How'd your review go, Claire?

79
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,830
Went well.

80
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,790
Andrews said I connected nicely,

81
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,110
that I care about people.

82
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,990
Interesting.

83
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,410
I'd have thought he'd want you to be more aggressive.

84
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,310
I think you need to be more assertive, Dr. Browne.

85
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,330
Okay.

86
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,740
Nope.

87
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,700
What'd he say about you?

88
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,250
Figure out how to be a little less self-centered

89
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,820
and realize you're part of a team?

90
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,270
You're sometimes overbearing.

91
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,930
Often egotistical.

92
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,740
You need to be more of a team player.

93
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,820
Melanie Arnott.

94
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,610
The patient has pulmonary hypertension.

95
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,830
The only treatment is medication,

96
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,520
which reduces the lung blood pressure,

97
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,270
but not enough.

98
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,250
Her heart's failing due to the extra strain.

99
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,590
That is a factually-correct diagnosis.

100
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,040
What about a fix?

101
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,730
Isn't it just a... transplant?

102
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,700
Nope.

103
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,260
There's nothing inherently wrong with Melanie's heart.

104
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,370
It's healthy. Just needs a little bit of help.

105
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,650
So, we're gonna leave her current heart inside

106
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,650
and slide in another one to support it.

107
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,190
A piggyback transplant?

108
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,400
Nice, huh?

109
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,530
Do you live in a tent?

110
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,780
Yeah.

111
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,820
I lived in a tent, too.

112
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,520
It wasn't very good, so I moved to a bus.

113
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,400
You should move to a bus.

114
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,070
You will be much less likely to develop ulcerative tinea pedis.

115
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,320
Very early stages.

116
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,010
Just keep it dry and clean, and we'll give you some...

117
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,720
Would you rather we continue to discuss this inside?

118
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,660
We are discussing things with the patient

119
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,850
that are potentially sensitive, so...

120
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,200
We're done with the patient.

121
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,050
Did Andrews happen to speak to you about communication?

122
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,990
Yes.

123
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,340
I'm trying very hard.

124
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,970
It's definitely something you should work on.

125
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,670
Things might be different, more difficult for you,

126
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,590
now Glassman's not around, so...

127
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,050
Dr. Glassman is still around.

128
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,350
He's alive and he is not going to die.

129
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,830
He's meeting his oncologist today.

130
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,990
You...

131
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,440
You didn't go with him?

132
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,340
No.

133
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,730
That would be stupid.

134
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,980
I am a resident.

135
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,300
I don't know as much about brain cancer

136
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,280
as a double board certified neuro-oncologist.

137
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,930
True, but this has got to be challenging for him emotionally.

138
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,500
I can't help him.

139
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,850
Emotionally.

140
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,570
Excuse me, please.

141
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,200
Excuse me, please.

142
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,600
Thank you for keeping me waiting.

143
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,670
We doctors are busy, important people.

144
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,710
Yeah, we doctors are.

145
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,780
So, pre-op clearance, surgery,

146
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,250
radiation, and chemo.

147
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,370
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

148
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,810
I hope you don't mind if I start with pre-op.

149
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,530
Did you change the policy on pot use?

150
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,930
Are you using again? Should I worry?

151
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,790
I'm clean.

152
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,450
I miss it, but I'm clean.

153
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,050
They test me every week now.

154
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,930
Good.

155
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,470
I think you had me reinstated as your last official act

156
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,530
before they booted you as president

157
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,720
because I am the best oncologist around

158
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,620
and you would like to get the best treatment.

159
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,650
Yeah.

160
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,390
So, I'd like to ensure that the brain,

161
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,890
in this instance, my brain,

162
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,090
stays as dry as possible during surgery,

163
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,940
maintain minimal swelling.

164
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,370
I would still like to be able to swing my 9-iron

165
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,250
when we're done here.

166
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,720
Of course, it's also possible that you had me reinstated

167
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,340
because you'd like an oncologist who thinks they owe you

168
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,890
and you want to push them around.

169
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,610
Look, Dr. Blaize,

170
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,580
I am, like any other patient,

171
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,520
entitled to have a say in my own treatment,

172
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,510
but unlike any other patient,

173
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,210
I have spent my entire adult life digging into people's brains.

174
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,680
So, if you think I'm gonna sit around and watch,

175
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,800
you're mistaken.

176
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,210
Well, if you think you can operate on yourself,

177
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,040
I'd happily add you to the list of potential surgeons.

178
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,970
Today, you're gonna be waiting.

179
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,160
And waiting.

180
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,740
And waiting.

181
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,240
Test, test, test.

182
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,530
You've had them all before. I want them again. My versions.

183
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,550
You free all day?

184
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,730
Yeah, sure.

185
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,610
I'm free.

186
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,530
Sir?

187
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,870
We're going to need you to give those back.

188
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,860
What's your name?

189
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,410
I'm Harry. These are my meds.

190
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,300
Those pills are for people with chlamydia, Harry.

191
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,800
No. They're all the same.

192
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,550
See, I know better! That's why I have to hide out on the streets.

193
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,370
I had to move next door to Mr. Googly Eyes.

194
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,980
I... I trust him!

195
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,470
He's my friend!

196
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,990
- I trust him. - Okay.

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,900
- I trust him. - Okay.

198
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,490
- Disorganized thinking, - He's there.

199
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,430
- paranoia, and delusions. - He's always watching me.

200
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,470
I think you have schizophrenia, Harry.

201
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,490
Do you have chlamydia, as well?

202
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,130
Harry?

203
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,300
Harry, are you okay?

204
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,750
That smells very bad.

205
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,120
I get that this is rare. Exciting.

206
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,790
The sort of surgery you guys must jump at doing.

207
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,300
I... I just... I want to make sure that we don't...

208
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,330
We're not.

209
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,740
I have three months left.

210
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,370
This will give me at least 10 more years.

211
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,790
Should give you 10 more years, yes.

212
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Elliot, I understand your concerns...

213
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,690
And Dr. Melendez is one of the best cardiac surgeons around.

214
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,970
Dr. Andrews told us all about you

215
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,310
when he convinced me to come here for surgery instead of...

216
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,010
You spoke to Dr. Andrews.

217
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,050
And they both already spent half the morning raving to the press.

218
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,790
Well, that's... that's very kind.

219
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,740
You spoke to the press?

220
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,450
You spoke to the patient? My patient?

221
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
As I explained to Elliot and Melanie,

222
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,010
the press attention is a necessary element

223
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,390
for funding this surgery.

224
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,660
But as you didn't explain to them,

225
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,520
it's simultaneously a vanity project

226
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
to create buzz for your new presidency.

227
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,680
As I didn't explain to them,

228
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,520
this surgery can change the way

229
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,870
our entire hospital is perceived.

230
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,220
I'm hoping this buzz, as you put it,

231
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,090
will help us establish a surgical center for excellence.

232
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,810
It'll be a nice feather in the cap

233
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,190
for whoever replaces me as Chief of Surgery.

234
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,770
Okay.

235
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,340
Swill your mouth out with alcohol now.

236
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,610
Never said no to that.

237
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,160
You will have to spit.

238
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,600
Oh. Well...

239
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,350
Over here.

240
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,840
Are you having trouble with your neck, Harry?

241
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,700
It's stiff.

242
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,870
A stiff neck can be an early indicator of bacterial meningitis.

243
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,280
There are many possible explanations for a stiff neck,

244
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,970
most of which are much more likely than bacterial meningitis...

245
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,270
If the abscess has invaded the meninges of his brain,

246
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,450
it could be exacerbating his paranoia.

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,520
We need to bring him back to the hospital for a lumbar puncture.

248
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:58,950
Come on, Shaun.

249
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,810
There's nothing to lose by trying.

250
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,130
I have something to lose.

251
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,360
It's not my last day at St. Bonaventure.

252
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,700
Dr. Andrews won't be happy.

253
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,000
Look, it's my responsibility.

254
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,300
If anything happens, I'll take the blame.

255
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:14,950
Okay?

256
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,020
Okay.

257
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,320
It's probably best that Jared isn't here on his last day.

258
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,780
It's got to be awkward.

259
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,380
I mean, how do you say goodbye to someone

260
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,070
who must have meant that much to you?

261
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,220
What Jared and I had is over,

262
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,470
and it was never all that much of a big deal, anyway.

263
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:40,960
You worked with him for over a year.

264
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,910
You were sleeping with him for most of that time.

265
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,000
For me, anyway,

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,570
you can't sleep with someone and not feel anything.

267
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,880
And for you...

268
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,200
you're way more decent and caring than I am.

269
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,130
Melanie has an aortic aneurysm?

270
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,860
Two hearts beating into that...

271
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,340
Yeah. Not so good.

272
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,130
We could reinforce the dilated aorta with an endovascular stent.

273
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,100
Well, we can't attach the donor heart's aorta

274
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,920
to an aneurysm over a metal tube.

275
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,070
Why not resect the dilated tissue

276
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,040
and reapproximate the artery ends?

277
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,210
Great.

278
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,460
Except the wall is inherently weakened.

279
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,560
How long do you think it'll take to dilate again?

280
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,320
It was nice while it lasted.

281
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,130
I'll let Andrews know.

282
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,970
I didn't want to say anything, I'm not entirely sure,

283
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,090
but you suggested resecting the dilated tissue.

284
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,480
What if we resect the entire abnormal segment,

285
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,510
shorten the ascending aorta...

286
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,610
You were very right not to be entirely sure.

287
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,410
You need to have enough aorta to plug in the donor hear...

288
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,100
Actually, a version of that could maybe work.

289
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,490
We'd reduce the risk of the aortic aneurysm

290
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,660
if we used a Teflon graft.

291
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
I, um...

292
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,540
I didn't know you lived in a tent.

293
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,540
Yes.

294
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,560
We got to travel lots.

295
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,450
We saw all of Natrona County, Wyoming.

296
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,380
What was your favorite part?

297
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,730
My brother.

298
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,180
He took care of me.

299
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,850
He knew I needed help.

300
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,670
Now I'm fine on my own.

301
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,270
Mary had a little lamb

302
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,580
Keep still.

303
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,270
Little lamb, li...

304
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,700
Don't you want to help Glassman the way your brother helped you?

305
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,330
I can help people with medicine.

306
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,870
And you can help Dr. Glassman just by being there.

307
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,140
With him.

308
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,210
Letting him know you're his friend.

309
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,720
He knows I'm his friend.

310
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,390
I don't have to be there to tell him that.

311
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,760
Okay, Harry, we're done,

312
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,140
but you have to stay here for a while.

313
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,370
Got a minute?

314
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,650
I get it.

315
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,010
It's your last day.

316
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,960
You hate me, want to prove me wrong.

317
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,150
Prove that you're a better doctor

318
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,750
than I gave you credit and leave here with a victory.

319
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,680
It was my medical opinion

320
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,800
that he could have bacterial meningitis.

321
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,130
And if you're right, then I owe you an apology.

322
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,330
But if you're wrong,

323
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,960
then I will be on the phone to Denver,

324
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,420
and I will make your life infinitely more complicated

325
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,080
than you think you're making mine.

326
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,860
You don't seem disappointed.

327
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,790
You think I like passing up on a once-in-a-lifetime surgery?

328
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,100
I think you don't mind telling me

329
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,330
that a surgery I publicly supported can't be done.

330
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,990
I spent half a day with my team trying to figure out a way to make it work.

331
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,670
We think there's a way to do the surgery

332
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,610
by using a Teflon graft.

335
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,810
We cut out the entire aneurysm segment and replace it.

336
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,110
The dilation starts above the aortic root.

337
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,460
That leaves enough room to plug in the donor heart.

338
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,620
That's a great idea.

339
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,650
Isn't it?

340
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,030
There's two hearts, not one.

341
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,710
There'd be about a 20% chance the graft would blow at the suture line.

342
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,260
It's not worth it.

343
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,970
Whose idea was it?

344
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,970
It was a joint thing, we were all talking, and we...

345
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,110
Come on, Claire.

346
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,040
You know that's not true.

347
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,650
It was Claire's idea.

348
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,800
That's very gracious of you, Dr. Reznick.

349
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,510
I thought we talked about this.

350
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,530
Andrews was right.

351
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,140
I did think Harry had meningitis,

352
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,510
but maybe I only really believed it

353
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,250
because I wanted to prove him wrong.

354
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,350
If this test is negative,

355
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,030
we've wasted the hospital's resources

356
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,440
on my self-indulgent, pointless gesture.

357
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,210
Your results are ready.

358
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,260
We've wasted hospital resources

359
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,750
on a self-indulgent, pointless gesture.

360
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,490
Don't worry, Jared.

361
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,920
You are young.

362
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,370
There is still time for you

363
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,590
to fulfill your potential somewhere else.

364
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,520
I think one day, you're going to be very happy.

366
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,560
I can unload the Mobile Clinic by myself.

367
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,930
I haven't been assigned anything else to do.

368
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,710
- I'll help you. - Do something else.

369
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,640
I'm sure there's better ways you can be spending your time.

370
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,840
I'm halfway through a chapter of my book.

371
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:45,880
It's very good.

372
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,670
But you shouldn't be alone on your last day.

373
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,520
Seriously?

374
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,980
You're worried about me being on my own?

375
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,060
The guy going to a new job. Not the... not the guy facing death.

376
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,150
- Not the guy who mentored you for... - He's not facing death.

377
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,440
No, no, he's facing...

378
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,040
He's facing death, Shaun.

379
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,200
That's all he's thinking about

380
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,110
in every one of those waiting rooms.

381
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,720
Are you scared?

382
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,230
And you think by... by separating yourself,

383
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,420
you'll make it easier?

384
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,190
It does.

385
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,190
For you, Shaun. Not for him.

386
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,090
I'm going to finish my chapter.

388
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,510
How's everything going?

389
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,380
Pretty good.

390
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,980
Pretty good?

391
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,310
It's your first week running a major hospital.

392
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,500
How pretty bad has it been?

393
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,960
You heard about the piggyback surgery falling through.

394
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,780
Read your draft press release. When does that go out?

395
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,100
As soon as Melendez informs the family.

396
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,370
I was sure he'd seize the chance

397
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,200
when Dr. Browne came up with a potential fix.

398
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,160
He's arrogant, always just does stuff,

399
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,620
knowing he'll find a way.

400
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,310
You assumed he'd make the call you wanted.

401
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,650
It is his call.

402
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,470
What would Dr. Glassman have done?

403
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,600
He held on to the presidency long enough.

404
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,240
He must have been doing something right.

405
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,530
Don't buy into his fuzzy warmth, Marcus.

406
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,060
He was a manipulator.

407
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,340
He manipulated the board into hiring Dr. Murphy,

408
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,610
and he always found a way to do exactly what he wanted to do.

409
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,340
Sitting around waiting for tests is a waste of my time,

410
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,460
much less yours.

411
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,990
I know. I told Jared that.

412
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,590
I wanted to read my book,

413
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,230
but he kept saying that I should just be here with you.

414
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,140
But then I realized

415
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,080
that I could be here with you and also read my book.

416
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,610
I want you to stop doing that.

420
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,250
Harry has kaleidoscopic disintegration.

421
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,710
We thought he had schizophrenia,

422
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,860
but he does not.

423
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,720
He has a brain tumor.

424
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,160
Shaun. Is everything okay?

425
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,990
I have a solution! I need to find Jared!

426
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,830
Can I ask you something important really quickly?

427
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,320
- I need to find Jared! - This is about Jared.

428
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:06,990
How is he?

429
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,910
Is that your important question?

430
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,580
It's just... It's his last day.

431
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,000
No, I'm sorry. Uh, you should go.

432
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,040
Just...

433
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,250
Say hello to him for me, okay?

434
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,220
Hello.

435
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,560
Also, your day is not over.

436
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,410
Harry doesn't have schizophrenia.

437
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,790
He has a brain tumor.

438
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,460
Did you go and see Glassman?

439
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,440
Yes, that's where I got the idea.

440
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,790
Harry's tumor won't kill him,

441
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,750
but removing it might change him back

442
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,160
to who he was before.

443
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,050
I was hoping Andrews wouldn't bother

444
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,120
following through on the threat to call Denver.

445
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,970
I do this, Shaun,

446
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,500
and I really don't leave him any choice.

447
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,090
We need to bring Harry in for an MRI to confirm the diagnosis.

448
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,150
You need to help me find him

449
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,260
because I can't do it alone.

450
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,530
Have you told the piggyback patient the surgery's off?

451
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,700
Not yet.

452
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,240
How come?

453
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,130
I haven't gotten around to it.

454
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,660
Is it because you're wondering if you made the right call?

455
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,540
I'm not gonna do it.

456
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,770
The Teflon graft isn't worth the risk.

457
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,060
That's a judgement call.

458
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,310
Yeah. My judgement.

459
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,560
Your judgement's biased.

460
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,600
- And yours isn't? - Of course mine is.

461
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,420
But as you've made quite clear,

462
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,840
mine doesn't matter.

463
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,150
You're biased because if this fails,

464
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,860
you will publicly pay a huge price

465
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,070
and if it succeeds, I will reap a huge windfall,

466
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,100
and I think both those scenarios are deeply unpleasant to you.

467
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,110
But the only issue that matters is,

468
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,040
are you surgeon enough to pull this off?

469
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,360
I think you are.

470
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,400
Am I wrong?

471
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,070
Get out of my office.

472
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,490
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

473
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,620
Have you seen Harry? He lives in a tent.

474
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,520
- He's about 6-foot tall with red hair. - He lives in a...

475
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,580
He lives in a...

476
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,520
- Have you seen a guy named Harry? - Hello.

477
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,150
- No?  - Have you seen Harry?

478
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:51,940
Hello.

479
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,360
Have you seen Harry? He lives in a...

480
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,450
We need to find Harry, you don't under...

481
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,410
Have... Okay, you don't... ...understand.

482
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,410
Okay.

483
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,960
Okay, we... We need to find Harry.

484
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,380
Harry! Harry!

485
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,590
- Shaun. - Okay.

486
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,510
What the hell is wrong with you?

487
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,930
We need to find...

488
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,680
Hello. Harry!

489
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,980
Okay.

490
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,330
Sorry, he needs help.

491
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,190
We need to find him. We need to...

492
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,420
- Shaun, Shaun, it's okay. - It's not okay.

493
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,920
- Shaun. It's okay. - No.

494
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,070
It's not okay. We need to find Harry.

495
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,010
- We need to find him. - Shaun.

496
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,740
Okay, please be... Can you please be quiet?

497
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,260
We found an issue.

498
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,110
An aneurysm near your heart.

499
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,680
So, we can't do the surgery?

500
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,890
We have a solution.

501
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,800
It's an addition to what we had originally planned.

502
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,320
Teflon graft.

503
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,980
Finally time to prepare you for your surgery, Melanie.

504
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,480
Thank you.

505
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,530
Nurse should be by shortly.

506
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,160
This surgery...

507
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,330
It was already complicated, and now...

508
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:28,290
How confident are you this graft will work?

509
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,000
There are always risks.

510
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,840
But I believe I can make it work.

511
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,220
Thank you.

512
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,020
That's it, Shaun. Keep holding it. Good.

513
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,660
- Hold. - Good.

514
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,960
Keep your eyes closed.

515
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,790
- Okay. - Feel the scalpel, Shaun.

516
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,150
We need to find Harry.

517
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,170
- I know. - No.

518
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,000
Hey, Shaun, it's okay.

519
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,490
It's... It's not okay.

520
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,910
- We need to... We need to find Harry. - Hey. Hey, Shaun.

521
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,660
- We need... - Shaun! Look over there. Look.

522
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,250
Remember Harry said he had a friend.

523
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,670
Harry...

524
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,960
Harry and Mr. Googly Eyes.

525
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,420
Yes.

526
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,680
Yes, Harry.

527
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,260
Har... Harry!

528
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,930
- Harry! - What do you want?

529
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,740
This is... this is my home.

530
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,930
My home! Go away!

531
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,520
We're not coming in, Harry.

532
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,650
Okay, we... We made a mistake,

533
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,290
and we want to run an MRI scan on you, because we...

534
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,960
Always mistakes, always blaming others.

535
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,990
You see, I knew you were a doctor. I knew it. I knew it.

536
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,000
We think you have a brain tumor. We can help you.

537
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,550
- Didn't I say go away? - If we can just get you back...

538
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,050
- If we can just... - I said go away.

539
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,300
I said go away.

540
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,160
Edward Austin Thomas.

541
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,670
Harry is not who you really are.

542
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,110
You are Edward Austin Thomas.

543
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,010
You live at 3458 Brookland Avenue.

544
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,860
I have a neurological condition.

545
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,780
I will always have it.

546
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,680
You have a neurological condition, too.

547
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,120
But yours can be cured.

548
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,180
You just need some surgery,

549
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,130
then you can be Edward Austin Thomas again.

550
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,390
You're not a doctor, are you?

551
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,610
Let's go.

552
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,210
Knife.

553
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,650
Another thing about being president,

554
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,350
it's always your ass on the line.

555
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,970
But ultimately, you're just a bystander.

557
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,900
He has a wife and daughter.

558
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,840
I checked out the address, and it all adds up...

559
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,330
You had to mess with me.

560
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:55,180
You didn't care that it might mean the end of your career,

561
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,140
didn't care what happened to Shaun, dragged him along.

562
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,210
Unforgivable.

563
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,750
Your day's over.

564
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,130
And I'm making that call to Denver.

565
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,300
The reason we're here right now is because of Shaun.

566
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,760
Not me.

567
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,600
Shaun believed there was something wrong with the patient.

568
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,770
Shaun communicated with him, connected with him,

569
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,980
got him to come in.

570
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,830
And whether he's right or not, I couldn't be prouder to back him

571
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,170
because he sticks to his gut

572
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,940
and he fights for what he thinks is right.

573
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,300
Excuse me, please.

574
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,490
I have something to say, too.

575
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,790
Edward has a right parietal brain tumor.

576
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,390
Find Dr. Lim. You can have O.R. number 2.

577
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,210
There she goes. What's left?

578
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,090
Replace the damaged segment of aorta with the graft,

579
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,090
then plug the donor heart into the aortic stump.

580
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:15,870
Exactly. 3-0 prolene.

581
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,170
Damn. Give me a pledget.

582
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,590
The aorta wall is too thin.

583
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,470
It's like sewing tissue paper.

584
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,470
I can't anchor the graft here.

585
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,380
We're going to replace the whole ascending aorta.

586
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,780
Not just a segment.

587
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,200
We're building an entirely new aorta out of Teflon.

588
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,880
You'll be plugging the heart directly into the graft.

589
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,870
That's even riskier.

590
00:30:58,970 --> 00:30:59,790
That's true.

591
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,250
Get me three Teflon grafts and some monofilament sutures.

592
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,390
Now we just have to wait to see who wakes up...

593
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,850
Edward or Harry.

594
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,360
Flush it.

595
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,510
No leaks. Put your back into it, Park.

596
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,700
This needs to hold a systolic pressure of 180.

597
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,370
Good.

598
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,420
Okay.

599
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,010
Let's plug the donor heart in, see if this thing holds.

600
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,450
They're connected.

601
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,990
Let's take her off bypass.

602
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,550
We have a heartbeat.

603
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,430
Two heartbeats.

604
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,990
Who wants to do the closing?

605
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,110
I'll do it.

606
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,820
The Teflon graft was my idea. I'd like to finish it.

607
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:25,070
What we've accomplishe tonight is the type of radical surgery

608
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,310
that we plan to do more of at this hospital.

609
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,850
I loved Dr. Glassman.

610
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,200
You loved Dr. Glassman.

611
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,940
We all loved Dr. Glassman.

612
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,710
But now is the time to build on his legacy.

613
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,920
Now is the time to take St. Bonaventure

614
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,240
to the forefront of the medical profession.

615
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,080
I'd like to introduce you

616
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,540
to Elliot Arnott, Melanie's son,

617
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,340
and the phenomenal surgeon who masterminded this surgery,

618
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,220
Dr. Neil Melendez.

619
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,860
He wouldn't take the medication.

620
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,050
He just became more erratic, more disruptive,

621
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,910
and eventually...

622
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,870
For Hannah's sake, I, um...

623
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,250
I had to ask him to leave.

624
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,830
I didn't have a choice.

625
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:36,090
You couldn't have known it was the wrong medication.

626
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,750
We were making him worse.

627
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,800
That's true.

628
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,970
He doesn't blame you.

629
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,680
That's kind of you to say, but...

630
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,060
I know he has a distrust of doctors, not of you.

631
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,190
Where am I?

632
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,940
You're in a hospital. You're okay.

633
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,070
Eddie?

634
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,870
Mary.

635
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,670
My lamb.

636
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,960
Daddy.

637
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,530
Shaun?

638
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,750
I meant what I said to Andrews.

639
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,040
He might never fully appreciate what you accomplished out there.

640
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,090
But I did.

641
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,800
I know.

642
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,980
Thank you, Shaun.

643
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,530
Thank you, Jared.

644
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,630
Do you have my book?

645
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:30,720
Yeah.

646
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,530
I said goodbye to Jared.

647
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,340
He has to go to Denver,

648
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,200
and I have to stay here with you.

649
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,660
No you don't, Shaun.

650
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,640
It's not up to Jared, it's not up to me,

651
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,800
it's not to anyone to tell you where to be.

652
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,430
I...

653
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,020
I've got a long journey ahead of me.

654
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:25,060
And in the end, I've got to take it alone.

655
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,780
Yes, I understand.

656
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,370
I'm going with you.

657
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,490
Jared.

658
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,090
I miss having you around as a colleague.

659
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,850
But...

660
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,100
I...

661
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,610
...also miss what we had together.

662
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,110
You know, I th... I think we made a mistake.

663
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,530
I made a mistake.

664
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,210
I'd like you to stay.

665
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,470
No.

666
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,400
It's hard saying goodbye.

667
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,610
Doesn't mean it's a mistake.

668
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,740
- Yeah. - I think you'll be okay.

669
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,830
I'll be okay.

670
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,640
I think one day, we're both going to be very happy.

671
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:20,000
