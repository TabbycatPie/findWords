00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,246
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,725
You got your name on the wall.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,410
Now, I want the respect
that comes with it.

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,602
- Meaning?
- I want one of Harvey's clients.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,570
My clients are my clients.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,808
And you don't get out of my office
in the next three seconds,

7
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,610
something is going
to happen between you and me.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,486
And I guarantee it won't end with you
keeping all of your teeth.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,444
Avery McKemon was the first client
I ever brought into the firm.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,050
They win. Like me.

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,091
They know Trevor isn't in the class.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,124
So, they know he couldn't
have been the one to steal the test.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,208
- I'm not going to expel your friend.
- Thank you, sir.

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,368
There's just one thing.
I'm going to call Harvard.

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,324
Believe me when I tell you,
you're never going there.

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,841
Remember this?
No, you don't.

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,610
Because you can't remember
something you never knew.

18
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,846
You can't fire me.

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,644
Why would I fire you
when I can break you?

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,924
You see, I'm going to bury you
under a mountain of shit so big,

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,208
you're going to be
begging me to take it off.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,923
DONNA: First of all,
give me that Manhattan

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,849
and go get yourself a drink
a man would order.

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,806
Come back here in fifteen minutes
and if I still remember who you are,

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,921
I'll be shocked.

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,006
Okay. So, why are we really here?

27
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,448
I mean, you didn't just bring me out
to talk about Khaleesi.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,245
I did. Paul Porter
says I look like her translator.

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,521
- He's a Throner?
- No.

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,484
He says I'm a less attractive version
of her translator.

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,291
Okay. You're just trying to get me to say
that you're hotter than her.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,890
- Am I?
- You're way hotter.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,002
She has that accent.

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,208
- Fair point.
- You know, look.

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,244
The reason that I brought you here

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,724
is to tell you that I know that
you told Louis that I got Katrina a job.

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,329
- Look, I...
- Relax, I'm not mad at you.

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,807
But I do remember you being
the person who told me

39
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,570
not to force things
that weren't meant to be.

40
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,604
Rachel. Just because a person
gives advice, doesn't mean

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,563
that they have to follow
that same advice.

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,968
That's one of the core principles
outlined in The Book of Donna.

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,607
Seriously, though, I didn't mean
to tell Louis. it just came out. I'm sorry.

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,524
Like I said, it's fine.

45
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,961
He actually ended up asking
if we could be friends again.

46
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,884
- And?
- And I told him that

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,129
things would never be the same
between us unless he forgave Mike.

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,685
And what'd he say?

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,968
He said he couldn't do it.

50
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,768
JESSICA: That's easy,
the jumper over Ehlo.

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,447
Wrong, the switch-hand lay-up
over Perkins and Green.

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,803
I'm surprised at you, Harvey.
The Ehlo jumper was a game winner.

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,561
The lay-up was a statement. "I can do
whatever I want. I own this league."

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,648
Are you talking about Jordan
or yourself now?

55
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,368
Is there a difference?

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,808
A big difference.
Which brings me to why I'm here.

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,883
You can't do whatever
you want, Harvey.

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,809
You want me to make things
right with Louis.

59
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,644
He made things right
between Jeff and me.

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,201
So, I'm supposed to kiss his ass forever
because of that?

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,690
- No, you're supposed to make peace.
- Jessica, I'm willing to make peace.

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,768
- But that's never going to happen.
- Why not?

63
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,962
Because Louis is never going
to forgive Mike.

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,365
Then figure out a way
to make him forgive Mike.

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,530
Donna, how many times have I told you?
I want you out front.

66
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,529
I'm the only associate
with a secretary.

67
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,483
It'd be nice if people
could see my secretary.

68
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,763
Well, then, maybe your next secretary
can figure out where to put this

69
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,729
without coming into your office.

70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,085
- You're kidding.
- Not kidding.

71
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,446
You didn't forge this?

72
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,489
I am a lot of things,
but I am not a monster.

73
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,523
I would do that to
neither Michael nor you.

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,841
Oh, so, he's Michael now.

75
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,167
Well, I'm Donna to him,
he's Michael to me.

76
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,244
Which is what I told
His Aimess when he called.

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,010
Wait a second.
You're not kidding.

78
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,606
He signed with me?
Well, technically, he signed with me.

79
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,769
Holy shit, Donna,
we have to celebrate tonight.

80
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,325
Oh, I'm gonna celebrate.

81
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,369
You, on the other hand,
are having drinks with Louis.

82
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,849
What? We've been over this.

83
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,645
Whenever Louis asks to have drinks
with me, the answer's always no.

84
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,764
Listen to the words that I'm saying.

85
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,127
You're getting drinks
with Louis tonight.

86
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,125
- Fairchild's retiring.
- Fairchild's dead.

87
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,685
That's almost as good
as the Jordan news.

88
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,650
- Huh. Not to Fairchild.
- Who gives a shit about Fairchild?

89
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,643
The real tragedy is I have
to get drinks with Louis.

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,280
Which is why I got you a secluded
restaurant with a table in the back

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,686
where no one will see you.

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,690
And you'll call a half an hour in
and say there's an emergency.

93
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,564
Already in place.
And if I can't get through,

94
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,887
then I'll just have the waiter
spill drinks all over Louis.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,525
- You can have that done?
- Oh, please.

96
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,847
I could have Louis held captive
in a Tibetan monastery if I wanted to.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,809
Yeah, I don't think you could really...

98
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,571
Now, get the hell out of your office.
I got work to do.

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,525
Hmm.

100
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,441
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where Jim O'Donnell's office is?

101
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,086
That depends. What do you know
about immigration law?

102
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,807
What, are we talking visas, or are you
trying to process a labor certification?

103
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,561
- You know about immigration law?
- Doesn't everybody?

104
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,843
Okay, tough guy. What do you think
about my strategy on this?

105
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,689
Hmm.

106
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,642
- I think it's a winner.
- Why is that?

107
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,643
Because everyone knows
Gonzalez v. State of Maryland

108
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,804
was a kick-ass precedent,
but your case is better.

109
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,371
It was a kick-ass precedent,

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,209
but I'm not sure
that my case is better.

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,522
- Oh, it is.
- Well, what about Viteri v...

112
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,486
Trust me, it's better. Viteri needed magic
dust and a sympathetic judge to win.

113
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,240
- Have we met?
- No. But I'm Mike, by the way.

114
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,047
Claire.

115
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,042
Are you sure?
Because you look very familiar.

116
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,242
Oh, that's probably because I've been
delivering packages to your office

117
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,761
for the last two months but
you haven't given me the time of day

118
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,009
because you didn't think
I was smart enough for you.

119
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,730
- It's 9:15.
- Wait, that worked?

120
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,490
It's working so far,
but I'm going to need to know

121
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,965
your full story if it's going
to keep working.

122
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,162
I'll tell you the full story once
you give me your phone number.

123
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,647
I'll give you my phone number
when I know the full story.

124
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
How about this? I'll tell you
everything you want to know

125
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,366
at dinner tomorrow night.

126
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,248
In that case, I'll show you
where Jim O'Donnell's office is.

127
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,643
Jim O'Donnell's office?
Where do you think I just came from?

128
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,925
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

129
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,486
I need you do something for me.

130
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,325
- Okay. What is it?
- Never mind what it is.

131
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,091
Unless you want to go back to whatever
you were doing before I hired you,

132
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,725
you'll be here at 9 a.m.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,810
- This is the address for your car club.
- Oh, yeah, your memory.

134
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,888
I'd remember this even
if I had your memory.

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,843
It was right before
our first case together.

136
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,325
You're right. McKemon Motors.

137
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,450
So, this time, be on time
and put your seat belt on.

138
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,331
Because we're about
to take a trip down memory lane.

139
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,763
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

140
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,009
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

141
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,448
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

142
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,848
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

143
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,930
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

144
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,487
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

145
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,086
All right!

146
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,683
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

147
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,924
The greenback boogie

148
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,649
HARVEY: Morning, sunshine.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,207
- What are you...
- I think you call it a "prunie"?

150
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,889
Congratulations. Donna
told you my favorite breakfast drink.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,128
But what does that have
to do with the price of tea in Antarctica?

152
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,686
Donna also told me
that you were pissed because

153
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,371
you found out I gave you
a client I didn't want in the first place.

154
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,329
Hmm. And you think this
is going to make up for that?

155
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,723
No, but I think giving you
50% of McKemon Motors will.

156
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,961
What's the catch?

157
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,050
The catch is you and I are
about to take a road trip

158
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,681
to their corporate
headquarters right now.

159
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,886
- You serious?
- I don't joke about McKemon Motors,

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,809
and you know that as well as I do.

161
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,082
- To Fairchild.
- To Fairchild. God rest his soul.

162
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,610
Screw his soul. You know how they say
heaven just got another angel?

163
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,882
They ain't saying it now. (LAUGHING)

164
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,410
Why do you keep checking your phone?

165
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,807
- No reason, I just...
- Please, I'm not an idiot.

166
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,968
We've been here 28 minutes and in two
minutes, Donna's going to call

167
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,241
with some preplanned emergency.

168
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,249
- Louis, that's not...
- Harvey, look.

169
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,964
Why do you think I used
Fairchild's retirement

170
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,002
to get you to have drinks with me?

171
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,810
Because you knew I thought
it would never happen.

172
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,843
Because he doesn't have
an heir apparent.

173
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,089
Louis, if you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

174
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,407
Hardman's not going
to make one of us senior partner.

175
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,809
I'm not talking about one of us.
I'm talking about the both of us

176
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,843
convincing Hardman that
two kick-ass junior partners

177
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,645
are worth as much
as one new senior partner.

178
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,403
Louis, that is the best idea
you've had since I've known you.

179
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,729
Yeah. Here's another one.

180
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,686
When did you come up
with this one?

181
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,928
When you were in the bathroom
wasting seven minutes of our half hour.

182
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,804
(CHUCKLES)
(PHONE VIBRATING)

183
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,206
You have to get that?

184
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,129
No, I don't.
Let's drink to this.

185
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,687
Asshole.

186
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,091
That was Donna, wasn't it?

187
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,929
- Yeah, Trevor, this is so stupid.
- It's not stupid, dickhead.

188
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,321
I want you to see it for the first time
from the middle of the room.

189
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,011
It's your apartment, ass-face.

190
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,327
And don't even think
about giving me a wet willie.

191
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,885
You suck the fun out
of everything.

192
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,248
- Go ahead. Open your eyes, dick-foot.
- Dick-foot?

193
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,124
I was going to say ass-face.
It's all I could think of.

194
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,605
How do you even manage
in the world?

195
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,489
Are you just going to stand there
with your eyes closed

196
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,442
and mock my dick-foot?

197
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,921
I'm definitely not going to open them
to see your dick-foot.

198
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,850
That's a good point. I wouldn't do that
either. Go ahead. Open your eyes.

199
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,926
Wow. Holy shit.

200
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,884
- I thought you were getting a studio.
- Yeah, I was going to,

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,685
but then I realized we can't
both live in a studio.

202
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,930
- What?
- Welcome to Casa Evans and Ross.

203
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,124
- Trevor, I can't afford half this rent.
- That's the best part.

204
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,727
Don't worry about it.
I'm going to pay for your whole first year.

205
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,490
No, you're not.
I can't let you do that.

206
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,802
Michael,
I start my new job on Tuesday.

207
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,247
On top of that, I have my friends
and family business on the side.

208
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,647
Are you... That doesn't mean
I'm going to take charity from you.

209
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,168
Look, are you going to make me say it?
It's not charity.

210
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,887
I graduated and you didn't because
you took the fall for something I did.

211
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,566
I owe you.

212
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,087
Ugh!

213
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,125
Okay, I'll think about it.

214
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,931
All right.
In the meantime, think about this.

215
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,725
Uh, no. I can't.
I've got a date tonight.

216
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,049
All right, wow.
Clubfoot? Mustache? All of the above?

217
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,960
First dick-foot, and then clubfoot.

218
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,963
Are words with "foot"
all you've got now?

219
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,169
All right, smart guy, describe her
with one of your SAT words.

220
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,962
- Bigfoot.
- That's what I'm talking about.

221
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,202
- For the record, she's really hot.
- Mmm-hmm.

222
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,843
Let me get this straight.
Instead of promoting an existing partner,

223
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,361
you want me to make both
of you junior partners.

224
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,323
Well, not make us.
We've earned it.

225
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,240
Earned partnership status?

226
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,840
That's a pretty bold statement
coming from two fifth-years.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,843
Not just any fifth years.
I mean, we're the best

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,843
fifth years this firm has
ever seen, and you know it.

229
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,683
May I inquire whose idea this was?

230
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,331
- It was both of ours.
- It was Louie's.

231
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,807
That's generous of you
to give him credit.

232
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,526
It was generous of him
to come to me with the idea.

233
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,530
The truth is, I wasn't going
to make anyone partner.

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,367
But I do admire your gumption.

235
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,088
So, here's what I'm willing to do.
I will advance one of you

236
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,488
if you prove to me
which one it should be.

237
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,841
Oh, no, see, that's the whole point.
We came in as a package deal.

238
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,442
You came in with a proposal.
I'm giving you a counter,

239
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,125
and it's take it or leave it.

240
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,242
What sort of proof
are we talking about?

241
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,328
Let's just say McKemon Motors
is in play and landing them

242
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,130
could go a long way
to making your case.

243
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,480
No way. We're not going...

244
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,161
All right, Daniel.
You want McKemon?

245
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,288
I'll get you McKemon.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,844
LOUIS: We're going to McKemon
Motors, not your senior prom.

247
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,769
Why can't we just take
the car service?

248
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,405
Because we're going
to an engine manufacturer.

249
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,006
We need to show up
with a bad-ass car.

250
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,411
How about this little
bad boy right here?

251
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,362
That's no good.

252
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,927
- Why the hell not?
- Because it's not just the two of us.

253
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,121
What do you mean?

254
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,361
You son of a bitch.
You said you and I are going up there.

255
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,402
You lied to me.

256
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,966
Because if I didn't, you would
have never agreed to come.

257
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,811
- There is no way I'm going.
- Yes, you are.

258
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,491
I don't care if I have to tie you
to the roof. By the time we get

259
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,171
to McKernon, you and Mike
are going to work your shit out.

260
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,608
I can't believe you did that.

261
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,725
- The plan was to present a united front.
- And we did and he didn't go for it.

262
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,888
- Then you stabbed me in the back?
- I didn't stab you in the back.

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,004
- I took what he gave us.
- He didn't give us anything, Harvey.

264
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,770
- He pitted us against each other.
- Louis,

265
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,684
we've been pitted against
each other since day one.

266
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,881
What are you talking about?

267
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,082
How many of the 50 associates
we started with

268
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,009
do you think
are going to make partner?

269
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,487
I don't give a shit
about the other associates.

270
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,443
We toasted to making
partner together.

271
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,046
I don't make the rules, Louis.
Hardman does.

272
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,889
And as much as we say
he's an asshole,

273
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,641
I respect him for at least
telling us the deal out loud.

274
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,206
You want something out loud,
I'm gonna give you something out loud.

275
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,642
No way on earth am I going to let you
land McKemon Motors.

276
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,811
Nowhere to run to, baby

277
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,080
Nowhere to hide

278
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,761
Got nowhere to run to, baby

279
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,250
Nowhere to hide

280
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,329
- Hey, what the hell?
- What the hell what?

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,091
This isn't a joy ride, Louis.
You don't want to talk,

282
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,441
you're going to sit in silence
until you're ready to talk.

283
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,130
Well, you can make me sit
in silence all you want,

284
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,969
but you can't make me
work it out with him.

285
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,570
- Then, what can, Louis?
- Excuse me?

286
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,284
You worked it out with Donna.

287
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,971
And Rachel.
You lied to Malone for Jessica.

288
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,009
What's it going to take
to work it out with me?

289
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,685
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I forgave those people

290
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,327
because they were victims infected
with the disease known as Mike Ross.

291
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,086
And now, I'm stuck in the car
with patient zero.

292
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,965
Okay, Outbreak. Patient zero
is the first person

293
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,163
actually infected with the disease,
not the disease itself.

294
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,204
And for your information,
I'm stuck in the same car as you.

295
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,244
At least you don't have to look

296
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,886
at the back of your own stupid, fat,
balding head.

297
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,129
- What's so goddamn funny?
- You two are finally talking.

298
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,083
I think you earned a little music.

299
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,407
I know you're no good for me

300
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,406
But free of you,
I'll never be, no

301
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,361
- That's it?
- Yeah.

302
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,323
All you have to do
is pick one of two characters.

303
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,240
And whichever character I don't pick
is removed from film history forever.

304
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,886
- It's like they never existed.
- It's a piece of cake.

305
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,566
Okay, Han Solo or Indiana Jones.

306
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,244
- I'm out.
- What's the problem?

307
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,566
You just said it was going
to be a piece of cake.

308
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,842
The problem is you just picked the two
greatest characters of all time.

309
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,206
- You're right about that. I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

310
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,129
Let me start with something
easier for you.

311
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,766
- Butch or Sundance.
- Mmm. Check, please?

312
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,769
(GIGGLING)
Yeah, we're done.

313
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,847
No.

314
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,441
This is really nice.

315
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,685
Yeah, I'm having a really good time, too.

316
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,804
So, when do I get to hear
the answer to what you do

317
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,083
- besides being a bike messenger?
- Who says I do anything?

318
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,084
Look, Mike, there's nothing wrong
with being a bike messenger.

319
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,084
But I'm serious about my life.

320
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,090
I'm not going to law school just to
cash out. I really want to help people.

321
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,851
Like, bike messengers
don't help people?

322
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,646
No, not in the way that a man I want
to be in a relationship with does.

323
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,925
Well, then, today is your lucky day.

324
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,929
I knew it. Where do you go?

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,730
Mmm-mmm. You first.
Where do you go?

326
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,803
- NYU.
- Columbia.

327
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,887
- I win.
- I win.

328
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,882
(mum-nus)

329
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,451
- Good morning, Jessica.
- Daniel. I still haven't received...

330
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,006
This year's budget. I was just
on my way to give it to you.

331
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,851
And I thought you hadn't gotten around
to it because you were too busy

332
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,804
- pitting Harvey against Louis.
- You disapprove.

333
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,366
I don't mind a little
healthy competition.

334
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,767
But I do mind the empty promise
of partnership.

335
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,684
What makes you so sure
there's no reward at the end?

336
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,167
The last time we discussed this,
you said Harvey wasn't ready.

337
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,361
And you said Louis wasn't.

338
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,448
Well, I'm giving them both
the chance to prove it.

339
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,882
- So, partnership is on the table.
- Partnership was already on the table.

340
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,807
What makes you so sure
it's going to be Harvey?

341
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,844
Because Harvey will do
whatever it takes to win.

342
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,931
If doing whatever it takes is the criteria,
my money is on Louis.

343
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,088
What are you talking about?

344
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,931
I think we should continue
this conversation in my office.

345
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,650
(MIKE CLEARING THROAT)

346
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,761
Hi, I got a delivery
for a Zoltan Freastmeisterson.

347
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,727
I'm afraid there's no one
in this office with that name.

348
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,366
- I'm afraid you're mistaken.
- Really?

349
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,000
Because I'm willing to bet that there's
no one on this planet with that name.

350
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,488
Okay. Fine. If you could just point me
towards Kumquat McGillicuddy's office,

351
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,843
I'll be on my way. Because I certainly
did not bike down here

352
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,608
with two fictitious deliveries just to tell
you what a great time I had last night.

353
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,326
Good, because I have
a lot of work to do.

354
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,841
So, if you could please just hop on
that little bike of yours and...

355
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,086
- NATHAN: Claire?
- Yeah.

356
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,568
When you're finished flirting
with Quicksilver here,

357
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,763
you might want to get down to I.N.S.
Hector Suarez just got taken in.

358
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,850
Shit. His visa's expired.
They're going to send him back

359
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,850
- to the Dominican Republic.
- Wait. Um, maybe I can help.

360
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,611
- No offense. I don't know how you can...
- No, no, Nathan,

361
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,563
he's not just a bike messenger.
He's in law school.

362
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,210
- Really? Where are you in law school?
- Uh, Columbia.

363
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,368
And he happens to know visas
better than either one of us.

364
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,843
- Well, I really can't pay you, so.
- Um, I don't need any money.

365
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,362
- I just want to help.
- All right, Columbia, be my guest.

366
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,767
We've got a hearing
Tuesday morning, 9 a.m.

367
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,411
Mike, that is amazing.
Thank you.

368
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,325
Oh, no. Don't thank me yet.
I haven't even done anything...

369
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,608
Um, this might not be relevant, but

370
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,964
I actually saved Kumquat McGillicuddy's
life this morning. So...

371
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,730
I'm gonna go do some work.

372
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,291
CLAIRE: Thank you.

373
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,360
- Mr. McKemon.
- Harvey Specter.

374
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,682
Mr. Specter, would you mind telling me
why I have two different

375
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,763
Pearson-Hardman lawyers
on my schedule today?

376
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,531
I don't know, but after this,
you won't need to meet the other one.

377
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,762
- You're cocky.
- I'm right.

378
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,441
You're also traveling a little light.
Where's your PowerPoint presentation?

379
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,769
- I don't need a PowerPoint presentation.
- Why is that?

380
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,531
Because every lawyer in the city
has tried to dazzle you,

381
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,802
and you're still looking
for a date to the big dance.

382
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,042
Because they don't know
what you're looking for.

383
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,446
What exactly am I looking for?

384
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,966
Loyal'!!-

385
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,287
You're right.

386
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,841
I built this company
from the ground up.

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,128
And everybody that started with me
is still here.

388
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,127
And I know why.

389
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,687
You don't downsize in the bad times,
they stick with you in the good times.

390
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,281
And no other lawyer
has figured that out.

391
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,481
Not a single one.

392
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,729
Well, I'm the one, Avery.
Which is why I know you don't want me

393
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,889
dumping you for a bigger
client down the line.

394
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,725
How do I know you won't do that?

395
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,802
Because that's not the way I work.

396
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,050
Well, it's a hell of a nice sentiment. But
how do I know you're not full of shit?

397
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,926
I'm glad you asked.

398
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,410
Because here's my
PowerPoint presentation.

399
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,683
Okay-

400
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,764
I have a hearing tomorrow
against Fletcher Engines.

401
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,847
You win that, you're my lawyer.

402
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,849
LOUIS: Okay, just don't change lanes.
Don't change lanes.

403
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,803
Don't do it! Great, you know what...

404
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,681
This is ridiculous.
You drive like a savage animal.

405
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,848
- Louis, be a man and suck it up.
- Suck it up?

406
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,041
I'm sitting in the death seat.

407
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,402
Fine, I'll pull over and you can sit
in the back with Mike.

408
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,443
Okay. I'm not sitting
in the back with a fraud.

409
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,211
And before you even think of it,
you're not putting him

410
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,891
- up here and sticking me back there.
- Then, what do you want, Louis?

411
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,850
Because there is no way in hell I'm
letting you behind the wheel of this car.

412
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,281
It's crystal goddamn clear.

413
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,209
You and I sit in the back
and he chauffeurs the both of us.

414
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,681
Whoa. No. Even if Harvey
would agree to that...

415
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,320
Shut the hell up. You're not talking,
you don't get to refuse.

416
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,643
I'm not refusing, Louis.
I don't know how to drive.

417
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,281
Holy shit.

418
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,047
- You wanted to see me?
- Uh, yes.

419
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,924
I heard you did well
with Avery McKemon.

420
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,724
Well, then, you heard wrong.

421
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,320
Because I killed it with Avery McKemon.

422
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,809
- Congratulations, Harvey.
- Thank you, Daniel.

423
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,809
You're welcome.

424
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,129
Unfortunately, we can't represent
McKernon Motors after all.

425
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,691
Why not?

426
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,485
Well, it turns out Fletcher Engines
wants to sign with us.

427
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,967
Because they found out
I'm about to land McKemon.

428
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,402
Yes. And they're three times
the size of McKemon Motors.

429
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,966
Well, I don't care how big they are.
I'm not dropping my client.

430
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,527
Yes, you are.

431
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,090
- This was your plan all along.
- Of course it was.

432
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,329
- It's how the world works.
- I don't give a shit how the world works.

433
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,926
- I gave my word to Avery McKemon.
- Watch yourself, Harvey.

434
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,884
I haven't gotten where I am
by watching myself, Daniel.

435
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,731
And I don't appreciate being
used as a stalking horse.

436
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,361
Well, you may not appreciate it,

437
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,086
but let me remind you,
you work for me.

438
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,850
And I'm giving you the chance
to show me you understand that.

439
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,804
Let me remind you, you said
partnership was on the table.

440
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,804
I'm going to hold you to that,
and so will Jessica.

441
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,806
Hey, fart taster. I thought
you were coming over.

442
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,764
What, nothing? It's a classic.
I'm implying your job

443
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,767
is to literally taste...

444
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,120
Hey, Trevor, I'm
in the middle of something

445
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,925
- so I'll come over later. Okay?
- In the middle of what?

446
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,081
That girl I told you about,
she, uh, she interns at a legal clinic

447
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,449
- and I am, uh, helping her with a case.
- Dick-foot gave you homework?

448
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,848
Okay. First of all, from now on,
her name is Claire.

449
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,520
And second of all,
this is important, so...

450
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,769
Dude, what the hell
are you talking about?

451
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,084
I might have told her
that I'm in law school.

452
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,202
(CHUCKLES)
Holy shit.

453
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,170
- You will do anything to get laid.
- I'm not trying to get laid.

454
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,760
I really like this girl,
and I have zero chance

455
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,922
with her if all I am
is a bike messenger.

456
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,644
Yeah, well, you're definitely
going to have no chance

457
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,966
if she finds out
that you lied to her.

458
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,766
Trevor, I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

459
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,565
You don't really want
to talk about anything anymore.

460
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,447
- It's about the apartment, isn't it?
- Yes, it's about the apartment.

461
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,886
Okay, you want the truth?

462
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,446
I haven't given you an answer
because of Grammy.

463
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,686
You think I didn't know that?

464
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,285
Then, you also know
she's never forgiven you

465
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,401
for what happened in college,

466
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,887
and she is never ever going
to let me to live with you.

467
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,891
Then, explain to her that this is my way
of making up for what I did in college.

468
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,765
- That is never gonna work.
- You know what, Michael?

469
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,884
If you're going to do all of this
for some girl you just met,

470
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,004
maybe it's time you stood up
to Grammy for me.

471
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,931
How did it go against Fletcher Engines?

472
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,042
You cut 'em off at the knees
or put 'em in the ground?

473
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,525
They put me in the ground.

474
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,484
And on top of that, it was
in front of Avery McKemon.

475
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,683
- You lost in court?
- I didn't just lose, I looked like a fool.

476
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,521
Harvey, what happened?

477
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,085
The general counsel for Fletcher Engines

478
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,601
knew every move I was going
to make before I even made it.

479
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,562
How could he?

480
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,762
Because Hardman
must have tipped him off.

481
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,082
- You really think he would do that?
- I wouldn't have yesterday,

482
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,167
but I sure as hell do today.

483
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,329
- Well, then, you have to go to Jessica.
- And say what?

484
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,011
Hardman's Managing Partner.
She's not.

485
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,248
I don't have any proof, and I never will.

486
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,930
- Well, then, what are you going to do?
- I don't know,

487
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,011
but I have less than 14 hours to dig
through 1,000 pages of patent law.

488
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,645
Ugh!

489
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,889
If only there was somebody in the office
who was an expert on patent law.

490
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,083
Donna, I am not going to Louis.
He'll never help me.

491
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,167
Well, that's too bad.

492
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,005
Because if you can't figure out
how to patch things up with Louis,

493
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,203
then you don't deserve
Avery McKemon or that partnership.

494
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,009
What's all this?

495
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,206
Um.

496
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,529
A grandson can't order in
and set a table for his grandmother?

497
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,605
A grandson can do whatever he wants,
but the answer to your question is no.

498
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,081
- You haven't even heard what it is yet.
- I know what it is,

499
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,170
because I've been waiting for it
since that kid graduated.

500
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,647
And you are not going
to live with him.

501
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,923
That boy is the reason
you got kicked out of school.

502
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,566
You're the one that told me
to tell the Dean the truth.

503
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,331
Well, that was before I knew
it would cost you graduating.

504
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,930
And he's trying to make it up to me.

505
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,202
He's going to pay for
my whole first year's rent.

506
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,450
That will not make up for putting
your whole life into a tailspin.

507
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,728
- It's a head start.
- No, it's not a head start.

508
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,968
That boy is going to drag
you back down with him.

509
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,923
Grammy, I'm never going
to let that happen!

510
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,326
Goddamn it, I forbid it!

511
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,730
I'm sorry, Michael. I lost my temper.

512
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,882
But I, I know what he does to you
and I know he'll always be the same.

513
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,321
Has it occurred to you
that maybe I'm not the same?

514
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,605
What's changed?

515
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,480
I met someone.

516
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,130
I'm going to figure out a way
to finish school and,

517
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,362
and then, I'm going
to go to law school.

518
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,407
Good. Then do it from here.

519
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,050
What's on your mind, Mike?
You look lost in thought.

520
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,328
I was just thinking
about my grandmother.

521
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,726
We took a train trip to D.C. once.

522
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,929
(SIGHS) We played "I Spy."

523
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,246
That's a nice story, Mike,
but we are not playing "I Spy."

524
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,806
I'll play. It will remind me
of dominating Esther

525
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,644
on our trips to see
our smelly Aunt Frida.

526
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,401
All right, if it will get you
and Mike talking. Sure.

527
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,569
I spy a fraud. Probably never
even knew his grandmother.

528
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,806
All right, goddamn it. You got a problem
with me, take it up with me.

529
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,325
But don't ever talk about
my grandmother again.

530
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,441
Oh, I forgot.

531
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,211
The poor orphan from New York City
who I should feel sorry for

532
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,049
- because he never learned to drive.
- I'm telling you,

533
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,049
- watch yourself.
- Why, because I hurt your feelings?

534
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,002
- Louis!
- I don't care.

535
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,087
For all I know, you're probably
not even an orphan.

536
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,042
Louis.

537
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,970
It sure as hell wouldn't be the first time
a con man tried to make that claim.

538
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,201
- That's enough.
- No, it isn't.

539
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,368
Yes, it is.
Pull the car over right now.

540
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,409
I'm going to beat the shit out of him.

541
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,210
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Oh, wait. Let me just turn my back

542
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,051
- so I can give you the right angle to...
- You were right.

543
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,122
We should've stuck together.

544
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,080
I get it. You need my help

545
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,726
because you got your ass
wiped in court this morning.

546
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,810
You're right. I did get
my ass kicked this morning,

547
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,486
- but it wasn't a fair fight.
- What are you talking about?

548
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,764
Hardman accessed my computer
and fed the other side my game plan.

549
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,250
Okay, I'm still waiting for the part
where I'm supposed to give a shit.

550
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,091
Hardman did it because I refused
to dump McKernon for Fletcher

551
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,043
after I gave him my word.

552
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,447
And why should I help you when
you couldn't live up to your word to me?

553
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,688
I did live up to my word.
We went to Daniel.

554
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,041
- Oh, bullshit.
- No, it's not bullshit.

555
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,282
I welcomed your idea with open arms.

556
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,210
And by the way, when he asked
whose idea it was, I gave you the credit.

557
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,011
You see, Harvey,
that's the part you will never understand.

558
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,642
I didn't want the credit.
I wanted us to be a team.

559
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,246
- Then let's be a team right now.
- You don't want to be a team.

560
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,091
You want me to help you get McKemon
so you can make partner.

561
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,124
I want you to help me so I can keep
my word to Avery McKemon.

562
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,528
And when I become partner,
I'll keep my word to you.

563
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,924
What the hell word is that?

564
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,204
That someday, what you wrote on that
napkin goes up on the goddamn wall.

565
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,929
You seem to have done
a lot of work here, Mike.

566
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,646
- Oh, it's no big deal.
- It is a big deal.

567
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,525
Mike found a loophole
in the Immigration Act of 1975,

568
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,450
- and it's going to blow you away.
- I don't know about that.

569
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,801
But it may help Hector Suarez
stay in the country.

570
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,208
That's great. And you're more
than welcome to, uh, stay and watch.

571
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,848
Unfortunately, Claire,
I need you to run back to the office.

572
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,288
Marshall called in sick, and I need
someone to handle the walk-ins, so...

573
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,768
Okay-

574
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,968
- Call me. Tell me how it goes.
- Yeah.

575
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,249
(DOOR CLOSING)

576
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,211
What the hell are you doing? That's...

577
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,163
Going to keep Hector Suarez
in the country?

578
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,282
Yeah.

579
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,289
Yeah, nothing's going
to keep him in the country.

580
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,244
So, what I'm going to do
is buy him some time

581
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,686
so he can get his affairs in order

582
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,683
and then I'm going to
give his children a chance to stay.

583
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,171
(SCOFFS)
I'm just...

584
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,642
I'm sorry. Are you jealous
of me and Claire, or...

585
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,485
NATHAN: Hey, look, I'm not jealous.
And I was waiting for her to leave

586
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,604
- to save you the embarrassment.
- Embarrassment of what?

587
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,286
- That's good work.
- I'm not talking about the work.

588
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,808
I'm talking about
your bike messenger by day,

589
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,689
law student by night bullshit.

590
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,245
All right, you don't know
what you're talking about.

591
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,647
Well, what are you going to tell me next?
Your roommate is a stripper

592
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,683
who's in medical school?

593
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,010
Tell me right now.
I call Columbia, your story holds up.

594
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,687
That's what I thought.

595
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,842
Forget who I am and take
a look at that folder.

596
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,803
- This is a man's life.
- Don't touch me.

597
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,050
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stay the hell away from Claire.

598
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,606
HARVEY: Daniel.

599
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,687
Did you know that some of these species
can live up to 200 years?

600
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,686
Fascinating. Did you know Fletcher
Engines is picking up the pieces?

601
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,930
- I guess congratulations are in order.
- I'm not here for a pat on the back.

602
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,769
I'm here to tell you,
you're making me partner.

603
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,209
Partner?

604
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,244
I never said signing McKernon
was the key to making partner.

605
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,649
All I said was landing them could go
a long way toward making your case.

606
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,401
Bullshit. You said partnership
was on the table.

607
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,081
And I said I was going to hold you to it.
And I'm going to right now.

608
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,327
You don't hold me to anything.

609
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,243
But I did say partnership
was on the table. And it is.

610
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,727
Just not for you.

611
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,170
What are you talking about?

612
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,169
Well, I can't very well
make you partner after I just

613
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,805
told Louis I'm making him partner.

614
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,044
What?

615
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,289
You don't get it, do you?

616
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,641
This isn't about bringing in business.

617
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,001
This is about figuring out
who would do whatever it takes.

618
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,363
- I did whatever it took.
- You didn't do a thing.

619
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,727
You had the chance
to triple our business

620
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,811
- and all you had to do was take a knee.
- You mean bend a knee.

621
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,043
Yes. That's exactly what I mean.

622
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,125
But you're an arrogant little boy
who would rather win than get in line.

623
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,444
Well, what the hell did Louis
do to get in line?

624
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,967
He did whatever it took.

625
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,011
Please get away from me.
Nathan told me everything.

626
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,321
Wait, please.
Let me explain, okay?

627
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,642
No. Explain what?
That you're a sociopath?

628
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,001
I'm not a sociopath. I'm the same guy
that you hit it off with.

629
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,201
No, you're not. You lied to me.

630
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,084
Yes, I am. And I didn't mean
to lie to you, okay?

631
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,771
- I was going to tell you the truth.
- Then, why didn't you?

632
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,407
Because you said you wanted to be
with a guy who was doing something

633
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,444
- good with his life, and I wasn't.
- So, what?

634
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,324
Now, you're here to tell me
that all of a sudden,

635
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,124
you want to dedicate your life
to helping people

636
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,527
- or some other lie like that?
- It's not a lie.

637
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,529
And what I did would have
helped Hector Suarez.

638
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,484
- Yeah, but you only did it...
- Claire, please, you have to believe me.

639
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,206
After I met you, I decided
to get my shit together.

640
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,288
I am trying to get my shit together.

641
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,448
Okay, Mike. You know
what I hate more than guys

642
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,130
who don't have their shit together?

643
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,170
It's guys who lie about
getting their shit together.

644
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,050
Claire.

645
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,331
Louis, fill up the tank.
I'll be back.

646
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,845
Well?

647
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,402
Well, what?

648
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,568
You heard what he said.
Fill up the tank.

649
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,480
Yeah, I did hear what he said.
He said, "Louis, fill up the tank."

650
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,364
Well, where I come from,
it's people who didn't go to college

651
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,766
who fill up gas tanks.

652
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,087
Yeah. And where I come from,
if you take another step...

653
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,725
Oh, the tough kid from the city
is gonna beat my ass?

654
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,251
Louis, I'm telling you right now.

655
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,084
You ruined my life.
You ruined my firm.

656
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,040
Louis!

657
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,922
(CHOKING)

658
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,009
(COUGHING)

659
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,008
(SOBBING)

660
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,889
- HARVEY: You son of a bitch.
- Wait, Harvey.

661
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,326
Tell me right now you weren't the one

662
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,124
that gave Fletcher Engines
my game plan.

663
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,523
Hardman told me he wasn't going
to make you partner, anyway.

664
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,210
And once he offered it to me,
all I had to do was...

665
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,646
Sell me out.

666
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,088
How is what I did any different than

667
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,368
you going after McKemon Motors
in the first place?

668
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,370
If you don't understand that
on your own, you never will.

669
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,769
So, from now on, you stay on your side
of the yard, I'll stay on mine.

670
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,690
No, Harvey, listen to me.

671
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,882
You told me you would fight
to get our names on the wall

672
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,367
once you got on the other side.
I can do the same for you.

673
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,644
Did you hear what I just said?
I don't want you doing shit for me.

674
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,606
Oh, so, it would have been okay
if you were the one who got there first?

675
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,684
It would have been okay if you'd gotten
there first fair and square.

676
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,407
Because then I would have believed you
when you said you wanted to be a team.

677
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,325
I do want to be a team, Harvey.
That's why I helped you after.

678
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,050
No, you don't!

679
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,763
You don't want to be a team.
You just want to have it both ways,

680
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,929
because you're a disloyal rat. You always
have been and you always will,

681
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,764
no matter what it says on your door.

682
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,886
Well, like you said, we've been pitted
against each other since day one.

683
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,766
You asked me how many
of the 50 associates we started with

684
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,086
would make partner.

685
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,882
Well, you know what?
I don't give a shit about the other 49,

686
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,565
because I'm the one who did.

687
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,769
I'm the one who did.

688
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,006
And now, you get the hell out of my face
because I have work to do.

689
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,527
You know he did that on purpose, right?

690
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,846
Did what on purpose?

691
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,846
He asked you to fill the tank
because he knew what you'd do.

692
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,045
Knew what I would do?
What about what you would do?

693
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,450
He knew that, too.

694
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,405
- Louis.
- You never even said you were sorry.

695
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,768
I am sorry, Louis.

696
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,330
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

697
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,971
I'm not a con man, Louis.

698
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,087
Every single other thing
I ever told you was true.

699
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,327
You want to know something
that I've never even admitted to myself?

700
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,326
I never learned to drive for the same
reason I never went to law school.

701
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,202
Both my parents were
killed in a car accident and

702
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,926
ever since then, I've never been able to...

703
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,451
Get behind the wheel.

704
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,170
And then Harvey gave me
a license and I took it.

705
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,523
You were 11 years old.

706
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,726
I mean, you must have felt so alone.

707
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,084
I thought you said you didn't believe
I was an orphan.

708
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,449
I looked it up.

709
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,970
I had to once I found out that
you never went to law school.

710
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,447
You mean once you found out
that I'm a fraud.

711
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,165
You're not a fraud, Mike.

712
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,810
You just never went to law school.

713
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,407
Okay, Frazier, you get a grape.

714
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,801
Ali, I got you a fruit punch.

715
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,649
You two work your shit out?

716
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,927
I'll take that as a yes.
Let's get the hell out of here.

717
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,684
- I should never have lied to her.
- Oh, screw her, man.

718
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,881
If she doesn't like you for who you are,
she doesn't deserve you.

719
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,843
It's not Claire's fault.
It's mine.

720
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,726
I know you're into her
and everything, but trust me

721
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,410
there are plenty of other fish
in the sea.

722
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,322
You don't know that.

723
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,887
For all you know, I'm never going
to meet another girl like her again.

724
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,923
- (SIGHING) Michael.
- Okay. Trevor,

725
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,849
if I'm going to have to listen
to whatever you're about to say,

726
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,644
I'm going to need a joint first.

727
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,689
Come on. I thought you were trying
to turn your life around.

728
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,526
I'll turn my life around tomorrow.
But tonight, I'm a bike messenger, so...

729
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,404
- Dude?
- Trevor.

730
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,887
All right. Fine.

731
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,088
I know Grammy doesn't want
you living here,

732
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,248
but you can crash
here tonight if you want.

733
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,288
Donna!

734
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,764
Is something wrong?

735
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,691
Why would something be wrong?

736
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,646
Because I don't believe
you've ever been in my office before.

737
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,603
No, nothing's wrong.

738
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,608
And I know it's not my place,
but I'm here to tell you

739
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,762
that I think you're making a mistake.

740
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,248
Is this about me not giving
people off for Columbus Day?

741
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,890
You know this isn't about that.

742
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,287
Harvey laid it on the line with Daniel,
and you didn't have his back.

743
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,887
Donna, I've had Harvey's back
since the day I met him.

744
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,646
For your information, when I found out
what Daniel was up to,

745
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,485
I had him guarantee
partnership was on the table.

746
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,045
And then you let him
give it to the wrong man.

747
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,403
- That is on Harvey, not on me.
- What are you talking about?

748
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,846
Daniel was worried

749
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,567
that Harvey couldn't put the firm's
best interests ahead of his own,

750
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,364
and Harvey proved him right.

751
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,564
Or maybe you're just
telling yourself that

752
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,967
because you don't
want to stand up to Daniel Hardman.

753
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,127
Donna,

754
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,810
there's a reason why you are
where you are and I am where I am.

755
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,890
And that is because
one of us sees the bigger picture.

756
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,482
You knew about Fletcher Engines?

757
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,524
What I know is that
Harvey's time will come.

758
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,608
And if this little incident
gets him to think about

759
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,843
other people for a change,
then I'll take it.

760
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,849
You're up early.

761
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,531
I'm up early because
I couldn't sleep.

762
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,244
Where were you all night?

763
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,883
You know where I was.

764
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,722
I was staying at my new apartment.

765
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,845
- I thought we'd settled this.
- You settled it, I didn't.

766
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,331
(SIGHS)

767
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,367
- I'm telling you, that kid just...
- Grammy,

768
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,965
for as long as I can remember,

769
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,845
you've been calling him
that kid or that boy, or worse.

770
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,885
His name is Trevor,
and he's my best friend.

771
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,884
I'm going to do this thing
with or without your blessing.

772
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,963
But it sure would be nice to have it.

773
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,966
Okay, Michael.

774
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,691
I'm not going to lie to you
and pretend I approve. But...

775
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,851
You're a grown man
and I respect your decision.

776
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,966
- I love you, Grammy.
- I love you, too.

777
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,490
Thank you. I believe
that's all I need to know.

778
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,883
Thank you for your time, Ms. Pearson.
I will wait to hear from you.

779
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,046
Oh, one more thing.

780
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,289
Does your father know
you came to me to for a job?

781
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,926
- I, I...
- Did you really think

782
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,407
I didn't know you were
Robert Zane's daughter?

783
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,649
Is that why you're interviewing me?

784
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,810
Because if it is, I would like to remove
myself from consideration.

785
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,369
If you don't want to work for your father,
that's your business.

786
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,209
I'm hiring you because
I like what I see.

787
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,168
Hiring me?

788
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,926
You start Monday,
if that's not too much trouble.

789
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,724
I will be the first one in.

790
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,686
Aren't you going to ask me why I don't
want to work with my father?

791
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,083
I know why.
I have a dad just like yours.

792
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,487
- He has his own law firm?
- He's a surgeon.

793
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,090
But it's the same damn thing.

794
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,810
(SIGHS)

795
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,124
- How are we on time?
- We're perfect.

796
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,969
But I'm not going in there.
You two are.

797
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,286
What are you talking about?

798
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,883
I said I was giving you 50% of McKemon.
I didn't say I was keeping the other 50%.

799
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,686
Oh. So, you finally realized they need
an upgrade in representation.

800
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,485
Easy, Frazier. You'd still be out cold
at that gas station

801
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,920
if I hadn't saved your ass.

802
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,008
Okay, I would have
gotten out eventually.

803
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,326
Not from where I was standing.

804
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,522
I'm slippery. I told you,
I wrestled in high school.

805
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,409
- I checked on that, he did.
- See?

806
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,601
And now you're fighting for him?
Okay, I guess my job here is done.

807
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,246
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm taking the car back to the city.

808
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,647
Then what the hell
are we supposed to do?

809
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,809
Ray's waiting on the other
side of the parking lot, isn't he?

810
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,803
He'll drive you two back
when you're done.

811
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,964
Wait, you know what? I have a better
idea. How about you take Ray,

812
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,970
we take the car, and I teach Mike
how to drive on the way home?

813
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,287
- You'd actually do that?
- Yeah, I would.

814
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,243
- HARVEY: No way.
- You don't trust me?

815
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,806
I don't trust you as far as I can throw
you. You're a goddamn fraud.

816
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,127
- That's what I said.
- Harvey, seriously. Come on, I promise.

817
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,925
Okay, I know you will.
Louis, you make one dent in this car,

818
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,850
Mike's back on the street
and your name's off the door.

819
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,968
You think he was serious
about what he just said?

820
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,081
Come on.

821
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,368
LOUIS: Well, I'm just a little nervous
because I feel like I drank

822
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,289
that power drink and it has
a lot of sodium in it.

823
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,164
LOUIS: Actually,
it's like drinking a hot dog.

824
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,362
LOUIS: But, um, the doctor says
it raises my blood pressure.

825
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,404
MIKE: I'm gonna need you
to let me do the talking in there.
