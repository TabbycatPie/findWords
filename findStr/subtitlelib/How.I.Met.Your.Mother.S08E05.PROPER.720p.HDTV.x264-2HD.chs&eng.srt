00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:03,596
2030年<i>孩子们 咱都知道你们Barney叔就是个狗男人 (dog在俚语中指喜欢到处一夜情的男人)</i>
Kids, it's no secret your Uncle Barney is a bit of a dog,

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:06,263
<i>尽管他很爱我 但我一直觉得</i>
<i>and even though he loved me, I think he always wanted</i>

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:08,861
<i>他想找另一个狗男人作泡钮搭档</i>
<i>a wingman who was a bit of a dog, too.</i>

4
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,961
<i>在2012年的秋天</i>
<i>And in the fall of 2012...</i>

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,761
<i>他找到了</i>
<i>...he found one.</i>

6
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:22,661
肃然起敬
Respect.

7
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,061
肃然起敬
Respect

8
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:46,261
嘿 伙计们 昨晚很开心 谢谢你们

00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:48,361
我再说一次

00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,861
昨晚很开心
great night.

11
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:54,561
Ted 亲爱的 也没那么开心吧
Ted, honey, it was not a great night.

12
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:58,561
Ted 我和Lily昨晚注意到一些事
Ted, Lily and I noticed some things last night.

13
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:00,561
嘿 Ted 能帮我拿块饼乾吗
Hey, Ted, can you pass me a cracker?

14
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,061
我都为你逃婚了 你为我做这点事情总可以的吧
Yeah. It's the least you can do, considering I left a guy at the altar for you.

15
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:06,961
看这张嘴
Right, right?

16
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:10,761
拜托 那就是个玩笑话
Oh, come on, that was a joke.

17
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:14,911
过了30的女人 不拿婚姻大事开玩笑
Women over 30 don't joke when it comes to commitment.

18
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:17,861
Victoria希望我们能慢慢来
Victoria is happy we're taking things slow.

19
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:22,661
哦我的小宝贝 没有哪个32岁的女人
Oh, oh, honeysweetiebaby, no 32-year-old woman

20
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:25,100
会愿意慢慢来
is happy taking things slow.

21
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:30,461
相信我 Victoria的高中同学肯定 已经在脸书上贴了第二胎的照片
Trust me, Victoria has got friends from high school posting pictures of second babies on Facebook.

22
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:33,361
你以为她会"咱们就这么啪啪啪
And you think girlfriend's all like, "Oh, let's just bone a bunch

23
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:35,561
到明年我又老一岁还依旧未婚"吗
so I'm another year older and still single"?

24
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,884
贱人 你用用脑子
Bitch, please. Mm.

25
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:41,661
同志们 我有新哥们儿了
Guys, I've got a new bro-

26
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:44,561
一个足以让所有兄弟黯然失色的哥们
a bro that puts all other bros to shame.

27
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:46,661
小钮儿都喜欢他
The bitches love him.

28
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,961
他这一天都"精疲力尽"了 (字面意思:他这一天都在埋骨头)
He buries bones all day.

29
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:57,461
- 没人比他更会勾搭小钮了(字面:追尾巴) - 你们为什么不笑
No one chases tail like him. Why aren't you guys laughing?

30
00:01:57,461 --> 00:02:00,961
哦对 我应该先说这句 他是只狗
Oh, wait, I probably should have led with this: he's a dog.

31
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,261
我给他取名
I've named him

32
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:04,661
流浪兄弟
Brover.

33
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:06,260
我这就去...
I'll go...

34
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:07,761
接应他
...fetch him.

35
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,861
好吧 我挺担心Barney的
Okay, I'm worried about Barney.

36
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:15,361
和Quinn分手对他造成的伤害远不止表面这些
That breakup with Quinn messed him up more than he let on.

37
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:19,161
- 他肯定很孤单 - 我看那小子挺好的啊
I think he's lonely. Dude seems fine to me.

38
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,961
我好爱你哦 流浪兄弟
I love you so much, Brover.

39
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:29,361
说真的 看昨晚的情况
Seriously, based on last night,

40
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:31,561
你和Victoria出问题了
you and Victoria are headed for trouble.

41
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:36,461
有人请我去丹佛经营一家蛋糕店
So I got this kind of interesting job offer to run a bakery in Denver.

42
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:38,661
这也太夸张了 是吧
But that's too crazy, though, right?

43
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:41,061
- 是吧 - 是啊
Right? Uh, yeah.

44
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,061
那么高的海拔会影响糕点的密度吧
The high altitude would affect the density of the pastries.

45
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:46,461
都烤得半生不熟的
I mean, talk about half-baked.

46
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,861
今晚可真开心啊
Man, this is a great night.

47
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:53,361
Victoria是在问你愿不愿意跟她搬去丹佛
That was Victoria asking you to move to Denver with her.

48
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:54,261
什么
What?

49
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:57,561
那她干嘛不直接说呢
Then, why wouldn't she just come right out and say what she wants?

50
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,861
男人啊
Men.

51
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:02,661
除了拧开泡菜子 打死蜘蛛
It's like, if there weren't pickle jars to open and spiders to kill

52
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:05,661
给电脑备份 他们还会干啥
and computers to back up, what would be their point?

53
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:12,161
Marshall什么时候变得比你还娘们儿了
Okay, when did Marshall become a slightly more feminine you?

54
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:15,361
听我说 Ted 总是给别人提建议
Look, Ted, it gets exhausting constantly giving people

55
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,561
人家还不领情 很累知道不 所以我要训练Marshall
advice they haven't asked for, so I'm training Marshall.

56
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,761
我的目标就是 让自己说出来的话
My goal is to eventually say things

57
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:24,261
显得好听又智慧
that are so sassy and wise,

58
00:03:24,261 --> 00:03:30,361
让听的人只能说"嗯 没错"
that there is no possible response other than "mm" or "mm-hmm. "

59
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:32,261
要说我有什么梦想的话
And if this is a place where we can share our dreams-

60
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:33,761
那就是
I like to think that it is-

61
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,761
我希望有一天能够得到一句...
I hope someday to earn a...

62
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:39,661
出徒了
"testify. "

63
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:44,361
听著 我和Victoria在一起五个月 我们现在很好
Look, Victoria and I are five months in and we're right where we should be.

64
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,361
我们一起署名生日卡
All right, we-we're cosigning birthday cards,

65
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:49,761
在对方家里都有牙刷 在窗外搞前戏
w- we got toothbrushes at each other's places, foreplay's out the window.

66
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:54,061
- 进出自由 想睡就睡 好得很 - 可不止五个月
I'm in, I'm out, I'm sleeping, it's great. It's more than five months.

67
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,661
你们以前交往过 那段时间也算
You guys dated before; that time counts.

68
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:58,861
时间不会自动清零
The clock doesn't reset to zero.

69
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:01,261
之前只是暂停 现在又继续了
It un-pauses from where you left off.

70
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:04,261
不可能 时间清零了
No way, no way, the clock resets.

71
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:06,761
等会 你们俩就有这爱好是吧
Wait, so this is what you guys do?

72
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,261
请别的情侣一起吃饭 然后对他们 评头论足 显得你们多优越似的
You invite other couples over for dinner to judge them and feel superior?

73
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:11,961
成熟点 Ted
Oh, grow up, Ted,

74
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,961
这是自古以来每对情侣都有的通病
that's why any couple invites anyone over ever.

75
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:18,561
两杯苏格兰威士忌 纯的
Two Scotches, both neat,

76
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:22,561
再来点坚果 这家伙刚丢了一对儿(坚果=蛋蛋)
and if you've got some, uh, nuts, this guy lost a couple.

77
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,461
一切为了组织
Take the hit, just take the hit.

78
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,461
他这是在求救呢
Okay, this is a cry for help.

79
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:31,061
今晚我们请Barney过来吃饭好吗
Can we invite Barney over for dinner tonight?

80
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:33,061
可是我本来要给你做顿特别大餐
But I was going to make you a special meal to celebrate

81
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:35,861
庆祝我的节目提名本地媒体大奖呢
my show getting nominated for a Local Area Media Award.

82
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,861
<i>哦对 忘说了 Nick在有线台做了一档烹饪节目</i>
<i>Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention,</i> <i>Nick had a cable access cooking show.</i>

83
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:45,361
Nick Podarutti大厨均选用本地出产的新鲜食材
<i>Chef Nick Podarutti uses</i> <i>all fresh, locally grown ingredients,</i>

84
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:50,661
但千万不要以为他就不是坏男孩哦
<i>but don't think for a second</i> <i>that means he's not a bad boy.</i>

85
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,361
她的动力来自玉米
She runs on corn.

86
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,361
* Nick大厨 *
铀?Nick the Bad Boy

87
00:04:57,361 --> 00:05:02,061
* 坏男孩 *
铀?Chef...

88
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:04,361
我要请他过来吃晚饭
I'm gonna invite him over for dinner.

89
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:08,861
那好吧 不过他得有票
Okay, fine, but you'd better make sure he has a ticket.

90
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:13,561
因为"请登上美食列车"
'Cause it's all aboard the Chow-Chow Train!

91
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:17,061
亲爱的 我知道要给美食节目
Honey, I know it's hard coming up

92
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:19,161
想个有代表性的广告语挺难的
with a signature cooking catchphrase,

93
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:21,261
但这个真不行
but I don't think that's it.

94
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:24,061
我知道 可是什么能比得过"砰!"呢
I know, but how do you compete with "Bam!"?

95
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:25,861
这一字可是金不换啊
It just says it all.

96
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,161
嘿 你回来啦
Hey, you.

97
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:32,061
嘿 我能问你点事吗
Hey, can I ask you something?

98
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:34,461
Lily和Marshall觉得
Um, Lily and Marshall think

99
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:39,261
你在暗示我想要更进一步 但我没有理解
I'm missing all these hints you're dropping that you want a deeper commitment.

100
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:41,761
如果是这样 你会直说的 对吧
I mean, you'd just come right out and tell me, right?

101
00:05:41,761 --> 00:05:42,861
当然了
Totally.

102
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:46,861
- 我肯定会直接一点告诉你的 - 谢谢
I- I think I can be a little bit more direct than that. Thank you.

103
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:50,961
哦对 我今天打扫了我的公寓
Oh, hey, I was cleaning my apartment today

104
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:53,461
然后发现了这个
and I dug this up.

105
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:56,661
我要留著这件婚纱吗 还是你觉得
Should I keep this wedding dress, or do you think

106
00:05:56,661 --> 00:05:59,361
我这辈子就再用不著了
I'll never, ever need it again?

107
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,195
- 所以Lily和Marshall是对的 - 当然啊
So Lily and Marshall were right? Of course they're right.

108
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:07,475
一个女孩穿著婚纱钻进你的车
When a girl jumps in your car in a wedding dress,

109
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,938
难道你还惊讶她想要结婚吗
you can't act surprised to find out she wants to get married.

110
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:13,225
再说了 我们以前交往过 那段时间也算
Besides, we dated before, and that time counts.

111
00:06:13,225 --> 00:06:14,825
之前是暂停 现在继续
We just hit pause on the clock.

112
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:17,625
很多智慧的人都觉得时间清零了
See, a lot of really smart people would argue the clock resets.

113
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:21,325
- 就是暂停 大家都懂的 - Barney有点晚了
It un-pauses, everybody knows that. You know, Barney's a little late.

114
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,325
希望他没事
I hope he's okay.

115
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:25,125
没事的 而且我根本不觉得他在求救
Ah, he's fine, and I still don't think he's crying out for help.

116
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:26,025
这个...
Well...

117
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,525
抱歉我们迟到了 刚从裁缝那回来
Sorry we're late. We just came from the tailor.

118
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,925
流浪兄弟选不定领带 所以我就都买了
Brover couldn't settle on a tie, so I just bought them all.

119
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:38,825
看这小脸 不忍拒绝啊
You say no to that face.

120
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:47,225
你不能完全确定我们的事 肯定是有原因的 Ted
There's a reason that you're not a hundred percent in this with me, Ted.

121
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:49,525
我们之间有阻碍
Something's holding us back.

122
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:50,825
是什么呢
Well, what is it?

123
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:56,625
咱都知道我不擅长把握线索 说到这个
I think we've established I'm not great at picking up on clues- well, in this situation.

124
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,925
我小时候可是个小侦探哦
As a kid, I was known as a bit of a detective.

125
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:01,925
我朋友的牙架丢了
In fact, when my friend's retainer went missing,

126
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:04,225
Mosby男孩接手案件 结果它在...
the Mosby Boys were put on the case, and it was...

127
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:07,925
在垃圾箱里 Mosby男孩就是你和你妹
The retainer was in the garbage. The Mosby Boys were you, your sister,

128
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:10,825
还有你自以为被你驯服的小松鼠
and a neighborhood squirrel you thought you had tamed.

129
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:13,425
真想不到松鼠福尔摩斯会那么让我们失望
I can't believe Squirrel-lock Holmes turned on us like that.

130
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:17,525
- 训练了八周呢 - 你知道我怎么知道的么 Ted
Eight weeks of training down the drain. You know how I know that, Ted?

131
00:07:17,525 --> 00:07:22,225
因为六年前 在我们决定加深t解时说过的
Because we covered it in the "getting to know you" part of the relationship six years ago.

132
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:24,125
六年
Six years.

133
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,725
那到底是什么在阻碍我们
Then... what's holding us back?

134
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:36,838
去找Mosby男孩 Ted 破案了告诉我
Call in the Mosby Boys, Ted, let me know if they crack the case.

135
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:42,625
伙计们
Guys,

136
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,525
流浪兄弟不只是我有过最棒的兄弟
Brover is not only the best bro I've ever had,

137
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:49,225
他还很会和姑娘们打交道呢
he's amazing with the ladies.

138
00:07:49,225 --> 00:07:53,025
不好意思 你不觉得利用一只狗去泡钮挺悲哀的吗
I'm sorry, don't you think it's a little pathetic to use a dog to pick up chicks?

139
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:56,425
先生 泡钮搭档的关系是双向的
Sir, wingmanship is a two-way street.

140
00:07:56,825 --> 00:08:00,125
如果流浪兄弟看上了谁 我也愿为组织牺牲
<i>If Brover meets a cutie, I'll take the hit</i>

141
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:02,725
陪她的肥钮朋友聊天
<i>and chat up the chubby lady friend.</i>

142
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,625
有时会装成恶棍
<i>Sometimes I'll be the jerk...</i>

143
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:13,425
让流浪兄弟英雄救美
<i>...so Brover can swoop in and be the hero.</i>

144
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:15,625
和任何一个称职的泡钮搭档一样
<i>And like any good wingman,</i>

145
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,825
我会保持理智的头脑
<i>I gather as much intel as I can right up front.</i>

146
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:21,125
- 你的狗几岁了 - 五岁
How old's your dog? She's five. Oh.

147
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:24,125
- 按狗的寿命来说是多大 - 大概35岁
What's that in dog years? Like, 35.

148
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,325
拜拜了您哪
We're done here.

149
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,325
你们说得对
Well, you were right.

150
00:08:28,325 --> 00:08:32,625
Victoria说我们之间有阻碍 可我想不出是什么
Victoria says something's holding us back, and I don't have any idea what it is.

151
00:08:32,825 --> 00:08:34,625
有什么好想法吗 Oprah
Any brilliant insights, Oprah?

152
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,525
Steadman (Oprah的前男友)
Steadman?

153
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:37,525
你咋不说Gayle (曾被传和Oprah是同性恋人)
Um, try Gayle.

154
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:43,625
Marshall 交给你 你已经准备好了
Marshall, I want you to take this one. You're ready.

155
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,525
不好说啊
Oh, I don't know.

156
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:51,625
不过我脑子里确实有个声音在说些什么
Although I do hear this little voice in the back of my head trying to tell me something.

157
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:53,725
那是你内心的女神
That's your inner goddess.

158
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:56,025
倾听她 引导她
Listen to her, channel her.

159
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,425
如果Victoria对你来说
If Victoria quenches your

160
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,525
就像炎热七月里的一杯甜茶
thirst like a tall glass

161
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,625
那样解渴
of sweet tea on a hot July day...

162
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,725
Marshall 你女神咋南方口音
Marshall, why is she Southern?

163
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,625
别害他中断连接
Don't let him break the connection.

164
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:09,925
你就必须对她诚实以待
...well, you got to make an honest woman out of her.

165
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,825
我走了
Okay, I'm leaving.

166
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:13,025
但是 但是
But, but,

167
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:16,625
如果你做不到 小蜜糖
if not, well, then, sugar...

168
00:09:17,525 --> 00:09:19,625
你就应该让那只小夜莺
...you got to let that nightingale

169
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:23,725
展开双臂 振翅高飞
spread her wings and soar

170
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:26,925
通向属于她的美好明天
to her own beautiful tomorrow.

171
00:09:27,425 --> 00:09:29,425
出徒了
Testify.

172
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:33,025
你们俩讨厌死了
You guys are the worst.

173
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:41,725
我在哪里
Where am I?

174
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,525
抱歉
Sorry.

175
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,125
我是Barney
Uh, go for Barney.

176
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,125
我知道
I see.

177
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:56,025
完全明白
Totally understood.

178
00:09:57,125 --> 00:10:00,125
我会的 很好
I'll do that. Great.

179
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:01,525
谢谢
<i>Thank you.</i>

180
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:04,625
是流浪兄弟的主人
That was Brover's owner.

181
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:08,125
她出城的时候 他从狗窝里跑了出来
I guess, while she was out of town, he ran away from his kennel,

182
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,225
现在她回来了 我得把他还回去
and now that she's back, I have to return him.

183
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:15,025
- Barney 我很遗憾 - 没事
Oh, Barney, I'm so sorry. Oh, it's all good.

184
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,625
我先失陪一下
Um, excuse me for one moment.

185
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:34,525
Barney
Barney.

186
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:38,725
别拦我
No, no. No, no!

187
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:51,725
Victoria
Victoria.

188
00:10:56,225 --> 00:11:00,525
- 你愿意嫁给我吗 - 当然愿意
Will you marry me? Yes, of course.

189
00:11:05,325 --> 00:11:06,525
只有一件事
There's just one thing.

190
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:08,325
任何事都可以 你尽管说
Anything. You name it.

191
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,325
你不能再和Robin作朋友
You can't be friends with Robin.

192
00:11:16,696 --> 00:11:19,600
如果我还和Robin作朋友 你就不愿意嫁给我吗
You won't marry me if I'm still friends with Robin?

193
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,797
等等 难道她就是我们的阻碍?
Wait. She's the thing that's been holding us back?

194
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,447
过去的事情太复杂了
There-There's just too much history there.

195
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:29,847
我们第一次分手就是因为Robin Robin是我们的路障
I mean, Robin's the reason that we broke up the first time around. Robin's our roadblock.

196
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:34,347
Robin是黑暗的深洞 会葬送我们的爱情
Robin's the deep, dark pit where our relationship goes to die.

197
00:11:34,747 --> 00:11:36,947
不过她是好姑娘 优秀青年
But nicest girl in the world. Salt of the earth.

198
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:38,747
可她现在和Nick在一起了啊
But she's with Nick now.

199
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:42,247
尽管他的烹饪节目里Q是些奇奇怪怪的广告词
I mean, sure, his cooking show is lousy with awkward catchphrase attempts.

200
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:45,747
我的妈呀 来点点心吗
Oh, my gosh, who's ready to nosh?

201
00:11:46,147 --> 00:11:48,547
谁对美食垂涎欲滴啊 (pop a chub也指勃起)
Who's popping a chub for some grub?

202
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:55,947
我向被"垂涎欲滴"冒犯到的观众朋友表示真诚的歉意
I offer my deepest apologies to anyone who was offended by my "popping a chub" remark.

203
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:58,847
我会更加努力 下不为例
I can and will do better. Won't happen again.

204
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:02,247
谁想吃我的肉啊
And now who's ready to eat my meat?

205
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,747
有没有搞错
Oh, come on.

206
00:12:04,747 --> 00:12:09,047
可Robin跟Nick在一起很幸福 我和你在一起也很幸福
But Robin's happy with Nick, and I'm happy with you.

207
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:12,447
你看 我刚刚都跟你求婚了
Look, I, I just asked you to be my wife.

208
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:15,147
这还不能证明我跟Robin之间没什么吗
Isn't that proof there's nothing between me and Robin?

209
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:18,447
也许今天是没有 可明天呢
Well, maybe today there isn't, but what about tomorrow?

210
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,547
或者下星期 又或者15年后呢
Or next week or 15 years from now?

211
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,547
我会一直感到不安
I'll always be wondering.

212
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,847
我并不想对你说出
I never wanted to be that girl who says

213
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,547
"Robin还是我"这种话
it's Robin or it's me,

214
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:32,047
可是...
but, well...

215
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:35,047
选Robin还是选你
It's Robin or it's you.

216
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,947
你是个很棒的泡钮搭档
You've been a hell of a wingman.

217
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:43,947
尽管我觉得你自己舔自己挺f心的
And even though I think it's kind of gross when you pleasure yourself orally,

218
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:46,947
但我确实是大开眼界
don't ever think that means I'm not impressed.

219
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:53,747
你说把流浪兄弟送回去 Barney不会有事吧
do you think that Barney's gonna be okay bringing Brover back?

220
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:54,847
当然不会
Yeah, he'll be fine.

221
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:58,547
这不仅仅是一种能给自己口交的能力
It's not just the ability to go to town on yourself,

222
00:12:58,547 --> 00:13:01,747
更是人生一大乐事啊
but you do it with such joie de vivre.

223
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,647
我觉得我应该陪他去
I really think that I should go with him.

224
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:08,647
不行 你得吃这些薄煎饼 都烤好了
No, but you got to eat these cr锚pes as soon as they're flamb茅ed.

225
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:11,447
保证让你胃口大开哦
They're gonna be bon appe-sweet!

226
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:13,147
- 不好 - 奶奶的
No. Damn.

227
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:14,647
等我回来咱们一起想
We'll work on it when I get back.

228
00:13:14,647 --> 00:13:17,247
不用 我懂了 我为这些忙活了一整晚
No, I get it. You know, I only spent all night working on these,

229
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:18,747
可是呢 Barney更重要
but, hey, Barney's more important.

230
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:21,447
- Nick - 没事 去吧
Nick... It's fine. Go.

231
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,447
总之呢 这也没什么大不了的
Anyway, let's not make a big deal of it.

232
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:27,947
我们不过是一起玩了几天 找了点乐子
We hung out for a few days, had some fun...

233
00:13:28,247 --> 00:13:29,647
算什么呀
No big woof.

234
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,347
我不会忘记你的
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU

235
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:33,947
没有你我可咋办
I don't know who I am without you.

236
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:38,747
真荒唐
This is crazy.

237
00:13:38,747 --> 00:13:41,847
Victoria对Robin这事也太不讲理了
Victoria is being completely unreasonable about Robin,

238
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:44,247
我的响指姐妹支援两句
and my snap sister is gonna back me up.

239
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:48,047
我再来一次
I say again...

240
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:53,247
我有点能理解Victoria
I kind of see Victoria's point.

241
00:13:53,247 --> 00:13:57,047
- 软糖小姐没听清楚 - Ted和Robin有过太多过去
Come again for Ms. Fudge? Ted and Robin have so much history.

242
00:13:57,047 --> 00:14:00,047
没错 是过去 早都翻篇儿了
Exactly. History. Ancient history.

243
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:04,047
Ted 今年你还对她说过"我爱你"呢
Ted, you said "I love you" to her earlier this year.

244
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:07,847
我并不是说她做得对 但我能理解
I'm not saying this is fair, but I get it.

245
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,447
我完全不理解
I didn't get that at all.

246
00:14:11,447 --> 00:14:13,647
我内心的女神怎么弃我而去了呢
How could my inner goddess be so far off?

247
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:17,447
以后你会懂的 Oprah的境界也不是一天修炼成的啊
Oh, you'll get there, honey. Oprah wasn't built in a day.

248
00:14:19,047 --> 00:14:21,447
- 嗯 - 怎么了
Uh-oh. What?

249
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:23,747
我稍微淘气了一下
I kind of went rogue.

250
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:28,247
如果你真的想要孩子 别再吃药就好了
Look, if you really want to have a baby, just stop taking the pill.

251
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:32,047
你们俩三年前的春假上过床
You guys slept together at spring break three years ago.

252
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,447
这里肯定有事儿
That means something.

253
00:14:34,847 --> 00:14:38,047
喜欢电视插曲 超级购物狂
Loves show tunes, total shopaholic,

254
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:40,347
不总缠著你求爱爱
not always pestering you for sex?

255
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,747
Clifford听起来可以托付终生
Um, Clifford sounds like a keeper.

256
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:46,747
Marshall 你这些建议都烂透了
Marshall, all of that advice was terrible.

257
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:49,847
那也比你建议Ted和Robin不要再作朋友了强
Not as terrible as you saying that Ted and Robin should stop being friends.

258
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,147
我没说他们应该这样 那就太糟糕了
I'm not saying they should. It would be horrible.

259
00:14:53,347 --> 00:14:56,847
可如果Ted真的想和Victoria在一起...
But if Ted really wants to be with Victoria...

260
00:14:57,947 --> 00:14:59,647
Ted 告诉她
Ted, tell her

261
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:02,247
你不会和Robin绝交的
that you're not gonna stop being friends with Robin.

262
00:15:04,047 --> 00:15:06,447
我无法想像没有Robin的人生
I can't imagine life without Robin.

263
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:09,547
可她不可能爱上我
But she'll never be in love with me.

264
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:11,847
不可能作我的妻子
She'll never be my wife.

265
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,647
不可能和我一起变老
She'll never be the person I grow old with.

266
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:18,347
Victoria...
Victoria...

267
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:21,147
Victoria可能可以
Victoria could be.

268
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:24,947
你说的跟我想的是一个意思吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

269
00:15:35,347 --> 00:15:37,147
准备好说再见了吗
You ready to say good-bye?

270
00:15:39,747 --> 00:15:41,047
谢谢你陪我来
Thanks for coming with me.

271
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:45,947
我把我的狗送走时 你也是这样对我的 记得吗
Oh, well, you did the same for me back when I had to give away all my dogs. Remember?

272
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:49,247
对啊 我们开车去你阿姨家的农场
Oh, yeah, we drove to your aunt's farm upstate.

273
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,447
她人很好
She was awesome.

274
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,847
我喜欢她聪慧成熟淡定的
Yeah. I love how she was this wise, old, chilled out,

275
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:54,247
蕾丝边农场主气质
lesbian farmer.

276
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:58,847
不不不 她不是蕾丝边 她也不是农场主
No, no, no. She's not a lesbian. Nor does she farm them.

277
00:15:58,847 --> 00:16:02,447
跟她同住的女人只是她一个特别的朋友Maureen
No, that woman she lives with, that's just her special friend Maureen.

278
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:04,147
她们一起住了...
They've lived together for...

279
00:16:09,447 --> 00:16:12,147
这肯定会很难过的
Oh, this is gonna be tough.

280
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:15,047
流浪兄弟真是最棒的泡钮搭档
Brover really was the best wingman ever.

281
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,747
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

282
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:25,547
非常感谢你
Thank you so much for bringing

283
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:28,447
- 把小雨点送回来 - 小雨点
Mr. Sprinkles back. Mr. Sprinkles...

284
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,747
真是个好听的狗狗名字
is a great name for a dog.

285
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:34,047
妈咪好想你 真的好想啊
Mommy missed you so much. Yes, she did.

286
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,247
这对情侣有好好照顾你吗
Did this nice couple take care of you?

287
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:41,547
太好笑了
That's a laugh. Ha.

288
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,047
兄弟
Big bro.

289
00:16:43,947 --> 00:16:45,747
我得撤了 嗯 走了
I got to split. Yeah, I got to,

290
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:47,647
我得回农场去
I got to head back to the farm...

291
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:51,147
我和我的特别朋友Maureen住在一起
where I live with my special friend Maureen.

292
00:16:51,547 --> 00:16:55,747
我现在意识到她其实是我的同性伴侣
Whom I now realize is my lesbian life partner.

293
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,347
惊讶吧
Surprise.

294
00:16:57,747 --> 00:16:59,947
好了
Okay. All right.

295
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:01,647
那么
So...

296
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,547
你要不要喝一杯
would you like a drink?

297
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,347
最棒的泡钮搭档
Best wingman ever.

298
00:17:17,347 --> 00:17:19,547
这是什么 我还以为你在生我的气
What's all this? I thought you were mad at me.

299
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,947
本来是在生气 但后来我意识到
I was... but then I realized

300
00:17:22,947 --> 00:17:25,747
我必须要接受你有亲密的男性朋友这个事实
I just have to accept that you have close guy friends.

301
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,447
但我可不希望这习惯成自然
I mean, I don't want it becoming a habit

302
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,047
大半夜的把你叫走什么的
that they steal you away from me in the middle of the night.

303
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:31,147
但是
But...

304
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:33,147
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

305
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:36,447
Ted想见我
Oh, Ted needs to see me.

306
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:40,747
- 我的老天 你这个女人 - 不是你想的那样 他只是想嘿休而已
Oh, for the love of God, woman. Oh, it's not what you think. He just wants to have sex.

307
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:42,847
开玩笑啦
Kidding.

308
00:17:43,447 --> 00:17:46,247
只要动动手就好 还是开玩笑啦
Just a little hand stuff. Ha. Kidding again.

309
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:49,447
Ted对胸部最著迷 我怎么就停不住了
Ted's more of a boob man. I seriously can't stop.

310
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:52,047
他有什么事
What does he want? Um...

311
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:54,647
不知道 可他说是急事
I don't know, but he says it's urgent.

312
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:59,347
对不起 再让我被夺走一下下吧
I'm so sorry. Just one more little steal-away.

313
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:01,747
只要你还会回来
Just as long as he gives you back.

314
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:04,447
谢谢
Thanks.

315
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:18,347
NO ...

316
00:18:22,347 --> 00:18:23,147
那么
So...

317
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:25,147
你还好吗
are you okay?

318
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:29,047
到底是什么急事 都不能等到明天
What is this big, urgent thing that couldn't wait till tomorrow?

319
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:33,347
我有件事要告诉你
There's something I have to tell you.

320
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,547
这件事我常常在想
I've thought about this a ton,

321
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:38,747
而且
and, um...

322
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:43,347
我本来不希望说起这件事
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this,

323
00:18:43,347 --> 00:18:44,447
但是
but...

324
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:51,747
我不爱Robin
I'm not in love with Robin, um,

325
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,547
但她就像是我的家人
but she's like family to me, and, uh...

326
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:58,047
我不能结束这一切
I can't end that.

327
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,447
所以
So...

328
00:19:01,147 --> 00:19:02,747
你可以接受吗
can you accept that?

329
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:15,147
我真的希望有一天你能得到她
I really hope you get her some day.

330
00:19:31,347 --> 00:19:32,547
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

331
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:39,947
昨晚Ted打给我让我去酒吧 说有急事
So, last night Ted calls me out to the bar to talk about something urgent.

332
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,847
你们猜是什么
Guess what it was.

333
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:46,247
他想写一部青少年系列推理小说
He wants to write a series of young adult mystery novels

334
00:19:46,247 --> 00:19:48,747
叫"Mosby男孩"
<i>called The Mosby Boys.</i>

335
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:51,247
你干嘛非要告诉我这个
Why did you need to tell me that?

336
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,447
你在媒体界嘛 人面广大
You work in the media. You know people.

337
00:19:53,447 --> 00:19:57,647
好吧 首先无视掉Mosby白痴 著重写会破案的松鼠
Okay, well, first of all, lose the Mosby nerds and focus on that crime-solving squirrel.

338
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:59,147
那家伙太棒了
That guy is gold. Yeah.

339
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:01,647
第二 下次你再想大半夜的商谈要事
And secondly, next time you have a big idea late at night,

340
00:20:01,647 --> 00:20:03,547
拜托去烦你的女朋友
please bug your girlfriend about it.

341
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:07,347
其实 我和Victoria分手了
Uh, actually... Victoria and I broke up.

342
00:20:07,347 --> 00:20:08,747
天啊
Oh, my God.

343
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:11,947
为什么 发生什么事了
Why, what, what happened?

344
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:14,947
我们只是 想要不同的生活
We just, you know, wanted different things.

345
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,947
真遗憾 兄弟
I'm so sorry, buddy.

346
00:20:19,947 --> 00:20:24,047
但往好处想 如果Robin知道你是因为她
But, bright side... Robin is gonna be so touched

347
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,847
才和Victoria分手 一定会很感动的
when she hears you ended things with Victoria because of her.

348
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:31,347
不能让她知道 答应我 永远不会让Robin知道这件事
She can never know. Promise me Robin will never find out.

349
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:33,547
- 我不明白 - 答应我
I don't understand. Promise.

350
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:36,247
答应你
Promise. Promise.

351
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:39,847
<i>当然 Robin还是知道了</i>
<i>Of course,</i> <i>Robin did find out.</i>

352
00:20:40,547 --> 00:20:42,347
<i>我们以后再讲</i>
<i>But we'll get to that.</i>

353
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:57,567
兄弟 救我
BRO HELP

354
00:20:57,612 --> 00:20:59,497
有个疯婆子说我把她肚子搞大了
SOME ...UP

355
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:01,645
你还是个爷们儿啊
So you do have balls?

356
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,797
快跑
Run!
