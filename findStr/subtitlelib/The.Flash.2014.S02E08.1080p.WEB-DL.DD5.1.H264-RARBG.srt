00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:58,376
- You mean Egyptian?
- That's right.

176
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:00,545
- Well, I grew up
in Wisconsin,

177
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:03,748
and I've never even
left the States, so...

178
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,318
- This guy, he's clearly
incredibly dangerous,

179
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,854
so I need you to at least
let us try to protect you.

180
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,322
- I can put a detail on her.

181
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:11,590
- You didn't see
this guy, Joe.

182
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,791
No offense,
but I don't think a cop

183
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,392
is going to be able
to protect her.

184
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:17,829
- No, but we do have a few
friends who could lend a hand.

185
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,431
But we're going to need
to leave Central City.

186
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,033
- And go where?

187
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,902
- You really want to go
to Star City?

188
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,904
Come on, we don't need
Team Arrow's help.

189
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:27,639
- Yeah,
I think we do, man.

190
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,407
- Man, you've fought
meta-humans with abilities

191
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,842
a lot worse
than knife-throwing.

192
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,477
- I don't think
this guy's a meta-human.

193
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,713
There's something
different about him,

194
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,282
something, ah, mystical.

195
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:38,817
- Mystical, really?

196
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,719
- We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

197
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,420
We can figure out
what their weaknesses are,

198
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,323
but we don't have any experience

anything to do
with Zoom, would it?

203
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,930
- No.

I'm just trying
to keep Kendra safe.

00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,666
This is the best way
to do that.

206
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,701
- Right.
Okay, I'm with you.

207
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,803
But how do we even know
Oliver and them

208
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,572

Open it up.

215

They could've at least tried
to hide this chemical bomb.

216
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,625

stolen and used against them.

Oh, you brought arrows
to a gunfight.

218

- What guns?

219
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:35,307

pretty clever.

- Okay, what else
can you tell us?

- He said we've known
each other for ages,

298

but I've never met
the man before.

299
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,960
- There has to be
some kind of connection.

- Not one I can think of.

00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,465
I just moved
to Central City six months ago.

00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,833
- Why'd you move there?

303
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,402
- I just felt drawn
to the city, I guess.

- Barry, none of us
have superpowers.

314
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,822
You brought Kendra
into our world

315
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,223

316

00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,809
- What you working on?

325
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,978
- This is a formula

326
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,747
meant to increase
a speedster's velocity

327
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,815
that I've been developing

328
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,051

on my earth.

329

Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

330
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:18,423
- You want to give Barry a drug
to make him run faster?

331
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:21,259
- Temporarily enhance the
Speed Force in his system, yes.

332
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,895
- So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

333
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,230
- Good analogy.
Yes, I tried.

334
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,031
Five times I tried.
Five times I failed.

335
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,033
That's what you get when
your background is technology

336
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,168
and not biochemistry.

337
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,070
- Well, then you are lucky
I am here.

338
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,171
- What does that mean?

339
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:34,505
- You've been thinking of this

340
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,941
as a mechanical problem,
not a biomechanical one.

341
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,142
- And what does that mean?

342
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,844
- When a speedster runs,
they consume

343
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,046
an extraordinary
amount of oxygen,

344
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,882
so we just need something
to give an extra boost

345
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,083
of oxygen during that time.

346
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,784
- Like an oxygen generator.

347
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:47,852
- Exactly.

348
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,320
So we just need a chemical

349
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,990
that's rich in oxygen
that would release it

350
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,792
as a nearly pure gas
as it decomposes--

351
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:55,960
something like...

352
00:14:55,962 --> 00:14:57,395
both:
Sodium chlorate.

353
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,098
- Then all we'd need is heat
to release the oxygen.

generates naturally

355

like this just might work.

00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,906
- You think you can help
me figure it out?

358
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,174
- I can certainly try.

359
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,877

my nickname.

00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,212
I like Speedy.

361
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,713
- Are you familiar
with my body of work?

362
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:18,082
If you are, then you know
I can come up with something

363
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,351
so much better than Speedy.

364
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,021

get a haircut?

365
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,656
And then maybe
we can talk about it.

366
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,524

because my conditioner game

367

is on point.

368
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,528
- So the CEO
of Palmer Technologies

369
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,230
is living with Oliver Queen.

370
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:34,599

- Yeah. No, it's been
trippy lately.

376
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,045
- I wonder what Oliver's
doppelganger would look like.

377
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:50,815
Bald, pot-bellied...
- Uh-huh.

She's amazing.

383
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,394

someone amazing.

No, but I'm glad

It shows a real maturity,
and I would know that

that mature.

It wasn't a man.

It was Kendra.

She was, like, a bird.

anything about this sooner?

it was related,

now it has to be.

00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,285
But one thing
the League knows for sure--

522
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:35,453
he was there for all of it.

523
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,754
- So what are you saying?

524
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,155
He's like a vampire
or something?

525
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,858
- Not a vampire,
an Immortal.

526
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,127
- Okay, we've officially
stepped into crazy town.

527
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,428
Immortality?

528
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,996
- Wait. No, no, no,
this makes sense.

529
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:50,034
This explains why he looks
the same as he did in 1975.

530
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,535
- This can't be possible.

531
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:55,406
- There's nothing
you can do to save her now.

532
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,441
- Kendra, do not listen
to him.

533
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,977
- I-I just need some air.

534
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:07,051
- Hey, we're gonna do

535
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,886
whatever we have to
to keep Kendra safe,

536
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,654
whether you think
we can or not.

537
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,256
- Hey, Joe, it's Patty.

538
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:14,458
I just interviewed a weapons
expert about the flint knife

539
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,793
our attacker used.

540
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,995
Found out something
pretty interesting,

541
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,764
uh, so call me back.

Hey, you going to be
all right?

545
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,677
- It's just a lot
to take in right now.

546
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,746
- Look, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about me before.

547
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:39,049
I didn't want things
to be different between us.

548
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:40,484
- It's not that, Cisco.

549
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,386
If what everyone's
saying is true--

550
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,155
and it's beginning
to seem like it is--

551
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:46,891
my whole life just changed,

552
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,826
and I am so not ready
for that.

553
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:51,896
- I hear what you're saying.
I do.

554
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:56,767
When I first learned
about my powers,

555
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,770
I remember feeling
that exact same feeling,

556
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,672
and sometimes I still
feel that way,

557
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:04,975
and all I can say is...

558
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:09,880
every day gets
a little bit more normal.

559
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,783

other again and again and again.

- Do you know
who Vandal Savage is?

663
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:23,520
- In every lifetime,
he hunts us down and kills us.

664
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,455
He's done it 206 times,

665
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,558
and I'm not planning
to make it 207.

666
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,259
- Why does he kill you?

667
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,429
- His life force
is tethered to ours.

668
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,331
Every time he kills us,
he becomes more powerful.

669
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,432
You do the math.

670
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:36,934
- You're 0 for 206,

671
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,203
and you still think
you're her best bet, hmm?

672
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,738

is just find Savage

673
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,473

674
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:46,176

of him, my friend.

675

Watch us.

676
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:50,547
- It might be harder
than you think.

677
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,750
- Is that the only way this guy
knows how to enter a room?

678
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:57,020
- My associates tell me Savage
left Star City a few hours ago.

679
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,589
- For where?
- We're not quite sure.

680
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,224
But I assume
after his run-in with you,

681
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:02,526
he realized he needed
something more powerful

682
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,494
to complete his mission.

683
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,464
We think he's trying to locate
the Staff of Horus.

684
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,199
- Sorry, what is that?

685
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,001
- It's a relic
from our past--

686
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:14,304
an ancient
and powerful weapon.

687
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,173
If Savage gets
his hands on it,

688
00:31:16,175 --> 00:31:18,208
it's going to be nearly
impossible to stop him.

689
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,943
- Since when did our lives
suddenly become

690
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,745

691
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:22,980
- Felicity?
- Yeah?

692
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,381

- Yeah.
