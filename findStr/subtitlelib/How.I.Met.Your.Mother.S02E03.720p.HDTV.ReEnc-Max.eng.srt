1
00:00:00,514 --> 00:00:01,934
Kids, you know that photo in the den

2
00:00:02,058 --> 00:00:06,098
It was taken back in 2006,
when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,600
and we all went out to brunch.

4
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:09,455
We all look pretty
happy, right?

5
00:00:09,704 --> 00:00:10,764
Wrong.

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,120
I wish your face
would melt off.

7
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:13,399
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.

8
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:15,855
- I hate you.
- I hate you more.

9
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,061
- I'm going to kill him.
- I can't say I blame you.

10
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,347
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.

11
00:00:20,364 --> 00:00:22,764
I don't care how unpleasant it is.
You have to talk to him.

12
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,683
- Not now.
- Okay, if you don't, I will.

13
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:25,889
Robin...

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,249
Okay, for any of this to make sense,
you got to understand,

15
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:31,097
there are three
parts to this story.

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,529
Let's start with the
Marshall and Lily part.

17
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:39,633
As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown
my parents to New York for the weekend.

18
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:41,727
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
your cousin Jimmy

19
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,290
had a wonderful time at
that spa he visited.

20
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:47,534
You mean the spa the judge ordered
him to go to to quit cocaine?

21
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:49,040
Coffee?

22
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:52,115
Now, Grandma and Grandpa didn't
like to talk about things

23
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,165
that were
uncomfortable, emotional,

24
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,180
or in any way... real.

25
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:58,083
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.

26
00:00:58,097 --> 00:01:00,077
Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall.

27
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,020
Good to see you.

28
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:03,724
I was just stopping by to
pick up some of my things.

29
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:07,015
Yes, we were so sorry
to hear about your...

30
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:09,245
you know, the, the...

31
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:12,499
Well...

32
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:14,536
Lily calling off the
wedding and dumping me?

33
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,559
Me begging Marshall to take
me back and him rejecting me?

34
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:19,418
I love your hair.

35
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:23,014
Sync by vNaru

36
00:01:33,238 --> 00:01:35,338
This was only the second
time Marshall and Lily

37
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,240
had seen each other
since breaking up,

38
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:39,593
but to their credit,
it wasn't that awkward.

39
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:41,055
Actually, we're cool.

40
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:44,121
We just divided up CDs.
It was all very civil.

41
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:45,821
I'm proud of us;
we're, we're good.

42
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:49,294
Well, we were all going to
go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.

43
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:51,545
Lily, would you
like to join us?

44
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,377
Um...

45
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,630
What?

46
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:58,934
Well, I-I don't want to go if it
would make you uncomfortable.

47
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:00,331
Why would it?

48
00:02:00,345 --> 00:02:03,215
Well, I mean, yeah, we're...
we're good,

49
00:02:03,234 --> 00:02:07,584
but you got to admit there's
that stuff between us.

50
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:09,411
Um, not for me.

51
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,645
Now it's just like
we're friends.

52
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,685
It's like we're
brother and sister.

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,470
"Brother and sister"?!

54
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,980
Okay. Fine, yeah,
I'll see you at the restaurant, bro.

55
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,170
See? Not awkward at all.

56
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,087
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

57
00:02:30,104 --> 00:02:31,604
Hello, Marshall.

58
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:33,856
Lily, that is a stunning dress.

59
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,781
Oh, thanks.

60
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,902
It's kind of revealing,
but I thought,

61
00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,247
"Hey, we're all
family." Right, bro?

62
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:43,741
What's wrong?

63
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:47,067
Oh, I,
I hurt my ankle in yoga today.

64
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:49,505
The instructor told me to
just take deep breaths

65
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:51,797
to get through
the pain, just...

66
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:01,855
Are you all right?
You're kind of sweating.

67
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:04,004
No, I'm fine. It's just...

68
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,886
this roll is really spicy.

69
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,105
Lily is evil!

70
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,290
She just wore that
dress to torture me.

71
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:13,362
Well, you know what?
Two can play at that game.

72
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:16,513
See, at brunch,
I'm going to torture Lily right back.

73
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:19,683
Yeah. There's a part of my body
that she's got a weakness for, too.

74
00:03:19,693 --> 00:03:22,413
Dude, you can't whip
that out at brunch.

75
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,680
No, not that.

76
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:28,735
I'm going to unleash my calves.

77
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,951
That's crazy.

78
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:33,043
Nobody's turned on
by men's calves.

79
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,549
They're a thoroughly
unerotic body part.

80
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:39,599
Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I
had those skinny little chicken legs.

81
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:43,981
I'll be waiting by the
phone for your apology.

82
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:48,335
So Marshall showed up
at brunch with a plan.

83
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,778
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

84
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:51,151
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hey.

85
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:52,897
Hey. How are you feeling?

86
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,169
You looked kind of
feverish last night.

87
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:57,312
Oh, no, I actually feel great.

88
00:03:58,023 --> 00:04:00,663
It is kind of warm in here,
though, isn't it?

89
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:03,236
Oh, I don't know,
if anything, it's kind of...

90
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:04,225
What are you doing?

91
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:06,072
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

92
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:10,007
I'm just making myself feel a
little bit more... comfortable.

93
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:15,988
Oh.

94
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:18,431
Oh, yes.

95
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:22,023
I've been doing all these
toe lifts lately, and so...

96
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:25,271
my calves have really
been cramping up.

97
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,007
Take off your dress.

98
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,331
Take off the rest
of your pants.

99
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,870
I really wasn't
expecting that to happen.

100
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,941
Yeah, me neither. It kind of
complicates things, doesn't it?

101
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:48,076
Yeah, it does. Why did you have to
throw your magnificent calves at me?

102
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,640
You know you have
a punter's leg.

103
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,066
Well, why did you have to throw
your beautiful boobs at me?

104
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:54,658
You know you have... boobs.

105
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:58,347
Just admit it,
you came here trying to seduce me.

106
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,307
Seduce you? You seduced me.

107
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:03,251
You sat down next to me and
took most of your pants off.

108
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,510
You went to San Francisco
for three months.

109
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,942
How is that seducing you?

110
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,498
Well, it's not but I'm
still mad about it.

111
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,982
All right, that's it--
I want The Beatles Anthology.

112
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:12,314
Oh, well, that's too bad;
I'm keeping it.

113
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:14,388
And you know the U2
box set I gave you?

114
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,442
Look inside--
all Dave Matthews.

115
00:05:16,453 --> 00:05:17,843
You are evil.

116
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:19,528
Smile.

117
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:22,668
I'm going to kill him.

118
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:23,991
I can't say I blame you.

119
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:26,998
No, I mean I'm seriously
going to kill him.

120
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:31,233
Now let's talk about the
Barney part of the story.

121
00:05:32,904 --> 00:05:35,624
This was going to be Robin's
first time meeting my parents,

122
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,926
so we were both
a little nervous.

123
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,815
Barney, what are
you doing here?

124
00:05:40,837 --> 00:05:42,817
Uh... I'm here to
meet your parents.

125
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,099
They must be dying
to meet me after all

126
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,035
the legendary Barney
stories you've told them.

127
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,950
I haven't told them any
legendary Barney stories.

128
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:48,862
What?

129
00:05:48,878 --> 00:05:53,758
Barney, here is a list of all the things
I talk with my dad about: baseball.

130
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,413
But I'm your best friend.

131
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,490
Well, actually Marshall's my...

132
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:00,317
I'm the most important
person in your life.

133
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,368
Well, Robin's actually...

134
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:03,734
How could your parents
not know about me?

135
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:05,088
I'm delightful.

136
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:09,324
To us, sure, in very small,
infrequent doses.

137
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,157
I mean, come on,
you're not exactly the kind of friend

138
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:12,952
parents want their kid to have.

139
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:14,505
Oh, really?

140
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,750
Then I guess those
shoes aren't the thing

141
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:19,084
you're most wrong about today.

142
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:24,542
- Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.
- Ted.

143
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:26,246
I know you've all been
excited to meet...

144
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:30,251
Barney Stinson.
An honor to meet the two of you.

145
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:32,668
That needlepoint "Bless This
Mess" pillow you made for Ted--

146
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,015
what a stitch.

147
00:06:34,023 --> 00:06:36,173
Stitch! Did that just happen?

148
00:06:37,806 --> 00:06:39,936
Uh, Mom, Dad,
this is my girlfriend, Robin.

149
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:40,966
- Hello.
- Hello.

150
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:42,922
Oh, it's wonderful
to meet you, Robin.

151
00:06:42,932 --> 00:06:45,932
Oh, you are so pretty.
Isn't she pretty, Al?

152
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:47,003
A real looker.

153
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,310
That's funny, I didn't even
"look" in the mirror today.

154
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:54,722
That's not anything, is it?

155
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:59,412
So, I made a reservation at
San Marino tonight for 8:00.

156
00:06:59,425 --> 00:07:01,635
San Marino.

157
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:03,341
Oh, you're serious? Yikes.

158
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,782
No. We have to
try Casa A Pezzi.

159
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,966
Best salmon risotto
I have ever had.

160
00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:10,189
I love salmon risotto.

161
00:07:10,211 --> 00:07:11,971
I know.

162
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:14,692
How are we supposed to get
a table at Casa A Pezzi?

163
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:16,013
They're booked for weeks.

164
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,781
Well, lucky for you,
I happen to know the head waitress,

165
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,200
which is ironic because...

166
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:27,118
Ironic because we both work at a
homeless shelter where I serve the food.

167
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:29,542
Where do you volunteer, Robin?

168
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,171
What's the matter with you?

169
00:07:32,184 --> 00:07:34,724
I'm his girlfriend,
and I'm not even trying that hard.

170
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,774
Way to wreck the
curve, kiss-ass.

171
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,620
Robin, I'm his best friend.

172
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:39,861
That's a commitment.

173
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,519
Girlfriend, that's
like a bad flu.

174
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,620
Out of your system after
a couple weeks in bed.

175
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:46,152
High five.

176
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:47,903
Can I help?

177
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:49,512
Yes, you can, Virginia.

178
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:53,334
There's a story behind that broach,
and I'm going to hear it.

179
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,083
Well, funny you should ask.

180
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:01,753
Whoa! Bravo, Barney.

181
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:05,252
That is my all-time
favorite sonata.

182
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,981
Barney, you are
just delightful.

183
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:10,294
No, Virginia, you're delightful,
I am deligh-ted.

184
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:11,594
And he's just Ted.

185
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,750
I'm really not planning these things;
they just keep happening.

186
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,155
Whoops. I think I dropped
an ice cube down here.

187
00:08:18,177 --> 00:08:19,867
Ow, it's so cold.

188
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,440
All right, that's it,
I'm out of here.

189
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:25,965
In a minute.

190
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,510
Anyone up for a
drink at MacLaren's?

191
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:29,993
- No, I'm kind of tired.
- Me, too.

192
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,228
Yeah, I'm sure my
folks are gonna want...

193
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,150
I feel like I could knock
back a few cervezas.

194
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,022
Cervezas?

195
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:37,764
Did he fall?

196
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:41,669
I'd join you, too, but I want to
get up early for Mass tomorrow.

197
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:45,275
St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m.,
it's my favorite service.

198
00:08:45,294 --> 00:08:49,394
Wait a minute-- you're able to
cross the threshold of a church?

199
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:50,669
I'll save you a seat.

200
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:53,335
Oh, you are just terrific.

201
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:55,405
Isn't he, Susan?

202
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,039
Robin.

203
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:59,852
Susan, her name is Virginia.

204
00:09:03,657 --> 00:09:06,027
Dude, I am sincerely ticked
at your dad right now.

205
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:07,288
Why?

206
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:10,023
Last night,
we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?

207
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:12,535
So Barney darts back
into the burning house,

208
00:09:12,556 --> 00:09:14,656
lifts up the refrigerator
I'm pinned under

209
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,769
and pulls me to safety.

210
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,093
Whoa. You're like a hero.

211
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:21,274
Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy.

212
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:23,228
You know who is a hero?

213
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:25,879
My Dalmatian, Smokey.

214
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:30,501
He... didn't... make it out.

215
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:33,113
I'm sorry.

216
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:37,159
You poor, brave man.

217
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,431
Why don't you give
the guy a hug?

218
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:41,443
I'm... oh.

219
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,914
My dad was your wingman?

220
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,475
This is really
messing with my head.

221
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,390
Barney, is my dad cool?

222
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:54,021
I'm not done.

223
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,514
So, your dad stays
to finish his drink,

224
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:59,644
but I take off because I have to be
up early for Mass with your mom.

225
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:00,956
Sure.

226
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:05,412
Anyway, I realize that I left my
phone on the bar, so I come back...

227
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:10,803
Oh, my God...

228
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,111
Oh, my God.

229
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,016
Is that really...

230
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:22,617
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

231
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:26,146
Can you believe your dad
rack-jacked me like that?

232
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:32,931
My dad made out with
Wendy the waitress?

233
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:35,529
He cheated on my mom?
No, that's impossible.

234
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:38,531
Ted, it's a well-known
statistic that 83% of people

235
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:41,399
married longer than six months
are seeing someone on the side.

236
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:45,192
Do you know that when you make up
a statistic, you always use "83%"?

237
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:46,897
You think I'm lying.

238
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,971
Well, have you done any
surveys on the subject?

239
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:52,923
Because the good people at
www.swingers.open-marriage-is natural

240
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:56,549
legalize-polygamy.org have,
and they beg to differ.

241
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:57,959
That's not a real Web site.

242
00:10:57,972 --> 00:11:01,922
Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real
T-shirt for running in their 10K.

243
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:08,186
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Ted. Barney.

244
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,678
- Enjoying your vacation so far?
- Oh, yeah.

245
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,890
Uh, listen,
can I speak to you outside for a sec?

246
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:14,243
Sure.

247
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,955
So you went out with
Barney last night?

248
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:21,118
Yeah.

249
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,534
You have a good time?

250
00:11:22,538 --> 00:11:24,908
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sorry you couldn't join us.

251
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,403
Yeah.

252
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:30,487
So...

253
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:32,609
What?

254
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:34,453
Well...

255
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:37,006
Well what?

256
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:42,202
You think Cerrano's got
a shot at the RBI title?

257
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,438
I wanted to confront him,
but I couldn't.

258
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,670
I guess I got the let's-not-talk-
about-anything-uncomfortable gene

259
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,300
Well, you didn't get your dad's
close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.

260
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:52,779
Smile.

261
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:54,214
Great.

262
00:11:54,219 --> 00:11:57,649
I don't care how unpleasant it is.
You have to talk to him.

263
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,870
Not now.

264
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,645
Okay, if you don't, I will.

265
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,960
Robin...!

266
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,501
Okay, now I got to back up
all the way to the beginning

267
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:08,403
to tell you the me and
Robin part of the story.

268
00:12:09,468 --> 00:12:12,208
We were expecting my
parents at any minute.

269
00:12:12,227 --> 00:12:13,867
One last thing about my mom.

270
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:15,505
She grills every single
one of my girlfriends

271
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:17,836
about when we're gonna
get married and have kids.

272
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:19,458
But this is the first
time she's meeting me.

273
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:20,174
Doesn't matter.

274
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,650
And you'll know it's coming when
she mentions my cousin Stacy--

275
00:12:22,684 --> 00:12:24,464
six kids in five years.

276
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:27,318
The woman's basically
a ride at a water park.

277
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:30,693
But I don't want to get
married and have kids.

278
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:32,215
What am I supposed to say?

279
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,560
You know what?

280
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:36,217
You're an adult with
perfectly valid opinions.

281
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,716
You shouldn't have to
apologize for them.

282
00:12:37,753 --> 00:12:39,863
- I'm gonna lie.
- I would.

283
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:44,071
Thanks again for letting
me have the U2 box set.

284
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:46,378
I know how important
it is to you.

285
00:12:46,442 --> 00:12:48,842
I talked to Aunt
Caroline the other day.

286
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:51,022
Stacy's pregnant again.

287
00:12:51,034 --> 00:12:53,354
Oh, good for her.

288
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:55,426
- So, dear...
- Oh, boy.

289
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:57,139
Tell us what it's like
being a journalist.

290
00:12:57,153 --> 00:12:58,873
I'm just not ready.

291
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:01,287
Okay. No pressure.

292
00:13:01,312 --> 00:13:04,532
Oh. Uh, I thought you, um...

293
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:06,018
It's great.

294
00:13:06,033 --> 00:13:06,963
Good.

295
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:10,361
Focus on your job now,
because your career clock is ticking.

296
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:14,311
There's time for marriage and kids
and all that other stuff later.

297
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,779
Ooh, a piano!

298
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,567
You lucked out with my
mom last night, huh?

299
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:22,659
What a relief, right?

300
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,866
Oh, absolutely.

301
00:13:23,882 --> 00:13:25,992
Whew, what a relief it is to
know I'm the one girlfriend

302
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:28,425
your mom doesn't want
you to have kids with.

303
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:30,318
Hooray?

304
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,000
I mean, did she really think that
your college girlfriend Cheryl

305
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:35,809
would pop out
attractive children?

306
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:37,921
'Cause I've seen pictures,
and, I'm sorry,

307
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:40,715
that girl had a brow
ridge like a caveman.

308
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,455
Come on, she was just
frowning under direct light.

309
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:46,178
And besides, that's not even what
I liked about her. It was her...

310
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,076
It's not important.

311
00:13:49,824 --> 00:13:51,764
What happened to
Marshall and Lily?

312
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,219
They've been fighting lately.

313
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,353
They're probably off
somewhere going at it.

314
00:13:55,366 --> 00:13:56,566
More coffee?

315
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,653
Oh, no, thank you.

316
00:13:59,412 --> 00:14:01,642
Isn't she sweet?

317
00:14:01,653 --> 00:14:05,263
Well, if she's so sweet,
maybe she should have Ted's babies.

318
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,100
Excuse me?

319
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:08,645
Nothing.

320
00:14:14,032 --> 00:14:15,292
Just a minute.

321
00:14:15,308 --> 00:14:17,068
Maybe less.

322
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:20,421
Robin, dear.
Did I say something to upset you?

323
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:22,928
Why don't you want me
to have your grandkids?

324
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,171
Do you want to
have my grandkids?

325
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:28,243
No! I mean, I don't know.

326
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:31,662
I just... I want you to want me
to want to have your grandkids.

327
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,420
And you should.
I'm a genetic gold mine.

328
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,150
No family history of
diabetes or heart disease.

329
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:40,482
Everyone has nonporous
teeth and perfect eyesight.

330
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:44,751
I had one schizophrenic uncle,
but even he had perfect vision.

331
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,698
Which was unfortunate

332
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,310
for the people around
the bell tower he was in,

333
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:51,479
but still he was a
very fine man, and...

334
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:54,445
Excuse me. Sorry.
Didn't know that there was a line.

335
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:56,374
Marshall, your zipper.

336
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:07,278
Robin, it's not that I
don't want grandkids.

337
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,449
It's just I don't think anyone
should make the mistake

338
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,450
of getting married too young.

339
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:12,486
Why do you say that?

340
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:16,043
I mean, you got married pretty young.
That wasn't a mistake.

341
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:18,744
Was it?

342
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,238
Well...

343
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:22,383
Okay, there's something
you don't know.

344
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:24,078
Smile.

345
00:15:24,462 --> 00:15:25,832
I wish your face
would melt off.

346
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:27,404
I wish your eyeballs
would explode.

347
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:28,249
I'm gonna kill him.

348
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:30,519
I don't care how unpleasant it is,
you have to talk to him.

349
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:32,651
- Not now.
- Okay, if you don't, I will.

350
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:33,812
Robin...!

351
00:15:34,904 --> 00:15:37,764
Oh, gosh, let me help you
pick those up, sweetheart.

352
00:15:37,774 --> 00:15:39,944
Sweetheart? Sweetheart?!

353
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,618
The only sweetheart in your
life should be the woman

354
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,050
you married 30 years ago,
not the waitress at the bar last night

355
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,424
and not this clumsy floozy!

356
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:47,914
I'm sorry, you're not a floozy.

357
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:50,268
I'm upset,
I don't know what I'm saying.

358
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,811
But stay away from my dad.

359
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:55,701
Ted, what are you
talking about?

360
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:57,082
Dad?

361
00:15:57,099 --> 00:16:01,659
You, uh, want to tell Mom what
happened at the bar last night?

362
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:05,166
Okay.

363
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:07,539
I hooked up with a waitress.

364
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,471
Oh.

365
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:11,642
Oh?

366
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,510
I mean, oh!

367
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,783
Oh! Ooh!

368
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,520
We're going to have a serious talk
about this when we get home, Al.

369
00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:21,569
Oh, ooh!

370
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:23,989
Serious talk? Mom, what...?

371
00:16:24,003 --> 00:16:26,453
He was kissing another woman.
Don't you care?

372
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:28,373
Mrs. Mosby?

373
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:33,421
Ted, we weren't quite sure
how to tell you this...

374
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,160
Your mother and I are divorced.

375
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,052
What do you mean you're divorced?
Since when?

376
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:46,634
Oh, gosh,
it's been about nine months now.

377
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,043
Closer to ten, I think.

378
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,919
Time flies.

379
00:16:49,935 --> 00:16:52,535
So ten months ago,
you just up and decided

380
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:54,334
to get divorced
without telling me?

381
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:55,999
No, it wasn't a snap decision.

382
00:16:56,012 --> 00:16:58,512
We'd been separated
almost two years.

383
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:00,475
How could you not
tell me this?!

384
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,816
We meant to, it just never
seemed like the right time.

385
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:05,775
So last Christmas...?

386
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,679
We talked about
telling you kids then,

387
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,952
but it didn't seem
very Christmasy.

388
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:12,661
I got you a tandem bike.

389
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:15,947
Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother
and Frank ride it all the time.

390
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:17,385
Who the hell is Frank?!

391
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,889
Oh, great guy.
I actually set them up.

392
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:24,227
You remember Dr. Muchnik.
He did your braces.

393
00:17:27,036 --> 00:17:29,086
Okay, my head's
about to explode,

394
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:31,199
and I don't want to get it
all over everyone's waffles,

395
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:32,711
so I am leaving.

396
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:34,717
Teddy bear, oh...

397
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:41,696
You know,
he mentioned he was divorced last night.

398
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:43,477
I totally spaced on that.

399
00:17:45,043 --> 00:17:47,423
Ooh, no line at
the omelet station.

400
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,134
Lily...

401
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm sorry that I said
all those things.

402
00:17:58,307 --> 00:17:59,967
Me, too.

403
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,359
I just find it really confusing
to be around you right now.

404
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:06,078
It's the same for me.

405
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:09,137
I think we're probably
both better off trying

406
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,860
to keep some distance
for a while.

407
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:13,902
Yeah, I think you're right.

408
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,959
Are you wearing a push-up bra?

409
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:24,432
Did you Mystic Tan your calves?

410
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,370
I withdraw the question.

411
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,420
We're sorry we didn't say
anything about the divorce.

412
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,858
It was wrong not to tell you.

413
00:18:33,872 --> 00:18:35,302
Thank you.

414
00:18:35,317 --> 00:18:36,777
But listen,
don't tell your sister.

415
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,712
It would just upset her.

416
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:40,952
No, this is ridiculous!

417
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:44,295
We have to start talking about stuff,
and not just baseball.

418
00:18:44,315 --> 00:18:46,305
Indians won today on
a walk-off double.

419
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:48,698
Against the Red Sox?
Boy, that's a big win.

420
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:51,632
No. No. No.
We're not gonna blow past this.

421
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,632
I mean,
I don't even know who you people.

422
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:55,813
I don't even know how you met.

423
00:18:55,826 --> 00:18:57,506
I never told you how
I met your mother?

424
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:59,341
- No.
- Oh, great story.

425
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,875
At a bar.

426
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:04,093
That's it?

427
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:07,079
That's what passes for
communication in our family?

428
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:09,789
Man, when I have kids,
and I tell them how I met their mother,

429
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:12,929
I'm gonna tell them everything,
the whole damn story.

430
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,134
I think it was an Irish bar.

431
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,190
I just, I don't...
I don't understand.

432
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,901
You seemed so happy.

433
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,256
When I was growing up,
you seemed so...

434
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,917
What happened?

435
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:28,493
We just realized we're
very different people.

436
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,884
Your father's kind of a
head-in-the-clouds romantic,

437
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,305
and I'm much more
down to earth.

438
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:34,486
So?

439
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:37,233
Robin and I are like that.
That doesn't mean anything.

440
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,033
I wanted kids.
And your mother...

441
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:42,903
also wanted kids.

442
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,820
Robin and I have different
views on families.

443
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:47,545
We're not about to
break up because of it.

444
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:50,499
On some level, I always knew.

445
00:19:50,517 --> 00:19:52,747
I didn't even want to go out
with him in the beginning.

446
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,739
But he spent months badgering
me until I finally gave in.

447
00:19:57,614 --> 00:20:01,904
Well, when you don't connect on
that many fundamental levels,

448
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:05,811
it's only a matter of time before you
realize you're not meant to be together.

449
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,090
But we love Robin.

450
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:10,093
Absolutely.

451
00:20:10,101 --> 00:20:12,211
Meeting you was the
highlight of my trip.

452
00:20:12,222 --> 00:20:14,582
Well, second highlight.

453
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:18,362
- We'll see you inside.
- Sorry.

454
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:24,645
Wow.

455
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:26,249
I know.

456
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,652
They love me!

457
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:34,835
We are definitely going
to try and communicate more.

458
00:20:34,857 --> 00:20:36,617
From now on, full disclosure.

459
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:40,379
Good. Good, I think it'll be
really good for the family.

460
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:44,067
By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't
returned my last couple calls.

461
00:20:50,312 --> 00:20:52,872
I'm gonna get some juice.

462
00:20:54,768 --> 00:20:56,488
No.

463
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,423
No.

464
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:04,578
You missed a great game last night.
Real squeaker.
