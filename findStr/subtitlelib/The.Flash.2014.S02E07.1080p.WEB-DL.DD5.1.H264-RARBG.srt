00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:02,541
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:05,644
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:08,747
<i>To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:08,749 --> 00:00:11,716
<i>but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:15,186
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,188 --> 00:00:17,222
<i>I hunted down the man who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:20,592
<i>but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:23,995
<i>and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:26,831
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,433
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:30,035
Zoom wants me dead.

12
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:31,836
The meta-humans that he's
sending from Earth-2,

13
00:00:31,838 --> 00:00:33,305
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

14
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:34,673
I have to go.

15
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:37,042
I need you to tell me that it's okay.

16
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:38,510
- Ah!
- Barry.

17
00:00:38,512 --> 00:00:43,548
Is this the face of your
hero, Central City?

18
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,786
- Ah!
- Ah!

19
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:49,487
Seriously got your ass kicked.

20
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:51,256
I can't feel my legs.

21
00:00:59,566 --> 00:01:00,565
All right, I got you.

22
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,867
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

23
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:10,909
I can't do it right now, all right?

24
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:14,479
- Oh, yes you can, Barry.
- No, no, no.

25
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:16,114
We've been making so much progress.

26
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:17,148
Yep, six whole steps.

27
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,650
Someone get me a Bozo button.

28
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:20,151
Hey, give yourself some credit.

29
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:21,720
You just broke your back.

30
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:23,288
Yeah, a normal person
would've been paralyzed

31
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,689
the rest of his life.

32
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:26,925
How long until I'm fully healed?

33
00:01:26,927 --> 00:01:28,627
The initial MRI I took a week ago

34
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:32,397
showed a complete dislocation
at the T12-L1 interspace

35
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,499
of the thoracolumbar junction.

36
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,168
But this is the MRI I took this morning.

37
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,904
It's remarkable, but you're
almost completely healed.

38
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:41,539
I'm still having trouble breathing.

39
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:44,142
That's totally normal with a spinal injury.

40
00:01:44,144 --> 00:01:46,611
It should clear up soon.

41
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:50,315
We're going to get you
back in that suit, Barry.

42
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:53,084
Real quick, trust me.

43
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:55,453
What are we gonna do about Zoom?

44
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:58,289
No sign of him since Cisco
nailed him with that tranq dart.

45
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,225
And I haven't vibed since then.

46
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:04,529
- Maybe Zoom's not coming back.
- I highly doubt that.

47
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:06,464
Which is why I'm gonna go do
something about it.

48
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,533
What do you mean, go do something about it?

49
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:11,936
I need access to your breach
room and your speed cannon.

50
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:13,405
Why is that?

51
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:16,841
Because, Barry, it's time to go home.

00:02:23,249 --> 00:02:26,751
So, you show up on our Earth,
you screw everything up,

54
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,319
and now you want to go home?

55
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,154
Sounds very familiar.

56
00:02:30,156 --> 00:02:33,257
Again, that wasn't me.

57
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:36,527
I need to go take care of Zoom
once and for all

58
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:37,996
before anyone else gets killed.

59
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:39,163
How do you plan on doing that?

60
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:40,732
I'll think of something.

61
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:42,400
Ramon, if you'll escort me
to the speed cannon.

62
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:43,835
No, no, you can't go through the breach.

63
00:02:43,837 --> 00:02:44,969
Yeah, he can.

64
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,037
Jay taught us how to send people.

65
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,438
That's not what I mean.

66
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,073
Look, if you can figure
out how to stop Zoom

67
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,609
on your Earth, you can
figure out how to do it here.

68
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:55,880
We need you to stay here until
we defeat Zoom, Dr. Wells.

69
00:02:55,882 --> 00:03:00,051
What I need, Dr. Snow, is to return home.

70
00:03:00,053 --> 00:03:04,222
And I'm going to that with
or without your assistance.

71
00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:09,961
What are you doing?
If Harry wants to go... bye.

72
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:12,430
Look, like it or not, Cisco,
we need his help.

73
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:15,466
I'm not sure another plan
from Wells is what we need.

74
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:17,301
Yeah, I mean, the last bright idea he had

75
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:18,403
nearly got Barry killed.

76
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:20,304
I know, but Jay's gone,

77
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:22,573
and Dr. Wells knows Zoom
better than anyone,

78
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:26,210
so until Barry is back on his feet again,

79
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:29,147
we need to keep Wells around
in case Zoom returns.

80
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,950
Caitlin, if he doesn't want to be here,

81
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:33,118
then we're better off without him.

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,285
Let him go.

83
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:37,155
I can't do that. Not yet.

00:03:54,574 --> 00:03:56,841
With the lovely Kendra Saunders,

91
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:58,309
the barista at Jitters.

92
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:00,111
Oh, she makes a mean latte.

93
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:02,180

for dinner and a movie,

94
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:04,182
and then, I don't know,
maybe some breakfast.

95
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,518
- [laughs]
- Wait, breakfast?

96
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,053
Why breakfast? I don't...

00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:11,756

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,162
- He's messing with you.
- Go.

125
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:32,570

without the consent

00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:34,906
of the rest of your fabulous team.

00:05:34,908 --> 00:05:37,108

134
00:05:57,931 --> 00:06:00,331
And use that help to stop Zoom,
and my plan failed.

135
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,900
I don't have another plan,

136
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:06,171
except to go back home
and face Zoom myself.

137
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,939
So let's say you go back to your Earth,

138
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,641
and you fight Zoom.

139
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:11,276
He will kill you.

140
00:06:11,278 --> 00:06:14,746
And then, how does that help your daughter?

00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:17,549
Look, the best way to save Jesse

142
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:21,486
is for you to stay here,
and work with us as a team.

143
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,055
No.

144
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:25,924
Now, please leave me

145
00:06:25,926 --> 00:06:29,594
which one of these breaches
is gonna get me home.

00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,429
You know, you're lucky
Cisco and Professor Stein

147
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:33,431
never figured out how to close
all the breaches,

148
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:37,635
'cause then you'd be stuck here.

149
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:41,039
Wait.

150
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:44,409
We close the breaches.

151
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:45,844
All of them, except one,

152
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:50,014
so Zoom only has one way
to get to this world.

153
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:56,688
- The breach at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Exactly.

154
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,590
And then we set a trap.

155
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:02,827
It's got fencing, fighting,
torture, revenge,

156
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:07,565
giants, monsters, chases, escapes,

157
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:11,336
true love, miracles, and,

158
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:14,672
it's ranked as one of the best
date movies of all time.

159
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:18,843
Well, let's see if that's true.

00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:28,513
You can't take that out of here.

00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:30,315
Ah!

[heavy breathing]

180
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,695

- [guttural grunting]</i>

182

187

What'd you find?

188
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:16,489
Found these weird-looking
hairs all over the street.

189
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:17,790
I'm gonna run 'em against the database

190
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:19,158
and see what I can find.

191
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,093
Uh, here, our victim.

192
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,162
His name's Dr. Jeffrey Shore.

193
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:25,870
He's a biochemistry engineer
here at Vaughan Pharmaceuticals.

194
00:09:25,872 --> 00:09:28,273
This is the second dead
lab tech in two weeks.

195
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:29,474
That ain't a coincidence.

196
00:09:29,476 --> 00:09:31,109
Yeah, and like the other tech,

197
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,678
he had just stolen a serum
from their storage cooler.

198
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
- Really? What kind of serum?
- It's called Cortexin.

199
00:09:35,682 --> 00:09:37,348
It's used to treat encephalopathy,

200
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,350
a blood disease in the brain.

201
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,786
The serum's missing, but
his colleagues found him here

202
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:42,987
a couple of minutes later, dead.

203
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:44,455
He didn't get far.

204
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,524
He died from blunt force
trauma to the head.

205
00:09:46,526 --> 00:09:48,927
Ugh, and apparently a lot of it.

206
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,796
Yeah, check this out.

207
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:54,566
- Is that his blood?
- Point of impact.

208
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:56,234
Okay.

209
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,837
Can you run through what you told me to her

210
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,138
and see if you can get anything else,

211
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,372
and if the cases are linked?

212
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,842
Sure thing.

213
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:05,443
- Hi.
- Some of the evidence.

214
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:08,479
I'll be right with you. Uh, Detective?

215
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,548

216
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,517
Oh, heading to see him right now.

217
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,785
He asked me to bring him

218
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,854
some of my homemade chicken noodle soup.

219
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:19,023
He hates that canned stuff.

220
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:22,060
Don't we all.

221
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:31,402

222

229

It's nothing. I'm good, all right?

230
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:03,835
- Just forget it.
- Barry.

231
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:05,336
Talk to us. We can help you.

232
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:07,105
No, you can't help me.

233
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:10,275
Not this time. I'm sorry.

234
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:13,311
You just... you wouldn't understand.

- [sighs]

237
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:32,730
Zoom destroyed me.

238
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:35,033
He showed everyone in
Central City what he could do,

239
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:37,502
and that I'm powerless to stop him.

240
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:39,137
They gave me a key to this city, Joe.

241
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,772
I'm supposed to be their hero.

242
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:43,675
I'm supposed to be the guy
that can protect them

243
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:45,777
from something as evil
as that, and I failed

244
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,180

246
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,163
When they think of the Flash,
all they see now

247
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:08,766
is someone not strong enough
to protect them.

248
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,771
- Hey.
- I'm good.

249
00:12:21,247 --> 00:12:22,814
Oh, hey, I know I keep asking,

250
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:26,551
but have you read any reports
or anything recently

251
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:29,287
about a Birdman attacking anywhere?

252
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,389
There's no such thing as a Birdman, Cisco.

253
00:12:31,391 --> 00:12:34,559
Okay, like that's a stretch. In this city?

254
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,527
Look, I know what I vibed.

255
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:41,065
It was a man with these big, wide wings.

256
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:44,502
It was crazy.

257
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:46,738
What if it was an angel?

258
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,307
[laughs]

259
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:52,910
It was an angel.

00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:55,146
Caitlin?

261
00:12:55,148 --> 00:13:00,218
Okay, come on, like that's a crazy idea.

262
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,652
Ah!

263
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:06,657

264
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,593
Just don't know what to do about Barry.

265
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:11,295
I mean, all the test results say he's fine,

266
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:13,798
but it's like there's
something holding him back.

267
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,035
I keep trying to talk to him,
but I can't get through.

268
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:19,203
Then maybe we should get
the person who can.

<i>[phone vibrates]</i>

270
00:13:21,141 --> 00:13:22,673

Turns out our dead scientist
cases are linked.

275
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:30,048
Okay, hit me.

276
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,316
Well, the other scientist
stole a large quantity

277
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:33,751
of a racetam drug,

278
00:13:33,753 --> 00:13:35,586
typically used to treat
patients with Vertigo.

279
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:37,321
Okay, so we got two stolen drugs,

280
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:39,123
one for blood disorders of the brain,

281
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:41,325
and the other one for Vertigo.
What's the connection?

282
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:43,294
Well, they are both nootropic drugs,

283
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:44,929
used to enhance intelligence.

284
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:47,098
Hey, did you get results

285
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,233
Yes, I did.

286
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:52,336
Uh, apparently they were all
over the other crime scene too.

287
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:55,373
The weird thing is,
they're not human hairs.

288
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,310
Uh, they're hairs from a... From a gorilla.

289
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:02,046
- How... How did you know?
- Patty, I gotta go.

290
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:04,682
But... Uh...

291
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,791
Did Caitlin come through here?

292
00:14:13,793 --> 00:14:15,226
No.

293
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:18,496
She just hit me in the face and ran away.

294
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:20,398
Yo!

- What?

296
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:24,302
- Grodd's back.
- Caitlin.

297
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:25,503
That must be why she was acting like that.

298
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:28,106
She was being mind-controlled.

Ramon, why would this
Grodd abduct Dr. Snow?

305
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:03,972
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense.

306
00:15:03,974 --> 00:15:05,707
She was always so nice to him.

307
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,575
He mind-controlled two lab technicians

308
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:09,477
to steal chemicals
that enhance intelligence.

309
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,279
He wants her for something.

310
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:14,082
Well, looks like he left
his bachelor pad in the sewers.

311
00:15:14,084 --> 00:15:15,817
Grodd's a big-ass gorilla.

312
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:17,685
He can't just waltz through downtown

Right, and if there's been sightings,

315
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:23,391
then we might be able to
approximate his location.

316
00:15:23,393 --> 00:15:24,592
I can call CCPD.

317
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:26,060
They can access the tip hotline,

00:15:26,062 --> 00:15:27,762
send over files of Grodd's recent attacks.

00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:29,764

00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:17,932
[heavy breathing]

358
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:22,537
Keep that chin down, slugger.

359
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,572
Dad.

360
00:18:28,712 --> 00:18:30,945
Yeah.

361
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:44,292
That was a hell of an idea
you had, bringing Henry here.

362
00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:45,793
Well, he may not have his mother,

363
00:18:45,795 --> 00:18:48,129
but he's got two amazing fathers.

364
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:49,297
Seemed like he needed both.

365
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:52,300
Hmm.

366
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:55,069
- Good girl.
- Mm.

367
00:18:57,073 --> 00:18:59,374
So how did Grodd become sentient?

368
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:01,509
A few years ago, S.T.A.R. Labs
had this contract

369
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:03,578
with the military to research and awaken

370
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,315
latent mind-reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

371
00:19:07,317 --> 00:19:09,717
And I'm guessing Grodd is
one of the test subjects?

372
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,753
Right, but then Dr. Wells
shut down the program,

373
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:13,521
and we all thought it was to save Grodd

374
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:17,058
from all the crazy
mind-control experiments,

375
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,560
but it was really so that
Dr. Wells could use

376
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:20,962
the accelerator explosion to create

377
00:19:20,964 --> 00:19:22,930
a 1,500-pound mind-controlling gorilla

378
00:19:22,932 --> 00:19:25,700
that he could manipulate.

379
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,070
What kind of algorithm is that?

380
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:31,572
It's an algorithm meant to
extrapolate Grodd's location

381
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:35,209
from places we know he's already been.

382
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:40,848
Hello.

383
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,517
There we have it.

384
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,485
No spinal cord edema.

385
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,421
I don't see any subacute hemorrhaging.

386
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:50,958
Bone fused beautifully.
You're all good, Barry.

387
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,427
I'd give you some physical therapy,

388
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:56,030
but you don't need it.

389
00:19:56,032 --> 00:19:57,398
I'm really glad you're here, Dad.

390
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,167
Me too.

391
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,269
You know, I tried to call,
but you can't get a cell

392
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:03,304
in Granite Peak National Park, so...

393
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:04,672
Granite Peak... what are you...

394
00:20:04,674 --> 00:20:06,441
You went camping by yourself?

395
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:09,477
Yeah, yeah, I got a tent.
I went fishing every day.

396
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:12,980
I have had my fill of
largemouth bass for a while.

397
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:14,549
[both chuckle]

398
00:20:16,052 --> 00:20:20,621
Sometimes you just have to slow down

399
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:24,292
to get back to where you want to be.

400
00:20:24,294 --> 00:20:27,662
- Yeah. Look, Dad...
- Hey, guys.

401
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:29,497
I think we've found them.

402
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:30,998
Yeah?

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,801
Grodd has to be in one of
these three bell towers.

404
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:35,269
The only reason we couldn't find him

405
00:20:35,271 --> 00:20:37,071
on any cameras underneath
the city before is

406
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:38,739
'cause he upgraded from a bachelor pad

407
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:40,842
to a penthouse, like a baller.

408
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:42,176
Okay, so we know where he is.

409
00:20:42,178 --> 00:20:43,644
We still don't know how to get her.

410
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:45,580
- We got a plan for you.
- What's the plan?

411
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:47,415
We use me.

412
00:20:48,351 --> 00:20:50,184
[grunts]

413
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:51,719
That's Harry! That's the other Wells!

414
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:53,488
- Barry.
- Let him go.

415
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,190
Let him go.

416
00:20:56,192 --> 00:20:57,558
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

417
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,227
We found another suit in the Time Vault.

418
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:00,828
- I thought he was dead.
- He's dead.

419
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,598
This is... this is Harrison Wells
from Earth-2.

420
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,299
- Earth-2?
- I'll explain later.

421
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:07,001
If we can get Harry to convince Grodd

422
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:09,270
that he's Wells, that he's his father,

423
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:12,607
maybe we can convince
him to let Caitlin go.

424
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,646
I'm not gonna be able to help
if anything goes wrong.

425
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:21,916
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

426
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:29,128
Looks like we're 0 for 2 on
the bell towers, huh?

427
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:30,682
I like to think of it more as,

428
00:21:30,684 --> 00:21:33,018
now we know exactly where they are.

429
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,619
Okay, let's do this again.
Gimme your best Wells.

430
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:36,021
I'm not doing the Wells again, Ramon.

431
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:37,522
- I told you...
- Look.

432
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:40,025
I just made these
anti-mind-control ear buds.

433
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:42,327
They could fail, and
if they do, you're toast,

434
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:44,162
so you're gonna need to nail it
if you want to live.

435
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:47,599
[sighs] Ramon.

436
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:51,436
- Cisco.
- Cisco.

437
00:21:51,438 --> 00:21:55,807
In many ways, you've shown me
what it's like to have a son.

438
00:21:56,743 --> 00:21:58,243
What?

439
00:21:58,245 --> 00:22:01,646
Okay, let's... Let's just try it again.

440
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:04,850
This time, up the creep
factor, like, a lot more,

441
00:22:04,852 --> 00:22:08,120
and make it a little more sincere.

442
00:22:08,122 --> 00:22:09,588
Like you really love me,

443
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,291
but you're gonna have to kill me anyway.

444
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:16,461
Cisco.

445
00:22:16,463 --> 00:22:18,396
In many ways,

446
00:22:18,398 --> 00:22:23,301
you've shown me what
it's like to have a son.

447
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:26,771
Yup, that's the one. Here you go.

448
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:28,807
<i>[phone rings]</i>

449
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:30,509
Yo.

450
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:32,511
Yeah, we're moving
on to the third location.

451
00:22:32,513 --> 00:22:34,813
Copy that.

452
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:36,948
Now we wait.

453
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,917
So this is what it's like

454
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:41,887
every time you go after
one of those meta-humans?

455
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:43,855
Uh, pretty much.

456
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:45,957
Only, Cisco and Caitlin are
normally the ones in here

457
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:47,526
and I'm the one out there.

458
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:50,195
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't be.

459
00:22:50,197 --> 00:22:53,298
Iris showed me what happened.

460
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,967
With Zoom?

461
00:22:55,969 --> 00:22:57,702
That was hard to watch.

462
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:01,573
I can only imagine what that
must have been like for you.

463
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,177
He showed everyone in Central City

464
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,181
that their hero wasn't
good enough to stop him.

465
00:23:09,183 --> 00:23:11,883
Well, that's certainly what it looked like.

466
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:13,151
Was he right?

467
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:14,419
[scoffs]

468
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:15,987
Your body's healed, Barry,

469
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:19,257
and yet here you are,

470
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:22,394
feeling the shame of losing.

471
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,463
I can't stop him.

472
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:28,133
I know it. He knows it.

473
00:23:28,135 --> 00:23:32,270
And now everyone in this city knows it too.

474
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:34,739
They don't believe in me anymore, Dad.

475
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:36,441
At my trial for your mother's death,

476
00:23:36,443 --> 00:23:38,944
a lot of our family and friends
were in the courtroom.

477
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:43,148
They heard awful things about
what I had done to your mother.

478
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,317
It didn't matter that it wasn't true.

479
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,152
Every day, I could see it on their faces,

480
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:49,487
the moment when I lost them,

481
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:53,258
until everybody had
stopped believing in me.

482
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,060
Well, that was my reality.

483
00:23:55,062 --> 00:23:57,195
You know, I was gonna serve a life sentence

484
00:23:57,197 --> 00:23:59,831
for a crime I didn't commit,
but worse than that,

485
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:01,466
every time I looked at someone in the eye

486
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:02,834
from that moment forward,
they were gonna believe

487
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:07,105
that I had killed the woman I loved

488
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:12,510
in front of our son.

489
00:24:12,512 --> 00:24:15,914
So yeah, I do know what it's like

490
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:21,519
being destroyed.

491
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:24,756
How did you get past that?

492
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:26,658
I embraced it.

493
00:24:29,229 --> 00:24:31,796
Accepting it was the only way
that I could move forward,

494
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:35,734
but I know that if I could survive that,

495
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:37,736
and learn to believe in myself again,

496
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:41,740
then I could survive anything.

497
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:44,643
You know what lit that belief in me, Barry?

498
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:47,479
You.

499
00:24:47,481 --> 00:24:49,748
11-year-old you, running around,
believing in me,

500
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,084
gave me that hope.

501
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:00,892
And now I'm giving it back to you, son.

502
00:25:00,894 --> 00:25:04,929
No more monsters can take that from us.

503
00:25:11,738 --> 00:25:14,072
So, one of the main differences

504
00:25:14,074 --> 00:25:16,975
between ape and human brains

505
00:25:16,977 --> 00:25:20,011
is the white matter and
connectivity in the brain cells.

506
00:25:20,013 --> 00:25:21,413
[grunts]

507
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:23,081
The chemicals that you were treated with

508
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,717
as an infant were meant
to overcome those differences

509
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:28,787
and cause an explosive growth of both,

510
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:30,255
similar to what humans experience

511
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:32,624
in their first few years of life.

512
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:34,526
Maybe these chemicals can be used

513
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:36,695
to duplicate that growth,
and then we won't need

514
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:38,863
a particle accelerator explosion.

515
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:42,033
[growls]

516
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,107
- Hey, buddy.
- [growls]

517
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:52,844
Easy, buddy. It's me.

518
00:25:54,314 --> 00:25:55,580
I'm back.

519
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:58,983
<i>Father, you died.</i>

520
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:01,553
No.

521
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:04,622
No, buddy, I didn't die.

522
00:26:04,624 --> 00:26:06,958
I just went away for a while.

523
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,229
All right, that's great,
Wells, keep talking.

524
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:15,600
But now that I'm back,

525
00:26:15,602 --> 00:26:20,238
we don't need Caitlin
anymore, do we, buddy?

526
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,840
So you can let her go.

527
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:24,409
[growls]

528
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:27,412
Come on, buddy.

529
00:26:28,682 --> 00:26:32,384
Let me get her out of here.

530
00:26:32,386 --> 00:26:35,186
Please.

531
00:26:35,188 --> 00:26:40,392
<i>Father never ask. Father take.</i>

532
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:41,826
Run.

533
00:26:41,828 --> 00:26:44,129
[roars]

534
00:26:44,131 --> 00:26:46,998
<i>Who are you?</i>

535
00:26:48,201 --> 00:26:50,869
Cisco, you gotta get in there, man.

536
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:53,271
[roars]

537
00:26:53,273 --> 00:26:54,606
Oh, Cisco, thank God.

538
00:26:54,608 --> 00:26:56,241
Okay, you guys gotta get out of there.

539
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:57,575
Harry's trapped. We can't leave him here.

540
00:26:57,577 --> 00:27:00,311
What do we do?

541
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:03,014
The drugs. The drugs that Grodd stole.

542
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:05,417
Wells... an overdose of those
drugs will shock his brain.

543
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:07,952
Okay, just hit him with as much as you can.

544
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:11,656
<i>You are not him! You are not Father!</i>

545
00:27:11,658 --> 00:27:15,126
- I am father.
- [growls]

546
00:27:15,128 --> 00:27:19,864
And you hit father.

547
00:27:19,866 --> 00:27:22,434
Grodd.

548
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,074
Look at me.

549
00:27:30,076 --> 00:27:33,578
- Look at me!
- [roars]

550
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:40,151
I would never leave you here alone.

551
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:43,655
Grodd, I made you a promise.

552
00:27:45,926 --> 00:27:51,696
I have bigger plans for you. Remember?

553
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:56,935
One day, this city will be yours.

554
00:27:56,937 --> 00:28:00,305
I promised you.

555
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:02,974
I intend to honor that promise.

556
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:05,510
[growls]

557
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:08,179
[roars]

558
00:28:08,181 --> 00:28:10,915
Go!

559
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:14,085
[growls]

560
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:18,790
Come on.

561
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:31,776
- Thank you.
- Thank you for rescuing me.

562
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:35,279
Well, we're a team, right?

563
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:38,554
I'm impressed. I think we all are.

564
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:40,989
Yeah, well, we need to do
something about Grodd.

565
00:28:40,991 --> 00:28:43,792
- Like what?
- Like get rid of him for good.

566
00:28:43,794 --> 00:28:45,027
You want to kill him?

567
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:47,095
Considering how many
people he's killed, yeah.

568
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:48,729
This isn't Grodd's fault.

569
00:28:48,731 --> 00:28:51,031
He's only like this because
Wells made him this way.

570
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:53,600
Yes, but, Catie, he kidnapped
you and you could have died.

571
00:28:53,602 --> 00:28:55,803
You didn't see what I saw.

572
00:28:55,805 --> 00:28:58,105
Grodd's getting smarter.

573
00:28:58,107 --> 00:29:00,174
He's lonely and sad.

574
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,709
He wants more apes like him.

575
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:03,477
What are you saying? He wants kids?

576
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:05,512
'Cause I'm pretty sure
one telepathic Grape Ape

577
00:29:05,514 --> 00:29:08,215
is more than enough for this city.

578
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,217
I know somewhere we could send him.

579
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:11,986
What are you talking about?

580
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:14,788
When the singularity exploded
and I discovered the breach

581
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,958
in S.T.A.R. Labs, I ran similar tests

582
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,862
and discovered the same thing,
51 additional breaches.

583
00:29:21,864 --> 00:29:24,131
The difference being
the breaches in Central City

584
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,799
are scattered all throughout the city

585
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:28,669
whereas counterparts in my world
most definitely are not.

586
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:30,237
And you know where they lead?

587
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:33,073
Well, I was in the process
of figuring all that out

588
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:35,609
when Dr. Snow so gallantly
convinced me to stay,

589
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:39,346
but if I am correct,
this breach is gonna get Grodd

590
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:41,815
as close to home as he's
ever likely to get.

591
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:44,952
Okay, even if you're right,

592
00:29:44,954 --> 00:29:48,522
how do we bait Grodd to go through it?

593
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:51,191
My son'll do it.

594
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:53,660
Won't you, Flash?

595
00:30:02,838 --> 00:30:05,372
Grodd?

596
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:09,543
<i>Caitlin.</i>

597
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:19,686
<i>Flash.</i>

598
00:30:19,688 --> 00:30:21,188
You want Caitlin, Grodd,

599
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:25,559
you're gonna have to catch me first.

600
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:28,495
[growls]

601
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:45,212
So Barry's gonna lure Grodd
in front of the breach?

602
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:47,181
Yep, and once he gets
him to the right spot,

603
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:49,950
Cisco's gonna blast him into
Earth-2 with his thingamajig.

604
00:30:49,952 --> 00:30:52,352
- [laughs] Speed cannon.
- Exactly.

605
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:55,322
Well, things have gotten
a lot more complicated

606
00:30:55,324 --> 00:30:56,957
since I got out of prison.

607
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:59,293
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, you have no idea.

608
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:01,728
Cisco, almost there. Are you ready?

609
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,230
I'm in position.

610
00:31:03,232 --> 00:31:05,466
Now, once you turn on the speed cannon,

611
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:07,034
the quark matter will stabilize,

612
00:31:07,036 --> 00:31:08,535
stretching the breach about so big,

613
00:31:08,537 --> 00:31:12,706
so anywhere within this
circle will suffice.

614
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:23,750
Right on time.

615
00:31:23,752 --> 00:31:25,352
Okay, come on.

616
00:31:25,354 --> 00:31:29,957
I don't have eyes on Grodd.
Does anyone see him?

617
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:32,059
[roars]

618
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,562
That is a big gorilla.

619
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:39,133
<i>Where is Caitlin?</i>

620
00:31:40,536 --> 00:31:43,437
[chokes] Ah!

621
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,771
[roars]

622
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:46,306
- Oh, my God.
- Get up, Barry.

623
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:49,276
- Ah!
- [growls]

624
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,246
<i>Where is Caitlin, Flash?</i>

625
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:53,614
[grunts]

626
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:54,815
Right here.

627
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:57,017
No. No, no, no.

628
00:31:57,019 --> 00:31:59,019
You need to let him go, Grodd.

629
00:31:59,021 --> 00:32:01,255
<i>Flash is my enemy.</i>

630
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:05,025
- <i>Now you, too.</i>
- No.

631
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:08,262
He was trying to save me from you.

632
00:32:08,264 --> 00:32:09,897
We didn't understand what you wanted,

633
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,166
but now we do.

634
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:18,605
I can give you what you want.
I can give you a home.

635
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:21,675
You just have to trust me.

636
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,581
[gasping and coughing]

637
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:29,816
All right, here he comes.

638
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:36,323
[grunts]

639
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:40,460
Ready to flip the switch.

640
00:32:40,462 --> 00:32:42,596
Now, Barry.

641
00:32:51,473 --> 00:32:53,840
[roars]

642
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:56,710
- Full power.
- It is.

643
00:32:56,712 --> 00:32:59,913
[roars]

644
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:11,091
Barry, you can't let Grodd get free.

645
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:14,561
Conquer your fears, son.
Believe in yourself.

646
00:33:35,684 --> 00:33:38,352
Come on, come on, come on.

647
00:33:45,094 --> 00:33:46,893
[exhales]

648
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:49,997
[heavy breathing]

649
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,167
[laughter]

650
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,701
Welcome back, Flash.

651
00:34:05,551 --> 00:34:07,168
Thanks, bro.

652
00:34:14,713 --> 00:34:17,914
I can't believe something good
finally came from that suit.

653
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:19,416
First and the last time.

654
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:21,184
That thing still gives me the creeps.

655
00:34:21,186 --> 00:34:22,786
We should destroy it.

656
00:34:22,788 --> 00:34:24,855
Let's do that, but see
if you can figure out

657
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:26,490
how to get it back in this ring first.

658
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:28,091
Might be nice to have something like that

659
00:34:28,093 --> 00:34:29,593
instead of carrying around
a bag all the time.

660
00:34:29,595 --> 00:34:32,896
I can help you with that.

661
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:34,364
What?

662
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:36,233
I know a thing or two
about micro-technology.

663
00:34:36,235 --> 00:34:38,635
Yeah, you know a thing or two
about a lot of things.

664
00:34:38,637 --> 00:34:40,704
Well, as long as what he knows keeps my son

665
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:44,207
and these good people safe,
the more you know, the better.

666
00:34:44,209 --> 00:34:47,177
Pleasure to meet you, Harrison. Again.

667
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,646
Dr. Allen.

668
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:52,382
Good to see you. Cisco.

669
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:55,185
- Let's go.
- Take care.

670
00:34:55,187 --> 00:34:57,354
So, Dr. Wells, this place on your Earth

671
00:34:57,356 --> 00:35:01,124
that we've sent Grodd, what is it exactly?

672
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:06,029
It's a refuge where gorillas
subjected to lab experiments,

673
00:35:06,031 --> 00:35:07,181
like Grodd,

674
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:13,737
can roam freely.

675
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:14,938
I know it's for the best,

676
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,740
but I still feel like I betrayed him.

677
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:20,677
No, don't say that. You didn't betray him.

678
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:23,914
You gave him a better life.

679
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,416
I still don't understand, though, I...

680
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,752
Why do the breaches on our Earth

681
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,887
lead to different places on yours?

682
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:34,491
I don't know yet, Ramon,

683
00:35:34,493 --> 00:35:36,726
but I do know we have to close them all,

684
00:35:36,728 --> 00:35:38,195
and I don't know how to do that.

685
00:35:38,197 --> 00:35:40,497
You don't have to do it alone anymore.

686
00:35:40,499 --> 00:35:42,199
Any of it.

687
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:46,169
Together, we defeated Grodd,
and if we stay that way,

688
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:48,305
we will figure out
how to close the breaches,

689
00:35:48,307 --> 00:35:51,908
get Zoom, and get you your daughter back.

690
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:55,979
Thank you.

691
00:35:58,317 --> 00:36:01,952
Oh, this one is definitely a keeper.

692
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,954
[laughs] Oh, yeah.

693
00:36:03,956 --> 00:36:07,090
He could've done your standard
vinegar and baking soda volcano,

694
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:10,860
but no, Barry wanted to do
a molecular structure

695
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:12,495
of chocolate and nougat.

696
00:36:12,497 --> 00:36:14,564
- Mm-hmm.
- That's my favorite candy bar.

697
00:36:14,566 --> 00:36:15,732
Who does that in the sixth grade?

698
00:36:15,734 --> 00:36:19,069
Why, a true science nerd.

699
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:22,639
Like father, like son, I suppose.

700
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:24,274
All right, Dad, we should get going.

701
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:26,176
Yeah. Uh, Joe, can I have...

702
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:29,112
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

703
00:36:29,114 --> 00:36:32,482
Iris, thank you so much
for reaching out to me.

704
00:36:32,484 --> 00:36:37,387
I am so glad you did. Me, too.

705
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:41,124
Joe, there are no words, man.

706
00:36:43,595 --> 00:36:45,295
Thanks.

707
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:47,998
All right, I'm gonna swing by
my lab before I come home.

708
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,268
Which reminds me... Patty?
She's a smart girl.

709
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,536
She's not buying your
whole sick story, FYI.

710
00:36:53,538 --> 00:36:55,372
- All right.
- Patty?

711
00:36:55,374 --> 00:36:57,574
Would this be a new girlfriend?

712
00:36:57,576 --> 00:37:00,543
Uh, yeah, something like that, yeah.

713
00:37:00,545 --> 00:37:03,046
We'll talk about it on the way
to the bus station.

714
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:05,081
Come on.

715
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:09,085
- Bye.
- See ya.

716
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:16,526
You okay?

717
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:19,829
[sighs] It's embarrassing.
I... I love Barry

718
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:24,467
like he's my own son, but
when I'm reminded that he isn't,

719
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:26,369
I start to wonder what
it would've been like

720
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:28,571
if, you know...

721
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:30,273
Dad, you would've been just as amazing

722
00:37:30,275 --> 00:37:34,277
with your own son, just like
you were with me and Barry.

723
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,359
I hear you've been spending
a lot of time up here.

724
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:52,629
[chuckles] Well, you know what they say.

725
00:37:52,631 --> 00:37:55,265
When the CSI's away...

726
00:37:55,267 --> 00:37:57,867
It's good to see you on your feet again.

727
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:00,770
Must've been all that canned soup you had.

728
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:05,608
Or maybe the homemade
stuff Joe brought you?

729
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,478
It... yeah, I wasn't actually sick, Patty.

730
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,114
Yeah, I figured that out.

731
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,088
Why did you lie to me?

732
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,489
My dad was in town.

733
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:21,658
I needed to spend some time with him.

734
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,095
And you couldn't just tell me that?

735
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:29,933
You gotta understand, Patty,
my dad was convicted of murder.

736
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:32,235
When someone's image has been
tarnished like that,

737
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:35,572
it's hard for some people to see past it.

738
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,941
And you seriously think
I'm one of those people?

739
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:40,877
No, I know, I should've
given you more credit.

740
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:43,947
No, you should've given
yourself more credit.

741
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,782
This isn't about your father, Barry.

742
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,752
This is about you.

743
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:53,556
I need to know that I can trust
you if we're gonna do this.

744
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:59,195
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

745
00:38:59,197 --> 00:39:00,930
I can tell.

746
00:39:00,932 --> 00:39:04,167
You cannot always be a smart ass.

750
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,191
I didn't know if you liked
flowers or chocolate,

751
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:31,628
so... I got you both.

752
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,797
Well, I'm allergic to chocolate,

753
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:37,500
and I think that flowers
are a waste of money.

754
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:41,237
Um... I have lollipops in my car?

755
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:44,274
- Cisco, I'm joking.
- Oh, God.

756
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:47,510
[laughs] This is great. Thank you.

757
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:50,313
Listen, I wanted to come over here

758
00:39:50,315 --> 00:39:54,584
and say I'm sorry for
bailing the other night.

759
00:39:54,586 --> 00:39:58,521
I... I'm a liaison with the CCPD
and there was an emergency,

760
00:39:58,523 --> 00:39:59,489
and I had to be there.

761
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:01,658
- The CCPD?
- Yeah.

762
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:05,728
Wow, that's really cool. And very brave.

763
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,096
Thank you.

764
00:40:07,098 --> 00:40:12,068
And this is very, very sweet, Cisco.

765
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:14,971
Um, what is this?

766
00:40:14,973 --> 00:40:16,673
- Well, see, that right there.
- Mm-hmm?

767
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:18,975
That's a digital movie projector.

768
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:21,845
I loaded all of "Princess Bride" on there.

769
00:40:21,847 --> 00:40:23,546
- [laughs]
- Mm-hmm, that's right.

770
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:26,149
So, all we need is a wall, or, you know,

771
00:40:26,151 --> 00:40:31,187
some place where we can pick up
our date where we left off.

772
00:40:31,189 --> 00:40:36,993
Well, if we're gonna pick up
right where we left it...

773
00:40:53,278 --> 00:40:55,378
Whoa.

774
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,781
Whoa what? What's wrong?

775
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,554
Nothing.

776

- Let's go watch "Princess Bride."
- Let's.

779
00:41:16,368 --> 00:41:18,635
There's a great wall up on the roof.
