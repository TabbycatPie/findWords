1
00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:01,874
Your Uncle Barney was always
always a bit of an enigma.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,720
In all the years we
lived in New York,

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,430
none of us had ever set
foot in his apartment.

4
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:09,597
Until one day, one of us did.

5
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:14,002
It's a pretty good story.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,884
And believe it or not,
alcohol did not play a role.

7
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:19,703
It all started two weeks
earlier at Lily's housewarming.

8
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,193
Hey, welcome to my new home.

9
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:24,964
Oh, wow, Lily, this is...

10
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:27,218
Oh, this is all of it.

11
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,870
Yeah, I know it's small,
but it's got character.

12
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:30,626
Thank you.

13
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:34,141
And I am learning Lithuanian
from my neighbors.

14
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:34,979
They're great.

15
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:36,605
They're always out there in the hall,
you know,

16
00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:39,312
cooking and gambling and
giving each other haircuts.

17
00:00:39,324 --> 00:00:40,804
It's nice.

18
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,090
Hey, is that a toilet
in your kitchen?

19
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,267
Or a stove in your bathroom?

20
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,829
Oh, that's not just a stove.

21
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,495
That's a stovenkerator:

22
00:00:49,512 --> 00:00:53,452
a combination of a stove,
oven and sink and refrigerator.

23
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:54,782
Stovenkerator.

24
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:56,276
Isn't that futuristic?

25
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:57,725
God, I hope not.

26
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:00,462
Hey, cool Murphy bed.

27
00:01:00,475 --> 00:01:03,795
Yeah, it's kind of a mess.
I didn't make my bed this morning, so...

28
00:01:03,817 --> 00:01:05,147
Oh!

29
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:10,451
You know what, I bet sleeping
at this angle is good for you.

30
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,050
For some reason.

31
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:13,858
I got it.

32
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:22,891
That was, something, something,
I am going to, something,

33
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:26,012
you like a, something, donkey.

34
00:01:26,022 --> 00:01:27,502
Huh.

35
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,661
Other cultures.

36
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:32,496
Hey, let's break out
the fruit basket.

37
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,619
Hey, who ate all the...?

38
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:39,249
Sync by vNaru

39
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:56,295
Okay, we have to get Lily out of that
apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.

40
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:59,565
I'd offer her my place,
but I've got dogs and she's allergic.

41
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:02,909
Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think
she's a little more allergic to that.

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,930
The Fortress of Barnitude?
No way.

43
00:02:08,946 --> 00:02:10,356
Come on. She's desperate.

44
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,482
Hmm, normally a prerequisite
for the women I bring home,

45
00:02:12,517 --> 00:02:14,057
but... pass.

46
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:18,444
One of you guys is very,
very lucky because I have...

47
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:21,903
a boom, an extra ticket to the
Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in?

48
00:02:21,915 --> 00:02:23,385
- Absolutely not.
- No.

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,350
Damn! I got these tickets,
like, months ago for me and Lily

50
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:28,695
and now I can't find
anyone to go with me.

51
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,677
This is what I miss
about being in a couple.

52
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,643
I always had someone to
go to concerts with,

53
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:34,228
or farmer's market,

54
00:02:34,244 --> 00:02:35,824
or brunch.

55
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,451
God, I miss brunch!

56
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,439
Well, I guess you could-- well,
you could try going to brunch alone.

57
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,539
Oh, you don't think I've tried?

58
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:44,216
Table for one.

59
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,521
One couple?

60
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:47,888
Um, no, just me.

61
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:49,283
Really?

62
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,079
For brunch?

63
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:53,225
You're right. Who am I kidding?

64
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:57,586
Ooh, The Popover Pantry. That place is
great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?

65
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:58,968
Of course, sweetie.

66
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:00,177
Can I go with you guys?

67
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:02,803
Really? For brunch?

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,449
God, I hate being single!

69
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,645
Okay, I'll take the over
on the Pittsburgh game.

70
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,879
Oh, and P.
to the S., I never got my payout

71
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,932
from Seattle from
two weeks ago.

72
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:19,138
Yeah. Don't make me call the
gaming commission on you.

73
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,248
I'm sure they'd be very interested
to know what's going on over there.

74
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,950
All right? All right?

75
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,855
Okay, I love you, too, Mom.
Take care.

76
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:33,268
Hello, Lily.

77
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:38,558
You've somehow managed to
circumvent my security.

78
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:40,403
How did you do it?

79
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:42,129
Ted gave me your spare key.

80
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:44,232
Spare key, brilliant!

81
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:46,417
I'm sorry,
but you know I'd only come here

82
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,504
if I had no other choice.

83
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:52,238
But earlier today, I was getting
ready to go to sleep and...

84
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,379
Sveikas.

85
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,499
That's terrible.

86
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:13,213
Well, see ya.

87
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,420
Well, can I stay here maybe?

88
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:18,896
Oh... I'd let you,
but I don't have any room.

89
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:20,978
You live in a
two-bedroom apartment.

90
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:23,801
You have one room
just for your suits.

91
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:27,796
Hey, I'm at a point in my life
where my suits are my family.

92
00:04:27,815 --> 00:04:29,855
Look around you, Lily.

93
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,480
You are in the heart
of bachelor country,

94
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:35,803
and as a woman,
you are an illegal immigrant here.

95
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:39,826
Now, you can try to apply for a sex
visa, but that only lasts 12 hours.

96
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,966
14 if you qualify
for multiple entry.

97
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:47,987
Eww... is something some lame,
judgmental chick would say,

98
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:51,788
but I say give me
multiple high fives.

99
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:54,237
Wow, you really are desperate.

100
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:55,434
I really am.

101
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:59,341
Okay, you can stay
here for two days.

102
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:03,352
But I only have one rule.
You can't change anything.

103
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:06,522
Why would I change anything?
This place is...

104
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,563
...perfect.

105
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,866
Except for the fact that
you don't have a TV.

106
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,910
See that wall?

107
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,527
300-inch flat-screen.

108
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,450
They only sell them in Japan,
but I know a guy.

109
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:27,254
Had to ship it over in a
tugboat like freakin' King Kong.

110
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:28,713
It hurts my eyes.

111
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,641
Yeah. That doesn't go away.

112
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:35,754
- Hey.
- Hey, where have you been?

113
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,469
The Alanis Morissette concert.

114
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:38,545
By yourself?

115
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:40,864
No, actually I went with
a friend from law school.

116
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:44,217
Oh, really? Who's this friend?

117
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,990
Brad.

118
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:50,265
- Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks!
- Totally!

119
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,995
I can't believe I almost
didn't come tonight.

120
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,793
Let me guess:
You bought the tickets for you and Lily

121
00:05:53,827 --> 00:05:55,297
right before she dumped you.

122
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,162
Yeah, how'd you know?

123
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:58,948
I just got dumped myself.

124
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,627
What, Kara broke up with you?

125
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,717
I'm sorry, man. That sucks.

126
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:09,614
Brad, do you like brunch?

127
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,210
You invited him to brunch?

128
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:13,636
Yeah, I invited him to brunch.
Why, is that weird?

129
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,509
Yes. That's why I was all,
"You invited him to brunch?"

130
00:06:17,522 --> 00:06:21,122
Why can't two guys who
are friends go to brunch?

131
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,603
Because brunch is kind of...

132
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,037
Girly.

133
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:27,524
Girly? Breakfast isn't girly.

134
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:30,016
Lunch isn't girly.
What makes brunch girly?

135
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,970
I don't know.

136
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,839
There's nothing
girly about a horse.

137
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,654
Nothing girly about a horn,

138
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,349
but put them together
and you get a unicorn.

139
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,733
I don't care what
either of you say,

140
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:43,048
I am going to The
Popover Pantry with Brad.

141
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:44,779
We're here. We're hungry.

142
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:47,256
Get used to it, brunch.

143
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:55,644
- Hmm... smells delicious.
- Thank you.

144
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,290
There was no food in the fridge,
so I picked up...

145
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:59,979
What are you doing?

146
00:06:59,992 --> 00:07:01,892
Lily, what was the
first rule again?

147
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,146
Don't change anything.

148
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,932
And what was the second rule?

149
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,709
- There was no second rule.
- Exactly!

150
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:09,834
There was only one
rule and you broke it.

151
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,166
I bought groceries.
That counts as changing something?

152
00:07:13,188 --> 00:07:15,378
Lily, if I wanted a
fridge full of groceries,

153
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,343
or fresh coffee in the morning,

154
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,549
I'd be in a relationship.

155
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:24,552
But I don't want to
be in a relationship.

156
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:27,671
That's why I make it crystal-clear to
every girl that walks through that door

157
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,843
that this is not a place
to leave a toothbrush.

158
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:32,447
This is not a place to
leave a contact lens case.

159
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:34,781
This is a place to leave.

160
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:36,418
Come on, I'll give you a tour.

161
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:38,392
Uh, no flash
photography, please.

162
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,677
Bienvenido to the bedroom.

163
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,441
Dig this: king-sized bed,

164
00:07:43,456 --> 00:07:45,456
full-sized blanket, one pillow.

165
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,080
Everything about this bed says,
"our work here is done."

166
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:52,155
Next we say "bienvenue"
to the bathroom.

167
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:54,296
What, only one towel?

168
00:07:54,322 --> 00:07:55,912
What, no hairdryer?

169
00:07:55,928 --> 00:07:59,268
You know where I keep that stuff?
Your place. Beat it.

170
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,689
And the coup de grace...

171
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:08,282
Yeah, that's right.

172
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:11,064
Patent-pending.

173
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,869
And wilkommen to the hallway.

174
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:16,074
While guys like Ted and
Marshall may hide their porn...

175
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,588
Marshall doesn't have porn.

176
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:19,394
Aww, that's sweet.

177
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:21,692
While guys like Ted and
Marshall may hide their porn,

178
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:24,976
I had mine...
professionally lit.

179
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:29,514
Girls see this, they can't
get out of here fast enough.

180
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,775
And if that doesn't
drive them away,

181
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:33,502
there's always your
life-sized storm-trooper.

182
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:35,707
No, that's just awesome.

183
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:38,021
So you see,
whenever a girl wakes up here,

184
00:08:38,035 --> 00:08:40,595
I never have to tell her to go
build her nest somewhere else.

185
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:43,032
My apartment does it for me.

186
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:45,735
God, I love brunch.

187
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,288
Oh, damn...

188
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,585
the zucchini bread
is "ridonculous."

189
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,299
This isn't weird, right?

190
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:53,703
I sort of thought it might be,

191
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,040
but it totally isn't.

192
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:58,305
And B-T-dub, you totally did
not oversell the eggs Benny.

193
00:08:58,317 --> 00:08:59,277
Right? Right?

194
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:03,787
I mean, why can't two single bros go out
and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?

195
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:07,284
Exactly. Thank you,
that's exactly what I've been saying.

196
00:09:07,705 --> 00:09:09,525
This must be destiny.

197
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,731
What are you talking about?

198
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,190
I have two tickets for
Mamma Mia Friday night.

199
00:09:13,205 --> 00:09:14,765
You like Abba, right?

200
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:16,359
What am I saying? Who doesn't?

201
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:20,145
Anyway, I was gonna take Kara,
but now it's all you and me.

202
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,676
We're gonna do Broadway, bro style.
What do you say?

203
00:09:22,691 --> 00:09:24,241
Yeah!

204
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:35,059
Hey. Did the cold wake you?

205
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:38,333
No, I've just been
watching you sleep.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,290
Oh, did you try and take a shower?
I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.

207
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:46,292
I don't buy into the myth that
we need to shower every day.

208
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,136
Okay.

209
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:51,758
I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't
have any, so you're gonna have to...

210
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,070
I'm boycotting coffee.

211
00:09:53,087 --> 00:09:56,537
You may as well drink the tears
of a Colombian peasant farmer.

212
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,629
God, I love this place.

213
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:00,196
Good thing I don't have a job

214
00:10:00,212 --> 00:10:03,202
because I could
stay here all day.

215
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,710
I think I left something
on the bookshelf.

216
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:10,385
Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look.

217
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,269
Oh, I'm disgusting.

218
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:15,842
Wow, you're open
about your sexuality

219
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:18,554
and that's one of the
reasons I love you.

220
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,788
Did I just say that?

221
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:23,473
Oh, well, cat's out of the bag.

222
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:25,267
I love you.

223
00:10:25,282 --> 00:10:29,462
Whoa, uh... Okay, beep, beep.
Backing up, um...

224
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,932
Hi, Barney. Oh...

225
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:35,027
Oh, my God. Are you married?
Is this your wife?

226
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,800
What? No.

227
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:38,496
Yes!

228
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:41,139
- Yes?
- Yes.

229
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:42,963
You son of a bitch!

230
00:10:42,969 --> 00:10:46,459
I can't believe I let
you enter my sacred temple.

231
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:50,111
Come on, baby. Please, no.
Oh, you don't understand.

232
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:53,163
What have I done? This is the worst.
How could you...?

233
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:56,883
You're not going anywhere.

234
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:03,819
Wow, that was close.

235
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:05,534
That hippie chick
wouldn't leave.

236
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:07,158
She was ready to squat here.

237
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:10,987
Well, she'd have to with your
spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?

238
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:13,778
She was freakishly immune to
everything in my apartment...

239
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,412
except you.

240
00:11:15,904 --> 00:11:18,224
You're better than porn.

241
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:19,761
Thank you.

242
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:22,607
How would you like to
extend your stay here?

243
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,940
All you'd have to do is
pretend to be my wife,

244
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,852
and scare off the
occasional one-night stand.

245
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:29,229
I know, I know. You've got your ethics.
You've got your principles...

246
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:30,615
I'll do it.

247
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:31,762
Really?

248
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:35,548
Barney, you've clearly got
some serious mother issues

249
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:39,907
that have left you the emotional
equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat.

250
00:11:39,928 --> 00:11:42,038
But, in my other apartment,
I would be living

251
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:46,231
with an actual scavenging sewer rat,
so you win.

252
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:47,993
I'll take it.

253
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:51,496
- Mamma Mia?
- Mamma Mia.

254
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,371
You know what? It's supposed
to be a great musical, okay?

255
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:56,352
It won all sorts of
Tonys and stuff.

256
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,947
No, totally. It sounds like a really,
really fun, exciting, third date.

257
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:03,281
Ooh, third date.
You know what that means.

258
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:05,651
It is not a date, okay.

259
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:08,605
It's just two bros taking
in a Broadway show.

260
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,668
You bros going to get
dinner beforehand?

261
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:12,373
We might grab a steak, yeah.

262
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,162
Where at?

263
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:17,345
Cafe L'Amour.

264
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,879
Brad says the food is
really good there, okay.

265
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:23,421
Sounds like Brad's got
quite the night planned out.

266
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:24,836
You better bring your "A" game.

267
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:27,471
That means no granny panties.

268
00:12:27,483 --> 00:12:29,533
All right, you know what?
You two are just threatened

269
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,260
because I'm a single guy moving
in on your couples' turf.

270
00:12:32,272 --> 00:12:35,052
Well, guess what?
It's my territory now.

271
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:38,475
I'm peeing all over brunches,
fancy dinners and musicals.

272
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:42,039
That's right;
Brad and I are taking back Broadway.

273
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:43,291
What are you going to wear?

274
00:12:43,306 --> 00:12:45,496
I was thinking like this
collared shirt and these pin...

275
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,181
Oh, you know what? Shut up.

276
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:51,164
Can you pass the
Arts and Leisure?

277
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:59,355
Can you pass the
Arts and Leisure?

278
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:01,067
I just did.

279
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:02,884
Honey, I'm...

280
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:06,752
Barney, what the hell
is going on here?

281
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:08,022
Lily, I can explain...

282
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,939
How could you? In our own home?

283
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,632
You bastard!

284
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:15,438
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know he had...
- Just get out.

285
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:18,911
This is what I get after I worked
as a stripper for four years

286
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,054
to put you through
medical school?

287
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,307
I got breast implants for you.

288
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:27,461
I... I was just about
to turn on the tears.

289
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,960
Brava.

290
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,186
That was incredible.

291
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:35,452
And that slap was genius.
You did not hold back.

292
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:38,094
Yeah, that I just
always wanted to do.

293
00:13:38,107 --> 00:13:39,567
Fair enough.

294
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,211
I have to say,

295
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,730
it's kind of nice having food
around here for a change.

296
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:45,015
You know...

297
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,892
nah, never mind.

298
00:13:46,904 --> 00:13:47,974
What?

299
00:13:47,983 --> 00:13:50,313
You're my wife.
You can tell me anything.

300
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:53,116
Well, if you really
wanted to sell this ruse,

301
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,230
we should try to make this
place a little more...

302
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:57,474
you know, homey.

303
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:00,049
Like-like a woman would
actually live here.

304
00:14:00,063 --> 00:14:02,143
What did you have in mind?

305
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:14,141
♪ Bones, bones,
brittle little bones ♪

306
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:16,331
♪ It's not the milk you seek ♪

307
00:14:16,346 --> 00:14:19,096
♪ It's the sun you need ♪

308
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:24,111
♪ Sugar dumpling, muffin baby ♪

309
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,549
♪ This world is going crazy ♪

310
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,337
♪ Do do do do ♪

311
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:32,663

312
00:14:32,676 --> 00:14:35,946
♪ Do do do do do ♪

313
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:39,166
Hey, you're home.

314
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:41,262
I didn't think we'd be seeing
you until tomorrow morning.

315
00:14:41,295 --> 00:14:44,485
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It wasn't a date.

316
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:48,906
Okay, it was a date
and it got way weird.

317
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,062
Oh, you really don't
have to do that.

318
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:56,758
No, I insist. You're my guest.

319
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:58,430
Thanks, Brad.

320
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:00,914
Bro,

321
00:15:00,931 --> 00:15:03,431
you got some chocolate
on your chin.

322
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,028
Still there.

323
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,897
I'll get that bad boy.

324
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:13,762
Whoa.

325
00:15:13,771 --> 00:15:15,291
Well, it could have been worse.

326
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:17,566
It could have
fallen in your lap.

327
00:15:19,496 --> 00:15:21,146
It gets worse.

328
00:15:21,163 --> 00:15:24,343
No, I-I can do it, Brad.
Okay, thank you.

329
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,833
So anyway, ah,
it's this Saturday.

330
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:29,517
Do you want to come?

331
00:15:30,268 --> 00:15:33,038
You want me to go to
a wedding with you?

332
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:36,022
Okay, that's not too bad.

333
00:15:36,037 --> 00:15:38,817
Two single guys on the prowl.
It'll be like Wedding Crashers.

334
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,860
Just keep Brad away
from the bouquet.

335
00:15:43,357 --> 00:15:45,287
It gets worse.

336
00:15:45,305 --> 00:15:46,675
It gets better.

337
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:50,049
The foliage in Vermont this
time of year is ridonc.

338
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,024
Vermont?

339
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, the wedding's
at this awesome B&B.

340
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,203
Kara and I used to go there.

341
00:15:55,216 --> 00:15:58,176
Anyway, there is one room left,
and we got it.

342
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,451
Walt Whitman Suite, bro.

343
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:06,387
You said no, right?

344
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:07,781
Of course.

345
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,166
I understand.

346
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:10,436
It's cool.

347
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:12,961
It's the first time I was
going to see my college friends

348
00:16:12,975 --> 00:16:15,065
since Kara left me.

349
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:16,711
I just...

350
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:20,743
I just miss her so much.

351
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,617
I'll go to Vermont with you.

352
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:29,271
That's great!

353
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:31,477
You know, uh,
they're registered at Pottery Barn.

354
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,620
I figure we could go
halfsies on a gravy boat.

355
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:41,526
I'm sorry.
It's not funny anymore.

356
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:43,587
Damn you, brunch!

357
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,019
This guy's crazy, right?

358
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,158
Look, I don't think he's crazy.

359
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,663
I just think he's suffering from a
severe case of girlfriend withdrawal.

360
00:16:51,673 --> 00:16:54,383
And unfortunately,
you're his nicotine patch.

361
00:16:54,398 --> 00:16:58,418
And now you have to do what every
dysfunctional couple has to do:

362
00:16:58,438 --> 00:16:59,508
break up.

363
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:00,884
You're right. You're right.
I promised Brad

364
00:17:00,912 --> 00:17:03,362
I would go to the wedding with him,
and then that is it.

365
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:04,884
Good man.

366
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:08,099
Oh, I think we made
the right decision

367
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,385
going for the custom-made
Italian sheets.

368
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:13,999
Hey, if my bed's going suit up,
it's going to do it right.

369
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:16,052
Want to give it a whirl?

370
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:22,658
All right, I'm going to head out,
hit the bars.

371
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:24,139
What are you going
to do tonight?

372
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:28,077
Oh, I was just going to watch Letterman
but, God this bed is so comfy.

373
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:30,575
I wish you had a TV in here.

374
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:38,171
Okay, seriously,
what do you do for a living?

375
00:17:38,184 --> 00:17:39,724
Please.

376
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,133
I thought you were going out.

377
00:17:44,137 --> 00:17:45,227
Eh.

378
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:47,228
After the monologue.

379
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:50,559
The next morning,
as the sun rose over Manhattan,

380
00:17:50,572 --> 00:17:52,652
your Uncle Marshall headed
over to Brad's apartment

381
00:17:52,668 --> 00:17:54,718
to leave for the
wedding in Vermont.

382
00:17:54,733 --> 00:17:56,443
But when he got there...

383
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,740
No.

384
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,854
No...

385
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:02,757
No.

386
00:18:03,244 --> 00:18:05,104
No!

387
00:18:05,588 --> 00:18:07,238
No.

388
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:12,815
Ted.

389
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:15,689
Um, Brad got me flowers.

390
00:18:15,702 --> 00:18:17,072
Hold on.

391
00:18:17,142 --> 00:18:19,242
Brad got him flowers.

392
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:23,112
I'm sorry.
It just got funny again.

393
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,547
- Oh, hey...
- No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it.

394
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,615
I do like you. And calla lilies
are my favorite flower.

395
00:18:31,637 --> 00:18:34,247
I don't know how you knew that.
I guess you just get me,

396
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,079
but this is not cool, man.
I can't believe that you would...

397
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:40,211
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

398
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:47,106
- Hey, Marshall.
- Hi, Kara.

399
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:49,509
So you guys, are like,
back together now?

400
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:52,175
Yeah. Happened last night.

401
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:56,011
Uh, I'm sorry, bro.

402
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:57,979
- I should have called you.
- Yeah, you should have.

403
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:00,305
- Well, I didn't mean to hurt...
- Don't, Brad.

404
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:04,544
Just don't.

I don't know.

409
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:17,241

- what have we done?
- Nothing.

413
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:37,258
Nothing happened.
We-we just went to sleep.

414
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,020
Just went to sleep? I don't sleep
in the same bed as a woman

415
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,224
and not make a move.

416
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:44,848
How could... You.

417
00:19:44,861 --> 00:19:47,841
You spooned me against my will.

418
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,173
Hey, it takes two to cuddle.

419
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:51,617
We...

420
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,122
We...

421
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:56,878
We redecorated my place.

422
00:19:56,891 --> 00:20:01,191
We stayed in on a Friday
night to watch Letterman,

423
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,421
and then slept together
and didn't have sex?

424
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:06,977
Oh, my God,
we're in a relationship.

425
00:20:07,257 --> 00:20:10,247
That's what you think
a relationship is?

426
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:11,703
You were supposed
to be the vaccine,

427
00:20:11,717 --> 00:20:15,107
but you gave me the disease.
You gotta go.

428
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:17,358
Barney.

429
00:20:17,953 --> 00:20:21,743
I don't think you're mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.

430
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:25,132
You let down your guard,
and let someone into your life,

431
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:28,624
and-and it actually felt okay.

432
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:31,905
And that terrifies you.

433
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,380
Uh-huh. You gotta go.

434
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:37,943
Hey, you can't just kick me out!
I put a lot of work into this place,

435
00:20:37,956 --> 00:20:41,166
and I've grown accustomed to
a certain standard of living.

436
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:44,026
A certain standard of living?
You didn't pay a single...

437
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:47,092
And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson,
after two weeks of marriage,

438
00:20:47,105 --> 00:20:48,825
decided to call it quits.

439
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,998
Fortunately, they
reached a settlement.

440
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:55,575
And that's the story of how Aunt
Lily furnished her apartment.

441
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:00,995
Marshall ran into Brad
again some time later.

442
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,710
Oh, my God, it's Brad.

443
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:04,677
Laugh like I said
something really funny.

444
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:06,512
Right, right.

445
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:07,356
Hey, Marshall.

446
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:08,946
Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?

447
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:10,383
It's good.

448
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,089
- Hey, I'm, uh...
- Yeah, I know who you are.

449
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:15,949
Well, I got to go.
I got this thing.

450
00:21:15,964 --> 00:21:17,914
Yeah, me too,
but more important.

451
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:19,489
So, I guess I'll
see you around.

452
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:22,027
Sure. Sure.

453
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:28,292
Even if you don't believe it,
tell me he looks fat.

454
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,585
Totally looks fat.
