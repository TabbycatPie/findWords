- Thank you.

- Okay.

All right, so, Barney,
are you doing this or what?

11
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:42,896
- Oh, jeez, Barney, don't do this.
- I have to. It's my birthday present to Ted.

12
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:45,290
You don't have to.
Please, it's going to be embarrassing,

13
00:00:45,386 --> 00:00:47,557
and we're gonna have
to stop coming here, which will suck,

14

kind of healthy.

- Try not to speak. Here, sit down.

Nope. I hit the snooze button.

I think there might be
some internal bleeding.

45
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,232
Probably some fractures.

I'm not going to settle.

she has to be perfect.

- Well, what's perfect?
- Well, it's not like I have a list.

- Oh, yes, you do.
- Attractive, college-educated.

She wants two kids, a boy and a girl.

- That's not hard. I know at least...
- I'm not done.

She likes dogs, Otis Redding,

She's into sports,

73
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,935
but not so much so that her legs
are, like, more muscular than mine.

74

- You're never going to find this girl.

Doesn't she run this place?

Well, my firm bought out the company.

You know, we're a high-end meats

168
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:55,549
<i>Her favorite singer was Otis Redding.
And she wanted two kids, a boy and a girl.</i>

169
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,841
All right, fine. Set it up.

170
00:07:58,934 --> 00:08:01,934
You wanted to see me,
so I guess that means we're taIking again.

171
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,910
Will you taste this latte for me?
I think they gave me decaf.

172
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,682
It tastes normal to me.

173
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:13,716
That's what I thought, too.
Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.

174
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:17,284
- Oh, God!
- It got me as well.

175
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,973
Well, then why did you have me drink it?

176
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,746
Because now you're in.

177
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,272
Okay.

178
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:26,933
Don't think I'm overlooking
the obvious fact...

179
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:29,200
that I should just be mad at you.

180
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:34,020
But Executive Mischief Consultant
Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty.

181
00:08:34,116 --> 00:08:36,393
Let's make that bastard pay.

182
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:38,074
You think that
we should brush our teeth first?

183
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,948
- Yeah, it's probably a good idea.
- Let's go.

184
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:44,013
<i>OLDER TED: So, that night I had
a blind date with my perfect match.</i>

185
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:46,025
<i>I was so excited, I got there early.</i>

186
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,525
<i>But before it even started...</i>

187
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:49,534
(PHONE RINGING)

188
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:51,516
Lily?

189
00:08:51,611 --> 00:08:53,367
Hey, Ted, are you busy?

190
00:08:53,463 --> 00:08:55,377
Um, yes.

191
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:57,805
Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot.

192
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,103
Listen, could you take
a cab out to Dutchess County...

193
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,147
and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?

194
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,520
<i>What?</i>

195
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:06,788
What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?

196
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:08,723
Marshall can't know about this.

197
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:11,789
Look, Ted, it's dark,
I don't know how to change a tire,

198
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,780
and I've stumbled into the beginning
of a very scary campfire story.

199
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:18,205
- Can you please hurry?
- I can't. I'm waiting...

200
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,622
Oh, my God,
is that a drifter with a hook for a hand?

201
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,442
No, drifter, no!

202
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:26,710
- Come on, Lily.
- But you see my point.

203
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,729
All right, stay there. I'm on my way.

204
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:39,902
<i>OLDER TED: And so, one $90 cab ride later,
I was in the middle of nowhere.</i>

205
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:43,599
Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this.

206
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:45,451
- Did you get ahold of your date?
- Yes.

207
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:48,771
- And was she okay about pushing it back?
- Yes. Because she's perfect!

208
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,304
So, what am I doing here?

209
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,379
- You can never tell Marshall.
- I won't.

210
00:09:52,475 --> 00:09:56,146
Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives
of your unborn boy and girl.

211
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:58,275
I swear on Luke and Leia.

212
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:03,413
About a month ago,
I started getting insomnia.

213
00:10:03,553 --> 00:10:07,192
<i>LILY: Marrying Marshall had been
all I wanted for a long time.</i>

214
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:10,832
<i>But now that it was really happening,
it seemed kind of huge and scary.</i>

215
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:13,769
<i>TED: Did you taIk to Marshall about it?
LILY: He wouldn't have understood.</i>

216
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,419
<i>He's not exactly nervous
about tying the knot.</i>

217
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,428
(SNORING)

218
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:23,773
<i>So I spent my nights reading, painting,</i>

219
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,837
<i>setting the high score
on Super Bomberman.</i>

220
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,848
<i>- TED: That was you? Awesome!
- I know!</i>

221
00:10:27,944 --> 00:10:31,808
<i>I just got in the zone and...
Not the point of the story.</i>

222
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:33,691
<i>And then I started thinking about Victoria...</i>

223
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:35,957
<i>and how she followed
her dream to Germany,</i>

224
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,033
<i>then I found this art fellowship.</i>

225
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:42,683
- Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.
- San Francisco.

226
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:47,675
But it's not like I'm going to do it.
The dates conflict with the wedding.

227
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,909
But I love painting,
and I've always wondered if I'm any good.

228
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,657
This was the way to find out.

229
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:59,493
- And the interview is tonight.
- In New Haven.

230
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,777
You don't want to get married.

231
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,139
Of course I want to get married!

232
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,491
I... It's not like I was ever going to do it.

233
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:15,833
I just... I just really wanted to see
if I could get this.

234
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:19,601
Lily, we live in the center
of art and culture in America.

235
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:21,995
I'm sure you could find a program here
that's just as selective.

236
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,293
But you chose one
in a city 3,000 miles away,

237
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,209
and you didn't tell Marshall.

238
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:29,720
I think it's pretty clear what that means.

239
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:32,433
Okay, I...

240
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:34,921
I was having second thoughts.

241
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,469
But I'm not anymore.

242
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:42,555
I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign.
I'm not supposed to do this.

243
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:46,229
I'm supposed to go home
and be with Marshall.

244
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:51,208
- You must think I'm so stupid.
- I don't think you're stupid.

245
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:54,963
- I love Marshall.
- I know you do. Come here.

246
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:58,646
It's okay.

247
00:11:58,742 --> 00:12:02,808
Look, marriage is big.
You're allowed to freak out.

248
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,134
But why am I the only one?

249
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,681
How come Marshall isn't doing
anything crazy?

250
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:12,576
So all we need is one large shipping box
and 100 white mice.

251
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:16,491
All done.

252
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,700
Ted, let's go to New Haven.

253
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,342
Lily, don't do this to yourself.

254
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:25,432
I just need to know if I can get in.

255
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:28,401
If I do this interview,
and get into the program, then I'll know,

256
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,764
and I can forget all about it,
and get married.

257
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:32,200
Come on! It's an adventure.

258
00:12:32,296 --> 00:12:34,818
No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.

259
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:38,637
Okay, yes, it's a mistake.
I know it's a mistake.

260
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:41,638
But there are certain things in life
where you know it's a mistake,

261
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,235
but you don't really know it's a mistake,

262
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,140
because the only way to really know
it's a mistake is to make the mistake,

263
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,470
and look back and say,
'Yep, that was a mistake.'

264
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:51,695
So, really, the bigger mistake would be
to not make the mistake...

265
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,611
because then you'd go your whole life
not really knowing...

266
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,271
if something is a mistake or not.

267
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:57,346
And, damn it, I've made no mistakes!

268
00:12:57,442 --> 00:12:58,719
I've done all of this,

269
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:02,864
my life, my relationship,
my career, mistake-free.

270
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:05,933
Does any of this make sense to you?

271
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,584
I don't know. You said 'mistake' a lot.

272
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,308
Lily, don't do this.

273
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,735
Ted, I'm getting married in two months,

274
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,873
and I'm freaking out,
and you're my best friend,

275
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:17,906
- and you just have to forgive me for this.
- But forgive you for what?

276
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:20,037
Lily. Lily!

277
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,734
Hey, Lily, this is Ted,

278
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:29,353
the guy you left stranded
by the side of the road.

279
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:31,493
Just wanted to say good luck
with the interview.

280
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:32,929
Remember to pick up some miIk.

281
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:36,766
Oh, and when I get home,
I'm going to kill you.

282
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:40,475
And, also, I texted you the same thing.

283
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,382
Hey, I need a big favor.

284
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:49,467
Anything, bro.

285
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,542
I need you to come up to Dutchess County
and pick me up.

286
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:53,551
No.

287
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:57,065
- It's kind of an emergency.
- What are you doing in Dutchess County?

288
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:59,779
Apple picking. Can you just get up here?

289
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,949
I wish I could help, buddy,
but I'm stuck here at work.

290
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,578
We're kind of swamped.

291
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:06,420
- Hey, is that Ted?
- Yeah. He's stuck in Dutchess County.

292
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:07,920
Don't you have a big date tonight?

293
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:10,569
(STAMMERING) Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.

294
00:14:10,665 --> 00:14:13,284
So what are you doing
in Dutchess County?

295
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,242
Can't a brother go apple picking
without getting the third degree? Damn!

296
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:19,190
Okay, well, hang on.
I'm coming to get you.

297
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,584
- No!
- Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.

298
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,876
No, no, no. Just forget it.

299
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:27,587
A little prank. I'm not in Dutchess County.

300
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:30,524
So, that's the prank?
That you're not in Dutchess County?

301
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,571
Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.

302
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:40,006
Hey, check it out.
This one actually looks like Butterfield.

303
00:14:40,102 --> 00:14:42,015
(GIGGLING)

304
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,465
You know, over at the NRDC,
it's a bunch of really committed people...

305
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,169
who take their job of saving the Earth
very, very seriously.

306
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,467
Which is great and everything, but

307
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:54,532
I can't imagine having
this much fun over there.

308
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,054
You're thinking about
coming to work here full-time?

309
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,746
Maybe.

310
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:00,471
- Don't tell Lily, okay?
- No.

311
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,407
- Taking off for the night.
- Thanks, Tracy.

312
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:07,749
Are you guys planning
on punching some holes in that box?

313
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:09,759
Of course we are.

314
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:12,378
- Were you going to think of that?
- No.

315
00:15:12,474 --> 00:15:14,901
- That would have been bad.
- Horrible.

316
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:19,051
<i>OLDER TED: Luckily, there was still
one person I could call to get a ride home.</i>

317
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:22,403
- Need a ride, cowboy?
- Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.

318
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:26,102
- Too bad. I got candy.
- Candy?

319
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,258
So, you're not going to tell me
what you were doing...

320
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:32,205
by the side of a highway
in Dutchess County?

321
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,238
- Nope. Sworn to secrecy.
- Oh, come on.

322
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,448
- I like your hat.
- Right.

323
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,697
This is embarrassing. I got highlights.

324
00:15:40,793 --> 00:15:44,697
Oh, for the waiting room
of your dental practice?

325
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:48,296
<i>- Highlights is a children's magazine.
- Yeah, I got it.</i>

326
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:49,573
I thought it might look cool.

327
00:15:49,669 --> 00:15:53,723
Of course, my colorist took 'highlights'
to mean, 'I want to look like a tiger,'

328
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,820
- hence the hat.
- Oh. I gotta see this.

329
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,789
- No way.
- Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad.

330
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:01,798
I bet it looks great!

'So,' she says, changing the subject,
'Big date tonight.'

00:16:08,313 --> 00:16:10,644
How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?

333
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,749
Kind of amazingly. She's 28, like me.

334
00:16:13,868 --> 00:16:15,781
Wow, I'm 28.

335
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,360
College-educated, check.
Plays tennis, check.

You know, it's very rude
to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.

339
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:33,503
- We're not indoors. We're in a van.
- Vans have doors. Let me see your hair.

340
00:16:33,598 --> 00:16:36,852
- Never. What else?
- She loves lasagna.

341
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:40,431
- Barf.
- You know, I am sensing a pattern here.

342
00:16:40,527 --> 00:16:42,314
What else?

343
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,124

And she's looking to get married
and have kids?

00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,987
Check and check.
She wants two kids, a boy and a girl.

347
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,807
Wow.

348
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:57,990
You know, I've been thinking about this.
I think I want to have zero kids.

349
00:16:58,085 --> 00:16:59,938
Really? You don't want kids?

350
00:17:00,033 --> 00:17:04,588
You know, Ted, not everyone
is as much of a woman as you.

351

Hey. I'm driving.

352

Hey, thanks for picking me up.

354
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:20,968
Good luck on your date.
I hope she's everything you're looking for.

00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,977

I want you to go in there
with a smile on your face,

359
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:33,035
so here's what I'm going to do.

360
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:34,600
You're going to show me your hair?

361
00:17:34,695 --> 00:17:36,260
Actually, I was going
to show you my breasts,

362
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,470
but, sure, we can do hair.

- Hi.
- Hey.

So, Lil, did you get the miIk?

372
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:10,433
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

373
00:19:11,172 --> 00:19:14,670
You think you might want to drink the miIk?

374
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,934
No. Nope, I'm good.

375
00:19:19,026 --> 00:19:20,940
I don't need any miIk.

00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:26,433
Look, guys, I know miIk is important.

377
00:19:26,528 --> 00:19:28,968
It's got vitamin A, vitamin D.

00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:32,084
It's a great way to start the morning,
but Ted just had a huge date.

- How'd it go, dude?
- I didn't go.

What? Why?

381
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,427
I changed my mind.
I don't want to meet her.

382
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:41,475
Why? She sounds perfect.

383
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:45,066
I don't want perfect. I want Robin.

- Ted, it's a mistake!
- Maybe.

But it's a mistake I have to make.

Wrong. It's a mistake
you don't have to make.
