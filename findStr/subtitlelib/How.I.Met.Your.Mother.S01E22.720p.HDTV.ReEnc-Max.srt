00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,487
<i>OLDER TED: It was May of 2006
in New York City, and life was good.</i>

3
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:20,428
<i>But everything was about to change.</i>

4
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:22,784
So what do you think?

5
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:26,294
Robin again?

6
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:31,691
Ted, the universe clearly does not want
you and Robin to be together.

7
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:34,596
Don't piss off the universe.
The universe will slap you.

8
00:00:34,692 --> 00:00:35,809
Don't you think the universe...

9
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:38,043
has more important things
to worry about than my dating life?

10
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:42,033
Unless your dating life is the glue
holding the entire universe together.

11
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,219
Whoa, chills. Anybody else get chills?

12
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:49,312
Look, I realize we've been
down this road before,

13
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:53,493
but the fact is, whatever I do,
it all keeps coming back to Robin.

14
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:55,852
So I gotta do this.

15
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:00,068
- What the hell?
- That wasn't me.

16
00:01:00,164 --> 00:01:02,077
That was the universe.

17
00:01:02,974 --> 00:01:04,920
<i>OLDER TED: The funny thing was,
at that very moment,</i>

18
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,060
<i>the universe was working on something.
</i>

19
00:01:07,155 --> 00:01:08,336
<i>A storm.</i>

20
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:12,230
So Tropical Storm Willie
is gonna be with us at least until Monday.

21
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:14,816
It's gonna rain cats and dogs, foIks.

22
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:16,699
So don't step in a poodle.

23
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:19,178
- Sandy, Robin?
- Thanks, Lou.

24
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:20,274
Boy, too bad.

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,115
<i>Our big Metro News 1 camping trip
was gonna be this weekend.</i>

26
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:26,084
Yeah, but camping out in the rain?
No fun. Muddy. Yuck.

27
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:27,712
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,882
And we'll check in
with you tomorrow, New York.

29
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:31,542
Have a great night.

30
00:01:31,638 --> 00:01:33,234
MAN: And we're clear.

31
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,160
Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex
with you this weekend, Scherbatsky.

32
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:40,128
Well, I'd give you the
'I don't date co-workers' speech again,

33
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:43,001
but, God, you must have
that son-of-a-bitch memorized by now.

34
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,971
Shame, though.
It was a pretty hot show tonight.

35
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:49,035
The rhythmic give and take
of our improvised banter there at the end...

36
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,630
really got my freak juice flowing.

37
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,259
(LAUGHS)

38
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:53,714
Dude, he is right.

39
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:55,980
How many times do you have
to watch this crash and burn...

40
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:59,141
- before you say, 'Enough'?
- One more. One more time.

41
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:01,503
One more big, beautiful, stupid,
romantic gesture...

42
00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:04,120
and then, whatever she says,
yes or no, that's it.

43
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:05,556
If it's yes, great.

44
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:08,717
If it's no,
then I am done going after Robin forever.

45
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:12,036
So what's this big, beautiful,
romantic gesture?

46
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,165
I am going to make her...

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,174
a mix CD.

48
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,314
No, I'm kidding. I got a plan.

49
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:21,325
Lily, I'm gonna need the spare key
to Robin's apartment.

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,793
I see where this is going.

51
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,708
Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed...

52
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:27,772
wearing whipped cream undies
does not work.

53
00:02:27,868 --> 00:02:30,742
Usually. The setting,
Martha's Vineyard, 1999.

54
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:34,859
The characters, yours truly
and a raven-haired au pair by the...

55
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,519
Universe.

56
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,911
So this plan you speak of.

57
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:41,818
Remember the first night
Robin and I went out?

58
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:45,457
<i>TED: I stole a blue French horn for her,
and it almost worked.</i>

59
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:50,838
Yeah, dude, that was awesome.
But how are you ever gonna top that?

60
00:02:55,543 --> 00:02:58,162
She should be here any second. So...

61
00:02:58,257 --> 00:03:00,651
We're pretty hungry.
When do we get our pizza?

62
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:01,832
Enough with the...

63
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:04,258
We'll go get pizza later, all right?
Just stay...

64
00:03:04,354 --> 00:03:06,468
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)...

65
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:14,120
(CLEARS THROAT)...

66
00:03:15,813 --> 00:03:16,994
(SIGHING)

67
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,003
ROBIN: Damn it.

68
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,272
(PHONE RINGING)...

69
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,773
- Hello?
- Hey, Lily.

70
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:29,507
I'm locked out of my apartment.
I need to come pick up my extra key.

71
00:03:29,603 --> 00:03:31,516
Extra key?

72
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,200
Do I have an extra key to your apartment?

73
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:35,509
Yes, I gave it to you.

74
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:38,613
Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.

75
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,871
Great. Now I gotta go to the locksmith.

76
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:42,880
No. Wait.

77
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,956
Maybe you should just knock.

78
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:46,361
Knock?

79
00:03:46,456 --> 00:03:48,085
Lily, my dogs aren't that well-trained.

80
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,094
(DOOR OPENING)...

81
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,217
<i>(ROBIN CHATTERING ON PHONE)</i>

82
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,330
<i>Hello, Lily. This is Janet Kagen,</i>

83
00:03:55,426 --> 00:03:58,076
<i>at the Russell House Art Foundation
here in San Francisco.</i>

84
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,565
<i>I'm pleased to inform you
that we've accepted your application...</i>

85
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:01,874
<i>for our summer fellowship.</i>

86
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,204
<i>We look forward to hearing from you.
Bye-bye.</i>

87
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,227
Robin, I gotta go. Just knock, okay?

88
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:11,161
Summer fellowship?

89
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,357
Just knock. Okay.

90
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:22,488
- Hi.
- Hi.

91
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:31,175
(GASPS)

92
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:36,157
Robin. I've sort of said this already.

93
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:40,342
I mean, I've half-said it.
I've tried to say it and I've said it badly.

94
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:42,877
So this is me, just saying it.

95
00:04:43,406 --> 00:04:45,319
With strings.

96
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:49,694
I'm crazy about you.
I think we should be together.

97
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,703
What do you say?

98
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:02,855
- What do you say?
- Yes. No. I don't know.

99
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,835
Those are the three options.

100
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,719
- Ted, this is so...
- I know.

101
00:05:06,814 --> 00:05:09,559
<i>I mean, I come home,
I was gonna watch Jeopardy,</i>

102
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:12,070
and there's a string quartet,

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,473
and I have to pee.

104
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:16,548
Oh, I'm sorry.

105
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:20,197
- Well, go ahead, we'll wait.
- Great.

106
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:34,106
Yeah, 'cause when we taIked earlier,
you said there'd be pizza.

107
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,673
No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards.

108
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,437
Look, could we taIk about this later?

109
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:43,192
- I'm sort of professing my love here.
- Sure.

110
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,852
We're not getting any pizza.

111
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:51,116
Okay. Let's taIk.

112
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,447
Okay.

113
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,954
Hey, you guys wanna take five? All right.

114
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:02,323
Thanks, guys, we just need a minute.
Sort of a big life decision.

115
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:05,867
Love the blue instruments, though.
Kind of an inside joke.

116
00:06:05,962 --> 00:06:07,876
Thanks.

117
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:11,757
- You're crazy.
- Right. Come on.

118
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,070
It's not that I haven't thought about this.

119
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,369
You know that I have.
But let's look at this, okay?

120
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:18,571
We only just started being friends again.

121
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:20,767
I know. But come on.

122
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:24,955
And... And we want different things.
That's still there. That's not going away.

123
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,221
I mean, what if we do this
and it doesn't work out...

124
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:29,424
and I'd lose you as a friend?

125
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,893
I gotta think about this.

126
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:33,063
Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane.

127
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,659
Let's go to Paris for the weekend.
I'm serious.

128
00:06:34,755 --> 00:06:35,777
(EXCLAIMS)...

129
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:38,968
- I'm kidding. I'm serious.
- I can't go to Paris. I'm going camping.

130
00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:41,394
- Well, I thought that thing was canceled.
- Well, it's back on.

131
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,580
- Since when?
- Since like an hour ago.

132
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:47,491
Sending the storm
back out into the Atlantic.

133
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:50,231
So it's blue skies this weekend.

134
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,259
- Sandy, Robin?
- Thanks, Lou.

135
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:57,329
But that blue sky
isn't without at least one cloud.

136
00:06:57,477 --> 00:06:59,328
I'm sorry to announce
that one week from today

137
00:06:59,424 --> 00:07:01,945
<i>I will be leaving Metro News 1.</i>

138
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:04,403
It has been an honor
to bring you the news each night,

139
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:06,989
and read the paper to you each morning.

140
00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,564
I will always treasure it.
Good night, New York.

141
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,288
MAN: And we're clear.

142
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:15,636
- You're leaving?
- There. I quit my job.

143
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,289
We're not co-workers.
Will you please have dinner with me?

144
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:19,725
(EXCLAIMS)

145
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:21,896
I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.

146
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:25,599
- Oh, congratulations.
- Congratulations, yourself.

147
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,865
- What do you mean?
- Well, Joe asked me...

148
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:30,770
who I thought should replace me
as lead anchor.

149
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:32,779
I told him you.

150
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,909
They're announcing it next week.
Act surprised.

151
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:38,780
Wow. Thanks.

152
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,495
And, yes.

153
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:44,762
- Yes, what?
- Yes, let's go get dinner.

154
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:48,102
How about this weekend
on the camping trip?

155
00:07:48,198 --> 00:07:50,111
I roast a mean weenie.

156
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:55,221
You're kidding me. No way.
Don't go on this thing.

157
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,870
Ted, I have to go.
It's a company camping trip.

158
00:07:57,966 --> 00:08:01,031
Really? Because it also kind of
sounds like a date with Sandy...

159
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,148
and his weenie.

160
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:03,361
(LAUGHS)...

161
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:07,035
- I mean, is this not a date?
- I don't know.

162
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:10,990
- So, what, you actually like this guy now?
- I don't know.

163
00:08:11,085 --> 00:08:13,224
- Are you gonna hook up with him?
- I don't know.

164
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,075
- Yes, you do.
- No, Ted, I don't.

165
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:16,959
And you know what? That's okay.

166
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:19,863
I don't plan out every second of my life,
like you do.

167
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,523
- I don't plan out every...
- Oh, really?

168
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:23,216
What is all of this?

169
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:26,982
I mean, why can't you just say,
'Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?'

170
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:31,802
No, it has to be a string quartet,
and Paris, and flowers, and chocolates,

171
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:33,972
and 'Let's spend
the rest of our lives together.'

172
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:37,101
(EXCLAIMS) Don't you think
we're a little past sushi at this point?

173
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:39,942
God, you are so terrified of anything real.

174
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:43,964
It's like you're floating out in space.
Touch the ground, Robin.

175
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,645
Live in the world, make a mistake.
Make this mistake.

176
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:48,336
I need to think about this.

177
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:50,060
Fine.

178
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,453
No. I'm sorry,

179
00:08:52,838 --> 00:08:56,253
I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.

180
00:08:57,084 --> 00:09:01,105
If you want me to say yes right now,
I can't do that.

181
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:04,210
Well, if it's not yes then it's a no.

182
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:09,393
Then I guess it's not meant to be.

183
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,885
- Nice try, buddy.
- Good hustle out there.

184
00:09:16,396 --> 00:09:18,853
Look at the bright side.
At least you got some closure.

185
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:22,461
She's made her choice,
and you can finally move on.

186
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:23,769
Screw that. This ain't over.

I don't care what I said.
This is gonna happen.

Fine.

I can't let Robin go camping with this guy.

So how do I keep that from happening?
Simple. I make it rain.

208

Ted, do you want me to slap you again?
'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.

No, you know what?

I am definitely crazy right now.
But I have a plan.

That girl you used to go out with, Penelope.

212

Wasn't she getting her PhD

- Yeah.
- Are you still in touch with her?

214
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:41,951
Sure. I mean,
even though we stopped having sex,

215
00:10:42,046 --> 00:10:44,281
we still get together like once a month
to chat and catch up,

216
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,909
and of course I'm not in touch with her!

217
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:47,984
Well, you're gonna
need to get in touch with her.

218
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,577
She's gonna teach me
how to do a rain dance.

219
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:54,905
- Did you just say a rain dance?
- Yes.

220
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:57,111
- A rain dance?
- Yes.

221
00:10:57,464 --> 00:11:00,522

- Yes.

Ted, you're forcing me
to be the voice of reason.

(SCOFFS) 'There's this girl?'

is a sacred prayer to nature.

looks too kindly on white dudes...

Penelope, this is the girl I love.

she's gonna end up with the wrong guy.

Please.

00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,404

So how'd she manage
to eat so much chocolate?

00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:37,173
Remember that guy, Ted,
that I was telling you about?

258

Well, I came home
and I found him waiting in my apartment...

and chocolates...

- Exactly.
- No, honey. Nobody does that.

00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:14,552

you'd save the date.

before settling down forever.

So now we've gone...

278
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,853
from 'I was never gonna do it'
to 'I need to do this.'

279
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,896
Did I leave the room at some point?
When did that happen?

280
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:38,843
Oh, maybe when you said
you wouldn't let me do it.

281
00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:40,343
I never said that!

282
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:42,099
You know, if you're having
these kind of doubts now,

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,558
Maybe not.

- Pause.
- Pause.

- Totally.

Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster,
you are delicious.

Oh, God, I love butter sauce.
There's nothing bad about it.

291

and butter sauce rivers.

Still funny.

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,091
Still... And now it's sad.

301

Hey, Penelope,
you sure I'm doing this right?

302
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:45,027
I think so.

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:47,966
Does it look anything like a real rain dance?

00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,975
I think so.

Hey, Penelope, have you ever actually seen
a rain dance performed?

306
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:57,349
No.

307
00:14:58,435 --> 00:15:00,798
- No?
- I've read extensively on the subject.

- Dibs.

- Unpause?
- Unpause.

Look, I know this sucks.

322
00:15:45,518 --> 00:15:48,073
It's just something I'm going through.

323
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:53,212
I'm not asking you to understand it.
I'm not asking you to be happy about it.

324
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:56,072
I'm just asking you to support it.

325
00:15:57,744 --> 00:16:00,021
Look, I want to, Lily, okay?

326
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:03,322
I really do. But I just can't.

327
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,820
- Why not?
- Because you're scaring the hell out of me.

328
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:07,672
That's why not.

329
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,363
What if you decide to go be a painter,

330
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,502
and then you realize
I don't fit into your life anymore,

331

and three months becomes forever?

332
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:16,513
Can you promise me that
that's not gonna happen?

333
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,428
- Marshall...
- 'Cause if you can't promise me that,

334
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:19,610
we should just break up right now.

335
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:20,887

337

Marshall, I love you.

338
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:30,559
Can you promise me that
that's not gonna happen?

339
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:32,792
- Pause.
- No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore.

340
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,580
Can you promise me that
that's not gonna happen?

341
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:37,766
- Pause!
- Why do you want me to pause?

342
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,730
That's just a great use
of the pause function, baby.

343
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,739
Thank you.

Hey, Ted, what you doing?

346
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:54,213
A rain dance.

347
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:58,555
Dude, that's not a rain dance.
That's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.

348
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,002
Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit's
a stickler for choreography.

349
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:03,918
It's the thought that counts.

350

She's leaving in half an hour.

Dude, these are your awesome years,
you're wasting them on this girl.

353
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:14,643
- This isn't gonna work.
- Yeah. I know that.

354
00:17:14,738 --> 00:17:17,771
- Well, then why are you doing it?
- Because I love her.

355
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,080
I love her!

356
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:20,963
I told her that the first night we went out,

357
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,548
and here it is, eight months later,
and nothing's changed.

358
00:17:23,644 --> 00:17:26,549
So, yes, I know this isn't gonna work.

359
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,558
But it has to work!

Give me some rain!

363

Oh, thank God you're here.

I know. I'm sorry.

377
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:46,989
- It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

378
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,202
Come down here.

379
00:18:48,297 --> 00:18:50,149
It's pouring. You come up.

No, you have to come down here.

- Why?
- Why?

382
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,745
Because I made it rain.
That's what I did today.

383
00:18:57,841 --> 00:19:02,151
And that's enough.
I've done my part, now get down here!

I'm not dressed, Ted. You come up.

I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not.
