1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,005
- My name is barry allen,
and I'm the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,639
When I was a child,
I saw my mother

3
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:08,941
Killed by something impossible.

4
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:10,309
- Run, barry, run!

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:13,012
- My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:16,849
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,183
To the outside world,

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,618
I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,354
But secretly I use my speed
to fight crime

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,989
And find others like me,

11
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:26,592
And one day I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,161
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:31,930
I am the flash.

14
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,832
- Previously on <i>the flash...</i>

15
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,434
- Ronnie!

16
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:38,137
- 17 people died that night;
many more were injured.

17
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,539
I'm not the most popular person
in town these days.

18
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,341
- We're just supposed to
get used to working

19
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:44,443
Above a makeshift prison

20
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,945
Housing evil people
with superpowers.

21
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,480
- What is this?

22
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,682
- Somewhere you'll never
hurt anyone ever again.

23
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,485
[upbeat music]

24
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,156
[laughter]

25
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:59,291
- Farooq!
- It's not safe.

26
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,093
Come down.

27
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,394
Farooq, I'm serious.

28
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,662
It's gonna rain.

29
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:04,997
- Y'all are tripping.

30
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,732
This is the best seat
in the house.

31
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,000
Whoo!

32
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,668
- You know, when I said
we should watch

33
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,270
The particle accelerator
turn on,

34
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:16,141
I just meant we should get naked
and howl at the moon.

35
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,709
- It's already on.

36
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,044
Consider me unimpressed.

37
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,413
[distant boom]

38
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,414
- Whoo!

39
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,415
Yeah, baby.

40
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,686
- Oh.

41
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:30,756
- This is awesome.
- Are you seeing this?

42
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:34,093
Oh, man,
I think I am tripping.

43
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:35,727
Oh, man.

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,507
- Get in the car!

45
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,541
Get in the car!

46
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,916
[electricity crackling]

47
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:58,917
- Farooq!

48
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,721
- Farooq!
- Farooq!

49
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,599
[screams]

50
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,857
- Good day, dr. Wells.

51
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,926
- One can always hope, gideon.

52
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:42,161
Bring up my log, would you?

53
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:44,096
- Certainly.

54
00:02:44,098 --> 00:02:45,764
Go ahead, doctor.

55
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,166
- New entry.

56
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,269
It has now been 311 days
since lightning struck.

57
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:54,840
Subject has begun relying
on his speed in everyday life,

58
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:59,444
Using his extraordinary powers
to solve ordinary problems...

59
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,313
[alarm beeping]

60
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:03,048
- I'm late.

61
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:07,152
- And accomplish ordinary tasks.

62
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:11,390
Unfortunately, his penchant
for the heroic persists.

63
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,025
- I hate it
when they let the new guy train

64
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,826
During the morning rush.

65
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:22,201
[people talking at once]

66
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,503
- Did you get one too?
- Yeah.

67
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,004
- Wow.

68
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,074
- The fact is...

69
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,309
- Don't try nothing.

70
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,710
- He can be a bit of a showoff.

71
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,246
- Wallet.
Now.

72
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,014
- Oh, this is awesome.
You've got to be kidding me.

73
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,482
Hold on, okay?
I'm just gonna--

74
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,917
I'm gonna set this down.

75
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,686
[laughs]
I mean, this is crazy.

76
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,987
There are literally
hundreds of thousands

77
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,822
Of people in central city,

78
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:46,825
And out of everyone you could
have picked to rob, you pick me.

79
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,328
- What, are you sick?
Money, now.

80
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,797
- I just--you're really gonna
be kicking yourself, man.

81
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,999
I mean, if there was an olympics
for bad luck,

82
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,500
You didn't just medal, pal.

83
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,302
You michael phelps-ed.

84
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:59,638
- I'll count to three.
Then I'm gonna shoot you.

85
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,139
One...
- Yeah.

86
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:02,774
[gun cocks]
- two.

87
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:11,717
- And while his desire
to help others is commendable,

88
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,586
It is impeding him
from realizing the full scope

89
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,288
Of his abilities.

90
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,959
But there's still time,

91
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,895
As the future remains intact.

92
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,869
Where's barry?
He's late.

93
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,639
- Late is kind of
his signature move.

94
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,541
- Hey, you guys
want to see my signature move?

95
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,613
- Sorry, guys,
I got a little held up.

96
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,884
You had to be there.

97
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,553
- I'm gonna need a moment
or two alone with barry.

98
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:56,361
- Ooh, you're in trouble.

99
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:59,564
- Now, may I remind you,
mr. Allen, we had an agreement.

100
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:01,366
We would help with your heroics
out there

101
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,001
While you would help us
research and develop

102
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,271
Your abilities in here, right?

103
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,306
- Yeah.
No, I know.

104
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,007
I-I guess I've just

105
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,676
Gotten a little caught up
with being able to help people,

106
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,677
You know, put bad guys away.

107
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,878
It feels good.

108
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,513
- Imagine how good
it will feel

109
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,948
To cure diseases, stop aging,
reverse paralysis.

110
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,884
- All good causes.

111
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,952
So how can I help you do that?

112
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,221
You need more mris,
more blood, or--

113
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,957
- I need more speed.
- Okay.

114
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,327
- Speed is the key to progress.

115
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,861
[cell phone vibrates]

116
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,799
You need to kick it up a notch.

117
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:36,468
- There was a homicide.

118
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,803
I'm sorry.
I've got to go.

119
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,805
- This is not just about you.

120
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,541
Remember that, barry.

121
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,775
- Yeah.

122
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,019
[exhales]

123
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,823
I hope you both skipped
your breakfast.

124
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,324
- Whoa.

125
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,293
- What the hell could do that?

126
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:04,996
- 2,400 degrees,
give or take.

127
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,898
- This area's filled
with combustibles.

128
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,668
How come nothing else burned up?

129
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,436
Where you going?

130
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,005
- You see the soot on the ground
where the cement is burnt?

131
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,442
- Yeah.
- That's evidence of arc blasts.

132
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,111
Happens when
high-amperage currents

133
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,780
Travel or arc through the air.

134
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:22,848
- There's no live wires.

135
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,250
There's no utility poles.

136
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:27,085
- So how was this guy
electrocuted?

137
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,424
- Well, the first thing
we need to do is I.D. Him.

138
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,725
- Yeah.

139
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,827
His face is melted off.

140
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,230
How's that picture
gonna help I.D. Him?

141
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,831
- I got mad skills.

142
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,933
- Please don't ever
say that again.

143
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,201
- All right.

144
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,572
Hey, are you okay?

145
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,040
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?

146
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,509
- I don't know.
You seem a little off.

147
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,249
- No, I'm fine.
- All right.

148
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,921
- Facial recognition software--

149
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,890
It's designed for archeologists,

150
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:07,426
And it should help us I.D.
Your crispy corpse.

151
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,628
- The question is, how did he
get fried in the first place?

152
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,330
Is there a metahuman out there
that can control electricity?

153
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:14,132
- It'd take a serious
electrostatic discharge

154
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:16,101
To cause that level
of tissue damage.

155
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,836
- Guys,
according to the software,

156
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,640
There's an 82% chance
your victim looked like this.

157
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:23,241
- 82%?

158
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,610
- Hey, it was zero
when you walked in here, pal.

159
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,412
- Can you cross-reference that
with the dmv database,

160
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,647
Maybe get a name?

161
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,081
- Absolutely.

162
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,683
This software can do
just about anything

163
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,585
Now that felicity
reprogrammed it.

164
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,786
Casey donahue.

165
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,621
No wife. No kids.

166
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,124
Used to work at the petersburg
electrical substation.

167
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,493
- That can't be a coincidence.
- That's weird.

168
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,663
Someone just used his I.D.
To enter the substation.

169
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,665
- The petersburg grid
is experiencing a power drain

170
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,099
Right now.

171
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,101
- Barry, be...

172
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,436
Careful.

173
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,313
[electricity crackling]

174
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:11,022
- I'm pretty sure
this is a restricted area.

175
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,068
Easy there, zappy.

176
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,637
- I have to feed.

177
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,183
- Whoa, what was that?

178
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,193
- More of that.

179
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,528
I need more.

180
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,897
- Barry, what's happening?

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,002
- [screams]

182
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,715
- Too much.

183
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,217
Too much.

184
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,252
- Get out of there.

185
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,958
Run, barry.

186
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,564
- I can't.

187
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,632
My speed...

188
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,634
Is gone.

189
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,216
- He runs slow
even for a normal person.

190
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:47,752
- You can't just
lose your powers, okay?

191
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,555
Your dna was transformed by
the particle accelerator blast.

192
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,924
There's no way
to untransform dna.

193
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,926
- Yeah, tell that
to the uber driver

194
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,128
Who charged me 65 bucks
to take me here.

195
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,097
I had to tell her I was coming
from a cosplay party.

196
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,632
- So we were wrong.

197
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,434
This metahuman
doesn't electrocute people;

198
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:06,371
He siphons electricity,
thereby removing your power.

199
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:10,875
- All right, do we think
this is temporary or--

200
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:13,478
- We have to run tests.

201
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,046
- Yeah.

202
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,448
I've got to warn joe.

203
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:23,288
- Barry, we will find a way
to restore your speed.

204
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,289
I promise you that.

205
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,375
- You didn't catch it.
- I loved that mug.

206
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:44,876
And what part
of "a metahuman stole my speed"

207
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,444
Didn't you understand?

208
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,246
- Barry, there's no part
of anything you can do

209
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,749
That I ever understand.

210
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,283
What does dr. Wells say?

211
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:53,718
- He's working on it.

212
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,121
- Barry, you have to get
your speed back.

213
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,589
People in this city
need protecting,

214
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,291
And if you don't get your speed,

215
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,093
How the hell
are we gonna keep them safe?

216
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,695
- Joe, the meta
who stole my speed,

217
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,131
He burned up the body
we saw in the alley today.

218
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,099
You need to tell the police
not to confront him.

219
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,468
He's dangerous.
- Who's dangerous?

220
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,604
- No one, just some thief.

221
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:15,874
- Well, criminals
better watch out.

222
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,376
Cops in central city
are the best there are,

223
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,145
And if you can't
protect this city, dad,

224
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,647
I know the flash will.

225
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,049
- What if he can't?

226
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,451
What if he's gone?

227
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:27,819
- Gone?

228
00:11:27,821 --> 00:11:29,454
- Yeah, or maybe he's just done,

229
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,589
Or maybe it's like
whatever he could do before,

230
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,590
He can't do anymore.

231
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,792
- Huh?
- Barry?

232
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,361
Don't you have
someplace to be?

233
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,629
- Yeah, going.

234
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,868
- Aw, barry loved that mug.

235
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,754
- That's a quality
time piece, young man.

236
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:06,224
- Oh, uh, thanks.

237
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,226
- They took mine,

238
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,195
All of them.

239
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:11,329
- I guess
you shouldn't have done

240
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,931
Whatever it is you did.

241
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,671
- Come on.

242
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,743
- Gideon, show me the future.

243
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,077
- Certainly, doctor.

244
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,916
- Run a complete search.

245
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,052
Show any references
to the flash.

246
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,587
- Zero references to the flash.

247
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,888
- Look again.

248
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,189
- Zero references.

249
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,024
- Show any references
to barry allen.

250
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,726
- Zero references
to barry allen.

251
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,261
- Look again!

252
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,698
- I've searched 3,452 times,
dr. Wells.

253
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,533
There's nothing.

254
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,375
- You think I'll ever
wear it again?

255
00:12:57,377 --> 00:13:01,012
- I hope so.

256
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:05,283
- I didn't have my speed
for very long,

257
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:10,155
But now that it's gone, it feels
like part of me is gone too.

258
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:14,726
- With or without your speed,
you're still you, barry.

259
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:16,628
- But I'm not.

260
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,464
I'm not the best version of me.

261
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,633
I love being the flash.

262
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,104
I love everything about it:

263
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:29,507
The feeling of running
hundreds of miles per hour,

264
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,678
Wind and power
just rushing past my face,

265
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,280
Being able to help people.

266
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,819
I'm not sure
I can live without it, caitlin.

267
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,557
- Farooq gibran.
- Who?

268
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,725
- The powers vampire
who jacked your speed.

269
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,960
I hacked into
the surveillance footage

270
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,562
From the petersburg substation.

271
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,330
Once I got his face,
it was easy to find a match.

272
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,798
- He climbed an electrical tower

273
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,500
The night
of the accelerator explosion.

274
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,569
- No surprise
where his powers came from.

275
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,572
[alarm beeping]

276
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,677
- Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

277
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,078
This is not happening.

278
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,346
- Dr. Harrison wells,

279
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,848
I need to see you!

280
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,150
Come on,
I know you're inside.

281
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:14,018
Open the door.

282
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,654
I just want to talk, dr. Wells.

283
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,389
Wells!

284
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,691
Let me in!

285
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,529
- Joe.

286
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,231
Hello, iris.

287
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,233
I am out.

288
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,301
I need you to cover for me
until the shift change.

289
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,369
Only one headline,

290
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,838
Prison transfer,
william tockman.

291
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,514
[electricity crackling]

292
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,524
[gunshot]
[people scream]

293
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,426
- Guns on the floor!

294
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,628
It should take you
less than three seconds

295
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,798
To discard any thought
of rebellion and comply.

296
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,404
I take it I don't need to
count out loud.

297
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,072
[gunshot]

298
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,144
Hmm.

299
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,412
Striking resemblance.

300
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:51,649
[electricity crackling]

301
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,592
[electricity crackling]

302
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,964
- He's inside.

303
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,176
- Captain,

304
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,811
Tockman has
at least ten hostages.

305
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:23,781
Two officers down.

306
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:25,683
- Copy that.
When is the power back?

307
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,118
- We're on gennies for now.

308
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,554
[cell phone rings]

309
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,089
- Not now.
- Wait.

310
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,924
Captain singh,
I've been trying to get in touch

311
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,994
With joe or anyone
at the precinct.

312
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,429
- There's a hostage situation,
barry,

313
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:39,430
And joe's inside.

314
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,800
So's his daughter.

315
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:43,935
I'll call you when I know more.

316
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:45,336
- Wait--
[line clicks]

317
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,474
Joe and iris are in trouble.

318
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,142
I need my powers back now.

319
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,177
- I have a theory.

320
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,312
It's untested.

321
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,680
- I'm willing to roll the dice.

322
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,782
- Okay,
you've lost your speed, yes,

323
00:16:57,784 --> 00:17:00,451
But nothing has changed
inside you on a subatomic level.

324
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:03,755
In other words,
your cells are still primed.

325
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,323
- They just need a jumpstart.

326
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,924
- Okay, how do we do that?
How do we jumpstart me?

327
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,926
- We need to replicate
the initial jolt to your system.

328
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,062
- But that would mean
a peak current

329
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,930
Of at least 20,000 kilo-amps.

330
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,665
- Are you insane?

331
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:16,167
That's more electricity than
they give to people

332
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,535
In the electric chair.

333
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,103
- Caitlin,
with farooq in the building,

334
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,571
We're all looking
at a death sentence here.

335
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,006
- The spare generator's offline.

336
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,208
If we reboot it,
we could get a charge that big.

337
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,110
- We need something
that can transmit the load

338
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,779
From the generator
to barry's body

339
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,080
Without shorting out.

340
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,181
- The treadmill.

341
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,682
My baby could take the charge.

342
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,184
- What if barry can't?

343
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:34,552
- Well, that's up to mr. Allen.

344
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,555
- Where are you going?

345
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,159
- I'm gonna talk to him.

346
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,760
- No. No.

347
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:45,363
- Okay, you didn't see him
at the substation.

348
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,165
He needed to feed.

349
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,767
I got super speed out of
the particle accelerator blast,

350
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,035
But his best friends died.

351
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,603
He woke up with a disease.

352
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,872
- Earlier today,
you worked a crime scene

353
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,341
Where this metahuman
electrocuted an innocent man.

354
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,943
He's a murderer!

355
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:03,247
And you are powerless
to defend yourself against him.

356
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,149
- He may just need help
like I did.

357
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:07,452
I don't need my powers
to offer him that.

358
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:08,953
I have to try.

359
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,126
- Tockman?

360
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,894
Tockman.

361
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:17,962
Tockman!

362
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,330
- I am presently in control

363
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,233
Of eight
of central city's finest,

364
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:23,801
Three underpaid assistants,

365
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,070
And one very brave
civilian girl.

366
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,672
- You've got demands;
I want to hear them.

367
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,408
But first let the civilians go.

368
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,145
- Would you prefer
I sent them out alive or dead?

369
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,746
Please be more specific.

370
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:39,484
One helicopter,
one vegetarian takeout meal,

371
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,453
One laptop
with eight gigabytes of ram

372
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,390
Will be delivered on this roof
at exactly 53 minutes

373
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,793
And 27 seconds from now,

374
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,429
Or I shoot a hostage.

375
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,631
- There is a citywide blackout.

376
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,433
I'm gonna need more time.

377
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:59,837
- Captain, you may delay,
but time will not.

378
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,540
- Benjamin franklin.

379
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:04,542
- Very good, detective.

380
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:10,715
- Hey, whoa, whoa.

381
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,316
Whoa, whoa, easy.

382
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,186
I'm not gonna hurt you.

383
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,054
- You can't hurt me.

384
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,223
Where is harrison wells?

385
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:21,325
- Look,
I know what happened to you.

386
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,895
The night of the accelerator
explosion, it changed you.

387
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,531
It changed me too.

388
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,404
- You were the one
in the red suit.

389
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,506
- I fed from you.

390
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,074
I have to keep feeding.

391
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,011
- All right, I know
this has to be terrifying.

392
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:44,015
That's why I want to help you,
okay?

393
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,717
- The night of the explosion,
when the light hit me,

394
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,986
It stopped my heart.

395
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,688
Jake and darya--

396
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,123
- They were your friends.

397
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:55,059
- I woke up,
and they were beside me, dead.

398
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,527
They tried to give me cpr.

399
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,631
They were touching me,
and I electrocuted them.

400
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,002
- This is not your fault.

401
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,240
- I know.

402
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,378
Wells did this to me.

403
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,550
- Farooq,
you need to listen to me.

404
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,029
- Not sure
how long that will hold.

405
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,232
- Done being noble, mr. Allen?

406
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,634
Caitlin, get him
to the treadmill.

407
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,337
Cisco,
bring the generator online.

408
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,172
Make sure barry gets the charge.

409
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:44,008
- What?
You're not coming with me?

410
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,077
I am not leaving you.

411
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,012
- Listen to me.

412
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:50,047
Of everything
I've done in my life,

413
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,482
Of everything I have invented,

414
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:54,518
My most important creation
is the flash.

415
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,021
Barry allen must have a future.

416
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,723
Now, go.

417
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,558
Go!

418
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,133
- End this now,
and I'll talk to the d.A.

419
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,072
- It was your district attorney
that denied me furlough

420
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:20,444
So I could visit my dying sister
one last time,

421
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,246
Say good-bye to her in person.

422
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,316
That's time I'll never get back!

423
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,956
So however long
I have in this life,

424
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:38,262
I promise not one second more
will be spent in a prison cell.

425
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,297
[gunshot]

426
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,298
- Got him.

427
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,299
[gunshots]
- eddie!

428
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,867
[screams]

429
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,707
Eddie.
Eddie, eddie.

430
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,909
- An officer was just shot
9.2 seconds ago.

431
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:55,579
I'd pick up the pace in meeting
my demands, captain.

432
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,655
- I'm not healing fast anymore.

433
00:22:07,426 --> 00:22:09,927
That's unfortunate.
- Don't worry.

434
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,030
When dr. Wells has a theory,
he's usually right.

435
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,800
- What if something happens
to joe and iris first?

436
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,804
[electricity crackling]

437
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,799
- Come to check on your pet?

438
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:50,835
Why don't you just kill me, huh?

439
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,938
Get it over with.

440
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,640
- Quid pro quo.

441
00:22:56,642 --> 00:22:58,709
That's latin, mr. Woodward.

442
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,177
You've heard of latin?

443
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,079
Quid pro quo means something
for something,

444
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:05,583
And in this case
that something is your freedom.

445
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:08,219
I'm prepared to grant it to you.

446
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,822
- How do you know
I won't kill you?

447
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,224
- Let's call that
a calculated risk,

448
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:14,425
One I'm willing to take.

449
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,193
- Really?
- That's right.

450
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:17,561
- Why would you do that?

451
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,164
- Because there is
another metahuman

452
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,266
Loose in this facility.

453
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,737
I want you to kill him.

454
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,055
[electricity crackling]

455
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,401
- Did you know the human body
generates electricity?

456
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:01,605
The average person
gives off 342 watts,

457
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,541
And I can smell it
coming from you.

458
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,544
[suspenseful music]

459
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:13,250
â™ª

460
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:15,820
[electricity crackling]

461
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,001
- Turn on the treadmill.
- You're still hurt.

462
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,970
- We don't have time!

463
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,815
- Been dying to punch somebody.

464
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,629
Ouch.

465
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:00,297
- Caitlin!
- I can't.

466
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,799
- We don't have a choice.

467
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,701
- If I turn this on,
it could kill you.

468
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,302
- If you don't,
we could all die.

469
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,638
- I already lost someone
I cared about in this building.

470
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,906
I can't do it again.

471
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,578
- Listen, someone once told me

472
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,914
That I was struck by that
lightning for a reason,

473
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,216
That it chose me.

474
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,552
I'm not sure I believe it.

475
00:25:21,554 --> 00:25:23,854
Right now, it doesn't matter
what I believe.

476
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,994
What do you believe?

477
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,004
Come on.

478
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,151
- [grunts]
- my god, are you okay?

479
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,819
Did you feel anything?

480
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,929
- It didn't work.

481
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:07,932
[loud boom]

482
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,769
- Please, he's bleeding.

483
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:13,470
You have to let us
get him some help.

484
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,239
- You'll stay where you are.

485
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,341
- And while you're killing time,
he's bleeding out.

486
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,943
- [laughs]

487
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,946
As if you could kill time
without wounding eternity.

488
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,380
- Henry david thoreau.

489
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,282
- Ooh, good.

490
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,525
A little battlefield trick.

491
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,360
- Eddie.

492
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:39,597
- [screams]

493
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,202
- If he lives long enough
to receive medical treatment,

494
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:48,439
They'll know the exact time
the tourniquet was applied.

495
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,876
What?
No "thank you"?

496
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:55,579
- They call you the clock king,
right?

497
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:57,982
- A somewhat florid appellation,

498
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:00,484
But I've grown to see
the humor in it.

499
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,052
- You're going back to prison.

500
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,821
- Really?
[laughs]

501
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,522
And--and how do you reckon?

502
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,491
- Because the flash is coming.

503
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:08,492
- Oh.

504
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,330
- Oh, where are you?

505
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:19,269
[electricity crackling]

506
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,508
- Tony.

507
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,010
Hey, tony, what are you doing?

508
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,779
- Oh, come on.
You know me, allen.

509
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:30,848
I never run from a fight.

510
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:33,617
- All right,
well, stay with me, okay?

511
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,987
You're good.

512
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,156
- Run.

513
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,524
- What?

514
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,093
Hey, tony.

515
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,633
No.

516
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:50,934
- [gasps]
barry.

517
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,475
[helicopter blades whirring]

518
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,745
- Early.

519
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,451
You ever seen the city
at night by helicopter?

520
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,053
It's quite spectacular.

521
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,562
- You're winded.
That's not good.

522
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,731
- I need to take your blood
and figure out what happened.

523
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,268
- I can't believe he's dead.

524
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,103
- Dr. Wells?

525
00:28:26,105 --> 00:28:28,672
- No, no.
Tony woodward.

526
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,174
- He escaped from the pipeline.

527
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,909
- He must have got out
when the blackout hit.

528
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,610
- Not possible.

529
00:28:33,612 --> 00:28:35,412
The pipeline was designed
to withstand a power outage.

530
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:36,613
Someone had to have let him go.

531
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,517
- I did.

532
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,020
I released him.

533
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,388
- Why?

534
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,856
- To divert
our intruder's attention

535
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,524
While we worked
to restore your speed.

536
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,259
- You used him as a distraction?

537
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,728
- An unnecessary one,
as it turns out.

538
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,396
It seems the plan has failed.

539
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,699
- I--

540
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,739
I have his blood on me.

541
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,307
How could you do that?

542
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,008
- You're showing a lot
of sentiment for a man

543
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,510
Who tormented you as a child.

544
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,178
- Tony might have been
a bully then and now,

545
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,880
But he didn't deserve to die.

546
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:12,916
- Does caitlin or cisco or me

547
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,118
Or you?

548
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,986
I had a choice to make,
him or us.

549
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,921
I chose us
without a second thought.

550
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,324
- Well, all your talk
about miracle cures

551
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:21,658
And scientific breakthroughs,

552
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,228
But you don't care about people
at all.

553
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,629
- Well, maybe you care too much,
barry.

554
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:27,097
I know being a hero
is important to you,

555
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,632
And I respect your ideals.

556
00:29:28,634 --> 00:29:30,667
I just don't have the luxury
of sharing them.

557
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:31,802
- I forgot.

558
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,071
Your game's chess.

559
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:38,175
We're all just pawns to you,
right?

560
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:41,411
So what's your move, doctor?

561
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,514
Which one of us
gets sacrificed next?

562
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,994
[electricity crackling]

563
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,299
- We have to get
out of the facility.

564
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,001
- We just left him on d level.

565
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,503
- We'll never make it
to the main entrance from here.

566
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:09,072
- What about the garage,
the mobile lab van?

567
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,607
- It's my move, mr. Allen,

568
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,976
And I say we make a run for it.

569
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,645
- Oh, my god.
Barry, look.

570
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,414
Your cells, they're rapidly
regenerating.

571
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,288
- I still don't have my speed.

572
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,225
- It must be mental,
not physical.

573
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:31,428
- Oh, you have the yips.

574
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,330
- The whats?
- You know.

575
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:35,399
When a second baseman all of
a sudden can't throw to first

576
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,067
Or a golfer tries to putt

577
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:39,069
And they get all embarrassed
and upset,

578
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,137
And then that makes
the yips worse,

579
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,672
And it's a hot mess,

580
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,674
And then they feel
like even more of a failure.

581
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,175
- That's not helping.

582
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,913
- Look, you asked
if I believed

583
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,815
You were struck by lightning
for a reason,

584
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:53,817
If you were chosen.

585
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:55,152
I believe.

586
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:56,687
You should too.

587
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,057
[loud boom]

588
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,124
- Let's move.

589
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,964
- Tockman, no.

590
00:31:06,966 --> 00:31:08,298
No, don't do this,
not her.

591
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,867
No, take me, please.

592
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,402
- Something tells me you
will not be a docile passenger.

593
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,671
She will.
- Dad. Dad.

594
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:17,841
- Wait, wait!
Let her say good-bye.

595
00:31:17,843 --> 00:31:21,545
This is her boyfriend
lying here dying,

596
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:26,350
And I think you and me both know
that he probably won't make it.

597
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,552
It's wrong that you didn't get
to say good-bye to your sister.

598
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,220
Give them what you deserved.

599
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,894
- You have 20 seconds.

600
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:41,331
- Eddie. Eddie.

601
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,666
- Sorry, babe.

602
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,301
- No, please.

603
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:46,303
You have to hang on
for me, okay?

604
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,905
I'm gonna be right back.

605
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,543
- [whispers]

606
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,224
- Let's go.

607
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,365
- Second van, keys are inside.

608
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,402
Come on.

609
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:19,403
[engine turns over]

610
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,238
Get in!
Come on!

611
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,916
Come on.

612
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,718
- He's here.

613
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:46,596
- Barry.

614
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,231
- Quickly.

615
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,400
Time and tide wait for no man.

616
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,639
- Wait, let her say good-bye.

617
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,207
- You have 20 seconds.

618
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,376
- Ankle holster.

619
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,446
[gun cocks]

620
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:05,882
[gunshot]

621
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,285
- Iris!

622
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,286
- Oh, my god, are you okay?

623
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,554
- I'm okay.
Come on.

624
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,856
- Did he hit you?
- I'm okay.

625
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,091
Guys.

626
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,826
- Oh, my god.

627
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:17,027
Oh, my god.
No, please.

628
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,028
- Hey!

629
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,165
You're here for me.

630
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,437
- Finally you show your face.

631
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:31,008
- Well, I wasn't exactly eager
to be killed.

632
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,944
- Neither were my friends.

633
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:35,379
- I know.

634
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,847
I hurt a lot of people
that night.

635
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,015
- People?

636
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,850
You don't even know their names.

637
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,285
- Jake davenport.

638
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,788
Darya kim.

639
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,024
Ralph dibny, al rothstein,

640
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:49,526
Grant emerson, will everett,

641
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:53,630
Bea da costa, ronnie raymond.

642
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,667
I know the names of every person
who died that night.

643
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,469
I know they all mattered,

644
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,339
And the fact that the world is
now deprived of their potential

645
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,341
Is something that I have to
live with every day,

646
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:07,611
But these people--these people
have done nothing wrong.

647
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:08,912
You want to punish me?

648
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:12,949
Fine, let's do that,

649
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:14,451
But let these people live.

650
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,091
- You died that night too.

651
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,593
[electricity crackling]

652
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,328
- No!

653
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,431
- You just didn't know it
till today.

654
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,937
- [screaming]

655
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:28,024
[panting]

656
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,997
Iris.

657
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,606
[indistinct radio chatter]

658
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,978
- We could have called him
"blackout."

659
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,314
- He had a name, cisco.

660
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:26,082
- I'm just not sure
what happened.

661
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:30,086
Why didn't he just siphon
all my powers like before?

662
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,323
- Because you finally stopped
thinking about your powers

663
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,192
And just connected to them.

664
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,127
Look, this is a sample
of your blood

665
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:39,162
From just after you were struck
by lightning.

666
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:43,900
Now your cells are generating
more energy than ever before.

667
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:48,004
It was more energy than the meta
could safely handle.

668
00:36:48,006 --> 00:36:49,806
It's almost like
he choked on you.

669
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,708
- But what does that mean?

670
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,177
- It means you've
kicked it up a notch.

671
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,256
- Dr. Wells.

672
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:10,193
What I said about how you don't
care about people, I--

673
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:13,430
- No, look, barry.

674
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:19,569
There is a reason that
my biography describes me

675
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:24,741
As arrogant, prickly, brusque--

676
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,309
- "at times contemptuous."

677
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,379
I read it twice.
- You were right.

678
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:30,981
I don't care much for people,
barry.

679
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,883
I find them misinformed,
shortsighted.

680
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,051
- So why do you do what you do?

681
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,453
Why get up in the morning?

682
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,655
- Because I believe
in a better future,

683
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40,557
One that I very much
want to see,

684
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,058
One that you are a part of.

685
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,795
I might not much care
for people, barry,

686
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:48,798
But I care about you.

687
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,242
- Trauma team to the nicu.
Trauma team to the nicu.

688
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,611
[knocks]

689
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,546
- Hey, allen.

690
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,681
- Hey, eddie.

691
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:06,683
- Flowers.

692
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:10,353
That's so nice.
[giggles]

693
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:12,322
- Where were you all night?

694
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:15,859
- Home, trying to eat all
the ice cream before it melted.

695
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,295
- I love ice cream.
[laughs]

696
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,697
- He is on pain meds,
lots of them,

697
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:23,300
But he's gonna be okay.

698
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,501
It's been some night.

699
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,869
I am gonna get some coffee.

700
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:26,970
I'll be back.

701
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,143
- Dude.

702
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,049
- Awesome.

703
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:41,017
I guess you're feeling better.

704
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,720
- Oh, yeah.

705
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:44,821
- Did you guys see that?

706
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,827
- You're just high, partner.

707
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:53,196
- Right, I forgot.
[laughs]

708
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,539
- Oh, now you show up.

709
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,774
- I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you today.

710
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:08,211
It couldn't be helped.
- It's okay.

711
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:11,247
A girl's got to be her own hero
every now and again.

712
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:14,250
- I promise I'll never
be late again.

713
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:15,885
- My best friend
is always saying that,

714
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:17,854
And he is always late.

715
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,859
- You're worth being
on time for.

716
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,270
- Honey, you all right?

717
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,939
- Yeah, why?

718
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,607
- You forgot your coffee.

719
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,678
- Oh, uh...

720
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,185
- Good day, dr. Wells.

721
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,720
- Yes, it is, gideon.

722
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,522
Bring up my log, please,
new entry.

723
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:56,593
It has now been 312 days
since lightning struck.

724
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,695
In the past 24 hours,

725
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,030
Subject has taken
a great leap forward,

726
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:05,034
Causing me to revise
my initial thesis.

727
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:09,239
I thought--well, I thought
his attachment to people

728
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:12,776
Was a distraction
slowing down his progress.

729
00:40:12,778 --> 00:40:15,945
Now I realize
the opposite is true.

730
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:21,518
Barry's attachment to people,
the people he cares about,

731
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,522
Is actually the key
to getting him up to speed.

732
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:28,958
In the meantime,
good news.

733
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,062
The future remains intact.

734
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,835
You're early.

735
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,069
- Yeah, I know.

736
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,105
It feels weird to me too.

737
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,842
- I thought after yesterday,
you'd want to sleep in.

738
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:48,578
- Can't.
There's too much work to do.

739
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,280
I'm ready to do it.

740
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:51,948
I want to push myself,

741
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,984
Find out how fast
I can really go.

742
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,886
You were right.

743
00:40:56,888 --> 00:41:00,089
This is not just about me.

744
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,925
- Let's get to work.

745
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,099
Now, you...

746
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,172
Had the ability
to steal the flash's powers,

747
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,907
And I...

748
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:02,051
Would love to know...

749
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:03,419
How you did that.

750
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,143
- Greg, move your head.
