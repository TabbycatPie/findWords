1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,740
If I take something to help me sleep,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,130
I'll be groggy for the meeting.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:08,500
But if I don't take anything and I don't sleep,

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,400
I'll be groggy for the meeting, you know?

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,500
I was up for re-election as social chair

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,140
of our local realtors group.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,720
The vote was tonight.

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,610
I was so nervous,

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,010
I could barely hear Claire's pep talk.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,990
Why did I beg Mitchell

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,770
to introduce me to this developer?

12
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,500
You're right. We'll know soon enough.

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,570
I'm gonna go upstairs, see if I can get some sleep.

14
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,650
Love you.

15
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,100
I hope so, too.

16
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,680
Hello?

17
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,880
Hey, Gil.

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,670
No, no, no. You -- you didn't wake me.

19
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,490
Um, so, you hear anything, or...

20
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,330
Hey, Dunphy.

21
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,200
Just wrapping up a phone call with this jackass.

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,890
I got to run, Dunphy.

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,830
I got a late meeting with some jackass.

24
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,770
What's going o-- what's going on?

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,680
The people have spoken, Dunphy.

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,230
I'm in. You're out.

27
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,200
Sorry to have to tell you that in private.

28
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,480
Was it even close?

29
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,630
No! I have a mandate --

30
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,550
Not the kind you hide from your wife, either.

31
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,960
I can't believe it. I'm a one-termer?

32
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,980
That puts me alongside Henry Eustace Tyler

33
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,300
and Art Wagner!

34
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,580
Never met Art Wagner.

35
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,340
They took away his realtor's license after Gategate.

36
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,310
Okay, enough history, "Done-for."

37
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,780
Fork over the hardware.

38
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,890
Gil, as my predecessor told me,

39
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,240
respect the office, respect the medallion.

40
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,140
Ooh, shiny.

41
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,400
How often do you clean this thing?

42
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,780
Every time I shower.

43
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,010
Well, don't worry. It's gonna get a good buffing tonight

44
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,000
when it's swinging against the back of my wife's head.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,690
That is not respecting the medall--

So, after we pick up my allergy medication,

51
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,850
you drop Manny and I at the museum.

52
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,190
Why do you even have to go?

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,790
Ay, other mothers are going to the field trip, too.

54
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,730
Don't worry.

55
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm not going to be all over you,

56
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,460
trying to suffocate you.

57
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,740
Don't talk like that.

58
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,160
I hate crowded elevators.

59
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,940
Only one thing worse --

60
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,230
When they stop and you get trapped.

61
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,200
Actually, there's one thing even worse than that.

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,250
It's okay, sir. There's no need to panic.

63
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,940
Getting trapped with him.

64
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,270
I don't even know the guy's name.

65
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,310
He belongs to my club.

66
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,920
But for whatever reason,

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,870
he has the knack for showing up

68
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,900
when I'm at my absolute worst.

69
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,060
Be right back.

70
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,510
Here, let me help you.

71
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,640
Maybe we should help someone else.

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,880
Oh, don't be frightened.

73
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,850
Big step!

74
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,570
Who's next?

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,010
I'm sorry. Pepper's getting a what for your wedding?

76
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,130
A D.P.

77
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,330
No!

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,090
No, a director of photography.

79
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,610
Yeah, apparently, he's a big deal.

80
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,690
He won a Golden Globe.

81
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,520
No, you win an Oscar.

82
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,130
You buy a Golden Globe.

83
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,140
So he can only meet with us this morning.

84
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,260
Is -- is there any way you could pick Lily up from school?

85
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,340
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I can.

86
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,030
I'll -- I-I'll take her to the park. That's good.

87
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,790
It'll get my mind off this meeting with your friend.

88
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,770
I am so nervous.

89
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,170
I haven't had a sales meeting in...forever.

90
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,330
I'm a little rusty.

91
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,760
Do you remember when we used to call you "Little rusty"?

92
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,440
I was 8,

93
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,170
and I can still cancel this meeting.

94
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,590
Fine. I got to go. I got to --

95
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,170
I don't know what I have to do.

96
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,380
What is this?

97
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,630
I'm sweating off weight for my wrestling match.

98
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,890
I slept in this.

99
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,390
Does this have anything to do with why we're out of plastic wrap?

100
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,740
Oh, it's the bottom layer.

101
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,890
And I've got some news for you --

102
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,940
It's not keeping me fresh.

103
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,390
Okay. Um, you're gonna be late.

104
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,210
You got to get undressed in the backseat.

105
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,840
Ooh, got any pointers for him?

106
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
Do you girls have to move that now?

107
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,190
Well, I've been lonely.

108
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,370
Having a mirror in my room will be like having company!

109
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,050
Ugh, your daughter's a parakeet.

110
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,470
Careful.

111
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,270
Stop saying that. I think I know what I'm --

112
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,150
Oh, one second.

113
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,000
- Oh, my God.  - Hello!

114
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,840
No, this is a good time.

115
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,890
- Haley!  - All right. Geez!

116
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,670
No, I just got to help my sister out with something.

117
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,830
Okay. Bye.

118
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,210
Okay, let's just put this down for a second.

119
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,380
Oh, my God.

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,900
- What?  - I don't think this is gonna fit.

121
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,380
You'll have to get a smaller mirror.

122
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,860
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

123
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,600
Haley, you'll still be the same size in it.

124
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,750
No!

125
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,280
Oh, my God! We're trapped!

126
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,020
Well, it -- it's -- it's not such a huge disaster.

127
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,510
You know, you'll just be a little late for school.

128
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,010
Make up your mind! Which is it?!

129
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,430
Oh, my god. I'm missing a text.

130
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,910
Just got real, didn't it?

131
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,420
Who sent you?!

132
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,560
Come on. We have to go. We can't be late.

133
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,750
I am so excited. Aren't you?

134
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,570
- Oh, no. - What? What's happening?

135
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,690
How are you ruining this?

136
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,260
There's a report of lice in Lily's class.

137
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,350
Ugh. It's probably from Portia.

138
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,970
You know, she is always so filthy.

139
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,380
They had to kick her out of swim buddies

140
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,530
because she left a ring around the pool.

141
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,040
We should probably cancel our meeting

142
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,110
and pick Lily up ourselves, huh?

143
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,570
Probably? We have to!

144
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,840
We can't risk infecting Claire

145
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,910
just so we can keep a meeting

146
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,860
with the top wedding photographer in the state.

147
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,210
No. No.

148
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,450
I am calling her.

149
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,270
Yeah, it's the right thing to do...

150
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,710
...even though it's like a 1% chance

151
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,030
of her actually catching anything

152
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,330
and a 100% chance of us freaking her out.

153
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,150
Well, now, wait.

154
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,340
Are we being selfish here, Cam?

155
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,600
Maybe. Go on.

156
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,270
Well, if-- if we alarm her just so

157
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,730
that we can have a clear conscience,

158
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,260
doesn't that make us...

159
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,870
- Monsters.   - ...monsters.

160
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,240
Wouldn't we be doing her a favor

161
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,720
by not telling her and sparing her all that worry?

162
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,950
Second huge favor of the day,

163
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,870
after you got her a meeting with your client.

164
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,280
Mm. I'm -- I'm starting to feel bad about this.

165
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,600
What, because we're doing so many favors,

166
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,540
Claire will never be able to pay us back?

167
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,430
Thank you.

168
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,040
Nope, she does not need the stress, Cam.

169
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,120
Yep. That's it. No more favors for Claire.

170
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,190
No!

171
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,230
Look at us!

172
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,700
Two blondes, having fun!

173
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,950
Hey, buddy!

174
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,980
My match is coming up.

175
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,380
Got any final dad-vice?

176
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,030
Starting to sound natural, right?

177
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,040
You know what? Just get out there and enjoy yourself.

178
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,370
You showed real character trying a new sport.

179
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,930
No matter what happens, I couldn't be prouder.

180
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,800
Thanks, dad.

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,970
You bet. Go get 'em!

182
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,710
That may be the best part about being a parent.

183
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,420
Whatever's going on in your personal life,

184
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,150
when your kid's happy, you're happy.

185
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,350
A happy kid is like an antidepressant,

186
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,440
but a natural one,

187
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,620
not the kind your husband has to find

188
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,420
in your jewelry drawer.

189
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,440
Enough said about that!

190
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,620
Hey, Gil.

191
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, whoops! I'm sorry, man.

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,220
I hope I didn't blind ya.

193
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,690
Although you might not want to see what's next.

194
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,600
Our kids are wrestling each other.

195
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,060
- Are you kidding?   - Nope!

196
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,980
There's my little bra-snapper right there.

197
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,020
He's a beast, man.

198
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,100
No, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

199
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,620
No, I get it.

200
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,280
This is when you try to intimidate me.

201
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,250
No! No. Hey, good luck.

202
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,010
Hey, did you ever hear about those

203
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,580
illegal baby-fighting rings they got in the border?

204
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,620
That's not a real thing.

205
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,410
Yeah, wife and I brought him down there.

206
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,710
Won a whole carload of chickens.

207
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,290
See you out there, man.

208
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,510
That never happened!

209
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,240
Watch yourself! Watch yourself!

210
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,340
Wish me luck.

211
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,380
No need. You worked hard.

212
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,570
I just want you to have fun.

213
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,350
Thanks, dad.

214
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,280
Also, I'd like to revise

215
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,120
what I said to you in the car about biting.

216
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,420
Manny, they have everything here--

217
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,390
the rainforest experience, the hurricane booth,

218
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,000
discovering the body --

219
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,860
We have that one in Colombia, too, but --

220
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,300
but a different kind.

221
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,480
- Oh, no.  - What?

222
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,580
You don't hear that?

223
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,740
It's my new shoes. They're squeaking.

224
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,220
Then walk softer.

225
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,370
Oh, great.

226
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,110
It sounds like the floor's made of cat toys.

227
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,690
- I'm screwed!  - Why?

228
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:42,340
Why? Because these kids make fun of everything.

229
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,730
Hand them this, it'll stick with me forever.

230
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,480
That's what happened to mumbles.

231
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,580
Hey, Manny, come with us.

232
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,060
Let's go, mumbles.

233
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,770
One time!

234
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,610
Let's go.

235
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,530
Just go on without me.

236
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,700
I'm just gonna stand here.

237
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,080
What -- forever?

238
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,790
What happened to him?

239
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,630
He didn't used to be that self-conscious

240
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,050
before high school.

241
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,220
He used to go around in his poncho,

242
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,940
play the pan flute.

243
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,920
Ay, I miss my little old Manny.

244
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,110
Manny, you care too much about what other people think!

245
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,980
I know that some of the mothers here

246
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,800
want to make fun of me

247
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,480
because of my accent and my bouncy bosom.

248
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,770
But they don't. You know why?

249
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,890
Because I don't care. Because I walk with confidence.

250
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,580
And so can you. Let's go.

251
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,590
This place sucks so bad.

252
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,780
Sure does, giggles.

253
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,950
One time!

254
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,230
Okay, she's not leaving.

255
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,390
You got to lure her away from the staircase.

256
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,080
She'll trust you.

257
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,570
You're kind of dressed like an animal trainer.

258
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,700
Why do you keep calling it a "She"?

259
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,180
Well, because "He"s don't look at me like that.

260
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,800
My god, is she gonna sleep all day long?

261
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,300
Okay, that, coming from you?

262
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,700
The possum's actually laughing.

263
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,510
And, besides, I mean, it's obviously not sleeping.

264
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,250
What else would she be doing?

265
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,820
Playing...?

266
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,190
Playing...what?

267
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,150
Oh, my god!

268
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,710
Playing possum, the one thing

269
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,340
that absolutely everyone knows possums do.

270
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,770
Ha, ha! I got you!

271
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,970
I was playing possum on you by pretending --

272
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,900
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Don't even.

273
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,800
No, my god.

274
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,990
Mom's not even here until 5:00.

275
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,760
And you ate our only power bar.

276
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,010
Well, that's probably what attracted it!

277
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,450
You know, we got to throw something at it.

278
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,410
Fine.

279
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,070
Are you crazy?!

280
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,650
Mr. Perlowe will be right with you.

281
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,890
- Thank you. - Thank you.

282
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,670
I was so nervous before, but I think I really got this.

283
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,100
Oh, no!

284
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,190
What? What's happening?

285
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,310
How are you ruining this?

286
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,900
Why does everybody say that?

287
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,030
The -- the director of photography

288
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,790
we met with this morning --he's turning us down.

289
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,820
Why?

290
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,680
"Creative differences."

291
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,380
He suggested one of us wear a hidden camera

292
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,120
in our boutonniere.

293
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,650
He called it "Groom with a view."

294
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,200
Somebody got it into his head to call it the "Cam-cam."

295
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,490
Then there was a lot of foot-stomping

296
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,540
and cane-snapping and monocle-smashing.

297
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,420
Who is your wedding photographer -- Mr. Peanut?

298
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,850
It's a director of --

299
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,080
- It's a wedding. - Sorry I'm late.

300
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,980
Jim Perlowe,

301
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,810
this is my sister, Claire Dunphy.

302
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,080
Hi. A pleasure to meet you.

303
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,980
Listen, I went by the construction site this morning,

304
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,660
and those condos are gonna be fantastic --

305
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,870
Assuming, of course, you get the right closets and blinds.

306
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,330
Of cour-- appears the meeting has already started, so, okay!

307
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,120
Yes, it has! Bye-bye, Mitchell!

308
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,980
- Shall we?  - Yes, absolutely! So...

309
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,510
Hey, sleepy!

310
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,390
Long nap today.

311
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,850
Claire must've really worn you out at the park, huh?

312
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:20,520
Yeah.

313
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,920
Do you want to lie down with me, daddy?

314
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,360
Oh, honey, the day I answer no to that question...

315
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,490
...is today.

316
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,990
Where are you going?

317
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,180
I got to call daddy.

318
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,780
You should know that it's not just our low prices

319
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,920
that set us apart.

320
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,080
It's our level of experience.

321
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,670
You know,I have seen it before

322
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,360
a new guy walks into an irregular-shaped space,

323
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,270
and he's just like, "Ugh! Where do we even start?"

324
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,480
You start with measurements, maybe.

325
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,440
Hey, Cam, what's up?

326
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,260
Well, it's official. Someone has lice.

327
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,510
Daddy, hug me!

328
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,920
I would, but remember, the carpet's hot lava!

329
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,410
Yeah, hot lava!

330
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,680
Oh, my god. Are you sure?

331
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,330
I think so.

332
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,390
Her head sounds like pop rocks.

333
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,140
You have to warn Claire.

334
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,170
Daddy, this game is mean.

335
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,670
Well, you know what, sweetie?

336
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,000
All right. No. J-just stay calm.

337
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,870
First of all, if there's anything that you need from me,

338
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,580
anything at all,

339
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,930
I will be living at the embassy suites.

340
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,480
Secondly, there's -- there's no guarantee

341
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,420
that she has it.

342
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,960
I mean, I'm with her right now.

343
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,290
I think I'd know.

344
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,250
Yeah, I think I know.

345
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,380
So, as you can see, all of them are modules,

346
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,350
So they can be customized for each unit -- Mitchell!

347
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,190
Hey! Hi!

348
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,390
So, claire, I need to talk to you.

349
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,630
Yeah, right -- right when we're done.

350
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,570
Just after the meeting.

351
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,580
- We got pine, cedar...   - It's kind of important.

352
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,320
A-actually, I got to take this call.

353
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,600
- Excuse me.  - Okay.

354
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,160
What is going on with you?

355
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,880
Okay, so, you know how you've been scratching your head?

356
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,170
Oh, god. Is it that noticeable?

357
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,780
I-I have some kind of nervous tic.

358
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,530
Yeah, there might be one of those in there, too.

359
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,240
Um, so, lily brought home lice from school.

360
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,280
What?

361
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,810
Yeah, and, actually, I would've told you,

362
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,210
but Cam thought that maybe --

363
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,210
You let me walk around

364
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,930
with insects gnawing on my skull,

365
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,090
and you said nothing?

366
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,970
Yeah, but, Claire --

367
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,940
Come here, little rusty.

368
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,640
No, listen, you --

369
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,370
What kind of monster puts their self-interest

370
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,270
ahead of telling another human being

371
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,430
that they are going to get a parasite infestation?

372
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,720
I feel you would've done the same thing.

373
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,340
- Never.   - No, Claire, stop it!

374
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,500
Uh, I got to get off to another meeting.

375
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,300
But, Claire, let's just cut to the chase.

376
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,210
You got my business.

377
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,560
Oh, super!

378
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,480
Oh, I think we're way past handshakes, huh?

379
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,650
Manny, stop disrespecting your ancestors.

380
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,670
It took them 6 1/2 million years to walk upright!

381
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,240
Didn't you hear the tour guy?

382
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:39,640
"Duh."

383
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,060
No, don't give me that attitude.

384
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,280
No, I -- why is your face red?

385
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,250
What?

386
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,190
It must be my allergy medication.

387
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,710
I must be overreacting to it!

388
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,060
Um, I'll get you some water.

389
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,510
There's a fountain right over there.

390
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,290
Manny, where have you been all day?

391
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,480
I was in the bird wing.

392
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,080
Hilarious they call it that, no?

393
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,610
Where's your mom?

394
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,890
She was just there.

395
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,400
I think she's hiding.

396
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,740
She probably saw she and I were wearing the same outfit

397
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,960
and didn't want to get outdone...as usual.

398
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,490
Uh yeah, maybe.

399
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,810
But the important thing

400
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,150
is that I have fun out there, right?

401
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,360
Okay, let's go over this again,

402
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,890
'cause I feel like you're not listening.

403
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,760
I need you to win.

404
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,770
Hey, Jay.

405
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,480
Hey, Luke.

406
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,800
Don't let your dad get in your head.

407
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,490
Get out there and do your best.

408
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,610
All right.

409
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,160
What the hell was that?

410
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,820
He's wrestling Gil Thorpe's kid.

411
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,880
I hate that guy.

412
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,580
Always trying to make me feel like less of a man.

413
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,260
The guy that took your necklace, right?

414
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,160
- My medallion! - Call it what you want.

415
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,020
I'm just glad I don't have to help you with the clasp again.

416
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,740
Jay, are you crying?

417
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,250
No!

418
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,770
Referee sprayed some disinfectant on the mats.

419
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,500
I got some in my eye. You got a tissue?

420
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,570
Here you go.

421
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,710
Keep it.

422
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,760
It's my wife's.

423
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
- Hey, dad! - Hey, son!

424
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,110
Good to see you.

425
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,190
Uh, the match is about to start... yeah?

426
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,800
...which means it's about to finish.

427
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,670
You see that little petunia he's wrestling?

428
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,420
Yes.

429
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,390
You know Gil's dad?

430
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,770
I know he always sees me at my worst.

431
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,280
I really want this win, Phil.

432
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,700
I can taste it, like metal.

433
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,450
Me, too. Metal.

434
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,930
I don't know what it is with this guy,

435
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,910
but no matter what I do,

436
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,310
I just can't win with him.

437
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,720
That's the way I am with his son.

438
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,870
And Time Warner Cable.

439
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,580
It's emasculating, you know?

440
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,510
I mean, it's not a feeling a man should have.

441
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,180
Jay, you know what the beginning of "Love" is?

442
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,470
Oh, for god's sake, we're just talking here.

443
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,870
Why do you always have to make everything

444
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,210
bigger than it is?!

445
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,410
L.O.

446
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,820
Hey, Phil, listen.

447
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,650
Does your pharmacy carry lice shampoo?

448
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,150
Lily got it at school.

449
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,730
Ooh, away, scary robot!

450
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,630
Away!

451
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,980
I can't breathe.

452
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,540
Well, good. Neither can your hair pets.

453
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,840
- What?   - Nothing.

454
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,480
Lily got lice from someone.

455
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,970
- Portia. - Who else?

456
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,450
You know what? Skip the pharmacy.

457
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,870
Just -- just borrow our lice kit.

458
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,730
It's in the basement. The key's under the mat.

459
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,090
Thank you, Phil. Thanks.

460
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,170
All right!

461
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,940
Enough.. with scary robot!

462
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,130
But who wants to pretend to be a dog and ride in the car?

463
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:02,690
I do!

464
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,900
Okay! Meet you at the door!

465
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,660
And remember --

466
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,520
we're gonna keep our head outside the window.

467
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,660
- Fun! - Yeah, fun! Uh-huh!

468
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Fun.

469
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,980
All right, the match is starting.

470
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,170
I feel that metal now in my mouth,

471
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,430
like you were saying.

472
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,360
What if he loses?

473
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,440
Then we hide our disappointment.

474
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,470
Follow my lead. I've been doing it for years.

475
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,520
The kid needs to know we support him no matter what.

476
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,610
- Come on, Luke! - Luke!

477
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,170
All right. They're gone.

478
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,480
Okay. Let's get out of here.

479
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,610
Stay close.

480
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,360
Mom, you're unbelievable.

481
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,970
Ay, that's sweet, but I know I look terrible.

482
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,540
You come down on me for being self-conscious,

483
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,700
then you run and hide because your face is red.

484
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
You're right.

485
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,030
I keep blaming the high-school boys

486
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,510
for making you self-conscious,

487
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,700
and you're taking after me.

488
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,840
We can assign blame when we're safely

489
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,320
behind our tinted windows.

490
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,870
- We're trapped! - No.

491
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,370
When I was in the caveman exhibit,

492
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,890
I discovered fire exits.

493
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,310
I'll explain to you why that's funny in the car.

494
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,950
Follow me.

495
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,700
No, Manny.

496
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,090
It's time for me to set a good example for you.

497
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,060
Okay.

498
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,090
Mom, what are you doing?

499
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,450
I'm gonna show you that it's not important

500
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,700
what other people think.

501
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,430
What is important is that you stay true to yourself.

502
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,850
It was the bravest thing my mom had ever done.

503
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,640
Hey, everybody!

504
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,070
Uh, hear my squeaky shoes?

505
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,370
Pretty funny, isn't it?

506
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,250
That's right, it's me -- ol' squeaky shoes.

507
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,390
Crazy!

508
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,730
Get a load of that pink shirt.

509
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,820
Aww, it's so pretty.

510
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,280
Hey, Manny, nice top.

511
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,440
Uh, but my shoes!

512
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,090
What about 'em, pink top?

513
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,570
It was the bravest thing he has ever done.

514
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,370
They call me "Pink top."

515
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,880
My hero.

516
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,200
Pink top.

517
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Hey! Whoo! Good fight!

518
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,140
We really blew it with Luke today.

519
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,430
How could I do that?

520
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,960
My dad never missed an opportunity to let me know

521
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,090
when I disappointed him, and I do it to my grandkid.

522
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,220
It's just as much my fault.

523
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,760
I've seen what having a disapproving father

524
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,770
has done to my wife.

525
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,090
I should've known better.

526
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,390
Dang it.

527
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,850
Buddy, I know you're upset.

528
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,830
You've got every right.

529
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,800
We made that wrestling match all about our stupid feud.

530
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:22,770
That was wrong.

531
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,050
Forget about those jerks.

532
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,670
We couldn't be anything but proud of you,

533
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,720
just like I'm super proud of your mom.

534
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,680
Let's repair this one first.

535
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,670
We just don't want you to beat yourself up

536
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,850
because you lost.

537
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,850
I'm not.

538
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,230
I just started wrestling.

539
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,220
Sure, it would've been nice to win, but I tried my best.

540
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,680
I just said "Dang it" Because I forgot to get a straw.

541
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,680
Son of a gun! He's actually okay.

542
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,720
I don't buy it.

543
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,710
Why? What are you talking about?

544
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,110
No kid lets down his father and grandfather

545
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,360
and is that okay with it.

546
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,000
He's burying his feelings.

547
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,760
Or maybe he's just raised better than that.

548
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,840
He knows it's pointless to fight other people's battles.

549
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,690
It's all in the DNA, Phil.

550
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,460
My old man has a problem with somebody?

551
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,240
Trust me

552
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,470
I'm looking for that guy's kid on the schoolyard.

553
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,710
It's how men work.

554
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,960
Or used to work.

555
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,450
Maybe those thuggish Pritchett genes

556
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,230
got mixed with more evolved Dunphy genes,

557
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,210
resulting in a more elevated human being.

558
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,780
Oh, my god! He's attacking him!

559
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,480
Hey! Hey! Get off my kid!

560
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,730
Hey. Hey! Get off my kid!

561
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,860
Aah! You get off of my kid!

562
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,950
Hey, hey! Get off my daughter's husband!

563
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,360
Would it kill you to call me your kid, Jay?

564
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,470
Oh, my god. He was saving him.

565
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,740
Oh. Have a good day.

566
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,460
Well...all's well that ends well.

567
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,970
Yeah, yeah. Here we go.

568
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,800
Grab a seat, son.

569
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,630
- Move. - Coming in.

570
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,070
I think, uh, probably just a regular burger.

571
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,480
I can't see it anymore. You think it's gone?

572
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,690
It could be hiding.

573
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,360
I have an idea.

574
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,220
What are you doing?!

575
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm gonna create a distraction

576
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,610
so that we can make a break for it.

577
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,130
Give it a second to warm up.

578
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:47,990
Okay.

579
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,880
It's back!

580
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,530
Oh, my gosh.

581
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,590
It's so dark down here.

582
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,940
Be careful, sweetie.

583
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,560
What is going on down here?!

584
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,310
All right, I got to admit something right here.

585
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,030
You impressed me today, Luke.

586
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,840
That kid started choking.

587
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,920
You didn't see a rival or...

588
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,780
...a chance to fight your family's stupid battles.

589
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,890
You just saw somebody who needed help.

590
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,940
And that makes you the biggest man in this whole car.

591
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,070
You just attacked him, didn't you?

592
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,430
He made that choke sign.

593
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,060
I thought he was mocking my wrestling.

594
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,530
- Let's go ahead and keep that to ourselves. - Yeah.

595
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,410
I'll get it.

596
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,310
Honey, I take back everything I ever said

597
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,000
about this stupid invention.

598
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,160
It has a name

599
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,530
"The real head scratcher, T.M."

600
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,130
Well, come on in.

601
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,150
Just want to say I'm sorry, "Doofy."

602
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,060
And yet you're still call--

603
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,080
What your kid did today was amazing.

604
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,540
No hard feelings, right?

605
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,400
Hey, Cam, hold off on that thing for a second.

606
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,310
Lily, honey?

607
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,870
Are you kidding me? It's all in good fun.

608
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,720
All right. Good.

609
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,200
Whoa! Who's this little dumpling?

610
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,750
Only my niece.

611
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,150
If there's one thing she loves, it's piggy-back.

612
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,100
No, I don't.

613
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,040
Yep! Hop on up there!

614
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,050
All right!

615
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,490
Who's this man?

616
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,420
You can call me uncle Gil!

617
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,380
Uncle Gil!

618
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,850
You two look great together!

619
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,010
Get in there! Yeah!

620
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,430
I'm telling you, these little buggers love me.

621
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,690
That's the plan! Yeah!
