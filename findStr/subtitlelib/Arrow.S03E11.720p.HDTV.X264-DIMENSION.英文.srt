7
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,480
My name is Oliver Queen.

8
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,530
After five years in hell,

9
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,680
I have come home with only one goal--

10
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,520
to save my city.

11
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,560
Now others have joined my crusade.

12
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,820
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

13
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,140
To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.

14
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,370
I am...something else.

15
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,400
Previously, on "Arrow"...

16
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,770
If you want to go out there, I can't stop you.

17
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,080
But I don't have to help you.

18
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,870
Who the hell are you?

19
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,760
I'm the justice you can't run from.

20
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,370
It's Danny Brickwell. His street name's Brick.

21
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,240
You are all part of my crew now.

22
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,030
Together, we are going to take over the Glades.

23
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,730
Oliver.

24
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,630
I asked her to come here...

25
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,870
So she could bring you back to life.

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,370
This is a duel...

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,500
Oliver, with one of the most dangerous men

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,690
that has ever walked the earth.

29
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,970
I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think I could win.

30
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,980
I don't worry that you can beat him.

31
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:14,450
I am terrified you won't kill him.

32
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,640
That's not who you are anymore.

33
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,700
And I'm afraid that Ra's is going

34
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,740
to use your humanity against you.

35
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,900
You're right.

36
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,140
- I'll stay. - Really?

37
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,360
Are you sure?

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,660
I'm sure of one thing--

39
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,130
I love you.

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,060
Oliver.

41
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,120
Drink this.

42
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,570
More herbs?

43
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,970
Penicillin. For the infection.

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
You saved my life.

45
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,950
The snow and cold helped.

46
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,020
And your will to live.

47
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,660
You should be dead.

48
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,470
Did you know Maseo would bring me here?

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,020
He was the one who told me to meet you at this cabin.

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,770
I didn't realize that the...two of you

51
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,550
were still in contact.

52
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,900
We are not.

53
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,970
Maseo...

54
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,770
You're in no condition to stand.

55
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,440
Then help me.

56
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,210
I'm glad you stayed.

57
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,470
Then you'll be disappointed.

58
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,820
When the storm passes,

59
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,410
I'll return to Nanda Parbat.

60
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,600
Maseo...

61
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,680
if Ra's finds out that you saved me,

62
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,710
betrayed him...

63
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,460
he's going to kill you.

64
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,230
Don't waste your breath for worries on me.

65
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,520
Your concern should be for your home,

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
and what has become of it in your absence.

67
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,230
Help!

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,680
You picked the wrong alley.

69
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,850
See, this one cuts off here at Carlisle.

70
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,380
You pick the next one,

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,640
and you're free and clear to Reimer Avenue.

72
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,770
Now, you want to do this the hard way...

73
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,590
or the harder way?

74
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,900
Run.

75
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,040
I heard rumors about a mask who protects girls around here.

76
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,720
I guess you ain't her.

77
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,200
This is Brick's town now.

78
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,170
I think we should talk.

79
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,060
This is going to hurt a little.

80
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,800
Just one more.

81
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,190
Sorry, I warned you it was going to hurt.

82
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,150
You said a little.

83
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,520
Yeah, well. Dig taught us how to suture.

84
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,570
I guess Felicity got the hang of it quicker than I did.

85
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,460
- Where is Felicity? - Let's talk about you.

86
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,040
What the hell do you think you were doing out there?

87
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,570
Same thing as you.

88
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,010
I've had training from Oliver

89
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,500
and years on the streets.

90
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,470
You have a law degree.

91
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,450
Look...

92
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,890
I get it.

93
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,600
This?

94
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,030
This isn't how you deal with grief, Laurel.

95
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,750
This is how you get yourself killed.

96
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,550
Laurel, what the hell?

97
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm fine.

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,590
You are certifiable if you think

99
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,240
you can wear your sister's mask.

100
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,620
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

101
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,920
But Oliver, the Arrow...

102
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,840
He's gone now.

103
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,360
And like it or not, the Canary sends the same message.

104
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,580
- They fear her. - No, Laurel.

105
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,160
They fear your sister.

106
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,310
Yeah.

107
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,430
She's not here anymore.

109
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,030
What are you doing here so early?

110
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,680
The meeting's not for another three hours.

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,110
Yeah, well, I convinced Mayor Castle

112
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,700
it might be a good idea to move it up.

113
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,980
What, with a murderous killer running amuck in the city.

114
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,850
Isn't that what the police are for?

115
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,390
Well, she wanted to speak to city leaders.

116
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,680
And I'll help in whatever way I can.

117
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,550
And by help, you mean money and counsel,

118
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,610
not a suit powered by...

119
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,340
Dwarf star alloy that fires lasers at people?

120
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,830
Well, they aren't lasers. That would be ridiculous.

121
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,850
They're compressed hard light beams.

122
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,060
And they don't actually fire, because I can't

123
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,700
get anyone, specifically you,

124
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,270
to help me fix the nanite chip.

125
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,650
Well, I already told you, Ray, I am not interested

126
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,140
in helping you with your suicide mission.

127
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,500
There is nothing that you can say

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,550
or do that is going to change my mind.

129
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,800
Are you ready to go?

130
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,750
Hey. What are you doing here?

131
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,790
Oh, with that Brick guy running around the Glades,

132
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,630
I figured I shouldn't leave my gear any place he might find it.

133
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,810
What are you doing here?

134
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,030
This neighborhood isn't exactly

135
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,750
a safe place to be hanging out right now.

136
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,360
Well, I'm not hanging out, I'm just doing my job.

137
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,950
Are we cool? It just seems like

138
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,460
you've been avoiding me, you know,

139
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,150
ever since we had that moment.

140
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,350
Moment? You have a very high opinion on your kissing skills.

141
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,800
Judging from how you responded,

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,020
I think you've got a pretty high opinion of them, too.

143
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,570
Unless you need a reminder.

144
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,300
No, not right now.

145
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,440
But, I'll see you later?

146
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,330
- What are you doing here? - I went by your apartment

147
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,650
to see how your packing is going,

148
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,490
only to discover that it's not.

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,400
I can't leave.

150
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,630
Not without knowing where Oliver is.

151
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,720
I thought it made it clear that leaving was not optional.

152
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,990
No, actually, you didn't make anything clear.

153
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,580
You just ordered me to uproot my life

154
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,460
and didn't even give me a reason why.

155
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,360
All you need to know is that we're in danger,

156
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,520
and every day we remain in Starling,

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,830
the danger grows greater. Now get in the car, Thea.

158
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,960
No.

159
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,470
Not until you tell me the truth.

160
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,030
You're not ready for the truth.

161
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,110
Then I guess I'm not ready to leave Starling City.

162
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,260
Yeah, I know, yeah. OK, I'm on it.

163
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,720
- I’m sorry I'm late. - You're not late.

164
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,660
Castle's still hashing things out with her people.

165
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,230
You heard from your sister?

166
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,090
No. Why?

167
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,680
Well, she's, back in town.

168
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,150
A girl came into the precinct a few hours ago.

169
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,290
Claimed a blonde in a mask

170
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,300
and a black leather jacket saved her life.

171
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,810
All right, thank you, everyone,

172
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,380
for coming, please take your seats.

173
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,880
As you know, over the last week,

174
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,470
a criminal organization headed by Danny Brickwell

175
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,430
has been on a crime spree unlike anything since Al Capone.

176
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,030
Which begs the question-- why aren't you arresting him?

177
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,510
We sent in an ESU team to do just that.

178
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,660
Most of those men are in the hospital now.

179
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,270
Now we got no clue where he's holed up.

180
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,650
Maybe if we had more men,

181
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,060
but that means more money.

182
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,250
I've got a few bucks.

183
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,130
Sorry. In fact, Palmer Technology

184
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,910
has just made a large donation to the SCPD,

185
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,770
but it'll take time for that personal equipment to do any good.

186
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,310
We need to consider calling in the National Guard.

187
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,130
Always wanted to meet the mayor.

188
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,760
Bring the mayor and the aldermen.

189
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,800
Kill the rest.

190
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,220
Laurel!

191
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,110
See? That's why I need a technosuit.

192
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,770
Is Mayor Castle secure?

193
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,210
Yeah.

194
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,740
But what about the aldermen?

195
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,790
Brick's got them.

196
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,420
Your penicillin tea tastes like penicillin.

197
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,190
We can't let him go back to the League.

198
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,150
It's not our choice.

199
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,450
Maybe we could have changed Maseo's mind,

200
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,700
but not his.

201
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,200
Not Sarab's.

202
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,290
Sarab is just a name that Ra's Al Ghul calls him.

203
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,430
He's still your husband.

204
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,250
Thank you.

205
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,250
Maseo blames himself for what happened.

206
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,830
Yeah. It wasn't his fault.

207
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,000
The line between grief and guilt

208
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,560
is a thin one.

209
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,090
Sometimes, death is preferable to the agony of life.

211
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,770
Tracker's in there.

212
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,800
Looks like a VIP area.

213
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,780
Probably where they're holding Tatsu.

214
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,800
There's a lot of muscle in front of that door.

215
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,950
This club is a Triad front.

216
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,650
It will be heavily guarded.

217
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,520
But will you do anything to get her back?

218
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,990
Yes, I would.

219
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,410
I told you it would be heavily guarded.

220
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,030
You're late.

221
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,090
- That's funny. - I wasn't talking to you.

222
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,620
Was addressing your partner.

223
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,350
What?

224
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,510
Did you bring the item?

225
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,850
What is she talking about?!

226
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,860
I want to see my wife.

227
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,230
I said I want to see my wife.

228
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,130
Once I know she's alive,

229
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,020
then you can have the Alpha.

230
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,200
Sorry, Oliver.

231
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,630
Maseo!

232
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,360
What are you doing?

234
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,160
How's your heart?

235
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,310
Still beating. You OK?

236
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,890
Listen, I couldn't help but notice that nobody in a green hood

237
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,260
showed up to save the day.

238
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,620
That's because he's gone.

239
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,720
What do you mean, gone?

240
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,140
It means we're on our own.

241
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,520
But that doesn't make sense, what,

242
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,610
the Arrow's gone, but Sara's back?

243
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,350
Wait, Sara's back?

244
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,270
What are you talking about?

245
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,080
Yeah, she's been taking out Brick's men solo.

246
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,490
I've been getting reports down at the precinct.

247
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,460
Blonde, mask, bo-staff. You didn't know?

248
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,660
I've sort of been living under a rock these days.

249
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,140
Ask him to give me a call.

250
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,970
Yeah.

251
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,470
Will do.

252
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,730
Jim huffman.

253
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,220
34, eight arrests,

254
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,580
no convictions.

255
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,550
Grand theft auto, B&E, drugs.

256
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,570
You did pretty well flying solo.

257
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,320
What made you decide to start working for Brick?

258
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,170
I'm not telling you anything.

259
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,720
Are you sure about that? I still have another heel.

260
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,590
Kidding.

261
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,520
You don't want to talk about Brick, that's fine.

262
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,380
Then let's talk about something else.

263
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,200
Why would you murder Julio Salazar?

264
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,700
Salazar?

265
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,520
Head of Los Halcones?

266
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,050
I had nothing to do with him getting popped.

267
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,730
Well, that's not what your file says.

268
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,740
See?

269
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,500
What kind of game is this?

270
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,990
You just wrote that down!

271
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,130
You're making this stuff up!

272
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,260
Actually, I can charge you with whatever crime that I want.

273
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,850
Of course, then they'd have to keep you in custody

274
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,200
until the trial.

275
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,470
Good news--

276
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,500
Belle Reve, it's a lot more comfortable than Iron Heights.

277
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,490
Belle Reve's where the Los Halcones are locked up.

278
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,020
They think I offed Salazar.

279
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,670
I won't last two seconds in there!

280
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,760
Tell me where I can find Danny Brickwell

281
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,580
and you won't have to.

282
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,100
They'll kill me.

283
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,700
Charges filed by Dinah Laurel Lance, Assistant District Att--

284
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,180
Hey, stop. Stop!

285
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,480
I'll tell you where you can find Brick.

286
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,250
If you're looking for Thea,

287
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,790
she's not here.

288
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,100
I know. I came to see you.

289
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,680
Following me, Mr. Harper?

290
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,050
You need to stay away from her.

291
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,670
I don't know why you want her to leave Starling City,

292
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,520
but I'm not letting her go anywhere with you.

293
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,530
Well, thank you for that.

294
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,290
I was in need of some humor.

295
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,610
I wasn't joking.

296
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:45,710
You are poison.

297
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,940
You put her in Ra's Al Ghul's gunsights.

298
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,500
You had her kill Sara.

299
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,870
Thea knows nothing about Sara.

300
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,300
And she never will.

301
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,740
That's where you're wrong.

302
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,030
I know her.

303
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:04,100
She'll get to the truth no matter how well you think you're hiding it.

304
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,210
And when she does find out that you've been lying to her,

305
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,520
you're going to lose her forever.

306
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,670
Trust me; I know from experience.

307
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,540
This is a family matter, Mr. Harper.

308
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,070
And you are not family.

309
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,120
- Sit. - Ok.

310
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,550
Are you OK?

311
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,270
Yeah, I'm fine.

312
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,320
Armed gunmen attacking you.

313
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,930
That had to have brought back a few bad memories.

314
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,250
Yeah.

315
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,480
When it started,

316
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,500
all I could think about was the night Anna died.

317
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,660
But when that gunman charged us,

318
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,450
all I could think about was

319
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,010
saving you.

320
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,550
You were right.

321
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,500
I've been going about this all wrong.

322
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,840
When I started the atom project,

323
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,680
it was all about avenging Anna.

324
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,190
But what it has become about

325
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,570
is... protecting the people I care for.

326
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,950
You mean the city?

327
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,290
No.

328
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,390
I mean you.

329
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,060
You sure you still want to use that thing?

330
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,460
We have plenty of other weapons here.

331
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,230
- It was Sara's. - Roy!

332
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,640
I thought we were on the same page with this.

333
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,430
That was before Brick kidnapped three aldermen.

334
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,130
Laurel said she knows where they are.

335
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,370
We put their location through Felicity's surveillance program

336
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,840
but Brick keeps moving them.

337
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,740
We can still track them,

338
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,540
take them out en route, but the window's closing.

339
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,240
Fine. Laurel, monitor us from here.

340
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,690
- Talk me and Roy in. - No.

341
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,990
That's not how this is going to work.

342
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,840
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

343
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,610
Laurel, you're not your sister!

344
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,130
You think I don't know that?

345
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,050
You lost a brother. If there's anyone

346
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,870
who I thought would understand, it would be you.

347
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,110
Stay close to her.

348
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,510
We should have got the Mayor. That was a loss.

349
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,730
Let's go.

350
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,310
Laurel... Laurel, Laurel, watch your six!

351
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,810
Lucky for you, I don't like hitting women.

352
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,420
Go, go, go!

353
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,420
Bad choice!

354
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,960
This one's on you.

357
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,440
Danny Brickwell is still at large tonight

358
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:50,210
after abducting three aldermen from City Hall

359
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,610
earlier this evening.

360
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,530
Though he's managed to evade SCPD thus far--

361
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,940
- Dad. - Cell phone video shows two vigilantes...

362
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,050
- Hey. You OK? - Yeah.

363
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,790
associated with the Arrow,

364
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,740
the Red Arrow and the woman in black, in pursuit.

365
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,200
Reports now trickling in suggest a confrontation...

366
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,690
Your sister did her best.

367
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,130
Channel 52's running cell phone footage of her

368
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,670
and the Arrow's partner, the guy in the red hood.

369
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,980
Did Sara talk to you?

370
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,740
What? No.

371
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,810
She hasn't, not yet.

372
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,730
You know, she must know we're seeing this stuff.

373
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,860
Madame Mayor, there's a call for you on line one.

374
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,040
- Take a message. - It's Danny Brickwell.

375
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,230
Mr. Brickwell.

376
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,350
How is your evening going, Madame Mayor?

377
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,280
Mine's not going too well.

378
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,340
Because your city's "Vigilante problem"

379
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,450
became mine earlier tonight. And it's forced my hand--

380
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,410
Look, if you have demands to make, just get on with it.

381
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,470
No demands, just Shakespeare.

382
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,030
"Julius Caesar,"

383
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,730
Act Five, Scene Two.

384
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,740
"They stand and would have parley."

385
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,780
The war stops and together they converse.

386
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,710
I would have parley with you.

387
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,240
That isn't what we're doing right now.

388
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,170
In person, Brockton Point, one hour.

389
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,000
I don't negotiate with terrorists.

390
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,030
And I certainly don't do it in person.

391
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,760
You are already going to one funeral, Madame Mayor.

392
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,980
If you want to make it a hat trick,

393
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,690
well, that's your prerogative.

394
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,280
Me? I'll be at Brockton Point.

395
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,160
If you came to see how packing is going,

396
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,720
it's not.

397
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,810
No.

398
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,810
I came to apologize.

399
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,680
I don't want to lose you, Thea.

400
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,010
But at the same time,

401
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,540
sharing the truth with you is sometimes difficult for me.

402
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,000
Well, maybe you'll get better with practice.

403
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,330
Who are we running from?

404
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,690
His name is Ra's al Ghul.

405
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,520
And why does he want to kill you?

406
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,150
Ra's has a particular code of honor

407
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,850
he feels I've violated.

408
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,910
And he's marked me and my family for death.

409
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,270
I fell in with Ra's because I was consumed by the death of my wife.

410
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,270
And I was marked for death because of the undertaking

411
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,990
that killed my son.

412
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,480
You're all I have left, Thea.

413
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,140
Keeping you safe is all that matters.

414
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,010
Please let me.

415
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,220
Alderman Richard Ford was in his second term at city hall.

416
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,870
He leaves behind a wife and two children.

417
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,300
The city asks the family's privacy

418
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,510
be respected during this trying time.

420
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,810
No official statement...

421
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,770
Laurel...

422
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,880
I'm sorry. I can come back.

423
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,600
No, it's ok. Is...

424
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,740
Is everything ok?

425
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,830
I came to ask you the same thing...

426
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,500
Canary.

427
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,800
I guess you came here to talk some sense into me.

428
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,240
Seems like you could use some.

429
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,250
Not sure you're going to have to bother.

430
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,000
Brick, he...

431
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,730
he killed someone tonight.

432
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,010
In front of me.

433
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,180
I thought that being--

434
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,860
being Sara would make it hurt less.

435
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,760
But instead, it just...

436
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,740
it caused more pain.

437
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,960
Not just for me.

438
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,180
So you don't have to worry.

439
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,880
I'm not going to be putting on that mask again.

440
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm not strong enough to fight for Sara.

441
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,100
Maybe you're not supposed to.

442
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,870
Maybe it's not about Sara,

443
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,680
or Oliver, or anyone else that we care about, who we lost.

444
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,690
Maybe what we've been doing...

445
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:38,480
we've been doing it because there are people we care about

446
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:41,400
that are still... alive.

447
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,460
Maybe we're doing it for them.

448
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,890
I thought you quit.

449
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,990
He's confident.

450
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,560
Meeting out here in the open

451
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,630
where any police sniper could take him out.

452
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,600
Yeah, well, that's 'cause he's got men

453
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,820
that could take the hostages out, check mate.

454
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,970
Madame Mayor.

455
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,010
All this for me?

456
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,050
I'm impressed.

457
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,000
What are you doing here, Palmer?

458
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,150
Just want to make yourself look important?

459
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,400
Good luck with that.

460
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,990
Star City.

461
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,560
Seems more like Brick City to me.

462
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,910
Night is young.

463
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,690
Tough talk.

464
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,950
Too bad all you got is money to back it up.

465
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,900
But you can't fix this with money, Palmer.

466
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,460
I don't know. I got a lot of money.

467
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,510
Say what you came here to say.

468
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,340
We can all end this farce.

469
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,430
Ok.

470
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,530
I've still got two of your men.

471
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,630
If you want them back, it's simple.

472
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,310
Get out of the Glades.

473
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,640
The city servicemen, especially the police--

474
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,910
evacuate.

475
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,150
You're out of your mind!

476
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,160
And you've got until midnight tomorrow.

477
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,660
If I even see a hint of a blue,

478
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,160
your city yes-men, they will be buried.

479
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,510
We won't abandon an entire district.

480
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,390
They did in L.A. In '92, didn't they?

481
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,270
Besides, you don't want every news station

482
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,960
in the country showing graphic footage

483
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,570
of the murders of the aldermen, do you?

484
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,100
You have 23 hours, 59 minutes.

485
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,580
I suggest you move your sweet ass!

487
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,290
Brick wants every cop out of the Glades

488
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,720
or he's going to kill his hostages.

489
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,400
We need help, we need it now.

490
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:46,020
Look, I know you said the Arrow is gone.

491
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,510
Are you sure about that?

492
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,130
Yes, I am.

493
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,130
But I think I know where to find the Canary.

494
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,390
The storm has passed.

495
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,760
Maseo...

496
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,470
You don't have to leave.

497
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,960
You can still have a life.

498
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,720
Why do you assume I want one?

499
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,360
Because I know you and this isn't who you are.

500
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,680
I love you.

501
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,710
No matter who you think you've become.

502
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,870
Maseo?

503
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,770
They found you.

504
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,000
Sarab. What are you doing here?

505
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,400
Ra's al Ghul wants Oliver Queen's remains.

506
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,340
I found no body, only tracks.

507
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,130
Which led here.

508
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,050
Queen is still alive.

509
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,370
But there is no one here.

510
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,390
I was just about to go.

511
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,110
Brothers...

512
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,430
we should go.

513
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,470
Traitor!

514
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,280
She's the mother of my son. You do not get to judge me.

515
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,350
Too late.

516
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,270
This concludes our business.

517
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,610
Only... if the serum is genuine.

518
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,950
It's genuine.

519
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,350
Then you should have no problem with me testing it.

520
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,060
It's a fake. Kill them all.

521
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,740
Go, go, go!

522
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,860
That alderman died because of the decision that I made.

523
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
and there was no Mirakuru to blame this time.

524
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,810
Don't take that on yourself, man.

525
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,410
That was Brick.

526
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,050
What's that?

527
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,580
Sometimes, me and Oliver will come down here after,

528
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,480
you know, tough nights.

529
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,090
He would pour this,

530
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,550
look up and say...

531
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,230
"Prochnost."

532
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,720
What does that mean?

533
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,640
I have no earthly idea.

534
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,210
To Oliver.

535
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,070
To Oliver.

536
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,000
We can't do this without Oliver, can we?

537
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,730
Felicity was right.

538
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,360
Actually, I was wrong,

539
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,010
and I'm not wrong a lot.

541
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,780
He said the mayor is going to cave

542
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,990
and cede control over the Glades.

543
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,410
They're going to evacuate the police force.

544
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,810
So it's up to us to stop Brick.

545
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,270
"Us?" What, are you and Laurel a team now?

546
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,880
I was wrong when I said Oliver's mission was over,

547
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,170
because it's not

548
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,880
just Oliver's mission anymore, it is ours.

549
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,690
It's our home that is under attack.

550
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,990
For all we know, Oliver could be dead

551
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,610
and Sara certainly is.

552
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,720
But there are people that are still alive.

553
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,490
People who need us.

554
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,110
OK.

555
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,300
First we have to find out where those aldermen are.

556
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,820
- It's a bad idea. - So you've said...

557
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:24,260
repeatedly. But it's my decision,

558
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,420
so do as I tell you and give the order!

559
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,980
You give it. You want to pull my men out the Glades,

560
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,850
fine, that's your funeral. But I don't want any part of it.

561
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,600
Excuse me.

562
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,700
Hello?

563
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,900
Hi, Daddy.

564
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,960
Sara.

565
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,730
Sara, where you been?

566
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,190
I've been worried sick about you.

567
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,810
I'm sorry.

568
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,610
I'm here.

569
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,960
Are you OK?

570
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,650
Well, yeah, I mean, I've been better.

571
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,080
I'm sure you have been, too.

572
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,100
Listen, why didn't you call me sooner, honey?

573
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,810
It's complicated.

574
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,190
How is she doing this?

575
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,050
I fed recordings of Sara's voice

576
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,880
through a symbolic algorithm.

577
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,810
Daddy, I'm sorry that I've been away,

578
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,150
but I don't want you to worry about me.

579
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,330
I'm fine.

580
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,940
And I'm here to help.

581
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,730
OK.

582
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,560
What do you need from me?

583
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,460
I need you to tell me everything you know about the hostages.

584
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,920
No matter how seemingly insignificant.

585
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,270
Well, I don't know how knowing their favorite color's

586
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,480
going to help find them, honey.

587
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,610
There has to be something.

588
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,520
Some sort of intel that you couldn't move on

589
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,860
because of the mayor's orders.

590
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,780
I wish.

591
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,290
The clock's running down on these guys, too.

592
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,990
I just found out one of them's got a heart condition.

593
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,520
If his pacemaker isn't recharged soon,

594
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,860
we're going to lose another alderman.

595
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,400
Daddy, that actually helps.

596
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,170
But, I have to go now.

597
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,010
Wait, just listen to me. Be careful out there, OK?

598
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,160
Because I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you.

599
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:40,850
I'll be careful.

600
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,140
I love you, sweetheart.

601
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,500
I love you, too, daddy.

602
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,660
One of the aldermen has a pacemaker.

603
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,330
If it's remote programmable...

604
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,670
It'll have a GPS.

605
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,360
It's going to take me a few minutes to log on to the pacemaker.

606
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,190
Gear up.

607
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,600
This one breakthrough, is all we need, is one--

608
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,830
Yeah. One second.

609
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,800
Sorry to interrupt.

610
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,610
What's going on?

611
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,530
I need the keys to your helicopter.

612
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,860
How would you even fly it?

613
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:18,760
I got that covered.

614
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,250
Can you please just give me the keys now? I...

615
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,450
promise, promise, I will not crash it.

616
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,130
I've got to be honest,

617
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,630
I'd feel a little more confident

618
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:27,670
in your aeronautic abilities if you knew,

619
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,960
for instance, that helicopters don't actually have keys.

620
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,790
They don't have keys?

621
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,650
No.

622
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,570
Is it on the roof?

623
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,290
Yeah, it's on the roof.

624
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,660
Thank you!

625
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,700
I'm going to hold you to the no crash promise.

626
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,310
You do realize it's been five years since

627
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,800
I've flown one of these things, right?

628
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,410
It's like riding a bicycle, I hope.

629
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,640
Do you have Brick's location?

630
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,050
According to the last signal from the pacemaker,

631
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,970
Brick has the aldermen in a warehouse at 16th and Kent.

632
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,350
Not for long, he doesn't.

633
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,850
We got a chopper outside. Check it out.

634
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,890
Roger that. Checking it now.

635
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,310
I guess we're even now.

636
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,140
Follow the hallway 20 yards.

637
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,010
Turn left.

638
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,250
Aldermen!

639
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,430
Come on! Don't worry!

640
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,960
We're going to get you out of here.

641
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,880
Let's go. Go. Go!

642
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,500
Dig, I'm going to need you to find me a way out of here.

643
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:24,920
Copy that.

644
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,160
I still don't like hitting women.

645
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,450
But I could make an exception for you.

646
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,030
I will keep this city safe.

647
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,740
By killing anyone that doesn't do what you say?

648
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,040
Something like that.

649
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,100
Warmer...

650
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,430
Warmer...

651
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,890
We're not going to let you--

652
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,910
Well, it's-- it's done.

653
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,490
Bodies will not be found.

654
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,050
Ok, Maseo, I get you wanting to go back before,

655
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,320
but that was before.

656
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,270
When Ra's finds out that you betrayed the League...

657
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,410
Maseo!

658
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,300
Why the hell did you do that?!

659
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,060
I didn't. You did.

660
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,770
In a successful attempt to escape.

661
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,080
Or you could just come back to Starling City with me.

666
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,710
Can I talk to you for a minute?

667
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:45,220
If you're going to bluff with a fake virus sample,

668
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,540
let me in on it.

669
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,410
- I wasn't bluffing. - What does that mean?

670
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,600
That-- that the Alpha we stole from the military was a fake?

671
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,430
That Amanda Waller knew I would try something like this.

672
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,160
She must have switched out the vial before I took it.

673
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,420
Maseo! You were willing to risk letting hundreds,

674
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,420
maybe thousands of people die?

675
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:08,610
For my wife...yes.

676
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,350
There's nothing I wouldn't do for my family.

677
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:23,820
Thank you.

678
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,580
You saved my life.

679
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,890
Dad?

680
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,530
Both aldermen are back with their families.

681
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,440
Nice job. For all the good it did.

682
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,580
What does that mean?

683
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,410
Mayor Castle caved.

684
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,110
She's pulling SCPD out of the Glades.

685
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,200
But why? Brick doesn't have the aldermen anymore.

686
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,440
No, but what he does have is the home address

687
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,050
of every city council member and their family,

688
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,260
and the means to hurt them.

689
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,760
Played that card 15 minutes ago.

690
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,470
Hey, sweetie, sweetheart, hey,

691
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,470
how about we, uh, cry over each other's shoulders?

692
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,860
Over dinner, at the Chinese place you love.

693
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,810
I can't. I'm sorry.

694
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,280
What's going on with you, sweetheart?

695
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,530
Why are you trying to avoid me?

696
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,610
I'll explain everything.

697
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,160
Just... not tonight.

698
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,040
You ok?

699
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,290
I'm fine, daddy. I'm fine.

700
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,210
Are you ready to leave?

701
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,210
No.

702
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,530
I'm not leaving.

703
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,490
Is this supposed to make up for me missing your adolescence,

704
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,650
this routine of listening and then disobeying me?

705
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,190
Just hear me out.

706
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,460
You told me that we were in danger.

707
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,160
You even told me who was after us.

708
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,750
But what you didn't tell me is why.

709
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,290
Yes, I did.

710
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,690
Because Ra's al Ghul wants us dead.

711
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,920
That's pretty much the case anywhere we go.

712
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,750
So why run?

713
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,690
Why not stay and fight?

714
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,980
Seven months ago, I asked you to teach me.

715
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,910
To teach me how to not be afraid and how to not get hurt.

716
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:44,250
So why are you asking me to be afraid now?

717
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,100
I am not asking you. I am telling you.

718
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,800
You should be very afraid.

719
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,120
Well, I'm not. 'Cause my father taught me not to be.

720
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,920
You taught me how to stand my ground

721
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,880
and how to not give an inch in a battle.

722
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,850
I'm not afraid of this man and you shouldn't be, either.

723
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,910
He should be afraid of us.

724
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,940
Then we'll stay.

725
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,940
Your helicopter

726
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,790
is back on the roof.

727
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,120
I didn't crash it.

728
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,090
Turns out...

729
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,860
It actually had keys.

730
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,310
And this.

731
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,630
The reason you couldn't get the Nanite chip to function

732
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,280
is because what you actually need...

733
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,670
is a quantum processor.

734
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:48,020
The design is elegant.

735
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,010
Thought you weren't going to help me on my suicide mission.

736
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,670
Well, that's the thing.

737
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,710
With my help, you might not end up dead.

738
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,470
I thought you knew about this whole neighborhood

739
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,830
turning into a scene from "The Purge."

740
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,200
We didn't even open tonight.

741
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,380
I forgot my music files here and I've got another gig.

742
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,920
Cheating on me with another club manager.

743
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,240
Well, I heard a rumor you were leaving town.

744
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,320
Happy to say that those rumors are false.

745
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:26,070
That's good news. For both of us.

746
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,130
Don't get so ahead of yourself.

747
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,800
My hard drive's up there.

748
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,080
Take your time.
