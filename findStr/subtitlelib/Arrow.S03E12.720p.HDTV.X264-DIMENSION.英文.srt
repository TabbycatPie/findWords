7
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,130
My name is Oliver Queen.

8
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,040
After 5 years in hell,

9
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,290
I have come home with only one goal,

10
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,620
to save my city.

11
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,150
Now others have joined my crusade.

12
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,430
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

13
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,760
To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else,

14
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,960
I am something else.

15
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,810
Previously on "Arrow"...

16
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:28,870
Don't waste your breath.

17
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,560
Your concern should be for your home

18
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,500
and what has become of it in your absence.

19
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,590
Together, we are gonna take over the Glades.

20
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,790
All city servicemen, especially the police, evacuate.

21
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,790
We won't abandon an entire district.

22
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,600
If I even see a hint of a blue,

23
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,920
your city yes men, they will be buried.

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,930
The mayor's gonna cave

25
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,030
and cede control of the Glades.

26
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,450
So it's up to us to stop Brick.

27
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,440
It's not just Oliver's mission anymore.

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,580
It is ours.

29
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,340
Are you trying to kill yourself?

30
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,370
I have to get back.

31
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,860
You have to rest.

32
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,890
I suppose you planned to leave without telling me.

33
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,750
Well, I knew that you wouldn't approve.

34
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,390
You saved my life.

35
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,850
Thank you.

36
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,380
Maseo saved it.

37
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,490
I merely treated you,

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,510
and you are going to undo all that work

39
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,180
if you try to leave now.

40
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,170
I can't stay here any longer.

41
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,640
My sister, my city.

42
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,220
Will mourn your passing I'm sure.

43
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,830
If you are so concerned,

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,980
just come with me.

45
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,750
You can make sure that I drink my penicillin tea.

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,200
Like Maseo, I've disappeared from the world.

47
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,750
I have no desire to return.

48
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,210
Oh. Tatsu.

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,640
Be well, Oliver.

51
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,360
The Glades have been without police presence for a week now.

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,540
Daniel Brickwell threatened every member

53
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,320
of local government.

54
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,800
What else was Mayor Castle supposed to do?

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,140
This is worse than negotiating with terrorists.

56
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,070
This...

57
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,650
Tax time.

58
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,910
Brick wants his cut.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,970
Now give me all the cash in your register...

60
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,390
or I'll make your head look like that TV.

61
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,030
I have another idea.

62
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,590
Looks like we got ourselves a real live superhero here.

63
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,340
You that red streak I've been hearing about on TV?

64
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,380
Wrong city.

65
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,850
Either way, I bet Brick will pay us

66
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,080
a finder's fee.

67
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,130
Make the call.

68
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,070
Guns down!

69
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,990
Grant must be some teacher.

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,180
Diner at 10th clear.

71
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,650
Diner's taken care of.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,550
Why are these people calling 911?

73
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,460
Don't they know the police have pulled out of the Glades?

74
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,900
Because they're desperate and scared.

75
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,260
Multiple reports of looting at Western and Oxnard.

76
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,540
Got it. On our way.

77
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,550
Sara?

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,570
Someone's dying here. What are we supposed to do?

79
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,970
You can't just ignore...

80
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,080
It's Lance.

81
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,770
Good. Maybe the cavalry's coming.

82
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,130
Captain Lance?

83
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,240
You guys have been busy.

84
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,600
Just trying to keep things together.

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,330
Doesn't really feel like it's been working.

86
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,920
- How can I help? - Can you?

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,800
I mean, I thought the mayor was

88
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:25,080
pretty specific about Blues staying out of the Glades.

89
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,070
It doesn't mean I can't help out

90
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,940
the hood squad off the books.

91
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,620
We call ourselves Team Arrow.

92
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,170
Well, actually, that's just me, but...

93
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,310
I just got everything we have on Brick

94
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,530
from evidence lockup.

95
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,450
Ok. I'll send Arsenal over once the next brushfire's put out.

96
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,390
Arsenal? What, are you guys just pulling names

97
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,330
out of a hat now?

98
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,300
Felicity, you might want to wrap it up.

99
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,620
We just got two more calls that came in.

100
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,630
Talk soon, Captain.

101
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,430
Then there was this red-hooded guy

102
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,180
and a blond woman all in black.

103
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,980
Change in pattern.

104
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,700
"Disrupt and revise" Just like you said.

105
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,060
Hesitation is death.

106
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,050
I didn't hesitate. I just...

107
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,840
I just didn't kill you.

108
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,040
And when the fight is real?

109
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,280
I'm not a killer.

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,740
Then you're gonna die.

111
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,210
The League of Assassins are called that for a reason.

112
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,050
Mercy is not part of their code.

113
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,010
I didn't sign up for any of this,

114
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,220
the assassins league and no mercy.

115
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,140
All I asked for you to do was to teach me

116
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,260
how to defend myself,

117
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,690
to never let someone hurt me again.

118
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,530
And now you face people who want to kill you.

119
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
To prevent that,

120
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,730
you must kill them first.

121
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,820
It may not be what you signed up for,

122
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,500
but make no mistake-- it's what you face right now.

123
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,780
Thea, I know it's difficult.

124
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,110
I wasn't always a killer.

125
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,920
The first time, I have never been

126
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,800
more frightened or remorseful.

127
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,570
Then why did you do it?

128
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,720
Because the man I killed murdered my wife.

129
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,090
Hey. That's fine.

131
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,340
Put the prospectus on my desk.

132
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,570
We'll get into it tomorrow.

133
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,750
I need to get at least 3 hours' sleep,

134
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,200
so good night

135
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,060
No, no, don't! No, don't!

136
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,830
Tommy.

137
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,220
Hey, Tommy buddy. Come here.

138
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,190
You're just having a nightmare.

139
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,600
-Dad? -Yeah.

140
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,510
I'm here now.

141
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,450
Don't worry.

142
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,000
I won't let anything bad ever happen to you.

143
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,920
Promise?

144
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,150
Promise.

145
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,740
I will always be here for you.

146
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,120
Hey. What--ohh!

147
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,410
What--wow!

148
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,310
Where's your mom?

149
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,850
I don't know.

150
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,650
Ingrid put me to sleep.

151
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,720
Is that mommy?

152
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,870
Probably, so you better go to sleep.

153
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,380
Otherwise, you're gonna get me in trouble!

154
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,340
Captain Lance.

155
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,690
Harper.

156
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,200
I'm not sure what you--

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,360
Look. I've seen you shooting a red hoodie,

158
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,280
I've seen you shooting arrows at people.

159
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,130
You think I don't recognize you

160
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,810
with a little extra leather and lace?

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,630
Well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore.

162
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,920
No. You'll be needing this. Here you go.

163
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,200
What's this?

164
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,000
Everything on Brickwell we could salvage from evidence storage.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,630
May be something in there to help you guys figure out

166
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,110
where he's holed up in the Glades.

167
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,060
Thanks. We'll get Felicity right on this.

168
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,010
Any word on our green-hooded friend?

169
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,210
Still unavailable.

170
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,540
And Sara? I mean, I hear the Canary come up

171
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,850
every so often on the 911 calls.

172
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,830
I'll let her know you were looking for her.

173
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,720
No.

174
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,830
You just watch her back, ok?

175
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,690
Always.

176
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,050
If I don't suture this, it's gonna scar, Laurel.

177
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,150
I'll just add it to my ever-growing collection.

178
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,600
My father give us anything to use to locate Brick?

179
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,970
I don't see how.

180
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,290
Some of this stuff goes back decades.

181
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,890
There is plenty of evidence against Brick,

182
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,010
but there's nothing the police can make stick.

183
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,210
So this is what Brick has reduced us to--

184
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,830
grasping for straws.

185
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,310
I don't know how you guys have done this for so long.

186
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,700
We had Oliver.

187
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,980
What are you doing?

188
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,290
Grasping at straws I'm pretty sure,

189
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,100
but maybe there's something in Brick's M.O.

190
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,410
That would suggest a couple doors for us to kick down.

191
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,630
I mean, for you to kick down.

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,640
What was that?

193
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,650
Cross-reference with Alderman Ford's murder

194
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,180
and the evidence your father gave us.

195
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,790
The same gun was used in a 20-year-old shooting.

196
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,080
The same gun?

197
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,380
Either that's arrogance or stupidity.

198
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,750
In this case, definitely stupidity.

200
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,130
The victim from 20 years ago--

201
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:46,900
Rebecca Merlyn.

202
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,570
Daniel Brickwell killed Malcolm Merlyn's wife.

203
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,890
If you want to tell me "I told you so,"

204
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,670
how about you say it in person?

205
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,700
Just couldn't stay away from me, could you?

206
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,420
What changed your mind?

207
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,420
I've been to enough funerals.

208
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,930
So help me.

209
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,980
That isn't what I have been doing?

210
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,050
The man who Maseo serves,

211
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,800
when he finds out that I'm alive,

212
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,010
he is gonna come for me and my sister.

213
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,870
Ra's Al Ghul.

214
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,040
Yes.

215
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,460
Maseo spoke of him

216
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,940
while you were recuperating.

217
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,500
He fights with swords,

218
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,200
and he's good.

219
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,910
I seem to remember you being pretty good

220
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,380
with a blade yourself.

221
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:14,030
Mastery of swords is more than mastery of technique.

222
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,980
To defeat this man, you must think like him,

223
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,370
be like him.

224
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,040
You must fight in the ways he does.

225
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,780
Your only hope for such a teacher was Maseo.

226
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,530
Only the student has hope

227
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,580
of defeating the master.

228
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,320
Sorry I'm late.

229
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,010
What's going on?

230
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,650
Is it the League?

231
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,870
No. This is personal.

232
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,800
Personal how?

233
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,410
I told you I killed the person who killed my Rebecca.

234
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,180
I recently learned I didn't.

235
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,010
I killed the wrong man.

236
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,300
The guilty party is still alive.

237
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,770
Everything I thought I believed in

238
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,410
for the last 21 years is false.

239
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,020
My wife's death remains unavenged.

240
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,830
So let's go to the police

241
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,020
or Laurel Lance, ok?

242
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,770
She's a friend, and she'll listen.

243
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,240
I swore that I would always protect her from harm,

244
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,350
but I couldn't.

245
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,660
For years, I believed that justice had been done.

246
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,350
The Undertaking was for her.

247
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,780
I truly believed I could change the Glades

248
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,880
and prevent what happened to my family

249
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,920
from happening to anyone else.

250
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,440
It's all been a lie,

251
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,370
but now I have the chance to set it right.

252
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,070
I don't understand.

253
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,410
I know, because you're not a killer,

254
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,720
but I am.

255
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,690
Your dad told me that your mom's an angel now.

256
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,880
I don't want her to be an angel, Ollie.

257
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,630
I want her to go back to being my mom.

258
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,970
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

259
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,140
I have a friend in the police department.

260
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,770
He says that they have a person of interest in Rebecca's--

261
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,400
in the case.

262
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,130
They don't have enough evidence yet

263
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,230
to convict him, but if it were me,

264
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,510
I'd want to know.

265
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,840
So Brick killed Malcolm's wife.

266
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,080
What does that have to do with anything?

267
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,180
It is just another reason for them to share bunk beds in hell,

268
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,000
not that I generally believe in hell,

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,660
but for them, I will make an exception.

270
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,860
Maybe we should get Merlyn to solve

271
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,200
our Brick problem for us.

272
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,590
That's pretty dark.

273
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,370
Laurel, if you don't think things are dark,

274
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,620
you haven't been paying attention.

275
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,060
Even if we did sic Merlyn on Brick,

276
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,300
which I am not advocating,

277
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,610
he would have just as much trouble finding Brick as we've had.

278
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,150
Brick's men have been busy.

279
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,760
They're cutting down cell towers

280
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,230
and disconnecting traffic cams

281
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,580
and staying out of satellite line of sight,

282
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,800
like basically every way I know how to find somebody.

283
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,780
Well, if the cell towers were down,

284
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,030
the how was Brick's crew communicating?

285
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,650
At the diner, his men, they were--

286
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,980
They were using walkies.

287
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,930
Do you think that you could--

288
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,050
I don't know --use those signals to locate Brick?

289
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,290
You haven't been down here that much.

290
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,700
If they're communicating via radio,

291
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
they'll be on the FRS,

292
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,350
somewhere between 462 and 467 megahertz.

293
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,440
If I send out a frequency burst,

294
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,810
I should be able to triangulate their location.

295
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,970
I did not understand one word that you just said,

296
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,370
but Oliver was certainly lucky to have you.

297
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,740
114 Grandview Plaza.

298
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,080
Felicity, that's the Glades precinct.

299
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,780
Well, it's not like the police are using it.

300
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,350
Great.

301
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,590
We can add irony to the list of charges against Brick.

302
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,940
Let's gear up.

304
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,610
Let's go!

305
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,010
Come! Go! Move!

306
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,240
So why don't you explain it to me, boys?

307
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,600
We cleared the register from that diner on 10th.

308
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,710
No. The part where you and had red one

309
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,110
stood in front of your shotgun

310
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,720
and somehow he's still not dead.

311
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,130
Now you know the deal, boys.

312
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,700
You take me down first, you walk out alive.

313
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,580
Ok. I've cut the power.

314
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,960
There's a ventilation shaft 40 feet north

315
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,830
of your current position.

316
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,420
It should drop you off in the east wing.

317
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,090
There are only two sentries there now.

318
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,060
Got it!

319
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,060
If you see anyone, kill them!

321
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,990
You want to get me?

322
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,760
Roy, are you there?

323
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,940
Laurel, can you hear me?

324
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,600
This is what we do when we get you in our sights!

325
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,960
Daniel Brickwell.

326
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,160
What the hell are you supposed to be?

327
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,520
We need to talk.

328
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,580
Somebody please tell me how this is happening again.

329
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,690
Daniel Brickwell.

330
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,960
It seems we have a common interest.

331
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,070
You know that Brickwell killed your wife.

332
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,520
Her name was Rebecca.

333
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,810
Since my death,

334
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,560
maintaining my usual network of associates

335
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,780
has become-- shall we say, problematic,

336
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,390
but the fact that you were able to locate Mr. Brickwell

337
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,450
despite the fact that he has gone to ground

338
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,980
demonstrates your group's capacity.

339
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,220
You followed us. We led you right to him.

340
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,140
And I saved your lives in the bargain.

341
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,950
So why not continue our association?

342
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,800
You want us to team up with you?

343
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
I guess the question before you is

344
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,740
whether your scorn for me outweighs your need

345
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,500
to see Mr. Brickwell dealt with.

346
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,980
You mean killed.

347
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,090
You have your options.

348
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,380
Weigh them.

349
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,790
You stole my idea.

350
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,220
I was gonna lean here and wish my problems away.

351
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,630
That obvious?

352
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,490
So what are your problems?

353
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,930
They're not problems exactly.

354
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,890
More like weighing options.

355
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,750
What about you?

356
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,360
Brick's tax collectors giving you trouble?

357
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,190
No. It's Malcolm, but it's probably

358
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,220
the last thing you want to think about right now.

359
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,790
You'd be surprised.

360
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,970
He found out who murdered his wife.

361
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,790
He's fixated on finding the guy

362
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,370
and killing him.

363
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,500
Don't take this the wrong way,

364
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,350
but isn't killing people exactly what

365
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,700
Malcolm Merlyn does?

366
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,140
Yes, but he also protects people.

367
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,250
During the siege, he was the only one

368
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,230
who made me a top priority.

369
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,030
He saved my life.

370
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,100
I didn't know.

371
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,000
Despite everything Malcolm was or is,

372
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,380
it means something that he was there

373
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,690
when I needed him the most.

374
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,730
Even after everything he's done,

375
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,580
he cares about people.

376
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,720
Even all the terrifying things he's done

377
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,410
it was because he thought that he was helping the Glades.

378
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,480
So what's on your mind?

379
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,540
Anything I can help you with?

380
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,220
Believe it or not, you already have.

381
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,270
How can you even be arguing for this right now?

382
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,560
Because I am actually paying attention.

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,470
Brick has the Glades under siege.

384
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,900
He has the police running scared,

385
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,220
he has us outnumbered and outgunned,

386
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,010
and I am not saying let's give Malcolm a glass case of his own.

387
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,310
All I am saying is let's use him.

388
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,300
The same way that he wants to use us.

389
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,040
To point him like a loaded gun at Brick.

390
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,610
Exactly.

391
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,000
Well, A, I'm not ok with that,

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,220
and, B, even if I was, there has to be

393
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,470
a better way to go about doing it

394
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,280
than to get in bed with Malcolm Merlyn.

395
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,210
There isn't.

396
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,060
Oliver is gone,

397
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,370
and there's only so much the 4 of us can do.

398
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,280
I just found this out,

399
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,550
but the night of the siege, Malcolm saved Thea's life.

400
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,340
He didn't have an ulterior motive,

401
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,110
he didn't have an agenda.

402
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,300
He just wanted to protect what he cared about.

403
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,620
He cares about this city.

404
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,830
He just went about it in a completely unimaginable way.

405
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,220
So just like Thea did the night of the siege,

406
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,460
we need him.

407
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,660
I can't think of a world or a universe

408
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,690
or a plain of existence where Oliver would agree

409
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,030
to any of this.

410
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,310
Well, Oliver isn't here anymore,

411
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,460
so we need to stop pretending like he is.

412
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,850
We need to make decisions of our own.

413
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,790
I genuinely have no idea how else

414
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,970
we're supposed to stop Brick.

415
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,080
And I genuinely don't know how we live with ourselves

416
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,610
if we go about doing it this way!

417
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,880
So how does this work?

418
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,080
Do we vote?

419
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,070
Has the jury reached a verdict?

420
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,220
It has.

421
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,450
Guilty.

422
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,760
I guess that means no then.

423
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,860
You were expecting something different, Merlyn?

424
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,260
That you'd have some measure of common sense? Yes.

425
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,840
You really thought we'd throw in with you?

426
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,060
After what you did to Thea, to Sara,

427
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,700
to Oliver?

428
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,720
To save your precious city, yes.

429
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,890
Well, that's the thing.

430
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,710
Once we let the ends justify the means,

431
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,630
that's just the first step.

432
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,460
Towards what?

433
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,770
Becoming you.

434
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,820
Excuse me, excuse me.

435
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,720
I think I'm lost.

436
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,750
I suggest you run real fast

437
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,560
before I swipe that nice watch of yours.

438
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,930
Do you enjoy robbing people?

439
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,870
I mean, it can't be for the money.

440
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,610
You can't steal enough wallets and watches to live on.

441
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,290
What the hell is wrong with you, man?

442
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,270
Wait.

443
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,600
I just want to understand.

444
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,530
I want to know what drives a man to do what you do,

445
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,940
to ruin other men's lives.

446
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,550
Want my watch?

447
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,320
Here. Take it.

448
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,150
Because you've already taken everything from me.

449
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,610
You're not gonna shoot me.

450
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,470
I bet you've never even held a gun before.

451
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,370
Go back to your rich neighborhood.

452
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,350
Is it safe?

453
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,920
Safer than a boat.

454
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,460
Your medicine.

455
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,200
Apply twice a day.

456
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,540
Ok.

457
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,990
Tatsu.

458
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,420
Why don't you come with me?

459
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,360
So I can watch you die at the hand of Maseo's master?

460
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,410
I do not intend to die.

461
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,530
There are many forms of death.

462
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,780
To defeat a man like this Ra's Al Ghul,

463
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,200
you must be willing not just to die

464
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,730
but to live knowing what you had to sacrifice

465
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,250
in order to beat him.

466
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,630
And what will that be?

467
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,540
I don't know.

468
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:44,060
That is what you will have to discover,

469
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,660
but it will be whatever you hold most precious.

470
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,770
Going out?

471
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,370
How did you get in here?

472
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,740
I had a good teacher.

473
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,640
If you've come to tell me what a horrible person I am,

474
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,710
I'm afraid you'll have to wait in a very long line.

475
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,360
Actually, I'm here to do the opposite.

476
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,260
Told Roy about that night at the train station,

477
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,990
how you saved my life.

478
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,540
You're my daughter.

479
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,100
You protected me, risked your life for me

480
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,770
just like my mother did.

481
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,420
Thea, I know you want to believe

482
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,890
there's more to me than a killer,

483
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,000
but the fact is, there's not.

484
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,200
That man died with his wife.

485
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,930
What happened to your face?

486
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,300
Is it all there?

487
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,920
Yeah. 50,000 in hundreds.

488
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,890
You went after Kendrick Weller.

489
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,730
Hey. What-- what did you do?

490
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,910
You killed him, and now you're running?

491
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,270
We can-- we can cover this up.

492
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,020
I can't stay here.

493
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:36,270
I can't pretend to be something that I'm not.

494
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,450
Your son needs you, Malcolm.

495
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,330
Not like this.

496
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,730
Killing him did nothing.

497
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,560
It didn't bring her back.

498
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,850
It didn't cleanse this anger.

499
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,660
I've heard about a place

500
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,490
where anger can be forged into something else.

501
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,760
Daddy?

502
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,200
Tommy, hey.

503
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,400
What are you doing up? Look. Go back to sleep.

504
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,840
I miss mommy.

505
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,690
Tommy, I have to go away for a little while.

506
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,380
You can't leave.

507
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,040
You said you'd always be there.

508
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,140
I know, but you have to be strong now.

509
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,190
I'm going somewhere where I can learn

510
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,000
how to make sure that no one

511
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,840
will ever hurt us again.

512
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,870
Come here.

513
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,030
How'd Merlyn take it?

514
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,190
I think he just felt inconvenienced.

515
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,340
We made the right choice, right,

516
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,130
by refusing Merlyn's help?

517
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,530
I don't know if we made the right choice, Laurel,

518
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,230
but we definitely did the right thing.

519
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,160
And how many people are gonna die tonight because of it?

520
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,610
We made a decision, Roy.

521
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,000
I know, and I know that I was outvoted,

522
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,920
but that doesn't change the fact that we're outmanned.

523
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,320
What if it doesn't? Roy's right.

524
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,190
We need the support out there,

525
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,460
but Merlyn-- he's not the only person in town.

526
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,750
Who else is there?

527
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,410
The town.

528
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,200
You've been busy.

529
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,290
Ted, I was--

530
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,410
I said you weren't ready.

531
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,070
Guess you weren't listening,

532
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,740
or are you gonna tell me that masked blond

533
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,150
that I seen on the news isn't you?

534
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,360
It's complicated.

535
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,660
I couldn't wait.

536
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,470
I didn't come here to argue with you.

537
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,160
What did you come here for?

538
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,880
That a Monte Cristo?

539
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,150
Those will kill you a lot quicker

540
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,320
than being in this neighborhood.

541
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,510
Abercrombie!

542
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,260
Where the hell have you been?

543
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,240
I saw Sara last night.

544
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,610
Why didn't you tell me she was back?

545
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,700
We need to talk about that after.

546
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,070
After what?

547
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,980
Feels like recess and we're about to fight the school bully.

548
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,740
Looks quiet.

549
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,240
For now.

550
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,870
You ready?

551
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,370
It's ok to say you're scared.

552
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,180
Ok. I'm scared.

553
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,420
Is what we're doing crazy?

554
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,910
I've learned it's better to ask that question

555
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,400
when I'm not wearing a mask.

556
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,430
There's never been an armed occupation in history

557
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,010
that wasn't overthrown by force.

558
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,120
An all-out assault on Brick.

559
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,590
That's the only way to end this.

560
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,710
Then let's end this

561
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,830
one way

562
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,130
or the other.

563
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,600
Let's go.

565
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,830
My two favorite trick-or-treaters.

566
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,150
Well, look at that.

567
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,820
Didn't anybody tell you Halloween was 3 months ago?

568
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,360
Daniel Brickwell...

569
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,610
You have failed this city.

570
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,600
And you seem to have failed in your maths.

571
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,120
Can't you see there's a lot more of us

572
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,230
than there is of you?

573
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,700
Guess again, Brick-head.

574
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,930
Is this little parade supposed to mean something?

575
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,600
I'll tell you what it means.

576
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,430
It means the population of the Glades

577
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,040
is gonna plummet severely.

578
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,360
Get them!

579
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,420
And which costume are you supposed to be?

580
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,590
Wildcat.

581
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,490
Is that all you got?

582
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,690
I've learned you can survive a bullet

583
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,850
but not one that's put through you head.

584
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,520
You're gonna be fine.

585
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,410
Really?

586
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,070
How many more of you masks are there?

587
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,340
It's ok.

588
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,360
It's good thing you fight better than you lie.

589
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,800
Oliver?

590
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,620
This is for Rebecca.

591
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,730
What?

592
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,680
You don't even know her name, do you?

593
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,910
Is this the weapon you used to murder my wife?

594
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,660
Everybody I dropped was with that piece.

595
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,340
She was a good person, decent, kind.

596
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,300
She ran the clinic right here in the Glades.

597
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,100
Brunette?

598
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,770
Yeah. Now I remember.

599
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,930
She was my first,

600
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,580
my initiation into the Orchid Bay Butchers.

601
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,560
You murdered her because you wanted into a gang?

602
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,680
No.

603
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,910
Because she was weak!

604
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,390
Because she was crying, begging me not to kill her,

605
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,900
but you won't get that from me, so come on!

606
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,230
Finish it!

607
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,460
Don't do it!

608
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,020
You are too late.

609
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,770
Drop the gun.

610
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,670
No more death.

611
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,080
That's easy for you to say.

612
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,540
You just returned from the grave.

613
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,900
Killing him won't balance the scales.

614
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:26,800
When you have killed 503 people,

615
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,150
including your own son,

616
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,220
you tend not to worry about scales,

617
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,180
and don't tell me it won't stop the pain

618
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,130
and it won't bring her back

619
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,400
because you don't understand!

620
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,790
If I had taken care of him back then,

621
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,880
it could all be different.

622
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,070
The League, the Undertaking,

623
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,510
Tommy...

624
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:55,460
every choice I have made since my wife died.

625
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,920
Then you make a different choice now for Thea.

626
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,770
Thea will never forgive me.

627
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,110
Start giving her reasons to.

628
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,480
Listen to me. I'm telling you.

629
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,690
My guys say he's out of commission.

630
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,100
We can go back in.

631
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,670
I got to call you back.

632
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,170
There's something I got to go see.

633
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,720
I've been gone, and I'm sorry,

634
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,810
sorry for what the city has had to endure in my absence,

635
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,430
but you did endure it,

636
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,150
and the evidence of that struggle

637
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,980
is lying at my feet.

639
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,070
You did not fail this city,

640
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,480
and I promise

641
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,530
I will not fail you

642
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,340
by leaving it again.

643
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,100
I want every block turned upside down,

644
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,260
inside out till each of Brick's dirtbags

645
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,020
are lying on comfy cots in Iron Heights, all right?

646
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,350
Hey. Thanks, Captain.

647
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,700
You should see a doctor.

648
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,220
No health insurance, but thanks for bringing the cops back.

649
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,640
Words I never thought I'd say.

650
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,660
Cindy, right?

651
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,670
Sin. Yeah. I'm friends with your daughter Sara.

652
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,180
Yeah, yeah. I thought you looked familiar.

653
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,320
Haven't seen you in a while.

654
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,220
Well, I haven't seen Sara in a while.

655
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,150
Well, then you missed some major ass-kicking tonight.

656
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,180
That woman running around in black leather tonight,

657
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,740
that wasn't Sara.

658
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,100
Well, sure it was. Who else would it be?

659
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,070
Well, I don't know. That's why I'm talking to you.

660
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,680
What do mean? I've spoken to her.

661
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,790
Well, then you should know that wasn't your daughter.

662
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,130
You ok?

663
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,080
Yeah. Everything's fine.

664
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,410
I just wanted to see you.

665
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,620
I was worried.

666
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,490
But are you ok?

667
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,640
I am, in fact.

668
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,440
I didn't do it.

669
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,760
For me?

670
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,170
For me

671
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,000
but because of you.

672
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,530
Is my room still available?

673
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,070
Where have you been?

674
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,430
I've been so worried about you.

675
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,070
I was in Bludhaven.

676
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,260
Ran into an old friend of mine,

677
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,960
things got interesting,

678
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,980
and I actually spent the past few weeks in jail.

679
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,870
I thought you grew out of that.

680
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,870
So did I.

681
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,570
- Ollie... - It's ok.

682
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,910
Good to see you again, Oliver.

683
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,040
Yeah.

684
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,440
I think I'm hallucinating, but thank you

685
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,160
for being cool with this.

686
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,700
I-I'm gonna make some tea

687
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,100
and try to keep things zen.

688
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,420
Thank you for not making this difficult for her.

689
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,260
I wasn't always like this, you know?

690
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,550
Before Rebecca died, I was a good father.

691
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,730
I remember.

692
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,110
Killing changes you.

693
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,990
It takes away a piece of your soul,

694
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,670
and you can never get it back again.

695
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,630
Oliver, I know I wasn't there for Tommy,

696
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,740
but I see Thea as my chance for redemption.

697
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,480
You turned my sister into a killer,

698
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,200
and then you put her in the crosshairs

699
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,150
of one of the most dangerous men on the planet.

700
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,050
You won't believe me, but I did so

701
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,210
with a heavy heart and expecting a different outcome.

702
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,280
Ra's is going to come for me,

703
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,590
and he will learn the truth about Sara eventually.

704
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,510
And then he will come for Thea and me.

705
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,310
That's why I have to kill him.

706
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,660
You couldn't before.

707
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,960
This time, I will have you to train me.

708
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,760
Only the student has hope of defeating the master.

709
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,130
I am Nyssa, heir to the demon.

710
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,410
I'm not here to fight you.

711
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,470
There's no other reason to be here.

712
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,440
Why shouldn't I kill you.

713
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,340
What does that mean?

714
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,760
The Magician.

715
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,070
Sorry that I didn't come by sooner.

716
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,220
I just wanted to check in on Thea.

717
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,850
It's ok.

718
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:57,920
I'm ok.

719
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,750
Merlyn told us you were killed.

720
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:02,150
I was close.

721
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,300
I'm sorry that I didn't reach out sooner.

722
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,390
I wasn't exactly in a cell service area.

723
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,070
You kept the city together...

724
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,860
saved the Glades.

725
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,580
Well done.

726
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,080
It's gift from Malcolm Merlyn.

727
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,350
He went looking for you.

728
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,270
- It's Ra's Al Ghul's, right? - Yep.

729
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,680
So what are we gonna do about him?

730
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,990
I mean, if he finds out about Thea...

731
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,470
Merlyn and I are working on that.

732
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,520
Sorry?

733
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,530
For a second there, it sounded like you said, "Merlyn."

734
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,600
I need to know how to defeat Ra's.

735
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,240
Merlyn has the knowledge.

736
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,070
Merlyn is a monster.

737
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,390
You're in this situation, Thea is in this situation

738
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,430
because of him.

739
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,660
- Felicity... - No. Just a few hours ago,

740
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,230
I stood right here, and I swore

741
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,250
that there was no way that you would ever agree

742
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,360
to work with Malcolm Merlyn, not ever.

743
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,150
I guess I was wrong about everything.

744
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,640
I need some air.

745
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,530
I'm glad you're not dead.

746
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,330
Felicity.

747
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,760
"I need some air" really means

748
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,680
"I don't want to talk right now."

749
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,240
I'm sorry.

750
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,670
For what?

751
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,310
Maybe you could be a little more specific.

752
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,180
For letting us believe you were dead

753
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,350
for weeks

754
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,910
or for abandoning every principle you claim to have

755
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,230
by getting into bed with Malcolm Merlyn.

756
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,370
That's not why you're upset.

757
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,650
While you were gone

758
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:52,410
for almost a month,

759
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,810
I allowed myself to fantasize,

760
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,550
to dream that maybe, just maybe

761
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,190
Merlyn was wrong,

762
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,690
that you were alive

763
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,250
and that you would come back

764
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,590
and that when you did

765
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,950
you would be different,

766
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,940
that almost dying would give you

767
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,800
a new perspective on life,

768
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:20,110
that you would just do things differently.

769
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,640
Things between us, you mean.

770
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,510
Before you left,

771
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,920
the last thing you said to me...

772
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,760
was that you loved me.

773
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,910
Now you're back,

774
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,880
and the first thing you tell me

775
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,490
is that you are working with the man

776
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,350
who turned your sister, a woman you're supposed to love,

777
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,180
into a killer,

778
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,420
who killed a woman you used to love.

779
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:54,970
I don't want to be a woman that you love.
