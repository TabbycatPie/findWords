21
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,780
Mister?

22
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,410
Ladies and gentlemen,

23
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,850
welcome to San Jose International Airport.

25
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,180
Help!

26
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,990
- Adam?! - Oh, my God!

27
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,050
Adam?!

28
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,280
Somebody call 911!

29
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,270
Oh, my God!

30
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,530
I'm a doctor, let me take a look. Let me take a look.

31
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,840
His jugular vein's been cut.

32
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,090
Does anyone have a clean cloth?

33
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,150
Please. Someone!

34
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,430
I have a fresh change of clothes in my bag.

35
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,330
That's great.

36
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,800
You're killing him.

37
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm saving his life. He was bleeding out.

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,780
N-- You have it in the wrong place.

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,550
I think I remember enough of Anatomy 101

40
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,010
to know where the jugular vein is.

41
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,270
You would be in the right place if he were an adult.

42
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,140
He's not an adult. He is a boy.

43
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,670
Which means you're also putting pressure on his trachea.

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,460
Which means he's not currently breathing.

45
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,740
You have to put the pressure higher up.

46
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,080
There. ?

47
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,700
Some glass. He'll be fine.

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,510
Who are you?

49
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,570
Hello. I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

50
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,860
I'm a surgical resident at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

51
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,540
Autism -- a mental condition characterized by difficulty 

52
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,690
in communicating and using language and abstract concepts.

53
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,080
That's the definition.

54
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,560
Does it sound like I'm describing a surgeon?

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,190
He's not Rain Man.

57
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,720
He's high functioning, he's capable of living on his own,

58
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,990
capable of managing his own affairs.

59
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,400
"High functioning"?

60
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,750
Is that our new hiring standard?

61
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,350
If it were, you wouldn't be here.

62
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm sorry. Is this really necessary? Really?

63
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,690
A special meeting of the Board of Directors --

64
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,520
as much as I love you all --

65
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,440
questioning one of my hiring decisions?

66
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,520
Did you bother to look up the definition of "President"

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,910
while you were skimming the dictionary?

68
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,950
You're hiring him to be a surgical resident --

69
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,680
my department -- over my objections.

70
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,110
Marcus, stop making everything so personal.

71
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,250
I made it personal?

72
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,850
You've wanted his job since day one.

73
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,230
Everyone in this room knows that.

74
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,390
And, Aaron, yes, this is your hospital.

75
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,040
But the money it takes to run it comes from the Foundation I control.

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,570
So let's all play nice, shall we?

77
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,110
Stop acting like you're stunned that you're standing there.

78
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,760
You tried to slip one past us.

79
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,610
I vetted him like I would any other candidate.

80
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,400
And you genuinely thought that this Board

81
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,120
wouldn't reasonably have any doubts 

82
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,080
about hiring a surgeon who's been diagnosed with autism?

83
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,270
So justify your decision.

84
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,280
I met Shaun Murphy when he was 14 years old.

85
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,740
I was living in Wyoming at the time.

86
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,630
He was, and he still is, an extraordinary young man.

87
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,790
Yes, he has autism, but he also has savant syndrome --

88
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,350
genius-level skills in several areas.

89
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,090
He has almost perfect recall. He has spatial intelligence.

90
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,450
And he sees things and analyzes things 

91
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,860
in ways that -- that are just remarkable.

92
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,040
In ways that we can't even begin to understand.

93
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,990
Those are assets. Undeniable assets for any doctor, 

94
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,930
particularly a surgeon.

95
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,330
You've known him since he was 14?

96
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,430
You care about him. He's like a son to you.

97
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,410
Dr. Andrews, your wife is gonna be very upset with you.

98
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,070
If you're trying to turn this into a nepotism case,

99
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,630
we're gonna have to fire her idiot nephew from bookkeeping.

100
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,410
Sorry. You seen Claire?

101
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,590
Would you turn off the light?

102
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,840
Sure. You seen Claire?

103
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,970
Why? Would you turn off the light?

104
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,750
Melendez wants to operate on 104,

105
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,800
but Claire hasn't gotten informed consent.

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,190
And she's ignoring her page. You seen her?

107
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:01,320
No. Now go away and turn off the light.

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,330
Sure.

109
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,120
They need you to, um...

110
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,750
I heard.

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,250
Oh, she's such a bitch.

112
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,310
No.

113
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,110
She just doesn't like you.

114
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,360
It's kind of silly, isn't it?

115
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,250
Maybe.

116
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,500
To say for sure, 

117
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,630
I'd need to know what it is you're talking about.

118
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,960
Us.

119
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,500
Not silly at all.

120
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,070
Quite a bit of fun, actually.

121
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,570
I meant that we're hiding it. Our relationship.

122
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,900
Jared, we don't have a relationship.

123
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,880
We have sex.

124
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,480
But, if you want to tell people

125
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,850
that you're screwing me, go for it.

132
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,570
The veins in the boy's left arm are popping.

133
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,400
Is that bad?

134
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,810
I-I don't see.

135
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,260
Intrathoracic pressure.

136
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,370
No, his chest is rising. He's breathing.

137
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,120
No, the -- the chest is moving paradoxically.

138
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,720
The left lung is in distress.

141
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:48,750
Yes.

142
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,180
Who here has a sharp knife, blade five inches or longer?

143
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,710
Nobody?

144
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,850
You should start artificial respiration.

145
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,660
He's going to stop breathing very soon.

146
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,290
I feel fine.

147
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,050
Dr. Melendez would like to do the surgery today.

148
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,700
You need bypass surgery quite urgently.

149
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,920
Would you please sign the consent?

150
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,000
No.

151
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,560
You're scared.

152
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,060
I-I'm not scared.

153
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,080
Well, you should be.

154
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,750
We're gonna cut your chest open,

155
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,780
we're gonna stop your heart,

156
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,720
repair it and restart it.

157
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,180
Are you seriously telling me that that doesn't scare you?

158
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,960
I just want a second opinion.

159
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,860
Callum, yesterday, your life was perfect.

160
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,190
You were playing tennis, you had a big anniversary.

161
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,370
Today, you're lying in a hospital bed

162
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,640
trying to figure out the best way to say goodbye,

163
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,820
maybe forever, to your teenage children.

164
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,230
Why are you doing this?

165
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,080
Because I can't deal with lies.

166
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,350
If you lie to me, my answers won't help you.

167
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,210
But, if you're scared, I can help you.

168
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,620
I'm scared.

169
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,300
Okay.

170
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,720
- You can't be back here. - Oh, I need a knife.

171
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,720
Where do you keep the knives

172
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,220
people forget they're traveling with?

173
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,920
A knife? Sure. Anything else?

174
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,390
I do also need a narrow six-foot tube

175
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,440
and high-proof alcohol and gloves and baggage-handling tape,

176
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,680
but I am going to get the alcohol from the duty-free store

177
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,690
and the tube from the back of a soda machine.

178
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,190
Well, I wish you all the luck with that.

179
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,900
But I'm not gonna give you a knife.

180
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,540
No, I need a knife. It-It's -- It's very --

181
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,710
There is a medical emergency. There's a medical emergency.

182
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,480
That one. That one,

183
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,380
right near the top, looks very sharp.

184
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,330
Would you get it for me?

185
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,780
No, I'm not gonna give you a knife. I'll ask --

186
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,170
?There's not the time.

187
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,860
Weapon! Weapon!

188
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,020
Move! Get out of the way!

189
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,930
Drop it.

190
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,600
You idiot! You're lucky we didn't just shoot.

191
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,240
No! He's trying to save my son's life.

192
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,550
You get that consent on 104?

193
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,270
Well, I made him a deal.

194
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,370
He's got a meeting with Dr. Max from psychiatry at 6:00,

195
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,880
we'll get the consent by 8:00,

196
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,560
we can operate first thing in the morning.

197
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,520
You did pass anatomy, right, Dr. Browne?

198
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,920
His problem's in his heart, not his head.

199
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,840
He's not psychologically ready for surgery.

200
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,190
He will be. Soon.

201
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,410
Well, he is physically ready.

202
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,500
So, get the consent.

203
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,580
We're prepping O.R. 6 now.

204
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,600
Do I need to cite you the 17 studies that show a correlation 

205
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,120
between attitude and outcome in surgical patients?

206
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,060
Do I need to remind you that I am your superior?

207
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,700
You do know what the opposite of superior is, right?

208
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,600
Subordinate. Doesn't --

209
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,350
Sure. Subordinate. Or...inferior.

210
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,080
Either way.

211
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,750
It doesn't mean I'm wrong.

212
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,620
I suppose not.

213
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,900
But it does mean you have to act like you're wrong.

214
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,400
He's panic stricken.

215
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,560
Yesterday, he was young and healthy.

216
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,850
Today, he's mortal.

217
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,770
Just give him a chance to wrap his head around that.

218
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,750
Dr. Kalu?

219
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,230
Do you think you can get me a signed informed consent on 104?

220
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,060
Of course.

221
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:17,780
Thank you.

222
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,930
You think he's right?

223
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,730
I think he's my boss.

224
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,570
And if I have to choose between my boss and...

225
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,640
the woman I'm screwing,

226
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,910
not much of a choice, am I right?

227
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,750
Excuse me. Excuse me, please?

229
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,870
The incision should take place two ribs down.

230
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,380
Okay, well, why the bottle?

231
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,320
The air will continue to leak and accumulate

232
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,490
until the damage can be properly repaired.

233
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,890
The tube allows the air to get out.

234
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,300
The water in the bottle stops the air from coming back in.

235
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,390
A homemade one-way valve.

236
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,600
He's breathing.

237
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,290
You saved his life.

238
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,880
He saved his life!

240
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,200
Shaun, where are you? I-I --

241
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,850
Call me as soon as you can, please.

242
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,390
- That was a mistake. - ?I agree,

243
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,380
'cause it's not about the new doctor, this is about you.

244
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,310
They're baiting you. And you're letting them.

245
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,610
- Maybe. ?- Maybe what?

246
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,000
What mistake are you talking about?

247
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,450
Your shot at Andrews' nephew.

248
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,800
Oh, come on. It was funny.

249
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,700
It was very funny. It was also disrespectful.

250
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,900
Well, you don't show him respect.

251
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,480
I assume it's because you don't respect him.

252
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,560
You show someone respect because you respect them,

253
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,620
or because you're afraid of them.

254
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,210
I don't fit into either category.

255
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,420
Well, neither do I.

256
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,630
You should.

257
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,610
You're only in that room 

258
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,790
because your grandfather founded this hospital.

259
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,790
I'm gonna pretend that this conversation didn't take this tangent, 

260
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,440
and instead focus on something relevant -- 

261
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,800
the debate you are losing.

262
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,940
Here's how you win this.

263
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,870
You don't make it personal. You do not make it about you.

264
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,080
That is what they want, and if you give it to them,

265
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,570
you will lose.

266
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,810
I need to get to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

267
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:38,970
That's where we're going.

268
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,950
Good.

269
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,840
How hard can it be to just act like a normal human being?!

270
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,110
- He doesn't know how. - Bull!

271
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,220
What are we supposed to do now? Huh?

272
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,150
This is the third school he's been thrown out of.

273
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,210
We'll find another school.

274
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,470
No, we won't, 'cause nothing's gonna change.

275
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,280
They can't handle him, and I don't blame them,

276
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,320
'cause obviously, we can't handle him, either.

277
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,600
What the hell happened this time?

278
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,920
What happened?!

279
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,250
You're hurting him.

280
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,010
What did you do?!

281
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,350
- Shaun! - ?No!

282
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,740
Will you stop petting that stupid rabbit?!

283
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,300
It changed.

284
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,520
The boy's ECG changed.

285
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,640
It's the same -- 86 BPM.

286
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,620
No. It used to be higher.

287
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,210
No, it used to be 86. It's still 86.

288
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,740
It used to come up to here.

289
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,330
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.

290
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,560
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.

291
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,070
What's going on? What does it mean?

292
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,130
It means he's trying to read 20-year-old equipment

293
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,590
while traveling in a vehicle going 40 miles an hour.

294
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,330
How did you get him to sign?

295
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,210
I simply told him it was either consenting or going home,

296
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,340
then I gave him two forms and told him to pick one.

297
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,880
And you highlighted the Release Against Medical Advice form

298
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,050
that mentions the "Possibility of death or permanent disability"?

299
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,070
Well done.

300
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,010
Hand me the Metz and a pick-up.

301
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,870
I'm isolating the descending aorta.

302
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,960
Vascular clamp.

303
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,620
What is that?

304
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,690
Under the left atrium...

305
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,300
something white.

306
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,690
Is that part of the lung?

307
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,080
It's pus.

308
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,930
Did he have TB?

309
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,950
No, he doesn't have any--

310
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,100
No, not currently. Does he have a history--

311
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,090
When he was younger, he was exposed to --

312
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,770
This is an abscess. It's gonna bur--

313
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,500
Suction and a lap sponge. His BP's crashing.

314
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,040
Two liters saline wide open.

315
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,660
Set up the level one. Two units packed cells now.

316
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,520
Get Levophed on board and keep that MAP at 60.

317
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,810
Get in there with the suction. I can't see a damn thing.

318
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,590
Suction.

319
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,110
I hope it isn't too upsetting to him 

320
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,350
when he hears he would have died in his room

321
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,010
if we'd waited until tomorrow.

322
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,330
Dr. Melendez, we've got an incoming 8-year-old male,

323
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,590
pneumothorax stabilized,

324
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,260
but undetermined internal injuries.

325
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,310
Who do you want to catch?

326
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,090
Claire, I don't think we need you.

327
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,360
This patient is gonna be fine...now.

328
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,660
8-year-old healthy boy,

329
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,480
status post encounter with a shattered glass sign.

330
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,620
Numerous lacerations.

331
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,600
- Echo -- - Get him set up in Trauma 3 with an EKG, 

332
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,140
full blood work and a pan-scan.

333
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,160
We need an echo-- echocardiogram.

334
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,010
Who is this guy?

335
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,590
He helped with first-aid at the airport.

336
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,030
I'm the doctor. He needs an echocardiogram.

337
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,560
- Where are you taking him? - To surgery.

338
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,650
All cardiac vital signs are within normal range.

339
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,850
Do you have any I.D.?

340
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,720
No. His... his heart. It's his heart.

341
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,740
His heart is fine. Now stay here.

342
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,550
Adam needs an echocardiogram.

343
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,290
No. Behave yourself. Or you'll be removed from the building.

344
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,860
Echo. Echo.

345
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:02,690
What's that?

346
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,630
A one-way valve.

347
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:07,440
And he reports the boy suffered a pneumothorax.

348
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,330
That is cool.

349
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,700
Do you think we should do an echocardiogram?

350
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,540
Based on the presenting symptoms,

351
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,630
which give no indication that an echocardiogram is necessary,

352
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,380
I'm going to answer no.

353
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,680
Am I missing something?

354
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,020
No, sir.

355
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:31,700
Knife.

356
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,230
We don't normally treat rabbits, especially --

357
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,850
This was the closest doctor place, and it was an emergency.

358
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,730
No, I can see that.

359
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,540
But even if I was a vet, the rabbit...is dead.

360
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sorry, guys.

361
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,850
Everything smells different when it rains.

362
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,210
What do we do now?

363
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,480
Well, you should bury him, I guess.

364
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,960
I don't know, give him a -- a nice funeral.

365
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,530
Has he gone to heaven?

366
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,920
Yeah, sure. Uh, sure -- sure, he has. Um...

367
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,750
No, I don't want him to go to heaven! I want him to be here!

368
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,110
This won't happen again.

369
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,710
It can't happen again. He's dead.

370
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,660
I know that.

371
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,250
I mean, nothing like this is ever going to happen to us,

372
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,360
ever again.

373
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,950
Because we're not going home.

374
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,000
We're never going home again.

375
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,120
We have each other, and that's all we need.

376
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,350
A surgeon needs to communicate --

377
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,870
not just information,

378
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,660
but sympathy, empathy.

379
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,160
Can Dr. Murphy do that?

380
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,700
He can't even reliably show up for a job interview.

381
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,040
Are you gonna sit here and tell us that there were

382
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,800
no other equally-qualified young surgeons --

383
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,540
surgeons without this one's...issues?

384
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:00,910
No.

385
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,230
Which is why -- exactly why -- we should hire Shaun.

386
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,080
We should hire him because he is qualified

387
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,170
and because he is different.

388
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,970
How long ago was it that we wouldn't hire

389
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,520
black doctors in this hospital?

390
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,910
How m-- How long ago was it that we wouldn't hire

391
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,170
female doctors at this hospital?

392
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,450
So, you're comparing being African-American

393
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,980
or a woman with being autistic.

394
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,080
Please, go on...

395
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,480
Okay.

396
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,730
The rationalization is exactly the same.

397
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,100
Words like "Temperament" and, 

398
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,900
"Oh, no! How are the patients going to react?"

399
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,110
Aren't we judged by how we treat people?

400
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,100
I don't mean as doctors. I mean as people.

401
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,420
Especially those who-- who don't have the same advantages that we have.

402
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,100
We hire Shaun, and we give hope to those people with limitations

403
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,420
that those limitations are not what they think they are,

404
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,920
that they do have a shot!

405
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,490
We hire Shaun, and we make this hospital better for it.

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,920
We hire Shaun, and we are better people for it.

407
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,530
We'd be "better people,"

408
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,390
spending a lot more on malpractice insurance.

409
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,820
- How old is this kid again? - 8.

410
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,690
Spong stick.

411
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,760
What was his heart rate five minutes ago?

412
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,220
Uh, 86.

413
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,920
You sure?

414
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,560
Certain. He's been a rock. It's barely changed.

415
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,720
No, something's changed. Something's different.

416
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,750
You asked earlier about an echo.

417
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,060
You had no medical reason, but you asked anyway. Why?

418
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,710
There was this weird guy, the one that did the one-way valve,

419
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,080
he kept insisting that the boy needed an echocardiogram.

420
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,930
He didn't say why?

421
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,880
H-He was really weird.

422
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,980
His blood pressure's dropping. That makes no sense.

423
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,090
He's not bleeding anymore. Everything's under control.

424
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,730
Do an echo.

425
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,050
Sir, the boy is wide open. It's gonna take a while.

426
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,480
Good. That'll give me time to figure out

427
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,050
why the hell we're doing an echo.

428
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,300
Dr. Browne, you're with me.

429
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,580
We're gonna go find your weird guy.

430
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,740
Keep him stable.

431
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,470
Why the echo?

432
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,860
Okay. He, uh -- He -- Okay.

433
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,260
Uh, he -- Uh, I, uh -- He --

434
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,160
Okay. I understand you think he needs an echocardiogram.

435
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,570
We just don't know why.

436
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,310
Well, I-I noticed that there was a slight reduction

437
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,640
in the intensity of the electrocardiogram.

438
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,860
The electrical flow -- I noticed that, too.

439
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
The heart rate was the same, but the amplitude dropped.

440
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,800
Pericardial effusion.

441
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,000
Reduced cardiac output.

442
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,640
Would stress other organs.

443
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,200
Causing them to shut down.

444
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,010
Yes.

445
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,460
Hold on.

446
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,100
Yeah, we're coming right back up --

447
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,730
Thank you.

448
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,730
They did the echo. It's normal.

449
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,950
No pericardial effusion.

450
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,730
No. It has to be. There -- There is no other explanation.

451
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,020
The echo is normal, which means we just wasted our time.

452
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,380
N-No.

453
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,250
Okay, um, hey, come with me.

454
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,000
Come on.

455
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,860
Show them.

456
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,480
Again.

457
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,430
Again.

459
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,010
Again.

460
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,360
There.

461
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,470
Looks normal to me.

462
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,140
It's not normal.

463
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,000
There's a concave deformity in the right atrium.

464
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,770
No, there's not.

465
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,940
Yeah. Yes, there is. It's very subtle.

466
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,830
Even if you are right,

467
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,490
that's not where a pericardial effusion manifests.

468
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,120
Not usually.

469
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,090
But it -- it could.

470
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,200
This kid was sprayed with glass shards -- cut his jugular.

471
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,480
What if a piece of glass entered his blood stream?

472
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,510
It could have traveled down the jugular vein,

473
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,030
into the brachiocephalic vein

474
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,780
and on to the superior vena cava.

477
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,310
If it punctured the SVC, 

478
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,340
blood could be leaking behind the heart,

479
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,390
restricting the heart's ability to expand and fill during diastole,

480
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,060
reducing the heart's efficiency.

481
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,360
Lot of ifs there.

482
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,750
Dr. Chen, pair of 14-gauge on a syringe.

483
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,060
All in favor of ratifying Dr. Glassman's decision

484
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,810
in hiring Dr. Shaun Murphy?

485
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,840
All against.

486
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:21,960
Excuse me.

487
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,300
Is this a medical emergency?

488
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,580
No. No medical emergency --

489
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,480
Then you weren't supposed to interrupt --

490
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,860
Yes, I know, but you need to go online.

491
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,010
- What? What site? - Pretty much any of them --

492
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,350
Twitter, YouTube, any local news site.

493
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,190
He saved his life!

494
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:46,590
The YouTube clip already has over 200,000 views.

495
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,580
Apparently, he's one of our doctors.

496
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,130
Dr. Shaun Murphy saved this boy?

497
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,800
The boy is in O.R. 2.

498
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,480
Dr. Melendez isn't sure if he's going to make it.

499
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,470
Your fianc¨¦ sure can handle a knife.

500
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,280
Why did you warn me about respecting Dr. Andrews?

501
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,660
What's going on?

502
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,880
I'm not gonna always be here to protect you.

503
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,120
You think you're gonna lose?

504
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,500
Everybody loses...

505
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,080
eventually.

506
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,720
Is that your guy?

508
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,220
Can we get a TV?

509
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,750
No.

510
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,450
Why not?

511
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,730
Because we're poor, dude.

512
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,970
We live in a bus.

513
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,800
Do you think Mom is looking for us?

514
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,600
Nope.

515
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,470
She loves us, but she knows it's better this way.

516
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,000
I got you a present.

517
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,850
It's not my birthday.

518
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,980
I got you a present anyway.

519
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,750
Here.

520
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,170
Kelly.

521
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,230
Dr. Browne...

522
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,120
You were right.

523
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,130
- I don't like pickles. - ?I know.

524
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,670
- I don't want pickles. - And I checked.

525
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,700
You saved that boy's life.

526
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,190
Oh, good.

527
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,390
His name is Adam.

528
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,990
Traumatic pneumothorax.

529
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,220
I'm hungry.

530
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,700
Board reconvenes in 45 minutes.

531
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,110
Can you stay here until I get back?

532
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,030
Okay.

533
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,720
Okay.

534
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,480
He's got a serious deficit.

535
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,810
A child is alive today because of that deficit.

536
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,780
And tomorrow, one may be dead because of it.

537
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,930
I seem to remember that when I hired you,

538
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,500
you weren't exactly making the most adult decisions.

539
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,200
You haven't killed anyone yet. Have you?

540
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,760
Well, thankfully, there's a cure for youth and stupidity --

541
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,330
time and experience.

542
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,100
There's a cure for stupidity?

543
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,000
Okay.

544
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,850
That would be a windfall.

545
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,990
All Shaun has is a diagnosis.

546
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,190
I'd like your help.

547
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,600
I take it I'm not gonna get it.

548
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,160
Okay.

549
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:41,990
Wait.

550
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,790
What's the story with this kid?

551
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,550
Why is it so important to you?

552
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,120
Why not?

553
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,530
Because letting things get personal is a sure formula

554
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,940
for screwing things up.

555
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,610
I don't know.

556
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,280
Letting things get personal is how we...

557
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,660
...how we make it matter.

558
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,080
So, are you proud or disappointed?

559
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,900
Do I have to pick just one?

560
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,950
You're new to town, right?

561
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,570
Yes.

562
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,680
Well, I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

563
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,800
No.

564
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,660
You got to be curious about the place, about the people.

565
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,130
Dr. Glassman gave me a map of the hospital,

566
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,580
and I got a map of San Jose online.

567
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,990
Okay.

568
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:53,960
Great.

569
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,030
I do have one question.

570
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,030
Yeah?

571
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,970
Why were you rude to me when we first met,

572
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,740
then nicer to me the second time we met,

573
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,590
and now you want to be my friend?

574
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,190
Which time was it that you were pretending?

575
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,440
Shaun. We're ready.

576
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,990
The vote was clear. Why are we reopening this?

577
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,930
Is it really because of a piece of publicity?

578
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,230
It's because the man just saved somebody's life.

579
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,210
And thank God for that,

580
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,150
but it doesn't change a single thing we discussed.

581
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,510
Give him six months.

582
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,930
If he proves anything less than excellent --

583
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,460
Someone "less than excellent" means someone else dies.

584
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,140
Well, I-I would love to make you happy, Doctor.

585
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,440
I would love to hire someone who never, ever makes a mistake.

586
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,460
Unfortunately, God already has a job.

587
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,770
I can accept that he will have insights

588
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,500
that none of the rest of us will have.

589
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,480
Can you accept that he will make mistakes

590
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,610
none of the rest of us will make?

591
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,410
You won't be the one who pays the price.

592
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,720
If Shaun doesn't live up to everything I know he can do,

593
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,050
he will be immediately released.

594
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:20,720
And I will resign my position as President of this hospital.

595
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,020
We haven't heard from Dr. Murphy yet.

596
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,790
Perhaps we should hear from him before we decide his fate.

597
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,240
Shaun...

598
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,050
Dr. Murphy...

599
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,540
I'd like you to tell us why you want to become a surgeon.

600
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,070
Why do I want them to be my friends?

601
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,910
Everybody needs friends, Shaun.

602
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,470
It's gonna be cool, okay? Play hide and seek maybe?

603
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,720
- Okay. - ?Tag in the warehouse?

604
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,810
Hey, stop following me.

605
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,070
Told ya it was fun, right?

606
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,630
Hey, you know what?

607
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,860
The day that the rain smelled like ice cream,

608
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:01,390
my bunny went to heaven in front of my eyes.

609
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,940
The day that the copper pipes in the old building 

610
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,640
smelled like burnt food, 

611
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,210
my brother...

612
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,870
went to heaven in front of my eyes.

613
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,920
I couldn't save them.

614
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,520
It's sad.

615
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,520
Neither one had the chance to become an adult.

616
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,020
They should have become adults.

617
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,570
They should have had children of their own

618
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,970
and loved those children.

619
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,150
And I want to make that possible

620
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,480
for other people.

621
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,280
And I want to make a lot of money so that I can have a television.

622
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,270
Dr. Murphy...

623
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,960
I want to be the first to welcome you to

624
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,480
San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.

625
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,100
We're very proud to have you.

626
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,110
Shaun, Dr. Melendez's team is going into surgery.

627
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,890
I mean, if you're interested.

628
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,480
Got a messy field here.

629
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,580
Murphy.

630
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,400
Suction.

631
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,320
Never forget, you're the smart one.

632
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,100
You can do anything.

633
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,550
And I'm proud of you, Shaun.

634
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,520
Bet you've seen many of these.

635
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,070
I remember my first.

636
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,470
Kept thinking, "It doesn't get any better than this."

637
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,310
And for you, I'm afraid, that's literally true.

638
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,310
You're a nice kid, and you're obviously very smart,

639
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,360
but you don't belong here.

640
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,860
So, as long as you're part of my team,

641
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,200
this is all you're ever going to be doing -- suction.

642
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,760
I saw a lot of surgeons in medical school.

643
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,420
You're much better than them.

644
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,390
I have a lot to learn from you.

645
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,410
You're very arrogant.

646
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,170
Do you think that helps you be a good surgeon?

647
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,530
Does it hurt you as a person?

648
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,080
Is it worth it?
