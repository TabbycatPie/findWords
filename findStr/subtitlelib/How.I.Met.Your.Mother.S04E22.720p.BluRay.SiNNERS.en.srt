1
00:00:02,278 --> 00:00:04,473
<i>In May of 2009,
I was on the verge of scoring</i>

2
00:00:04,581 --> 00:00:07,414
<i>my first big client
as an independent architect.</i>

3
00:00:07,517 --> 00:00:09,850
<i>I was willing to do anything
to make it happen.</i>

4
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:12,821
Here's what we want, son. It's real simple.

5
00:00:12,923 --> 00:00:15,357
We're opening a restaurant
called Rib Town,

6
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:17,552
and we want it to be shaped

7
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:19,356
like a cowboy hat.

8
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:21,458
<i>Anything.</i>

9
00:00:21,566 --> 00:00:23,056
A cowboy hat?

10
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:26,130
That's brilliant. I love it!

11
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:29,730
I mean, nothing says delicious
like the inside of a cowboy hat, right?

12
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:32,333
Look, I'm telling you, I'm your guy. I...

13
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:36,906
I think I was born to design this building.
I just...

14
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,508
I see it.

15
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:41,587
I don't see it. I don't see it. I don't see it.

16
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:42,712
Hey.

17
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,222
What's so good about it?

18
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:45,722
Uh-oh. Up all night?

19
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:47,987
I told these guys
I have a vision for this thing.

20
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,461
They want to see a pitch in a week,
and I got nothing.

21
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:52,656
- Oh, it's cute.
- Cute?

22
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,028
- Yeah.
- Robin,

23
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:57,161
I could be designing
concert halls and bridges.

24
00:00:57,272 --> 00:01:00,332
Bridges so beautiful
they could be in museums.

25
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:03,205
And I could design those museums.

26
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:06,372
But what am I designing instead?
What has my career come to?

27
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:10,418
A two-story Stetson
with outdoor dining on the brim.

28
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:15,380
It's a sick cosmic joke.
The universe is conspiring against me.

29
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:19,256
Oh, you just need to get out of the house.
Take a walk. Get a bagel.

30
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:21,956
Yeah. Yeah, that'll solve everything.

31
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:24,966
I haven't slept for 34 hours,
but a bagel is the answer.

32
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:28,333
A cinnamon-raisin bagel
with a little cream cheese.

33
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,569
Actually, that sounds pretty good.
I'm going to get a bagel.

34
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:35,112
Bring an umbrella. It's supposed to rain,
according to Galoshes, our weather clown.

35
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:37,544
Your show has a clown
who does the weather?

36
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:39,707
- That's a little cheesy, don't you think?
- Yeah.

37
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:43,777
And what's that restaurant
you're designing shaped like, Hoss?

38
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,457
Fine. You want me out of the house,
I'll get out of the house.

39
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,548
Uh-huh.

40
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,757
Can't wait to see what the universe
has lined up for me out there.

41
00:01:56,936 --> 00:02:00,099
<i>Kids, I've been telling you
the story of how I met your mother.</i>

42
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:02,504
<i>And while there's many things
to learn from this story,</i>

43
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,578
<i>this may be the biggest.</i>

44
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:08,136
<i>The great moments of your life
won't necessarily be the things you do.</i>

45
00:02:08,248 --> 00:02:10,910
<i>They'll also be the things
that happen to you.</i>

46
00:02:11,018 --> 00:02:14,647
<i>No, I'm not saying you can't take action
to affect the outcome of your life.</i>

47
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:17,486
<i>You have to take action, and you will.</i>

48
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,386
<i>But never forget that, on any day,</i>

49
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:24,795
<i>you could step out the front door
and your whole life can change forever.</i>

50
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:29,462
<i>You see, the universe has a plan, kids,
and that plan is always in motion.</i>

51
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:31,863
<i>A butterfly flaps its wings,</i>

52
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:35,402
<i>and it starts to rain.</i>

53
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:38,606
<i>It's a scary thought,
but it's also kind of wonderful.</i>

54
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:41,741
<i>All these little parts of the machine
constantly working,</i>

55
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:44,412
<i>making sure that you end up
exactly where you're supposed to be,</i>

56
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:47,115
<i>exactly when you're supposed
to be there.</i>

57
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:50,319
<i>The right place at the right time.</i>

58
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,874
<i>Kids, it's a miracle
that I ended up on that street corner,</i>

59
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:13,612
<i>especially when you consider how easy
it would have been not to end up there.</i>

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,984
<i>I mean, for instance, when I first
stepped out of the apartment,</i>

61
00:03:16,089 --> 00:03:18,114
<i>I almost went right instead of left.</i>

62
00:03:18,224 --> 00:03:19,486
<i>Why didn't I go right?</i>

63
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,719
<i>Well, to answer that,
we have to go back a few days.</i>

64
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:25,290
<i>As you know, back then,
your Aunt Robin hosted a morning show.</i>

65
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:28,766
Now Eunice here
makes all of these purses herself.

66
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:31,497
They are hand-embroidered
with the world's finest silk.

67
00:03:31,605 --> 00:03:33,971
And each one takes months to make.

68
00:03:34,075 --> 00:03:37,534
I cannot emphasize
how much work goes into...

69
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,307
Go to weather, you idiot.

70
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,114
Hey, everybody.

71
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:48,952
We got a high-pressure system
coming in from the west and...

72
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:55,059
On the plus side,
I bought the cutest purse today.

73
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:57,461
So, wait, why did you throw up?

74
00:03:57,667 --> 00:04:00,193
- You don't want to know.
- Come on. Tell me.

75
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:03,372
I'm pregnant.

76
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:06,136
I will raise this child with you.
You are not alone in this.

77
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:09,041
We can even get married if you want,
but I'd still want to see other girls,

78
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:10,408
so it'd have to be
one of those kinds of marriages.

79
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:11,880
God, stop it.

80
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:15,475
I'm not pregnant. It's food poisoning. God!

81
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,013
I ate something from this place,

82
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:21,957
and three hours later,
I was spewing like an open hydrant.

83
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,326
- God. From where?
- Well, that's a gross question.

84
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,331
No, where was the food from?

85
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,525
Oh.

86
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:30,601
- I don't want to tell you.
- What?

87
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,730
Ted, Ted! Go to YouTube. Put in
"Robin Scherbatsky, morning show, vomit. "

88
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,899
Oh, hey, Robin. Home so soon?

89
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,007
- Someone already put it on YouTube?
- Yeah. Someone.

90
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,416
So, why you been throwing up?
You pregnant?

91
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,783
Yeah, Barney. I'm pregnant.

92
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,389
So, wait, why won't you tell me
where you got food poisoning?

93
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:57,363
You love this place.
If I tell you, it'll just ruin it.

94
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:00,299
- Okay. That makes sense.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:01,869
Don't tell me.

96
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:04,564
Is it that Indian place
where the cat jumps on all the tables?

97
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:06,607
- I'm not saying.
- That Spanish place with the baby's crib

98
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,200
- in the middle of the restaurant?
- I'm not saying.

99
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:12,743
God, no. No, no, no.

100
00:05:13,383 --> 00:05:15,578
Is it this place? Tell me, damn you!

101
00:05:15,685 --> 00:05:18,415
- Fine, you really want to know?
- Yes!

102
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:20,547
- It's Schlegel's Bagels.
- No!

103
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:22,819
Why did you tell me that?

104
00:05:22,927 --> 00:05:25,691
Schlegel's? Thanks a lot, Robin.

105
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:28,288
Now I'm gonna have to try
to find another place in New York

106
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,162
that serves bagels.

107
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:35,165
<i>So, you see, kids, if I had gone
to Schlegel's Bagels, as usual,</i>

108
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:36,331
<i>I would have taken a right.</i>

109
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,305
<i>I would have gotten a bagel,</i>

110
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:41,902
<i>gone home,
worked on the old hat building,</i>

111
00:05:42,013 --> 00:05:44,107
and you kids might never have been born.

112
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:48,949
<i>But I turned left instead, to go
to my second-favorite bagel place,</i>

113
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:50,886
<i>and the rest is history.</i>

114
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,084
<i>Of course, I stopped
at that magazine stand on the way.</i>

115
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:56,628
<i>Why did I stop there? Here's why.</i>

116
00:05:57,431 --> 00:05:58,591
Yes.

117
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:01,023
Yes!

118
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:04,263
<i>Bro's Life magazine.</i>

119
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:07,100
Page 83. Check it.

120
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:11,407
"What your paintball gun says
about your personality. "

121
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:12,774
Below that.

122
00:06:12,881 --> 00:06:15,611
"That last five pounds.
How to get her to lose them. "

123
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:17,150
Above that.

124
00:06:17,653 --> 00:06:19,120
"Petra Petrova. "

125
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:21,212
Petra Petrova.

126
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:25,384
<i>Bro's Life magazine's
Girl of the Year for May.</i>

127
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:29,898
A delicate flower in stiletto pumps
and leopard panties, straddling an ATV.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,194
These magazines are so lame.

129
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:32,996
I mean, she's probably
airbrushed and enhanced.

130
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:36,266
- I have a date with her.
- You are my hero! Are you serious?

131
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,864
- How do you have a date with her?
- Not part of the story.

132
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:42,275
Ted, I have been waiting
a long time to say this.

133
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,007
This girl is the one.

134
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:47,346
Of course, she's the one.
You have to marry those.

135
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:48,543
Her.

136
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,644
Marry?

137
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,054
No. I have something much,
much more special in mind.

138
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:58,992
Petra here, if all goes well,

139
00:06:59,097 --> 00:07:01,361
will be my... Wait for it... 200th.

140
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:03,400
Sorry, I couldn't wait. It's all too exciting.

141
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:06,301
Your 200th, as in "sex with"?

142
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:10,843
As in "sex with. "
I request the highest of fives.

143
00:07:11,444 --> 00:07:13,969
Not if I was wearing a HazMat suit.

144
00:07:14,847 --> 00:07:16,509
Two hundred is too many.

145
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:20,348
Oh. Right, 'cause there can be
too many of something wonderful.

146
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:24,322
"Hey, Babe Ruth, easy, big fella.
Let's not hit too many homers. "

147
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:28,260
<i>"Hey, Steve Guttenberg, maybe just make
three Police Academy movies.</i>

148
00:07:28,363 --> 00:07:30,092
"America's laughed enough. "

149
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:31,927
Who are these girls?

150
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:33,728
That was rhetorical.
Don't show me the list.

151
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:37,362
A hundred and ninety-nine
satisfied customers.

152
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:39,805
Anyway, the big night is Thursday.

153
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,345
I'm having a celebratory soirée
beforehand at MacLaren's.

154
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:46,506
Prepare a toast.
Black tie optional, but preferred.

155
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,675
Gifts are, look, I would say unnecessary,
but follow your heart.

156
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,611
Barney, 200's too many.

157
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,451
- It's not too many.
- It's too many!

158
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,758
- It's not too many.
- Thank you.

159
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,087
No, don't get me wrong.

160
00:07:57,194 --> 00:08:01,062
You're disgusting, and the cops should
probably clamp a boot on your genitals,

161
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,224
but that number should be higher.

162
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:07,668
After Barney told me about all this,
I crunched the numbers and, well,

163
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:09,034
I had some charts made up.

164
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:13,408
Barney here hits on
roughly 20 girls a week.

165
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:18,472
Whoa! It's way more than 20.
And B. Smooth don't do nothing roughly.

166
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:23,647
Let's say 20. So, 20 girls a week
means 1,040 girls a year.

167
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:26,555
In Barney's 16 years of sexual activity,

168
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,925
that means he's hit on 16,640 girls.

169
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:33,727
Now, if he's bedded 199 of them,

170
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:37,326
that's a success rate of

171
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:40,839
a little over one percent.

172
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,670
That's a batting average of 12,

173
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:46,747
eight times worse than
the career batting average

174
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,911
of one-handed pitcher,
that's right, pitcher, Jim Abbott.

175
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,288
Jealous. Jealous.

176
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:58,723
Hero.

177
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,659
Suspiciously quiet
during this conversation

178
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:02,663
about number of sex partners.

179
00:09:02,765 --> 00:09:03,857
Hero.

180
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:06,696
It's the grand total.
That's the only number that matters.

181
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:09,499
- Says who?
- Matthew Panning,

182
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:12,268
the stud of Port Richmond Middle School.

183
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:16,840
Stinson, you're such a dweeb-o.
I bet you never even done it with a girl.

184
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,380
Neither have you.

185
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,746
How many times do I have to explain this?

186
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,376
I've done it with 100 girls.

187
00:09:22,487 --> 00:09:25,285
They're seventh graders
at my cousin's school on Long Island.

188
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,723
Well, you know what, Matthew?
Someday, I'm gonna do it with 200.

189
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:32,896
Yeah. Call me when that happens.

190
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:36,192
And call him I will.

191
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:39,663
I think he's gonna say it again really slow.

192
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:41,967
Call him

193
00:09:42,975 --> 00:09:44,499
I will.

194
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:49,581
Hey, you listed Gaby Allan twice,
as 78 and 162.

195
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:51,583
What? Let me see.

196
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:54,654
Seven... One... Oh, my God.

197
00:09:55,689 --> 00:10:00,320
Wait I... I counted the same girl twice?
That means I'm only at 198?

198
00:10:00,428 --> 00:10:04,592
Well, that only means that you're half
a percent less gross than we thought.

199
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:07,532
I'm seducing a Czech supermodel
in two hours.

200
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:10,196
I can't squander that on 199.

201
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,033
Petra has to be 200.

202
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Well, what are you gonna do?

203
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,744
I mean, it's not like
you're gonna find someone new

204
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:19,006
to have sex with in the next two hours.

205
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:20,675
Hi, Barney Stinson, millionaire astronaut.

206
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,410
Wanna come back to my place
and see some moon shells?

207
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,543
Go away.

208
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:26,645
I just got back from my wife's grave.
Put her in the ground a year ago today.

209
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,621
Man, I miss her.
I sure could use some comfort.

210
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:29,714
You're creepy.

211
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,855
Man, aren't you sick of all the games?
I just want to settle down

212
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:35,158
and have a gaggle of rug rats,
like, right now.

213
00:10:35,266 --> 00:10:37,894
I have Mace, and I enjoy using it.

214
00:10:40,704 --> 00:10:41,762
Marshall.

215
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:44,842
Knowing how important this is to me,
do you think Lily would even consider...

216
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:47,343
- And by the way, I would do all the work...
- I will end your life.

217
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:48,673
Right.

218
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,319
Where'd Barney go? It's been over an hour.

219
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,482
You know,
looking over the names on this list,

220
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,186
I'm not sensing a lot of ethnic diversity.

221
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,422
He should really look at that in himself.

222
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,297
Okay. All done.

223
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,164
One hundred and ninety-nine down,
one more to go.

224
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,569
Hey, you done with your drink?

225
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:17,104
There's the stuff.

226
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,443
What the hell happened to you?

227
00:11:20,548 --> 00:11:24,006
So, there's this girl at my gym, Pauline.

228
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:25,745
She's been after me for some time.

229
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,754
- Why'd you wait until now?
- She's not exactly my type.

230
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:31,417
Looking good, Pauline.

231
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:32,653
You are gonna rip it up

232
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:36,492
at the Women's Pumping Iron Classic
in Sarasota this fall.

233
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:44,705
So, I was thinking about you and me,

234
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:48,077
and if you're still interested...

235
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:52,374
- Okay, blondie, time for Mama's cardio.
- Sweet Mommy!

236
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:56,742
Every inch of her
tasted like roast beef and creatine.

237
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:00,323
But I did it.

238
00:12:00,424 --> 00:12:03,723
I did it, and I still have 30 minutes
before I'm supposed to meet Petra.

239
00:12:03,828 --> 00:12:05,319
Robin, do you have any concealer handy?

240
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,490
I'd really like to cover up
some bruises and razor burn.

241
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,693
Barney,

242
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:13,862
- I hate to break this to you, but...
- What?

243
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:17,333
Well, you did count Gaby Allan twice,

244
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:21,402
but you also went from 138 to 138.

245
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:23,481
You used the same number twice.

246
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,312
Wait, so that means

247
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:28,047
Pauline wasn't 199, Pauline was 200?

248
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:29,613
Congratulations!

249
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:35,124
No! Hey, that was supposed to be Petra!
Petra was supposed to be 200!

250
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:38,525
Gorgeous, feminine,
doesn't-wear-a-weight-belt-in-bed Petra!

251
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:41,625
- Hey, come on. You made it to 200.
Yeah.

252
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:43,135
You should be proud.

253
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:46,501
You should be tested,
but you should be proud.

254
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:49,839
Who cares if Pauline doesn't pose
for bikini pictures in magazines?

255
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:51,105
Actually, she does.

256
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:54,182
<i>She's gonna be in next week's issue
of Muscle Sexxy.</i>

257
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:56,547
And, like many of the ladies
in that magazine,

258
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:58,882
"Sexxy" has two X's and one Y.

259
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:03,489
<i>And so,
on my way to get a bagel,</i>

260
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:08,326
<i>I stopped at a newsstand for a full minute
to check out a picture of Barney's 200th.</i>

261
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:09,626
Barney!

262
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:12,827
<i>If I hadn't done that,
I would've walked right by the newsstand,</i>

263
00:13:12,936 --> 00:13:16,304
<i>cut down 77th
and gotten to that corner a minute early.</i>

264
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:19,001
<i>I would've gotten the bagel,
done some work,</i>

265
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,578
and you kids might never have been born.

266
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,116
<i>Now, why did I cut down 77th
and give a dollar to the homeless guy?</i>

267
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:26,343
<i>Here's why.</i>

268
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:29,216
<i>Back when Marshall first started working
at Goliath National Bank...</i>

269
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,116
Hi.

270
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:34,522
Fran, I don't mean to bother you,
but I have a big presentation tomorrow,

271
00:13:34,626 --> 00:13:38,222
and it would really help if I could get,
like, some charts and graphs made up.

272
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:41,300
- Could you help me with that?
- Honey, this is the graphics department.

273
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:44,029
We can make as many graphs,
as many charts, in as many colors,

274
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,866
on as many kinds of paper as you want.

275
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,035
Oh, Fran.

276
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,040
Oh, Franny, Franny, Fran.

277
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,877
We are gonna have some fun.

278
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:59,082
I ranked the presidents
in order of how dirty their names sound.

279
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:00,745
One, Johnson.

280
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:02,713
Two, Bush.

281
00:14:03,158 --> 00:14:04,819
Three, Harding.

282
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,484
Four, Polk.

283
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,727
This circle represents
"People Who Are Breaking My Heart,"

284
00:14:12,402 --> 00:14:14,529
and this circle represents

285
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,606
"People Who Are Shaking
My Confidence Daily. "

286
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:20,142
And where they overlap,

287
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,105
Cecilia.

288
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,576
This is a pie chart
describing my favorite bars.

289
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:34,119
And this is a bar graph
describing my favorite pies.

290
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:42,455
What's going on?

291
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:45,560
- Enough with the charts.
- And the graphs.

292
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:48,538
Really, any visual representation of data.

293
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:52,202
I'm not an idiot. Okay?

294
00:14:53,245 --> 00:14:56,737
I know how you guys feel
about my charts and my graphs.

295
00:14:56,849 --> 00:14:59,546
As a matter of fact, I've made a chart
of your reaction to my charts.

296
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:02,315
Let's take a look. Yes, it is true.

297
00:15:02,422 --> 00:15:06,290
Since Cecilia, your interest in my charts
has been steadily dropping.

298
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:10,524
But, based on recent trends,
I have also made

299
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:12,496
a projection chart!

300
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,296
And look, huge spike in interest coming!

301
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:17,735
And this isn't just some dead cat bounce.

302
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,139
This is big, sustainable growth
over the long term.

303
00:15:21,243 --> 00:15:23,677
You're a big, sustainable growth.

304
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:29,415
Okay. So, I have prepared a few charts

305
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:33,182
to demonstrate how setting up
a shell corporation in Bermuda

306
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:35,780
could help minimize
our second-quarter losses

307
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,723
and save you all some jail time.

308
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:41,993
To begin with...

309
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,761
Could you just please excuse me?

310
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:56,303
- Mosbius Designs.
- What the hell happened to my charts?

311
00:15:56,414 --> 00:15:58,541
- We threw them away.
- What?

312
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,242
That's how an intervention
works, Marshall.

313
00:16:00,352 --> 00:16:02,843
You wouldn't stop using,
so we flushed your stash.

314
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,688
Come on, Ted! I need my charts, man!

315
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:08,385
Just for today, and then I promise
I will never ever use charts again.

316
00:16:08,494 --> 00:16:11,088
I'm under a lot of pressure here.
I need my charts, Jack!

317
00:16:11,797 --> 00:16:13,856
My God, you're doing charts at work?

318
00:16:14,367 --> 00:16:17,734
They're for work, you idiot!
I'm giving a big presentation right now,

319
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:19,601
and if I don't have those charts,
I'm gonna get fired!

320
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:23,604
Oh, crap. Okay, stay right there.
I'll bring them to you.

321
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,372
Hurry up!
I'll try to think of a way to stall them.

322
00:16:27,347 --> 00:16:29,578
Hi. Okay.

323
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,709
I'm sorry, but there's been
a little delay with the charts.

324
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,913
But we will get started in just a minute.

325
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:42,992
Fish are weird, right?

326
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:45,930
I mean, what's up with fish?

327
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:54,376
Charts! Get your charts here!

328
00:16:56,246 --> 00:17:00,444
Oh! Excuse me, Milt.
I think those are my charts.

329
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:02,243
- These charts?
- Yeah.

330
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,580
On my blanket?

331
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,321
That's also my blanket.
We'll get to that later.

332
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:10,019
- But I really need these charts.
- Oh good, 'cause they're for sale.

333
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:11,719
Fine, how much?

334
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,594
One million dollars.

335
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,797
- I'll give you five bucks.
- A million dollars.

336
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,963
No one's gonna pay
a million dollars for these charts.

337
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,971
One million dollars.

338
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,975
Okay, Milt, you win.

339
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,204
I'm gonna give you one million dollars.

340
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,607
Urinating...

341
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,412
The problem is, the ATM...

342
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,349
The alien time machine.

343
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,912
The alien time machine
has a withdrawal limit.

344
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:42,428
So, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you one dollar a day,

345
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,726
for a million days.

346
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,130
That's...

347
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:49,967
- That's 2,700 years.
- Yeah.

348
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:51,967
Deal!

349
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,201
Okay.

350
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,171
Sucker.

351
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:59,944
I'm sorry, is there a land bass
I don't know about?

352
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,020
Let's get started.

353
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:07,783
<i>And so, if I hadn't
bought those charts back for Marshall,</i>

354
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,155
<i>I wouldn't have had to cut down 77th
to give Milt his daily dollar</i>

355
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,693
<i>and, well, you know the rest.</i>

356
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:13,785
Thank you.

357
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:15,364
<i>So, there you have it, kids.</i>

358
00:18:15,465 --> 00:18:18,593
<i>There's a lot of little reasons
why the big things in our lives happen.</i>

359
00:18:18,702 --> 00:18:21,296
<i>If I had known then where
all those little things were leading me,</i>

360
00:18:21,405 --> 00:18:23,532
<i>and how grateful I'd be to get there,</i>

361
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,872
<i>well, I probably would've done something</i>

362
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:27,967
<i>like this.</i>

363
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,446
<i>Hey, hey, glad girls
only want to get you high</i>

364
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:40,889
<i>Hey, hey, glad girls
only want to get you high</i>

365
00:18:42,494 --> 00:18:48,263
<i>Hey, hey, glad girls
only want to get you high</i>

366
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,531
<i>And they're all right
And they're all right</i>

367
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:57,804
<i>And they're all right
And they're all right</i>

368
00:18:57,911 --> 00:19:02,815
<i>Glad girls only want to get you high</i>

369
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:07,385
<i>And they're all right
And they're all right</i>

370
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:11,289
<i>Because, somehow, I ended up
in the right place at the right time.</i>

371
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:14,851
<i>And, as a result,
my life would never be the same.</i>

372
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:33,916
<i>The next day, Uncle Barney
finally confronted Matthew Panning,</i>

373
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,008
<i>the stud of Port Richmond Middle School.</i>

374
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,918
So, Barney, great to hear from you
after all this time.

375
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:42,458
- What's been going on?
- I've had sex with 200 women.

376
00:19:44,094 --> 00:19:47,223
Oh God! That's way too many.

377
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:49,527
I mean, that's just gross.

378
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,363
Have you sought counseling
for sex addiction?

379
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:52,959
Because you're a prime candidate.

380
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:56,006
Have you sought counseling
for I win-you lose?

381
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:59,475
Yeah, suddenly those 100 girls
you nailed in the seventh grade

382
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:01,205
aren't so impressive.

383
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:03,941
A hundred girls?
Is that what this is about?

384
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,916
- Barney, I lied.
- Sure you did.

385
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,648
I was 12. Of course I was lying.

386
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:11,781
I didn't have a pet Ewok, either.

387
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:13,120
Sure you didn't.

388
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:16,490
Your whole adult life has been built around

389
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:19,190
something I lied about when I was 12?

390
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,294
Jealous?

391
00:20:21,402 --> 00:20:24,166
Look, I gotta go pick my kids up at school.

392
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,740
It sounds like you got a lot of problems.

393
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:28,365
Good luck, I guess.

394
00:20:30,611 --> 00:20:32,079
I'm awesome.

395
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,942
Okay, 200.

396
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:38,917
Now what?
