这孩子特别喜欢那披风
Kid loves that cape.

37
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,330
看来你不那么介意儿子穿其他服装配饰了
So, I see your stance on sons wearing accessories has evolved.

38
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,250
那件披风赋予他超能力
The cape gives him superpowers.

39
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,150
你当年穿的暖腿袜赋予你什么了
What did leg warmers give you?

时髦值  它们让我时髦值大增
Flair. They gave me flair.

抱歉  我只是需要独自放松一晚

为莉莉大采购垒球用品
hauling Lily all over for softball,

51
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,190
还要假装对垒球感兴趣
pretending to care about softball.

52
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,820
我懂想要独自放松一下的感觉
Oh, I get needing time away.

53
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,080
和你妈结婚那些年让我深有体会
I was married to your mother.

54
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,040
就像你现在这样
Like you are now.

55
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,610
我全都计划好了
I have it all planned out.

56
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,950
我开车到沙漠那边去
I drive to the desert.

57
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,390
入住万锦酒店
I check into the Markham --

58
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,540
在泳池边休息几小时  做个按摩
a few hours by the pool, massage,

59
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,020
然后下楼去吃多汁的牛排与薯条
then I head downstairs for a juicy steak frites,

60
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,330
随身只带一本书  书不会开口烦我
just me and my book, which can't talk to me.

61
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,310
那就去
So do it.

62
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,610
问小卡我能不能自己出门
Asking Cam to go away alone

63
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,420
会让他感情受伤发疯三周
is three weeks of wounded crazy

64
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,270
我现在真的没有心力去面对他那样
that I -- I don't want to deal with right now.

65
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,610
别问  直接说
Don't ask, tell.

66
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,460
{\an8}不问  不说是美军早年对军中同性恋者的政策

67
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,460
这不是你们基佬一直在争取的权益吗
Isn't that what you fought for?

68
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,580
你这话让我不知道该从哪里开始纠正
Okay, I don't know what to address first.

69
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,290
杰  歌洛莉亚准备好回家了
Uh, Jay, Gloria's ready to go.

也祝你今天愉快  塔克太太
You have a good one, too... Mrs. Tucker.

72
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,830
他为什么叫你塔克太太
Why'd he call you Mrs. Tucker?

73
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,730
他又为什么穿那么没线条的牛仔裤  谁知道
Why does he wear those boxy jeans? I don't know.

74
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,710
不  说真的  他为什么又在吐槽你
No, seriously. W-Why is he messing with you?

75
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,360
好吧  说就说
All right, yeah, what the hell.

76
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,190
我告诉他我很想
Um, I told him how I would love to go

77
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,470
去沙漠里放松一晚
to the desert for a night.

78
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,680
好啊  多有趣  我们去吧
Okay, yeah. Fun. Let's go!

79
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,400
请等一下
Hold, please.

80
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,530
我说我很想自己去沙漠里放松一晚
How I would love to go to the desert for a night alone.

81
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,800
我不在乎
I don't care.

82
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,270
如果你想自己去就自己去吧  我不在乎
If you want to go alone, go alone. I don't care.

83
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,870
瞧  你说了两次"我不在乎"
Oh, see, you said "I don't care" twice.

84
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,640
因为我就是那么不在乎
Because that's how much I don't care.

85
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,830
你怎么还不走
Why are you still here?

86
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,320
小卡  别受伤  我不是在逃离你
Cam, don't be hurt. I'm not running from you.

87
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,680
-拿着  -我才不要叠床单
- Here. - And I'm not folding that.

88
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,450
我只是想自己放松一晚  好吗
I just wanted a night alone, okay?

89
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,040
莉莉今晚要去朋友家过夜
Lily's going to that sleepover tonight.

90
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,390
我觉得今晚去正合适
It seemed like a good night to do it.

91
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,340
那就去啊
So, go!

92
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,860
我不喜欢你这像在暗示
You know, I don't love the implication

93
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,640
我缠人到不能自己过一晚的话
that I'm so needy I can't spend one night by myself.

94
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,730
我没那么说
I didn't say that.

95
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,260
你也没没那么说
You didn't not say that.

96
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,620
你也没不缠人
And you're not not being needy.

97
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,470
为了向你展示我有多不缠人
Well, to show you how not needy I am,

98
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,040
我亲自帮你打包
I... will pack your bag for you.

99
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,650
你已经打包好了吗
It's already packed?

100
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,970
是的  这已经是我第三次
Oh, yeah, well, this is the third time

101
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,010
试着问你行不行了
I've tried asking you.

102
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,950
再见  我爱你  就这样
Bye. I love you. Okay.

爸爸知道
Papa knows.

110
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,210
没错
That's right.

111
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,770
我如此了解我妻子  我能在她开口前
I know my wife so well, I was able to anticipate

112
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,990
就预测到她想问什么
her questions before she asked them.

113
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,690
这有点意思
Well, this is kind of fun.

114
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,340
全世界最性感吗
The sexiest?

115
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,870
我也不确定  毕竟人外有人天外有天
I don't know. The world's a pretty big place.

116
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,530
帮你自己倒杯葡萄酒  我的爱人
Help yourself to a glass of wine, my love.

117
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,960
现在时间还有点早
Oh, it's kind of early in the day,

118
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,630
但我们能有几次过二人时光的机会啊
but how often do we get the house completely to ourselves?

119
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,200
悠着点  小酒鬼
Easy, thirsty!

120
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,900
我还有好多计划等着你
I've got plans for you.

121
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,800
小提示  除了这块投影布
Hint -- This won't be the last time

122
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,780
今天你还会在床单布上看到我的肉体

看来我们得延后享用你做的精美午餐了
Well, I guess your beautiful lunch will have to wait.

125
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,320

没错  克莱尔  让我看看你的美脚
Yes, Claire. Show me those pretty feet.

128
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,850
这玩意怎么关
How do you turn this thing off?

129
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,530
投影布让我接着脱
The sheet said yes.

130
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,220
你们知道什么对学习毫无益处吗
You know what's not real conducive to studying?

131

上百个来自亚洲各国的书呆子的哭号

咱家有玉米吗
Do we have any corn?

136
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,670
这是什么情况
What is happening?

137
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,650
那些是鸡吗
Are those chickens?

138

史诗级高三恶作剧
Epic senior prank.

139
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,150
别搞得史诗过头  不然你明年怎么超越自己
Don't make it too epic. How will you top it next year?

140
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,080
把它们拎出去  拎出去
Get them out. Get them out.

141
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,530
-快快快  -我得上楼拿点东西

是啊  我不知道他为什么非要加上博士

一点都不奇怪
That's not weird.

159

总之  我只是想
Anyway, I just wanted to pick

160
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,210
来拿走我留在这的东西
something up that I left here.

161
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,310
看

黄色是最难拼的一面
Yellow's the hardest side.

165
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,230
那是什么声音  怎么了
What is that sound? What happened?

166
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,050
我把楼梯栏杆撞坏了  我会修好的
Brooke the banister. I'll fix it!

167
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,470
这是什么东西
What's this thing?

168
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,770
别碰  别碰
No! No!

169

上周吃晚餐时
That was the name of the TV show

182

我想不起来的电视剧名叫《救救我》
I couldn't remember at dinner last week.

183

184
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,680

185
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,980
原来我不是过敏
Turns out, it wasn't the allergies.

186
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,260

我具有马的免疫系统

190
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,050
小时候  我有次需要输血
When I was a kid, I needed a transfusion,

191
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,750
结果给我输错了马血
and there was a mix-up with the vials.

192
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,780
我联系了漫威漫画公司很多次
I've contacted Marvel Comics repeatedly,

193
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,990
但他们好像并不感兴趣
but they don't seem interested.

204
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,700

真的啊  把你的车停进车库

当心别撞到他的杠铃片或电动工具就行了
Just be careful not to hit his weight set or his power tools.

207
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,890

Wow. That would be awesome.

208
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,600
小卡  我知道你是想帮我  但别这么做
Cam, I know you're trying to help, but stop.

209
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,820
我对车子一窍不通
I'm clueless about cars,

210
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,860
而且我真的怕她会撞到我妈的杠铃片
and I really don't want her hitting Mom's weight set.

211
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,350
我会一步步教你的
I'm gonna talk you through it.

212
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,120
好了  美女  不管你在忙什么
Okay, missy, whatever you're working on over here,

213

都让我来帮你吧
let me take over.

214
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,800
不不不  你帮不了

217
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,090
你要吃这个吗
You're gonna eat this?

218
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,290
不是  别犯傻了
No, don't be stupid.

219
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,610
我是打算用块布包着它
I am gonna wrap it in a rag

220
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,820
然后盖在额头上  让它渗进去
and I am gonna let it soak into my head.

221
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,940
好的  要不这样吧
Okay. You know what?

222
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,660
你先到床上躺着  我待会给你送来
Let's get you to bed, and I will bring it to you.

I can follow a recipe. Go on.

224

不不不  这样...
No, no, no. It's --

225
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,470
快去吧
Go on.

226
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,300
小心点
Be careful.

227
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,100
好了  鸡喙粉末
All right. Ground chicken beak.

228
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,350
蟋蟀泥
Mashed crickets.

229

恶心  还有香菜
Ew! Cilantro? Ugh.

230
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,170
我去给您拿门卡  洗手间在那边
I'll grab your room key. Restroom's over there.

231
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:16,990
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

232
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,310
我一路开车来没停过  又喝了一大杯冰茶  所以...
I just drove the whole way. I had a huge iced tea, and --

233
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,210
我干嘛解释  你知道人类为什么要尿尿的
What am I doing? You know why people pee.

234
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,080
科林
Hey, Colin.

235
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,450
我刚才说不需要酒店地图  可能太草率了
Might have been hasty turning down that site map.

236
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,730
我已经误闯进同一个犹太成人礼两次了
I've walked into the same Bar Mitzvah twice now.

237
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,460

238
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,090
我
Me?

239
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,380
你之前说小卡不会让你来的
You said Cam wouldn't let you come.

240
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,250
我还以为会很安全
I thought it was safe.

241
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,170
什么很安全  安全偷走我的特别日吗
Safe to what, steal my special day?

242
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,870
你形容得这么美妙
Well, you made it sound so good!

243
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,070
游泳池  牛排  不用跟人聊天
The pool, the steak, no one to talk to.

244
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,820
现在我们得跟人聊天了
Well, now we have someone to talk to.

245
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,500
"谢谢"你啊
Thanks a lot.

246
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,510
这地方很大
Look, the place is gigantic.

247
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,480
你干你的事  我忙我自己的
You do your thing, I'll do mine.

248
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,070
天啊
Oh, my God.

爸  你抄袭抄到连我在看的书都不放过
Dad, you even stole the book that I'm reading.

250
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,040
你来家里时
When you were over at the house,

251
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,490
-我偷瞄了封面  -当然了
- I peeked at the jacket. - ‭Of course.

我能不看拉里·金推荐说"好到爆"的书吗
I'm not gonna read something Larry King called "Crazy good"?

00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,930
谢谢
Thank you.

256
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,600
你真的不需要酒店地图吗
Uh, you sure you don't need a site map.

257
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,320

你们想害我考试不及格吗
Are you trying to make me fail?!

261
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,680
亲爱的  我知道你压力很大
Sweetheart, I know that you're stressed,

262

而且我们感到很骄傲
and we are so proud

263
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,060
你紧张时不会再拔睫毛  
that you stopped pulling out your eyelashes.

264
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,240
真心骄傲  但我们有点担心 
So proud. We are a little concerned

265
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,160
你把笔塞进鼻子里这种新毛病
about this new, uh, pen-up-the-nose tic.

266
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,930
这  这才不是毛病
It's -- It's not a tic!

267
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,880
只是某些人偶尔会做的事  很正常
It's just something some people do occasionally.

268
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,900
-笔盖去哪儿了  -就在...
- Where is it -- - It's right --

269
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,520
就在  就在鼻孔里塞着呢
It's right -- You got it right there.

270
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:23,730
我靠
Ah! Damn it!

271
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,020
最好笑的是
I mean, the crazy thing is

272
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,360
我很开心迪兰跟那个有仨丑逼孩子的老女人在一起
I'm happy Dylan found that old lady with those hideous kids.

273
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,910
这有多搞笑啊
I mean, how funny is it

274
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,620
他居然先定下来了
that he is the one that settled down

275
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,970
活得那么幸福  而我却基本注定孤独终老
and is doing so great while I'm alone basically forever?

276
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,140
你能不能到别的地方当怨妇
Could you please go be tragic somewhere else?

277
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,140
迪兰  是你回来了吗
Dylan, are you back?

278
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,520

这里简直就是噩梦
This is a nightmare!

280
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,070
你没比我们强好吗
You're not better than us.

281
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,460
我当然比你们强多了
I am so much better than you!

282
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,300
把笔塞进鼻孔的人不是我
I'm not the one with the pen up her nose.

283
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,640
至少我有男友
At least I have a boyfriend.

284
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,000
多恶毒的人才说得出这种话啊
Who says that?

285
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
天啊
Oh, God.

286
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,200
-天啊  -海莉为迪兰伤心哭闹

艾丽克斯为学业崩溃
Alex freaking out about school,

288
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,480
这一切仿佛似曾相识
this is like a big deja vu.

289
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,890
不  似曾相识是指
No, deja vu is when you imagine

290
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,950
好像曾经经历过  其实没有
that you've seen something before.

291
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,530
我们这是"真经历"
This is just vu!

292
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,400
说句马后炮  我应该在把栏杆钉回去前
In hindsight, I should have pulled my head out

293
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,170
先把头缩回来
before I nailed the post back in.

294
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,140
兄弟
Buddy...

经一事长一智
Live and learn.

296
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,070
你要是真的长过智就好了
If only you ever did.

297
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,070
好了
Okay.

298
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,400
我这次好像真的玩太大了
I think I may have gone too deep this time.

299
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,910
要了个亲命啊  好多血啊 
Sweet Caligula, that's a lot of blood.

300
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,800
迪兰为什么要换电话号码
Why would Dylan change his phone number?

301
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,550
你们知道他上次把号码背下来花了多长时间吗
Do you know how long it took him to memorize the last one?!

302
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,780
两边鼻孔都开始流血了吗
Both sides now?

303
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,410
别怪胶水的臭味
Don't hate this glue smell.

304
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,720
现在因为失血  开始头痛了
Now comes the blood-loss migraine.

305
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
这样吧  我去买点药
Oh, you know what? I-I can go get some medicine.

306
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,690
不不  还是我去吧
Oh, no. You know, I can do that.

307
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,180
事实上  我的车挡住了你的
Actually, my car's blocking your car.

308
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,340
那不是大问题  知道为什么吗
Yeah, that's not a big deal. You know why?

309
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,850
因为我可以开你的车  不开自己的  再见
Because I can take your car instead of mine! Bye!

310
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,220
不  不不  不可能
No. No, no, no! No way!

311
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,540
天啊
Oh, my God.

312
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,560
给我闭嘴
Knock it off!

313
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,990
少多管别人闲事
Mind your own business!

314
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,070
我也想
I would love to.

315
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,240
但现在我很好奇  你那些惊呼
But now I'm wondering if all that gasping

316
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,200
是跟我已经看过的内容有关  还是未看到的
is about something I've already read or something coming up!

317
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,620
我看到312页
I'm on page 312.

318
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,670
别告诉我啊
Don't tell me that!

319
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,640
这下我知道20页后会出现令我惊呼的情节了
Now I know there's a gasp coming in 20 pages.

320
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,950
当然了  你在跟踪我
Of course. You're following me.

321
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,010
抱歉  我还以为你是别人
Oh, I-I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.

322
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,360
我刚刚到底目睹了什么可怕之事
What the hell did I just witness?

323
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,740
天啊
Oh, good Lord.

324
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,540
我勒个天啊
Oh! Good Lord!

325
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,050
再跟我介绍一下今日推荐的鲈鱼
Tell me about this sea bass special again.

326
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,300
以地中海风味腌制后用锡纸包着
Mediterranean prep, en papillote --

327
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,800
真的吗
Oh. Really?

328
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,380
是的
Yeah.

329
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,180
锡纸内放入番茄  红椒  刺山柑
Baked in paper with tomato, red pepper,

330
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,750
洋葱和橄榄一起烤
capers, onion, olives.

331
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,550
绝对是我最喜欢的鱼料理
Literally my favorite fish dish.

332
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,470
比起牛排  你会更推荐鲈鱼吗
Would you recommend that over the steak?

333
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,940
我在享受私人时间  你别打扰
Hey, I was kind of in the middle of my own thing here.

334
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,110
比起牛排  你会更推荐鲈鱼吗
Would you recommend it over the steak?

335
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,900
都很美味
They're both great.

336
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,620
好吧  牛排  照计划行事
Fine. Steak. Stick with the plan.

337
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,740
然后我要来一杯梅利维尔红酒
And I'll have a glass of the Merryvale Cab.

338
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,970
我也来一杯  谢谢
Yeah, me too. Thank you.

339
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,770
抱歉  梅利维尔红...  只以瓶贩卖
Sorry, the Merryvale Ca-- uh, doesn't come by the glass.

340
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,390
貌似两位好像互相认识
I-It seems like you two know each other.

341
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,360
你们可以点鱼跟牛排分着吃
You could split the fish and steak

342
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,160
再一起分享一瓶红酒啊
and share the bottle of wine.

343
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,500
谢了  不要
Not doing that.

344
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,600
我也没说过要啊
Never said we were.

345
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,790
其实这位是我爹
This is actually my dad.

346
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,560
我来这里是想要独处一阵  但他抄袭我
I came here for some alone time, but he copycatted me.

347
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,670
他明明说了不会来
He said he wasn't coming

348
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,080
因为他可怕的伴侣说不许他来
because his scary partner said he couldn't.

349
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,970
可怕的老公
Scary husband!

350
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,490
听起来还是别扭
Still hits my ear wrong.

351
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,980
你们都不打算...
Wow. So, you're not even gonna...

352
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,730
对不起
I-I'm sorry.

353
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,450
我只是...  我父亲在我十岁时去世了
Uh, just, my dad passed away when I was 10,

354
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,390
我愿付出一切跟他再共进晚餐
and I'd love to have dinner with him again.

355
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,180
奥斯丁  太可怜了
Oh, Austin. That's so sad.

356
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,310
烂故事
Terrible story.

357
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,040
害人得扪心自问
Makes you think.

358
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,880
言归正传  随便给我来杯别的红酒
Anyway, I'll have a glass of any of the reds.

359
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,680
我要白葡萄酒
White for me.

360
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,450
谢谢
Thank you.

361
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,870
抱歉啦  小兄弟
I'm sorry, buddy.

362
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,680
我不是故意这么用力拉你的腿的
I didn't mean to pull your leg so hard.

363
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,460
什么
What?!

364
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,480
迪伦一直是我的备胎
Dylan was my romantic safety net.

365
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,980
人没了备胎还怎么活啊
How is a person supposed to live without one?

366
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,240
艾丽克斯  我在问你呢
Alex, I'm asking!

367
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,830
从科学角度来说
It is scientifically impossible

368
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,760
我懒得鸟你破事的程度已到达极限
for me to care less about your -- Ow!

369
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,990
头朝下  亲爱的
Head down, honey.

370
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,610
-你说什么  -你们妈妈呢
- What?! - ‭Where is your mom?

371
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,530
她都不见了一个小时了
She's been gone for over an hour.

372
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,200
她就坐在车子里
She's just sitting in the car.

373
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,600
-什么  -什么
- What?! - ‭What?!

374
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,960
她就坐在...  算了
She's just sitting -- Never mind!

375
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,710
你好啊
Oh! Hi.

376
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,100
你好啊  你坐在这里多久了啊
Hi. How long you been sitting out here?

377
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,070
什么怪问题  我才刚开回来停下车
That's a weird question. I literally just drove in.

378
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,950
抱歉  我们通常都会在30分钟内送达的
Sorry. We usually try to get here in under 30 minutes.

379
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,100
谢谢  好的
Yeah, thank you. Okay.

380
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,030
谢谢
Thank you.

381
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,640
天啊  菲尔  我不能回去
Oh, God. Phil, I can't go back in there.

382
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,270
对不起  我试过了
I'm sorry. I tried.

383
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,390
我打开车门  但我的脚却抬不起来
I opened the door, but my legs wouldn't move.

384
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,210
亲爱的
Honey...

385
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,160
开车
Drive.

386
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,230
什么  那艾丽克斯的药怎么办
What? What about Alex's pills?

387
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,790
开车
Drive.

388
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,810
所以...我们就这么逃家了吗
So -- So we're running away from home.

389
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,400
这么做没关系吗
I mean, I-I-is that okay?

390
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,830
没关系  我们是跟三个成年人同住
Yes. We live with three adults.

391
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,720
我们就跟出租公寓楼的房东差不多
We're basically landlords in an apartment building.

392
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,440
我们就是《妙房东》
We're the Ropers!

393
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,290
{\an8}以电视剧《三人行》中房东夫妇为主题的衍生剧
《三人行》的主角刚好也是两女一男

394
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,290
对的  没错  我们想开去哪就开去哪
Yes! Yes! We could just drive and drive.

395
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,670
没错  我们辛苦了多年
Exactly! We've earned the right to 

396
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,380
空巢老人的生活是我们应得的
live the empty-nesters' life

397
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,180
哪怕现在巢里还孩满为患
even though we're still full-nesters.

398
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,950
天啊
Oh, my God!

399
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,660
你还记得那一瓶
Do you remember that bottle of wine

400
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,390
在海莉出生当晚我们特意留的那红酒吗
we put aside the night Haley was born?

401
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,810
记得  我们本来打算
Yes! We were gonna open it

402
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,820
在他们三个人搬走的那晚打开
the night all three of them moved out.

403
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,880
然后一起看我们因为他们
And watch one of the thousands of movies we missed

404
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,890
生病或肚子饿
'cause they were sick or hungry

405
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,860
或被玩具噎到而错过的无数电影
or choking on the head of a Power Ranger.

406
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,020
我是个还没看过《末路狂花》的女人
I am a woman who has never seen "Thelma and Louise."

407
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,360
那是我唯一错过的哈维·凯特尔电影
That's the only Harvey Keitel movie I've missed!

408
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,720
{\an8}该美国知名男演员有在名电影《末路狂花》中出演

409
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,230
我们开去哪
Where are we going?

410
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,720
让上天为我们安排吧
Let's let the universe decide.

411
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,640
"家人是你每天都收到的上天礼物"
"Family is a gift you receive every day."

412
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,510
现在还有讽刺内容的签文了吗
So they're making sarcastic ones now?

413
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,670
松鼠
Squirrel!

414
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,250
我们好像毁了某人的毕业典礼
I think we just ruined someone's graduation.

415
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,100
我肯定是睡着了
Ay! I must have fallen asleep.

416
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,200
不会吧
I don't see how.

417
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,710
那药冒出来的气味可真是不同凡响啊
The fumes coming off of that potion are something else.

418
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,740
是啊  等用完了以后  别扔掉
Yes. When we're done with this, don't throw it out

419
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,000
只需一茶匙  我能清理干净整个泳池
because with a teaspoon, I can clean the swimming pool.

420
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,300
好了  曼尼需要我去车库找他
Okay, Manny needs to see me in the garage.

421
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,440
我很快回来
I will be right back.

422
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,590
但一定要快啊
Yeah, but come right back

423
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,330
这东西不能用超过五分钟
because this cannot stay longer than five minutes.

424
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,340
就好奇一问  如果这东西
Oh, and just for fun, what would happen

425
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,650
用了比如说17分钟会怎么样啊
if it stayed on for, say, I don't know, 17?

426
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,660
人家说...
Well, they say that --

427
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,060
惨了
Ay, no!

428
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,350
不要啊
No!

429
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,560
你用乔的宝贝披风来包这臭东西吗
You used Joe's cape for this smelly thing?

430
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,110
-你知道这东西对他多重要吗  -不知道
- You know how important this is for him? ‭- No.

431
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,700
心中重要度是从我  斗篷  巧克力碎饼干
It goes me, the cape, chocolate chip cookies,

432
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,780
再到杰
and then Jay!

433
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,190
那我们能不能就说是杰搞的
Well, can't we just say Jay ruined it,

434
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,330
反正他已经在名单底层了
since he's already so far down the list?

435
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,280
你们有人看到我的斗篷吗
Has anyone seen my cape?

436
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,960
没有  它长什么样
Uh, no. What's it look like?

437
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,720
斗篷样啊
Like a cape!

438
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,120
对不起  没了它我压力好大
Sorry. It's just so stressful.

439
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,160
这样吧  我先去帮曼尼
You know what? I have to go to Manny.

440
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,330
然后洗乔的斗篷  再回来找你
Then I'll clean Joe's cape. Then I'll be back.

441
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,250
没事  去吧
It's okay. Go.

442
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,050
我们会在度假胜地坎昆这里等你
We will all be waiting for you here in Cancun.

443
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,060
有哪里出了问题  到处都是油
Something's wrong. There's oil everywhere!

444
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,470
估计只需要弄紧放油塞就行了
Well, you probably just need to tighten the drain plug.

445
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,810
你戳爆了她轮胎吗
You popped her tire?!

446
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,610
没事  没关系的
It's okay. It's all right.

447
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,590
杰都把补胎工具收哪了
Where does Jay keep his patch kit?

448
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,290
我花了20分钟才找到这里灯的开关
It took 20 minutes to find the light switch.

449
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,550
我能知道补胎工具在哪吗
I'm gonna know where a patch kit is?

450
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,020
别恐慌  我之前有在这里看到
Don't panic. I saw one here earlier.

451
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,040
找到啦
Here it is.

452
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,390
-别啊  别  -干嘛
- Oh, no! No! - ‭What?

453
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,360
那是乔的斗篷
That's Joe's cape!

454
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,300
不是吧
Oh, no!

455
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,190
这是乔最爱的东西了
Joe loves this cape more than anything.

456
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,160
心中重要度顺序是我  斗篷  巧克力碎饼干
It goes me, the cape, chocolate chip cookies --

457
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,980
要好了吗  曼尼
Almost done, Manny?

458
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,090
你来啦
Oh, hey.

459
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,110
其实早能好了  都是被我拖延进度
Yeah, well, he would be if I wasn't out here

460
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,190
回答了我一堆问题  比如说...
asking him so many questions about, you know,

461
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,670
怎么补车胎之类的  但就像他说的
how to -- how to patch a tire, but like he said,

462
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,100
补车胎的方法全都清楚写在
the directions are written clearly down

463
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,190
补胎工具包里了
inside the patch kit.

464
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,730
就算真的很棘手
And then if you get in a real jam,

465
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,720
网上也有无数教学影片啊
there's tons of videos online, anyway.

466
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,900
我们给他一点工作空间吧
Shouldn't we give him some space?

467
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,440
比如我们可以去喝杯茶
Maybe get some -- some tea?

468
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,620
春季舞会有舞伴了吗
So, do you have a date for spring formal?

469
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,290
我估计都不会去吧  我没合适的服装
I probably won't even go. I have nothing to wear.

470
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,740
天啊  天啊
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

471
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,290
也没这么严重啦
It's not that big of a deal.

472
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,970
世上还有人没饭吃呢
I mean, people are starving.

473
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,640
这不是什么迹象[指示牌]吧
This isn't a sign, is it?

474
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,980
绝对不是结实的指示牌  毕竟是五年级生搭的
Well, it's not a sturdy one, but they're only fifth-graders.

475
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,750
不是啦  我是说不该逃离家里的迹象
No! No, that we shouldn't have run away!

476
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,350
才不是  我们把这个绑好就能继续上路
No. We're just gonna tie this off, hit the open road,

477
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,810
一直开  开到冲马桶时
and keep driving until the toilets flush

478
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,000
漩涡旋转方向相反之地[南半球]
in the other direction.

479
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,860
天啊  要飘走了
Oh, God! Oh, no! It's floating away!

480
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,240
没事
Oh! Oh, okay!

481
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,520
卡在树上了  我们能拉回来
It's caught in the tree, we can reach it.

482
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,860
-上我肩膀  -什么
- Get on my shoulders! - What?

483
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,790
是啊  对的
Right! Oh, yeah, right. Oh!

484
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,870
对哦  我都忘了这招
Okay, I forgot about that.

485
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,880
等等  往前进
Oh, wait. Go forward!

486
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,980
太高了
It's too high!

487
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,350
抓那个线就行了  你是在抓那个线吗
Just reach for the string! Are you reaching for the string?

488
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,490
不是  我在假装看演唱会
No, I'm pretending I'm at a Def Leppard concert!

489
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,090
就在那里  你抓啊
It's right there! Just grab it!

490
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,490
我够不到  菲尔
I can't reach it, Phil!

491
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,690
我够不到"人生下一章"
I can't reach "The Next Chapter!"

492
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,190
我的天啊  放我下来  放我下来吧
Oh, my God. Let me down. Let me down.

493
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,160
-怎么了  -放我下来
- What? - Let me down.

494
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,900
怎么啦
What?

495
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,970
你没看出上天给我们的旨意吗
Don't you see what the universe is trying to tell us?

496
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,310
我们永远也到不了"人生下一章"
We are never gonna reach the next chapter.

497
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,940
卢克不会去上大学
Luke's not going to college.

498
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,970
海莉会在我们地下室住到老
Haley's gonna grow old in the basement.

499
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,520
艾丽克斯只会一直回来嘲讽我们
Alex is just gonna keep coming back to taunt us

500
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,220
然后用完我们的纸巾
and use up our tissues!

501
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,320
我觉得老天爷没对我们那么"关照"吧
I don't think the universe cares that much about us.

502
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,330
菲尔  我们想逃跑
Phil, we tried to run away,

503
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,510
但我从这里都还看得到我们家烟囱
and I can still see our chimney from here.

504
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,590
放弃吧
It's over.

505
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,400
好的  够了
Oh, yeah. This is it.

506
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,070
"欢迎来到
"Welcome...

507
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,480
我们的人生"
to our life!"

508
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,650
宝贝  我跟你一样不开心
Sweetheart, I-I am as upset as you are,

509
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,870
但事情本来就从未按我们计划的来过啊
but since when did anything work out the way we planned?

510
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,090
我们没计划过生海莉
We didn't plan on having Haley.

511
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,720
也没计划再生艾丽克斯
We didn't plan on having Alex.

512
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,230
我们的确是计划过生卢克
We did plan on having Luke,

513
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,980
但没计划过生出"卢克"这样的
but we didn't plan on having Luke.

514
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,790
我在闹脾气  但我也爱我们的孩子  真的
I'm having a tantrum. And I love our kids, I do.

515
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,030
大多数时候  我真的爱
Most of the time, I do.

516
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,400
只是在我心里
It's just I had this --

517
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,510
我有过对我们这阶段人生的憧憬
this picture of how our life would look right now.

518
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,290
不是现在这样子
This is not that.

519
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,090
完全不是
No.

520
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,880
是啊
Yeah.

521
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,760
我懂
I get it. ‭

522
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,570
或许...
Maybe...

523
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,720
或许我们不用放弃那憧憬
Maybe we don't have throw away the picture.

524
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,880
重新调整一下就行了
Just refocus it a little.

525
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,000
{\an8}《末路狂花》

526
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,910
轮爪螺母  撬胎棒
Lug nut. Tire iron.

527
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,240
格尔锤  鸽子门
Flugel hammer. Pigeon door.

528
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,640
这些词对我而言都是火星话
These are all nonsense words to me.

529
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,680
我都不知道我在这里干什么
I don't know what I'm doing here.

530
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,680
是啊  我也不知道我在这里干嘛啊
Yeah, well, I don't know what I'm doing here, either.

531
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,000
难道我就真的连独处一晚都不行
Am I so incapable of spending a night alone

532
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,920
还得跑来你家制造这么多麻烦吗
that I had to come over here and create all this drama?

533
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,160
难怪米奇尔想逃离我
No wonder Mitchell wanted to get away from me.

534
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,820
你们好了吗
Hello?

535
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,560
谢谢你啊  曼尼
Oh! Hey, well, thank you, Manny,

536
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,110
给我一个把最后的螺母拧紧的机会
for letting me tighten that last wheel screw.

537
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,790
或许下周你可以教我怎么街头式出拳
Maybe next week you could teach me how to street punch?

538
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,870
可以啊  没问题
Yeah. Sure!

539
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,690
小卡在楼上帮我找到的
Cam found it upstairs for me.

540
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,210
这件是你妈妈的裙子  是不是很怪啊
It's one of your mom's dresses. Isn't that crazy?

541
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,100
跟心理医生聊两句就没事了
I can see running it by a therapist.

542
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,150
看起来车好像弄好了
So, car looks done.

543
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,240
你有兴趣去...  比如说
Do you maybe want to, I don't know,

544
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,640
一起吃个东西之类的吗
go get something to eat?

545
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,450
没问题啊  但我身上有点脏
Uh, sure! But I'm a little dirty.

546
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,850
那又如何  挺可爱的啊
So? It's cute.

547
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,820
聊聊吗
A word?

548
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,160
你看
See?

549
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,470
就跟新...
Good as --

550
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,930
天啊
No! Oh.

551
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,890
看起来像被怪兽啃过
It looks like a monster ate it!

552
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,170
没错
Exactly.

553
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,190
你看  这代表你很有故事
See? It tells a story.

554
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,820
这是你跟恶龙大战时被它吐火烧的
This burn is from when you fought a dragon!

555
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,320
而这些油污呢
A-And these oil stains?

556
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,780
是在你拯救要掉下桥的
Well, they're from when you saved that 18-wheeler

557
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,430
加长大卡车时沾到的
from going off a bridge.

558
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,380
这是个超级英雄的斗篷
This is the cape of a superhero

559
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,690
他永远在人们需要时出现
who's always there for people in need.

560
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,960
飞走吧
Fly away!

561
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,020
你说得真好  小卡
That was so nice, Cam.

562
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,200
谢谢  你看起来好多了
Thanks. You look better.

563
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,790
你的烧也退了
And your fever's gone.

564
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,360
我不知道你在我外婆的药里加了什么
I don't know what you put in my abuela's potion,

565
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,670
但这次烧退得比以前任何一次都快
but it took care of the fever faster than ever.

566
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,420
你看  甚至还让我的牙变白了
Look! It even made my teeth whiter, huh?

567
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,070
你看看
Oh! Wow. Look at that.

568
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,850
我本来还在怨自己独处不了
Here I was beating myself up because I couldn't be alone,

569
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,720
但或许有人会觉得这个家里的所有人
and one could argue that everybody in this house

570
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,820
因为我的毛病而得到了好处
is a little better off because of it.

571
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,920
我损失了一条裙子  家里一股烧焦味
Well, I lost a dress and the house smells like smoke,

572
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,300
如果是我  我也不会过分自豪
so I wouldn't be high-fiving myself that much.

573
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,210
有事吗  先生
Ah, yes, sir?

574
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,770
对吧
Right?

575
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,280
没人可以把我的心悬在半空500页
Nobody keeps me on edge for 500 pages

576
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,120
然后故事说结束就结束
then decides they're just done writing.

577
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,700
你要么好好收尾  要么就根本别开始写
Either end the damn story or don't even write it!

578
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,900
对啊  就是嘛
Yes, exactly.

579
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,960
天啊  我还一度以为我哪里漏读[错过]了
God, for a minute, I thought I missed something.

580
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,950
是啊
You did.

581
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,640
你错过了你独处的夜晚读到一本好书的机会
The chance to read a great book on your one night alone.

582
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,030
至少牛排还蛮好吃的  对吧
Well, at least the steak was good, right?

583
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,580
肉的部位好  烹调得更好
Nice cut. Perfectly cooked.

584
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,620
酒也好喝
Terrific wine.

585
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,110
怎么  怎么  哪里好笑了
What? What's -- What's funny?

586
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,920
你啊
You.

587
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,640
牛排  书  这整段旅程
The steak, the book, hell, this whole trip.

588
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,150
你在变成我
You're turning into me!

589
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,780
没  才没有
No. No. Unh-unh.

590
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,890
才不是呢  爸  不不不
No, no, no. Dad. No, no.

591
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,380
是你在变成我
Hey. You're turning into me.

592
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,300
怎么说
How?

593
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,200
你居然能坚持把那本书看完
The fact that you stayed with that book at all,

594
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,720
这基本上就是两个男人的爱情故事
which is basically a love story between two men.

595
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,760
是兄弟情好吗
It's a buddy thing!

596
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,450
你少来了
Oh, please!

597
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,410
兄弟才不会找那么多机会
Buddies don't find that many opportunities

598
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,110
一起裸泳呢
to skinny-dip together.

599
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,600
每次只要他们一到水边
Every time they saw a body of water,

600
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,380
他们就脱裤子  跳进水里
it was off with the pants, splash!

601
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,630
拜托  别再把那书说得更恶心了
Come on. You're just making it worse.

602
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,640
天啊  你的手
Oh, my God! Your hands!

603
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,090
原来你预约水疗是为了这个
That's what your spa appointment was.

604
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,070
你去做了美甲
You got a manicure.

605
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,660
我去做是因为歌洛莉亚说我的手太粗糙
It's because Gloria said that my hands were too rough.

606
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,900
是她的主意
It was her idea.

607
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,590
体贴  我的风格
Considerate -- That's me.

608
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,350
逃离家人  我的风格
Running from your family -- That's me.

609
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,210
是啦  是啦
Yeah, yeah.

610
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,850
或许有可能是
Ah, I guess it's possible

611
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:01,060
我们两个都往彼此的中间移动了一点
that we both moved to the center a little.

612
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,740
是啦  挺有道理的
Yeah, well, it makes sense.

613
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,500
这样也让我们相处之间容易许多
It definitely makes things easier between us.

614
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,270
也少了点距离感
A little less distance.

615
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,740
是啊
Yeah.

616
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,550
是啦
Yeah.

617
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,610
我有一个...
Uh, hey, um... here's a --

618
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,530
有个疯狂的想法
It's a crazy thought.

619
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,850
有一件  有一件我们过去的自己
There's -- There's something old us could never do

620
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,470
不飙泪不骂人就做不到
without tears and screaming

621
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,340
但我觉得新的彼此可以做到的事
that I think new us might be able to handle.

622
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,810
这可以帮我在家里提升地位  如果你愿意帮的话
It might help me out at home, you know, if -- if you're game.

623
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,900
以手肘带动
Lead with your elbow.

624
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,960
转移你的重心
Shift your weight.

625
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,690
把球投出
Follow through.

626
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,620
不差
That's not bad.

627
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,980
但也不好  不过好歹我没在哭
No, it wasn't good, but I'm not crying

628
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,930
你也还没开始叫我"小姐"  继续吧
and you haven't called me "Missy", so let's keep going.

629
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,520
他们没得选了
They had no choice.

630
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,360
钩子上放了饵食就会亮红灯
The light turns red when you put something on it,

631
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,420
当饵食没了就会亮绿灯
green when the hook is free.

632
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,080
-我把它成为智能神钩  -太神了
- I call it a Smart Hook. - So smart.

633
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,040
这主意是我在室内停车场时受到启发
I got the idea... when I was in a parking garage.

634
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,250
-你知道他们的指示灯...  -天啊  爸  别回头看
- You know those little lights... - Oh, God, Dad. No, don't look.

635
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,310
-别看  -他们在这里干嘛
- Don't look. - What are they doing here?

636
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,700
他们不会想跟我们一起共进早午餐吧
They're not gonna want to have brunch with us, are they?

637
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,820
不可以  这是我们的日子
They can't! This is our day!

638
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,520
你觉得他们有看到我们吗
You think they see us?

639
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,140
继续走就对了
Just keep walking.

640
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,280
不要有突然的大动作
No sudden movements.

641
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,460
地图上写着这里还有另一家咖啡厅
The site maps say there's another cafe...

642
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,650
-我的书  -别捡了  
- My book. - Leave it!
