街上血流成河
Rivers of blood in the streets.

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,290
我知道的
I know it!

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,050
我能预见到

总得有人接替他  那不如就让我来

我叫詹姆斯・戈登

他是被人栽赃

15

掩盖真正的凶手

我知道警局被你捏在手中
I know that you own the police department.

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,660

"关心无家可归者"项目的工作人员

我们这儿有一些三明治和汤

还有曲奇饼  糖果

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,030
谁喜欢巧克力
Who here likes chocolate?

47
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,330
你不饿吗  小猫
Ain't you hungry, Cat?

48
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,480
没错  吃吧  拿个三明治
Yeah, dig in. Take a sandwich.

49
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,780
-我正需要这个  -是啊  吃吧
- This is what I need. - Sure, go ahead.

50
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,750
人人都够分
Plenty for everyone.

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,610
来吧  拿两个吧

52
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,140
干什么
Hey, lady.

53
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,220
该死的
Oh, fudge!

别担心  我这就去
Don't worry. I'll go.

55
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,600
慢点跑  牛仔
Slow down there, buckaroo.

56
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,430
我本来给你买了一杯  但不小心撒了

57

谢了

58
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,230
其他人呢
Where is everybody?

不知道
I don't know.

60
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,130
你怎么看
What do you think?

61
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,340
我看这轮班已经很辛苦了
I think it's been a long shift.

62
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,590
我们再为这流浪汉挨三小时  然后就收工
We give this bum three hours, then we knock off.

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,710
他是个老兵
He was a vet.

64
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,880
我向他的贡献致敬
I salute his service.

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,240
但如今他只是个死掉的流浪汉
Now he's a dead bum.

66
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,070
经常有人射杀流浪汉
People are shooting bums all the time.

67
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,330
找凶手跟找牙仙一样希望渺茫
We might as well be looking for the tooth fairy.

68
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,810
-你们好啊  -你好  博
- Hey, guys. - Hey, Bo.

69
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,500
你之前怎么没到场
How come you weren't here?

70
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,920
你也早上好啊
Good morning to you, too.

71
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,610
-你去哪了  -我在街那边的一家餐厅
- Where were you? - I was at a restaurant down the street here,

72
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,030
客如归餐厅  有个吸毒流浪少年
Chez Vous. They had some homeless junkie kid,

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,870
昨晚从他们的前窗摔了进去
fell through their front window last night.

74
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,800
我一直忙那事儿呢
I been taking care of that.

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,390
这可能是一起凶杀案
This is a potential murder.

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,480
你是应急人员
You're first responder.

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,810
你本应保护犯罪现场的完整性
You're supposed to preserve the integrity of the crime scene.

78
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,780
他说的有道理
He's got a point.

79
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,340
那家餐厅每月付我50美金让我罩着他们
The restaurant that pays me $50 a month to look out for them.

80
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,680
你要我守着一个死掉的醉汉吗
So I wanna babysit a dead wino?

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,890
我可是要养家糊口的啊
I got a family.

82
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,200
他说的也有道理
He's got a point.

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,750
那流浪少年为什么冲进前窗
Why'd the kid jump through the window?

84
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,520
谁知道呢  他嗑嗨了
Who knows? He was high.

85
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,270
你问过他了吗
Did you ask him?

86
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,520
你为什么把我当坏人
Why am I the bad guy here?

87
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,540
我问那个流浪少年的情况
I'm asking about the kid

88
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,570
因为他可能和这个死者有关
because maybe he's related to the victim.

89
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,900
而且你也不是坏人
And you're not a bad guy--

90
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,010
你只是个坏警察而已
you're just a bad cop.

91
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,330
-你和谁说话呢  -冷静
- Who you talking to? - Hold on.

92
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,330
你知道吗  我已经...
You know, I already had...

93
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,480
来啊  来呀
Come on. Come on!

94
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,270
你想打一架吗  随时奉陪
You want it? Any day!

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,590
然后泽博和斯莫克就径直倒下了
And then Zeb and Smoke went right down,

96
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,970
然后那个怪人开枪杀了老兵
and that's when that wacky dude just shot Soldier.

97
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,720
然后我就意识到我得赶快逃走
That's when I realized I needed to get out of there.

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,100
我就跑啊跑
So I ran and I ran,

99
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,360
所以才跌进那家餐厅的地上
and that's how I ended up on the floor of that restaurant.

100
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,360
她用了大头针
She used a pin.

101
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,010
我发誓  超大的针
I swear. A big pin.

102
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,870
但听着  这不是第一次了
But, listen, this is not the first time.

103
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,840
这几周一直有流浪少年失踪
Street kids have been disappearing for weeks now.

104
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,060
已经有十多个人了  没人知道原因
By the dozen. No one knows why.

105
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,120
-这是我第一次听说  -当然了
- First we heard about it. - Why-why would you?

106
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,960
没人在乎我们
Nobody gives a crap about us.

107
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,140
瞧  这就能证明
I mean, look! That is proof!

108
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,550
那就是个疤  能证明什么  听着  迈奇
That's not proof. That's a scab. Now, listen, Macky,

109
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,170
我们都是成年人了  我们比你聪明
we're grown-ups. We're smarter than you.

110
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,960
随你怎么说吧
Man, whatever.

111
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,540
所以  你要告诉我真相
So you're gonna... you're gonna tell me the truth!

112
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,820
是你干的  对不对
It was you, wasn't it?

113
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,670
是你杀了那个可怜的老人
It was you that killed that poor old man.

114
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,320
就是你  你得跟我实话实说
It was you. Now, you're gonna tell me the truth,

115
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,530
不然我对天发誓  我打也要把真相打出来
or I swear to God, I'm gonna beat it out of you!

116
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,770
那个老人是退伍军人啊
That old man was a war veteran!

117
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,720
小猫当时也在
Listen, Cat was there.

118
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,260
小猫全都看到了  去问她
Cat saw the whole thing. Ask Cat.

119
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,300
-去问小猫  -别激动  迈奇
- Ask Cat! - Relax, Macky, relax.

120
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,690
没人会打你的  小猫是谁
No one's gonna beat you. Who's Cat?

121
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,700
什么叫没人会打他
What do you mean, no one's gonna beat him?

122
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,040
我不是刚说要打他吗  就刚才
Isn't that what I just said I was gonna do right now, just now?

123
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,010
-我要打他  -过来
- I was gonna beat him? - Come here!

124
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,400
过来  过来
Come here. Come here.

125
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,210
他才16岁
He is 16.

126
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,990
一米八的个头又那么壮  打一拳没事的
Yeah, and six-foot, 220. He can take a punch.

127
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,120
我不会真打他的  只是想吓吓他
Look, I wasn't gonna beat him. I just wanted to scare him.

128
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,330
但我要是真想打他  我也能打
But if I did want to beat him, I could.

129
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,280
-那是我的特权  -这不合法
- It would be my prerogative. - It's illegal.

130
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,130
不合...
Ill...

131
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,520
你现在又这么义正言辞了
How now so righteous?

132
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,530
你不是才把一个人扔进河里吗
Not long since you put a man in the river.

133
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,310
说大点声行吗
You want to say that a little louder?

134
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,670
有人没听到
Not everybody heard.

135
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,370
自那以后  你就一直给我找麻烦
Ever since then, you've been a royal pain in the ass.

136
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,840
你以为我或这里的任何人
You think I or anybody around here

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,570
会在意一个死掉的告密者
gives a crap about a dead snitch

138
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,930
或者你的良心不安吗
or your guilty conscience?

139
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,550
-我们有自己要担心的  -良心不安
- We got our own problems. - Guilty conscience,

140
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,000
随你怎么说  我要做正确的事
call it what you want. I'm gonna do what's right.

141
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,680
你真有点惹火我了
You're beginning to irritate me.

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,130
把你的手拿开
Get your hands off me.

143
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,700
别踩我鞋  混蛋
Watch the shoes, clown.

144
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
下班了
Shift's over.

145
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,960

我很感激  我等了好久了
I'm very grateful. I've been waiting for hours.

150
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,810
可不是  你看起来像从坟地里爬出来的
No kidding. Look like you crawled out of a cemetery.

151
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,150
闻着也像  把后面的窗户打开
Smells like it, too. Open a window back there.

152
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,790
-好了  -嗯
- There you go. - Yeah.

153
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,260
谢谢你
Yes, thank you.

154
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,610
不好意思  现在有点衣冠不整
Forgive me, I am somewhat disheveled.

155
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,740
只是暂时受挫  我保证
A temporary setback, I assure you.

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,930
非常感谢
Thank you so much.

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,050
到底发生什么事了
What the hell happened to you anyhow?

158
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,730
是我的错
It was my own fault.

159
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,510
愚蠢的自大蒙蔽了我
Foolish arrogance led me astray.

160
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,170
但我吸取了教训
But I learned my lessons.

161
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,100
我会重新站起来  比以前更强更聪明
I'll be back, stronger and smarter than ever.

162
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,280
祝你好运了  老兄
Good luck with that, bro.

163
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,720
我坐在漂亮的车里
Here I am riding around in a lovely truck,

164
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,550
跟我的新朋友一起喝冰啤兜风
sharing an ice-cold beer with my new friends.

165
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,350
我已经转运了  不是吗
My luck's already turned, right?

166
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,510
老兄  有人跟你说过
Dude, anyone ever tell you,

167
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,120
你走起路来像只企鹅吗
when you walk, you look just like a penguin?

168
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,940
没有
No.

169
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,070
没人跟我说过
Nobody's ever told me that.

170
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,600
哥谭
第一季第二集

171
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,510
他说他有权拦着我不让我揍流浪汉
He's saying he has a right to stop me from beating on a mope.

172
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,490
我当然有权
Damn right I do.

173
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,620
让我怎么跟这种人合作
How am I supposed to work with this?

174
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,920
听着  吉姆  我又不能叫你去犯法
Look it, Jim, it's not like I can order you to break the law,

175
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,540
但这里是哥谭
but this is Gotham.

176
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,470
你不妥协  就活不下去
You don't bend, you'll get broke.

177
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,220
我明白
I understand.

178
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,920
我以为你是会合作的
I thought you were with the program.

179
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,680
-他是  -那继续说案子的事吧
- He is. - Well, let's get back to work.

180
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,900
-查得怎样了  -如果那小子说得是真的
- Where are you at? - Well, if the boy we have is telling the truth,

181
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,840
那就是有一个绑架团伙
there's a couple of kidnappers out there

182
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,090
在大肆绑架无家可归的少年
abducting homeless children in numbers.

183
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,690
他们开着市长"关心无家可归者"项目的卡车
They lured them close with a food truck

184
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,810
把这些孩子吸引过来  然后下手
from the mayor's Homeless Outreach Project.

185
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,260
手法是用一根大针头刺他们来下药
And they drugged them with a jab from a big pin.

186
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,840
怎么会有人想绑架一大堆邋里邋遢的流浪孤儿
Wh-Why would anyone want to abduct scaggly-ass orphans in bulk?

187
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,270
哪有市场需求啊
I mean, where's the market?

188
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,050
他们上街流浪  正是因为他们没人管没人要
They're out on the street because no one wants them anyway.

189
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,950
要是说有人绑架漂亮妹子
If they said they were snatching cute girls,

190
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,900
这我信
I'd believe 'em.

191
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,470
但谁会想要迈奇这种没用的猪头
But what would anyone want with a lard-ass like Macky?

192
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,670
怎么了  爱德
What is it, Ed?

193
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,370
猜猜我发现了什么
Guess what I found.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
我给他验了血  检测出了大量的ATP
I did a blood test on him, and he had high levels of ATP.

195
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,820
什么是ATP呀
What's ATP?

196
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,190
是一种速效迷药
It's a fast-acting knockout drug.

197
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,280
阿卡姆疯人院以前用过这药
They used to use it at the old Arkham Asylum

198
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,450
来药倒闹得凶的病人
to bring down troublesome patients.

199
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,460
很难搞到
It's hard to get.

200
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,810
也没什么消遣作用
No recreational use.

201
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,250
好吧  是有点意思
Okay. That's interesting.

202
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,260
还有别的吗
Anything else?

203
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,960
多谢了  爱德
Thank you, Ed.

204
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,790
谢谢你了  爱德
Thank you, Ed.

205
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,310
去查吧
Get to work.

206
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,890
别走漏消息
And keep this quiet.

207
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,830
不能让媒体知道  一个字都不行
No press. Not a word.

208
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,680
难道不该把情况告诉公众吗
Shouldn't we tell the public what's going on?

209
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,440
-警告他们一下  -本局有政策
- Warn them? - Department policy.

210
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,640
这种事我们不声张  以免引起恐慌
We don't advertise this kind of stuff. Causes panic.

211
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,360
头条肯定会写"哥谭儿童遭到绑架"
The headlines will read "Gotham's Kids Snatched."

212
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,050
-这确有其事  -不让媒体知道  这是命令
- Which would be true. - No press. That's an order.

213
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,310
追查ATP这种药的线索
Follow up on the drug, the ATP

214
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,660
还有跟阿卡姆的联系
and the Arkham connection.

215
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,460
阿卡姆都关了十多年了
Arkham's been closed for, like, ten years.

216
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,750
没错  15年了
Yeah, 15.

217
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,860
供药商可能还没关门
Drug suppliers might still be in business.

218
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,220
这事发生在菲什・穆尼的地盘上
This happened on Fish Mooney's turf.

219
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,160
要不要先问问我们去查安不安全
Do you want to see if it's safe for us to go back there,

220
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,810
看看她是不是还在生我们的气
or is, uh, she still mad at us?

221
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,540
问得好
That's a good question.

222
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,570
精彩
Bravo!

223
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,340
太精彩了
Bravo!

224
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,950
法尔科内阁下
Don Falcone.

225
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,990
实在是意外之喜  快请坐
What a wonderful surprise. Welcome.

226
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,230
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, my dear.

227
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,340
我们能聊聊吗
Can we... talk?

228
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,290
-当然  我先清场  -不必
- Of course. Give me a moment to clear the place. - No, no.

229
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,140
不必搅了大家的兴致
No need to spoil the fun.

230
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,430
人之将死  其言也善
Men who are about to die are very honest.

231
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,170
善言值得一听
It pays to listen to them.

232
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,300
好个祝酒词
That's some toast.

233
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,720
你手下科波特死前  我和他谈过
I spoke with your man Cobblepot before he died.

234
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,310
真是个奇怪的小子  但挺聪明
Odd little fellow. Perceptive.

235
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,040
他和我说韦恩夫妇的死
He told me the death of the Waynes

236
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,160
会给我们家族和哥谭带来麻烦
would bring troubled times for our family and Gotham.

237
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,270
那小子知道什么
What did he know?

238
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,050
我们的生意依旧蒸蒸日上
Business is good as ever.

239
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,380
不  他说得对
No, he was right.

240
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,450
韦恩夫妇和法尔科内家族是同一栋房子的支柱
The Waynes and the Falcones were the pillars of the same house.

241
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,130
我们彼此理解
We understood each other.

242
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,810
现在他们死了  一切都失去了平衡
Now that they're gone, everything is out of balance,

243
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,080
韦恩帝国也会摇摆不定
and the Wayne Empire is in flux.

244
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,630
谁知道最终谁将大权在握呢
Who knows who will end up in control?

245
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,230
马罗尼家族察觉局势不稳
The Maroni family senses weakness.

246
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,520
就会开始有所行动
They'll start making moves,

247
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,800
这座城市的所有罪犯也都会开始有所行动
and every criminal in the city will start making moves.

248
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,760
可别为马罗尼担心
Please don't lose any sleep over Maroni.

249
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,140
他居于第二位  不是没有原因的
He's number two for a reason.

250
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,290
我从不担心我的敌人
I never lose sleep over my enemies.

251
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,090
倒是我的朋友令我担忧
It's my friends that keep me awake.

252
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,700
科波特告诉我你跟他说
Cobblepot told me you say

253
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,930
我年老不中用了  该铲除我了
I'm old and soft and ready to be taken out,

254
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,790
你就是该取代我的人
and you're the one to take me.

255
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,130
法尔科内阁下  我是绝对
Don Falcone, I would never,

256
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,330
不会这么说的
ever say that.

257
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,050
我对您只有深深的爱意及敬意
I only have deep love and respect for you.

258
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,210
对我而言  您就像父亲
You have been like a father to me.

259
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,820
我很高兴听你这么说
I'm so... happy to hear that.

260
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,620
忘记刚才所说的一切吧
Let's forget all about it, then.

261
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,710
不过是将死之人的胡言乱语
The babbling of a condemned man.

262
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,970
公事说完了
Enough business.

263
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,660
你最近怎么样  亲爱的
How have you been, my dear?

264
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,860
但愿你一切都好
Thriving, I hope.

265
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,050
是的  很好  很好
Yes. Good. I'm good.

266
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,690
哪一个是你的情人
Which of these is your lover?

267
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,980
拜托  我的心早被爱情什么的伤透了
Please. My heart has been broken far too many times for that nonsense.

268
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,070
我听说你有个情人
I heard you had a lover.

269
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,690
如果你是指我拿来活动身子的男人...
Well, if you're referring to the boy that I keep around for exercise-

270
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,570
他可绝不是我的情人
my lover he is not.

271
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,590
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

272
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,010
我叫拉兹罗  先生
Lazlo, sir.

273
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,450
拉兹罗  对她好点
Lazlo, be good to this woman.

274
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,140
她可是我的至宝
She's very precious to me.

275
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,190
如果你伤了她的心
If you break her heart,

276
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,020
也就是伤我的心
you break my heart.

277
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,300
是  先生
Yes, sir.

278
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,420
把你的手给我
Give me your hand.

279
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,910
谢谢你的坦诚  这对我来说很重要
Thank you for being honest. It means a lot to me.

280
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,720
这显示了你的智慧
It shows wisdom

281
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,150
和谦虚
and humility.

282
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,100
出去
Out!

283
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,500
全部给我滚出去
Everyone out!

284
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,210
我儿子这辈子从没离开我这么久过
Never, never in his life my son is away this long.

285
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,240
夜店是他的事业
Nightclubs is his business.

286
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,210
总工作到很晚
Such hours.

287
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,910
但他总是会回家  回到母亲身边
But always, he comes home to his mother.

288
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,100
他的衣服都在这儿
His clothes are here.

289
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,830
我儿子绝对不会落下他的衣服的
My son would never leave his clothes.

290
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,420
他是那么讲究
Oh, so elegant, he is.

291
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,320
我拿给你们看
Yes, I-I show you.

292
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:01,730
见鬼
Damn.

293
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,330
穆尼肯定是联手警局的人把他给杀了
Mooney and the cops must have had him killed.

294
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,560
那就是告密的小子被干掉了
Looks like the snitches get bumped.

295
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,550
人生就这么残酷
That's life.

296
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,030
我不会让他们逍遥法外的
They're not going to get away with it,

297
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,390
没这么容易
not as easy as they think.

298
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,080
你总是太容易动感情  你知道吗
You take things too personally, you know what?

299
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,650
当然  他是个好线人
Yeah, I do. That was a good snitch.

300
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,990
-你们说什么呢...  -没什么
- What are we...? - Nothing.

301
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,410
科波特太太
Uh, Mrs. Cobblepot...

302
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,000
卡佩普特
Kapelput.

303
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:24,490
卡佩普特太太  您知道有谁会想要伤害您儿子吗
Mrs. Kapelput, do you know anyone who might want to do your son harm?

304
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,600
伤害
Harm?

305
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,790
没有  我会察觉到的
No. I-I would feel it.

306
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,240
母亲能察觉到这种事
A mother feels these things.

307
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,230
是个女人
It's a woman.

308
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,530
是个浓妆艳抹的婊子拴住了他
Some painted slut has him in her clutch.

309
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,680
你觉得  是因为女人
A woman... you think?

310
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,260
我敢肯定
I am sure.

311
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,800
他是那么帅
So handsome he is.

312
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
还很天真
And so naive.

313
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,550
你们是谁来着
Who are you again?

314
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,300
重案组的警探  女士
Uh, detectives with Major Crimes Unit, ma'am.

315
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,230
哥谭市警局
Oh, GCPD.

316
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,480
差不多
Like that.

317
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,220
但清廉一些
But honest.

318
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,330
老大  别生我气
Boss, don't get mad at me,

319
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,230
不过我懂那表情
but I know that look.

320
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,290
现在对法尔科内动手还太早
Now is too early to make a move on Falcone.

321
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,750
我知道
I know.

322
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,930
时候未到
Not yet.

323
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,860
我需要更多的钱  人力  还有领土
I need more money, more men, more territory,

324
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,480
我知道
I know.

325
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,530
我会假装忠诚  等待时机
I'll play this thing loyal and bide my time.

326
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,550
但我向我母亲神圣的坟墓起誓  布奇
But I swear, Butch, on my sainted mother's grave,

327
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,320
不久之后
some day soon,

328
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,110
我就会用我的双手和利齿  杀了那个老头子
I am going to kill that old man with my bare hands and my teeth.

329
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,950
我会为您提鞋的
I'll be holding your shoes.

330
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,250
我真希望那个小企鹅还活着
I just wish that Penguin was still alive.

331
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:05,750
那小混蛋受得折磨真是远远不够
I didn't make that little punk suffer near badly enough.

332
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,370
打扰了  先生
Excuse me, sir?

333
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,550
我注意了您拖车上的标志
I couldn't help but notice the sign on your trailer.

334
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,240
{\an8}出租

335
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,660
还可以租吗
Is it still for rent?

336
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,540
一百块一周  不算太好  不过...
100 bucks a week. It ain't much, but...

337
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,930
-我租了  -你不先看看吗
- I'll take it. - You don't want to look at it first?

338
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,250
不了  我不挑剔
No, I'm not fussy.

339
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
归你了
It's all yours.

340
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,330
钥匙呢
The key?

341
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,740
车不错啊  装了汽缸发动机吗
Hey, sweet truck. You got that big hemi in there?

342
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,470
是啊  是的
Yes. Yup.

343
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,050
是有个汽缸发动机
That big hemi's in there.

344
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,090
什么的
Somewhere.

345
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,700
先生  钥匙呢
Uh, sir, the key?

346
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,460
在门上呢
It's in the door.

347
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,220
好的
Okay.

348
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,620
好啊  二位
What's up, players?

349
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,780
你们有烟吗
You got any smokes?

350
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,800
没有
No.

351
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,200
我们在哪
Where are we?

352
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,850
我哪知道
Damn if I know.

353
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,140
我觉得我们死定了
I think we're dead.

354
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,180
哈维
Harvey.

355
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,670
吉姆  真太好了
Jim. How marvelous.

356
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,020
你还在生我们气呢
You still mad at us?

357
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,840
没有  得了
No. Please.

358
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,120
我挺喜欢你的  而你...
I'm quite fond of you, and...

359
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,640
让我感兴趣
you intrigue me.

360
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,250
我一下令杀了你们  我就知道我会后悔
I knew I'd regret killing you as soon as I gave the word.

361
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,380
但你了解我的  我火气大
But you know me. I'm feisty.

362
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,310
你了不了解
What do you know about

363
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,150
在你地盘上绑架流浪少年的一男一女
a man and a woman abducting street kids on your turf?

364
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,370
你不玩前戏是吧
No foreplay with you, hmm?

365
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,140
猜到了  不过你也是自己人了
Figures, but you got with the program.

366
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,940
你自己亲手杀了小企鹅
Killed Penguin your own bad self.

367
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,450
我真没想到
I was surprised.

368
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,050
你那么正直呢
Straight arrow like you.

369
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,210
-看来你看错了我  -看来是的
- I guess you misjudged me. - I guess I did.

370
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,100
你也是个罪人  跟我们其他人一样
You're just a little sinner like the rest of us.

371
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,840
我都有点为此难过呢
I'm almost kind of sad about that.

372
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,130
我们在找一男一女
We're looking for a man and a woman,

373
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,520
中年
middle-aged,

374
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,520
白人
white,

375
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,540
他们对不满16岁的孩子下手
targeting children under 16.

376
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,270
作案工具是毒针  相信吗
They use a poisoned pin, if you can believe it.

377
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,370
要是以前只有漂亮姑娘才有市场
Used to be there was only a market for nice-looking girls.

378
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,490
我也是这么说的
That's what I said.

379
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,080
但现在有个国外的新买家
But now there's a new buyer overseas

380
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,320
他们愿接受所有年轻健康的人
that will take anyone young and healthy.

381
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,210
国外哪里  谁是"他们"
Overseas where? Who's "they"?

382
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,740
没人知道
Nobody knows.

383
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,840
他们想做什么
What do they want 'em for?

384
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,420
没人知道
Nobody knows.

385
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,320
也没人想知道
And no one cares to know.

386
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,090
来啦  木须肉
Ta-da! Moo shu.

387
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,570
抱歉  继续说
Sorry. Go on.

388
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,420
他们用长针毒晕他们
They drug them with a big pin?

389
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,800
好恐怖
That is so creepy.

390
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,040
不说了  你不会想听的  太让人郁闷了
No, you don't want to hear this stuff. It's depressing.

391
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,350
他们拿那些孩子做什么
What do they use them for? The children?

392
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,320
没人知道
Nobody seems to know.

393
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,290
而且不能向媒体透露  不利于形象
And we can't say a damn thing to the press. Bad PR.

394
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,650
真难以相信警局这么腐败
I can't believe the system is so corrupt.

395
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,060
-你都想不到  -这话什么意思
- You have no idea. - What do you mean?

396
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,490
没有  就是说说啦
No. You know, figure of speech, I guess.

397
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,190
你有没有事瞒着我
Did something happen that you're not telling me about?

398
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,560
这几周
These last couple of weeks...

399
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,970
你很不对劲  忧心忡忡的
You've been different, troubled.

400
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,570
没有
No.

401
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,300
可能最近睡眠不好
Been having trouble sleeping, I guess.

402
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,880
报社一定常常接到匿名线报
The newspapers must get anonymous tips all the time.

403
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,510
那是
Oh, sure, yeah.

404
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,390
什么  我自己泄密吗
You mean, call it in myself?

405
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,420
不行  我不能那么做
No, I can't do that.

406
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,520
是《哥谭公报》新闻编辑部吗
Gotham Gazette. The newsroom.

407
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,890
别这样
Wait. No.

408
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,350
你好  是这样  我不能说太久
Hi. Listen, I can't talk long.

409
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,800
最近有人在绑架街上的流浪儿
Somebody is abducting homeless children off the streets,

410
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,310
警方试图对此保密
and the cops are trying to keep it quiet.

411
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,020
去找哥谭市警局的莎拉・艾森警监聊聊
Go talk to Captain Sarah Essen of the GCPD.

412
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,230
她那儿有个被拘留的孩子能跟你讲清楚
She has got a kid in custody who can tell you the whole story.

413
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,660
-挂电话  -我得挂了
- End the call. - I got to go.

414
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,560
听我说  芭芭拉
Listen to me, Barbara.

415
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
我跟你说的事  是咱俩之间的秘密
When I tell you stuff, that's just between us.

416
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,420
你以后不能再这样做了
You can't do that, what you just did.

417
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,680
但这才是正确的做法
But it was the right thing to do.

418
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
-这不是重点  -那重点是什么
- That's not the point. - Well, what is the point?

419
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,370
你说得对  这是正确的做法
You're right. It was the right thing to do.

420
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,490
但别再这么做了  行吗
Don't do it again, okay?

421
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,950
是  长官
Yes, boss.

422
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,150

425
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,590
"保证马上采取行动"

426
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,160
"矛头指向警局的迟钝反应"  等等
"Points finger at police department's sluggish response." Et cetera.

427
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,040
报纸而已
It's just ink.

428
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,950
是你泄的密吗
Did you give them this?

429
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:55,860
我
Me?

430
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,020
你也不是没做过
You've done it before.

431
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,130
给自己下绊子  绝不可能
On my own case? Never.

432
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,270
那可太傻了
Be a very stupid thing to do.

433
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,300
吉姆
Jim?

434
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,960
不是我说的
I didn't call it in.

435
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,020
我发誓
I swear.

436
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,990
又一桩谜案啊
Another mystery.

437
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,910
我们找到了条模糊线索  您想听吗  长官
We have a thin lead on the case, if you'd like to hear it, ma'am.

438
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,660
哥谭只有三家公司存储这种迷药
There's only three companies in Gotham that stock this ATP stuff,

439
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,330
而且需要特殊许可证才能购买
and you need a special license to buy it.

440
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:19,040
很可能是其中一家在和他们同流合污
Chances are, one of the three's crooked.

441
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,150
我们打算给三家都施加点压力
We're looking to lean hard on all three,

442
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,740
当作是犯了事对待  看谁会露马脚
like they are crooked, see which one pops.

443
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,370
你装的真像
That was sneaky good.

444
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,440
差点就被你骗过去了
Almost couldn't tell you were lying.

445
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,690
我说的是真话
I wasn't lying.

446
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,560
早上好  贝克法官
Good morning, Judge Baker.

447
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,910
谢谢  先生  是的  三家都要

450
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,630
你们把我害惨了
You guys have screwed me.

451
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,020
我虽觉得不妥
Against my better judgment,

还让你们借用我的仓库
I let you guys use my storage space

454
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,600

你不会受牵连的
You'll be clean as a whistle.

货物
Merch?

463

是活生生的人
They're human beings.

465

我不是10分钟前就让你去看看他们了吗

那是你的问题  我可以等
That's your problem. I can wait.

471
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,220
你不是担心会招来麻烦吗
I thought you was worried about the heat.

472
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,440
如果麻烦真的来了
Well, if heat arrives in the meantime,

473
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,820
我也可以很迅速地消灭证据
I can get rid of the evidence very quickly.

474

我们必须把货送到
We have an obligation to deliver.

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,610
人偶师绝不会容许失败
The Dollmaker doesn't tolerate failure.

476
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,890
我们需要那些孩子
We need those children.

477
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,670
那也是你们的问题
Well, that's also your problem.

478
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,180
不  这太过分了
No. Hey, hey, this is totally inappropriate.

479
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,790
我们是在谈生意哎
I mean, we were having a business discussion here.

480
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,300
但你太不讲理了
You weren't being fair.

481
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,410
倒霉  是警察
Oh, gosh. Cops.

482
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,730
你是没给公报打电话  但你女朋友打了  对吧
You didn't call the Gazette, but did your girl call the Gazette?

483
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,270
{\an8}药房

484
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,540
对

485
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,100
-我就知道  -我也不知道她会打啊
- I knew it. - I didn't know she was gonna call 'em.

486
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:21,660
说真的  你得好好管管你的女人了
Seriously, you got to learn to control your woman.

487
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,070
我倒挺喜欢她这样呢
I kind of like her the way she is.

488
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,900
这些上流社会的任性小妞
No, these high-class temperamental broads --

489
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
她们需要好好管教  相信我吧

490
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,220
-相信你对女人的判断  -一点没错

我泡过各种女人  从家庭主妇到电影明星

我都喜欢  你呢  我猜猜看

高中女友  在海外时嫖过

但你并不开心
only made you sad,

495
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,640
然后就遇到了芭芭拉
and then there's Barbara.

496
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,190

Pretty much.

497

伙计  你就是只骑着赛马的猴子

戈登和布洛克警探  我们需要

500
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,800

503
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,440
希望没什么大事
Nothing serious, I hope.

504
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,260
别废话  我们有对这里的搜查证
Cut the crap. We have a warrant to search the premises.

505
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,350
我们知道你干了什么
We know what you're doing.

506
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,550

508
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,990
你在给绑架孩子的人提供ATP
You're peddling ATP to those kid snatchers.

509
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,120
我的天哪  没有啊
Oh, my gosh, no. I-I mean,

510
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,810
我们以前是囤有ATP
we used to stock ATP,

511
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,260
但阿卡姆疯人院关了之后就没有了
but not since the Arkham Asylum closed.

512
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,420

515
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,380
一切都是未知数了吧
I guess everything's up in the air.

516

没人是安全的

快去干掉他们
Get rid of 'em now.

把房间洗干净
And hose down the room.

不许动

我谨代表哥谭市民

衷心地感谢二位勇敢的警探

我们会照顾好你们
we will take care of you

528
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,160
就像对待自己家人一样
as if you were our own children.

529
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,350
但问题是
But here's the thing.

530
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,250
伤害这些孩子的人仍逍遥法外
The people who victimized these kids are still out there.

531

532
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,330
仍落魄街头

孤苦伶仃  无人保护
Alone, unprotected,

534
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,520
我们面对现实吧  这才是真正的罪孽

535
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,300
我们要怎么保护这些孩子
So what are we going to do to help these kids?

00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,770
昨天  我已联络青少年保护机构和哥谭市警局
Yesterday I made a phone call to Juvenile Services and the GCPD

537
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,090
启动了一项人道的严爱计划

538
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,240
将流落街头的孩子

539
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,050
送入青少年保护机构的温暖怀抱中

你把抓起来的孩子送到哪里去了

可爱健康的送去寄养家庭

547
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,850
其余的送去州北

00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,840
州北
Upstate?

549
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,380

The Alpena Youth Corrections Facility.

550
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,690
一家不错的机构
A fine institute.

551
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,590
换句话说就是监狱
Prison, in other words.

552

吉姆  我可以叫你吉姆吗

他们需要管教

559
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,780
需要有人照顾
People who care for them.

560
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:18,860
这是为了哥谭的大局和这些孩子着想啊  懂吗

561
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,770
我只知道你利用儿童绑架犯作幌子
I see you're using the child snatchers as a pretext

562
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,160
不经审理就将这些孩子关起来

563
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,500
谢谢你  朋友
Thank you, my friend.

我不该去州北的

gets a black mark right here.

605
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:24,460
少了一个  或两三个  我还能解释
One or two or three-- I could explain that.

606
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,800
但少了一车
But a busload--

607
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,020
整整一车的小杂种
a whole busload of the little bastards--

608
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,440
你要我怎么解释
what am I supposed to say?

609
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,130
"不小心哦"  求你告诉我  不是他们干的
Oops? Just tell me it wasn't them, I'm begging you.

610
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,140
千万别是那些绑架犯干的
Just tell me it wasn't the snatchers.

611
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,980
开车的是个男人  警卫是女的
Bus driver was a man, guard was a woman.

612
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,270
可能是他们
It could be them.

613
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,900
你要害死我了  你要害死我了
You're killing me. You're killing me.

614
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,330
我们在查了  阁下
We're working it, Your Honor.

615
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,800
我知道的都告诉你们了  我都说了
Look, I told you everything I know. I told you.

616
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,250
看到旁边这人了吗
Now, you see that man there?

617
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,590
他不喜欢我动手打人
He doesn't like it when I beat people,

618
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,230
但对你他完全没意见  为什么呢
but for you, he's got no objection. Why is that?

619
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,190
我算得清
Math.

620
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,780
30个孩子抵得上你这人渣的狗命
The lives of 30 children versus one scumbag.

621
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,420
所以就算我拿你当鼓打
So I can beat you like a bongo drum

622
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,350
这位圣人也不会说一句
and Saint Jim here won't intervene.

623
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,650
给我们点线索
Give us something.

624
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,600
好吧
Okay, okay, look...

625
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,530
那辆卡车
The truck.

626
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,090
就是他们来接最后一批孩子时开的那辆
You know, when they came to pick up the last bunch of kids.

627
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,250
车侧面有张图片
On the side of it, there was a-a picture.

628
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,260
像个商标那种
Like a logo.

629
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,460
我之前没说
I-I didn't want to say before

630
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,100
是因为会让人往坏处想
because it would give a bad impression.

631
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,830
因为也未必就是...
See, it doesn't reflect, really, what, you know...

632
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,370
-到底是什么  -一张蓝盘子和一把银叉子
- What was it? - It has a... a blue plate and a silver fork.

633
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,570
-盘子和叉子  -对  就是那种...
- A plate and a fork? - Yeah, you know, like, with the...

634
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,850
-你是说餐饮公司那种的吗  -嗯
- Like a catering company? Like food? - Well, yeah, like that,

635
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,360
就是那样  不过那也未必就是...
I mean, you know, but, I mean, that doesn't mean... You know.

636
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,700
未必是什么
Doesn't mean what?

637
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,070
我不知道他们要拿那些孩子怎么样
Look, I don't know what they do to them. Aah!

638
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,050
好了  画出那个商标  解开手铐
All right, draw the logo. Uncuff him.

639
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,740
好嘞  孩子们
There you go, kids.

640
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,260
别担心  没事的
Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right.

641
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,670
就这样  快点走
That's right. That's right. Come on.

642
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,260
-快走  -快点
- Come on, come on, come on, come on. - Come on!

643
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,400
快走
Go.

644
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,830
真有意思  我没数错的话
Funny thing. By my count,

645
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,920
按他们给我们的名单  还少一个人
according to the sheet they gave us, we're one short.

646
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,810
我数着也是  车上可能还有一个
Me, too. Maybe there's one on the bus.

647
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,480
没有  真是怪了
Nope. Weird.

648
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,170
那一定是谁数错了
Must be a miscount someplace.

649
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,170
算了  这些孩子足够了
Never mind. We got more than enough.

650
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,160
我们做得真好
We did good.

651
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,620
是啊
Indeed we did.

652
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,010
人偶师一定会满意的
The Dollmaker will be so pleased with us.

653
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,660
好  谢谢
All right, thanks.

654
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,150
没查到  你呢
Nothing. You?

655
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,110
看来哥谭没有哪家公司
Apparently, there are no companies

656
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,070
有用盘子和叉子做商标的卡车
in Gotham with trucks with a plate and a fork as their logo.

657
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,940
拿孩子当食物卖吗
Selling children for food?

658
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,250
这种事有可能吗
Is such a thing even possible?

659
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,490
我们安排了警员在所有桥梁和隧道
We've got officers searching all the trucks

660
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,080
排查每一辆卡车
on every bridge and tunnel.

661
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,720
但他们已经抢先了3小时
But they had a three-hour window.

662
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,350
我们只能祈祷他们还留在市里
We can only pray they stayed in the city.

663
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:34,180
否则  到了晚上  他们早逃到天涯海角了
If not, they could be any place on Earth by nightfall.

664
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,490
这些人渣  到底跑哪去了
Scum-sucking toads. Where are they?!

665
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,040
不是蓝盘子
It's not a blue plate.

666
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,920
也不是叉子  是三叉戟
It's not a fork, either. It's a trident.

667
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:46,680
{\an8}三叉戟国际运输

668
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,750
把他们装上船的时候
When you stow this on the ship,

669
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,630
一定留出开门的地方
make sure there's plenty of room for the doors to open.

670
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,020
船员会...
The ship's crew has...

671
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,500
闭嘴
Quiet in there!

672
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,760
行了
Hush.

673
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,780
别吵吵
Hush.

674
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,800
我的眼睛  她挠我
My eyes! She scratched me!

675
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,040
跟我来吧
Come on, follow me.

676
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,980
我看看
Let me look.

677
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,510
没事的  就是抓伤
It's nothing. It's a scratch.

678
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,870
我们带你去找医生  你很快就会没事了
We'll get you to the doctor, you'll be right as rain in no time.

679
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,810
真的
You sure?

680
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,080
-什么声音  -等等
- What was that? - Hang on.

681
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,220
哎呀
Well...

682
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,610
你真是个淘气的小姑娘
You are a very naughty little girl.

683
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,260
你叫什么
What's your name?

684
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,980
关你什么事
Why is that your business?

685
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,140
吉姆
Jim!

686
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,130
那些孩子在哪
Where are the kids?

687
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,990
在哪
Where are they?!

688
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,550
他失眠
He's not been sleeping.

689
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,890
即使睡着了也会做恶梦
And when he does, he has these nightmares.

690
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,940
现在又开始自残
Now he's hurting himself.

691
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,720
烧自己
Burning himself.

692
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,710
割伤自己
He's cutting.

693
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,990
有给他找人看看吗
Is he getting professional help?

694
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,470
心理医生吗
Oh, you mean a psychiatrist?

695
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,230
他不肯
No, no, he won't have 'em.

696
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,610
不见心理医生
No psychiatrists.

697
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,820
这是原则
That's a rule.

698
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,750
原则不是你定的吗
You make the rules, don't you?

699
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,050
你是他的监护人
You're his guardian.

700
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:15,650
布鲁斯的父亲曾严格指示过
Bruce's father gave me very firm orders

701
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,580
如果他们夫妻俩死了要怎么做
was him and his missus to die.

702
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,830
我会按他父亲的意愿把孩子带大
Now, I will raise the boy the way his father told me to raise him.

703
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,500
那是怎么做
Which is how?

704
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,530
相信他会选择好自己的人生路
Trust him to choose his own course.

705
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,780
毕竟  他是韦恩家的人
He's, after all, a Wayne.

706
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,730
听上去只会造成灾难
Sounds like a recipe for disaster.

707
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,860
你要我做什么
What do you want me to do?

708
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,260
他想要你好好劝劝我
He wants you to talk some sense into me.

709
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,780
我不是叫你别那么
Haven't I told you to stop creeping up

710
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,990
偷偷摸摸的吗  太没礼貌了
on people like that before? It's bloody rude!

711
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,320
好吧  布鲁斯
All right, then, Bruce.

712
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
跟我谈谈吧
Talk to me.

713
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,870
我没事
I'm perfectly fine.

714
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,400
阿尔弗雷德就是瞎担心
Alfred's a worrywart.

715
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,400
你怎么你的手了
What did you do to your hand?

716
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,950
烧伤了
I burned it.

717
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,250
听我说  布鲁斯
Listen to me, Bruce.

718
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,020
你经历了一件可怕的事
You've been through a terrible experience.

719
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,270
跟人谈谈可能对你有好处
Talking to someone can be very helpful.

720
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,300
你在战时一定也见过很多可怕的事
You must have seen terrible things in the war.

721
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,490
那你跟人谈你看到的事对你有好处吗
Does it... does it help you to talk about what you saw?

722
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,800
是的  有一点吧
Yes. A little.

723
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,100
你不太擅长撒谎
You're not a very good liar.

724
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,100
布鲁斯  你在自残
Bruce, you're hurting yourself.

725
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,900
我在考验自己
I'm testing myself.

726
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,570
这不一样  但是多谢你关心了
Different, but I appreciate your concern.

727
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,140
我一直在报纸上关注你的动向
I've been following your adventures in the newspapers.

728
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,020
我很为那些可怜的孩子难过
I feel very sorry for all those poor children.

729
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,080
我也是
Me, too.

730
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,410
我给你些钱  你去拿给他们
I'll give you some money to give to them.

731
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:48,800
恐怕事情不是那么办的  布鲁斯
I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, Bruce.

732
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,240
那要怎么办
What way does it work?

733
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,580
那些孩子需要有人照顾
Those children need someone who cares for them,

734
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,200
就像有人在照顾你
like you have right here.

735
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,230
这是钱买不到的
Money won't buy that.

736
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,950
我肯定能做点什么
There must be something I can do.

737
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,120
衣服呢
What about clothes?

738
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,600
他们看上去衣衫褴褛的
They all looked awfully ragged.

739
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,010
是啊
They did, didn't they?

740
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,110
经历了这么多
After all this?

741
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,020
-你们还要送我们去州北  -塞琳娜
- You're sending us upstate? - Selina...

742
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,010
是小猫
Cat.

743
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,780
小猫  即使你没有一堆通缉令  你也才13
Cat, even if you didn't have outstanding warrants, you're 13.

744
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,130
没有父母和监护人
No parents or guardians.

745
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,950
不是的  我有个妈妈
That's not true. I have a mom.

746
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,920
-这里写着她死了  -不是的
- Says here she's deceased. - That's not true.

747
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,230
她还活着  只是不知所踪
She's alive... someplace.

748
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,530
就算如此
Be that as it may,

749
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,530
我们不能让你继续流落街头
we're not allowed to put you back on the street.

750
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,400
这是为了你好
It's for your own well-being.

751
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,060
你去过州北吗
Have you been there? Upstate?

752
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,320
-是的  -那你就该知道
- Yes. - Then you know.

753
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,400
你知道那里的情况
You know.

754
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,640
去找詹姆斯・戈登警探
Go get Detective James Gordon.

755
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,420
