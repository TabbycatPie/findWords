1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,080
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,760
正好赶上吃早饭了
Oh, you're just in time for breakfast.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,950
我们也许应该少吃点
Ooh, we should probably go light on the food.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,630
直觉告诉我
Something tells me we're

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,500
撑着肚子去会不舒服的
not gonna want to do this on a full stomach.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,280
不敢相信居然真的有尸检夏令营这种东西
I can't believe there's such a thing as autopsy camp.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,390
根本没什么尸检夏令营
There is no such thing as autopsy camp.

8
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,090
我不得不骗卢克
I had to trick Luke

9
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,710
因为我其实是要带他去上交谊舞课
'cause I'm actually taking him to a ballroom-dance class.

10
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,640
他一直很抗拒
He's been resisting,

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,380
但他流淌着舞蹈家的血液
but it's in his blood.

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,750
我们邓菲家族舞蹈家辈出
I come from a long line of dancing Dunphys --

13
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,370
其实都是啦啦队的
A kick line, actually.

14
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,100
快点  我们可别晚了[救不活]
Come on, we don't want to be late,

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,410
像那个我们将看到的解剖台上的家伙
like the guy we're gonna see on the table.

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:28,990
我说得没错吧
Am I right?

17
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,470
确"尸"没错
Of corpse you are.

18
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,780
老妈  你能带我去练车吗
Hey, mom, can you take me driving?

19
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,640
我快考试了  我真的得好好练练
My test is coming up, and I really need to practice.

20
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,110
亲爱的  我也想
Oh, honey, I would,

21
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,100
但我今天有个很重要的
but I've got a big

22
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,860
橱柜和百叶窗协会会议
closets and blinds union meeting today.

23
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,960
根本没什么橱柜和百叶窗协会
There is no closets and blinds union.

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,800
跟艾丽克斯一起开车绝对是种折磨
Driving with Alex is torture.

25
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,820
她开得太慢了
She drives so slowly.

26
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,330
全世界可能只有我这个家长
I have to be the only parent

27
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,530
需要狂踩假想的油门
who slams on the imaginary gas.

28
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
我没什么事  可以带她练车
Hey, I'm not doing anything. I guess I could take her.

29
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,220
太棒了  我去检查胎压和油液位
Great! I'll go check the tire pressure and the fluid levels!

30
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,100
有意思  迫不及待了
Fun! Can't wait!

31
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,580
我马上就来
Be out in a sec!

32
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,320
好了  我提价了
Okay, my rate just went up.

33
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,500
好  但这钱既是酬劳也是封口费
All right, but this buys your time and your silence.

34
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,690
不能让艾丽克斯知道我有多讨厌陪她练车
Alex can never know how much I hate driving with her.

35
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,620
她今天倒是很急啊
Mm, she's in a hurry today.

36
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,800
那只是她九步安全测试的第一步
Oh, that's just step one of her nine-point safety test.

37
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,070
第二步是检查喇叭
Step two is checking the horn

38
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,430
确保检查喇叭没有搞坏喇叭
to make sure checking the horn didn't break the horn.

39
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,640
她就不该开车
She should never drive.

第五季 第十一集

51
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,270
别想了  你耍了我
Forget it! You tricked me!

52
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,980
很抱歉  伙计  但我的儿子
I'm sorry, buddy, but no son of mine's

53
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,380
可不能上了高中都不知道
going to high school without at least knowing

54
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,230
怎么跳方形步
how to do a proper box step.

55
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,290
相信我  会跳舞的人总能钓到妹子
Trust me, dancers always get the girls.

56
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,690
还记得《浑身是劲》里那个
Remember the great Kevin Bacon

57
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,720
很厉害的凯文・培根吗
from "Footloose"?

58
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,370
我看是"浑身傻劲"吧
More like "Footloser."

59
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,460
注意点
Careful!

60
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,580
好了  废话少说  必须去学
All right, no more talking. We're doing this.

61
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,080
有一天你会感激我的
You'll thank me someday.

62
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,840
等你找到自己的标志性舞步后就好多了
It gets better when you find your signature move!

63
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,000
他们以前总叫我"下腰之王"[扒手之王]
They used to call me "King of the dips"!

64
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,830
昨晚曼尼的派对剩下的东西
Why can't we just repurpose some of the stuff

65
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,250
怎么不能重复利用呢
from manny's party last night?

66
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,820
我们还剩半个蛋糕
We got half a cake left.

67
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,100
气球都完好无损
The balloons are fine.

68
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,020
我的两个儿子
It's bad enough that both my sons

69
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,720
同一天生日已经够糟了
have to share the same birthday.

70
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,650
他们至少得有自己的生日派对吧
At least they deserve their own party.

71
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,250
你觉得乔会介意吃昨天的蛋糕吗
You think Joe's gonna mind day-old cake?

72
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,090
他都吃不了  才长了三颗牙
He can't even eat it. He's got three teeth.

73
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,580
20年后你想吃蛋糕的时候
I'll remember that in 20 years

74
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,470
我一定不会忘了这话
when you want cake.

75
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,800
他都不知道派对是为他举办的
He doesn't even know the party's for him.

76
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,290
他懂的比你想象的多
He understands more than you think.

77
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,070
是吧  安迪
Right, Andy?

78
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,520
谁  乔老弟吗  他聪明得很
Who, F-Jo here? He is smart as a whip.

79
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,390
我们玩躲猫猫  他一半时候比我快
When we play peek-a-boo, half the time he's ahead of me.

80
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,310
又不是《诸神之战》
Not exactly "Clash of the Titans."

81
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,960
曼尼  那是谁的外套
Manny, whose coat is that?

82
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,550
昨晚派对结束后艾米・马丁落在这儿的
Amy Martin left it here last night after my party.

83
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,880
我昨晚收到了她发出的强烈信号
I was getting some pretty strong signals from her.

84
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,130
我觉得她是故意落下的
I think she did it on purpose

85
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,950
这样她就有借口再回来
so she'd have an excuse to come back.

86
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,600
又或者是因为她恨不得尽早脱身
Or because she couldn't get out fast enough.

87
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
如果她是卡通人物
If she was a cartoon,

88
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,130
早就把她的皮囊留在这儿跑路了
she'd have left her skin here.

89
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,070
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

90
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,680
意思是他高攀不上艾米
That Amy is out of his league.

91
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,870
他总是这样  最终以受伤收场
He always does this and ends up getting hurt.

92
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,680
-你得跟他谈谈  -该说什么
- You need to talk to him. - And say what?

93
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,040
告诉他追他有机会追到的女孩
Tell him to go for girls he stands a chance with.

94
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,580
我偷听到了他跟罗本的谈话
I overheard him talking to Reuben.

95
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,030
有个女孩真的很喜欢他
There's some girl that really likes him,

96
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,800
但曼尼对人家没兴趣
but of course Manny's not interested in her.

97
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,470
他非要追啦啦队长
He's got to go for the head cheerleader.

98
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,600
你怎么知道艾米是啦啦队长
How do you know that Amy's the head cheerleader?

99
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,410
这也是我偷听到的
I overheard that, too.

100
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,520
你这个看电影时经常要问
For someone whose favorite words at the movies

101
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,940
"他刚刚说什么"的人
are, "What did he say?"

102
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,700
倒是偷听得很清楚啊
you overhear pretty good.

103
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,580
没错  莉莉  我拉钩发誓
Yes, Lily, I-I pinky-promise

104
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,620
我们会赶回家参加乔的生日派对
that we'll be home in time for baby Joe's party.

105
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,380
是啊  我在跟手机拉钩啦
I am. I'm touching to the phone.

106
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,800
是啊  还有蝴蝶之吻[用睫毛刷对方脸颊]
Yeah, and butterfly kisses.

107
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,440
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

108
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,110
小女孩  容易激动
Little girls -- so excitable.

109
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,900
我正期望能有个露台  结果他们真的有
I was wishing they had a gazebo, and then they did!

110
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,940
我从小时候起就在梦想着
Ever since I was a little boy, I have dreamed --

111
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,960
梦想着在这样一个地方结婚
dreamed of getting married in a place exactly like this.

112
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,120
你们想在什么日子举行婚礼
So, what date were you looking at?

113
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,840
3月28日
March 28th.

114
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,440
那是我们第一次约会的纪念日
That's the anniversary of our first date.

115
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,010
等等  抱歉  请问这是每人的价格吗
Oh, wait, um, I'm sorry. Is this price per person?

116
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,010
是的  不包括酒水  蛋糕和伴奏
Yes, excluding alcohol, cake, and music.

117
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,860
这是什么  门诺派教徒套餐吗
What's that -- the Mennonite package?

118
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,790
你会发现我们的价格是很有竞争力的
I think you'll find our prices are competitive.

119
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,060
我已经准备好签字了
Well, I'm ready to commit.

120
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,440
小卡  小卡
Cam, Cam.

121
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,290
抱歉
I'm sorry.

122
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,140
能  能等我们一会儿吗
Can -- can we have a moment, please?

123
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,340
好  但愿他不是到了最后时刻想悔婚
Okay, well, let's hope he's not having any last-minute jitters.

124
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,640
你不是要在最后时刻悔婚吧
You're not having last-minute jitters, are you?

125
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
不  不  但那真是一大笔钱
No, no, but it's a really large deposit,

126
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,330
我想确定一下
and I want to make sure

127
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,730
我们是否真的选定这个地方了
that we're absolutely certain about this place.

128
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,480
我很确定
Well, I'm certain,

129
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,120
所有可行的地方我们都看过了
and we've looked at every possible venue.

130
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,680
而且目前胡娇对这里的点评
And Pepper was by far the least snarky

131
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,570
是最不尖酸的了
about this one.

132
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,600
那倒是
That's true.

133
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,500
他是不会轻易说出"还行"这种字眼的
He doesn't throw the word "Adequate" around lightly.

134
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,680
-好的  就定这里了  -好的
- Okay, okay, it's this place. - Okay.

135
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,030
但是不要表现得这么兴奋好吗
But stop being so excited, all right?

136
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,590
我们或许还能杀杀价
We might be able to get the price down a little bit.

137
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,330
好的  好的  冷面无情  冷面无情
Okay, okay, poker face, poker face.

138
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,410
-现在把语气情绪去掉  -冷语无情
- Yeah, now work on your poker voice. - Poker voice.

139
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,430
好的  我们确实喜欢这里
So, we do like it.

140
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,060
但还算不上钟爱
We're just not sure that we love it.

141
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,120
是  还不算钟爱
Yeah, we're not sure we love it.

142
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,460
那真让我松口气
Oh, that's a relief

143
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,510
因为刚有人打来电话
because someone just called.

144
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,640
-那个房间已经订出去了  -什么
- The room is booked. - What?!

145
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,620
不不不  等等
No, no, no! Okay, wait,

146
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,370
你是要采取强硬手段吗
are you playing hardball?

147
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,540
因为我们这是在采取强硬手段
Because we're playing hardball, too!

148
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,400
我们爱死这里了
We love it!

149
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,160
对不起
Oh, s-sorry.

150
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,750
有位打算庆祝16岁生日的女孩
A young lady planning a sweet 16

151
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,160
刚刚订下了你们的日期
just booked your date.

152
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,710
下一个可预订日期还要等上...
After that, we don't have another opening for...

153
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,440
-两个月  -不
- two months. - No.

154
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,210
不  必须是我们周年纪念日那天
No, it has to be on our anniversary.

155
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,110
等等  那房间是特蕾西・麦考伊订的吗
Wait, did Tracy Mccoy book this room?

156
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,210
特蕾西・麦考伊是我的学生
Tracy Mccoy's a student of mine.

157
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,260
好  我可能有个计划
Okay, I may have a plan.

158
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,910
我绝不接受把婚礼和"饥饿游戏"主题的
I am not having a wedding/"Hunger games"-themed

159
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:50,800
甜蜜16岁派对搞在一起
sweet 16 par--

160
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
你在敲手指头
oh, you're tapping your fingers.

161
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,530
你还真有计划了
You really do have a plan.

162
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,200
某人闻起来很香啊
Well, somebody smells good.

163
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,770
那是什么香水
What perfume is that?

164
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,980
各种香水都有
Every perfume!

165
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,660
上帝只造出了20个浑身臭汗
20 of the sweatiest, geekiest girls

166
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,380
古怪至极的女生用来污染地球
God ever fouled this planet with

167
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,560
而我一个汉子和她们每一个跳了舞
and just me dancing with all of them!

168
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,750
跳摇摆舞的时候
During the charleston,

169
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,600
我的头发还缠在了一个女生的牙套上
my hair got caught in one of their headgear!

170
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,590
第一次上课就跳摇摆舞啦
Wow, Charleston on the first day?

171
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,770
这是最后一次
Last day!

172
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,040
不能因为你会跳舞
Just because you're a dancer

173
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,630
就非得让我也去跳舞  恰恰恰
doesn't mean I have to be one, too, cha cha cha.

174
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,540
该死
Damn it!

175
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,990
我再也不会被你的谎话欺骗了
I'm never gonna fall for one of your lies again.

176
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,000
快带我去参加尸检夏令营
Just take me to autopsy camp.

177
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,800
糟糕  我该不会是要接罚单了吧
Oh, shoot. Am I gonna get a ticket?

178
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,350
要是世间有正气
If there's any justice,

179
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,240
应该让你接上一二三四张
it'll be a big one, two, three, and four.

180
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,220
该死
Damn it!

181
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,020
请出示驾驶证和汽车行驶证  谢谢
License and registration, please.

182
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,770
好的  给你
Absolutely. There you are.

183
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,260
你知道你有个尾灯坏了吗
You know one of your taillights is out?

184
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,280
不  我没注意  真是不小心啊
No, I did not. What a ding-dong!

185
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,850
在这里等着
Wait right here.

186
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,840
好的  我们就在这里等着
Will do. We'll be right here.

187
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,190
这是你对我说谎的惩罚
This is what you get for lying to me.

188
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,170
我有什么办法  我以前说什么你都接受
What choice did I have? You used to be up for anything.

189
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,470
现在不管我提出什么建议  你都反对
Now, no matter what I suggest, it's no, no, no.

190
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,740
这就叫长大成人  有自己的兴趣爱好
It's called growing up and having your own interests,

191
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,850
像你爱看的《浑身是劲》里
like the minister's daughter

192
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,290
那个大臣之女一样
in your precious "Footloose."

193
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,920
竟然用我爱看的电影来驳斥我
Wow, using my own movie against me.

194
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,610
来给这孩子鼓鼓掌吧
Let's hear it for the boy.

195
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,920
请下车
Please step out of the car.

196
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
我相信汽车尾灯坏了  不用下车看
Oh, I believe you about the taillight.

197
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,910
-下车  -好吧
- Out of the car! - Okay.

198
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,370
抱歉  但我得逮捕你
I'm sorry, but I have to place you under arrest.

199
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,610
等等  你说什么
Wait, what?!

200
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,010
你名下有一辆汽车
A car registered to you

201
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,720
累计有18次违规停车未付罚金
has accumulated 18 unpaid parking violations...

202
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,870
都是占用校内车道
all on campus drive.

203
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,910
我的天  那都是我女儿的罚单
Oh, my god, those are my daughter's tickets!

204
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,530
他为一切负责
He's got an answer for everything.

205
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,030
我得把你带到局里去
I got to take you down to the station house.

206
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,980
你可以坐在副驾驶
You can ride up front with me.

207
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,640
说真的  我不能直接把罚款交给你吗
Seriously, can't I just pay you for them now?!

208
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,930
先生  你得去局里交
At the station house, sir.

209
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,800
我们可以至少绕开中土漫画店
Can we at least not drive by middle earth comics

210
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,990
和蹦床世界吗
and trampoline world?!

211
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,100
这里的人民是很敬仰我的
People look up to me in this town!

212
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,300
不  亲爱的  卢克没事
No, honey, Luke's fine.

213
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,650
他们不接受信用卡吗
And they won't take a credit card?

214
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,010
不接受  1600元  只收现金
No, it's $1,600, cash only.

215
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,930
可是  亲爱的  今天是周日
But, honey, it's Sunday.

216
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,140
我在自动提款机上只能提几百块钱
I can only get a few hundred bucks from the ATM.

217
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,800
先生  您的通话时间到了
Sir, your time's up.

218
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,990
亲爱的  使用应急现金吧
Honey, just use the emergency cash, okay?

219
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,700
-时间到  -可是  菲尔
- Tick-Tock. -Uh, b-but, Phil --

220
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,880
-我得挂了  -不  亲爱的
- Got to go! - No, honey --

221
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,550
藏钱的地方我忘了  菲尔
I forgot the hiding place! Phil?

222
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,100
菲尔在家里藏了一千块钱
Phil has $1,000 hidden in the house,

223
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,110
他还编了一套疯狂的助记法
and he's made up a crazy mnemonic device

224
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,230
用于记住藏钱的地点
to remember the location,

225
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,790
他每个月都会变换藏钱的地点来防备坏人
which he changes every month to stay ahead of the bad guys.

226
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,980
哪有什么坏人
What bad guys?

227
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,150
搜刮的刮和傻瓜的瓜音似
"Loot" rhymes with "Coot,"

228
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,810
会把我们带到
which takes us to...

229
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,870
你祖父的这张照片
this picture of your grandfather.

230
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,630
钞票的票比较像飘飘的飘
"Moola" sounds like "Coola."

231
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,300
这算个词吗
Not a word.

232
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,220
钱就藏在空调的通风口
Money is in the air-conditioning vent.

233
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,310
这件事马上就能解决了  伙计
This will all be over soon, buddy.

234
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,750
最后再给我笑一个
Just give me one last smile!

235
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,730
你也笑一个
You too.

236
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,890
你妈已经带着钱上路了  别担心
Mom's already on her way with the money, okay? Don't worry!

237
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,660
上帝啊  我不想进那里
Oh, my god, I don't want to go in there!

238
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,560
你要进的是这里
You're going in here.

239
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,120
我也不想进这里
I don't want to go in here!

240
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,830
好了  这是索菲工作的地方
Okay. This is where Sophie works.

241
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,770
她是戴帽子的那个女孩儿
She's the one in the hat.

242
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,260
-明白  -特蕾西在楼上工作
- Copy that. - Tracy works upstairs.

243
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,330
我们半小时后美食街见  怎么样
We'll meet in the food court in 30 minutes. Sound like a plan?

244
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,620
还行  不确定是敲着手指想出来的计划
A plan, not sure if it's a finger-drumming plan.

245
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,590
快过去吧
Get in there.

246
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,720
我的两个学生  特蕾西和索菲是闺蜜
Two of my students, Tracy and Sophie, BFFs,

247
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,600
原本计划一起举办甜蜜16岁生日派对
were planning on having a joint sweet 16 together

248
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,390
但她们为了一个叫罗德尼的男生争风吃醋
until they got in a fight over a boy, Rodney.

249
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,690
现在特蕾西计划在马车房
Now Tracy is planning on having her own party

250
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,890
举办她自己的派对
at the carriage house.

251
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,250
那是我们的位置  我们的日子
Our venue, our date.

252
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,630
所以我们的办法是跟两人谈话让她们和好
So, our solution -- talk to them, patch things up

253
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,390
这样她们就能在原定地点
so that they have their party together again

254
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,910
一起办派对了
at the original location.

255
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:04,980
朋友间为了男孩子争风吃醋
Friends fighting over a boy --

256
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,670
对付这种事我们还是略知一二的
something we know a thing or two about.

257
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,930
当然通常都是男同志们  而不是少女们
Of course, usually it's gay men, not teenage girls,

258
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,920
所以我们对策略的改变是  丝毫不变
so we will have to adjust our approach just a -- not at all.

259
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,670
我不知道
I don't know.

260
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,110
需要帮忙吗
Uh, may I help you?

261
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,010
是的  索菲
Mm, yeah, uh, Sophie.

262
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,240
我想给我侄女买点儿东西
Um, I'm looking for something for my niece.

263
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,840
她最近很不开心
She's been really bummed out lately --

264
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,150
跟最好的朋友吵架了  所以我
fight with her best friend -- so I'm just --

265
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,410
我想让她高兴起来
I'm trying to cheer her up.

266
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,080
你真好
That's so nice.

267
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,050
是啊  她总跟我说
Yeah, she's always saying to me,

268
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,450
米奇叔叔  你真酷  又那么时髦
"Uncle Mitch, you're so cool. You're so rad.

269
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,690
我真喜欢跟你讨论我的问题
I'm so glad I talk to you about my problems."

270
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,880
我就是很了解那个年纪的孩子
You know, I just -- I really get kids that age.

271
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,390
她  她快到16岁了
You know, she's -- she's almost 16, so...

272
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,770
我也快到16岁了
I'm almost 16.

273
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,670
太巧了
Crazy.

274
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,250
特蕾西
Tracy?

275
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,890
特蕾西・麦考伊
Tracy McCoy?

276
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,600
塔克老师  你好啊
Mr. Tucker, hi.

277
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,510
我都不知道你已经到了可以工作的年龄了
I didn't know you were old enough to have a job.

278
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,420
我直到16岁才有了份工作
I didn't have a job until I was 16.

279
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,260
我就快到16岁了
Well, I'm almost 16, so...

280
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,390
真的啊
Crazy!

281
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,410
我的天啊  我还记得那个时候
Oh, my gosh, I remember back then.

282
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,040
我和我的朋友们过得特别开心
My friends and I had so much fun,

283
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
如果我们没有为了一些愚蠢的事情
well, when we weren't arguing

284
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,430
争吵的话  比如派对还有...
about silly things like parties and...

285
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,520
行了  镜子看得够多了
Okay, that's a lot of mirror looking,

286
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,430
我这么爱照镜子的人都嫌多
and that's me saying that.

287
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,700
很好  很好
Good, good.

288
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,210
这巡航速度真不错
Nice cruising speed.

289
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,700
看啊  那有个慢跑的人
Oh, look, there's that jogger.

290
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,860
我们现在在领跑呢
Now we're in the lead.

291
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,280
讽刺挖苦这件事上你能踩下刹车吗
Can we put the brakes on the sarcasm?

292
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,470
刹车早被踩坏了
They're worn out.

293
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,290
喂  妈
Hey, mom.

294
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,740
海莉  你给我听着
Haley, listen to me.

295
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,050
因为你有一堆停车罚单没按时交罚款
You did not pay a bunch of parking tickets,

296
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,070
你爸现在进监狱了
and now your father is in jail.

297
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,440
而我得去把他保释出来
And I have to go bail him out

298
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,220
但我得先找到一大笔现金
just as soon as I can get my hands on a giant pile of cash.

299
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,850
现金  灰烬
Cash -- ash!

300
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,750
天啊
Oh! Oh, god.

301
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,180
好多绒毛
Oh! That was furry!

302
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,270
你惹上大麻烦了
You are in so much trouble.

303
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,520
你觉得我不知道吗
Oh, don't you think I know that?!

304
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,700
我该怎么办
What am I gonna do?!

305
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
你会得到应有的惩罚
You're going to get what you deserve.

306
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,530
停车违规仅次于行车违规
A parking violation is second only to a moving violation,

307
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,870
行车违规会被剥夺驾驶特权
which is grounds for the loss of a driving privilege.

308
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,480
是特权  不是普通权利
Privilege, not a right.

309
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,540
天啊  你闭嘴吧
Oh, my god, shut up!

310
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,490
这就是为什么妈付我钱给你做陪驾
This is why mom pays me to drive with you!

311
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,250
什么
What?

312
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,600
你以为她是从哪里打来的电话
Where do you think she's calling me from --

313
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,190
衣柜和盲人协会吗
the closet and blinds union?

314
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,190
[Blinds有"百叶窗"和"盲人"两个意思]

315
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,940
造衣柜的工人和盲人怎么会
Why would closet workers and blind people

316
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,280
在一起办协会
even have a union together?!

317
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,380
用脑子想想吧
Think!

318
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,720
打扰一下  服务生
Excuse me, waiter.

319
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,970
能给我介绍一下海鲜牛排套餐吗
Could you please tell me about the surf and turf?

320
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,250
龙虾先生说
Mr. Lobster says...

321
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,070
特别难吃
"It's terrible!"

322
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,690
而牛说
While Mr. Cow goes...

323
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,810
我觉得你还是吃意大利面吧
"I think you should probably just have the pasta."

324
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:18,910
爸爸
Dada.

325
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,350
不  不  不对  宝宝
No, no, no, little man.

326
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,790
在那里喝小酒的才是你爸爸
That's your dada right there with the drinky.

327
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,200
解释过多
Over-explaining.

328
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
别难过  他只是在发声
Don't feel bad. He's just making sounds.

329
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,220
他可能都不知道"爸"字是什么意思
He may not even know what the "D" word means.

330
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,620
我没事  他才1岁
I'm fine. He's 1.

331
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,570
我见过他尿到自己的照片上还在笑
I've watched him pee into his own face and smile.

332
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,080
你好啊  亲爱的
Hola, mi amor.

333
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,570
我想跟你聊聊
I wanted to talk to you.

334
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,570
你在干什么
What are you doing?

335
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,180
我打算用我自己的浪漫招数
I decided to top Amy's little "Forgotten Coat" trick

336
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,870
给艾米忘记外套的小花招锦上添花
with a romantic gesture of my own.

337
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,620
你看
You see --

338
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,660
是的  关于艾米
Yes, about Amy...

339
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,570
我知道我不了解她
I know that I don't know her,

340
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,290
可她看起来就像你以前喜欢过的那些女孩
But she seems like some of those girls that you have liked,

341
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,490
可她们基本没有
but they haven't always--

342
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,540
你可能不了解她  但我很了解
You may not know her, but I do.

343
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,880
我去看了她的Facebook页面
I went on her Facebook page,

344
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,350
然后在她大衣的每个口袋里
and I put one of her favorite things

345
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,850
都放了一样她喜欢的东西
in each of the pockets of her coat.

346
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,480
所以当她摸到里面时
So when she reaches inside--

347
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,050
就会发现一小盒荷兰巧克力
she'll find a small box of Dutch chocolates.

348
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:05,900
很窝心  可是
Sweet, but --

349
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,910
覆盆子狂想曲唇彩  有人想要吗
Raspberry rhapsody lip gloss, anyone?

350
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,120
我的最爱啊  可我还是觉得
My favorite, but I still wonder--

351
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,320
快看  天堂美浴浴盐
Hello, heavenly soak bath salts.

352
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,800
她还会发现什么
What next will she find?!

353
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,730
不过是一支山谷百合幽香烛台
Only a lily of the valley scented candle.

354
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,060
我的大爱
I love it!

355
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,180
真希望她口袋再多点
Oh, I wish she had more pockets!

356
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,630
"美元"跟"臭"音近
"Bucks" rhymes with "Nyuks" --

357
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,220
《三个臭皮匠》
Three Stooges.

358
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,480
混蛋
Damn it!

359
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,820
"皮夹子"  "塑料丝球"
"Wampum," "Pom-pom" --

360
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,130
啦啦队服
Cheerleading costume.

361
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,610
拜托  天呐  真的要这么难么
Come on. Oh, my god, really?

362
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,820
"银行"  "沉船"
"Bank," "Sank" --

363
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,770
《泰坦尼克号》电影的小说版
Novelization of the movie "Titanic."

364
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:44,750
那我们为什么还要留着这东西
Then why do we keep that thing?!

365
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,430
菲尔  当然了
Oh, Phil, of course!

366
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,970
显然是因为"钱"音近于...
Of course, because "Dough" rhymes with--

367
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,860
管它呢
I don't care.

368
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,840
管它呢
I don't care.

369
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,170
你好啊  小家伙
Hi, buddy.

370
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,950
我是谁
Who am I?

371
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,370
我是谁
Who am I?

372
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,340
来吧
Come on.

373
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,120
他是你爸爸
He's your dad.

374
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,550
没错  他是你爸爸
That's right. He's your dad.

375
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,790
你好  爸爸  你好  爸爸
Hi, dad. Hi, dad.

376
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,670
你可以的
You can do it.

377
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,080
加油  叫爸爸
Come on, say, "Dad."

378
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,460
叫呀
Come on.

379
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,830
叫呀
Come on!

380
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,580
安迪
Andy!

381
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,490
索菲那边进展如何了
Hey. How'd it go with Sophie?

382
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,830
我尽力了  但我觉得她还不能原谅对方
I did my best, but I don't think she's ready to forgive.

383
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,050
该死
Oh, damn it.

384
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,660
是啊  我们完蛋了
I know. We're screwed.

385
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,260
是啊  多亏了索菲的"贡献"
Yeah, thanks a lot, Sophie.

386
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,360
特蕾西确实有点过分了
Well, Tracy really was out of line.

387
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,960
-怪她吗  -是啊
- Was she? - Yeah.

388
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,660
是索菲一如既往太小题大作了吧
Or was Sophie, per usual, being a big drama queen?

389
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,720
小题大作吗
Drama queen?

390
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,090
不  特蕾西还散播谣言
No, Tracy was spreading rumors

391
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,000
说索菲的男友还和玛雅在一起
that Sophie's boyfriend was still into Maya.

392
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,900
那不是谣言
They weren't rumors.

393
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,550
她直接从别人那里听说的
She heard it directly from someone

394
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,550
那人看到玛雅和罗德尼在码头手牵手
who saw Maya and Rodney holding hands at the pier.

395
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,000
小卡  谁看见的啊  是黛娜
Cam, who? Dana!

396
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,040
她的话可信吗
Yeah, like she can be trusted.

397
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,370
简直是艾登事件重演
This is Aidan all over again.

398
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,840
米奇尔  是特蕾西的短信
Mitchell, it's from Tracy.

399
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,970
塔克老师  谢谢你
"Mr.Tucker, thank you.

400
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,320
我和索菲谈过了
"Talked to Sophie.

401
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,330
我们还是会一起办派对
Party's back on."

402
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,110
你不是开玩笑吧
Are you kidding me?

403
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,230
天呐  你真是个天才
Oh, my gosh, you're an evil genius!

404
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,430
你才是  知道吗
You are! You know what?

405
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,690
我觉得特蕾西敢于认错真的很棒  真的
I give Tracy a lot of credit for admitting she was wrong. I do.

406
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,610
是啊  即使错的是索菲
Yeah, even though it was Sophie's fault.

407
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,650
-不  -怎么了
- No! - Hmm? What?

408
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,280
他们还要用我们的会场
They're still using our venue!

409
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,410
不  没搞错吧
No! Are you kidding me?!

410
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,260
-太糟糕了  -真的吗
- This is so frustrating! - Really?

411
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,250
你确定你真是这么想的吗
Are you sure that's how you feel,

412
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,190
还是再给你点时间好好想想
or do you need a little more time to think about it?

413
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,470
貌似你有话想说
Sounds like you're trying to make a point there.

414
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,730
我真惊讶你这么快就反应过来了
Wow, I'm surprised you picked up on that so quick.

415
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,390
是啊  你肯定是在暗示什么
Yeah, you're definitely dancing around something.

416
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,780
我觉得跟速度有关
I feel like it's speed-related.

417
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,850
我们没能订上马车房就是因为
Yeah, we lost the carriage house because you,

418
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,500
你一如既往地
true to form,

419
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,110
不能及时做出决定
couldn't make a timely decision.

420
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,250
我们只是出去讨论了两秒钟
We were out of the room for two second--

421
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,590
"一如既往"是什么意思
What is this "True to form" business?

422
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,510
里奇戴尔路28号院
28 Richdale Road.

423
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,120
天呐  你在跟我开玩笑吗
Oh, my god, are you kidding me?

424
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,900
你在我们的梦想家园面前犹犹豫豫
You hemmed and hawed over our dream house,

425
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,200
现在别人正在属于我们的角落里吃早饭
and now somebody else is eating breakfast in our nook!

426
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,230
我需要一个周末来考虑一下
I needed the weekend!

427
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,710
我从没想像过自己住在牧场
I never saw myself in a ranch!

428
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:49,630
那拉斯维加斯那次呢
And what about Las Vegas

429
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,610
你无法决定要不要去看表演
when you couldn't quite commit to the show?

430
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,530
不不  别提那件事
No. No, no, don't.

431
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,840
不不  没关系啊
No, no, no, it's fine.

432
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,870
我们可以下次再看
We'll see them next time,

433
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,370
等那只白虎不咬罗伊的时候就去看
just as soon as that tiger un-eats Roy.

434
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,600
我喜欢那个标志
I love the sign!

435
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,150
我不太确定
Uh, I'm not sure.

436
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,420
一开始我觉得用一点鲜艳的颜色
First, I thought just a little accent of color

437
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,490
就可以了  可现在我在考虑加上气球
was all it needed, but now I'm thinking balloons.

438
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,210
杰  你更喜欢哪个
Jay, what do you like better--

439
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,700
色彩[口音]还是气"球"
the accent or the balloons?

440
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,350
遇见你之后  我一直在问自己这问题
I've been asking myself that since I met you.

441
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,910
我可以这么说吗
Can I just say,

442
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,760
我希望自己的恋爱中也有这样风趣的调侃
I want this type of playful banter in my relationship.

443
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,930
去别处说去
As long as you say it someplace else.

444
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,190
真好笑
Good one.

445
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,390
你在干什么  他们马上就到了
What are you doing? They're gonna be here any moment.

446
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,320
我在看曼尼的班级纪念册
I've been combing through Manny's yearbook.

447
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,400
我发现了几个他可能有机会钓到的女孩
I found a few girls he might have a shot with.

448
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,870
你知道丽莎・内格尔脖子以下长什么样吗
Happen to know what Lisa Nagel's like from the neck down?

449
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,910
我没跟他讲你要我说的话
I didn't tell him what you told me to say.

450
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,320
什么  为什么啊
What? Why?

451
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,320
因为他告诉了我艾米来了以后他的打算
Because he told me what he's going to do when Amy comes here,

452
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,920
是个很浪漫的计划
and it's beautiful.

453
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,570
我觉得他成功的机会比你想的要大
I think he has a better chance than you think.

454
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,870
他知道怎么跟女孩子说话
He knows how to talk to girls.

455
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,520
他只知道怎么跟一个女孩子说话
He knows how to talk to a girl

456
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,220
就是你
-- you.

457
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,290
我希望你有他的心脏的近照
I hope you have a recent picture of his heart.

458
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,080
这样碎了以后可以照着拼回去
You're gonna need it putting the pieces back together.

459
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,630
我来开
I'll get it!

460
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,870
你好  曼小尼
Hey, Mandrake.

461
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,290
菲尔  我听说了你被抓的事
Hi, Phil. I heard about jail.

462
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,960
-你还好吗  -挺不容易的
- How are you doing? - It was rough.

463
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,850
在那个冰冷的笼子里
Stayed in that cold cell

464
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,210
等了太久  因为我可爱的...
a lot longer than I needed to thanks to my lovely --

465
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,590
你的助记法太扯了  菲尔
Your system is ridiculous, Phil.

466
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,990
其实很简单
Quite simple, actually!

467
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,350
"钱袋"跟"脑袋"发音很像
"Cheddah" rhymes with "Hedda."

468
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,080
你脑袋枕在什么上边  枕头啊
Where do you rest your head on? Your pilla!

469
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,670
-不是吗  哥们  -我没有哥们
- Help me out, buddy. - I have no buddy.

470
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,290
可是  卢克
But... Luke?

471
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,510
我来开
I'll get it!

472
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,060
你别再想了好不好
Would you please just let it go?

473
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,190
我早就不想了
I did let it go immediately.

474
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,130
你才是那个纠结的人
You're the one who hesitated,

475
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,020
你对待任何事都是这样
like you do with everything.

476
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,700
已经说了一路了
The whole way here.

477
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,080
爸  在你发火之前  我...
Dad, before you get mad, I'm --

478
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,740
"我发火之前"是在几小时之前
Oh, we passed "Before I get mad" hours ago

479
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,350
当我因为你被关单人禁闭的时候
when I was sitting in solitary for your crime!

480
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,790
因为里面没有其他人所以才说单人禁闭
It was only solitary because no one else was in there.

481
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,870
你给海莉钱让她陪我练车
You paid Haley to take me driving?

482
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,910
是的
Uh -- that's right.

483
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,220
海莉都告诉我了
Haley told me everything!

484
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,430
你编造了一个工会
You made up a fake union

485
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,600
就为了不来陪我吗
just so you wouldn't have to be with me?!

486
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,510
艾丽克斯  对不起
Alex, I am so sorry.

487
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,920
海莉  我那么信任你
Haley, I trusted you.

488
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,100
信任这个家里的人没有好下场
Good luck trusting anyone in this family,

489
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,290
尤其是爸爸
especially dad.

490
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,730
通常我带你去参加你原本不愿去的活动时
Usually when I drag you kicking and screaming to something,

491
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,050
过后你都会感谢我
you thank me afterwards.

492
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,410
这次我错了
This time, I was wrong.

493
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,480
他做了什么
What did he do?

494
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,200
他骗我去上舞蹈课
He lied me into a dance class.

495
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,930
卢克  对不起
Luke, I am so sorry.

496
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,060
海莉  你有大麻烦了
Haley, you are in so much trouble!

497
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,170
超大麻烦
So much trouble!

498
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,010
别把这事说成她的错
Stop trying to make this her fault!

499
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,710
什么样的父母会骗他们的小孩
What kind of parents lie to their kids?!

500
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,860
就是  这又是什么教育方式
Yeah, what kind of lesson is that to teach all of this?

501
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,850
我说认真的  有些时候我想
Yeah, seriously, sometimes I want --

502
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,160
你们都不知道事情的真相
Hey, neither one of you knows the whole story.

503
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,630
拜托
Ah, please.

504
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,580
让我告诉他们事实
Let me tell them the truth.

505
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,040
艾丽克斯
Alex, the real reason

506
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,230
妈妈不想教你开车的真正原因
mom doesn't want to teach you to drive

507
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,190
是因为她不希望你拿到驾照
is because she doesn't want you getting your license.

508
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,140
-什么  -仔细想想
- What? - Think about it.

509
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,940
开车载你是妈妈最喜欢的和你共处的时间
Mom driving you around is kind of her favorite time with you.

510
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:34,470
这是唯一你不在埋头看书
It's the only place where your nose isn't buried in a book

511
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,630
而她可以跟你说上话的地方
and she can actually talk to you.

512
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,830
你拿到的是驾照
Sure, you're getting your license,

513
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,020
她失去的却是女儿
but she's losing her little girl.

514
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,260
妈  这是真的吗
Mom, is that true?

515
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,980
过来
Come here.

516
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,140
爸爸对你撒谎的唯一原因是
And the only reason dad lied to you is...

517
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,000
我能告诉他吗  爸
Should I tell him, dad?

518
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,900
说吧
Fine.

519
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,000
爸爸在大学里是个超级书呆子
Dad was a huge nerd in college.

520
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,360
他约了妈妈快十次都被拒绝了
He asked mom out like 10 times, and she always said no.

521
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,960
最终  他说  只要你做一件事
Finally, he said, "I'll never bug you again

522
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,900
-我就再也不烦你了  -只要一件事
- if you do one thing." - Just one.

523
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,760
-和我跳舞  -只是跳舞
- "Dance with me." - Just dance.

524
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,430
他抱着她在舞池旋转
He spun her around on the floor

525
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,380
用肢体语言表达他无法
and expressed himself with his body

526
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,410
-说出口的情感  -很美好
- in a way he never could with words. - That's beautiful.

527
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,720
妈妈才终于看到了
Mom finally saw the dad

528
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,400
我们深爱的这个爸爸的优点
that we all know and love.

529
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,690
所以你想教会我这招
And you wanted to give that to me?

530
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,950
过来
Come here.

531
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,870
大家过来吃蛋糕啦
Everybody, come for cake!

532
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,750
我们可以晚点再讨论对我的惩罚
We can discuss my punishment later.

533
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,390
她是跟我们学的吗
Did she learn that from us?

534
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,550
那个可学不会  是天份
That can't be taught. It is a gift.

535
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,660
她还是那样
Yeah, she's still doing it,

536
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,100
眼泛桃花地跟着我
following me around all moony-eyed.

537
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,600
她怎么就不明白我的意思呢
She just won't get the message.

538
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,800
不过好消息是  艾米马上就过来了
But on the bright side, Amy's on her way over.

539
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,850
我们得谈谈
We need to talk.

540
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,270
我得挂了  罗本
Got to go, Reuben.

541
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,720
-什么事  -关于你的感情生活
- What's up? - It's about your love life.

542
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,870
有好多人在呢  杰
A lot of people here, Jay.

543
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,690
这是我正式对你进行介入指导
Consider it an intervention.

544
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,620
这个艾米的事有点不太靠谱
Now, this whole Amy thing is going nowhere,

545
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,250
不过听起来有另外一个女孩很喜欢你
but it sounds like you have a girl that really likes you.

546
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,260
我知道这可能不是你最想要的
Now, I know it's not everything you want.

547
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,980
可能她体态有点偏胖
M-maybe she's a little thick in the middle.

548
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,180
我也不知道
I don't know.

549
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,310
可是你何不给她一个机会呢
But why don't you give her a try?

550
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,500
所以你觉得我应该选择那个女生吗
So you think that's the girl I should go for?

551
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,050
很明显她超喜欢你
She's obviously crazy about you.

552
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,190
你了解她别的方面吗
I mean, what else do you even know about her?

553
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,030
你好啊曼尼
Hi, Manny.

554
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,700
她只有六岁而且跟我有血缘关系
Well, she's 6 and related to me.

555
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,910
我还需要继续说吗
Shall I go on?

556
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,090
这倒是解释了今早她为什么
Okay, that explains all the outfits

557
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,220
那么在意自己穿什么
she rejected this morning.

558
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,100
我的观点还是没变
The point remains.

559
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,900
你应该把眼光放低一些
You could lower your sights a little.

560
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,410
好吧  还是要继续这个话题
Good, we're still talking about this.

561
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:18,850
放过他吧
Ay, leave him alone.

562
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,830
艾米来了一定会喜欢她外套里的惊喜的
When Amy comes, she's going to love her coat surprise.

563
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,800
艾米是谁
Who's Amy?

564
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,380
就是杰认为对我没兴趣的那个女生
This girl Jay doesn't think is into me,

565
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,470
但是她把外套留在这里了
but she left her coat here.

566
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,750
她这么做还有什么别的原因
Why else would a person do that?

567
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,510
这么说的话我爱死丹尼斯餐厅了
By that logic, I love Denny's.

568
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,930
即使她现在不喜欢我
Even if she's not into me right away,

569
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,880
难道以后就没有可能日久生情吗
isn't it possible she could fall for me over time?

570
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,800
没有  有种东西叫化学反应
No, there's a thing called chemistry.

571
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,260
真有感觉的话一下就知道了
People know right away.

572
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,830
也不一定
Not necessarily.

573
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,180
我当时也不知道自己会喜欢你
I didn't know immediately that I liked you.

574
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,730
当然也许不是在一开始就知道
Well, maybe not the first minute.

575
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,730
用了一个月吧
One month.

576
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,120
一个月  天哪
A month? Yikes.

577
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,090
我支持曼尼
I'm with Manny.

578
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,770
有些人会相信自己的直觉
Some people can trust their instincts

579
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,040
然后全身心地投入
and leap in with both feet.

580
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,740
但有些人则需要慢慢来
Others need to take their time.

581
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,480
好吧  小卡想说的是
Okay, what Cam is so subtly implying

582
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,140
他在一开始就知道要和我在一起
is that he knew instantly with me

583
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,090
但我就像往常一样需要时间做决定
while I, as usual, took my sweet time.

584
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,920
但你知道吗
Well, guess what.

585
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,330
其实我从第一眼就认定你了
I knew instantly with you.

586
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,480
怎么样
How about that?

587
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,490
-事实上是我没有  -好吧
- Actually, I didn't. - Okay, well, yes,

588
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,210
如果算上那次糟糕的早午餐
if you count that one disastrous brunch, then --

589
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,600
-两个月吧  -两个月
- two months. - Two months?!

590
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,650
-是啊  -天哪
- Mm-hmm. - Yikes!

591
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,990
我站在杰这边
Well, I'm in the Jay camp.

592
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,050
当你遇到了对的人  一下就知道
When you meet the right person, bang!

593
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,580
我就是这种  多久
That's what happened with -- How long?

594
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,130
六个月
Uh...six months?

595
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,870
六个月  天哪
Six months -- Yikes.

596
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:17,430
但你那时候都怀...跟我订婚了
But you were preg-- tically engaged to me by then.

597
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,950
转得漂亮  爸爸
Mm, nice save, dad.

598
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,640
等等
Wait a minute.

599
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,950
我以为他邀请你跳舞以后
I thought you fell in love with him

600
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,890
你就爱上他了呢
after he danced with you.

601
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,580
那就是六个月的时候啊
And that was six months in.

602
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,730
你为什么等那么久才邀请我跳舞  菲尔
Why did it take you so long to dance with me, Phil?

603
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,400
我也不知道  克莱尔
I don't know, Claire.

604
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
按理说我早该那么做了
You'd think I would've gotten to it by then

605
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,110
因为我们那时都同居了
since we lived together.

606
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,270
对不起  我一直在抱怨你拖慢了进度
I'm sorry. I've been berating you about dragging your feet, and,

607
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,390
但在我们之间的事上
and when it comes to us,

608
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,750
我才是更犹豫不决的人
I'm even more hesitate-y than --

609
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,680
不不  这是好事
No, no, this is great because

610
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,130
这就是说我们的纪念日
that makes our real anniversary

611
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,700
其实比原本以为的要晚两个月
two months later when we were both sure.

612
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,920
我们还是可以在马车房举行婚礼
We can still book the carriage house for our wedding.

613
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,960
天哪  你是在给他们打电话吗
Oh, my gosh, are you calling them?

614
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,190
-是的  -太好了
- Yes! - Yes!

615
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,190
不过  我
Although, I-I am --

616
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,430
-打给他们  -好的
- Call them. - Okay.

617
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,110
所以你那时其实一直跟这个家伙同居
So, you were living with this guy the whole time...

618
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,030
-杰  -多可爱
- Jay! - Aww, how cute!

619
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,280
他想吃蛋糕
He wants cake!

620
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,490
不  不  认真听
No, no, listen, listen, listen!

621
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,610
他在说什么
What's he saying?

622
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,700
-杰  -杰
- Jay. - Jay!

623
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,350
他在说"杰"
He's saying, "Jay"!

624
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,750
他认识我
He knows me!

625
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,410
"杰"这个字比"爸爸"要难说
And that "J" word, that's harder to say than "Dada"!

626
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,360
他真是个天才  过来
He's a genius. Come here.

627
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,480
她来了
She's here!

628
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,540
时机到了  曼尼
This is it, Manny!

629
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,800
把她拿下  伙计
Go get her, buddy!

630
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,380
听着  孩子
Hey, hey, hey, listen, kid.

631
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,920
你之前说有些人需要时间
Y-you might've been right about some people

632
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,260
才能缓过神来也许是对的
needing a little more time before they come around.

633
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,660
你看这小宝贝就是这样的
I mean, look at peanut here.

634
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,630
祝你好运  曼尼
Good luck, Manny.

635
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,010
谢了  杰
Thanks, Jay.

636
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,880
你用了六个月才成功是吧  菲尔
So, it took you six months, huh, Phil?

637
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,190
我能接受六个月
I can do six months.

638
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,140
我会等你的
I'll be here!

639
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,670
我不喜欢这种感觉
I'm not loving this.

640
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,820
他的门还是关着
His door is still closed.

641
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,610
他在里面干什么
What is he doing in there?

642
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,260
我觉得我们都清楚他在里面干什么
I think we both know what he's doing in there.

643
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,730
他都弄了几个小时了
He's been at it for hours.

644
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,350
我年轻的时候也是这样
That's how I was at his age.

645
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,720
他会虚脱的
He's gonna wear himself out.

646
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
你应该跟他谈谈
You should talk to him.

647
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,300
我不想让他难为情
I don't want to embarrass him.

648
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,880
-那就先敲门  -你说得对
- So, knock first. - Maybe you're right.

649
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,810
我怕他做得方式不对  把自己弄伤
I don't want him doing it wrong and getting hurt.

650
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,950
卢克
Luke?

651
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,950
我进来了
I'm coming in.

652
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,680
伙计  兄弟
Hey, man. Buddy!

653
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,340
爸爸  快出去
Dad?! Get out of here!

654
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,610
别难为情儿子  这很正常
Don't be embarrassed, son. It's perfectly natural!

655
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,700
出去
Get out!
