1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:02,335
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:05,304
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:08,757
<i>To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:11,911
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:15,515
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:17,417
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:20,787
<i>but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,157
<i>and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:27,293
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:28,995
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:28,997 --> 00:00:30,463
<i>Iris's mom is alive.</i>

12
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,365
And you thought you could pay me

13
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,033
to walk away
from my own daughter.

14
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:36,035
Last time you walked away
for free.

15
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,403
When you created
the singularity,

16
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,938
you also created a breach...

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,840
<i>a portal connecting
our two earths.</i>

18
00:00:40,842 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>You really think he's just</i>

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,610
<i>bringing these guys here
to kill me?</i>

20
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:45,378
Zoom is obsessed
with destroying me.

21
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,013
Now he wants to destroy you.

22
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:51,050
I'm starting to perceive
things... horrible things.

23
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,020
We have to merge the inner
and outer event horizons

24
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:55,722
by separating in the eye of it.

25
00:00:55,724 --> 00:00:56,756
No!

26
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,828
Ronnie died saving me,
and I'm so sorry.

27
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,229
No, no, no, get back.
Come here.

28
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:06,432
Professor Stein,
can you hear me?

29
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:11,838
<i>Everyone secretly thinks</i>

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,173
<i>they've figured out
what their life</i>

31
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:14,807
<i>is gonna be like,</i>

32
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:18,044
<i>but what no one ever considers
is that life has</i>

33
00:01:18,046 --> 00:01:22,015
<i>its own plans for you,
whether you like them or not.</i>

34
00:01:22,017 --> 00:01:24,617
<i>And so you're left
with a choice.</i>

35
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:28,955
<i>You can either embrace
the change and move forward,</i>

36
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>or fight it, and be left behind.</i>

37
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,960
Dude!
I knew you could do it.

38
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:38,565
That was some touchdown, man.
You won us the game!

39
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:41,634
Hey, no, man.
<i>We</i> won us the game.

40
00:01:41,636 --> 00:01:43,596
Hey, that's not what
the cheerleaders were saying.

41
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,271
Oh, yeah? For real?
A'ight.

42
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,107
Jefferson, great game.

43
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:49,642
Hey, thanks, coach.

44
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:51,911
I'm not the only one
that noticed.

45
00:01:51,913 --> 00:01:54,247
Lot of scouts in the stands
tonight,

46
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:55,949
and after that touchdown,

47
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,318
they all pulled out
their cell phones.

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,687
You're gonna get your pick
of colleges, son.

49
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,788
You really think so?

50
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,690
I know so.

51
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:06,926
You get home and celebrate
with your mom.

52
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,174
Everybody, run!

53
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:30,550
Hey, hey, come on, man,
I got you!

54
00:02:32,854 --> 00:02:35,088
We gotta get inside the tunnel!

55
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,028
Aah!

56
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:47,461

57
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:49,969
Hold him steady!

58
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,237
He's dropping out.

59
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,404
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

60
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,572
Cisco, we're losing him!

61
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,874
Got it!

62
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:06,218
Oh, Dios mio.
Thank God.

63
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,586
He's getting worse.

64
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,588
Look, I did what I could
to re-engineer

65
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,090
Doctor Wells's
original stabilizer

66
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,491
to quell the reaction,
but I don't know

67
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,026
what he used as a power source.

68
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,628
Best I could find was
the one from his wheelchair.

69
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,396
And how long will that last?

70
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,198
Well, that's the problem,
is we had already used up

71
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,333
most of its energy trying
to dampen the metas' powers

72
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,737
during our little rogue air trip
with Weather Wizard and company.

73
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,438
I think we got a few days tops.

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,339
And he's stuck in bed?

75
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,841
Yeah, when he wakes up,

76
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:30,509
I'm gonna transfer
the stabilizer to this,

77
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,511
give him a power cane,
get him moving.

78
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,547
We gotta figure out
a way to save him.

79
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,516
I think I might know
how to do that.

80
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,518
When the Particle Accelerator
exploded,

81
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,221
the dark matter that collided
with Professor Stein

82
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,490
fused with the Firestorm matrix
and altered

83
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,660
the normal molecular processes
that occurs within his body.

84
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:50,529
Those highly reactive
molecules needed

85
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,698
something to bond with
in order to stabilize.

86
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,999
And that's where Ronnie came in.

87
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,635
Yes, and now that
Ronnie is no longer

88
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,270
a part of Professor Stein...

89
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,905
Those molecules don't have
anything to bond to.

90
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,473
And the longer he goes
without merging,

91
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:04,009
the more unstable he becomes.

92
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:08,914
All right, so, what do we do?

93
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,817
We find another...
participant.

94
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,919
Okay, cool, so,
how do we do that?

95
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,120
Are we just gonna make
a Tinder app

96
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,655
for potential meta-humans?

97
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:17,656
'Cause I'm pretty sure
merging with Stein

98
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,124
and randomly bursting
into flames

99
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,659
sounds like the biggest
"swipe left" of all time.

100
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:24,296
I mean, even if we could
find someone willing,

101
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:26,098
Stein can't just merge
with whoever he wants.

102
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,767
No he can't,
but I have done some research,

103
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,769
and found two potential
candidates

104
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,471
that might be compatible
with him.

105
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,573
They both were affected
by the dark matter,

106
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,008
and they were both admitted
to the hospital

107
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,911
showing symptoms
of gene rearrangement mutation.

108
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:40,779
And they both share
the same blood type

109
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,114
as Professor Stein and Ronnie.

110
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,349
All right.

111
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,452
I mean, this is more
than organ donation.

112
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:47,786
We'll need more
than tissue typing

113
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,722
to see if their bodies
are compatible.

114
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,891
If I can isolate
the genetic locus

115
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,293
of the two candidates
and cross-reference it

116
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,328
with the mutations
in Professor Stein,

117
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,766
I might be able to find a match
and save his life.

118
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,170
What do you need to do that?

119
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:27,660
All right, blood samples
from both potential candidates.

120
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,528
Damn, that was fast
even for you.

121
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,299
I may have skipped
the asking for permission part.

122
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:35,200
Let's see if we can't
find a match.

123
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,775
You were two in that picture.

124
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:46,478
You'd just got some shots.
You were so mad at the nurse.

125
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,113
You kept saying,
"She pinched me."

126
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,850
So we took you to the park
afterwards to cheer you up,

127
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,852
gave you your first
ice cream cone,

128
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,689
which was a mistake, because
all we heard the next month was,

129
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,824
"Mint-choplat chip,
mint-choplat chip."

130
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:03,529
That's where the obsession started.

131
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,099
Babe, you don't have to do this.

132
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:11,637
If you don't want to meet
your mother tomorrow, I get it.

133
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,873
No, it's okay.
I want to meet her.

134
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,544
I need to meet her.

135
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:21,347
It's gonna be fine.

136
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,383
My brave baby girl.

137
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:27,019
Take after you.

138
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,623
Love you.

139
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,759
Love you more.

140
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,264
Barry?

141
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,233
Hey, I was just looking for you.

142
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,968
I would've called, but I don't
have your number yet, so.

143
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,403
Oh, yeah...

144
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,271
No, no, no, I just wanted
to show you this.

145
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,539
These were just found

146
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,807
in an alley
off of Eastwood Avenue.

147
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,109
What are these, teeth?

148
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,510
Shark teeth.

149
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,245
And I have an eyewitness
that says

150
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:57,916
he saw a shark walking
on land... a man-shark.

151
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,418
- Man-shark?
- Yeah.

152
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,020
Sounds like
a bad sci-fi movie.

153
00:07:01,022 --> 00:07:02,688
Or awesome sci-fi movie.

154
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,590
Totally.

155
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:07,826
Are you for real?
You think there's actually,

156
00:07:07,828 --> 00:07:09,261
like, a shark...

157
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,231
Yeah, I mean, I know
it sounds really wacko...

158
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,399
- Mm-hmm.
- But, I mean,

159
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,400
nothing seems impossible
now that

160
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:15,901
we have meta-humans,
right?

161
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,269
And I thought it would be fun,
you know,

162
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,405
for us to work together again
on a case.

163
00:07:19,407 --> 00:07:20,839
Yeah, I mean, I really...

164
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,541
I'd love to work on anything
with you.

165
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,676
It's just, you know,

166
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:28,013
meta-humans aren't
really my thing.

167
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,783
Oh, okay, yeah, that's fine.
I can handle it.

168
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,318
No, you... look,
how about I just...

169
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,822
I'll run a test,
see where the teeth came from.

170
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:37,890
That would be amazing.

171
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:38,957
- All right, cool.
- Thanks.

172
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,958
Yeah, sure.

173
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,527
Detective Spivot.

174
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,828
Detective.

175
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,997
How's your man-shark case
coming?

176
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,432
It's good.
I was just gonna go

177
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:48,100
and canvas the area,
see what else I can dig up,

178
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:50,569
and Barry here agreed
to run some tests for me.

179
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,703
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,106
So, progress.
Thanks again.

181
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:57,676
If I didn't know any better,

182
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,845
I'd say you were flirting
with my partner.

183
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:01,480
What, Patty?
No, I'm...

184
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:02,915
What are you talking about?

185
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,283
I'm not...

186
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:08,387
What is it with you and Iris
and my partners?

187
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:10,289
Hey, how is Iris, by the way?

188
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,824
Eh, she's pretty nervous

189
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:12,891
about seeing her mother

190
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,059
after all these years.

191
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,494
Yeah.

192
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,162
Hey, you know what, I gotta go.

193
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,164
It's Cisco.
It's about Professor Stein.

194
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,599
Okay, go.
I'll cover you with Singh.

195
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,768
All right, thanks.

196
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,839
Well, I must admit,
I never imagined

197
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,042
the Sphinx's riddle about a man
requiring three legs

198
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,310
would ever apply to me,

199
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,879
but if this device
keeps me mobile,

200
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,447
then I will gratefully oblige.

201
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:38,350
Hopefully, you won't need it
for much longer.

202
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,452
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

203
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,321
and cross-matching
was negative for both,

204
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:43,822
and it appears that
the dark matter

205
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,424
from the Particle Accelerator
explosion

206
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:47,259
mutated their genes
in a very similar way

207
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,727
it did to yours.

208
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,762
I think they're both
potential matches.

209
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,997
So who do we go with?

210
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,199
Well, my first choice
is Henry Hewitt.

211
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,436
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson University

212
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,071
with a double major
in Applied Physics

213
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:00,305
and Bioengineering.

214
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,974
A Hudson boy,
I like him already.

215
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,710
Now, what about this other guy
Jefferson Jackson?

216
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,146
High school quarterback,
4.0 student.

217
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,815
He's got the physical
attributes.

218
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,885
And it looks like more of his
alleles match than Hewitt's.

219
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,254
Doesn't that mean
that he's more compatible?

220
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:18,590
On paper, perhaps,
but Hewitt is a scientist.

221
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,160
Clearly, he's trying to make
something of his life.

222
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,629
I think he'd be open
to something like this.

223
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,796
I think we should meet
with both of them

224
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,898
before we make a decision.

225
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,232
That's an excellent idea.

226
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,800
I'll see if I can
get Hewitt here.

227
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,235
All right, in the meantime,

228
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,436
we'll go meet with
Jefferson Jackson.

229
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,071
And I will try to find
something else

230
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,741
to help keep you stable.

231
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:00,780
Are you sure this is
the right place?

232
00:10:00,782 --> 00:10:03,482
Yeah.
Jefferson's a mechanic.

233
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,019
Could indicate
a strong technical aptitude.

234
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,321
That's a positive.

235
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:10,523
Oh, prone to allergies.

236
00:10:10,525 --> 00:10:12,758
That's definitely a negative,

237
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,127
not to mention
his taste in music.

238
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:16,662
Would you prefer Celine Dion

239
00:10:16,664 --> 00:10:18,164
instead?

240
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,999
I got the "Titanic" soundtrack
in the back there.

241
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:20,967
No, thank you.

242
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,468
Jefferson Jackson, right?

243
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,736
People call me Jax.

244
00:10:23,738 --> 00:10:25,571
Ooh, catchy.

245
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:28,741
My name's Barry Allen,
and this is Martin Stein.

246
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,443
We're with
the Department of Safety.

247
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,979
It's a small,
newly formed agency.

248
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:36,182
Very new, we probably don't
even have a website yet, do we?

249
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:37,617
You need to see our licenses?

250
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:38,985
I mean, we're all
up to code here.

251
00:10:38,987 --> 00:10:41,053
No, no, nothing like that.

252
00:10:41,055 --> 00:10:44,423
We are compiling data
on people who were affected

253
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,325
by the Particle Accelerator
explosion two years ago.

254
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:48,327
Look, man, I lost
enough time in my life

255
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,162
'cause of that stupid thing
going wrong.

256
00:10:50,164 --> 00:10:52,298
Now, you don't got a car
I can fix, I can't help you.

257
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,167
If you would consider coming
back to S.T.A.R. Labs with us,

258
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,802
I believe we can help you.

259
00:10:56,804 --> 00:10:58,270
Help me how?

260
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:01,407
Well, we know what
the Particle Accelerator did...

261
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,709
Look, I already told you,
I don't talk about that night.

262
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,144
Why is that?

263
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:06,579
Because that's when
everything changed.

264
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:07,847
I got hit hard.

265
00:11:07,849 --> 00:11:09,382
When I woke up,
I was in the hospital.

266
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:11,350
Busted up leg, torn ACL.

267
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:13,719
The look on my mom's face,
I knew any dreams I had

268
00:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,688
of playing pro ball were over.

269
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,889
I'm sorry to hear that.

270
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:18,691
Yeah, well...

271
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,359
look, I gotta get back to work.

272
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,695
Yeah...

273
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:25,231
Here, it's just...

274
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:27,967
it's our number.

275
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,835
Just think about it, okay?

276
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,719
Thank you for putting this
together, Joseph.

277
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:49,088
Iris's idea, not mine.

278
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,191
Hey, baby.

279
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:54,060
Hi, Dad.

280
00:11:57,331 --> 00:12:02,068
Iris...
this is Francine.

281
00:12:02,937 --> 00:12:04,070
Hello.

282
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:08,074
Hi.
Hello, Iris.

283
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:11,711
Can I get you a coffee
or something?

284
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:15,381
No, thanks.

285
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:18,818
Let's just sit.

286
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,187
I can't get over
what a beautiful young woman

287
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:22,621
you've become.

288
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:26,892
And a journalist?
I'm so proud of you.

289
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:29,328
Why are you here?

290
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,232
Why now, after two decades?

291
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:35,201
I want to make this
right with you.

292
00:12:35,203 --> 00:12:37,136
How about you start
by apologizing

293
00:12:37,138 --> 00:12:38,704
for walking out on us?

294
00:12:38,706 --> 00:12:43,409
I am sorry, so very, very sorry.

295
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:47,246
There's so much you don't know.

296
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:51,417
I'm sure that you've
been through a great deal,

297
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,719
and I can appreciate
you feeling like this is

298
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:57,857
suddenly the right time
for you to want me in your life,

299
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,925
but that doesn't mean that it's
the right time for me.

300
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:00,926
Iris...

301
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:02,695
No, Dad, it's okay.

302
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:04,497
I've thought about this a lot,

303
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:07,933
and it wasn't fair for me
to make you the bad guy.

304
00:13:07,935 --> 00:13:11,036
So I want you to hear this
from me.

305
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:13,506
I don't hate you, Francine.

306
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,275
I do wish you well,

307
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:20,479
but we have lived separate lives
for over 20 years.

308
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:23,315
Let's keep it that way.

309
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:32,691
I've always thought

310
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:34,760
my destiny was
for greater things.

311
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:36,295
And people, of course.

312
00:13:36,297 --> 00:13:37,563
Well, when it's all
said and done,

313
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:39,265
flying will be
the least impressive

314
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,167
of your new abilities.

315
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:45,538
Man finally achieves
the promise of the Atomic Age.

316
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,807
Caitlin, what's going on?

317
00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:51,443
Hi, I'm glad you're back.
This is Dr. Henry Hewitt.

318
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:53,546
This is Barry Allen and
Professor Martin Stein.

319
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:54,613
How do you do?

320
00:13:54,615 --> 00:13:56,515
The illustrious Martin Stein.

321
00:13:56,517 --> 00:13:58,350
I've read all your papers
back at Hudson,

322
00:13:58,352 --> 00:14:02,154
especially on transmutation.
Fascinating.

323
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:04,023
- You're a legend.
- Oh, please.

324
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,125
I think you're overestimating
my contribution to the field.

325
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:07,693
- I... I appreciate your enthusiasm.
- Isn't he great?

326
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:09,295
He's got an ego
the size of Texas,

327
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,797
but, yeah, he's all right.

328
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,999
So, where's Jefferson Jackson?

329
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,734
We just need more time.

330
00:14:15,736 --> 00:14:17,002
We don't have more time.

331
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:18,504
I couldn't find
another power source

332
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:20,206
for the cane
and that thing's running out.

333
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,041
Okay, then let's do the merge.
Hewitt's in.

334
00:14:22,043 --> 00:14:23,075
What do you mean?
You told him the details

335
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:24,643
of the Firestorm Matrix?

336
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:26,912
Absolutely, becoming Firestorm
is a huge life change.

337
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:28,614
He needs to know what
he's getting himself into.

338
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:31,851
If I remember correctly,
vector, variance, hypotenuse...

339
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:34,353
Proton, neutron, go H.U.!

340
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:36,222
Aw, look at that,
that's so cute.

341
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:38,390
We'll have two Professor Steins
if this works.

342
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:39,358
It's gonna work.

343
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,193
Yeah.

344
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:42,828
Okay.

345
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,964
When I put this splicer
on your chest

346
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,732
you're gonna feel a rush.

347
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:48,534
That's a molecular primer
being released into your body.

348
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:50,236
Then you can make
physical contact

349
00:14:50,238 --> 00:14:52,204
with Professor Stein, and...

350
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,707
Firestorm Matrix will take over.

351
00:14:54,709 --> 00:14:55,708
Easy enough.

352
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,176
Ready?

353
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,545
No time like the present.
Thank you, my dear.

354
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:01,113
Okay.

355
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:19,899
Try again.

356
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:36,582
This is unexpected.

357
00:15:36,584 --> 00:15:40,486
Something's supposed to be
happening, right?

358
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:41,553
Why isn't it working?

359
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:42,755
I don't know.

360
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:44,790
Well,

361
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:48,160
looks like you two aren't
compatible after all.

362
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:50,529
I'm just gonna...

363
00:15:50,531 --> 00:15:52,965
So all this was for nothing?

364
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:56,669
Believe me, no one is
more disappointed than I am.

365
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,038
Yeah, don't be so sure
about that.

366
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,774
Next time, try to get
your act together

367
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:05,010
before you get
someone's hopes up.

368
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:29,702
Move the show-and-tell
to next Tuesday,

369
00:16:29,704 --> 00:16:31,136
remind me to call Richard
tomorrow

370
00:16:31,138 --> 00:16:32,771
about the shareholders meeting,
and where are we

371
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:34,473
with the replacement
for Doctor Snow?

372
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:40,212
Applied sciences.

373
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:51,323
Stop!

374
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,591
Don't move!

375
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:56,855
Harrison?

376
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:04,273
Detective West, thank you for coming.

377
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:05,592
Doctor McGee,
this is my new partner,

378
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:06,693
Detective Spivot.

379
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,404
It's nice to meet you.

380
00:17:08,524 --> 00:17:10,624
I was saddened
by Detective Thawne's passing.

381
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:12,827
Please extend my condolences
to your daughter.

382
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,495
Thank you.
On the phone

383
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:17,131
you mentioned this was
a sensitive matter.

384
00:17:17,133 --> 00:17:18,999
It is, and I called you directly

385
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:22,236
because I've always appreciated
your discretion in the past.

386
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:24,371
Of course, can you tell me
what was stolen?

387
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:27,174
It's not so much what was
stolen, but who stole it.

388
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:30,144
The person who broke into
my facility last night

389
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:31,879
was Harrison Wells.

390
00:17:33,482 --> 00:17:35,282
Harrison Wells is dead.

391
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:37,251
I seem to recall
the circumstances

392
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,486
around his passing were
a bit inconclusive.

393
00:17:39,488 --> 00:17:41,822
Is there any possibility
he could be alive?

394
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,224
Zero possibility.

395
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:44,992
I knew the man
for over 20 years.

396
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:47,094
I know who I saw.

397
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:50,197
The only thing distinctively
different was...

398
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:53,334
he's walking again.

399
00:17:53,336 --> 00:17:56,537
Like I said,
I trust your discretion.

400
00:17:56,539 --> 00:17:58,472
You have full access
to the facility.

401
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:01,675
Thank you again, Detective.

402
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:08,249
First a shark-man,
now a dead man walking.

403
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,417
We need to call Barry,
get him in here first.

404
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,721
Barry can't hear
about any of this.

405
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:15,356
What... why?

406
00:18:15,358 --> 00:18:17,057
Because he's got
a lot on his plate.

407
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:18,492
He's got a friend who's sick
who he needs his help,

408
00:18:18,494 --> 00:18:21,428
and Harrison Wells is the man
who murdered his mother.

409
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,397
Once he hears that...

410
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:24,465
Is he okay?

411
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,133
He's fine, but...

412
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:28,702
not a word to him or anyone,
okay?

413
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:30,437
Okay.

414
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:33,807
Yeah, it's just,
I'm not really good at lying.

415
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:36,844
Well, you better learn, quick.

416
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:40,014
Yeah, definitely.

417
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,890
Spivot, go on ahead.

418
00:18:49,892 --> 00:18:51,825
Sure.

419
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:54,228
This is the last time
you ever show up here.

420
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,362
Do you understand?

421
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:56,597
I needed to talk to you again.

422
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:59,266
How much clearer
do we need to be?

423
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:01,268
Iris and I do not want you
in our lives.

424
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,270
Leave, please.

425
00:19:03,272 --> 00:19:06,040
Go home, live your life.

426
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,309
Joe, there's something else.

427
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,377
I wanted to tell you
when I first saw you, but...

428
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:13,514
What is it?

429
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:19,486
A few months ago, I started getting weak.

430
00:19:19,488 --> 00:19:20,754
The doctors ran
a bunch of tests,

431
00:19:20,756 --> 00:19:23,190
they couldn't figure it out.

432
00:19:23,192 --> 00:19:26,026
But finally, they did.

433
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:29,430
Said I have something
called MacGregor's.

434
00:19:29,432 --> 00:19:34,935
Supposedly it's pretty common
among ex-addicts.

435
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:39,974
Told me I had till the end
of the year if I'm lucky.

436
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:42,676
Is... is that why
you came back?

437
00:19:42,678 --> 00:19:46,113
I just want my daughter
to know me...

438
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,082
this me.

439
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:58,959
I'm really glad
you decided to come.

440
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:01,628
I thought S.T.A.R. Labs
had to shut down.

441
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,997
It's under new management.

442
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,667
Whoa, what kind of treadmill
is that?

443
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:07,901
Cosmic.

444
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:11,005
Cool.

445
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:12,873
So, let's get started.

446
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,975
You got some kind of
"Billion Dollar Man" technology

447
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:16,577
that gonna fix my knee?

448
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:19,446
Actually, Jax, this isn't
about fixing your knee.

449
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,382
What are you talking about?

450
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,283
When the Particle Accelerator
exploded,

451
00:20:23,285 --> 00:20:25,819
the energy wave
that collided with you

452
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:27,621
is known as "dark matter."

453
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,957
And it didn't just hurt
your knee.

454
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:33,761
It... it changed the molecular
structure of your body.

455
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:35,496
Whoa, hold on, Grey.

456
00:20:35,498 --> 00:20:37,231
So you're saying I'm like
one of those meta-humans

457
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,799
I keep hearing about
on the news?

458
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:42,102
Yes, I am.
Please, call me Professor.

459
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:44,772
We think you have
potential capabilities.

460
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:46,073
What kind of capabilities?

461
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:48,709
The same as Professor Stein:

462
00:20:48,711 --> 00:20:52,446
the ability for your body
to process fission and fusion.

463
00:20:52,448 --> 00:20:54,481
And you can harness
excess energy

464
00:20:54,483 --> 00:20:57,885
and turn it into these massive
nuclear blasts.

465
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:01,155
And you can fly.
There's also that.

466
00:21:01,157 --> 00:21:02,923
So you're saying
you can do all this?

467
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,925
Only during times of convergence

468
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:07,094
with a willing partner.

469
00:21:07,096 --> 00:21:09,963
Convergence?
You and me?

470
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:11,065
Yes.

471
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:16,070
No, this is crazy.

472
00:21:16,072 --> 00:21:18,072
No, Jax, this is your chance

473
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:19,673
to right the wrong
that was done to you.

474
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,708
Yeah, sorry,
you got the wrong guy.

475
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,210
I don't want nothing
to do with this.

476
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:24,344
Wait a second, we are
giving you the chance

477
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,046
to be a superhero,

478
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,514
and you're gonna say no
that quickly?

479
00:21:27,516 --> 00:21:29,049
Yeah, not my kind of thing.

480
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,351
If the man isn't willing
to participate...

481
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:33,754
Look, I saw your
test scores, Jax.

482
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,422
Your grades were good enough
to get into college,

483
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:38,625
but you didn't go.
Why?

484
00:21:38,627 --> 00:21:40,027
Is this the type of guy you are?

485
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:41,562
One setback and you fold?
Well, then maybe

486
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:43,263
you're not the guy for us
anyway.

487
00:21:43,265 --> 00:21:44,231
Well, maybe I'm not.

488
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:46,333
Jack...

489
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:49,436
Maybe this just wasn't
meant to be.

490
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,809
Cait, come on, I mean,

491
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:57,578
Jax could be our last chance

492
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,179
at saving Professor Stein.

493
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:02,416
He said no to being a superhero.
Who does that?

494
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:04,284
I mean, you didn't say no
when you had the chance.

495
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:05,586
Cisco, would you?

496
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:08,155
Chance to have superpowers?
Sign me up.

497
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:11,091
Look, we're asking Jax
to change his entire life,

498
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:13,060
to sacrifice what he does have.

499
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:16,096
I mean, that's not a decision
that can be made lightly.

500
00:22:16,098 --> 00:22:18,031
It took me a long time

501
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:20,000
to figure out this whole
hero thing.

502
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:23,570
Exactly, which is why we need
someone who wants to do this.

503
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,340
Where are you going?

504
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:30,210
To get Hewitt back.
We have to try again.

505
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:37,951
Human DNA?

506
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:40,454
Yup, definitely not
a man-shark.

507
00:22:40,456 --> 00:22:41,922
Not even a land shark, Ma'am.

508
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:43,524
Well, thanks for testing it
for me.

509
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:45,959
Yeah.
What are you gonna do now?

510
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:48,095
I don't know, probably file it
under "never gonna happen."

511
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:49,229
I have another case anyway.

512
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:51,098
Oh, anything I can
help you with?

513
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,301
No, no, no, no,
Detective said definitely n-not.

514
00:22:54,303 --> 00:22:56,103
Is everything all good?

515
00:22:56,105 --> 00:22:57,204
Sure, why?

516
00:22:57,206 --> 00:22:58,605
I don't know,

517
00:22:58,607 --> 00:22:59,640
you're just acting
kind of different.

518
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:01,108
No!
No.

519
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,579
I'm the same old P. Spivot,
you know?

520
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:08,615
What... actually, I have to go,
but thank you so much

521
00:23:08,617 --> 00:23:11,084
for testing this,
and I'll see you.

522
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:13,353
Okay, I...

523
00:23:21,697 --> 00:23:24,498
Yo, Joe.

524
00:23:26,602 --> 00:23:29,503
You good?
Everything all right?

525
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:31,972
Yeah.
No, I'm...

526
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:33,207
just had hell of a day.

527
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:34,808
Yeah?

528
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:39,813
Iris's mother,

529
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:42,549
she told me she was dying.

530
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,152
Yeah, and I know Francine.

531
00:23:45,154 --> 00:23:47,721
She's telling the truth
about this.

532
00:23:47,723 --> 00:23:49,856
Okay.

533
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:51,625
Does Iris know?

534
00:23:51,627 --> 00:23:53,493
Not yet.

535
00:23:55,331 --> 00:23:57,631
Did...
did you need something?

536
00:23:57,633 --> 00:24:01,201
No, no.
I just...

537
00:24:01,203 --> 00:24:04,404
Patty said you that
you don't want me on some case

538
00:24:04,406 --> 00:24:05,672
that she's on with you.

539
00:24:05,674 --> 00:24:07,174
No.

540
00:24:07,176 --> 00:24:08,709
I was checking out a lead.

541
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:10,377
I'll let you know.

542
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,479
All right, cool.

543
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:15,015
What is up with you
and my partner, anyway?

544
00:24:15,017 --> 00:24:16,750
Come on, I...

545
00:24:16,752 --> 00:24:20,254
Bar, you can't
take your eyes off that girl.

546
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:21,922
I don't know what
you want me to tell you.

547
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:23,490
I mean, she's great, you know.

548
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:26,059
She's adorable and funny

549
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:28,195
and we have
a lot in common, but...

550
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:29,997
"But, um."

551
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,768
I don't know.
She's not Iris, I guess.

552
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,704
Right.

553
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:40,674
You've known Iris
since you were ten.

554
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:44,411
You've been in love with her
since forever.

555
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:50,183
I mean, you two are friends now,
but she was your first love.

556
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:55,222
You're never gonna feel
the same about anybody else,

557
00:24:55,224 --> 00:25:00,427
but you can't let that stop you
from exploring something new.

558
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,563
Yeah.

559
00:25:05,467 --> 00:25:07,601
<i>And in happier news,
remember Flash Day,</i>

560
00:25:07,603 --> 00:25:09,336
<i>the downtown celebration
to honor</i>

561
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:11,505
<i>Central City's
one and only superhero?</i>

562
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:13,040
<i>Well, just weeks...</i>

563
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:16,476
Hewitt, you have
those nucleosome results?

564
00:25:16,478 --> 00:25:17,611
Tomorrow.

565
00:25:17,613 --> 00:25:19,746
I told you
I needed them tonight.

566
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:22,582
And I'm telling you
you'll have them tomorrow.

567
00:25:22,584 --> 00:25:24,117
You know, I know you think

568
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,186
you're smarter than
everyone here, Hewitt,

569
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:28,088
but I'm sick of you not doing your job,

570
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,690
your not showing up.

571
00:25:29,692 --> 00:25:32,559
If I have any more trouble
from you, you're done here.

572
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:33,927
What, you're gonna
take the test away

573
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:35,595
and give it to another
lab rat of yours?

574
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:37,698
You're gonna report me
to the board?

575
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,366
Or maybe you're thinking
of firing me?

576
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:40,901
I'd like to see you try!

577
00:25:40,903 --> 00:25:43,437
Now get the hell out of my lab!

578
00:25:53,575 --> 00:25:54,840
<i>What's being described as</i>

579
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:56,375
<i>a "spontaneous
energy malfunction"</i>

580
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:59,006
<i>erupted last night
at Eikmeier Technologies.</i>

581
00:25:59,126 --> 00:26:02,361
<i>Wanted for questioning
is scientist Henry Hewitt.</i>

582
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:04,129
Hewitt's dormant abilities
must have been triggered

583
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,731
when we attempted the merger.

584
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,833
This could be catastrophic.

585
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,234
If his powers are
anything like mine,

586
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,737
he requires
a grounding mechanism

587
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:14,540
to stabilize his volatility.
Otherwise...

588
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,408
Yeah, he's gonna pop his top,

589
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,843
and he's got a long history
of violence,

590
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:19,077
according to his police record.

591
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,312
Police record?

592
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,480
I didn't find a police record.

593
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:22,681
Yeah, of course not,
it was sealed,

594
00:26:22,683 --> 00:26:25,350
but guess what,
ya boy hacked in and...

595
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:27,252
hold on, wait for it.

596
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:29,788
One count battery,
two counts aggravated assault,

597
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,557
court-ordered
anger management therapy.

598
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,858
He seemed like such a nice guy.

599
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
He even knew
your Hudson nerd song.

600
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,730
Whoa, you okay?

601
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,099
It appears Mr. Hewitt's
stability

602
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:43,702
isn't the only one in question.

603
00:26:43,704 --> 00:26:45,270
I think I need to lie down.

604
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,471
Yeah, I'll come with you.

605
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:48,340
Thank you.

606
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,077
Professor Stein is
getting worse.

607
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:54,646
And Hewitt's like this
because of me.

608
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:56,915
And now Jefferson Jackson
will never come back

609
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,785
because of what I said.

610
00:26:59,787 --> 00:27:04,323
I just didn't believe
that he has what it takes.

611
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:08,527
This isn't because
you didn't believe in him.

612
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:13,966
Sometimes, great possibilities
are right in front of us,

613
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:17,369
and we don't see them,
because we choose not to.

614
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:23,175
I think that we need to be open
to exploring something new.

615
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:34,920
She's dying?

616
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:37,155
A few months left.

617
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:39,458
I just don't think
I can see her, Dad.

618
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,126
And that's fine.

619
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:44,830
But you and me need to be
crystal clear about this, Iris.

620
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:47,232
If you want to have
a relationship with Francine,

621
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:49,601
it's okay with me.
You don't have to protect me.

622
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:51,403
I'm a grown man and
I've dealt with these feelings

623
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:54,573
a long time ago.

624
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:58,410
So you... you just
believe her?

625
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:00,178
She's done some bad things
in her life,

626
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:03,282
but she wouldn't lie about this.

627
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:05,183
Dad, she shows up
out of nowhere,

628
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:08,954
and only says that she's dying
after I told her to stay away.

629
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:12,491
Look, she didn't come
to Central City to see me.

630
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:14,259
She came because of you.

631
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:15,861
I just wanted you
to know everything

632
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:17,596
so you can make
the best decision for yourself.

633
00:28:17,598 --> 00:28:21,033
I mean, she is still
your mother.

634
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:25,304
Either way, whatever you decide,
just know, I got your back.

635
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:30,275
I know.

636
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:39,184
Let me guess,

637
00:28:39,186 --> 00:28:40,819
you don't got car troubles.

638
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:44,856
I came to apologize.
I'm sorry for what I said.

639
00:28:44,858 --> 00:28:47,092
It's fine.
Apology accepted.

640
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:48,727
Look, we could really
use your help

641
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,162
to save Professor Stein.

642
00:28:50,164 --> 00:28:51,697
That desperate, huh?

643
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:53,398
Yes.

644
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,669
My husband, Ronnie,

645
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:00,305
he used to be
Professor Stein's other half.

646
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,841
He actually helped
build the Particle Accelerator,

647
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:08,980
and when it exploded,
he was affected by it too.

648
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:11,717
Ironically, that's how
he got the chance

649
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:17,489
to show the world
what he was truly capable of.

650
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:19,624
And he died saving this city.

651
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:23,061
Wait, he was the guy that flew
into the black hole?

652
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,696
That was him?

653
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:26,064
He was a hero.

654
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:28,133
You can be one too.

655
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,901
I never wanted to be a hero.

656
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,536
What I wanted was
to go to college,

657
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:33,238
but we couldn't afford it.

658
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,174
Football was my way in,
until that got taken from me.

659
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:38,710
I know.
Look, I know

660
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:40,812
the Particle Accelerator
took something from you.

661
00:29:40,814 --> 00:29:43,915
But it also gave you
something in return,

662
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:47,085
something even more spectacular,

663
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:50,655
the opportunity to be
part of something bigger,

664
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:53,592
to be part of a team
that's working to protect people

665
00:29:53,594 --> 00:29:55,527
from losing what you lost.

666
00:29:57,364 --> 00:30:00,098
I believe you were meant
to be a hero.

667
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:08,006
Whoa, hold on.

668
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,908
I've been looking for you,
Dr. Snow.

669
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,544
Hey, look, man, we're...
ugh!

670
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,786
You did this to me!

671
00:30:20,788 --> 00:30:23,889
But it's not
what you promised, is it?

672
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,958
Is it?

673
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:32,297
Come on!

674
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:38,503
Where to?

675
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,405
S.T.A.R. Labs.

676
00:30:54,744 --> 00:30:55,604
Caitlin.

677
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,062
- What's wrong?
- Come here.

678
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,630
Oh, good, you're here.

679
00:30:59,632 --> 00:31:01,566
This thing, it ran out,
like, 30 minutes ago.

680
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,335
His temperature is 142 degrees
and rising fast.

681
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:05,536
He's going into rapid oxidation.

682
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:06,938
We need to find a coolant.

683
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,807
I think it's too late for that.

684
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,642
I'll do it.

685
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:13,444
I'll merge with him.

686
00:31:13,446 --> 00:31:14,645
You said this is a chance
for me to be

687
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:16,848
a part of something bigger
than myself,

688
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,617
to help people.
That's what I want.

689
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:21,152
You're sure?

690
00:31:21,154 --> 00:31:23,888
Once you merge, there's no
going back on this.

691
00:31:24,858 --> 00:31:26,257
And you said I could fly, right?

692
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,159
- Damn right.
- Okay.

693
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:29,694
So what do I do?

694
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:31,562
Okay, well,
here's the abridged version.

695
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:33,397
Professor Stein?

696
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,967
- Professor Stein?
- Clarissa, five more minutes.

697
00:31:35,969 --> 00:31:37,835
No, Professor,
you have to get up.

698
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:38,870
Jax is here.

699
00:31:38,872 --> 00:31:39,837
- Yeah.
- What?

700
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,139
- Jax is here.
- What?

701
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:42,340
- Here, grab onto me.
- Jax?

702
00:31:42,342 --> 00:31:43,342
Yeah.

703
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,278
This is it.

704
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:59,991
You came back, Jefferson,
thank you.

705
00:31:59,993 --> 00:32:01,659
Well, like my coach always said,

706
00:32:01,661 --> 00:32:04,629
"Out of yourself
and into the team."

707
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,997
So, how's this work?

708
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:07,932
Okay, all you're gonna do
is touch him.

709
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:08,933
And then what happens?

710
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:10,234
You become Firestorm.

711
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:11,869
Okay.

712
00:32:28,054 --> 00:32:30,254
Jax?

713
00:32:32,392 --> 00:32:34,725
Is Professor Stein...

714
00:32:34,727 --> 00:32:36,093
How will I know?

715
00:32:36,095 --> 00:32:37,295
<i>Hello, Jefferson.</i>

716
00:32:37,297 --> 00:32:38,529
<i>Now you know.</i>

717
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,832
Oh, so I get Grey as my copilot.

718
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:44,001
<i>Did no one ever inform you
of that fringe benefit?</i>

719
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,637
So when do we get to take this
for a test spin?

720
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:50,842
How about now?

721
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:52,476
It looks like
Hewitt's re-charging

722
00:32:52,478 --> 00:32:54,318
at Central City High School's
football stadium.

723
00:32:55,481 --> 00:32:57,748
Wait, that was where I got hurt.

724
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,401
Cisco, cut the power
to the field

725
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:18,769
so he can't draw anymore energy.

726
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,338
I'm on it.
Stand by.

727
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,476
Boo-ya ka!

728
00:33:32,185 --> 00:33:35,319
Hewitt!
You need to stop!

729
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:37,154
This is not who you are!

730
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,928
Stein?
You chose him over me?

731
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,998
That's who I'm supposed to be!

732
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,734
I deserve the Firestorm Matrix!

733
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,569
<i>Move, now!</i>

734
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,172
<i>Calm down, Jefferson, focus.</i>

735
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:58,843
<i>Use your natural athleticism
to gain control.</i>

736
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:03,848
Hey, you okay?

737
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,684
I was a quarterback.
I know how to take a hit.

738
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,719
Hey, guys,
cutting the power didn't work.

739
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:11,222
It's like the more we anger him,
the stronger he gets.

740
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:12,924
That's it, it's like
one of those,

741
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,992
controlled fusion devices.

742
00:34:14,994 --> 00:34:16,027
Tokamak?

743
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:17,295
Yes, exactly,

744
00:34:17,297 --> 00:34:18,496
and the more powerful
they become,

745
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:20,064
the more unstable they become.

746
00:34:20,066 --> 00:34:22,967
Barry, make him angry,
and he'll blow his fuse.

747
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:26,237
You up for a little game
of "catch me if you can?"

748
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,506
Let's go for it.

749
00:34:28,508 --> 00:34:30,141
Okay.

750
00:34:37,317 --> 00:34:39,817
Hey, Hewitt, over here!

751
00:34:41,387 --> 00:34:43,688
Paging Dr. Hewitt.

752
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,122
Boo!

753
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,691
Aah!

754
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,360
Man, you are not good at this.

755
00:34:49,362 --> 00:34:50,528
Aah!

756
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,063
Do you need a hug, Doctor?

757
00:34:52,065 --> 00:34:54,265
Aah!

758
00:34:56,402 --> 00:34:59,070
Come on, Hewitt,
give me your best shot!

759
00:34:59,072 --> 00:35:00,171
<i>Now.</i>

760
00:35:05,545 --> 00:35:06,978
Is that all you got, Hewitt?

761
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,479
Man, no wonder you didn't
make the cut

762
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,513
if that's how you fight.

763
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:16,287
Aah!

764
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:28,032
Not bad for your first go
at this.

765
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:30,401
Well, I had a great coach
to help me through it.

766
00:35:30,403 --> 00:35:31,635
Isn't that right, Grey?

767
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:33,371
<i>Despite my initial</i>

768
00:35:33,373 --> 00:35:35,606
<i>reservations, we make
a pretty fantastic team.</i>

769
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:39,744
Welcome aboard, Firestorm.

770
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,689
Hi.

771
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,353
Thank you for coming.

772
00:36:01,854 --> 00:36:04,538
You have no idea
what this means to me.

773
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:07,056
My dad told me you were sick.

774
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:11,103
You know, I wasn't sure
that I could believe you,

775
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,856
so I did some checking.

776
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,100
Turns out you're
telling the truth.

777
00:36:17,102 --> 00:36:21,037
I would never lie to you
about something so big.

778
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:22,465
Really?

779
00:36:23,575 --> 00:36:25,242
'Cause I was actually thinking
that I could give you

780
00:36:25,244 --> 00:36:30,180
another chance
after hearing that news.

781
00:36:30,182 --> 00:36:34,918
But you're still lying,
still keeping secrets.

782
00:36:36,788 --> 00:36:39,256
I'm an investigative reporter,
Francine.

783
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:43,460
I uncover things that people
want to keep hidden,

784
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:45,362
like having a son.

785
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:46,863
Iris...

786
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:49,199
He was born eight months
after you left Central City.

787
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:50,367
Let me explain.

788
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:52,869
Who's the father, Francine?

789
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:56,373
Is it my dad?

790
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:59,676
Do I have a brother?

791
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:03,580
Wait, you know, I don't even
want... I don't want to know.

792
00:37:03,582 --> 00:37:04,814
I mean, I wouldn't
be able to tell

793
00:37:04,816 --> 00:37:06,149
if you were telling the truth
or if it was

794
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:07,984
another one of your lies,
anyway.

795
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:12,856
I want you to leave.

796
00:37:12,858 --> 00:37:16,393
You stay away from me, and
you stay away from my father.

797
00:37:16,395 --> 00:37:19,029
If he finds out that he might
have a son that grew up

798
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:22,432
without even knowing him,
it would crush him.

799
00:37:22,434 --> 00:37:24,134
Just...

800
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:27,470
Leave us alone.

801
00:37:27,472 --> 00:37:30,173
Iris, I was...

802
00:37:35,247 --> 00:37:36,913
And how is Mr. Hewitt?

803
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:39,316
Seems like that last burst
of energy has burnt him out.

804
00:37:39,318 --> 00:37:41,084
Our Tokamak's gone dark.

805
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:42,385
Yeah, we're just gonna keep him

806
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:43,920
safe and sound in the pipeline

807
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:46,022
till he decides to keep
quiet about all this.

808
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:47,791
So you're gonna
meet up with Clarissa?

809
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:49,359
We're meeting in Pittsburgh
in three days.

810
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:50,694
Why Pittsburgh?

811
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:52,529
A colleague of mine
was monumental

812
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:54,597
in helping train Ronald and me.

813
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:56,866
She's graciously offered
to help the two of us as well.

814
00:37:56,868 --> 00:37:58,234
How's she gonna help us?

815
00:37:58,236 --> 00:38:00,203
Well, there were many aspects
of our abilities

816
00:38:00,205 --> 00:38:02,272
that we never quite achieved.

817
00:38:02,274 --> 00:38:06,509
Hopefully now, we can
fully realize that potential.

818
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,914
Oh, my dearest
Dr. Snow.

819
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:19,923
Ronald may be lost to us,
but he will never be forgotten.

820
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:24,794
Speaking of...

821
00:38:24,796 --> 00:38:27,464
this was Ronnie's.

822
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:30,333
He always used it to
find his way back home.

823
00:38:30,335 --> 00:38:31,935
I want you to have it.

824
00:38:35,407 --> 00:38:38,108
Thank you.

825
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,943
You know,
this whole thing is strange,

826
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,678
being 50% of someone.

827
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,314
Yeah, but you're 100% a hero.

828
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:48,718
I went ahead and recalibrated
the splicer

829
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,620
so the merging should be
even smoother now.

830
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:51,921
Thank you.

831
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:55,725
If I may offer
a bit of parting advice.

832
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:58,995
Cisco, I know you're scared,

833
00:38:58,997 --> 00:39:03,600
but this ability you have
is a gift, not a curse.

834
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:05,969
It's natural to be apprehensive
about the unknown,

835
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:07,570
but look at Jefferson.

836
00:39:07,572 --> 00:39:11,647
He took a leap, and it changed
his life for the better.

837
00:39:13,545 --> 00:39:16,513
The very thing that makes
you different

838
00:39:16,515 --> 00:39:18,415
is what makes you special.

839
00:39:20,185 --> 00:39:22,318
Tell your friends.

840
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:31,027
And now I believe it's time
to take this show on the road...

841
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:33,329
or to the sky,
if I am to be literal.

842
00:39:41,139 --> 00:39:43,273
Are you ready, Jefferson?

843
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:01,724
All right.

844
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:04,494
- See you later.
- Yeah.

845
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:06,529
That was one hell
of a leap of faith

846
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:08,731
that kid took,
merging with Professor Stein.

847
00:40:08,733 --> 00:40:10,300
Yeah, it was.

848
00:40:10,302 --> 00:40:12,372
There's a lesson in there
somewhere for you.

849
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:17,240
<i>Things aren't always
what they seem.</i>

850
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:19,242
<i>Our fears can play tricks on us,</i>

851
00:40:19,244 --> 00:40:21,544
<i>making us afraid
to change course,</i>

852
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:23,480
<i>afraid to move on,</i>

853
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:25,482
<i>but usually,
hidden behind our fears</i>

854
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:28,384
<i>are second chances
waiting to be seized...</i>

855
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,891
<i>Second chances at life...</i>

856
00:40:40,499 --> 00:40:43,266
- Whoo!
<i>- At glory...</i>

857
00:40:43,268 --> 00:40:44,767
Whoo!

858
00:40:47,272 --> 00:40:50,006
<i>At family...</i>

859
00:40:55,013 --> 00:40:57,313
<i>At love.</i>

860
00:40:57,315 --> 00:40:59,949
<i>And these opportunities
don't come around every day,</i>

861
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:02,418
<i>so when they do,
we have to be brave,</i>

862
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,889
<i>take a chance,
and grab them while we can.</i>

863
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,494
Zoom wants you dead.

864
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:21,070
Oh, my God, it's real.

865
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:22,906
Hey!
Put him down!

866
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:25,408
Put your hands...
your fins in the air!

867
00:41:45,163 --> 00:41:47,297
Who the hell are you?

868
