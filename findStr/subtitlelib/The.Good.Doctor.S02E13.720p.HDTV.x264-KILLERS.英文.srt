20
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,670
Good morning.

21
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,850
Morning.

22
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,230
I'm Jake, we met last week.

23
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,810
Yes, we did.

24
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,220
I was just gonna get some juice.

25
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,100
- Hope you don't mind. - Are you a drummer?

26
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,060
Am I a drummer? No. No, I'm a chef.

27
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,480
Well, actually, just a cook, but --

28
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,030
Lea dates drummers.

29
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,580
I played clarinet in junior high.

30
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,460
What are you doing out here?

31
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,440
I told you to stay in my room.

32
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,020
I just snuck out to grab some O.J.

33
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,740
I was really thirsty.

34
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,930
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,290
I should've told you he was spending the night.

36
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,790
I like Jake.

37
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,140
That's nice of you to say.

38
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,060
I know it's difficult to have a stranger in your home.

39
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,520
I have to drive Dr. Glassman to his chemo appointment.

40
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,510
He's five days in and doing very well.

41
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,910
I'm helping him.

42
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,470
Jake is very sweet.

43
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,730
You know, when you get to know him, i'm sure you really will like him.

44
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,290
I said I like him.

45
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,020
Will he be spending the night here a lot now?

46
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,330
No, not a lot.

47
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,120
But...

48
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,080
would that be a problem?

49
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,150
- No. - So is it cool

50
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,350
if I have him over tonight to watch a movie?

51
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,580
It's cool.

52
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,220
I have to go.

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,150
Good morning, Dr. Glassman.

54
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,670
I let myself in. I'm downstairs.

55
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,150
How are you feeling today?

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,250
Good, actually. Better than yesterday.

57
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,530
Yes, your skin was a bit pale yesterday.

58
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,600
Today your color looks much better.

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,950
I brought you your electrolytes.

60
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,420
Thank you.

61
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,260
Cheers.

62
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,310
Why did you do that?

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,200
I don't like the flavor, the grape.

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,040
Are you experiencing nausea?

65
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,520
No, I didn't like the flavor, I told you.

66
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,270
I'm fine.

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,070
I'm glad you're feeling well.

68
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,950
Let's go, or we're going to be late.

69
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,900
Yep. Cancer's not gonna kill itself.

70
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,640
I was just thinking about you, too.

71
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,720
Actually, can I call you at lunch?

72
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,370
I'm with some people right now, and --

73
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,370
Yes, exactly.

74
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,150
We'll talk later.

75
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,530
Love you.

76
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,610
New girlfriend?

77
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,690
Still in the call-each-other-the-next-morning phase?

78
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,490
Yeah, you got me.

79
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,230
Actually, no. It was Mia.

80
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,200
We're giving our relationship another shot.

81
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,070
Park, that's great.

82
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,450
Yeah, I told you because part of the thing with Mia is...

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,460
I'm trying to be more open.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,880
Thanks. You didn't need to explain,

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,390
but sounds good.

86
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,430
She sounds like she's good for you.

87
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,440
Yeah.

88
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,760
Of course, if it doesn't work out,

89
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,300
I'll have to talk to you about that, too,

90
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,410
admit I failed.

91
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,670
Or I can be a supportive colleague

92
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,280
regardless of what happens.

93
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,740
70-year-old female. Neighbor saw her collapse in her yard.

94
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,800
Unresponsive. No heartbeat. EKG is flatlined.

95
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,270
Then she'd be cyanotic.

96
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,110
Good capillary refill -- she's perfusing?

97
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,280
Stop CPR.

98
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,040
And she's breathing. Your EKG must be broken.

99
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,860
Worked fine on our call right before her.

100
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,620
Everything works fine up until it doesn't.

101
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,600
- Nothing. - Told you.

102
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,630
Hook her up, let's check her vitals.

103
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,630
Blood is definitely flowing to her extremities.

104
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,160
Should we push epi, get the crash --

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,190
Wait. Everyone quiet.

106
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,610
Listen.

107
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,850
Is that...?

108
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,460
She doesn't have a rhythm

109
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,150
because she has a mechanical heart.

110
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,190
Lana Moore. 34-year-old female,

111
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,300
was slurring her words, symptom passed,

112
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,160
but we found a grade two arteriovenous malformation in her brain.

113
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,120
Are we going to do

114
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,910
endovascular embolization

115
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,900
or stereotactic radiosurgery or resection?

116
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,580
Endovascular embolization.

117
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,950
Patient requests she's only served green Jello

118
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,010
and that we dim all of our incandescent light bulbs?

119
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,160
Lana has autism.

120
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,770
What're you looking at him for?

121
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,210
It's not like they all know each other.

122
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,270
I was just curious what his thoughts might be.

123
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:42,300
I think we should go with endovascular embolization.

124
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,660
Now you know.

125
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,060
The AVM is dangerous, but the embolization

126
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,970
is a relatively minor procedure.

127
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,030
We'll make a small incision in your leg

128
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,270
so we can insert a catheter into your --

129
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,920
Are you okay, Javi?

130
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,890
The lights aren't bothering you too much?

131
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,160
A little.

132
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,210
Please continue.

133
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,100
We'll insert the catheter into your femoral artery.

134
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,040
Then we'll feed it up into the arteriovenous malform--

135
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,450
You brought a dictionary?

136
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,430
Uh, is there something I'm saying that you don't understand?

137
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,840
Lana loves learning new words.

138
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,390
She's memorized the scientific Latin name

139
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,400
of every bug in South America.

140
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,570
Go ahead, name any six-legged critter.

141
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,070
I love being quizzed.

142
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,670
Rhinoceros Beetle.

143
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,770
Megasoma Actaeon. Found in Guyana.

144
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,310
It's the heaviest insect in the world

145
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,010
and weighs as much as 300 grasshoppers.

146
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,610
Is she right?

147
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,040
I have no idea.

148
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,750
I have to go.

149
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,030
Javi

150
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,950
Javi.

151
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,570
Where are you going?

152
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,010
It's 11:15. I have to be home by noon

153
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,710
to watch "Judge Judy" before work.

154
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,930
I-it's important to us

155
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,570
that your girlfriend doesn't get stressed out,

156
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,140
so we'd prefer it if you stayed with her as long as you can.

157
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,660
Lana's not my girlfriend. We're just roommates.

158
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,400
Still stable?

159
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,770
The diuretics have her O2 SATs up,

160
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,780
- but she's hypotensive. - And we checked every center

161
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,480
approved to implant mechanical hearts,

162
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,720
but none have any record of her as a patient.

163
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,820
Check overseas. I'd start with --

164
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,500
Mom?

165
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,730
Is it her heart?

166
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,900
The implanted device appears to be malfunctioning.

167
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,550
Do you have any contact information

168
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,880
for the surgeon who implanted it?

169
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,980
Yes, of course.

170
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,190
Dr. Li Wei. He's in Beijing.

171
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,230
When did she have it implanted?

172
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,910
A little over nine months.

173
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,050
She just went back for a follow-up exam last month.

174
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,230
She was fine.

175
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,310
Can you fix it?

176
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,120
I'm gonna find out.

177
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,830
Hello.

178
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,810
Hello.

179
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,070
Don't be stupid.

180
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,750
What? There's no cameras in here.

181
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,500
Dr. Lim, Dr. Melendez.

182
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,560
How was your respective weekends?

183
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,010
Good. Checked out some bikes.

184
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,970
- Brushed up on some reading. - Excellent.

185
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,280
I hear the search for Chief of Surgery is back on.

186
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,060
As is our legal department's response

187
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,750
to the DPH complaint against both of you,

188
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,170
so I wouldn't get your hopes up.

189
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,140
Probably just as well.

190
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,280
I'd rather not see the two of you competing again.

191
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,830
You seem to be getting along better.

192
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,760
It's weird.

193
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,370
Is it weird?

194
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,720
They act like a couple, right?

195
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,400
I live with Lea, but we're not a couple.

196
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,320
Yeah, but you wish you were.

197
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,660
Do you?

198
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,460
Lea has a new boyfriend.

199
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,700
You must be a little jealous.

200
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,530
Why?

201
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,810
Lea's my friend and Lea's happy.

202
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:29,830
Okay.

203
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:33,550
Jake, Lea, and I can all be friends together.

204
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,160
Shaun, Lea's new boyfriend doesn't want to hang out

205
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,380
with the three of you.

206
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,570
If Lea really likes this guy,

207
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,970
she's gonna want to spend time just with him.

208
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,930
I know.

209
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,660
For the sex.

210
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,190
Her AVM has microbleeds.

211
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,470
Her risk of rupture is doubled.

212
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,720
They paged Sunny's surgeon.

213
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,090
He's gonna call you in an hour.

214
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,380
Tell them I can't wait that long.

215
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,130
- Her cardiac output is low and - Got it.

216
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,690
He's in surgery.

217
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,760
Excuse me. Uh, Dr. Melendez?

218
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,390
I'm Grace Lee. Sunny Lee's daughter.

219
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,060
They told me downstairs that you're my mother's doctor.

220
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,280
Yes. Get them to send her records

221
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,670
and everything they can about the device.

222
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,840
Manufacturer, model number, manuals.

223
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,050
Your mother's stable, but we're struggling

224
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,510
to get the information we need from her doctor in China.

225
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,890
I don't understand. Her doctor's in China?

226
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,620
Like on vacation?

227
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,370
No, her cardiac surgeon.

228
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,780
Your sister can fill you in on everything we've done so far.

229
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,850
- I really need to get back on this phone call. - Wait.

230
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,500
I don't have a sister.

231
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,250
We met 10 years ago

232
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,600
while I was volunteering at a senior center.

233
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,180
We hit it off.

234
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,200
Neither of us had anyone in our lives at the time.

235
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,600
People assumed we were mother and daughter

236
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,760
because we did everything together.

237
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,100
After a while, we just went with it.

238
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,330
She'll be glad to see you.

239
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,890
You look like you've put your problems behind you.

240
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:33,700
Problems?

241
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,580
She told me about your issues with drugs.

242
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,490
Oh, my God.

243
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,160
She caught me smoking pot.

244
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,850
Once. I was a teenager.

245
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,010
- So you're fine? - Of course I'm fine.

246
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,690
Then you don't really have an excuse

247
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,280
for not calling for 15 years, do you?

248
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,410
They want her back.

249
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,880
They've arranged for transport

250
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,350
they'll do the repairs in Beijing.

251
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,750
Is that safe?

252
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,630
Can she travel for that long in her condition?

253
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,200
It's a specially equipped plane for patients

254
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,050
requiring urgent medical assistance.

255
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,980
And 20 hours in the air is much safer

256
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,990
than at least that long on an operating table here

257
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,580
while we basically fly blind.

258
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,710
- Okay. - Okay.

259
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
Prep her for transport.

260
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,510
The microbleeds indicate

261
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,550
that it may already be starting to rupture.

262
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,420
If it goes,

263
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,880
you could suffer permanent brain damage or death.

264
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,490
Because of that,

265
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,210
embolization is no longer our preferred approach.

266
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,480
We want to open you up and cut it out.

267
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,940
Can you try talking to her?

268
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,180
Just because I have autism doesn't --

269
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,280
I'm not asking you because you have autism.

270
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,130
I'm asking you because you're her doctor

271
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,290
and I'm getting nowhere.

272
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,360
The sting of the Japanese Giant Hornet

273
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,390
can dissolve human flesh and attack the nervous system.

274
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,600
Recommended treatment includes oral antihistamine

275
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,300
and acetaminophen.

276
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,220
Comforting choice of words.

277
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,080
It's 6:30. Dinner time.

278
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,860
I brought burgers and Jello. This one's yours.

279
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,140
Lana can't eat now.

280
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,830
We're trying to schedule a surgery to --

281
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,070
I could die.

282
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,370
The surgery sounds scary but necessary,

283
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,710
so I'll do it.

284
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,360
"...big feet got there first. Johnny stumbled caught himself

285
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,530
and swung silently about at Dove.

286
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,580
'Gosh, Johnny, I'm sorry,'

287
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,190
snickered Dove.

288
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,700
'Sorry, eh, you're going to be a lot sorrier.'

289
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,850
'I just didn't notice.' 'You do that a...'"

290
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,360
Shaun.

291
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,430
What are you doing?

292
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,400
Reading to you from "Johnny Tremain."

293
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,060
You're reading words. You're not reading sentences.

294
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,740
This edition of "Johnny Tremain" is 320 pages long.

295
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,900
To get through the entire thing,

296
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,190
I need to read 270 words per minute.

297
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,680
You don't have to finish the book in one sitting.

298
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,640
Oh, yes, that's how I read novels.

299
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,340
I want to know where the characters end up.

300
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,900
You know what? Let's just stop.

301
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,980
I can go slower.

302
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,730
I-I'm not listening, anyway.

303
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,780
Are you in pain?

304
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,820
- No, no, I'm not -- - You seem fatigued.

305
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,330
You know what? I have a good idea.

306
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,160
Why don't you take out the garbage?

307
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,890
Thank you.

308
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,520
Where is your recycling?

309
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,970
It's under the sink.

310
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,030
Dr. Glassman, this cannot be recycled.

311
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,170
If it's broken, it cannot be recycled

312
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,380
because shards of glass...

313
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,330
I don't care, Shaun!

314
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,830
I didn't ask you to re-sort the garbage.

315
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,620
I just asked you to take it out. Can you do that?

316
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,800
Your call light is on. How can I help you?

317
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,990
Any new symptoms or discomfort?

318
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,800
Lana?

319
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,480
Rhinoceros Beetle...?

320
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,930
I'm gonna get Javi on the phone.

321
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,530
You can talk to both of us.

322
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,010
Do these doors lock?

323
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,300
No.

324
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,750
Do you want them to?

325
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,890
Is there someone you're worried about?

326
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,160
Is it Javi? Or someone else?

327
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,150
I'm nervous about the surgery.

328
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,430
Dr. Lim is an excellent surgeon.

329
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,390
I've seen her do...

330
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,310
I'd like Javi to come and have sex with me.

331
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,230
I think an orgasm would help calm me.

332
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,240
Do the blinds close?

333
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,470
She's gonna need a norepinephrine drip

334
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,580
to maintain her pressure during transport.

335
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,200
Mom?

336
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,090
You look pretty.

337
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,330
Mom, I've been so worried.

338
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,740
You shouldn't have. Teresa takes good care of me.

339
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,850
I'm so glad.

340
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,450
Why did you never call me?

341
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,890
You made it clear you wanted nothing to do with me.

342
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,080
I just wanted to live my own life.

343
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,960
So that's what you got.

344
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,250
Your own life -- without me.

345
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,370
This isn't a good time to --

346
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,640
You were so good,

347
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,830
straight A's, always so smart.

348
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,880
- You threw it all away... - You never understood.

349
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,410
Dad did. Dad wanted me to be happy...

350
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,530
He wanted you to have fun...as a child...

351
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,160
not waste your life.

352
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,340
Singing is not a career.

353
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,120
Sunny, you need to calm down.

354
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,750
Grace, your mother cannot handle this stress right now.

355
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,800
Teresa... Teresa is a teacher.

356
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,260
Mom, stop. Listen to the doctor.

357
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,730
You forgot about me.

358
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,390
I wish you'd... stayed away.

359
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,190
Would...have...

360
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,480
Her arterial blood pressure is dropping.

361
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,290
Start bagging and give her 40 Lasix.

362
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,450
I'm calling a code.

363
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:05,000
{\an1}BGM: Say, Can You Hear by Men I Trust

- Shaun? - Yes, it's Shaun.

369
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,330
I've picked out a very good movie

370
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,970
that we can all watch together.

371
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,930
Not the... not the time, Shaun.

372
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,540
I made popcorn.

373
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,290
That's okay. You just stay here.

374
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,050
Stay here. Sorry.

375
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,440
Shaun, we kind of need some privacy right now.

376
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,850
I also bought orange juice for Jake.

377
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,710
He was looking for some in the fridge.

378
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,520
Okay.

379
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,420
I thought you said you were okay with this.

380
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,350
Jake will like the movie, Lea.

381
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,330
It's about a chef who...

382
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,650
Shaun, but you're not respecting boundaries.

383
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:58,700
If Jake and I are friends,

384
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,710
then we can all spend time together.

385
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,520
Shaun...

386
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,820
Of course, we can all be friends.

387
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,050
That would be great.

388
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,510
It's just sometimes it's gonna be just me and Jake.

389
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,800
Without you.

390
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,690
For the sex?

391
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,690
And some other times, too.

392
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,680
Okay?

393
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,120
Okay.

394
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,410
Just give us a minute

395
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,080
and we can watch the movie in the living room together.

396
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,200
Okay.

397
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,020
Having sex right now is extremely dangerous

398
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,580
for someone in Lana's condition.

399
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,650
I studied the pre-op list of things I couldn't do.

400
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,160
Sex was not on the list.

401
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,440
We'll update the list.

402
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,400
Anything that elevates her blood pressure

403
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,270
could rupture the AVM before we get a chance to remove it.

404
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,790
You'll definitely need to abstain

405
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,360
until you're fully recovered.

406
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,070
Seems like you two are more than just roommates.

407
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,570
Why?

408
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,760
You care for each other, you have sex...

409
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,180
It's convenient. He's available.

410
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,870
And it's frequently better than masturbation.

411
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,230
- High praise. - And he leaves afterward.

412
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,460
She doesn't like being touched when she sleeps.

413
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,510
Are you two exclusive?

414
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,440
Lana and Javi don't have to define their relationship

415
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,690
in order to make it more digestible for you.

416
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,640
Clearly whatever it is, is working for them.

417
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,030
Now, you need to get some rest.

418
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,980
We're gonna do - your surgery at 10:00 A.M.

419
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,200
Sunny's on full life support.

420
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,690
Unfortunately, she can't be flown to China.

421
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,540
Her condition is beyond the scope

422
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,490
of the plane's medical facilities.

423
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,340
Dr. Melendez is discussing next steps

424
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,200
with Sunny's surgeon in China.

425
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,140
No daughter would treat a wonderful woman

426
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,580
like Sunny the way you did.

427
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,520
Does a wonderful woman refuse

428
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,270
to go to her daughter's recitals?

429
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,560
Then, when she gets accepted to Juilliard,

430
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,610
cut her off? Tell her she'll never make it,

431
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,390
that she'll wind up broke and on the streets?

432
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,070
Gently incise the dura.

433
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,030
Nicely done.

434
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,470
And there's our AVM.

435
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,660
Aneurysm clips.

436
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,720
It'd be nice to have what Lana and Javi have.

437
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,270
All the benefits of a relationship

438
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,000
without the emotional baggage.

439
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,960
The emotional baggage is the relationship.

440
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,690
Everybody has their issues --

441
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,970
the point is to sort them out together.

442
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,680
Yeah, that's all it takes --

443
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,930
agreed all the single people in the room.

444
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,900
I can't get under the AVM.

445
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,400
It's much closer to Broca's area than the MRI indicated.

446
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,830
Any damage could destroy her ability to speak.

447
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,960
What if we use stereotactic image guidance?

448
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,820
That would only show us where we are.

449
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,030
It wouldn't tell us if we're affecting function.

450
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,460
But if we track Lana's vocal function during the operation,

451
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,340
it will help us avoid the speech center nerve tracts.

452
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,460
You want to operate on her while she's awake?

453
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,510
We can barely get answers out of her at the best of times.

454
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,400
How do you think it'll go while her skull is open

455
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,680
in the middle of an O.R.?

456
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,970
Well, it's a good thing she has a "roommate" who can help.

457
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,570
It's hard to walk away.

458
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,280
We get angry, we want to run away, but

459
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,950
when it's family...

460
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,250
I'm not angry.

461
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,670
When I got the call telling me she was here,

462
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,130
all I could think about was how my lousy, bitter mother

463
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,090
was about to die alone.

464
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,510
That it wasn't her fault, it was just her nature.

465
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,080
So I needed to be here to let her know

466
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,650
that she was loved in spite of everything.

467
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,530
And then I found out about Teresa.

468
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,070
Saw them together.

469
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,080
Saw that my mother was capable of caring...

470
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,960
...capable of warmth... and love.

471
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,380
Just...not for me.

472
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,300
Dr. Park, please report to ICU 2.

473
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,160
She's bleeding from her cannula site.

474
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,560
She's intolerant to the ECMO.

475
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,900
We can't wait for the new heart.

476
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,060
We have to try and repair this one ourselves.

477
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,670
China thinks Sunny's heart failure is most likely due

478
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,430
to a broken blade in the impeller.

479
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,970
They're suggesting we weld it back together

480
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,870
using an intraoperative device...

481
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,220
which we don't have.

482
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,100
We could repair it with fibrin bioglue.

483
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,980
The blade spins at 1,200 RPMs --

484
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,040
the glue won't hold.

485
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,420
What if we used the schematics to 3D print a new impeller?

486
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,190
The plastic replacement probably wouldn't hold up long-term.

487
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,640
We don't need long-term.

488
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,110
We just need it to work until

489
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,760
the replacement arrives from China.

490
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,430
Let's get these to the lab.

491
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,100
You need me in the O.R.?

492
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,120
Yes.

493
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,500
While you operate on her brain with her head open?

494
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,610
You wouldn't be able to see what we're doing.

495
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,040
You won't see any blood --

496
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:02,320
What's the central illuminance of the O.R.?

497
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,410
- I don't know. - 140,000 Lux.

498
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,890
140,000 Lux is way worse than a grocery store.

499
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,850
I can't go to grocery stores.

500
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,980
We can provide you with protective gear

501
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,520
and eye shades that can filter out some of the lights.

502
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,670
Bright lights are like needles in my eyes.

503
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,850
Megasoma Actaeon.

504
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,370
Found in Guyana.

505
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,990
It's the heaviest insect in the world

506
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,770
and weighs as much as 300 grasshoppers.

507
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,610
Do you like playing insect trivia with Lana?

508
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,960
This is crazy.

509
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,570
You shouldn't do it because of trivia night.

510
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,240
You should do it because...

511
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,240
you love her.

512
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,540
Your life is better with her.

513
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,420
You are a better person with her

514
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:02,670
Y-you need her. That's what love is.

515
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,260
Do it because you love her.

516
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,890
I don't love her.

517
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,440
She's my roommate.

518
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,830
Impeller blades are fine.

519
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,130
The bearings are functioning properly.

520
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,210
Electrical consumption is good.

521
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,320
Maybe the machine isn't the problem.

522
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,650
Heart failure is either caused

523
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,470
by insufficient pumping or a constricted outflow.

524
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,220
Since her "pump" is fine...

525
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,280
She doesn't have valvular stenosis.

526
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,830
The surgeons removed her aortic valve

527
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,250
when they implanted this device.

528
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,940
It could be the aorta itself.

529
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,290
If it narrowed, that would reduce her outflow,

530
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,650
cause her pressure to drop.

531
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,950
If we do an intraop-angio,

532
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,070
we'd see evidence of that.

533
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,570
Call X-ray have them bring a C-arm, STAT.

534
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,490
Dr. Glassman?

535
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,750
I got you cherry Gastrolyte.

536
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,020
Shaun, I'm fine. You can go back to work.

537
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,020
At the Nathan County Fair, I was 14

538
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,180
and you got a cherry slushee and said it was your --

539
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,260
Why do you have an I.V.?

540
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,780
It's just fluid, Shaun, with potassium.

541
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,020
I had a nurse come by from the hospital.

542
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,270
I could have done this.

543
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,440
You're busy.

544
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,740
I'm helping you.

545
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,460
You wouldn't need the fluids

546
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,550
- if you listened to me. - I know.

547
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,490
You didn't drink the Gastrolyte I brought you.

548
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,080
- But now - Shaun.

549
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,250
My head really hurts right now.

550
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,580
How long have you been experiencing pain?

551
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,790
It pretty much never stops.

552
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,690
That's not true.

553
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,110
I asked you if you were in pain last night,

554
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,480
and you said you weren't.

555
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,360
I was in pain last night, Shaun.

556
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,140
I just didn't want you to worry.

557
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,850
Why would you lie about a symptom?

558
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,750
Why would you lie, Dr. Glassman?

559
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,910
- This c-- - This is why, Shaun.

560
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,150
This is why.

561
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,250
I can handle the pain. I can handle the nausea.

562
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,170
- You have nausea? - Yes. Yes, I have nausea.

563
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,590
Okay, you should stop the PCV Chemo.

564
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,680
- Shaun. - Okay, you should stop.

565
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,300
I'm going to call Dr. Blaize.

566
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,470
No. Shaun! No!

567
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,670
I am trying to help you!

568
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,560
I am trying to help you,

569
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,800
but you are not a compliant patient.

570
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,440
- You don't rest... - Shaun...

571
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,070
...when I tell you to rest.

572
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:54,990
You don't follow

573
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,950
- Will you please go?  - the diet that I am giving you.

574
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,530
Shaun, will you just go, please?

575
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,370
- Will you just go? - I-I promised that I would help you!

576
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,860
You're not my doctor, Shaun!

577
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,900
I don't...

578
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,320
I don't want you here.

579
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,870
I'm sorry. I don't want you here.

580
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,550
I don't know how to help you.

581
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,760
Then stop trying.

582
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,770
You're not helping.

583
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,100
You can't help, Shaun.

584
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,800
He's in pain and frustrated and nauseous,

585
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,890
and taking it out on you.

586
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,320
He's in pain and frustrated and nauseous, and I can't help him.

587
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,510
- That may be true. - So what do I do?

588
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,610
When there's nothing you can do,

589
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,350
you have to accept that.

590
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,400
You have to stop trying to help.

591
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,150
That's what he said.

592
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,120
Thank you, Lea.

593
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,330
My life is better with you.

594
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,550
Mine, too.

595
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,550
- We're in the aorta now. - If there is a narrowing,

596
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,370
we should see a sudden rise in pressure.

597
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,290
We should be able to replace the narrow part with a graft.

598
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,100
Metz.

599
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,350
This is a...

600
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,350
Horse.

601
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,360
This is a...

602
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,070
Lana, what do you see here?

603
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,530
We need you to keep talking to us.

604
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,800
Have we already done damage?

605
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,550
It's too soon, I think.

606
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,830
We need to stop.

607
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,730
If we leave the AVM intact and it ruptures,

608
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,960
it will kill her.

609
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,050
Lana, do you understand?

610
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,700
I have to keep going, but if you stop talking,

611
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,230
you may never talk again.

612
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,400
Hand me the bipolar forceps.

613
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,860
Dr. Lim.

614
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,910
There's a Javi Maldonado insisting he should be in here.

615
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,530
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

616
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,390
The surgery was a success.

617
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,430
You can see her when she wakes up.

618
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,610
Thank you.

619
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,890
She wasn't great with you,

620
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,170
but she's great with Teresa.

621
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,630
That doesn't mean she loves her more than you.

622
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,500
It may just mean...

623
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,760
she's not the same person anymore.

624
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,760
As soon as she saw me, she started giving me crap.

625
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,850
The same crap.

626
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,100
Actually, the first thing she said was...

627
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,940
...you look pretty.

628
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,790
Lana, what's on the screen?

629
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,920
A lion.

630
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,100
And what is that?

631
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,480
Lana, what's on the screen?

632
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,490
Javi...?

633
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,670
Madagascan Hissing Cockroach.

634
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,680
Gromphadorhina portentosa.

635
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,600
One of the few insects

636
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,560
who give birth to live young,

637
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,060
rather than laying eggs.

638
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,440
Keep going. You both are doing great.

639
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:24,590
Long-tailed South African Scorpion.

640
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,360
Hadogenes troglodytes.

641
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,090
Reaches a length of over 8 inches,

642
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,410
the longest scorpion in the world.

643
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,180
You'll still need to fly to China to get checked out --

644
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,170
but everything looks great.

645
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,330
Thank you.

646
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,430
Mom, Grace is outside.

647
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,470
I think you should talk to her.

648
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,560
Why?

649
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,140
Because...

650
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,730
she's your daughter.

651
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,950
- I'll step out. - It's okay.

652
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,910
Mom.

653
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,350
Since we stopped talking,

654
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,130
there hasn't been a day I haven't thought about you.

655
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,920
That I haven't missed you.

656
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,720
I'm sorry.

657
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,550
For everything.

658
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,230
I sat in the back.

659
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,740
At the Troubadour.

660
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,050
You were singing "I Wish It Would Rain"

661
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,240
with that band.

662
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,000
I cried.

663
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,170
It was beautiful.

664
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:53,180
Can you tell me your name?

665

{\an7}BGM: Window by The Album Leaf

666
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,970
You remember your name?

667
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,480
Of course I remember my name --

668
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,570
Lana.

669
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,700
And you're Javi.

670
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,580
I think I love you.

671
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,330
I think you do, too.

672
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,970
Do you want to stay in bed with me after we have sex?

673
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,310
No.

674
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,920
Dr. Glassman?

675
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,300
Dr. Glassman?

676
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm not here to help.
