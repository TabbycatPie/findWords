1
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:05,973
Lily, I heard this great joke at work today.

2
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:09,781
Dude, come on. She's not gonna like it.
It's boy-funny. It's not girl-funny.

3
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:13,984
That is sexist! Funny is funny, Ted.

4
00:00:14,093 --> 00:00:17,256
- Lily's cool. She'll appreciate this.
- You're on your own, man.

5
00:00:17,363 --> 00:00:20,593
- Just tell me the joke.
- Okay. Ready?

6
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:25,428
Lily, what's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?

7
00:00:26,705 --> 00:00:28,103
- See? It's funny.
- It's boy-funny.

8
00:00:28,206 --> 00:00:29,333
She's not gonna like it.

9
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:30,737
Why don't you let me decide?

10
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,003
What's the difference
between peanut butter and jam?

11
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:38,715
<i>And then
Barney said the punch line.</i>

12
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:42,411
<i>To this day, it's still the dirtiest joke
I've ever heard in my life.</i>

13
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:44,247
<i>And no, I'm not gonna say it.</i>

14
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:48,220
Yeah, I can't hang out with you anymore.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,824
Oh, come on.
That's a funny joke.

16
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:57,300
- Told you.
- She'll be back.

17
00:00:57,404 --> 00:01:00,702
<i>And we didn't
see Lily for four weeks.</i>

18
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:18,355
<i>Kids, after getting laid off,
I was finally pursuing my lifelong dream,</i>

19
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:22,224
<i>starting my own architecture firm.
All I needed was some clients.</i>

20
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:25,092
I think it's so great that you're
striking out on your own, Ted.

21
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:26,927
- I admire that.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:29,327
And thanks for being so cool
with me using the apartment.

23
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,370
Oh, yeah, of course. Anything you need.

24
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:35,008
Hey, small thing, do you mind
not watching television

25
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,905
- during business hours?
- This isn't working!

26
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,274
<i>I'm sorry. It's just, I can't concentrate
while Wheel of Fortune is...</i>

27
00:01:40,613 --> 00:01:43,309
A penny saved is a Penny Marshall! Yes!

28
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,882
Ted, I know you're nervous,
but you've got to stop procrastinating.

29
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:51,685
You've spent the last two days choosing
the official pen of Mosbius Designs.

30
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,817
Hey, I've made some progress, huh?

31
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:56,226
I've eliminated felt-tip.

32
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:00,164
Who am I kidding?
Felt's back in the ballgame.

33
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:03,767
Hey. You hear there's gonna
be more layoffs?

34
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,237
I know. I'm freaking out.

35
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,434
- Are you worried?
- Are you kidding?

36
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:12,000
The things I know about this company,
I won't ever be fired.

37
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:14,308
I mean, there's a pretty good chance
one day I'll wash up on shore

38
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:17,441
with no fingerprints or teeth,
but I won't be fired.

39
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,543
Well, I wish I had your confidence.

40
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:23,182
Look, you just need a way to make
yourself absolutely essential.

41
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,725
Well, I work harder
than anyone in my division.

42
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:28,853
Yeah. Keeping your job has
nothing to do with hard work.

43
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:30,961
- You need a thing.
- What do you mean, a thing?

44
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:35,400
You know, something that makes you fun
and well-liked, like Marcus Denisco.

45
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:38,035
<i>Marcus Denisco
worked in Account Services</i>

46
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,802
<i>and was perhaps the most expendable
employee at the company.</i>

47
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,707
I brought some donuts.
They're probably stupid.

48
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:46,042
<i>But eventually,
he came to be known as...</i>

49
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:47,672
- Food Guy!
- Food Guy!

50
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,774
Who wants some pulled pork?
Of course you do! Come on!

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,484
I love Food Guy.
They could never lay him off.

52
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:56,648
- Mmm-hmm.
- You know what I love about Food Guy?

53
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:58,989
- He always has food.
- He always has food.

54
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,652
See? That's what you need.

55
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:03,493
You need that thing
that makes you a guy.

56
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,397
Oh, I have that thing that makes me a guy.

57
00:03:06,502 --> 00:03:08,527
Maybe even a guy and a half.

58
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:12,763
Not that thing.
You know, a thing. Like Toy Guy.

59
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,637
Guys, bad news.

60
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:19,408
As your HR rep, I gotta review the new
overtime scheduling policy with you.

61
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:24,210
The good news is we're gonna do it
while wearing Wolverine claws!

62
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:30,523
Section 5A, overtime will no longer
be paid at time and a half.

63
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,457
- This is awesome!
- Claw five!

64
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,996
I love Toy Guy.

65
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,500
See? You need a thing.
Like YouTube Clip Guy.

66
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:50,274
You're right. I do need a thing.

67
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,676
But choose wisely.

68
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:53,841
You don't want to be
Creepy Back Rub Guy.

69
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:57,013
Hey, don't fill up.
Food Guy's got Panna Cotta in his office.

70
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,178
Ooh!

71
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,352
Hey, buddy.

72
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,059
Hey, Douglas.

73
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,889
Wow. You're so tight.

74
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:12,158
I was relaxed about two seconds ago.

75
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:15,629
You're next.

76
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:20,039
Hi. Welcome to Mosbius Designs.

77
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:25,438
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm PJ, Mr. Mosby's assistant.

78
00:04:25,549 --> 00:04:26,983
- Ted, what the hell is going...
- I'm sorry,

79
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,781
we do not interrupt Mr. Mosby
during his brainstorming hour.

80
00:04:31,055 --> 00:04:33,990
<i>It's okay, PJ. That's Robin. She lives here.</i>

81
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:38,491
<i>Oh, I'm sorry for the disturbance, sir.
Do you need anything else?</i>

82
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:42,293
<i>- Well, I wouldn't say no to a cup of...
- You're right there!</i>

83
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,226
So now Ted has an assistant
to help him not do anything.

84
00:04:46,336 --> 00:04:48,567
Hey, PJ's been a huge help to me,

85
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:51,039
setting up the office,
designing the website.

86
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:53,541
And in return, I'm mentoring
a bright, young mind.

87
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:55,772
Ah, yes, the mentoring.

88
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:59,045
I want you to go outside today and simply

89
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:02,311
put your hands on buildings. All right?

90
00:05:02,453 --> 00:05:06,617
Feel the concrete pulse. Listen.

91
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:10,422
Listen to the stories
the stones are telling you.

92
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:14,623
- And pick up my dry cleaning.
- I will.

93
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:18,202
- Thank you so much, Mr. Mosby.
- All right.

94
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:20,495
Hey, Ted?

95
00:05:21,707 --> 00:05:24,403
This table just told me you're a douche.

96
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,908
This whole mentoring thing is
just another way

97
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:29,914
to procrastinate
from actually calling clients.

98
00:05:30,049 --> 00:05:32,814
I'm not procrastinating. I just...

99
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:36,178
I want everything to be perfect, okay?
I only get one shot at this.

100
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:39,121
- Fine, but PJ is not helping.
- Hey, hey.

101
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:42,351
If Ted says that PJ is important
to the company,

102
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,588
then PJ is not going anywhere.

103
00:05:44,697 --> 00:05:47,667
- See? He's very valuable.
- Whoa, whoa.

104
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,859
PJ's a guy?

105
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,835
PJ's not some hot chick you're banging?

106
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:54,064
No, I'm mentoring him.

107
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:57,074
Mentoring.

108
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:01,408
I mentored a young fellow once.
Even made him my wingman.

109
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:06,883
Then, one day, he hired an assistant
to work 10 feet from his bedroom

110
00:06:06,986 --> 00:06:10,354
who, get this, isn't a hot chick,

111
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,358
proving he never listened
to a word I said.

112
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,019
And do you know that young man's name?

113
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,855
- Ted Mosby?
- Maybe.

114
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:19,431
I don't remember.

115
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:21,966
Because he is dead to me!

116
00:06:26,406 --> 00:06:30,275
PJ's gonna be getting
a very confusing card in the mail

117
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,346
along with a garment
that he should by no means

118
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:36,244
wear for three days
and then mail back to me.

119
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:40,886
Hey, Barney.

120
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,956
I thought of a thing
to make me more essential here.

121
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:47,493
I'm Eco Guy, 'cause everybody
loves a guy who recycles, right?

122
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,595
Fired. What else you got?

123
00:06:49,797 --> 00:06:52,129
I thought of a few others. Wacky Tie Guy.

124
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:54,700
- Fired.
- Daily Fun Fact Guy?

125
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,827
Did you know that you're fired?

126
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:58,802
I Know a Good Stretch for That Guy?

127
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:00,701
Downward-facing fired.

128
00:07:00,809 --> 00:07:02,275
Monty Python Guy?

129
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:05,173
We are
the knights who say, "You're fired. "

130
00:07:06,047 --> 00:07:10,485
Wait! Wait! I did use to run a fantasy
baseball league back in law school.

131
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:13,143
That's not bad.
You might be onto something.

132
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:16,314
Awesome. Awesome! I'll be Fantasy Guy!

133
00:07:16,424 --> 00:07:19,155
We'll have to make you Sports Guy.
We already have a Fantasy Guy.

134
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:21,229
- What's up, bros?
- Hey, Frank.

135
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:27,200
Hello?

136
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:30,699
Hey, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.

137
00:07:31,873 --> 00:07:34,706
You're on top of
the Empire State Building?

138
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:39,502
Listen to the old gal.
She's got some stories to tell.

139
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:42,515
Take all the time you need. Okay.

140
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:47,920
Wait a second. "Ted Mosby Home. "

141
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:52,894
Oh, my God, the call's coming
from inside the house.

142
00:08:02,238 --> 00:08:05,604
That's not the Empire State Building.

143
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:14,179
Robin, you cannot sleep with my assistant.

144
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:17,741
I'm trying to run a business here.
How did this even happen?

145
00:08:17,854 --> 00:08:21,120
Well, at lunch, when you go
on your wisdom walks,

146
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,454
it gives me and PJ
some time alone together.

147
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:26,928
Inspiration, do your thing.

148
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:30,658
It always does, sir. It always does.

149
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:36,328
Hey, PJ, I actually have
an architectural question for you.

150
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,404
How does Ted's ass taste?

151
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:42,468
I wouldn't know,
but I assume it tastes like genius.

152
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:49,585
Why is the bathroom locked?

153
00:08:49,686 --> 00:08:52,484
Visitors need to sign in
for the bathroom key.

154
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,549
Listen, Peej, and I want you to think
this over real good before you answer.

155
00:08:57,661 --> 00:09:01,564
Are you telling me that I can't
go to the bathroom in my apartment?

156
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,032
No. I am telling you

157
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:09,038
that you need to ask permission
to use the bathroom in my office.

158
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,269
Why is that so hot?

159
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:15,235
Robin, there are billions
of guys in the world.

160
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,006
Why do you have to
sleep with my assistant?

161
00:09:17,114 --> 00:09:19,845
Ted, when I get off work,
it's 5:30 in the morning.

162
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,044
Do you have any idea
what kind of guys I'm meeting?

163
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,154
I deliver newspapers.

164
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,019
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

165
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:32,185
Don't worry. I'll wash them
before I handle your business.

166
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,159
I live with my mom.

167
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:38,859
At night, we watch TV in her bed.
We call it Cuddle Club.

168
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:44,107
So, you get up really early to
trade on the European stock exchanges.

169
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,770
- What's that like?
- Look, is this gonna happen or not?

170
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,410
Okay, first of all,
I've hung out with Fantasy Guy.

171
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:55,146
You could do a lot worse.
Secondly, this has to stop.

172
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:57,221
Distracting PJ is going
to kill our productivity.

173
00:09:57,322 --> 00:10:01,019
What productivity?
You haven't even called a single client.

174
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,493
Hey, once I get the website up,
the brochures printed,

175
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:06,155
and figure out what trust games
we're going to play

176
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:08,858
at the corporate retreat,
I am making those calls.

177
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,325
Corporate retreat?

178
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:14,270
Mr. Mosby and I are
going camping on the roof.

179
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:17,538
Hey, Sports Guy.

180
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:19,075
I hear people are raving
about your league.

181
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:21,408
It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.

182
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:25,711
Between entry fees and transaction fees
and penalty fees, I'm actually...

183
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:27,548
I'm holding on to a lot of money.

184
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:31,022
Great work, Sports Guy.
That's for last week.

185
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:38,621
<i>60, 80, 100.</i>

186
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:42,527
<i>Okay. This is $18,000 cash.</i>

187
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,301
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

188
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,635
<i>I'll just take it home
and put it somewhere safe.</i>

189
00:10:47,875 --> 00:10:51,605
<i>Okay, just walking down the street
with some money in my pocket.</i>

190
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:55,239
<i>Don't touch the money.
That's so obvious. Just be cool.</i>

191
00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,050
<i>Oh, no. The baby's onto me.</i>

192
00:10:59,184 --> 00:11:01,585
<i>Babies can smell money.
Everyone knows that!</i>

193
00:11:01,688 --> 00:11:04,122
I'm carrying a lot of money!

194
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:09,055
Seriously, dude, I'm not sure
how much longer I can keep doing this.

195
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:12,962
Marshall, last week you were trash
that no one wanted to look at.

196
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,465
Now, you're Sports Guy.

197
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:16,934
- I was trash?
- Last week!

198
00:11:17,672 --> 00:11:20,937
Hey, there's Ted Mosby
of Mosbius Designs.

199
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,771
How's the home office coming, buddy?

200
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:26,904
Well, it was going great till
Robin started banging my assistant.

201
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:30,916
Ted, it's our apartment, okay?

202
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:32,609
You leave a big chocolate cake
on the counter,

203
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:34,347
Mama's gonna cut her off a slice.

204
00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:36,451
I told you.

205
00:11:36,557 --> 00:11:39,253
Hire a cute assistant
that you can sleep with,

206
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:41,760
but instead you hire a cute assistant
that Robin can sleep with.

207
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:43,659
And of course he's gonna sleep
with her, Ted. Look at her!

208
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:46,393
She's the greatest woman on the planet!
I'm getting off topic!

209
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:50,163
You're an idiot!
That's my message! You're an idiot!

210
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:53,399
No.

211
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:58,207
One person storming off isn't enough!
Marshall, storm off with me!

212
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,583
Barney. Dude, why are you this upset

213
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,814
about Ted not having sex
with the people he hires?

214
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:09,856
Because it hurts!

215
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:11,356
It hurts you how?

216
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:14,654
It hurts because I love

217
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,798
Ted

218
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:18,596
having sex with women.

219
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,667
I'm a very dedicated wingman!

220
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,964
Look, Lily's the only person that
I can talk to about this stuff.

221
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:24,436
Just get her to talk to me.

222
00:12:24,539 --> 00:12:26,474
I'll try, but look, there's no guarantees.

223
00:12:26,576 --> 00:12:29,976
She's still really outraged about that joke.

224
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:33,079
That joke!

225
00:12:33,349 --> 00:12:37,012
Tore our little group apart,
pitted people I love against each other.

226
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:38,820
Seriously, I wish...

227
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:42,185
I wish that joke had
never come into our lives.

228
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:47,093
- It's kind of funny though, right?
- It's so funny, man.

229
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:50,124
Hey, good news, PJ.

230
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:53,760
The brochures you designed just came in.
Really interesting choice for the cover.

231
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,772
I like how instead of one of my designs,
you chose this.

232
00:12:58,274 --> 00:13:01,732
You know what?
I must've sent in the wrong photo.

233
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:03,141
You think?

234
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:06,508
Look, PJ, the website's still not done.

235
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:08,847
You didn't even show up
to the corporate retreat.

236
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:11,476
By the way, I saw a shooting star,

237
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,855
and you're late every day!

238
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:15,947
I'm sorry, PJ. I gotta get focused.

239
00:13:16,493 --> 00:13:17,460
You're fired.

240
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:20,757
- You can't fire...
- PJ, you're fired.

241
00:13:20,863 --> 00:13:21,887
Fine!

242
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:28,370
Hey, baby. I just got fired.

243
00:13:29,873 --> 00:13:32,966
Yeah, I'll wait for you at your place.
Okay, bye.

244
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,607
<i>Oh! Wheel of Fortune.</i>

245
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,585
I love having all this free time
to spend with you.

246
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:49,626
- I'm going to kiss you here and here.
- Ooh! Ooh!

247
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,456
And here and here. And...

248
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:53,996
- Oh!
- Please stop.

249
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,229
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

250
00:13:57,335 --> 00:14:00,827
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

251
00:14:05,642 --> 00:14:07,133
You're already sick of him, aren't you?

252
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,179
He's driving me crazy.

253
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,841
When PJ had a job, he was sexy.
He was guardian of the bathroom key.

254
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:18,218
A hot guy telling you
when you can and can't pee?

255
00:14:18,456 --> 00:14:20,220
That's the dream.

256
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:23,260
That's the dream? The dream?

257
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:25,725
Like what Martin Luther King
was talking about?

258
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,460
I have to end it, don't I?
I'm terrible at breakups.

259
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,535
I still have to go a little bit,

260
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,626
but I couldn't be away from you
one second longer.

261
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:34,763
Oh! Listen.

262
00:14:36,574 --> 00:14:38,475
- Dude, I don't know.
- What?

263
00:14:38,576 --> 00:14:40,704
Yeah, it's just...

264
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,175
It's not really...

265
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:45,375
Ix-nay, you know?

266
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,282
Ix-nay on what?

267
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,117
- Not feeling it.
- Not feeling what?

268
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,781
But friends and stuff?

269
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,656
Oh, my God,
this is the worst breakup ever.

270
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,723
You're breaking up with me?

271
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,493
If that's what you want,
I totally understand.

272
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,703
Hey, you still haven't activated that
shortstop the Mariners just brought up.

273
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,170
Gotta have it. Ha!

274
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,635
See, Sports Guy? People love you.

275
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,010
I can't be Sports Guy anymore, okay?
It's killing me!

276
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,911
I keep getting these constant texts

277
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,678
and e-mails and phone calls
in the middle of the night.

278
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:23,352
Sometimes I even think
that I'm being followed.

279
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,690
Hey, buddy.

280
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:29,555
I need you to push that trade through,
so I can set up my new lineup.

281
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,889
Wow, you really carry it in
your shoulders, don't you?

282
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,294
Seriously, it's over.

283
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,301
Do you want me to stop?

284
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:39,630
No.

285
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,034
<i>With Robin and PJ broken up,
I was free to make</i>

286
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,441
<i>some staffing changes in the office.</i>

287
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,414
Hi, welcome to Mosbius Designs.

288
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,678
You got to be kidding me.

289
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,049
<i>And now that PJ
was back at work...</i>

290
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,718
You got to be kidding me.

291
00:15:58,492 --> 00:16:01,859
So, apparently Robin
and PJ are an item again.

292
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:03,827
You got to be kidding me!

293
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,302
Are you all right?

294
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,805
Okay, since Lily's not talking to me,
there's something that I have to tell you.

295
00:16:12,908 --> 00:16:15,467
And this isn't easy to say, all right?

296
00:16:16,444 --> 00:16:18,810
I'm... Wait for it.

297
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:21,713
...in... Wait for it.

298
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,449
...love... Wait for it.

299
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,145
...with... Wait for it.

300
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,084
...a... Wait for it.

301
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:35,963
...certain... Wait for it.

302
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:38,555
- I know that you're in love with Robin!
- What?

303
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:41,329
- Lily told me.
- She told you?

304
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:42,596
Great.

305
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:48,103
I bet you guys have been laughing at me
behind my back the whole time.

306
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:53,040
Actually, in a weird way, we both think
you're kind of perfect for each other.

307
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,741
- You do?
- Yeah. Matter of fact,

308
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,508
we even try to sit
on the same side of the booth

309
00:16:57,618 --> 00:16:59,109
so you two will have to sit together.

310
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:01,212
Really? That's so sweet.

311
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:06,553
But let's be clear. I don't love her. Okay?

312
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:09,560
I just miss her when she's not around.

313
00:17:09,665 --> 00:17:11,497
I think about her all the time,
and I imagine us one day

314
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,067
running towards each other
in slow motion,

315
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:15,602
and I'm wearing a brown suede vest.

316
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:17,302
Are you ever going to
tell her how you feel?

317
00:17:17,606 --> 00:17:20,700
No. Maybe. Never. I don't know. Look...

318
00:17:21,944 --> 00:17:25,435
I just need to get that PJ idiot
away from her.

319
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:28,881
If Lily were here, she'd know
exactly how to get rid of him.

320
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,110
Maybe I can help.

321
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,346
Marshall, you're no Lily.

322
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,514
Lily is a diabolical puppet master,

323
00:17:34,624 --> 00:17:38,389
subtly manipulating every situation
to get exactly what she wants.

324
00:17:38,493 --> 00:17:40,928
She's pure evil, Marshall.

325
00:17:41,197 --> 00:17:44,361
You got a good one there. Hang on to her.

326
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:48,128
<i>Meanwhile, my bizarre
tug of war with Robin over PJ continued.</i>

327
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:52,274
Hey, PJ.
I was about to go on my wisdom walk.

328
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:55,510
- Want to join me?
Hey, PJ.

329
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:58,272
I took the bathroom key without asking.

330
00:17:58,448 --> 00:17:59,779
What are you going to do about it?

331
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,246
Look, you guys are both great,

332
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:06,253
but the truth is I'm taking another job.

333
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,256
These are for you.

334
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,951
Robin, I hope this letter
offers some closure.

335
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,962
Ted, I'm really going to miss you.

336
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:18,793
You can't trade Manny Ramirez
for two middle relievers!

337
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,631
If you veto that trade,
I am out of the league!

338
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:23,366
Okay! Okay! I'll figure it out.

339
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:28,944
Hire the kid to be a paralegal.

340
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:32,175
He gets to do all the work,
and you still get to be Sports Guy.

341
00:18:32,317 --> 00:18:35,582
Pure evil, Eriksen. Pure evil.

342
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:39,719
Hey, thanks.

343
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:46,222
Hey. You okay?

344
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:53,001
- What if I don't think of the books?
- Excuse me?

345
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:54,604
There's this famous architecture story

346
00:18:54,706 --> 00:18:57,573
about an architect
who designed this library.

347
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,298
It was perfect.

348
00:18:59,577 --> 00:19:04,412
But every year, the whole thing would
sink a couple of inches into the ground.

349
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:07,541
Eventually, the building was condemned.

350
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:12,413
He forgot to account
for the weight of the books.

351
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,155
This company, it's just me.

352
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:19,662
What if I don't think of the books?

353
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:24,700
Okay, first of all, nobody goes to libraries
anymore, so who cares about that guy?

354
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:29,102
Secondly, you need to get on the phone
and start calling clients.

355
00:19:29,307 --> 00:19:31,105
The longer I put off starting my own firm,

356
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:35,840
the longer it can remain a dream
and not something I screwed up at.

357
00:19:36,614 --> 00:19:39,674
I mean, it's like I'm giving up
before I even started.

358
00:19:39,818 --> 00:19:41,650
You want to talk about giving up?

359
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:47,488
I used to describe my ideal guy as
funny, smart, passionate, challenging.

360
00:19:47,593 --> 00:19:51,757
And now, apparently,
I will settle for "in my apartment. "

361
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:55,367
I mean, didn't you think you'd
have it all more figured out by now?

362
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:58,834
Are you kidding? By 30, I was
going to be annoyingly successful,

363
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:01,905
married to the perfect woman,
maybe a kid on the way.

364
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:05,033
Instead, I'm just some guy
sitting in his apartment

365
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:08,170
having a staring contest with his phone.

366
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:10,407
And losing.

367
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,352
Hey. You can take that thing.

368
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:34,229
Hi, this is Ted Mosby of Mosbius Designs.

369
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:36,435
I'm calling to inquire about
any design needs you may have

370
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:37,599
now or in the future.

371
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,735
That sounds great, buddy.

372
00:20:38,845 --> 00:20:40,073
- Really? I sound confident?
- Yup.

373
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,512
- Now call an actual client.
- Great.

374
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:48,717
Hey, Food Guy!

375
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,158
Hey, Toy Guy!

376
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:58,528
Who's that guy?

377
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:01,558
He doesn't work here.

378
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,269
- I think we should leave the building.
- Really?

379
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:06,499
This has happened before.
