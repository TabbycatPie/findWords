17
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,750
My name is Barry Allen,

18
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,060
and I am the fastest man alive.

19
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,540
To the outside world, i'm an ordinary forensic scientist.

20
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,840
But secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

21
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,050
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

22
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,390
But when my daughter came back from the future to help,

23
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,980
she changed the present.

24
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,410
And now our world is more dangerous than ever,

25
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,990
and I'm the only one fast enough to save it.

26
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,280
I am The Flash.

27
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,180
Previously on "The Flash"...

28
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,390
To be able to control the weather like that indoors.

29
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,370
He'd have to be a weather wizard.

30
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,530
This is Sherloque.

31
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,610
He's the greatest detective in all the multiverse.

32
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,040
I'm here to catch your killer.

33
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,290
The only part of the satellite

34
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,880
that would have dark matter levels that high--

35
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,710
Is the core, which is where Cicada's dagger came from.

36
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,990
We got a list from FEMA of everyone

37
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,870
who reported injuries the night of the Enlightenment.

38
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,080
Two of them are twins whose father is deceased,

39
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,040
third is a ten-year-old girl

40
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,450
by the name of Grace Gibbons.

41
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,830
So if my dad's right and Cicada's a father, then...

42
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,480
We may have just found his daughter.

43
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,040
Excuse me,

44
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,980
could you tell me where Grace Gibbons' room is?

45
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,890
One sec, let me check.

46
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,390
Actually, yeah, she's that first room right on the right.

47
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,260
Great.

48
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,520
Just where do you think you're going?

49
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,500
Into my patient's room is what I looks like.

50
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm sorry. I am Barry Allen.

51
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,510
I'm with the CCPD.

52
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,890
I was hoping to speak with you, actually.

53
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,980
I'm looking for Grace Gibbons' parents.

54
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,440
Specifically her father.

55
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,780
I'm sorry, but the girl's parents are deceased.

56
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,600
Are you sure about that?

57
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,740
I can show you her charts.

58
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,250
See for yourself.

59
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,530
She came in with a wave of new admissions.

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,060
No legal guardian listed, no next of kin.

61
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,300
The sad truth is,

62
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,520
our staff is the only family this little girl has left.

63
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,400
Okay.

64
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,510
Thank you for your help.

65
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,710
Orlin Dwyer, are you in there?

66
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,520
It's CCPD. Open up.

67
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,900
Orlin Dwyer?

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,940
Hey, listen, man,

69
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,730
I don't care what that guy says,

70
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,210
he was drunk and I was defending--

71
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,410
This is about your sister, Mr. Dwyer.

72
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,990
There's been an accident, a meta attack.

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,940
Careful.

76
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,810
I know, I know.

77
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,160
This is a critical time.

78
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,210
Okay.

79
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,600
Steady hands.

80
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,380
Yeah.

81
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,850
Call time of death.

82
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,320
It's okay. It's a pie.

83
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,140
It's not supposed to be a piece of cake.

84
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,030
Hey, thanks for helping.

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,490
With Cicada's trail running cold,

86
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,150
at least we have the extra day to prepare

87
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,290
for our first Thanksgiving at the loft.

88
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,570
What about Joe and Cecile?

89
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,660
They're celebrating with Cecile's family this year.

90
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,600
So, yeah, this year it's just gonna be the five of us.

91
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,700
I'm down.

92
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,730
Six, actually.

93
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,590
Killer Frost just RSVP'd.

94
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,860
What--you guys can just talk to each other now,

95
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,580
even without the mental activity dampener?

96
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,410
Yeah, today's actually the first time.

97
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,310
Oh, gosh.

98
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,140
- Hi, guys. - Yo.

99
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,040
Sorry we're late.

100
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,970
It seems like everyone and their grandma is getting

101
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,530
pre-holiday manis and pedis.

102
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,760
Ooh, let's take photos and post them

103
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,620
on that old-fashioned Insta thingy that you guys use.

104
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,020
Those two seemed to have really patched things up.

105
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,190
Yeah, Nora's getting closer to Iris than she is with me,

106
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,120
and the timing couldn't have been better.

107
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,110
What do you mean?

108
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,600
I mean, Nora was so young

109
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,090
when I disappeared in her future,

110
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,730
so this would be her first memory of Thanksgiving

111
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,180
with both her parents.

112
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,730
Feel like it's my job to make it

113
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,530
the most perfect Thanksgiving ever.

114
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,140
And #HandModels.

115
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,320
Wow, I feel famous already.

116
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,700
Oh, man.

117
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,820
Mom, um...

118
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,930
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,910
Sorry for what, Nora?

120
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,700
For not giving you a chance to show me how great you are.

121
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,060
This year I'm just really thankful to get to know you.

122
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,700
The real you.

123
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm thankful too.

124
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,870
You know, the West-Allens have never missed a Thanksgiving.

125
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,170
No gorilla army, no evil speedster,

126
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,780
no giant wormhole in the sky could break that streak.

127
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,360
Yeah, the singularity.

128
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,870
So the Flash Museum has a 3-D model of Dad

129
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,730
just running straight into it to save the city.

130
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,940
God, it must have been so epic to be there.

131
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,220
Actually, it was...

132
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,610
terrifying to be there.

133
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,390
We didn't know if your dad was gonna come back.

134
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,030
Ronnie didn't.

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
What?

136
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,880
The museum says that-- that Dad just saved everybody.

137
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,950
I guess there's things the museum left out.

138
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,780
Like your Dad giving himself to the Speed Force

139
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,970
to save the city.

140
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,270
That was another time we said good-bye thinking...

141
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,610
might be a one-way trip.

142
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,990
Sounds a lot like what took him from us in the future.

143
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,780
I didn't know Dad had so many close calls.

144
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,140
Look, your dad is always gonna

145
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,760
wanna put his life on the line for others.

146
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,130
That is what I love most about him,

147
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,200
but, yeah, it-- it does keep me up at night.

148
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,780
Did he come back?

149
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,260
No, the records I falsified convinced him for now.

150
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,690
So we're safe?

151
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,320
Orlin, I think you need to stay away.

152
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,650
Good idea.

153
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,700
I won't visit till after the weekend.

154
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,090
No, I think you need to stay away for good.

155
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,550
It's getting too risky.

156
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,890
You want me to give up Grace?

157
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,880
No, no, no, listen,

158
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,630
you can't put me on hold.

159
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,570
I don't care about this next of kin crap.

160
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,160
I don't want this kid. Hello?

161
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,980
Hello?

162
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,100
Damn it.

163
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,160
What?

164
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,310
It's breakfast.

165
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,650
Yeah, it is. Um...

166
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,670
Okay.

167
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,270
Now look, it's only a few days old.

168
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,070
It's still good, I swear.

169
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:31,950
I don't understand.

170
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,910
Explain again to me

171
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,420
what the difference between this day

172
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,180
and every other day in America?

173
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,190
It's a holiday when we all get together

174
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,540
and celebrate and eat a ton of food.

175
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,310
Like, a gross amount.

176
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,330
Again, what the difference between this day

177
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,960
and every other day in America.

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,260
- That's legit. - Hi, guys.

179
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,090
What's going on?

180
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,420
This guy, he try to explain the Thanksgiving holiday.

181
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,780
He's failing miserably. What is this holiday?

182
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,170
- Please explain. - It's very simple, actually.

183
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,460
It's just about getting together

184
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,380
to celebrate our loved ones and family.

185
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,100
So simple, this is why I don't understand this holiday.

186
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,190
I don't have any family.

187
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,000
Didn't you have, like, seven marriages?

188
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,990
I did have seven marriages.

189
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,260
Five wives, seven marriages, but no family.

190
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,350
This holiday is a cruel holiday.

191
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,020
What's going on?

192
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,770
I'm seeing a massive electrical surge

193
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,100
at the downtown power station.

194
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,890
Barry, Nora, you're up.

195
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,780
Guys, what's the problem?

196
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,120
Everything looks--

197
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,960
I think we found it.

198
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,060
- It's lightning. - Skies were clear a minute ago.

199
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,360
That storm must have come out of nowhere.

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,590
Uh, we got a bigger problem.

201
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,430
There's an experimental cold fusion core

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,790
from Mercury Labs in the plant, and if it blows...

203
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,760
It could take out the whole block.

204
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,830
I see it.

205
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,020
Nora, you've got to evac all the workers to safety.

206
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,680
- Barry-- - Yeah, I know, I got to grab the core.

207
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,960
No, no, no, something doesn't feel right.

208
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,550
Just listen to Iris. Grab the workers from inside.

209
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,190
Dad!

210
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,850
Dad!

211
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,500
Dad!

212
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,010
You guys, he's not breathing.

213
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,030
He's going into cardiac arrest.

214
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,110
She needs to restart his heart.

215
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,920
What-- how do I do that?

216
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,320
Rub your hands together to create lightning,

217
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
and then give him a chest compression.

218
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,410
Okay! Okay.

219
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,150
Come on. Come on. Come on.

220
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,270
It's not working!

221
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,560
We lost him.

222
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,030
No! No!

223
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,360
No!

224
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,850
Please. Please. Please.

225
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,830
He's back.

226
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,550
- I promise I'm okay. - Caitlin.

227
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,800
His vitals are stable. Speed healing to the rescue.

228
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,840
He shouldn't have needed rescuing.

229
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,150
Nora, I know you're upset,

230
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,220
but if that core would have exploded

231
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,500
it would have caused a lot of damage.

232
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,650
It did cause a lot of damage. Dad died.

233
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,780
We made the best decision we could, given the circumstances.

234
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,060
Maybe someone else should be making our decisions.

235
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,810
Wow, all right, well,

236
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,950
so much for mother-daughter holiday time.

237
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
She did just have to bring me back to life.

238
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,270
- Let's give her a minute. - Okay.

239
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,080
In the meantime, where did that storm come from?

240
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,880
A storm like that coming and going,

241
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,410
disappearing in a matter of minutes,

242
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,070
it shouldn't be possible.

243
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,230
Unless someone was making it possible.

244
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,730
I mean, we've seen that before.

245
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,280
- Weather Wizard. - But Mark Mardon is serving

246
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,500
a life sentence at Iron Heights.

247
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,540
Let's make sure he's doing just that.

248
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,110
Let us know if any other weather anomalies

249
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,410
pop up on the radar.

250
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,510
Okay.

251
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,180
Will do.

252
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,770
I think it's time for operation: Save the Turkey.

253
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,350
What...?

254
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,930
Art is therapy.

255
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,920
So, Sherlock--

256
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,010
Sherloque, simple pronunciation.

257
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,900
We heard what you had to say about not having a family.

258
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,600
Right. And we here at Team Flash are

259
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,830
sort of a family, and you're becoming part of that family,

260
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:02,200
so we would like to invite you

261
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,940
to celebrate Thanksgiving with us.

262
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,310
Caitlin, I'm afraid that I must decline, all right?

263
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,010
Because I don't have a lot of reason to celebrate,

264
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,410
and you of all people should sympathize with that.

265
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,330
- Why should I sympathize? - You lost your father, right?

266
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,330
And then you find him only to discover that his body

267
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,420
is being possessed by a icicle demon

268
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,860
who's trying to kill all of Team Flash,

269
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,050
yourself included. Not great, right?

270
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,840
Okay, that's enough, Debbie Downer.

271
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,930
Don't listen. You know what?

272
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,850
Maybe you should lay off the paint fumes.

273
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,330
Do you know what, young Ralph Macchio?

274
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,910
You have nothing to celebrate either, right?

275
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,850
What your last year has been, huh?

276
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,340
Let me recap for you. First, heartbreak.

277
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,530
And then second, Cicada crushes your powers

278
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,210
forcing you to fake your own death,

279
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,310
also not great, and as for me,

280
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,410
multiple divorces have left me

281
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,860
with a mountain of debt that's insurmountable.

282
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,700
So this past year, not been very kind to any of us.

283
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,000
Pardon.

285
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,150
She's had a few recent outbursts,

286
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,950
and we don't allow cursing here.

287
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,880
This type of behavior cannot continue.

288
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,500
Anyway, that's the long and short of it.

289
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,010
I'll give you two a moment.

290
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,750
You called a kid a rat bastard?

291
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,270
What's wrong with you? Don't you know

292
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,220
you can't go around saying stuff like that?

293
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,340
Why?

294
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,600
Well, 'cause then I get a phone call.

295
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,080
You know, I had to take off work to come down here.

296
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,700
- You don't even like your job. - What?

297
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,690
You stay on the couch all day,

298
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,990
and then when work calls

299
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,560
you curse and slam the door.

300
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,240
"Rat bastards."

301
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,460
Look, I get where you heard it.

302
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,910
All right, but you can't say those words.

303
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,320
- Rat bastard! - Hey, quit it.

304
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,550
- Rat bastard! - Stop.

305
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,090
- Rat bastards! - Hey, listen to me!

306
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,800
I'm supposed to be the parent here.

307
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,380
No, you're not a parent!

308
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,380
Parents are supposed to make the world better for their kids.

309
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,240
You make everything worse. I hate you,

310
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,930
and you hate you too.

311
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,870
You have to excuse our dim lighting.

312
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,100
Today's storm out at the power plant

313
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,920
knocked out our main generator,

314
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,040
So we're working off a backup for the time being.

315
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,450
So does that mean you can't dampen

316
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,110
the meta prisoner's powers?

317
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,670
Prison-wide dampeners are down,

318
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,780
but we got every inmate into meta cuffs incident free.

319
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,180
I hope you include that in your article about our readiness.

320
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,960
After the corruption of the last warden,

321
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,450
I am eager to assure the public

322
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,450
that their safety is in good hands.

323
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,940
Now, our CSIs, which inmate did you need to see?

324
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,500
And he's been here all day?

325
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,310
Never once out of our sight.

326
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,740
There was a crime committed today

327
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,310
with an MO similar to Mardon's.

328
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,150
Can I take a look at the security tapes?

329
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,110
Anything for our friends in the press.

330
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,420
Well, this is a bust.

331
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,200
Yeah, looks like you died for nothing.

332
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,190
Nora, hey, hey, look.

333
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,130
This has been a rough day for you,

334
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,370
but you can't blame Iris for what happened.

335
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,830
She's doing the best she can.

336
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,320
Besides, we both decided on the plan.

337
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,470
Oh, I know.

338
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,750
What the...?

339
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,460
Hey, don't mind me.

340
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,440
I'm just here to pick up my dad.

341
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,320
Did she say "Dad"?

342
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,610
Joslyn?

343
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,100
It's Joss.

344
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,250
Bring me my father! Now!

345
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,910
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

346
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,970
We'll see about that.

347
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,720
Bring my dad to Porter Plaza in one hour,

348
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,720
or Central City is gonna get wrecked.

349
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,040
I didn't know that Joslyn was busting me out.

350
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,590
I didn't know she'd do half the things she does.

351
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,550
I haven't spoken to her in years.

352
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,210
And you expect me to believe she woke up

353
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,800
this morning and was like, "You know what?

354
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,980
I wanna break my dad out of Iron Heights."

355
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,280
I get it, but it's the truth.

356
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,680
Joss was born when me and her mom were still in high school.

357
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,700
I never could work out how to be with that woman.

358
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,850
Then when Joss came I thought the best thing to do

359
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,240
was to focus on my career.

360
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,610
Your criminal career?

361
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,250
That's why I left her with her mom.

362
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,240
Least until she ran away because some of falling out.

363
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,250
What happened with Joss and her mom?

364
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,020
The last time I spoke to her

365
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,180
she told me that her and Joss are broken.

366
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,920
You know how it is.

367
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,600
Sometimes mothers and daughters break

368
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,590
and there ain't no fixing 'em.

369
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,650
Okay, watch your step.

370
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,580
And open your eyes.

371
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,240
Whose house is this?

372
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,440
It's my cousin Robbie's.

373
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,790
He doesn't live here anymore, but he said

374
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,460
if I fix it up, we could stay here.

375
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,540
What's this?

376
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,430
That is a dollhouse.

377
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,940
Or it can be

378
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,970
once we build it, and, you know, you can...

379
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,650
Pick out furniture, and colors,

380
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,940
or wall paper, decorate it how you want.

381
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,740
I know we didn't get off to the greatest start

382
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,480
these past few months.

383
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,160
Okay...

384
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,250
it was a lousy start.

385
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,570
But I want to fix all that.

386
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,390
Well, I was thinking that while I work on this place,

387
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,570
we could work on this one too... together.

388
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,090
Listen, you were right, kid.

389
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,680
I do hate me.

390
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,590
I don't really know any other way to be,

391
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:48,430
but I want to do right by you, Gracie.

392
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,320
I want to keep you safe, and warm, fed...

393
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,520
You know, just...

394
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,120
give you all the things a kid should have.

395
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,210
Let's start with the dollhouse.

396
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,130
Okay.

397
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,700
Okay.

398
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,440
How's Dad's interrogation going?

399
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,630
Well, we'll know in a minute. Hopefully, he'll find something

400
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,360
that'll help us profile Mardon's daughter.

401
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,440
Okay, well, let me know.

402
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,910
Nora, look, listen, I know you're upset with me

403
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,270
for sending your dad into that situation earlier,

404
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,610
and I just--

405
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,170
- I wanted to say that I-- - Mom, it's okay.

406
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,860
I'm not upset with you.

407
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,550
- You're not? - No, we're good.

408
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,150
I-I promise.

409
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,950
Okay, cool.

410
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,310
That's the other thing, celebrating the decimation of an indigenous culture

411
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,780
so a bunch of greedy colonizers can get their turkey-lurkey on.

412
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,610
Do you know about this? Do you know about the sham?

413
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,530
The sham we call "Thanksgiving."

414
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,570
Okay, I'm sorry, am I missing something?

415
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,070
Since when did you guys become anti-Thanksgiving?

416
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,770
Since a bunch of guys wearing hat-buckles

417
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,530
fed us some old bull, wrapped in lies,

418
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,640
stuffed in propaganda.

421
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,650
Actually, I think the hat-buckles weren't real either.

422
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,780
Don't encourage him.

423
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,040
You get it.

424
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,650
Did you get anything from Mardon?

425
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,150
No, nothing that'll help us find his daughter.

426
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,450
What about you guys? What'd you dig up?

427
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,970
Meet Joss Jackam.

428
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,770
She is a delinquent teen turned amateur stormchaser.

429
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,200
A self-taught expert in theoretical meteorology.

430
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,750
How do we know she's a storm chaser?

431
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,750
'Cause Helen Hunt here has a blog.

432
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,100
Mm-hmm. She lost her grant from the Science Center

433
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,500
for doing too many dangerous experiments on the weather.

434
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,410
Well, look like she's way beyond the experimental phase.

435
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,540
Ooh, Weather Witch?

436
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,850
I'll allow it.

437
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,320
Dad, that weathervane,

438
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,060
doesn't it look a lot like...

439
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,860
The staff she was carrying, yeah.

440
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,540
Cisco, can you pull up the security footage

441
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,870
from her attack on Iron Heights?

442
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,970
Sure can.

444
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,640
It's infected with a satellite shard.

445
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,860
She's got meta-tech.

446
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,070
Like Spencer Young's phone.

447
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,270
Look, she has instant lightning on command.

448
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,600
There's no way you're gonna be able to get that staff from her.

449
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,960
She's gonna have to give it up willingly.

450
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,440
Okay, listen, we got 20 minutes

451
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,860
before she destroys the entire city,

452
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,360
so what is the plan?

453
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,090
We only have one choice.

454
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,710
We give her what she wants.

455
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:26,270
No Weather Witch in sight.

456
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,010
Okay, Singh cleared the perimeter,

457
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,060
so it's free of civilians.

458
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,330
And our satellites are on weather watch

459
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,300
for our Weather Witch. Nothing yet.

460
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,060
What?

461
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,870
I wouldn't say nothing.

462
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,530
My data leaves me to conclude

463
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,140
that there is artificially-created

464
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,240
pressure system of uncertain origin

465
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,770
headed rapidement toward the downtown core.

466
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,600
Listen, Galileo, you can lick your finger

467
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,220
and stick it in the wind all you want.

468
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,100
Why don't you leave the actual calculations

469
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,630
to actual compu-- oh, for Christ's sake.

471
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,040
And your exasperation leads me also to conclude

472
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,820
that you have realized, although late,

473
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,200
that once again I'm right. I'm right. I'm right.

474
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,050
I'm right. I'm right--

475
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,560
That's enough out of you.

476
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,150
She's here.

477
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,620
So the rotten apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

478
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,220
You're a poet. Awesome.

479
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,040
Where's my dad?

480
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,750
All right, Joss, we held up our end of the bargain.

481
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,860
You got dad.

482
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,820
There's no reason to hurt anybody--

483
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,960
Ah, so boring. Come on.

484
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,070
We'll handle it from here.

485
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,240
Hey, baby girl.

486
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:35,680
Dad.

487
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,950
That's a pretty cool staff.

488
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,310
Would you just--how about you just power that thing off for a sec

489
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,600
and let your dad try.

490
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,720
Try this.

491
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:00,480
Oh, oh, don't feel bad. He was a selfish dick

492
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,020
who abandoned his family.

493
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,240
Anyway, thanks for helping me drop a truck on my dad.

494
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,080
Uh...guys?

495
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,640
What now?

496
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,920
I didn't see the hummer coming.

497
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,290
I'm so pissed!

498
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,930
This city will drown,

499
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,720
crumble, burn, because of you!

500
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,170
Thanks.

501
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,410
I'm gonna follow her.

502
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,560
Wait, are you serious right now?

503
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,320
- What? - You almost just died.

504
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,620
Again, and you don't seem to care.

505
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,500
Where is this coming from?

506
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,870
You know how dangerous our job is.

507
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,390
Yeah, but I don't want to lose you again,

508
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,210
but you don't seem to give a damn if you lose me,

509
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,010
and-- and all for your job.

510
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,870
Nora.

511
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,740
How long you been holding that one in?

512
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,710
My best guess? My whole life.

513
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,190
Growing up without you, I was so angry...

514
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,720
but you were my hero, so...

515
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,310
it was easier to put my anger for you not being around

516
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,620
on criminals and meta-villains...

517
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,330
a lot of times on Mom.

518
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,630
But when I saw you die today

519
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,840
it reminded me that

520
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:03,170
I'm mad at someone else about losing you...

521
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,430
You.

522
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:10,950
I get it.

523
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,110
It's not easy having a parent

524
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,090
who puts their life on the line for others.

525
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,200
I remember feeling the same way about Joe

526
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,730
being a cop when I was a kid.

527
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,110
No, it's not the same thing.

528
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,230
Did he ever have to say good-bye to you knowing

529
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,170
that he wasn't coming back?

530
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,140
You did...

531
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,180
and you're gonna do it again.

532
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,250
Nora, you got to remember you're talking about

533
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,090
a future that we might be able to avoid.

534
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,270
We still have time to find our way to a solution,

535
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,300
and we will.

536
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,240
But there is a solution.

537
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,460
It's just one that you don't want.

538
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,800
Give up being The Flash.

539
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,960
Come on. It's the only way to guarantee

540
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,170
that you won't disappear again in the future,

541
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,310
or any other time.

542
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,320
- Nora. - Come on. Think about it.

543
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,540
You're not the only hero.

544
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,630
Let the others protect the world.

545
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,700
You don't have to keep sacrificing yourself.

546
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,120
You give your life again and again.

547
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,180
How many times does it have to be you?

548
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,350
It hurt so much losing you

549
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,240
when I didn't even know you,

550
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,660
but now after all of these months

551
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,240
getting to know you I just--

552
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,770
please, Dad, don't make me go through it again.

553
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,760
I don't want to go through it again.

554
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,050
Nora, people need The Flash.

555
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,300
I need my dad.

557
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,180
This is the third ice cream of the day, you know?

558
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:17,070
Something fishy's going on here.

559
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,490
Okay, you got me.

560
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,540
We're celebrating

561
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,990
because this is a very special day.

562
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,350
One year ago today,

563
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,880
I made you a promise

564
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,880
that I would turn my life around

565
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,420
and make things better for you.

566
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,810
I can honestly say that my life

567
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:40,320
is a million times better than what it was.

568
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,670
And it's all because of you, Gracie.

569
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,990
So I got you something.

570
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,010
It's the set I wanted.

571
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,350
I thought your little dollhouse could use a family.

572
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,110
I already have one.

573
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,880
I love you, kiddo.

574
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,650
Purple.

575
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,450
You know, I think four ice creams in a day would be the--

576
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,370
Gracie, run.

577
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,090
Run. Run. Come on!

578
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,230
Go this way! Go this way!

579
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,180
Help me!

580
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,030
Help me, please!

581
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,470
- Sir. - Somebody!

582
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,780
Save her, please.

583
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,410
Get him on a table.

584
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,560
Move!

585
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,530
Gracie...

586
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,770
Help her...

587
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,340
On the eve of Thanksgiving,

588
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,990
reports of devastating weather phenomena

589
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,050
are streaming in from all over the city.

590
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,870
The exact cause of these disturbances remains unknown.

591
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,230
I can't believe she's actually willing

592
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,270
to level the city to kill one man.

593
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,550
She doesn't know where Mardon is.

594
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,900
It's overkill, but it's the only option we've left her.

595
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,490
Well, Caitlin's on radar,

596
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,890
and Cisco's trying to juice the satellites,

597
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,290
but there's interference. We can't locate Joss.

598
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,260
You okay?

599
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:21,740
Look, babe, you're gonna find the words

600
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,460
to make her understand. I know it.

601
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,610
Not sure I have the words to make myself understand.

602
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,940
She's got a point.

603
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,190
We got a hit on Joss.

604
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,040
She's at Sheldon County Airport.

606
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,390
Barry, you got to move.

607
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,390
You're good?

608
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,580
Barry, do you have eyes on Joss?

609
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,590
No, she's damaged the terminal so badly

610
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,200
the hangar's the only safe place.

611
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,330
I'm evacuating everyone trapped on the tarmac.

612
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,860
I think I can bring Frost out. What can we do?

613
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,090
Flood control

614
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,300
down at the Marina.

615
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,080
Guys, how do we fight weather?

616
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,360
We fight weather with weather.

617
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,320
Nora.

618
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,690
We still have Mardon's weather wand.

619
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,770
I need you to get it from the archives

620
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,070
and take it to Barry, okay?

621
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,020
Okay.

622
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,430
- Hey. - Hey.

623
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,520
Mardon's wand?

624
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,230
Cisco says you can use it to counteract Joss's weather.

625
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,470
Where is she?

626
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,390
Last chance. Where's my Dad?

627
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,880
Joss, you know we can't give him up.

628
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,810
Then you know what happens next.

629
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,020
Joss, I deceived you, okay? Not them.

630
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,030
You want make someone pay, it's me.

631
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,930
This is how you make heroes pay!

632
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,710
By the beard of Zeus,

633
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,620
she's making a tornado out of lightning.

634
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,550
Cisco, how do I use this wand to stop this?

635
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,260
You can attract all the lightning to the wand.

636
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,430
That'll take down the tornado,

637
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,390
but all that energy will go through your body.

638
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,170
You'll be a human lightning rod.

639
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,010
It's okay.

640
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,630
I know you have to go.

641
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,850
Run, Dad.

642
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:35,910
Run!

643
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,680
Back. Everybody, back.

644
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,690
Barry? Nora, do you see him?

645
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,330
I, uh...

646
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,960
I...

647
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,650
I see him. He's still here.

648
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,200
We live in a world full of meta-phones

649
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,060
and meta-weathervanes.

650
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,700
What's next? My electric toothbrush?

651
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,690
Till we figure out how to remove those shards,

652
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,700
- better safe than sorry. - Yeah.

653
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,980
Well, now that Mardon and his daughter

654
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,210
are all tucked away in Iron Heights.

655
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,180
What do you say we spend some time with our own family?

656
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,160
Well, might just be us and Nora this year.

657
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,570
Caitlin and Cisco are skipping Thanksgiving.

658
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,210
What? Why?

659
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:55,070
- Don't even ask. - What?

660
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,480
A toast to...

661
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,230
The thankless.

662
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,260
- The thankless! - The thankless!

663
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,470
The thankless!

664
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,630
Allez-oop.

665
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,650
All right, boys, I'm tapping in.

666
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,600
Okay, let me get this straight.

667
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,790
You two losers are sitting here

668
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,540
in what I can only assume is the cantina of a starship,

669
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,290
drinking and eating terrible food

670
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,080
when you could be drinking and eating amazing food

671
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,750
with people who actually care about you.

672
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,100
All right, all right, look.

673
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,340
When you put it like that...

674
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,880
- She has a good point. - You have a good point, yeah.

675
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,500
And, by the way, I have the least to celebrate this year

676
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,130
because I spent most of it unconscious.

677
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
You nerds come to Thanksgiving, or what?

678
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,780
So it wasn't so much the taste as it was the crunch.

679
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,110
Wait, are you actually saying--

680
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,910
Yes, that was the year I found out

681
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,820
why Grandma Esther's yams tasted so good,

682
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,530
because she never cleaned her favorite skillet.

683
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,980
I take it this was also the year

684
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,580
you stopped eating Grandma Esther's yams?

685
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,340
Uh-uh, I didn't say all that.

686
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,820
Allow me to propose a toast.

687
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,940
Well, first to clean dishware,

688
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,780
and also to--to family, all right,

689
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,980
and to friends, old and new.

690
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,370
And to the colonizers who conquered this land...

691
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,420
- What? - And...

692
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,950
-the colonizers who grabbed-- - Remember-- no...

693
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,630
What they want, they just take what they want.

694
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,210
- Yes, I know, but our-- - To taking what you--

695
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,760
That's not--you know what? Let's go.

696
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,530
- Right now. - Okay, you know what?

697
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,340
I think that it's time to go carve a turkey.

698
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,780
Great.

699
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,180
Nora.

700
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,180
Um, we didn't have a chance to talk since the airport.

701
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,730
Oh, Dad, I know what you're gonna say,

702
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:58,940
and you don't have to.

703
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,540
I saw what it was like

704
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,460
when you hesitated to save those people

705
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,730
because of me, and I felt...

706
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,300
- Horrible? - Yeah.

707
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,700
And I never want to feel like that again.

708
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,040
I get it.

709
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:19,000
Sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself to save others.

710
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,270
Even if it means leaving your family behind.

711
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,750
Not exactly.

712
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,820
Look, when I ran into that storm I was thinking

713
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:31,020
I want to save everyone, but...

714
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,010
the person I was thinking about the most was you.

715
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:39,000
- Me? - Yeah.

716
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,660
I don't choose being The Flash over being with my family.

717
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,900
I'm The Flash for my family,

718
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,940
and I don't have to run to the future

719
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:51,760
to understand why I sacrificed myself.

720
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,440
I'd do it to save, and your mom,

721
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,740
all the people I love.

722
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,610
You know, maybe one day if I train enough,

723
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,350
I'll be able to save you.

724
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,450
I don't doubt it.

725
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,040
- All right, come on. - Okay.

726
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,820
- Ah, yes. - All right.

727
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,160
- Hey, thank, God. - Carve the turkey.

728
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,200
- Yeah, baby. - Here we are.

729
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,810
- Each person gets a turkey. - No.

730
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,600
We have the one for everyone.

731
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,250
- You all right? - Just Dad with a knife,

732
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,620
It's a little-- - It's the most fun part.

733
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,850
Oh, you're very good at that.

734
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,220
Am I?

735
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,180
Orlin.

736
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,600
I told you it's too risky.

737
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,200
CCPD's already looking for you. What are you doing here?

738
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:52,070
It's Thanksgiving, Doc. I'm here to be with my family.

739
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,800
I want you to be optimistic,

740
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,600
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

741
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,050
As far as how long,

742
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,710
with all the brain hemorrhaging she suffered,

743
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,960
you have to prepare yourself for the possibility

744
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,050
that she may never wake.

745
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,070
This is all my fault.

746
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,800
No, it's these metas.

747
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,890
Wreacking havoc unchecked.

748
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,420
She didn't deserve this, Mr. Dwyer,

749
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,300
and neither did you.

750
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,550
This was the scene Tuesday night as, once again,

751
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,010
The Flash saved Central City from certain destruction.

752
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,810
After a world-wide power outage

753
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,800
blanketed every country in darkness,

754
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,090
a bizarre purple...

755
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,650
The destructive phenomenon emanated

756
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:57,270
from a satellite that had fallen

757
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,990
into a decaying orbit.

758
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,260
Thankfully, before the satellite could

759
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:03,980
strike the city and create what scientists believe

760
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,540
would have been "A catastrophic event,"

761
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,630
The Flash was able to destroy it.

763
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,200
Once again, residents of our proud city,

764
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,440
and perhaps the entire world owe The Flash

765
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,610
and his allies...

767
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,800
A new meta was last seen jumping off a building

768
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,970
in order to evade capture after stealing jewels...

769
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,620
It was reported that he escaped Flash's grasp

770
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,890
after hijacking an armored vehicle.

772
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,910
I'm gonna make this right, Gracie.

773
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,680
Every meta...

774
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,840
will die.

775
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,030
Guys, this better be good.

776
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,930
Yeah, we've got an after-Thanksgiving tradition called sleeping,

777
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,680
so what's up?

778
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,130
It's good. Trust us. Detective.

779
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,800
Well, it occurred to me that if you,

780
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,630
monsieur and madam West-Allen,

781
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,770
you want to spend this holiday with your family.

782
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
Well, perhaps your meta-killer does as well.

783
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:28,480
So I had monsieur Cisco hack into the CCTV footage

784
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,660
of the hospital and this what we got.

785
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,800
Ever since Grace arrived,

786
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,070
only one man has come to visit her.

787
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,410
Every day.

788
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,410
Including tonight.

789
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,310
Team Flash, I give you...

790
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,860
Orlin Dwyer, also known as...

791
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,930
Cicada.
