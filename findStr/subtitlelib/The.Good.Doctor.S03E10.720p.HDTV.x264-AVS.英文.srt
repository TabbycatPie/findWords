1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:04,430
Shaun, you need to make a decision.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,000
Shaun, please. Your mom's been calling.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,860
Your father wants to talk to you.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,940
Say something, will you? Say anything.

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,550
I know he wasn't a good father,

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,770
but he's the only father you've got.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,560
If ever there was something you wanted to say to him,

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,840
now's the time.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,900
I have nothing to say to him.

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,830
Okay.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,990
But if he wants to say something to me before he dies,

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,120
I'll listen.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,800
Okay.

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,880
- Can you come with me? - Yeah, of course.

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,190
Can I bring a friend?

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,600
I don't think that's a good idea.

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,860
I want to bring a friend.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
Shaun, how -- how long have you been dating Carly?

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,370
I don't want to bring Carly.

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,450
I want to bring Lea.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,850
Morning.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,640
Never seen you here before.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,870
Yeah, I just joined.

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,990
I'm not really a gym person,

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,640
but I, uh, thought I'd try something new.

26
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,530
It's a great way to clear your head.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,750
Yeah. Um...

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,770
About last night.

29
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,290
In the stairwell.

30
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:36,940
Thanks.

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,620
No problem.

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,290
I know the boss isn't always the person you want to talk to,

33
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,180
but...if you ever do...

34
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,160
Thanks again.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,770
But I'm fine. Really.

36
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,420
Is that guy serious?

37
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,330
That's it. That's it.

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,840
I'm gonna say yes, since that's Art Kalman.

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,650
Raiders' offensive tackle.

40
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,950
That's like 800 pounds.

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,070
It's the NFL.

42
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,680
No pain, no paycheck.

43
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,830
Come on! Awesome, man. We got you.

44
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,770
One more.

45
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,700
- Naw, man. - Come on, you're good.

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,670
One...more!

47
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,860
Push, push, push!

48
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,810
Push!

49
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,080
Are you okay?

50
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,540
- Can you hear me? - Don't move.

51
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,330
I'm a doctor.

52
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,360
Where's it hurt?

53
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,960
It doesn't, but...I can't move.

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,200
Call 911.

55
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,050
I can't feel my legs!

56
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,140
Listen to me, Art.

57
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,240
You need to hold still.

58
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm gonna take good care of you.

59
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,630
I can't feel my legs!

79
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,860
You know, you don't have to go if you don't want to.

80
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,950
I can handle it.

81
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,070
I don't want to go.

82
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,490
I obviously have no wisdom to offer --

83
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,220
my own family's a disaster.

84
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,980
And things are crazy-busy at work now.

85
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,110
Okay.

86
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,370
But he's my best friend,

87
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,720
and he seems to need my support,

88
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,780
so there's no way I'm gonna say no.

89
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,050
Well, don't force yourself to go if you don't want to.

90
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,410
Sounds like you don't want me to go.

91
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,670
It's just that it's --

92
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,530
it's gonna be intense, it's gonna be emotional.

93
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,160
Really?

94
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,900
I thought going home to visit the parents

95
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,860
who abused and abandoned him would be a fun family reunion.

96
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,000
Why are you getting defensive?

97
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,090
Why do you have to be controlling?

98
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,310
How am I controlling?

99
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,940
- I'm just ask-- - I'm ready to go.

100
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,770
We have to be at the airport 90 minutes prior to our flight.

101
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,530
Can you believe the size of this guy?

102
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,660
Exactly why I don't watch football.

103
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,040
Size is more important than talent or skill.

104
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,940
I'm gonna guess you never played.

105
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,640
Half the players are morbidly obese.

107
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,250
Yet they can still run 4.9 forties and

108
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,050
have 36-inch verticals.

110
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,770
It doesn't matter what kind of body you're born with.

111
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,840
No one makes it to the top

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,150
unless they're incredibly talented

113
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,010
and they worked their ass off.

114
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,310
It's just stupid.

115
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,260
Jocks get paid millions and get treated like royalty,

116
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,880
whereas people who do jobs that actually matter --

117
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,690
teachers, cops, doctors --

118
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,430
we can barely pay our student loans.

119
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,640
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

120
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,490
I'm gonna guess someone else's.

121
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,680
I'm not doing that anymore.

122
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,730
Just like that?

123
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,690
Just like that.

124
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,040
This is bad.

125
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,790
Burst and facet fractures -- T3 and 4.

126
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,980
Retropulsion of bony fragments in the spinal canal.

127
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,160
But look here.

128
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,050
There's no transectional bruising in his spinal cord.

129
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,100
We're in boarding group A, right?

130
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,350
Boarding group A,

131
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,670
no emergency exit row,

132
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,240
right side of the plane.

133
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,260
Have you spoken to Carly?

134
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,330
Not since last night.

135
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,290
Well, don't you think you should call her,

136
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,990
let her know where you're going and why and with whom?

137
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,360
She won't worry.

138
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,340
She knows I don't like my dad,

139
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,060
so I won't be sad when he dies.

140
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,020
Shaun...

141
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,700
call her and let her know

142
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,820
that you're -- you're gonna miss her.

143
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,960
She must know I'll miss her.

144
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,220
Tell her anyway.

145
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,900
You know it must be good advice if he and I actually agree.

146
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:47,130
If we can stabilize the fractures

147
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,140
and decompress the cord,

148
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,890
we should be able to reverse the paralysis.

150
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,900
Fantastic. We should start a preoperative Riluzole regimen.

151
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,910
No.

152
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,370
There's an experimental hypothermia treatment

153
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,240
shown to reduce cord edema and cell death

154
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,680
when done prior to surgery.

155
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,830
It's also shown a high rate of

156
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,960
bradycardia and arrhythmias,

157
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,340
which is the last thing I want to deal with during surgery.

158
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,970
There's an infusion protocol we can follow

159
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,270
to reduce that risk.

160
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,920
The faster we reduce the inflammation --

161
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,850
Thank you, I appreciate your input,

162
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,940
but as Art's surgeon --

163
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,920
She's right.

164
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,540
And what makes you think you're doing the surgery?

165
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,820
Dr. Melendez, I appreciate all you've done.

166
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,950
But now that he's stable, my staff will take over.

167
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,890
Well, actually, that's not your call.

168
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,020
Or mine.

169
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,680
You're a pro athlete with a pro athlete's body.

170
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,850
And you need a surgeon who understands

171
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,740
that this is not just about making sure you can walk again.

172
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,330
It's about making sure you can run, block,

173
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
so you can get back out on that field

174
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,180
and play at the top of your game.

175
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,870
This is what I do.

176
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,330
Sure, you do knees, you do shoulders.

177
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,890
Have you ever done anything like this before?

178
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,520
Robert Stokes, last year.

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,660
Donny Lund a few years before that.

180
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,090
Both players had similar spinal fractures.

181
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,440
Actually, not that similar.

182
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,770
This is more like what I see in high-speed motorcycle accidents.

183
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,630
And unfortunately, I've seen a lot of those.

184
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,800
Not one or two every few years, but 20 to 30 every year.

185
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,150
That's what I do.

186
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,910
This is gonna be awesome.

187
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,320
Have you got something to say?

188
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,410
I get you want to deal with stuff on your own,

189
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,660
for people to mind their own business.

190
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,260
But whatever pressure you've been feeling is still here.

191
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,570
If you don't seek help or rely on other people,

192
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,230
you will fail.

193
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,650
Thank you.

194
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,980
Should we get back to work now?

195
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,570
Ladies and gentlemen,

196
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,800
welcome to Cheyenne Regional Airport.

197
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,700
I changed my mind.

198
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,480
I don't want to hear what he has to say.

199
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,070
I think you do want to hear what he has to say.

200
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,760
No. No.

201
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,900
- Okay - I don't want to be here.

202
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,550
- Shaun - Okay, why don't we just sit in the car for a while?

203
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,270
There's no rush.

204
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,550
Okay.

205
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,650
I want to go.

206
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,320
Now.

207
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,270
Shaun, take a deep breath.

208
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,290
No, thank you.

209
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,780
I don't want to take a breath.

210
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,840
- Shaun, just - No, I want to go!

211
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,890
- I want to go. - Okay.

212
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,940
- I want to go now! - Okay.

213
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,410
- Go now! Please! - Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay.

214
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,760
- Okay. Okay. - Please.

215
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,390
Here we go.

216
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,300
- Please, okay, go now. - We're going back to the hotel.

217
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,430
- I'm sorry. - Go now!

218
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,580
- We'll settle in at the hotel - Go now!

219
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,890
- We're going. - It's gonna be okay.

220
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,540
- We're going. - Go now, please!

221
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,400
We'll settle in at the hotel, and then we'll see, okay?

222
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay.

224
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,080
How you doing?

225
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,050
I'm ready to go home.

226
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,610
We're not gonna be able to do that until tomorrow,

227
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,820
so...

228
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,140
maybe we should try to make the most of our visit.

229
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,620
Shaun, it's okay.

230
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,960
Just because your dad's dying

231
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,250
doesn't mean he deserves to be forgiven.

232
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,420
And if he dies before you're ready to listen

233
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,050
to whatever he wants to say,

234
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,220
that's his fault.

235
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,390
His.

236
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,400
Not yours.

237
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,590
There is someone I'd like to see.

239
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,420
He's in a peaceful place.

240
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,460
He's decomposed.

241
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,000
Except for maybe his face and hands.

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,960
That's where they concentrate the embalming fluid

243
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,930
because that's what people see at the funeral.

244
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,580
Are you ready?

245
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,170
Okay.

246
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,870
Well, you take as much time as you need.

247
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,050
Your Mom and I are gonna wait in the car.

248
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,710
I'm not going with you.

249
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,510
Shaun

250
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,040
I'm never going with you.

251
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,280
What are you gonna do?

252
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,740
You gonna live in that bus?

253
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,210
You gonna eat out of the trash?

254
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,770
- Come on, let's go home. - Leave me alone.

255
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,720
It was an accident, Shaun.

256
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,260
A horrible, tragic accident.

257
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,860
And I know you're hurting.

258
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,040
I promise you, he's hurting, too.

259
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,350
You don't get over losing a child.

260
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,260
He wants to see you.

261
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,970
What do you want to do?

262
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,560
But you don't have to.

263
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,610
If you're not ready yet, that's fine.

264
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,250
Whatever feels right for you, that's what you should do.

265
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,660
Hi, Shaun.

266
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,340
Hello.

267
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,790
Can I hug you?

268
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,060
No.

269
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,710
Got venous blood return.

270
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,970
I'm in the subclavian.

271
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,900
Next step?

272
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,270
Large bore catheter.

273
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,350
FYI, he grew up poor.

274
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,950
He bought his mom a house with his signing bonus.

275
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,210
Set up a business for his brother and cousins

276
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,290
Focus on the procedure.

277
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,170
You can write his biography on your own time.

278
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,550
Infusing 400 milliliters cooling saline.

279
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,440
Core body temp down to 94.5.

280
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,630
He's bradycardic.

281
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,790
Push 0.5 atropine.

282
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,500
Let's get a transcutaneous pacer on him.

283
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,560
Low charge.

284
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,690
We can't allow the contractions to increase the dislocation

285
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,840
and sever the cord.

286
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,950
Charge at 40.

287
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,300
40 milliamps.

288
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,360
Clear.

289
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,820
Can't feel his pulse.

290
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,410
10 milliliters epi on a long needle.

291
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,490
We should start compressions.

292
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,060
No, we can't risk further dislocation.

293
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,780
- Should we up the... - No. Keep it at 40.

294
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,700
40 milliamps.

295
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,620
Clear.

296
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,690
No response. Give him more atropine.

297
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,810
Should we push more IV epi?

298
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,730
No, that'll take too long.

299
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,180
We should increase the charge by 100.

300
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,330
No, we can't take that risk.

301
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,800
Better paralyzed than dead.

302
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,130
He's got a pulse.

303
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,860
Core temp?

304
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,020
93.2.

305
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,910
That's cool enough.

306
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,500
Let's monitor him closely overnight,

307
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,320
make sure that his BP and heart rate are steady

308
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,690
before we start surgery.

309
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,500
Shaun, I'm sorry.

310
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,960
It's just... I always wanted a son.

311
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,100
I mean, a boy that I could teach to hunt and fish.

312
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,470
Play catch with.

313
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,160
Have a beer with.

314
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,810
A little kid that I could carry around on my shoulders.

315
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,110
And I got angry.

316
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,450
Not at you, but just me.

317
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,550
I was pissed off at myself.

318
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,870
Because I couldn't help my son.

319
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,940
No matter how hard I tried, I always failed.

320
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,700
But you were a good kid.

321
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
And you've become a great man.

322
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:47,200
Better than I could ever dream of.

323
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,590
I'm proud of you, Shaun.

324
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,920
And I love you.

325
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,180
I just wanted you to know that.

326
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,930
You...

327
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:52,250
...are not a good person.

328
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,260
You always drank too much beer,

329
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,250
which made you stink.

330
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,130
Shaun.

331
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,170
And you always blame other people.

332
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,590
And you hit and punch other people --

333
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,950
Shaun, please calm down.

334
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,970
You killed my rabbit.

335
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,660
- Shaun - you killed my rabbit.

336
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,560
And you killed my brother!

337
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,980
S-so I don't care that you're dying!

338
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,610
I don't care at all!

339
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,350
Shaun.

346
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,250
You done yet? We need to follow up on Art.

347
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,360
I'll be right there.

348
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,740
You said that 10 minutes ago.

349
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,810
I am just finishing up some charts.

350
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,380
The charts on your phone?

351
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,190
Satisfied?

352
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,590
Nice. Very dramatic.

353
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,480
And stupid.

354
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,110
People need to be able to page you.

355
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,480
Tequila, stat.

356
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,620
No, thank you.

357
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,680
We need to do something fun.

358
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,280
Like go for a swim.

359
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,760
There is a gorgeous lake a few blocks away.

360
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,230
I saw it when we first drove in.

361
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,980
It's the Rocky Mountains. It's December.

362
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,890
So? My family used to do

363
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,920
a New Year's Eve "Polar Bear Plunge"

364
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,130
at our lake house.

365
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,430
Sometimes, my dad would --

366
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,310
The diagnosis is correct.

367
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,930
There is no hope. He's going to die.

368
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,970
Yeah.

369
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,950
Shaun, I don't think you're done with your dad.

370
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,390
You can't help him medically, but you can talk to him.

371
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,470
Yes, you have every right to be angry,

372
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,650
but I'm not so sure that's all you feel.

373
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,990
I think we should go home to the motel,

374
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,570
get some sleep, wake up in the morning,

375
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,670
go to the Hilltop, get some pancakes,

376
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,690
and then see what happens.

377
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,600
Sounds like a very wise plan.

378
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,900
Good.

379
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,950
On the other hand, there is that lake.

380
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,410
- Oh, my God, do you ever stop? - No.

381
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,770
I'm going with Lea.

382
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,770
- Yes! - The lake is probably half frozen.

383
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,520
I'm going with Lea.

384
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,380
Let's do this, Shaunie.

385
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,010
Your heart is stabilized,

386
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,410
and surgery will likely be in a few hours.

387
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,050
You're gonna walk out of here and probably even play again.

388
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,300
You want to know why I chose you guys?

389
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,760
Because I thought you didn't care if I played or not.

390
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,770
I hate football.

391
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,560
I always have.

392
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,540
But you've dedicated your entire life

393
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,940
to being the best at it.

394
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,200
I was 6'1", 250 pounds in 8th grade.

395
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,420
When I got to high school, the coach,

396
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,280
he didn't ask me to play -- he told me.

397
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,330
But from the first practice, it was...

398
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,250
It's not who I am.

399
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,840
 I wanted to quit, but...

400
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,510
college coaches started calling my mom.

401
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,010
She insisted it was God's plan.

402
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,600
Why else would I be born this way?

403
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,540
But you're not a kid anymore.

404
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,190
You must have plenty of money.

405
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,210
Everybody depend on me --

406
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,320
my mother, my brother,

407
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,490
my cousins, my friends.

408
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,660
They'd hate me.

409
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,930
So I prayed to get hurt,

410
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,580
but no matter how out of control I played...

411
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,940
I thought I'd go to the weight room

412
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,880
and blow out a knee, and then this happens.

413
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,520
He wants closure. There's no such thing.

414
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,170
Some relationships are just not meant to be,

415
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,580
which is why people should focus

416
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,250
on nurturing the ones they have,

417
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,740
instead of trying to salvage the ones they've lost.

418
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,790
Talking's done.

419
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,500
Time for action.

420
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,540
Okay. 

421
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,670
What's wrong?

422
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,860
The majority of drownings are caused

423
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,900
by swimming after drinking alcohol.

424
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,360
Not gonna be a problem, because we're not gonna swim.

425
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,720
It's way too cold for that.

426
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,870
We're just gonna run in

427
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,410
until it's deep enough to dunk our heads

428
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,150
and then run back out.

429
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,500
- No. - Oh, come on.

430
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,040
It'll feel amazing.

431
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,130
Like -- like you've just had an awesome massage.

432
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:02,500
I don't like massages.

433
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,670
It's not at all like a massage.

434
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,210
It's -- it's not even close to that.

435
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,090
I don't like the mud.

436
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,130
It gets between my toes.

437
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,340
You won't even feel it.

438
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,120
Your toes will be numb as soon as they hit the water.

439
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,970
But that feeling when you get out --

440
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,500
that warm, tingly sensation --

441
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,960
it's the best high there is.

442
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,880
That can't be true.

443
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,430
Okay.

444
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,640
Guess I'll just have to go solo, then.

445
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,700
You're not supposed to swim alone.

446
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,220
I'm not alone. You're here.

447
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,890
And you're gonna regret it if you don't come with me.

448
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,440
Suit yourself.

449
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,340
Lea?

450
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,930
Lea!

451
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,000
Damn it!

452
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,230
If only I could hold my breath longer than 15 seconds!

453
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,360
That is not a good joke!

455
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,380
I knew you would forgive me.

456
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,860
Shaun's not an angry person.

457
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,760
Right?

458
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,360
He can be insecure, maybe.

459
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,860
Uh, stubborn sometimes.

460
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,600
But he's not an angry person.

461
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,320
And if that's the last conversation

462
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,520
he has with his dad, then --

463
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,700
then all I've succeeded in doing is ripping open an old scab,

464
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:03,860
and this whole trip was a mistake.

465
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,920
His dad was a disaster,

466
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
and his mom did nothing to protect him.

467
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,090
So, I just don't think you need to be so worried

468
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,490
about getting him to forgive.

469
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,480
You're gonna become a-a parent someday.

470
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,010
Maybe. Right?

471
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,090
I...

472
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,640
Well, if you do,

473
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,690
you're gonna be responsible for another human being.

474
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,650
And your first job, number one,

475
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,240
is to keep them alive.

476
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,210
You're gonna make mistakes,

477
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,960
but you hope that one mistake doesn't scar you for life.

478
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,470
I'm...

479
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,090
I'm sorry.

480
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,900
Shaun's dad needed a little bit of mercy.

481
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,240
We'll leave in the morning.

482
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,470
I don't like the mud.

483
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,320
It gets between my toes.

484
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,240
Aw, come on, buddy. We can't turn back now.

485
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,060
We're almost to the waterfall.

486
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,450
I can wait here.

487
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,540
I-I'll meet you when you come back.

488
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,660
No, no, no, no, you're too young to be left alone.

489
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,420
I tell you what -- I will help you

490
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,000
clean every speck of dirt off your feet as soon as we cross.

491
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,070
I don't want to.

492
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,300
Okay, well, what if I carry you?

493
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,260
You won't even touch the water.

494
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,050
No, I don't want to be picked up.

495
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,540
It'll be five seconds.

496
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,470
For the most amazing mountaintop picnic ever!

497
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,810
And I-I got all your favorite foods.

498
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:28,560
I got, uh, peanut butter and jelly on white bread,

499
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,840
I got apples, chocolate chip cookies.

500
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,550
Aw, Shaun, come on.

501
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,780
- No! No, put me down! - Alright, alright, alright, alright.

502
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,240
No, no, no, buddy, it's okay, it's okay.

503
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,660
- It's okay! - Let me go! Put me down!

504
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,280
- Okay. Okay. - Let me go!

505
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,440
Alright, alright. Alright.

506
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,980
You did good.

507
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,580
You're okay. We're good. It's all good.

508
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,420
Alright, let's do this.

509
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,650
Put your shoes on, bud.

510
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,030
These are as good as I remember.

511
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,820
There's a flight at 11:00,

512
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,330
if that's what you want.

513
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,450
Are you good with that?

514
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,330
Shaun?

515
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,750
You never could get enough of Hilltop's pancakes.

516
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,420
Can we talk?

517
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,470
It'll just take a minute. I promise.

518
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,930
Okay.

519
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,840
Inflammation's definitely been reduced.

520
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,620
- Well done, Doctor. - Thanks.

521
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,140
And get the rods and place set screws...

522
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,470
- Got it. - ...while Park and I compress the spine

523
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,500
above and below the fracture to improve alignment.

524
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,390
All I ever wanted was to figure out a way

525
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,470
to move past... everything.

526
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,310
I wanted us to be a family again.

527
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,230
Why did you stay with him?

528
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,780
I don't know.

529
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,530
I just...

530
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,910
I love him.

531
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,020
You loved him more than me and Steve?

532
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,000
No.

533
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,760
No.

534
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,050
That isn't true.

535
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,890
I just...

536
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,310
I guess I knew what I could do for him.

537
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,770
With you...

538
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,980
I don't blame you for hating us.

539
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,570
We were young.

540
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,240
Stupid.

541
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,820
Not like people today.

542
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,330
Like Dr. Glassman.

543
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,000
There was so much we didn't understand about...

544
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:57,920
you.

545
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,130
And what you needed from us.

546
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,850
We've missed you.

547
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,230
So much.

548
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,240
Can I hug you?

549
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,640
I need to talk to my dad.

550
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,490
I thought you went home.

551
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:08,880
I couldn't let you put me on your shoulders.

552
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,510
Or let you hug me.

553
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,980
I couldn't make you happy.

554
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,200
You are my son.

555
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,580
You're Shaun.

556
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,460
I forgive you.

557
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,720
And...

558
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,770
...I don't want to punish you anymore.

559
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:05,060
I don't want to punish you.

560
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,820
You're not like other people.

561
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,990
You're s-so smart.

562
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,380
But weak.

563
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,300
You're like a spoiled, little baby.

564
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,760
He's delirious from the morphine.

565
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,030
You understand. He -- he doesn't know what he's saying.

566
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,100
You're damn right Stevie's death wasn't my fault.

567
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,060
It was yours. 

568
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:48,290
He was always trying to impress you.

569
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,540
- You and that damn rabbit. - Ethan, shh!

570
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,860
- Shaun, let's go. - Stop. 

571
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,950
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

572
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,800
Get out of here.

573
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,990
- Run away again! - Come on.

574
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,370
Go ahead. Run away again!

575
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,380
Now what?

576
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,050
You need to tell them.

577
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,760
If they care about you, they will understand.

578
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,150
No one will blame you for retiring

579
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,220
after breaking your back.

580
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,350
Nearly paralyzing yourself.

581
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,770
My mom worked minimum-wage jobs her whole life.

582
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,290
Raised an entire family on her own.

583
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,130
And you think I should tell her I want to quit the NFL

584
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,400
because I don't "like" it?

585
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,410
Because it's not "fun" for me?

586
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,010
You think I don't understand what it's like

587
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,750
to need to please your mother.

588
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,550
No matter how hard you work,

589
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,720
you still owe something more.

590
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,760
And every good thing that has ever happened to you

591
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,640
is pure luck.

592
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,940
But every bad decision you make,

593
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,270
that's the real you.

594
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,030
And you deserve to suffer.

595
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,810
Your mom called.

596
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,770
Your dad passed 30 minutes ago.

597
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:04,620
You want to stay for the funeral?

598
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,460
No.

599
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,090
I want to go home.

600
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,130
Okay.

601
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,560
You want me to stay for a while?

602
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,640
Talk?

603
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,400
No.

604
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,990
Well, we don't have to talk. We can just sit.

605
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,240
Or, um, go for a walk.

606
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,870
I'm...

607
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,710
tired.

608
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,510
I should go to sleep.

609
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,300
Okay.

610
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,770
Good night.

611
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,470
Hey, it's Claire.

612
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,730
Yeah, I know. I, um...

613
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,360
I got a new phone with a different number.

614
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,320
I changed my mind.

615
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,570
I think we should meet up... tonight.

616
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,040
Ma?

617
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,870
Yes, baby.

618
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,960
I'm here.

619
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,300
There's something I need to tell you.

620
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,710
I'm sorry for making you meet me after hours like this.

621
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,610
I just...

622
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,010
I really needed someone to talk to.

623
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,030
Of course, Claire.

624
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,800
I'm always available for my patients.

625
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,410
- Come on in. - Thanks.

626
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,150
Shaun?
