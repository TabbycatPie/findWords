57
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,963
他在医院
He's at the hospital.

58
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:42,165
他还在医院 你是个天才
He's still at the hospital. You're a genius!

59
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:44,267
我真想接受表扬 但事实是
Well, I'd love to take credit, but the truth is,

60
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:46,001

- 那应该让我开车 - 为什么

我生无可恋 开车的时候也一样
I have nothing to live for, and I drive like it.

65
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:53,610
好的 就这么办
Okay, let's do it.

66

00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:05,001
等等 我又收到一条
Wait, I'm getting another one.

157
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:06,836
"卡噶了" 这都看不懂啊
"Ink obrvs whiz." These are nonsense.

158
00:05:06,837 --> 00:05:08,171
他嘴被堵住了
He's been gagged.

159
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:09,972
堵嘴怎么会影响发信息呢 斯库利
How would that come through in a text, Scully?

160
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:12,208
等下 我知道怎么回事了
Wait a minute. I know what's going on.

161
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:14,743
他是偷偷在口袋里发的信息
He's secretly trying to text us from his pocket.

162
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:17,647
我死后 请代我向凯文问好
When I die, please give Kevin my regards.

163
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,149
要我跟他说什么
What shall I tell him?

164
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,415
"向你问好"
"Regards."

165
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:22,519
斯库利 这些像是你天天发的那种奇怪信息
Scully, these look like the weird texts you always send.

166
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,321
触屏手机无法对我的手指做出正确反映
Touch screen phones don't respond correctly to my fingers.

167
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:27,724
因为我被电击过太多次了
It's because I've been electrocuted so many times.

168
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,160
等等 我们肯定可以逆推出来
Hold on, I bet we can reverse engineer this thing.

169
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:31,461
斯库利 把这个输到你手机上
Scully, type this into your phone.

170
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,329
"五下里地" 两个I
"Inib rue tiid." Two "I"S.

171
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,835
出来的是 "窝在老定"
It came out, "Imm on rha rooj."

172
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:41,237
"我在楼顶" 他在楼顶
"I'm on the roof." He's on the roof!

173
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,239
上帝保佑你 斯库利 也保佑你那奇怪的坏死的手
Oh, God bless you, Scully, and your weird, dead hands.

174
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,474
你和希区柯克太犀利了
You and Hitchcock are killing it!

175
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,412
- 我的天啊 - 赶紧走吧
- Oh, my God. - Let's just go.

176
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:50,880
不许动 放下武器
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

177
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:52,682
再靠近一步 我就杀了你们警监
One more step, and I kill your captain.

178
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:54,217
好了 鲍勃 你们在这干什么
Come on, Bob. What are you doing up here?

179
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:55,351
为什么来楼顶
Why are you on the roof?

180
00:05:55,352 --> 00:05:56,886
天啊
Oh, my God.

181
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:58,454
你准备像美式忍者那样
You're gonna zip-line off of this thing

182
00:05:58,455 --> 00:05:59,756
靠滑索下去
like an American ninja.

183
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:01,391
真是个酷炫的脱身计划
That is such a cool escape plan.

184
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:03,059
实际上 我是想把雷蒙德推下去
Actually, I was gonna throw Raymond over the side

185
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,961
伪装成观鸟时发生的意外
and make it look like a bird-watching accident.

186
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:06,429
得了吧 你真以为会有人...
Oh, please, do you think anyone's gonna actually...

187
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,664
天才
It's genius.

188
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:09,199
一个街区外有一只红尾鹰
There's a red-tailed hawk roost a block away,

189
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,434
而我像傻子一样 兜里揣着一副
and I've got a pair of micro binoculars in my pocket,

190
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:12,635
袖珍望远镜
like a fool.

191
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:13,970
好的 我承认我错了
Okay, well, I stand corrected.

192
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,871
放下枪投降吧
Just drop the gun and surrender.

193
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:17,006
如果你指证菲吉斯
If you turn on Figgis,

194
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:18,541
最后结果未必会太糟
this doesn't have to end badly for you.

195
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,476
你还留着那份包含所有对他不利证据的档案吗
You still have that file with all the evidence against him?

196
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:21,911
你是说你交给我的那份
You mean the one you handed me?

197
00:06:21,912 --> 00:06:23,813
当时那是个好主意 我们都这么以为
That was a good idea at the time; we all thought that...

198
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:25,248
还留着 那份档案在一个安全地点
Yes, that file's in a safe place,

199
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:26,516
你们永远别想找到
and you're never getting it.

200
00:06:26,517 --> 00:06:28,117
别傻了 鲍勃 你寡不敌众
Don't be foolish, Bob. You're outnumbered.

201
00:06:28,118 --> 00:06:29,652
寡不敌众个臀部
Outnumbered, my bottom.

202
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:31,020
菲吉斯的人已经在路上了
Figgis's men are on the way.

203
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:32,622
是的 我叫了援兵
Yes, I called for backup.

204
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:34,457
警监 趴下
Captain, down!

205
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:38,393
泰瑞把你放倒了
Oh-ho, Terry took you down!

206
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:39,528
时机刚好 警长
Nice timing, Sarge.

207
00:06:39,563 --> 00:06:40,730
你怎么知道我们在这
How'd you know we were up here?

208
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,432
警监把所有的H都用巧克力标出来了
Captain marked the Hs in chocolate,

209
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,834
我一下就联想到了我们现在所站的地方
which I instantly connected to the giant helipad H

210
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:46,236
直升机降落点上的H
we're on right now.

211
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:48,304
真酷
Oh. Cool.

212
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:50,175
真酷 我们也破解出来了
Cool, yes, we also solved that.

213
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,369
直接跑来了楼顶
Came straight up here to the roof.

214
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,854
一秒钟都没瞎逛
We didn't wander around even for a second.

215
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:54,360
我们都聪明着呢
We're all smart.

216
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:57,625
聪明 这是个很好的藏身处
Smart. This is a good hiding space.

217
00:06:57,922 --> 00:06:59,636
斯库利 你怎么躺下了
Scully, why are you lying down?

218
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,661
因为有床啊
'Cause there was a bed here.

219
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:02,162
你还把鞋脱了
You took your shoes off.

220
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:03,497
好吧 一队可疑的黑色SUV
All right, look, a bunch of sketchy, black SUVs

221
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:04,898
刚停在了外面
just pulled up outside.

222
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,167
不是菲吉斯的人 就是碧昂斯磕到了脚趾
Either it's Figgis's guys, or Beyoncé stubbed her toe.

223
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:08,769
不要开这种玩笑 杰克
Don't even joke about that, Jake.

224
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,771
否则我们的首要任务就要改一下了
That would be our new number one priority.

225
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:12,373
我们得请求增援
We have to call for backup.

226
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:15,342
菲吉斯在纽约警署和联邦调查局里都有人
Figgis has people in the NYPD and the FBI.

227
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:16,443
祝你们好运
So good luck with that.

228
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:18,612
背叛联邦调查局固然不对
Wow, betraying the FBI is one thing,

229
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:19,980
但你居然会嘲讽 鲍勃
but sarcasm, Bob?

230
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:22,316
好吧 只能靠咱们自己了
All right, we're on our own.

231
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:23,717
我们得把鲍勃从医院带走
We got to get Bob out of this hospital

232
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:24,917
转移到一个安全的地方
and to a secure location,

233
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:27,054
一个纽约警局不知道的地方
someplace the NYPD doesn't know about.

234
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,156
警监 你是成年人了 借我们用下你的湖边小屋
Captain, you're a grown-up; let's just use your lake house.

235
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,459
最后说一次 不是每个成年人都有湖边小屋
For the last time, not all grown-ups have lake houses.

236
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,761
可以去我的公寓
We can go to my apartment.

237
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:34,895
没人知道我住在哪
No one knows where I live.

238
00:07:34,896 --> 00:07:36,263
我以为你请艾米去过一次
I thought you had Amy over there once.

239
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:37,930
没错 玩得很愉快 我第二天就搬走了
Yeah, it was fun. I moved the next day.

240
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,299
就去罗莎家了
Rosa's place it is.

241
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,467
他们知道鲍勃的长相
Well, they know what Bob looks like,

242
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:41,735
但他们从没见过我们
but they've never seen us.

243
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,637
他们只知道我们是一大帮警察
They think we're just a big group of cops.

244
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,806
如果我们看起来不像警察呢
What if we didn't look like cops?

245
00:07:45,807 --> 00:07:47,741
# 我来自纽约 我来自纽约 #
# I'm from New York, I'm from New York #

246
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:49,176
# 我来自来自纽约 #
# I'm from, I'm from New York #

247
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,644
# 我来自纽约 耶 #
# I'm from New York Yeah #

248
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:51,845
# 我来自 #
# I'm from #

249
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,048
很好 大家的扮相都不错
Great, everyone looks fantastic,

250
00:07:54,049 --> 00:07:55,582
我们的帽子看起来也很正常
and our hats look normal.

251
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,552
警长 你真是穿手术服的衣架子
Wow, Sarge, you are just stuffed into those scrubs.

252
00:07:58,553 --> 00:07:59,787
你是怎么做到的
How do you do it?

253
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:01,621
锻炼和控制饮食 没什么难的
Exercise and diet. It's not that hard.

254
00:08:01,656 --> 00:08:02,856
对我来说似乎挺难
Eh, seems pretty hard to me.

255
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,091
我觉得我做不到
I don't think I'm gonna do that.

256
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,492
这勾起了我的回忆
This brings back memories.

257
00:08:05,493 --> 00:08:07,494
我孩童时喜欢玩扮医生的游戏
I loved playing doctor as a child.

258
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:10,297
癌症已经扩散了
The cancer has spread.

259
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:12,132
准备后事吧
Get your house in order.

260
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,600
我们可以这样溜出去
So we can sneak out like this,

261
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:15,069
但是鲍勃怎么办
but what about Bob?

262
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,603
不用担心 我已经处理好了
Not to worry. I've got that covered.

263
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:18,505
希区柯克
Hitchcock.

264
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,875
没错 他被绑着 嘴也堵上了
And, yes, he is bound and gagged under there,

265
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,610
不过更重要的是 你刚才说"鲍勃怎么办"
but more importantly, you said, "What about Bob?"

266
00:08:23,611 --> 00:08:24,678
那是一部电影的名字[天才也疯狂]
That's the name of a movie.

267
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,746
霍尔特引用了流行文化元素
Holt made a pop culture reference.

268
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:26,947
好了 走吧
All right, let's go.

269
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:28,816
好 我们再把下机策略
Okay, let's go over our exit strategy

270
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,084
过一遍
one more time.

271
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,086
2A座的乘客会需要有人帮她取包
Seat 2A is gonna need help with her bags.

272
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,587
她的胳膊细得跟小树枝似的
She has twig arms.

273
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:35,988
要是她挡了我们的道 我就使出怀孕这招来
So if she blocks us, I play the pregnancy card.

274
00:08:36,024 --> 00:08:38,158
记住 扔下行李然后...
And remember, leave our luggage and...

275
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,626
指望在失物招领处能找回来
Roll the dice with lost and found.

276
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,962
我知道 我已经对着你画在呕吐袋上的这张地图
I know; I've been studying this map you drew on the barf bag

277
00:08:41,963 --> 00:08:43,296
研究了四十分钟
for 40 minutes.

278
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:44,965
对不起 只有工作
Sorry, working is the only thing

279
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:46,333
能让我停止担心同事
keeping me from worrying about the squad

280
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:47,768
和焦虑不已
and completely spiraling.

281
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:48,769
需要热毛巾吗
Hot towels?

282
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,037
说了无数次了 不用
For the billionth time, no!

283
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:51,472
我们不需要你那煮过的烂布头
We don't want your boiled rags!

284
00:08:51,473 --> 00:08:54,508
不了 谢谢
No, thank you.

285
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:56,410
似乎你的焦虑并没怎么缓解
I don't know if it's keeping you from spiraling.

286
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,779
我们干嘛不暂时放空一下呢
Look, why don't we just take our mind off everything?

287
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,847
我们在头等舱 可以免费看电影
We're in first class. We get free movies.

288
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:01,915
什么 不要
What? No.

289
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,916
队员们有危险
We can't enjoy ourselves

290
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,118
我们不能在此时享受
while the squad is in danger.

291
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,252
那不公平
That's not fair.

292
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,020
艾米 我们要在这困三个小时
Amy, we're trapped here for three hours.

293
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:09,256
别的事也做不了
There's nothing else we can do.

294
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,258
好吧 那就看一部吧
Fine, I'll watch a movie,

295
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,493
但是不许看我们会喜欢的
but nothing we'll like too much.

296
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:14,061
- 也不许看新上映的 - 当然
- No new releases. - Of course not.

297
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,996
我们就看列表里的第一部好了
We'll just put on whatever's first alphabetically.

298
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:17,930
《27套礼服》
"27 Dresses."

299
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,735
病人脑梗了
His cerebral blood circulation is infarcted.

300
00:09:21,736 --> 00:09:23,470
给我拿根脑室内导管来 快
Get me an ICP catheter, stat!

301
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:24,972
厉害呀 警长
Wow, that was amazing, Sarge.

302
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:26,173
我经常看《实习医生格蕾》
I watch a lot of "Grey's Anatomy."

303
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,774
那个电视剧出奇地真实
That show's surprisingly accurate.

304

305
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:30,510
病人屁股里有颗炸弹
there was a bomb in the guy's butt.

306
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:31,712
那集好看
Oh, that's a good one.

307

他快不行了
He's crashing!

308
00:09:32,747 --> 00:09:34,548
注射十毫升糖皮质激素
Push 10 ccs of corticosteroids,

309
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:37,251
还要准备急诊室做手术减压
plus prep an ER for surgical decompression!

310
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:38,719
我都不知道自己说的是什么
Look, I don't know what any of this means,

311
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
但我觉得自己就像吴珊卓
but I feel like Sandra Oh.

312
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:41,155
医生 需要我准备手术台吗
Doctor, do you need me to start a line?

313
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:42,656
不用了
Oh, we're good.

314
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:44,124
你说他快不行了 给你注射器
You said he's crashing. Here's a syringe.

315
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,393
好嘛 我会用这个刺穿他的皮肤
Oh, good, I'll use this to puncture his skin.

316
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:48,729
有人来了
Uh-oh, we got company.

317
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,531
这人屁股里有个炸弹
Uh, this man has a bomb in his butt!

318
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:51,965
我们得走了
We got to go.

319
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:55,536
银色警报 银色警报
Code silver, code silver.

320
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:56,637
分头走
Split up.

321
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,677
你没事吧
You okay?

322
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:06,613
没事 没事
Yeah, yeah.

323
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:08,916
我只是看得太投入了
I'm just so into the movie,

324
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,851
真担心凯瑟琳・海格尔
you know, really worried about Katherine Heigl

325
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:13,086
和她的制衣事业
and her dressmaking business.

326
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:15,087
不好意思 制衣事业
I'm sorry, dressmaking business?

327
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:16,657
她的建筑师事务所吗
Her architecture firm?

328
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,059
她的蛋糕店
Her cupcake bakery.

329
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,194
她主编的杂志
The magazine she edits?

330
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:23,764
珍是一个热爱户外运动的企业家的
Jane is the executive assistant

331
00:10:23,765 --> 00:10:25,866
行政助理
to an outdoor lifestyle entrepreneur.

332
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,234
你都没在看的
You're not even watching!

333
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,236
对不起 我没法集中注意力
I'm sorry. I can't focus.

334
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,637
我还在焦虑
I'm spiraling.

335
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:31,705
我就知道
Ugh, I knew it.

336
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:33,407
要是连《27套礼服》都不能分散你的注意力
If "27 Dresses" doesn't distract you,

337
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:34,907
那就彻底没辙了 真的
nothing will, nothing will.

338
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:37,711
那现在怎么办
So what do we do?

339
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:39,111
我们就拥抱这焦虑吧
We're gonna embrace the spiral.

340
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:41,548
我们来谈谈这些恐惧
We're gonna talk about these fears.

341
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,550
马上就要来真格的了
Things are about to get real.

342
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,118
- 麻烦你 女士 - 什么事
- Excuse me, ma'am. - Yes?

343
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,453
我们需要一盒纸巾
We're gonna need a box of tissues

344
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:47,855
和舒适的毯子
and some cozy blankets.

00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,156
- 好的 - 还有一样

Nice. Bedpan to the face.

348
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,567
这是便盆吗
That's what this is?

349
00:11:00,568 --> 00:11:03,403
我手都放进去了
Ugh, I put my hands in it.

350
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:07,608
到处都是菲吉斯的人
Figgis' men are everywhere,

351
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:09,009
现在医院各个出口
and now there's hospital security

352
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,010
也都布满了保安
at all the exits.

353
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:11,511
- 我们怎么出去啊 - 别紧张
- How are we gonna escape? - Relax.

354
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:14,414
有一百万种办法可以偷偷溜出医院
There's a million ways to get out of a hospital unnoticed.

355
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:17,217
说一个
Name one.

356
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,719
- 打扮成婴儿 - 什么
- Dress up like babies. - What?

357
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,880
你逼我的
Well, you put me on the spot.

358
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:20,888
你自己提出来的
Well, you brought it up.

359
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,055
好吧 等等 等等
All right, wait, wait, wait.

360
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,290
我真想到了个办法
I've got a real plan.

361
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:27,494
走右边 走右边
Go right! Go right!

362
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,096
杰克 杰克 杰克 杰克
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

363
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:31,064
扔下病床 把病床扔了
Abandon gurney! Abandon gurney!

364
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,368
该死
Damn it!

365
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:36,870
不是鲍勃
It's not Bob.

366
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:38,505
银色警报 不能让你们出去
Code silver. Can't let you out.

367
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:40,774
听着 你得帮帮我 我是个FBI探员
Look, you have to help me. I'm an FBI agent.

368
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,409
我是小威廉姆斯
I am Serena Williams.

369
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,911
抱歉 他们都有
I'm sorry. They both suffer from

370
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,212
严重的妄想症
grandiose delusional disorder.

371
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,380
简称GDD
GDD.

372
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:47,881
我被抓起来做人质了
I've been taken hostage here.

373
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:49,950
我本来应该在温布尔登的
And I'm supposed to be at Wimbledon.

374
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:51,284
到我发球了
It's my serve!

375
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,353
不不不 我没发疯
No, no, no, I am not crazy.

376
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:54,888
他疯了 还疯得很厉害
Yes, he is, deeply.

377
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:57,457
我们要把他们转到一所戒备森严的精神病院
We need to transfer them both to a secure psychiatric facility.

378
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,358
这位小威廉姆斯刚咬掉了一个医生的鼻子
Serena here just bit off a doctor's nose.

379
00:11:59,394 --> 00:12:01,360
美味得很
It tasted delicious.

380
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:02,963
行 你们走吧
Yeah, you can go.

381
00:12:02,964 --> 00:12:04,765
不不 通知联邦调查局
No, no, call the FBI.

382
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,173
不 通知大威廉姆斯 通知大威
No, call Venus! Call Venus!

383
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:11,136
坐下 鲍勃
Have a seat, Bob.

384
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,205
哇 罗莎
Wow, Rosa.

385
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,505
这是你住的地方
This is how you live?

386
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,540
你以为呢
What were you expecting?

387
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:16,942
不知道 石头墙
I don't know, rock walls,

388
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:19,011
武器遍地 用水瀑当门
weapons everywhere, a waterfall for a door...

389
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:20,678
我好像说的是蝙蝠侠的秘密洞穴
I guess I was just picturing the Batcave.

390
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:22,247
你要一个装满柠檬的花瓶做什么
Why do you need a vase full of lemons?

391
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:23,548
房间需要一点亮色
The room needed a pop of color.

392
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,717
你到底是谁
Who are you?

393
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:25,951
行了 鲍勃
All right, Bob,

394
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:27,452
现在该告诉我们档案放哪了
it's time to tell us where that file is.

395
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:28,887
我干嘛要说
And why would I do that?

396
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:30,856
因为我们是你脱身的唯一机会
Because we are your only chance of getting out of this.

397
00:12:30,857 --> 00:12:32,625
你有大量关于菲吉斯的证据
You have tons of evidence on Figgis,

398
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,126
也就是说他很可能会追杀你
which means he's probably gonna kill you.

399
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,762
如果你指证他 我们可以将你纳入证人保护计划
If you turn on him, we can get you into witness protection.

400
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:39,098
你会在佛罗里达某处得到一间不错的小屋子
You'll get a nice, little house somewhere in Florida.

401
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:40,699
我想你会喜欢佛罗里达的 鲍勃
I think you'd love Florida, Bob.

402
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,901
其实我没去过 不过皮普保罗的音乐录影带
I've never actually been there, but Pitbull's videos

403
00:12:42,902 --> 00:12:45,004
让那里看起来十分性感
make it seem muy caliente.

404
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:47,773
我了解菲吉斯 你们比我危险多了
I know Figgis, and you're in far more danger than I.

405
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:48,974
他会来找你们的
He's coming for you.

406
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,310
而且我保证他的手下一定能找到这里
And I guarantee his soldiers find this place.

407
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:52,244
不可能
Not gonna happen.

408
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,879
我通过一间空壳公司租下来的
I rent it out under a shell corporation.

409
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:54,381
是啊
Yeah.

410
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,148
我的邮件都寄到皇后区的一个邮政信箱
My mail goes to a P.O. Box in Queens.

411
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:56,607
就是
Yeah.

412
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:58,517
我的邻居都以为我叫艾米莉・戈德芬奇
My neighbors think my name is Emily Goldfinch.

413
00:12:58,518 --> 00:12:59,031
棒棒哒
Oh, yeah.

414
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:01,086
我的同事都以为我叫罗莎・迪亚兹
People I work with all think my name is Rosa Diaz.

415
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,755
- 对... 等下 什么 - 别操心这个了
- Yeah... wait, what? - Don't worry about it.

416
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:03,989
- 好吧 - 够了
- Okay. - Enough.

417
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,791
我会让这个混球开口的
I'm gonna get this punk to talk.

418
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:07,760
鲍勃
Oh, Bob,

419
00:13:07,761 --> 00:13:11,429
有你好看的了
you are S'ed in the B.

420
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:12,798
我不能失去霍尔特
I can't lose Holt.

421
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,033
我压根还没得到
I've barely scratched the surface

422
00:13:14,034 --> 00:13:16,769
他对我足够的肯定
of the amount of approval I need from him.

423
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,769
我可以吃你的樱桃吗
Can I have your cherry?

424
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:20,439
来吧 妹子
Oh, get in there, girl.

425
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,741
还有杰克... 我已经好几个星期没见着他了
And Jake... I haven't seen him in weeks,

426
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,843
真难熬
and it's been so hard.

427
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:26,712
我非常爱他
I love him so much.

428
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,013
天哪
Oh, my God.

429
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:29,982
我以前跟他说过"我爱你"
I've said "I love you" to him before,

430
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,850
但还从来没加过"非常"二字
but I've never added "So much."

431
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:33,918
要是我再也没机会说"非常"怎么办
What if I never get to say "So much"?

432
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:35,020
那我呢
What about me?

433
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:36,021
要是杰克有个三长两短
What if something happens to Jake,

434
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,256
他就见不到我的孩子了
and he never gets to meet my baby?

435
00:13:37,257 --> 00:13:38,590
我可不想养个
I don't want to hang out with some stupid baby

436
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:39,925
从没见过杰克的傻孩子
who's never met Jake.

437
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:42,494
麻烦你 再来两个圣代
Excuse me. Two more sundaes.

438
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:44,296
我们已经开始降落了
Oh, we've already begun our descent,

439
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:46,098
所以已经停止供应食物了
so we've suspended our food services.

440
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:47,933
不好意思 我们尚在经济舱
Oh, I'm sorry. Are we still in coach?

441
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:50,301
还是在可以为所欲为的头等舱
Or are we in first class where the rules don't apply?

442
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:52,171
查尔斯 没事
Charles, it's okay.

443
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,405
咱们快着陆了
We're about to land.

444
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:54,639
你已经让我不再焦虑了
You got me through the spiral.

445
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:56,441
天哪 你说得对 我们做到了
Oh, my God, you're right. We did it.

446
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:58,443
很抱歉我们对你大声了
I am so sorry we yelled at you.

447
00:13:58,478 --> 00:14:00,346
但我们还是要打包带走圣代
But we will take those sundaes to go.

448
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:01,980
我不管你们有没有盖子
And I don't care if you don't have a lid.

449
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,748
想办法搞个盖子
Y'all make a lid.

450
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,050
好了 开始了
All right, here we go.

451
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,119
警监要开始对他下狠招了
Captain's about to lay into him.

452
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,753
你得告诉我档案在哪里
You need to tell me where the file is.

453
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:10,355
抱歉 雷 我选择不说
I'm sorry, Ray. I'd rather not.

454
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,057
好吧 不是我要的那种彪悍的开场
Okay, not the dynamic start I wanted,

455
00:14:12,058 --> 00:14:13,658
但我确定他只是在热身
but I'm sure he's just getting warmed up.

456
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,992
我可不想再问你一次
I'd prefer not to ask you again.

457
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,262
你听起来好绝望
You sound desperate.

458
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:18,464
我激怒你了[钻到了你的皮肤下面]
I'm under your skin.

459
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:19,765
在我皮肤下面的只有
The only things under my skin

460
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,166
皮脂腺 毛囊
are oil glands, hair bulbs,

461
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,334
神经纤维 血管
nerve fibers, blood vessels,

462
00:14:22,335 --> 00:14:23,435
和一丁点脂肪组织
and a bit of fatty tissue.

463
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:25,304
你忘了还有鲁菲尼小体
You forgot about Ruffini's corpuscle.

464
00:14:25,305 --> 00:14:27,806
天哪 你已经惊慌失措了
Oh, my God, you're rattled.

465
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,507
将军哦
Checkmate.

466
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:31,576
我觉得他的吐槽没有自己想象的那么厉害
I don't think that was as vicious a burn as he thinks.

467
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:32,811
你赢了 没辙了
You beat me. It's over.

468
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:34,979
我已经威风扫地了
I've lost all authority.

469
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:38,082
下一个是谁
Who's next?

470
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,318
好吧 鲍勃
All right, Bob.

471
00:14:39,319 --> 00:14:41,787
你想来硬的吗 很好
You want to play hardball? Good.

472
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:44,155
江湖传言说你喜欢爵士乐
Word on the street is, you like jazz.

473
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,125
何止喜欢
I don't just like jazz;

474
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:47,625
是情有独钟
I'm fond of it.

475
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,095
我不明白有什么区别
I don't understand the difference.

476
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:52,064
立刻告诉我档案藏哪儿了
Tell me where the file is right now,

477
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,298
否则我就彻底毁了你的爵士乐
or I will ruin jazz for you forever.

478
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:55,967
我倒想想瞧瞧你的本事
I'd like to see you try.

479
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:58,871
你做了个错误的决定 老伯
Wrong choice, daddy-o.

480
00:15:06,846 --> 00:15:08,580
你打算怎么跟你的孩子说呢 兄弟
What are you gonna tell your kids, man?

481
00:15:08,581 --> 00:15:10,681
说他们的爸爸是个骗子吗
That their daddy's a crook?

482
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:13,051
我没有孩子
I don't have any kids.

483
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:16,488
我的说词全都是基于你有孩子准备的
My whole thing was based on you having kids!

484
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:20,426
现在全都变成假设性的了
Now all of this is gonna be hypothetical.

485
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,498
不许用工具 迪亚兹
No tools, Diaz.

486
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:29,268
行吧 先生 我要讲五个故事
All right, mister, here are five stories

487
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:32,637
是关于我的表姐莉安和她所谓的莱姆病的
about my cousin Lee-Ann and her alleged Lyme disease.

488
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,071
这怎么可能套出我的话来呢
How's that gonna make me talk?

489
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,141
不是全世界都围着你转 鲍勃
Not everything's about you, Bob.

490
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,743
我只是要发泄一下
I just needed to vent.

491
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:39,210
天哪 你真是跟莉安如出一辙
God, you're such a Lee-Ann.

492
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,113
好了 听着 伙计
All right, listen up, buddy.

493
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:42,281
你要告诉我们东西在哪
You're gonna tell us where it is.

494
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:43,582
以及是什么东西
And also what it is.

495
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,250
我们对在找什么东西还有点懵
We're a little unclear what we're after.

496
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,257
不许用剑
No swords.

497
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:54,927
她会仰头看着你
So she's gonna look up at you,

498
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,695
在她假设的双眼中
with hypothetical tears

499
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,763
含着假设的泪水
in her hypothetical eyes,

500
00:15:58,798 --> 00:16:02,768
问你为何别人假设的老爸
and ask why all the other hypothetical daddies

501
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,671
在职业体验日那天都来了
came in for career day.

502
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,438
我不行了 不能再说了
I can't. I can't.

503
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:09,208
就是说 "也许你总感到疲倦
So it's like, "Yeah, maybe you're tired all the time

504
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,609
是因为你得病了 莉安
"Because you're sick, Lee-Ann,

505
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,945
也可能只是因为你住在里诺你才抑郁"
or maybe you're depressed because you live in Reno."

506
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:19,718
怎么回事
What just happened?

507
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:20,986
有人切断了电源
Somebody cut the power.

508
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:24,179
时间到 看起来菲吉斯已经找到了你们
Time's up. Looks like Figgis found you.

509
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:27,414
好了 门挡好了
Okay, door's secure.

510
00:16:27,415 --> 00:16:28,765
那是最后一根蜡烛了
That's the last of the candles.

511
00:16:28,783 --> 00:16:30,885
那是多芯蜡烛吗
Is that multi-wick?

512
00:16:30,885 --> 00:16:32,852
我闻到的是罗勒和柑橘的味道吗
Am I smelling basil and tangerine?

513
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:34,288
这一款叫"夏日之吻"
It's called "Summer's Kiss."

514
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:35,855
你到底是个什么人
What the hell is going on with you?

515
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,724
我不想触你们痛处 警探们
I hate to rub it in, detectives,

516
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,926
但我早就说过他们会找到我的
but I told you they'd find me.

517
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,394
狙击手 都趴下
Sniper! Everybody down!

518
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:44,765
- 瞄错人了 瞄错人了 - 鲍勃
- Wrong guy! Wrong guy! - Bob!

519
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:47,301
离窗户远点
Stay away from the windows!

520
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:48,602
警监 桌子
Captain, table!

521
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:54,508
天哪 怎么回事
Oh, my God. What's going on?

522
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:55,508
他们想杀我
They tried to kill me.

523
00:16:57,345 --> 00:16:58,445
我们得离开这里
We have to get out of here,

524
00:16:58,446 --> 00:16:59,513
我们得马上离开这里
and we have to get out of here now.

525
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:00,914
没问题 我有间避难室
It's cool. I have a panic room.

526
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:02,950
太好了 这才是我认识的罗莎
Yes! There's the Rosa I know.

527
00:17:02,951 --> 00:17:04,183
"夏日之吻"见鬼去吧
"Summer's Kiss" my ass.

528
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:05,486
但装不下我们所有人
But it won't fit all of us.

529
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:07,054
看来只有把不乖的鲍勃留在外面了
Well, looks like Bob's the odd man out.

530
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:08,389
- 再见 鲍勃 - 不不不不不
- Bye, Bob. - No, no, no, no, no, no.

531
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,990
你们必须带上我 他们会杀了我的
You have to take me with you. They'll kill me.

532
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:11,491
听着 我会交代的
Look, I'll talk.

533
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:13,192
档案放在一个保险箱里
The file is in a safe deposit box.

534
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:15,328
钥匙在我的车尾箱内衬里
The keys are in my car in the lining of my trunk.

535
00:17:15,363 --> 00:17:16,363
好吧 那行
All right, fine.

536
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:17,964
你们带鲍勃去避难室
Take Bob with you into the panic room.

537
00:17:17,999 --> 00:17:19,232
罗莎和我另想办法出去
Rosa and I'll find another way out.

538
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:20,266
我相信你可以的 孩子
I'm sure you will, son.

539
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:21,568
你叫我"孩子"
You called me "son."

540
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,605
不许收回啦
No take-backs.

541
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:25,839
我什么时候才能开门
How will I know to open the door?

542
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,541
听到我敲出《性感冷艳麦迪娜》的节奏再开
When you hear me knock the "Funky Cold Medina."

543
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,376
我不知道《性感冷艳麦迪娜》是什么鬼
I don't know what the "Funky Cold Medina" is.

544
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:31,045
就算结合上下文也猜不出来
Even context clues have failed me.

545
00:17:31,046 --> 00:17:33,280
好啦 你会知道是我的
All right, you'll know it's me.

546
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:37,084
你为什么要这么做 鲍勃
Why'd you do it, Bob?

547
00:17:37,085 --> 00:17:39,218
为什么要背叛你曾经守护的一切
Why'd you betray everything you ever stood for?

548
00:17:39,254 --> 00:17:42,222
我花了十四年打掉一个墨西哥贩毒团伙
I spent 14 years bringing down a Mexican cartel.

549
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:44,558
你知道他们回报我什么吗
You know what they gave me for it?

550
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,344
一封嘉奖信 还把我的姓写错了
A letter of commendation with my last name misspelled.

551
00:17:47,362 --> 00:17:48,395
说句公道话 鲍勃
In all fairness, Bob,

552
00:17:48,396 --> 00:17:50,097
谁会把"安德森"写成"安德木"呀
who spells "Anderson" with three Ns?

553
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:52,266
不管了 我想既然他们不打算尊重我
Regardless, I figured if they're not gonna give me

554
00:17:52,267 --> 00:17:54,233
我还不如搞点钱
any respect, I might as well get paid.

555
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,269
值得吗
Was it worth it?

556
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,870
当然 我赚了上百万
Of course. I made millions.

557
00:17:56,871 --> 00:17:58,038
我周游过世界
I traveled the world.

558
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:59,172
吃过鲸鱼
I've eaten whale.

559
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,008
我觉得鲸鱼肉会很肥腻
I always assumed whale would be too fatty.

560
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,443
我不用觉得
Well, I don't have to assume.

561
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:04,077
我很清楚就是这样
I know for a fact it is.

562
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:05,746
太恶心了
It's disgusting.

563
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:07,114
我都吐了
I threw up.

564
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:10,584
这么有节奏
That sounds funky.

565
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:12,318
肯定是杰克
Must be Jake.

566
00:18:15,757 --> 00:18:16,789
怎么回事
What's going on?

567
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:19,759
哈哈 我们骗到你了 笨蛋
Ha-ha, we fooled you, you fool!

568
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:21,295
我本来想说些更酷的台词
I was gonna do something cooler,

569
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:22,863
但转念又想 "就凭感觉来吧"
but then I was just like, "Go with what you feel."

570
00:18:22,864 --> 00:18:24,063
这都是谁
Who are these people?

571
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:25,866
这是我最好的朋友 查尔斯
Oh, well, this is my best friend, Charles,

572
00:18:25,867 --> 00:18:27,101
这是我女朋友 艾米
and this is my girlfriend, Amy.

573
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:28,602
她其实并没怀孕
She's not really pregnant.

574
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:30,437
我们想慢慢来 但是感觉很好
We're taking things slow, but it's going really good.

575
00:18:30,438 --> 00:18:31,605
- 杰克 - 对
- Jake? - Right.

576
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,223
他们大约一小时前到了这里
They arrived about an hour ago.

577
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,142
先生 我需要你给四一零号
Sir, I'm gonna need you to cut the power

578
00:18:35,143 --> 00:18:36,910
罗莎・迪亚兹的房间断电
for Rosa Diaz in apartment 410.

579
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:39,246
- 四一零住的是艾米莉・戈德芬奇 - 谁
- 410 is Emily Goldfinch. - Who?

580
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,248
黑色卷发 特别爱笑
Curly black hair, always smiling,

581
00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:42,815
就是感觉话有点多
a little chatty for my taste.

582
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:45,419
我有好多问题想问 但是没时间了
I have so many questions, but there's no time.

583
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,287
切断电源
Cut the power.

584
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:49,123
狙击手是查尔斯扮的
The sniper was Charles...

585
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:50,224
砰
Bang.

586
00:18:50,225 --> 00:18:52,225
还有罗莎
And Rosa.

587
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,461
当你藏在避难室的时候
And while you were cowering in the panic room,

588
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:55,929
我去拿来了这份文件
I went and got this file

589
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,131
以免你说谎
to make sure you weren't lying.

590
00:18:57,132 --> 00:18:58,332
那这是怎么回事
Well, what happened in here?

591
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,566
像是发生过一场打斗
It looks like there was a fight.

592
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:00,567
我弄的
Oh, it was me.

593
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:04,271
你们踏进房间的那一刻起 我就决定
I was done with this place the minute you all

594
00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:05,271
抛弃这里了
stepped foot in it.

595
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:06,607
哎呀
Oops.

596
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:08,108
你真该接受我们的证人保护计划方案
Guess you should have taken our witness protection offer

597
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:09,308
去佛罗里达的 鲍勃
and gone to Florida, Bob.

598
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:10,644
我们现在有充足的证据
We have more than enough evidence

599
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:12,112
可以扳倒你和菲吉斯了
to take you and Figgis down.

600
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:13,547
你中计了 鲍勃
You've been played, Bob.

601
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:14,915
这都是策略
It was all a ruse.

602
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,818
跟杰克・佩拉尔塔共事过三年的人
You don't work with Jake Peralta for three years

603
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:20,788
怎么可能不知道"性感冷艳麦迪娜"
without knowing what the "Funky Cold Medina" Is.

604

"我问这哥们 '怎么这么爽'"

Funky Cold Medina.

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:30,396
没排练过哦
Zero rehearsal.

609

我刚跟司法部通过电话

611
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:38,405
他的组织已经垮了
His operation is decimated.

612
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:40,790
他们抓到菲吉斯了吗
Did they find Figgis?

还没有 但是他们相信会的
Not yet, but they're confident they will.

等他们抓到他 皮门托警探就可以回来了
And when they do, Detective Pimento can come home.

等不及了
Can't wait.

你们真是太可爱了
You guys are so cute.

618
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:51,217
我提议大家干一杯
I'd like to propose a toast.

619
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:53,487
即使是鲍勃用枪指着我的脑袋时
Even when Bob held that gun to my head,

620
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:54,721
我也毫无畏惧
I was not afraid,

621
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:57,590
因为我知道你们会追查到底
because I knew you were on the case.

622
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:01,428
我要向在座的所有人表达我由衷的敬意
I respect the hell out of each and every one of you.

624
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,667
最喜欢听大家一起这么喊
Love it when everyone chants that.

625
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:11,071
查尔斯和我在飞机上的时候想了很多事
So Charles and I really got into it on the plane,

626
00:20:11,072 --> 00:20:13,740
在吃到第五个圣代时 我突然想到
and around sundae number five, I realized

627
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,074
我们应该搬到一起住
we should move in together.

628
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,442
你和查尔斯
You and Charles?

629
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:17,743
不是 我们俩
No, you and me.

630
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:19,012
噢
Oh!

631
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:20,747
对 这样才合情合理
Yes, that makes so much more sense.

我非常爱这个画面
I love this so much.

636
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,893
看来查尔斯一直在偷听我们说话
So I guess Charles was listening to our conversation.

637
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,027
是啊
Yeah.

638
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:37,297
我得接一下
Ooh, I'm gonna get this.

639

你和雷・霍尔特搞垮了我的生意
You and Ray Holt took down my operation.

643
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:50,811
我要杀了你们
Now I'm gonna kill you both.

644
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:52,679
回见 哥们
Later, dog.

645
00:20:57,152 --> 00:20:59,054
霍尔特警监
Uh, Captain Holt?

646
00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:04,191
{\an7\fs20}# 天空对我展舒颜 #
Blue skies smiling at me

Nothing but bluebirds

All day long
