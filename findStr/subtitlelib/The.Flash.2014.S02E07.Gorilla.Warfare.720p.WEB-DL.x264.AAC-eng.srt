00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:03,001
<i>- My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,605
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:09,641
<i>To the outside world, I'm</i>
<i>an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,644
<i>but secretly, with the help of</i>
<i>my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:16,248
<i>I fight crime and find</i>
<i>other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,283
<i>I hunted down the man</i>
<i>who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:21,620
<i>but in doing so, I opened up</i>
<i>our world to new threats,</i>

8
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:24,790
<i>and I am the only one</i>
<i>fast enough to stop them.</i>

9
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,726
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,361
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

11
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,896
Zoom wants me dead.

12
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,664
The meta-humans that he's
sending from Earth-2,

13
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,032
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,567
- I have to go.

15
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,869
I need you to tell me
that it's okay.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,438
- Ah!
- Barry.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,509
- Is this the face of your hero,
Central City?

18
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,613
- Ah!
- Ah!

19
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,382
- Seriously got your ass kicked.

20
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,950
- I can't feel my legs.

21
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,493
- All right, I got you.

22
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,628
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

23
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,803
- I can't do it right now,
all right?

24
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,440
- Oh, yes you can, Barry.
- No, no, no.

25
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,875
- We've been making
so much progress.

26
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:17,943
- Yep, six whole steps.

27
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,544
Someone get me a Bozo button.

28
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:20,912
- Hey, give yourself
some credit.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,647
You just broke your back.

30
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,049
- Yeah, a normal person
would've been paralyzed

31
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,617
the rest of his life.

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,819
- How long until I'm
fully healed?

33
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,554
- The initial MRI
I took a week ago

34
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:33,325
showed a complete dislocation at
the T12-L1 interspace

35
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,460
of the thoracolumbar junction.

36
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,996
But this is the MRI
I took this morning.

37
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:40,799
It's remarkable, but you're
almost completely healed.

38
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,467
- I'm still having trouble
breathing.

39
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,903
- That's totally normal
with a spinal injury.

40
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,439
It should clear up soon.

41
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,076
- We're going to get you back
in that suit, Barry.

42
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:53,945
Real quick, trust me.

43
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,415
- What are we gonna do
about Zoom?

44
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:59,117
- No sign of him since Cisco
nailed him with that tranq dart.

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,019
- And I haven't vibed
since then.

46
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:05,490
- Maybe Zoom's not coming back.
- I highly doubt that.

47
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,426
Which is why I'm gonna go do
something about it.

48
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,494
- What do you mean, go do
something about it?

49
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,764
- I need access to your breach
room and your speed cannon.

50
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,399
- Why is that?

51
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,602
- Because, Barry,
it's time to go home.

52
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:27,379
- So, you show up on our Earth,
you screw everything up,

53
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,847
and now you want to go home?

54
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,682
Sounds very familiar.

55
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:33,819
- Again, that wasn't me.

56
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,988
I need to go take care of Zoom
once and for all

57
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,523
before anyone else gets killed.

58
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,724
- How do you plan on doing that?

59
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,426
- I'll think of something.

60
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:42,961
Ramon, if you'll escort me
to the speed cannon.

61
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,396
- No, no, you can't go
through the breach.

62
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,597
- Yeah, he can.

63
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,631
Jay taught us how to
send people.

64
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,966
- That's not what I mean.

65
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,701
Look, if you can figure out
how to stop Zoom

66
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,137
on your Earth, you can
figure out how to do it here.

67
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,508
We need you to stay here until
we defeat Zoom, Dr. Wells.

68
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,645
- What I need, Dr. Snow,
is to return home.

69
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,716
And I'm going to that with
or without your assistance.

70
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,622
- What are you doing?
If Harry wants to go...bye.

71
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,991
- Look, like it or not, Cisco,
we need his help.

72
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,994
- I'm not sure another plan
from Wells is what we need.

73
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,796
- Yeah, I mean,
the last bright idea he had

74
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:18,930
nearly got Barry killed.

75
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,832
- No, I know, but Jay's gone,

76
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:23,101
and Dr. Wells knows Zoom
better than anyone,

77
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:26,805
so until Barry is back
on his feet again,

78
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,708
we need to keep Wells around
in case Zoom returns.

79
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,943
- Caitlin, if he doesn't
want to be here,

80
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,011
then we're better off
without him.

81
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,145
Let him go.

82
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,982
- I can't do that.
Not yet.

<i>[alarm blares]</i>

84
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,987
- Oh, snap, meta-human attack.

85
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:47,192
Nope, nope, my bad, that is
just an alert for me.

86
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:50,095
- For what?
- Oh, it's just a reminder.

87
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,597
I have a date in an hour, so...

88
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,599
- Oh, with who?

89
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,735
- With the lovely
Kendra Saunders,

90
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,169
the barista at Jitters.

91
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,005
Oh, she makes a mean latte.

92
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:02,073
I think we're gonna go out
for dinner and a movie,

93
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,109
and then, I don't know,
maybe some breakfast.

94
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,578
- [laughs]
- Wait, breakfast?

95
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,979
Why breakfast?
I don't...

96
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,816
- Yeah...

97
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,553
- 'Cause, you know,
you go home...

98
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:15,787
- Cisco.
- And...

99
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,022
- He's messing with you.
- Go.

100
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,257
- Oh.

00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,327

Patty, hey.
- Hey. I hear you're still sick.

104
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:40,045
- Yeah, yeah,
it's a...nasty bug.

105
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:42,714
- Well, I make a mean chicken
noodle soup from scratch.

106
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,749
I could bring some by later
if you'd like.

107
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,052
- No, that's sweet, I just--
I'd feel terrible

108
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,520
if you caught any of this.

109
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,156
Besides, I love
the canned stuff.

110
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:53,692
- Okay, well, try to stay
off your feet.

111
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:57,762
- Oh, yeah, believe me, I am.

112
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,965
- You sure you're okay?

113
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,067
You sound like something's up.

114
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,868
- Yeah, no, no, no, no.
I'm fine.

115
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,838
I'm just not myself right now.

116
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,107
- Okay, well,
I hope to see you soon,

117
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,809
and, uh, feel better.

118
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:13,044
- Thanks.
- Bye.

119
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,113
- Bye.

120
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,125
- You should stay away
from the cheese curds.

121
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,293
They're addicting.

00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,661
- [chuckles]

123
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,196
I'm going to take a wild stab

124
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,631
and guess that you're here
without the consent

125
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,866
of the rest of
your fabulous team.

126
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,035
- It's been difficult,
having you here.

127
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,737
For all of us.

128
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:40,071
- You don't have to worry
about that anymore

129
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,107
because I'm leaving.

130
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,143
- We can help you
save your daughter.

131
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:49,614
I know that's why
you want to go home.

132
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:54,085
- Look, I made
a big mistake coming here.

133
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:57,956
My plan was to get
the Flash's help

134
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,225
and use that help to stop Zoom,
and my plan failed.

135
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,926
I don't have another plan,

136
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:06,097
except to go back home
and face Zoom myself.

137
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,866
- So let's say you go back
to your Earth,

138
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,601
and you fight Zoom.

139
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,169
He will kill you.

140
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,739
And then, how does that
help your daughter?

141
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,375
Look, the best way
to save Jesse

142
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,246
is for you to stay here,
and work with us as a team.

143
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,015
- No.

144
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,950
Now, please leave me alone,
while I discover

145
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,621
which one of these breaches
is gonna get me home.

146
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,322
- You know, you're lucky
Cisco and Professor Stein

147
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,291
never figured out how to close
all the breaches,

148
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:37,662
'cause then you'd be stuck here.

149
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,932
- Wait.

150
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,235
We close the breaches.

151
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,837
All of them, except one,

152
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,908
so Zoom only has one way
to get to this world.

153
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,648
- The breach at S.T.A.R. Labs.
- Exactly.

154
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,650
And then we set a trap.

155
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:02,854
- It's got fencing, fighting,
torture, revenge,

156
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:07,425
giants, monsters, chases,
escapes,

157
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:11,229
true love, miracles, and,

158
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:14,666
it's ranked as one of the best
date movies of all time.

159
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,737
- Well, let's see
if that's true.

160
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:28,246
Cisco?

161
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,149
Are you okay?

162
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,017
- I gotta go.

163
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,086
- What? Why?

164
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:39,824
- I am so sorry that
this is happening right now.

165
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,694
I am so, so sorry.

166
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:46,364
Um, I have to go.

167
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:48,767
I'll call you, okay?

168
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:52,036
I'll call you,
I swear.

169
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,172
Mm!

170
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:02,480
- Okay, Brian,
let that sit overnight,

171
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,049
and then we'll assay
in the morning.

172
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:12,891
- Dr. Shore?

173

00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,883
from the particle accelerator
explosion?

351
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,886
That's how this happened.

352
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,023
<i>- Repeat.</i>

353
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,524
- Repeat?

354
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,561
- [snarls]

355
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:50,434
<i>Need to repeat Grodd.</i>

356
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,772
- You want me to make
more like you?

357
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:58,409
I don't know how to do that.

358
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,479
<i>- Learn.</i>

359
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,995
- [heavy breathing]

360
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,767
- Keep that chin down, slugger.

361
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,735
- Dad.

362
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,041
- Yeah.

363
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:44,588
- That was a hell of an idea
you had, bringing Henry here.

364
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,990
- Well, he may not
have his mother,

365
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,426
but he's got two
amazing fathers.

366
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:49,593
Seemed like he needed both.

367
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,630
- Hmm.

368
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,132
Good girl.
- Mm.

369
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,670
- So how did Grodd
become sentient?

370
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,806
- A few years ago, S.T.A.R. Labs
had this contract

371
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,841
with the military
to research and awaken

372
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:07,645
latent mind-reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

373
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,980
- And I'm guessing Grodd is
one of the test subjects?

374
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,016
- Right, but then Dr. Wells
shut down the program,

375
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,818
and we all thought
it was to save Grodd

376
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,455
from all the crazy
mind-control experiments,

377
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,857
but it was really so that
Dr. Wells could use

378
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,158
the accelerator explosion
to create

379
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,093
a 1,500-pound
mind-controlling gorilla

380
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,830
that he could manipulate.

381
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
What kind of
algorithm is that?

382
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,869
- It's an algorithm meant to
extrapolate Grodd's location

383
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:35,239
from places we know
he's already been.

384
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:41,045
Hello.

385
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,746
There we have it.

386
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,782
- No spinal cord edema.

387
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:46,684
I don't see any
subacute hemorrhaging.

388
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:51,188
Bone fused beautifully.
You're all good, Barry.

389
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,690
I'd give you
some physical therapy,

390
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,427
but you don't need it.

391
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,661
- I'm really glad
you're here, Dad.

392
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,497
- Me too.

393
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,565
You know, I tried to call,
but you can't a cell

394
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,634
in Granite Peak National Park,
so...

395
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:04,902
- Granite Peak--
what are you--

396
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,704
You went camping by yourself?

397
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,740
- Yeah, yeah, I got a tent.
I went fishing every day.

398
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:13,143
I have had my fill of
largemouth bass for a while.

399
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:14,745
[both chuckle]

400
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:20,851
Sometimes you just have
to slow down

401
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,622
to get back to where
you want to be.

402
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:27,892
- Yeah. Look, Dad--
- Hey, guys.

403
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,727
I think we've found them.

404
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,195
- Yeah?

405
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:34,031
- Grodd has to be in one of
these three bell towers.

406
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,633
The only reason
we couldn't find him

407
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,501
on any cameras underneath
the city before is

408
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,003
'cause he upgraded from
a bachelor pad

409
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:41,005
to a penthouse,
like a baller.

410
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,506
- Okay, so we know where he is.

411
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:43,908
We still don't know
how to get her.

412
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,843
- We got a plan for you.
- What's the plan?

413
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,645
- We use me.

414
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:50,514
- [grunts]

415
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:51,982
- That's Harry!
That's the other Wells!

416
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:53,751
- Barry.
- Let him go.

417
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,554
Let him go.

418
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:57,855
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,590
- We found another suit
in the Time Vault.

420
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,058
- I thought he was dead.
- He's dead.

421
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,894
This is--this is Harrison Wells
from Earth-2.

422
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,663
- Earth-2?
- I'll explain later.

423
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,197
- If we can get Harry
to convince Grodd

424
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,633
that he's Wells,
that he's his father,

425
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,803
maybe we can convince him
to let Caitlin go.

426
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,943
- I'm not gonna be able to help
if anything goes wrong.

427
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,012
- That's a chance
I'm willing to take.

428
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,286
- Looks like we're 0-for-2 on
the bell towers, huh?

429
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,921
- I like to think of it more as,

430
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,223
now we know exactly
where they are.

431
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,892
- Okay, let's do this again.
Gimme your best Wells.

432
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,226
- I'm not doing the Wells
again, Ramon.

433
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,861
I told you--
- Look.

434
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,197
I just made these
anti-mind-control ear buds.

435
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,666
They could fail,
and if they do, you're toast,

436
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,568
so you're gonna need to nail it
if you want to live.

437
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,871
- [sighs]
Ramon.

438
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,742
- Cisco.
- Cisco.

439
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:55,980
In many ways, you've shown me
what it's like to have a son.

440
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,649
What?

441
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,952
- Okay, let's--let's just
try it again.

442
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:05,122
This time, up the creep factor,
like, a lot more,

443
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:08,258
and make it
a little more sincere.

444
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,893
Like you really love me,

445
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,597
but you're gonna have to
kill me anyway.

446
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,734
- Cisco.

447
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,702
In many ways,

448
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:23,674
you've shown me what it's like
to have a son.

449
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:27,044
- Yup, that's the one.
Here you go.

450
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,046
<i>[phone rings]</i>

451
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,848
Yo.

452
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,816
Yeah, we're moving on
to the third location.

453
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,052
- Copy that.

454
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,154
Now we wait.

455
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,189
- So this is what it's like

456
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,092
every time you go after
one of those meta-humans?

457
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,094
- Uh, pretty much.

458
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,130
Only, Cisco and Caitlin are
normally the ones in here

459
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,865
and I'm the one out there.

460
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,367
- Well, there's no reason
you shouldn't be.

461
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,637
Iris showed me what happened.

462
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,173
With Zoom?

463
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:57,975
That was hard to watch.

464
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:01,779
I can only imagine what that
must have been like for you.

465
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:05,382
- He showed everyone
in Central City

466
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:09,386
that their hero wasn't
good enough to stop him.

467
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,122
- Well, that's certainly
what it looked like.

468
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,323
Was he right?

469
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,725
- [scoffs]

470
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:16,193
- Your body's healed, Barry,

471
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:19,396
and yet here you are,

472
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,466
feeling the shame of losing.

473
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,836
- I can't stop him.

474
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:28,372
I know it.
He knows it.

475
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:32,643
And now everyone in this city
knows it too.

476
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,045
They don't believe in me
anymore, Dad.

477
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,780
- At my trial for
your mother's death,

478
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,183
a lot of our family and friends
were in the courtroom.

479
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:43,353
They heard awful things about
what I had done to your mother.

480
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,689
It didn't matter that
it wasn't true.

481
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,324
Every day, I could see it
on their faces,

482
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,827
the moment when I lost them,

483
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:53,430
until everybody had stopped
believing in me.

484
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,299
Well, that was my reality.

485
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,434
You know, I was gonna serve
a life sentence

486
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,137
for a crime I didn't commit,
but worse than that,

487
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,805
every time I looked at someone
in the eye

488
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,140
from that moment forward,
they were gonna believe

489
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:07,311
that I had killed
the woman I loved

490
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:12,883
in front of our son.

491
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:16,120
So yeah, I do know
what it's like

492
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:21,825
being destroyed.

493
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,995
- How did you get past that?

494
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:26,864
- I embraced it.

495
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,102
Accepting it was the only way
that I could move forward,

496
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:36,006
but I know that if
I could survive that,

497
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,975
and learn to believe
in myself again,

498
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:42,079
then I could survive anything.

499
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,915
You know what lit that belief
in me, Barry?

500
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,785
You.

501
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,020
11-year-old you, running around,
believing in me,

502
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:53,190
gave me that hope.

503
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,131
And now I'm giving it
back to you, son.

504
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:05,102
No more monsters can
take that from us.

505
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:14,278
- So, one of the main
differences

506
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,181
between ape and human brains

507
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,250
is the white matter and
connectivity in the brain cells.

508
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,785
- [grunts]

509
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:23,320
- The chemicals that you
were treated with

510
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:26,056
as an infant were meant
to overcome those differences

511
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,092
and cause
an explosive growth of both,

512
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,427
similar to what
humans experience

513
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,996
in their first few years
of life.

514
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,898
Maybe these chemicals
can be used

515
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,034
to duplicate that growth,
and then we won't need

516
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,136
a particle accelerator
explosion.

517
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:42,206
- [growls]

518
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,346
- Hey, buddy.
- [growls]

519
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:53,050
- Easy, buddy.
It's me.

520
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,919
I'm back.

521
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,223
<i>- Father, you died.</i>

522
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,859
- No.

523
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,928
No, buddy, I didn't die.

524
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,264
I just went away for a while.

525
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:11,401
- All right, that's great,
Wells, keep talking.

526
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,973
- But now that I'm back,

527
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:20,444
we don't need Caitlin anymore,
do we, buddy?

528
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:22,112
So you can let her go.

529
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,581
- [growls]

530
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,517
- Come on, buddy.

531
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:32,522
Let me get her out of here.

532
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:35,492
Please.

533
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:40,564
<i>- Father never ask.</i>
<i>Father take.</i>

534
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,099
- Run.

535
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:44,368
- [roars]

536
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,170
<i>Who are you?</i>

537
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,141
- Cisco, you gotta get
in there, man.

538
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,443
- [roars]

539
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,978
- Oh, Cisco, thank God.

540
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,480
- Okay, you guys gotta
get out of there.

541
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,915
- Harry's trapped.
We can't leave him here.

542
00:26:57,917 --> 00:27:00,550
What do we do?

543
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,320
- The drugs.
The drugs that Grodd stole.

544
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,622
Wells--an overdose of those
drugs will shock his brain.

545
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,325
Okay, just hit him with
as much as you can.

546
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:12,029
<i>- You are not him!</i>
<i>You are not Father!</i>

547
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:15,365
- I am father.
- [growls]

548
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:20,137
- And you hit father.

549
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,539
Grodd.

550
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:30,380
Look at me.

551
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,650
Look at me!
- [roars]

552
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:40,390
- I would never
leave you here alone.

553
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:43,727
Grodd, I made you a promise.

554
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:52,069
I have bigger plans for you.
Remember?

555
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:57,174
One day, this city
will be yours.

556
00:27:57,176 --> 00:28:00,477
I promised you.

557
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,246
I intend to honor that promise.

558
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,615
- [growls]

559
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,418
[roars]

560
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,188
- Go!

561
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,257
- [growls]

562
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,996
- Come on.

563
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:32,009
- Thank you.
- Thank you for rescuing me.

564
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:35,445
- Well, we're a team, right?

565
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,648
- I'm impressed.
I think we all are.

566
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:41,184
- Yeah, well, we need to do
something about Grodd.

567
00:28:41,186 --> 00:28:43,954
- Like what?
- Like get rid of him for good.

568
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,555
- You want to kill him?

569
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,557
- Considering how many people
he's killed, yeah.

570
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,292
- This isn't Grodd's fault.

571
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,528
He's only like this
because Wells made him this way.

572
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,164
- Yes, but, Catie, he kidnapped
you and you could have died.

573
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,299
- You didn't see what I saw.

574
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,568
Grodd's getting smarter.

575
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,637
He's lonely and sad.

576
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:02,305
He wants more apes like him.

577
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,107
- What are you saying?
He wants kids?

578
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,143
'Cause I'm pretty sure
one telepathic Grape Ape

579
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,645
is more than enough
for this city.

580
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:10,647
- I know somewhere
we could send him.

581
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,482
- What are you talking about?

582
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,318
- When the singularity exploded
and I discovered the breach

583
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,488
in S.T.A.R. Labs,
I ran similar tests

584
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,426
and discovered the same thing,
51 additional breaches.

585
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,628
The difference being
the breaches in Central City

586
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,329
are scattered
all throughout the city

587
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,199
whereas counterparts in my world
most definitely are not.

588
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:30,700
- And you know where they lead?

589
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:33,603
- Well, I was in the process
of figuring all that out

590
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,239
when Dr. Snow so gallantly
convinced me to stay,

591
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:40,010
but if I am correct,
this breach is gonna get Grodd

592
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,345
as close to home as he's ever
likely to get.

593
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,449
- Okay, even if you're right,

594
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:49,119
how do we bait Grodd
to go through it?

595
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,655
- My son'll do it.

596
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:54,157
Won't you, Flash?

597
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:05,735
- Grodd?

598
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,840
<i>- Caitlin.</i>

599
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,250
<i>Flash.</i>

600
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,685
- You want Caitlin, Grodd,

601
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:26,156
you're gonna have to
catch me first.

602
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,825
- [growls]

603
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,675
- So Barry's gonna lure Grodd
in front of the breach?

604
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,644
- Yep, and once he gets him
to the right spot,

605
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:50,480
Cisco's gonna blast him into
Earth-2 with his thingamajig.

606
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:52,849
- [laughs] Speed cannon.
- Exactly.

607
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,752
- Well, things have gotten
a lot more complicated

608
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,487
since I got out of prison.

609
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:59,789
- Mm-hmm.
- Man, you have no idea.

610
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,292
- Cisco, almost there.
Are you ready?

611
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:03,727
- I'm in position.

612
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:05,862
- Now, once you turn on
the speed cannon,

613
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,597
the quark matter will stabilize,

614
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,199
stretching the breach
about so big,

615
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:13,203
so anywhere within this circle
will suffice.

616
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,281
Right on time.

617
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,849
- Okay, come on.

618
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:30,487
I don't have eyes on Grodd.
Does anyone see him?

619
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,489
- [roars]

620
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,193
- That is a big gorilla.

621
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:39,529
<i>- Where is Caitlin?</i>

622
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,867
- [chokes]
Ah!

623
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,368
- [roars]

624
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,803
- Oh, my God.
- Get up, Barry.

625
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,773
- Ah!
- [growls]

626
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:52,709
<i>Where is Caitlin, Flash?</i>

627
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,211
- [grunts]

628
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,412
- Right here.

629
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,514
- No.
No, no, no.

630
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,549
- You need to let him go, Grodd.

631
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,818
<i>- Flash is my enemy.</i>

632
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,555
<i>Now you, too.</i>
- No.

633
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,758
He was trying to save me
from you.

634
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,427
We didn't understand
what you wanted,

635
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,562
but now we do.

636
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:19,202
I can give you what you want.
I can give you a home.

637
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:22,005
You just have to trust me.

638
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,178
- [gasping and coughing]

639
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,313
- All right, here he comes.

640
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,786
- [grunts]

641
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,890
- Ready to flip the switch.

642
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:42,926
Now, Barry.

643
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,337
- [roars]

644
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:57,307
- Full power.
- It is.

645
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,377
- [roars]

646
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:11,621
- Barry, you can't let Grodd
get free.

647
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,924
Conquer your fears, son.
Believe in yourself.

648
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:38,748
- Come on, come on, come on.

649
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,457
- [exhales]

650
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:50,460
- [heavy breathing]

651
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,597
[laughter]

652
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:02,772
- [grunts]

653
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,475
- Welcome back, Flash.

654
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,445
- Thanks, bro.

655
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,388
- I can't believe something good
finally came from that suit.

656
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,789
- First and the last time.

657
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,558
- That thing still
gives me the creeps.

658
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,293
We should destroy it.

659
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:25,395
- Let's do that, but
see if you can figure out

660
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,896
how to get it back
in this ring first.

661
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,565
Might be nice to have
something like that

662
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,933
instead of carrying around
a bag all the time.

663
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:33,370
- I can help you with that.

664
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,771
What?

665
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,639
I know a thing or two
about micro-technology.

666
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,975
- Yeah, you know a thing or two
about a lot of things.

667
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:41,077
- Well, as long as what he knows
keeps my son

668
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,647
and these good people safe,
the more you know, the better.

669
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,584
Pleasure to meet you, Harrison.
Again.

670
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,019
- Dr. Allen.

671
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,822
- Good to see you.
Cisco.

672
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,592
- Let's go.
- Take care.

673
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,794
- So, Dr. Wells,
this place on your Earth

674
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:01,598
that we've sent Grodd,
what is it exactly?

675
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,469
- It's a refuge where gorillas
subjected to lab experiments,

676
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:11,040
like Grodd,

677
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,043
can roam freely.

678
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:15,412
- I know it's for the best,

679
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:17,046
but I still feel
like I betrayed him.

680
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,984
- No, don't say that.
You didn't betray him.

681
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:24,387
You gave him a better life.

682
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,790
I still don't understand,
though, I...

683
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,058
Why do the breaches
on our Earth

684
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,428
lead to different places
on yours?

685
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,898
- I don't know yet,
Ramon,

686
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,066
but I do know
we have to close them all,

687
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,668
and I don't know
how to do that.

688
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,870
- You don't have to do it
alone anymore.

689
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,639
Any of it.

690
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:46,643
Together, we defeated Grodd,
and if we stay that way,

691
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,745
we will figure out
how to close the breaches,

692
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:52,115
get Zoom,
and get you your daughter back.

693
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:56,152
- Thank you.

694
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:02,492
- Oh, this one is
definitely a keeper.

695
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,461
- [laughs]
Oh, yeah.

696
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:07,597
He could've done your standard
vinegar and baking soda volcano,

697
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,134
but no, Barry wanted to do
a molecular structure

698
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,902
of chocolate and nougat.

699
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,938
- Mm-hmm.
- That's my favorite candy bar.

700
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,039
- Who does that
in the sixth grade?

701
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,576
- Why, a true science nerd.

702
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:23,012
Like father, like son,
I suppose.

703
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,681
- All right, Dad,
we should get going.

704
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,649
- Yeah.
Uh, Joe, can I have...

705
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,552
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

706
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,922
Iris, thank you so much
for reaching out to me.

707
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:37,760
I am so glad you did.
- Me, too.

708
00:36:37,762 --> 00:36:41,498
- Joe, there are no words, man.

709
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,702
Thanks.

710
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,538
- All right, I'm gonna swing by
my lab before I come home.

711
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,708
- Which reminds me--Patty?
She's a smart girl.

712
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,943
She's not buying
your whole sick story, FYI.

713
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,745
- All right.
- Patty?

714
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,981
Would this be a new girlfriend?

715
00:36:57,983 --> 00:37:00,917
- Uh, yeah,
something like that, yeah.

716
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,486
We'll talk about it on the way
to the bus station.

717
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:05,288
Come on.

718
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,292
- Bye.
- See ya.

719
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,966
- You okay?

720
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,169
- [sighs] It's embarrassing.
I--you know, I love Barry

721
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:24,874
like he's my own son, but
when I'm reminded that he isn't,

722
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,743
I start to wonder
what it would've been like

723
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,945
if, you know...

724
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,747
- Dad, you would've been
just as amazing

725
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:34,651
with your own son, just like
you were with me and Barry.

726
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,766
- I hear you've been spending
a lot of time up here.

727
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,969
- [chuckles]
Well, you know what they say.

728
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,705
When the CSI's away...

729
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,174
It's good to see you
on your feet again.

730
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:01,110
Must've been all that
canned soup you had.

731
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:06,015
Or maybe the homemade stuff
Joe brought you?

732
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:08,851
- It--yeah, I wasn't
actually sick, Patty.

733
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,321
- Yeah, I figured that out.

734
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,528
Why did you lie to me?

735
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,896
- My dad was in town.

736
00:38:19,898 --> 00:38:22,065
I needed to spend
some time with him.

737
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:25,568
- And you couldn't
just tell me that?

738
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:30,239
- You gotta understand, Patty,
my dad was convicted of murder.

739
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,675
When someone's image has been
tarnished like that,

740
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:35,979
it's hard for some people
to see past it.

741
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,247
- And you seriously think
I'm one of those people?

742
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,250
- No, I know, I should've
given you more credit.

743
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:44,287
- No, you should've given
yourself more credit.

744
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,122
This isn't about
your father, Barry.

745
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,158
This is about you.

746
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,863
I need to know that I can trust
you if we're gonna do this.

747
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:59,636
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

748
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:01,304
- I can tell.

749
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:04,774
- You cannot always
be a smart ass.
