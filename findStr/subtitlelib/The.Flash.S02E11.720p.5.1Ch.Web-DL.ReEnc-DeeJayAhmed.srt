- No, I can see her later.

Zoom's speed and then we'll get

This is the moment you all
erased him from existence,

is from the future,

243

this is where
his time line begins.

That's why he's still alive.

Not until the future.

he can time travel again,

will that save Barry's mother?

- No.
That's not how it works.

In our time line,
Barry's mother is already dead,

the whole "me leaving" thing.

- Yeah, well, I don't know
what to tell you, Patty.

355
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:29,894
Everyone in my life that I love
leaves at some point.

Kind of getting used to it.

that chance now.

to stimulate the fear receptors
in your brain.

375
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,127
Then I took what you already had
to induce slow-wave sleep,

Never done this before.

402
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,699

with Christina McGee.

404
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:54,906

You can go now.

00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,041
You said you'd release me.

406

Didn't I?

- Dr. McGee is dead?

412
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:26,037
- Harry and I were trying
to hone my powers to find Zoom,

413
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,673
and then we ended up using them,
finding The Reverse-Flash,

414
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,542

I saw him kill her.

And then he left.

416
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,513
- He left?
What do you mean, he left?

417
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:38,216
- McGee built him
some kind of speed machine

418
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,952
and he ran into and got flung
back to the future.

- I'm positive.

429
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,008
There was a clock.

00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:09,180

Dr. McGee is alive.

456

sometimes he helps you out
with S.T.A.R. Labs stuff.

- Yeah, it...
It is weird.

that does make sense

00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,149
you told me I had to
learn how to lie to do it.

You're a terrible liar, Joe.

- Yeah, she knows why.

482

- She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

to be angry.

I have... I have a father.

- Yeah, the same thing happened
to me too, remember?

from seeing her

One moment he was here,
the next... gone.

I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye to him,

to tell him everything
that he meant to me,

00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,919
that he was my world...

498
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,888
that he was loved.

I'll be out here.

876
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:07,437
- So, Patty... she's on a train
to Midway City right now, huh?

877
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:10,006
- Mm-hmm,
I had to let her go too.

878
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:13,610
- Mm-hmm, I was thinking about
what you said,

879
00:40:13,612 --> 00:40:17,981
that part of being The Flash
is that you have the ability

880
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:20,950
to do amazing things
that nobody else can do.

881
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,153
And we see now
that a hundred years from now,

882
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:24,954
you'll still be doing them.

883
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,623
But the other part is,

884
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,626
you're gonna be loaded
with sacrifices,

885
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:32,896
and you're gonna have
hard choices to make,

886
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:37,333
and there's gonna be a lot
of things where eventually

887
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:40,403
you'll have to let 'em go.

888
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:44,507
You got to be ready for that.

889
00:40:44,509 --> 00:40:48,344
- I am.
I'm ready.

890
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:51,581
- That's my boy.

891
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:55,552
[cell phone vibrates]

892
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:58,087
- That's weird.

893
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,690
Hey.
<i>Patty: Barry, I'm on the train.</i>

894
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,492
<i>There's a... there's a man
with a gun.</i>

895
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:05,428
- All right, hold on.
I-I-I'll get you help.

896
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,431

897
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:12,469
<i>¶ ¶</i>

898
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,204
Is everyone okay?

899
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:16,573
- Everyone's fine.

900
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:20,743
It was a false alarm, but...

901
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,612
thanks for coming so fast,
Flash.

902
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:25,615
<i>[gentle music]</i>

903
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:28,318
<i>¶ ¶</i>

904
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,156
- Just want to make sure
everything's okay before I go.

905
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,358
- Don't worry.

906
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,460
Everything's good.

907
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:45,462
<i>¶ ¶</i>

908
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,812
Good-bye, Barry.

909
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,038
- Greg, move your head!
