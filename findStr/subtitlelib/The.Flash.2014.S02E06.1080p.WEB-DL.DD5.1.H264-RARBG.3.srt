00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,206
     <i> To the outside world,</i>

        <i> I'm an ordinary</i>

           <i> like me.</i>

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,583
         <i> I hunted down</i>
 <i> the man who killed my mother,</i>

9
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,718
       <i> but in doing so,</i>
     <i> I opened up our world</i>

        <i> to new threats,</i>

11
00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:24,556

        <i> "The Flash"...</i>

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,364
      - There is, indeed,
     a hole in our universe

15
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:36,201
   which leads to his Earth.

16
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,171
   - Meet Dr. Harrison Wells
         from Earth-2.

17
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:43,475
Do you think we've reached
the good-night kiss stage?

18
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:47,212
       - Zoom is obsessed
          with speed.

19
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,982
           - He has been sending
     meta-humans from your world

20
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:51,850
            through the breaches
                    to fight me.

21
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,752
  - Her name is Doctor Light.

22
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,753
       - Hello, gorgeous.

23
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,955
- What do you want from me?

24
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,591
- Your life.

25
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,793
        - I saw myself.

26
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:04,063
          - Sounds like you have
              an evil meta-twin.

27
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:06,865
- Where are you?

28
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,867
       - I'm right here.

29
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,873
  - I'm here to kill you, Flash,
            so get ready to fry.

30
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,743
         - Bring it on.

31
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,479
Hmm.

33
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,132

34
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,768
       Zoom always wins.

35
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,872
              <i> ♪ ♪</i>

36
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:57,282
               Zoom sent me here
                    to kill you,

37
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,418
           but I didn't want to.

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,553
- But you were fine
with killing Linda Park.

39
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:05,124
   - It was the best bad idea
     I could come up with.

40
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:06,725
         Leave her body
       for Zoom to find,

41
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,795
     he'd think I was dead,
        and I'd be free.

42
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,831
- How was he supposed to know
where to find her body?

43
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:15,234
               - Just let me go.

44
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,636
               Let me disappear.

45
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,004
- You would spend
the rest of your life

46
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,105
looking over your shoulder,

47
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:21,673
never knowing
when Zoom is coming.

48
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:26,178
            - Okay.
  And what's your great idea?

49
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,679
- How were you
supposed to contact him

50
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,647
after you killed me?

51
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,983
                - I was supposed
              to get something--

52
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,318
      something I could only get
              if you were dead--

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,420
               and then throw it
    through the breach as proof.

54
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:37,222
        - And then what?
    - Then he'd come for me.

55
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:39,491
        Confirm the kill
       and bring me home.

56
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,860
    Why do you want to know?
 - Because I want to find him.

57
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,028
             - You really don't.

58
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,830
- He's gonna keep coming
for me.

59
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,665
He's gonna keep
kidnapping people like you,

60
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,067
forcing them to do
what he wants.

61
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,337
I have to stop him
before more people die.

62
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,040
     - You can't stop Zoom.
         - Yes, I can.

63
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,443
I will,
but I need your help.

64
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,716
       - Zoom wants Doctor Light
    to send him your new emblem.

65
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:06,518
             - Yes.
      We need it for bait.

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,821
      If we can get Doctor Light
              to take my emblem,

67
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:11,623
    throw it through the breach,
             then Zoom will come

68
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,692
             to collect my body,
            and we can trap him.

69
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,893
       - You know it took
         a lot of work

70
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:16,395
  to make that emblem, right?

71
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:18,197
      - This is the woman
 who was willing to kill Linda

72
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,665
    in order to escape Zoom,

73
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:22,034
     but now she's willing
     to help us catch him?

74
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,368
                     - She knows
              it's the only way.

75
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,971
    - Before I left Earth-2,

76
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,640
      I worked on a serum
    to dampen Zoom's speed.

77
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,442
       All we would need
          is for Ramon

78
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,977
      to develop a weapon
         to deliver it.

79
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,513
   - Oh, great, that could be
     this year's cold gun.

80
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,847
     Maybe another criminal
          can get it,

81
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,516
       and then we'd have
         Sergeant Slow.

82
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,151
           - I would
     never let that happen.

83
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:40,686
         Sergeant Slow
      is a terrible name.

84
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:43,655
- Are we forgetting
how much more powerful

85
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,057
than Barry
Zoom seems to be?

86
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,825
I mean,
if Barry can catch bullets,

87
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,328
 what's to say Zoom can't catch
   whatever you shoot at him?

88
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,698
                    - Surprise--
        the element of surprise.

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,266
                 All we would do
             is rig a projectile

90
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:56,635
         to fire as Zoom crosses
                into the breach.

91
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:59,104
                   He can't stop
       what he can't see coming.

92
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,272
        - That's great.
           - Thanks.

93
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:02,608
                          - Joe,
           voice of reason here?

94
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,510
       - We need a plan.
     That's as good as any.

95
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,845
   As long as he can deliver.

96
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,046
   - Don't underestimate me,
           Detective.

97
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,618
      - Oh, Patty needs us
      back at the station.

98
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,987
I'll meet you there,
all right?

99
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,461
       - Are you just forgetting
          everything Jay told us

100
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:23,695
       and supporting Wells now?

101
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,397
- Oh, no,
I don't trust Wells at all.

102
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,865
I just want to see
what he's up to.

103
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,834
I figure we give him some rope,
he'll hang himself.

104
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,236
- Yeah, I'm totally with you.
I think he's hiding something.

105
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:34,006
                - Look, my hunch
    after interrogating suspects

106
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:38,543
all these years, something's
not right with this dude.

107
00:04:38,545 --> 00:04:41,647
Barry told me
about this thing you can do?

108
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,049
           - Vibing.
     - Oh, God, just relax.

109
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,418
- Can you do it
with Wells?

110
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,420
          - I can try.

111
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:56,995
         <i> - Incapable?</i>

112
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,830
         <i> Well, let me</i>
      <i> tell you something.</i>

113
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:03,135
     <i> If you are incapable</i>
 <i> of aligning the quantum helix</i>

114
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,703
and, by the way,
the sole purpose

115
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,505
of your employment
here at S.T.A.R. Labs,

116
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,673
could you save me
some time and effort?

117
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,574
Could you go out there
and find someone

118
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:14,046
who can actually
do your job for you?

119
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,815
                  - There it is.

120
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,484
                     Work voice.

121
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,186
               When I was little
        and you used to bring me

122
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,321
      to S.T.A.R. Labs with you,

123
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,922
    it used to freak me out

124
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,124
how differently you talked here
  than when you were at home.

125
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:28,960
- You and your mother both.
Shouldn't you be at school?

126
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,430
       - I graduated high school
             when I was 15, Dad.

127
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,465
            - Right.
  - Can miss a day of college.

128
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:38,036
- Ah, that's my Jess,
always so quick.

129
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:41,073
             - So?
             - So?

130
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:43,008
                   - Is it true?

131
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,543
        - Is what true?

132
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,612
 - What The Flash said about you
        at the press conference?

133
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,917
  That your particle accelerator
        created the meta-humans?

134
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,618
- It is--
Jesse--

135
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,522
                - Why didn't you
                   just tell me?

136
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,391
- Jay Garrick,
it turns out,

137
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:03,228
is much faster
at assigning blame

138
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,030
than he is
at actual heroics.

139
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,199
  - Dad, The Flash is a hero.
           - Uh-huh.

140
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,634
   - Okay, I've never understood
   why you disliked him so much,

141
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:12,838
     but now I know it's because
        he knew what you'd done.

142
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,406
- What I've done
at S.T.A.R. Labs

143
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:16,408
is change the world, Jesse,

144
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,478
unlocking the mysteries
of the universe.

145
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,814
And when you don't have
the key to the lock,

146
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:26,952
sometimes you have
to kick in the door.

147
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,820
You should get to school.

148
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,891
         - Don't worry.
   I got my education today.

149
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,701
        - You're my joy,
          Jesse Quick.

150
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,376
- All right. Talk to you later.
        - See you, Joe.

151
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:53,011
     - Great, you're here.

152
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,312
   - Good morning to you too,
             Patty.

153
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:55,380
- Yes, I was up all night

154
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,515
working on
the Doctor Light case.

155
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,682
I-I've been trying
to anticipate

156
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,284
all the powers
she might throw our way,

157
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,452
you know,
on the premise

158
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,920
that she can manipulate
light energy.

159
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,588
    - I appreciate it, but--
         - Did you know

160
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,824
that light energy
can be turned into hard light?

161
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,192
I mean, that doesn't even sound
like a thing, but it is.

162
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:08,693
            - Seriously, Patty--

163
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,762
- No, and on the other end
of the spectrum is invisibility.

164
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,998
Look, it--it's just
hypothetical, but I think that--

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,968
         - The Doctor Light case
                      is closed.

166
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,938
- Oh, uh, okay.

167
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Can you tell me why?

168
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,475
                           - No.

169
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,712
- No?

170
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,381
             Okay.
             - Hey.

171
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:30,615
             - Hi!
        - Are you good?

172
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,950
         - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

173
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,052
      Your dad just shut me down
                   in a big way.

174
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,922
      - What do you mean?
  - I-I don't know. It just--

175
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:42,427
    You don't think it's because
               you and I kissed?

176
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,495
- Uh, no,
I don't think he knows.

177
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,963
I didn't say anything,

178
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,565
but I can talk to him
if you want.

179
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,866
                   - No, no, no,
               I'll talk to him.

180
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:49,100
                       You know,
                he's my partner.

181
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,769
                  We should have
        trust and communication.

182
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,938
- Are you sure? I don't mind
talking about that kiss.

183
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,005
It was a good kiss.

184
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:58,343
                   - Yeah, yeah,
           although the memory--

185
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,378
            it's a little foggy.

186
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,847
         - Oh, really?
            - Yeah.

187
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,784
             I might need, like,
                a reminder soon.

188
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:08,653
- Okay.

189
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,830
             - Hey.
             - Hey.

190
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,432
         - Have you had any word
                  from The Flash

191
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:23,869
            about the meta-human
             that killed Larkin?

192
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:27,639
- No, not yet,
but I know he's working on it.

193
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,541
                     - You know,
      maybe I could talk to him.

194
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,743
- Linda, I don't think
that's a good idea.

195
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,712
         - Look, Larkin is dead,

196
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,413
      which makes it really hard
           for me to concentrate

197
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,349
                  on field goals
            and doping scandals.

198
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,384
      I don't want to sit around
         being told not to worry

199
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,719
           my pretty little head
                       about it.

200
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,688
- I get that.
Believe me, I do.

201
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,257
                 - Then tell him
                 I want to help.

202
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,726
  Please, I can't let this woman
               who looks like me

203
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,694
               hurt anyone else.

204
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,730
- I'll ask again.

205
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:55,734
But trust me, Flash has
everything under control.

206
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,176
            - Crap.

 None of the security protocols

217
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,830
 - Doctor Light managed to hack
  into the lights of her cell.

218
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,599
       The whole building
      runs on fiber optics

219
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,334
          that operate
      on pulses of light,

220
00:10:02,336 --> 00:10:05,003
so she turned off the dampeners
      and used her powers.

221
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,371
          - I told you
     how dangerous she was.

222
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,973
 You should have listened to me
        and sedated her.

223
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,741
- I thought I had convinced her
that helping us

224
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,109
was the only way
she'd free herself from Zoom.

225
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,310
   - Well, you thought wrong.
            - Yeah.

226

         - Okay, look,

227
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,413
     Doctor Light is gone,
 so instead of assigning blame,

228
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,248
    let's try to figure out
   what we're gonna do next.

229
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,217
 - Do you think she's gonna try
     and take Linda again?

230
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,952
          - I had Iris
   bring Linda to the house,

231
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,787
         just in case,
     to keep an eye on her.

232
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,189
                How are we doing
        with the speed-dampener?

233
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,824
     - I think we isolated
         the composite.

234
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,225
- And we're modifying the dart
The Arrow used

235
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,493
to take down Wells.

236
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,062
       - He's not Wells.
           I'm Wells.

237
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:32,397
- Whatever, Harry.

238
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,265
- But we don't even really know
      if this thing works.

239
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,934
     - Until we try it, no.
   This will be a field test,

240
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,202
         so can we end
this scintillating staff meeting

241
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,737
     and get back to work?

242
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,238
      - Or how about I say
   what everybody's thinking?

243
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,007
    Maybe it's a good thing
   that Doctor Light is gone.

244
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,308
    Maybe it's the universe
          stopping us

245
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,976
      from doing something
         really stupid.

246
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,879
             - No.
        No. Keep going.

247
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:52,117
      I'm gonna figure out
    another way to get Zoom.

248
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,052
     - Hey, slow your roll.
     I want to talk to you.

249
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,988
- Joe, look,
I know what I'm doing.

250
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,024
                - Okay, I don't,
    so why don't you clue me in?

251
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,625
- I'm trying
to stop Zoom.

252
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,793
I thought
you were on board with that.

253
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,795
                   - I'm keeping
                my options open.

254
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,830
- I don't understand
why you think we have a choice.

255
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,399
Zoom wants me dead.

256
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,167
The meta-humans that
he's sending from Earth-2,

257
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,036
they don't care how many
innocent people get in the way.

258
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,104
Look at what happened
to Iris and Linda's boss.

259
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,540
He was just collateral damage
in Zoom's war.

260
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,542
The next time,
that could be you or Iris.

261
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,278
   - I'm just wondering if going
     after him now is premature.

262
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,347
 I mean, we barely know anything
            about his abilities.

263
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,548
- Wells does.

264
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,582
                - You're putting
            a whole lot of faith

265
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,583
                      in the man
                wearing the face

266
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,285
        of your mother's killer.

267
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,921
     I think we should find Jay,
     get him to help us on this.

268
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,923
- Yeah, Jay made it pretty clear
that he doesn't want to help

269
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,125
get me killed,
and we can't just sit around

270
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,294
and wait for Zoom
to make his next move anymore.

271
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:37,696
We can't.

272
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,863
Aren't you the one
who told me

273
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,198
life isn't
about playing defense,

274
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,566
sometimes the only way
to succeed

275
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:42,967
is by working the offense?

276
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:44,135
           - I think at the time
           we were talking about

277
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,637
                your high school
               football tryouts.

278
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,239
- You said
you'd never bring that up again.

279
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:57,182
- Hey.

280
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,985
I just wanted to say using
the, uh, tungsten composite

281
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,988
to dampen vibrations,
that was, uh--

282
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,857
that was pretty brilliant.

283
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,029
           - What are you doing?

284
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:14,365
- I'm congratulating you.

285
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,333
               - Don't touch me.

286
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,935
- Wow, try to give a guy
a compliment.

287
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,269
             - You're not trying
        to give me a compliment.

288
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,537
                   You're trying
           to meddle into things

289
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,839
 that are none of your business.
