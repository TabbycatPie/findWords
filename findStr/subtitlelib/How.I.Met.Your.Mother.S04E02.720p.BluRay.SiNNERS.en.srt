00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,696
<i>Kids, when I first moved to New York,</i>

2
00:00:03,801 --> 00:00:08,704
<i>it was dingy, disgusting,
dirty, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky,</i>

3
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:11,139
<i>and altogether terrifying.</i>

4
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:15,612
<i>But then, sadly,
the whole city started to go uphill.</i>

5
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:18,281
<i>The streets got a little cleaner,</i>

6
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,817
<i>the rents got a little higher,
and one by one,</i>

7
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:23,854
<i>the crappy old places we loved
began to disappear.</i>

8
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:28,393
<i>The Elbow Room, an old punk-rock club,
became a drugstore.</i>

9
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:33,532
<i>McHale's, a working-class watering hole,
became a fast-food place.</i>

10
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:38,229
<i>And Fez, this awesome lounge
at 85th and Broadway, became a bank.</i>

11
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,566
<i>And not just any bank.</i>

12
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:44,167
Goliath National Bank,
the world leader in credit and banking.

13
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,543
God, I love Goliath National Bank!

14
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,310
Okay, first of all,
you look like the last pick in the draft.

15
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,817
And second, why are you so excited
about some bank?

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,914
Our company just bought them out
in a ruthless takeover. Took two months.

17
00:00:57,025 --> 00:01:01,155
Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal.

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,861
Who wants a T-shirt?

19
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:07,161
Hey, Marshall,
they're hiring in the legal department.

20
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,531
I could get you a job.

21
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:11,869
Barney, Marshall didn't quit
his last soul-sucking corporate job

22
00:01:11,974 --> 00:01:16,070
just to go work at a bank.
He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.

23
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:17,702
<i>That was the plan, anyway.</i>

24
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:20,611
<i>Over the next few weeks,
Marshall went on a lot of interviews.</i>

25
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:25,449
You are confident, you are energetic,
you are focused!

26
00:01:25,554 --> 00:01:27,147
<i>A lot of interviews.</i>

27
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:31,694
You are flexible on salary,
you're willing to compromise,

28
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:34,127
you're not gonna cry this time.

29
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,793
<i>Too many interviews.</i>

30
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,460
You are sad, you are beaten down.

31
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:45,736
You will get through this, come home,
get in your big underpants and take a nap.

32
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:51,243
<i>Which brings us to September 29th,
the night of the burger.</i>

33
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,442
So, what do you guys want to do
for dinner?

34
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:56,951
We just got a new cook.
You have to try the burger, it's amazing.

35
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:59,547
- Oh, great, we'll take five of those.
- Five burgers.

36
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:01,751
Whoa, really? You want to eat here?

37
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,795
Yeah, I'm freaking starving.
I just finished a seven-day cleanse.

38
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:06,125
I thought you just started that yesterday.

39
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:08,358
I finished early, okay?

40
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:09,991
- Five of those.
- Five burgers.

41
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:13,197
- Whoa, wait. What about sushi?
- We had sushi last night.

42
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:14,967
- Italian.
- I had Italian for lunch.

43
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:17,043
- I can come back.
- No. We always do this.

44
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:18,940
We spend an hour arguing
about where to eat,

45
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:22,378
and then we end up eating here anyway.
I haven't eaten for two days.

46
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:26,612
Can we please, for the love of God,
just order something now?

47
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:31,452
- Chinese?
- I don't like Chinese.

48
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:34,255
- Indian?
- I just said I don't like Chinese.

49
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,659
Indian isn't Chinese.

50
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:39,961
Weird meats, funny music, side of rice.
Why are we splitting hairs?

51
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,934
- Mexican?
- I just said I don't like Chinese.

52
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:03,548
- Robin, yours will be right out.
- Of course, mine comes last.

53
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,426
Go ahead, start without me.

54
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,690
- Sweet! Thank you.
- You shouldn't have.

55
00:03:08,798 --> 00:03:10,663
That's so kind of you.

56
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,303
Oh, my God. This burger is so good.

57
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:21,810
It's like Christmas in my mouth.
Meat Christmas.

58
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:27,047
It's like an angel from heaven
landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's,

59
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:30,553
where the chef killed it
and ran it through the meat grinder.

60
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:34,716
I love this burger so much,
I want to sew my ass shut.

61
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:37,986
It's okay.

62
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,257
- Are you kidding me?
- Guys, guys, guys.

63
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:42,629
When you've had the best burger
in New York City,

64
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:45,568
every other burger
tastes like my grandpa's feet.

65
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,936
But you guys eat up,
enjoy my grandpa's feet.

66
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,906
Oh, and you've had the best burger
in New York.

67
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:56,239
It was eight years ago,
my first week in New York,

68
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:59,784
and for a kid from Minnesota,
the big city was a scary place.

69
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:07,189
Thank God, it's just you.

70
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:10,525
You are being ridiculous.
Tell me you left the apartment today.

71
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,597
Why would I have to leave?

72
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:14,929
I can have anything I want delivered,
and New York City cable is awesome.

73
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,937
Have you seen this public access show
with the old Jewish lady in a bikini?

74
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,233
It's disgusting.

75
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,501
Marshall, you have to
get over this paranoia.

76
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:23,042
You are not gonna get mugged.

77
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:25,510
Well, what if I do, Ted, all right?
I don't have a switchblade.

78
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,240
I don't know how to breakdance

79
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,213
and win the begrudging respect
of a street gang.

80
00:04:29,317 --> 00:04:31,479
All right, that's it, you're taking a walk.
Come on, go.

81
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:33,282
No.
Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on.

82
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:34,753
I'm just gonna lie back
and get comfortable...

83
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:38,554
- Go! Go outside. Go, go.
- Okay.

84
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:44,495
- Leave the bat.
- Fine.

85
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,530
<i>So I went for a walk in the big, scary city.</i>

86
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:51,971
<i>And I discovered something amazing.
It wasn't scary at all.</i>

87
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,474
All right.

88
00:04:53,943 --> 00:04:55,604
What's the word?

89
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,146
- Hello.
- Your search is over!

90
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:02,845
<i>And then, right when I started
to get a little hungry, I turned a corner...</i>

91
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:09,691
...and there it was.
The tiniest little burger joint you ever saw,

92
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:12,660
tucked between a taxidermist
and a XXX bookstore.

93
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:15,630
Name two places where things get stuffed.

94
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,936
So I went inside.

95
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:22,135
<i>And I ordered the burger.</i>

96
00:05:23,141 --> 00:05:24,506
Thank you.

97
00:06:05,486 --> 00:06:06,475
Ted.

98
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:09,216
Ted, you've got to wake up. Ted, wake...

99
00:06:10,758 --> 00:06:12,692
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

100
00:06:12,794 --> 00:06:14,728
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

101
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,567
Ted. Ted, I've just had
the most amazing burger of my life!

102
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:21,795
It's this awesome little place.
Regis Philbin eats there,

103
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:26,102
so it's sort of like a celebrity hotspot.
But the burger, Ted. The burger.

104
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,676
Dude.
I want one of those burgers right now!

105
00:06:28,777 --> 00:06:30,404
- Do you think they're still open?
- I don't know.

106
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:33,448
Does stuff in New York
stay open past 9:30?

107
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:37,947
<i>So we went out to get another
burger. But after hours of searching...</i>

108
00:06:38,054 --> 00:06:40,352
Damn it! Where is this place?

109
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,917
- You couldn't find it?
- We didn't know our way around.

110
00:06:43,026 --> 00:06:44,891
Just getting back to the apartment
took us three hours

111
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:49,228
- and one very helpful drag queen.
- Wait, Betty Noir was a drag queen?

112
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:54,366
- Well, where do you think it was?
- Probably tucked between her legs.

113
00:06:55,306 --> 00:06:56,534
You know what's not a drag?

114
00:06:56,641 --> 00:07:00,042
Getting a home equity loan
at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.

115
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:02,874
Anyways, we never found the place.

116
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,247
Now eight years have passed,
still no burger.

117
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:13,246
- I couldn't help but overhear.
- Okay, here we go.

118
00:07:13,358 --> 00:07:15,758
- I know the place you're talking about.
- No, you don't.

119
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:19,457
It's a place called The Corner Bistro.
Great burger.

120
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:22,826
Oh! Oh, The Corner Bistro!

121
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,298
It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life

122
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:27,134
searching for the best burger
in New York City,

123
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,902
but silly me, it never occurred to me

124
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,671
to check the highest-rated burger
in the Zagat guide.

125
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:36,307
Wow, thanks a lot, guy.
Let me return the favor.

126
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:39,750
Great cup of coffee? Starbucks.

127
00:07:39,853 --> 00:07:40,877
Shh!

128
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:46,392
So I take it you've tried The Corner Bistro.

129
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:50,624
Robin, I've tried every so-called
best burger in New York City

130
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:55,465
trying to find that burger.
Or at least forget about her.

131
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,289
We're going.

132
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:17,551
But none of those places even came close.

133
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,686
Hey, there was that one time we thought
we had a break in the case, remember?

134
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:25,160
Get this. You know who works out
at my gym? Regis Philbin.

135
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:27,031
The autographed picture.

136
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:31,168
Of course, I remember the place.
It was the best burger I ever had.

137
00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:36,235
I still have dreams about this burger.
Beautiful, haunting dreams!

138
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:40,511
I wake up at night, screaming,
"Get out of my head, burger! Get out!"

139
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:42,108
That's the one, Mr. Philbin.

140
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,246
- Do you remember where it is?
- No! I never wrote it down.

141
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:49,258
But not a day goes by that I don't regret it.

142
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,522
- Why? Why? Do you know where it is?
- No.

143
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,963
And if you tell me it's at The Corner Bistro,
I'm gonna smack you right in the face!

144
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,261
No, we don't know where it is.

145
00:08:56,368 --> 00:09:00,964
Listen, blondie! Don't mess with me!
Daddy needs his meat.

146
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:04,236
I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!

147
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:08,280
What about you, Lurch?
And what about you, satchel-mouth?

148
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,541
Satchel-mouth?

149
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:14,346
This is my cell. You find that burger,
you call me day or night.

150
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,115
Okay, Regis, we will, we will.

151
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,554
All right, so what are you waiting for?
Get out and find the burger!

152
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,319
- All right, all right.
Let's go, all of you!

153
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,029
That's where my story ends.

154
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:28,261
Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever,
searching for that green door

155
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:31,099
and that red neon sign that says "Burger. "

156
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:33,696
Green door,
red neon sign that says "Burger"?

157
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:34,832
- Yeah.
- I know that place.

158
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:38,902
I've walked by it a million times.
It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.

159
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:41,778
I knew it was on a numbered street!

160
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:43,817
- Finally.
- No! Robin!

161
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,855
If any of us is gonna eat a burger tonight,
it's gonna be the best burger in New York.

162
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:49,753
We're going downtown!

163
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:59,160
I cannot believe
we're finally gonna have this burger.

164
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:01,395
Honey, I'm so excited for you.

165
00:10:01,504 --> 00:10:04,530
After all these interviews,
after all these disappointments,

166
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,438
you deserve a triumphant
mouthful of meat.

167
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:11,571
You know what else is a mouthful?
All that double-talk other banks give you.

168
00:10:11,682 --> 00:10:15,413
At Goliath, customer satisfaction
is our most important investment.

169
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,148
Barney, I hate to break this to you,
but working for a bank's kind of lame.

170
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:23,022
Oh, yeah.
How lame is free automatic bill pay, Lil?

171
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:27,962
How lame is 3.3% APY online savings?
Yeah! That's right.

172
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:31,433
Hate to make you look stupid in front
of your friends, but you left me no choice.

173
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,932
We should probably call Regis.

174
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,374
Regis. God, that guy scares me.
I think I'll leave him a text.

175
00:10:39,512 --> 00:10:43,778
Now, Kathy, your last flip was heads.
The one before that was tails.

176
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:47,148
You polled the audience,
they came out split, 50-50.

177
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:52,987
No help at all there. So, for $258,000,

178
00:10:53,726 --> 00:10:56,719
I have to ask you, Kathy,
what's it gonna be?

179
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,230
Heads or...

180
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:05,895
Excuse me.
Oh, boy. I've got to go. I've got to go!

181
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:12,040
Green door, red neon sign.
Guys, this is the place.

182
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,812
No, no, I've actually...
I've prepared a few words.

183
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:15,940
I will eat your hand!

184
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,814
All right, let's just go inside then,
shall we?

185
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,251
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

186
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:21,912
Yours will be right out.

187
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:27,294
- Please, go ahead, start.
- No.

188
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,864
- Just shut up and eat.
- All right.

189
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:36,368
Oh, my God.
I'm never brushing my teeth again

190
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:39,804
unless it's with a toothbrush
made from this burger.

191
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,571
I think I just had my first burg-asm.

192
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:49,912
I want to take this burger out to dinner,
then maybe a movie,

193
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:53,716
then take it back to my place,
put on a little Terence Trent D'arby,

194
00:11:53,823 --> 00:11:57,521
and then I would just fool around
a little bit.

195
00:11:57,628 --> 00:12:00,756
Nothing serious.
Just take it slow, you know?

196
00:12:00,864 --> 00:12:01,956
- This isn't it.
- What?

197
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,193
- Marshall!
- It's not it!

198
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,826
Okay, Marshall,
you might not want to hear this,

199
00:12:06,937 --> 00:12:09,804
but is it at all possible this is
the same burger you had eight years ago,

200
00:12:09,907 --> 00:12:12,433
only it could never live up
to your ridiculously high expectations?

201
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:15,513
- I mean, it is just a burger.
- Just a burger?

202
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:17,972
Just a burger?

203
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:22,110
Robin, it's so much more
than just a burger.

204
00:12:22,887 --> 00:12:25,549
I mean, that first bite...

205
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,360
Oh, what heaven that first bite is.

206
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:33,364
The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast
of an angel,

207
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,026
resting gently on the ketchup
and mustard below.

208
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,536
Flavors mingling
in a seductive pas de deux.

209
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,572
And then, a pickle,

210
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:48,409
the most playful little pickle,

211
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:52,281
then a slice of tomato,
a leaf of lettuce, and a...

212
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:57,290
A patty of ground beef so exquisite,

213
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:01,462
<i>swirling in your mouth,
breaking apart and combining again</i>

214
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:04,429
<i>in a fugue of sweets and savories so</i>

215
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,494
delightful.

216
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:11,834
This is no mere sandwich
of grilled meat and toasted bread, Robin.

217
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:16,343
This is God speaking to us through food.

218
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,941
And you got our wedding vows
off the Internet.

219
00:13:23,285 --> 00:13:27,848
Okay, look, so this isn't the place.
All right, it's no big deal.

220
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:32,053
It's another place with a green door
and a red neon sign that says "Burger. "

221
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:37,464
I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan
and ask them what color their door is.

222
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,001
No big deal, right? Let's do this.

223
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:41,070
Whoo!

224
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:48,405
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say this isn't just about a burger.

225
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:52,471
Marshall's not doing so well, guys.
He really needs to get a job.

226
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:56,417
- Tell them about the underpants.
- What about the underpants?

227
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,120
It started a couple of weeks ago.

228
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:04,257
Heads! It's gonna be heads.
It's almost usually heads.

229
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:07,160
- Hey, baby.
- Hey!

230
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,896
- Did you put on pants today?
- Nope.

231
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:17,040
It was funny at first,
but then it became a daily thing.

232
00:14:17,143 --> 00:14:20,977
I thought, "Okay, well, at least
he's not leaving the house like that. "

233
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,379
Then one day,
he opened the door to get the paper.

234
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:28,316
Day after that,
went downstairs to get the mail.

235
00:14:29,256 --> 00:14:31,781
Everyone's got an underpants radius.

236
00:14:31,892 --> 00:14:35,350
For most of us, it's the distance
from the bedroom to the bathroom.

237
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:39,922
But as your self-esteem gets smaller,
your underpants radius gets bigger.

238
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:43,499
How big is Marshall's underpants radius?

239
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:46,240
We're going.

240
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:54,775
Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.

241
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:56,976
You know, Lil, when times are tough,

242
00:14:57,085 --> 00:15:00,249
I like to remember the uplifting words
of my favorite song.

243
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:04,019
<i>We'll be on your side
when you need a friend</i>

244
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:08,290
<i>Through thick and thin
you can always depend</i>

245
00:15:08,397 --> 00:15:13,664
<i>On the world leaders
in credit and banking</i>

246
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:17,763
<i>Goliath National Bank!</i>

247
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:19,364
Member, FDIC.

248
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,107
We've got to find Marshall that burger.

249
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,511
- Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.
- I'm not eating that burger.

250
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:28,880
No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger,
this isn't the burger.

251
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:30,179
- Finally.
- Excuse me.

252
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,950
- Yes.
- Did you guys change cooks or something?

253
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,888
Because my husband was here
a few years ago,

254
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:36,892
and he's pretty sure
he had a different burger.

255
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:38,154
Yeah, we get this a lot.

256
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:40,457
This place is modeled after
this other place uptown

257
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,089
with the same green door
and "Burger" sign.

258
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,636
- What? Uptown? Where?
- 106th and Manhattan Avenue.

259
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:51,798
Damn it.

260
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:55,545
106. A numbered street. Of course.

261
00:15:57,783 --> 00:16:00,581
- Barney Stinson.
- Barney, where the hell are you?

262
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,884
I'm sorry, this is...

263
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,613
Regis. I'm at the place.

264
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:08,225
Regis, of course.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

265
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:09,920
I forgot to call you. That's not the place.

266
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:12,088
The real place is
on 106th and Manhattan Avenue.

267
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:15,190
- We're headed there right now.
- What? Uptown?

268
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,371
Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20.
If you get there first, medium rare...

269
00:16:24,712 --> 00:16:26,270
- Onions?
- Onions?

270
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,746
- Okay, no onions.
- Stop the cab!

271
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:35,613
Wait. This is it.

272
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,721
Your search is over!
We got girls taking off their clothes!

273
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,228
This is it.

274
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:54,768
One of 9,000 convenient locations.

275
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:04,347
It was right here.
It was right on this very spot.

276
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:06,786
I don't understand.
Where is the burger place?

277
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,552
It's not a burger place anymore,
it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.

278
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,620
- Well, that's fine. Let's just eat here.
- We can't eat here. It's an ATM.

279
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:16,494
But, food.

280
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,692
Ow! Ow!

281
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:18,769
Hey, what the...

282
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,395
This is your fault,
you and your stupid bank.

283
00:17:21,506 --> 00:17:24,031
- You did this.
- It's not my... Stop, okay.

284
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:25,200
Stop it, Lily.

285
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:30,942
I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again.
Goliath National Bank sucks!

286
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,644
It's the worst bank
on the face of the earth.

287
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:38,155
Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks!
They suck!

288
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:41,590
- They suck, suck, suck!
- Marshall, will you just tell her already?

289
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,252
Tell me what?

290
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,995
- Tell me what?
- I got a job.

291
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,502
- What? Where?
- Goliath National Bank.

292
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,997
That's why Barney's been going on and on
about how great Goliath is.

293
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:58,544
He wanted you to be excited for me, since
we're gonna be working there together.

294
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:02,809
Well, technically not together.
You won't have access to my floor.

295
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:06,580
But you want to be
an environmental lawyer.

296
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,053
Yeah, you know, and I also want
to be a Harlem Globetrotter

297
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,817
and get paid in candy, but...

298
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:15,487
In the meantime, I need a job,
and this is a really good one.

299
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:19,032
It's great pay and there's good benefits,

300
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:23,764
and, to be honest, it gives me a reason
to put on pants in the morning.

301
00:18:23,872 --> 00:18:25,703
You know, I have my whole life
to save the planet,

302
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:29,368
but right now, I'm kind of really excited
to wear pants again.

303
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:31,469
You've got great pants.

304
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,171
- I love you.
- I love you.

305
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:36,512
Robin, no!

306
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,881
- They're unopened.
- Give it.

307
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:40,114
- They're barbecue.
- Give it!

308
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:43,818
- I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.
- It's stupid.

309
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:46,520
I think about that first week in New York,
you know?

310
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:50,964
I was 22 years old.
I had my whole future ahead of me.

311
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:55,300
I guess I just kind of thought that
if I could have that burger one more time

312
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:57,499
and feel that way for one more night,

313
00:18:57,608 --> 00:19:01,510
that I might be able
to check that off the list and grow up,

314
00:19:01,612 --> 00:19:04,740
go work for the stupid bank
and just be happy.

315
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:09,713
You know, that burger place isn't gone.
It just moved to a new location.

316
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:12,289
And I can tell you where that is
for 100 bucks.

317
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,620
100 bucks? That's crazy.

318
00:19:16,661 --> 00:19:18,686
- Let's pay the man.
- I paid for the cab.

319
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:21,631
- I don't have any cash.
- I haven't worked since March.

320
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:24,931
Wow, if only there were
an easy, convenient way

321
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:27,267
to get some cash right now.

322
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,839
Member, FDIC.

323
00:19:39,286 --> 00:19:42,312
<i>So we paid the guy, and 20 minutes later...</i>

324
00:19:42,422 --> 00:19:43,480
Thank you.

325
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,718
All right, Marshall, remember,
it might not taste as good.

326
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,660
This place has changed, you've changed,
New York has changed.

327
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:52,733
Just don't get your hopes up
too high, okay?

328
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:05,375
- This is it.
- Yes!

329
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,417
It's exactly the same.
It's the best burger in New York.

330
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:11,418
Go ahead, eat up, eat up.

331
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,920
<i>And so,
after finally tasting again</i>

332
00:20:14,022 --> 00:20:16,490
<i>the burger he'd craved for so many years,</i>

333
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:21,393
<i>Marshall got up the next morning,
put on some pants and went to work.</i>

334
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:23,398
<i>And he never looked back.</i>

335
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,866
I want to get tiny fitted sheets
for this burger

336
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:34,808
and just crawl into this bun,
get all cozy and die there.

337
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:38,905
Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.

338
00:20:40,217 --> 00:20:42,583
This feels so good.

339
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:45,450
I'm worried
I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.

340
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:50,516
If he does get that burger pregnant,
I have dibs on the delicious burger babies.

341
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:53,686
This isn't it.

342
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:56,130
- What?
- No, Regis Philbin!

343
00:20:56,234 --> 00:20:57,292
- That's outrageous.
- Come on.

344
00:20:57,402 --> 00:20:59,267
That is unbelievable!

345
00:21:00,505 --> 00:21:03,133
Wait. This is it! Yes!

346
00:21:04,342 --> 00:21:06,833
- I knew I was getting it, Regis Philbin!
- Bring it!
