1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:03,769
- This season on "the flash"...

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:05,938
- Who are you?
- My name is Jay garrick.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,107
<i>Where I came from,</i>
<i>I was a speedster like you.</i>

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,275
Before I arrived on your earth,
<i>I was in a fight</i>

5
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,377
<i>with a man named zoom.</i>

6
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,978
He will do whatever it takes

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,980
<i>to ensure</i>
<i>he's the only speedster</i>

8
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:15,981
in any world.

9
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,016
- Never forget:

10
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,785
I am the fastest man alive.

11
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,521
- I get these feelings
sometimes, these vibes.

12
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:25,391
<i>- Cisco, what did you see?</i>
<i>- I saw Jay. He's zoom.</i>

13
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,892
- Who's the man
in the iron mask?

14
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,527
- You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

15
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,962
<i>- What do you say</i>

16
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:31,330
you and I give this a shot?

17
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,698
- Yeah, I would like that.

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,199
- I've always
measured my success

19
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,201
by counting the number
of victims I've had.

20
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,669
But now I think I'm going
to start counting

21
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,671
the number of earths
i conquer instead.

22
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,407
- Earth-2 is splitting in half.

23
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,976
Tell me I did not just see
the end of the world.

24
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,645
- Dad? No. No!
- This is what's gonna make you

25
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,480
just like me.

26
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:50,082
- Jay?
No!

27
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:56,321
- No!

28
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,026
Dad?

29
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:02,027
Dad? Hey!
Hey!

30
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,028
Hey, look at me.

31
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,163
Look at me.
Dad.

32
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:05,164
Don't leave.
Not again.

33
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,432
Not again.
Dad!

34
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,733
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

35
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,535
It's all right.
No.

36
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:10,836
Dad.

37
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,224
no, dad.

38
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:34,293
- I told you family
was a weakness.

39
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,466
you feel the anger,
don't you, flash?

40
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:43,268
And now...

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,003
The two of us are the same.

42
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,808
- No! No!

43
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,243
- There you go, flash!

44
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:52,711
Use your anger,

45
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,614
just like I did.

46
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,992
- I got you, zolomon!

47
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:40,993
- Go on, Barry.

48
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,194
Embrace your anger.

49
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,929
End me!

50
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,438
let me do it for you.

51
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,411
so close, Barry.

52
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,615
- Another time remnant.

53
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,650
- You see, Barry,

54
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,185
there could be two of you.

55
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,754
You just have to be willing
to kill yourself.

56
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,391
Yeah.

57
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,092
You're almost ready.

58
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,508
- and comfort us today

59
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,410
with the word of your promise

60
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,179
as we return our brother
to the earth,

61
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,081
and leave us with the hope

62
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,384
that, one day, we'll meet again.

63
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,168
- um...

64
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,237
My father's...

65
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,778
I can't do this right now.

66
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,982
- it's okay, Barry.

67
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,386
- Henry Allen.

68
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:17,789
Henry suffered two
great losses in his life.

69
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,561
He lost his wife, Nora,
and he lost Barry.

70
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,429
He suffered guilt,

71
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,398
embarrassment,

72
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,900
ridicule, shame,
and everything that comes

73
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:32,471
with being blamed for a crime
he didn't commit.

74
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:37,209
Henry Allen was proof
that love can get you

75
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,311
through the darkest of days,

76
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:42,981
and that love will keep him
alive in all of our hearts.

77
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,832
- I'm gonna find him, dad.

78
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:07,239
I promise you I'm gonna take
from him what he took from you.

79
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,929
- hey.

80
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,199
- hey.

81
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,767
- I thought maybe
you should eat something.

82
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,536
- I'm not hungry.
Thank you, though.

83
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:38,704
- Yeah.

84
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,476
Barry, um...

85
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,180
I had no idea that
you were the flash.

86
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,215
What you did for me,

87
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,284
all the things that
you've done for everyone,

88
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,885
this whole city...

89
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,322
And now this
with your dad and zoom.

90
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,893
I'm so sorry.

91
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,662
- Thanks, Wally.

92
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,397
- If there's anything
you need,

93
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,799
you just say the word.

94
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:09,735
- All right.

95
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,738
guys,

96
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,140
zoom's still out there.

97
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,075
We need to come up with a plan.

98
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:19,311
- The man can crack open
breaches to earth-2.

99
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:20,912
I mean, if he can do that,

100
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,581
what else can he do
that we don't know about?

101
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,650
- Right after he killed
his time remnant,

102
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,552
he told me I was "almost ready."

103
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,987
- Almost ready for what?

104
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,055
- I don't know.

105
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,857
- Yep. Classic psychopath.

106
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:34,259
Why can't they ever just say
what they want to do?

107
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,595
We also have to figure out
why I keep vibing earth-2

108
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:39,097
being ripped to shreds.
- Seriously.

109
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,933
- It's like I'm watching
"transformers" in 4-d,

110
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:45,036
but, like,
ten times more realistic

111
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,005
and with much better acting.

112
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,674
- Look, if you can vibe
the future,

113
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,444
we need to stop zoom
before that happens.

114
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,012
- I'm gonna get some air,
all right?

115
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,418
- I got it.

116
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:21,373
- When I was in the speed force,

117
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,408
I felt like

118
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,112
I'd finally come to grips
with her death,

119
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:31,483
with not saving her
when I went back.

120
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,753
And then the moment...

121
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:40,091
Where I'm finally
at the place I can move on,

122
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,260
my father's taken from me.

123
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:48,066
How am I ever supposed
to find peace with that?

124
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,634
- I don't know, Barry,

125
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,670
but you're gonna have
to find a way to do that,

126
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,805
or it's gonna tear you apart.

127
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,645
- I just miss him
so much already.

128
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:10,655
zoom.

129
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,357
- Barry, no!

130
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,361
- Bad time, flash?

131
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,866
Thought I'd give you
some time to mourn.

132
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,634
- This ends now.

133
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,035
- Not yet.

134
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,605
There's always more to take,
Barry.

135
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,340
- You're gonna
stay away from them.

136
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:30,008
- Well, that's
completely up to you.

137
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,177
- What?
- When we first met,

138
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,813
I told you that zoom
needed to be the best.

139
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:39,017
You just didn't realize
i was talking about myself.

140
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,852
- Is that what this is about?

141
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,154
- A race, Barry,

142
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,023
between you and me...

143
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,192
To see who's the fastest.

144
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,460
You win: This is over,

145
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:49,728
and you get to be the hero.

146
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,363
- I'm not racing you.

147
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,832
- Then your father won't be
the only person you love

148
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:55,867
that I'll take from you.

149
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,736
Think about it, flash.

150
00:08:57,738 --> 00:09:00,906
All I want to know is
who's the fastest man alive

151
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,842
on either world.

152
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:04,876
I'll be waiting.

153
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,086
- so zoom wants to race you?

154
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,655
- He's obsessed
with being the best.

155
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,056
- Why would we trust him?

156
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,758
- He just wants to race.

157
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,560
You know,
it actually makes sense

158
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,162
in a completely-off-your-rocker
sort of way.

159
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,031
- That can't be
everything he wants.

160
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,098
- It isn't.

161
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,667
This magnetar

162
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,403
that's being developed
by Mercury labs--

163
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,104
turns out,
it can act as a pulsar.

164
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,506
- Whoa.

165
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:37,108
- What is a pulsar?

166
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,110
<i>- It's a power amplifier</i>
<i>with a highly magnetized,</i>

167
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,413
<i>dense rotating core</i>

168
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,782
<i>that can be</i>
<i>easily weaponized.</i>

169
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:47,185
- Nah, that's not
dangerous at all.

170
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:49,020
- That's what happens
to earth-2.

171
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:51,389
What happens in my vibes
is because of this machine.

172
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,725
- That thing is powerful enough
to destroy a planet?

173
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:54,960
- A lot more than just a planet,

174
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,595
if it has
the right power source.

175
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:57,896
- Like what?

176
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,464
- Like me.

177
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:01,132
That's why he wants to race.

178
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,569
He wants to siphon
the energy I create when I run.

179
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:06,538
- He wants to siphon the energy
off both of you.

180
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,039
- When Jay captured me,

181
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,975
he said that he used
to measure his success

182
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,110
by counting the number
of victims he had,

183
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,812
but now he was gonna measure it

184
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,581
by counting the number
of earths he conquered instead.

185
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,317
- He doesn't want
to just destroy earth-2;

186
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,786
he wants to take out every
other planet in the multiverse.

187
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,821
- How many are there?

188
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:24,255
- Infinite.

189
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,391
- Yeah, well, he can do that?

190
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,793
- If he can create a breach
to earth-2 all on his own...

191
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,228
- He can get to all of 'em.

192
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,298
- One pulse
to destroy them all.

193
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,066
- I guess I don't have a choice.

194
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,969
I have to race him.

195
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,406
and I have to win.

196
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,981
- bare.

197
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,517
Don't race him.

198
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,652
- It's not that easy.

199
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,253
- Yes, it is.
You just say no.

200
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,521
We find another way
to stop him,

201
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,956
together, like we always do.

202
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,924
- And do what, Joe?

203
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:02,694
Just sit around and wait for him
to kill somebody else?

204
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,964
Wally? Iris? You?

205
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,532
No. No way.

206
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:09,668
- He needs you, bare.
He needs your speed again

207
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,769
to get what he wants.

208
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,772
We have the advantage here.

209
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,041
- All I have to do
is beat him, Joe.

210
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,943
That saves the multiverse,
this whole city,

211
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,146
all of you.

212
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,981
I won't let
another person I love die

213
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:25,617
when I can prevent it.

214
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,552
- This...

215
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,522
Isn't just about
racing zoom, is it?

216
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,359
You want to kill this guy.

217
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,661
- Of course I want
to kill him, Joe.

218
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,530
I want to do a hell of
a lot more than just kill him.

219
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,466
I want him to suffer
for everything that he's done.

220
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:42,467
And he's going to.

221
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:44,069
- Come on, bare.

222
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:46,638
Think about
what you're saying.

223
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,075
- I have to be willing
to do whatever it takes.

224
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:52,377
I'm sorry, but I'm racing him,
whether you want me to or not.

225
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,847
- And I can't
talk you out of it?

226
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,082
- Not this time.

227
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,184
- Then I'm sorry too.

228
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,771
wha...

229
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,244
what are you doing?

230
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:34,385
Why did you put me in here?

231
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,421
- Because you're
too angry right now.

232
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,423
You can't race him like that.

233
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,925
Without a plan, you're--
you'll lose.

234
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:44,729
- Keeping me in here
is gonna get everyone killed.

235
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,265
I'm the only one that can
stop him; You know that.

236
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,802
- You race zoom on his terms,

237
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,070
you'll lose.

238
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,239
- This is not
your decision to make!

239
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,875
- It is this time.
- No.

240
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,611
- We all made it together.

241
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,447
- What?

242
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,481
All of you?

243
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,250
- Bro, I went back and forth.

244
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,252
I was, like,
a good 60/40 at first.

245
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:09,087
- Ramon.

246
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,723
- Yeah, yeah,
we all made the decision.

247
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,458
- Come on.

248
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,493
- Allen.

249
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,995
Allen.

250
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,430
This is for your own good.

251
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,799
- Don't do this.

252
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,600
Guys, come on.
Iris?

253
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,469
Cisco, come on, man.

254
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,470
You have to let me--

255
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,938
you have to let me stop him!

256
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,640
You have to let me...

257
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,613
- did we make
the right call here?

258
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,881
- Yeah, we did.

259
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,624
- You okay, Joe?

260
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,026
- Yeah, that was just
a little harder

261
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,027
than I anticipated.

262
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:50,762
- Yeah, locking up Barry...

263
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,598
That was the easy part.

264
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,866
Now, using our plan

265
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:58,102
to take down zoom
without Barry,

266
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,437
that's gonna be
the hard part,

267
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,605
but it's gonna be
a lot easier

268
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,973
once we know
where he is, Ramon.

269
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,042
- Chill, man.
I'm working on it.

270
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,544
- Work harder.
- Got it.

271
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:08,146
He's at the industrial park
on leawood.

272
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,314
Give me that.
- Yep.

273
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,849
- Mm.

274
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,617
- That is some serious
nerd love right there.

275
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,352
- Snow.

276
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,322
Look, everybody here
would understand

277
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,024
if you don't want
to go through with this.

278
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,526
- Jay may be a monster,

279
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,294
but there's a human
inside of him somewhere.

280
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,129
I've gotten
to that part of him before.

281
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:26,397
I know I can do it again.

282
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,233
I want to stop him, Harry,

283
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,002
for good.

284
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,971
- Ramon.

285
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,707
- So let's go over
the plan again.

286
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,009
- Okay, Caitlin
will distract Jay

287
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:40,044
so that you and Harry
can hit him with the boot.

288
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,379
Cisco's gonna open the breach,

289
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,147
and we're gonna
put him through it.

290
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,415
- I'll disarm the magnetar.

291
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,217
- Destroy the magnetar...

292
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,052
- Save the multiverse.

293
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,921
- One more thing.
We need to agree.

294
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,756
We all made
this decision together,

295
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:55,894
so if anything goes wrong,
we stick with it.

296
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,829
- Let's load up.

297
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:12,577
- hey.

298
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,013
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

299
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,281
- You know,
I've just been thinking.

300
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,249
You know, what's--what's next?

301
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,250
- What's next?

302
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,886
We stop zoom.

303
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:22,954
- Right.

304
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,355
Right, I guess--

305
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,057
I don't know, I mean--
after that.

306
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,693
- I don't know. Haven't
really given it much thought.

307
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,695
- Yeah, no--
no, I know you haven't.

308
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:33,464
Guess I've just--I've been
thinking about it a lot lately.

309
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,100
You know, I see the way you are
with everyone here--

310
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,136
Caitlin and cisco,

311
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,804
Iris and Joe,

312
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,973
Barry,

313
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,274
especially Barry.

314
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,044
You care about
these people a lot.

315
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:49,213
You know, but--
but my friends?

316
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,615
They're all back home

317
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,483
on our earth.

318
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,218
I guess what
I'm trying to say is,

319
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,588
you know,
when this is all over,

320
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,890
I'm gonna go back home

321
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,124
to live my life.

322
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,459
But if you need to stay here

323
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,762
so that you can live yours
again, I get that.

324
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:05,930
I understand.
It's okay, because--

325
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,465
- i--
- no, dad.

326
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:11,135
Seeing you happy,

327
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,272
that is all I've ever
wanted for you.

328
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,823
<i>- okay. In position.</i>

329
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,758
- Copy that.
We got you.

330
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,527
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>Snow, you ready?</i>

331
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,129
- As ready as I can be.

332
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,434
- cisco.

333
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,004
Cisco, you good?

334
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,438
- Define "good."

335
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,775
- Ramon.
You're gonna be great.

336
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,143
Snow.

337
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,478
<i>When you're ready.</i>

338
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,880
- Okay.

339
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,383
- You got this.

340
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,651
- Here we go.

341
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,158
<i>Jay?</i>

342
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,493
- Caitlin.

343
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,196
- Jay!

344
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,670
- How did you find me?

345
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:22,540
- Doctor McGee said the magnetar
was stolen from her labs.

346
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,342
I knew that it had to be you,

347
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,844
so I tracked you here.

348
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,547
I tracked you here, Jay.

349
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,884
No one else knows.

350
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,920
- I told you, if you left me--

351
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:37,255
- that if I betrayed you,

352
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,357
you'd show me no mercy,
i know.

353
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,759
But I just want
to explain why I did that.

354
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:44,562
Please, Jay.

355
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,696
- Talk.

356
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,098
- Good job, girl.

357
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,267
<i>Now draw him towards you.</i>

358
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,369
- I made a mistake.

359
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:54,939
I am so sorry
that I abandoned you.

360
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,240
But you have to understand,

361
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,276
what you said to me--

362
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:01,079
that there was
a dark side of me--

363
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,248
<i>that I was more like</i>
<i>killer frost than I knew--</i>

364
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,751
I didn't want to accept that.

365
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:10,421
I tried to lock the darkness
inside of me.

366
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:15,093
But you knew that that was
already a part of me now.

367
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,795
And you're
the only one who did.

368
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:23,301
And now, I'm ready to accept
who I really am.

369
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,570
- Cisco, get ready.

370
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:29,907
- I am so sorry
that I hurt you.

371
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:34,545
But now I want to be the one
that only you know.

372
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,280
Please, Jay.

373
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,982
Let me try.

374
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:46,591
- one more step.

375
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:50,294
- I knew you'd eventually
come around, Caitlin.

376
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,233
but it's too late.

377
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,772
- Now, Ramon!

378
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,812
- damn it.

379
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,813
- Tranq him!

380
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,081
Tranq him!

381
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,315
- Gun is jammed!

382
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,765
- dad!

383
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,451
- did you see my dad?

384
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,153
- No, the vibe keeps changing.

385
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,355
It's like my brain
is channel surfing or something.

386
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,623
- They must be on the move.

387
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,891
That's why the vibe's in flux.

388
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,327
Keep trying.

389
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,695
Hey, did you turn off
the magnetar?

390
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,163
- No, there's no messing
with that thing.

391
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,698
Whatever he did to it--
we try and touch it,

392
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,635
we try and move it--
this planet's done for.

393
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,971
- Iris.

394
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:09,874
What's wrong?

395
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,880
- Zoom took dad.

396
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,748
- What? How?

397
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,984
- We tried to stop zoom by
pushing him through the breach,

398
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:22,987
but he took Joe with him.

399
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:24,755
- Well, where's Barry?
Did he go after him?

400
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:29,060
- He's not with us.
He's in a cell in the intake.

401
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:33,231
- Wait, you--you tried
to stop zoom alone?

402
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,565
- Long story.

403
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,872
- Well, we have to get him back.

404
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:44,942
- Wally, before zoom took dad,
we all agreed

405
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,277
that if we got him
off this earth,

406
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,845
we would close
the breaches for good,

407
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:52,250
and we would never
open them again,

408
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,786
under any circumstances.

409
00:20:55,788 --> 00:21:00,057
- Why--why would you do that?

410
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:02,426
No. No way,
that's not gonna happen.

411
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,861
- He made us all agree to it.

412
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,529
- Well, guess what.
I didn't agree to that.

413
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,597
- Wally--

414
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,300
- Iris, I already
lost my mom.

415
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,702
If dad...

416
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,404
I--

417
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:31,489
- I will say,

418
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:35,626
if anything, Barry sure has an
ample number of fathers to kill.

419
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,895
- If you're gonna kill me,

420
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,297
kill me.

421
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,332
It doesn't matter.

422
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:42,900
You're not racing anybody.

423
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:44,302
- Come on, Joe.

424
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,437
You know Barry better than that.
You raised him.

425
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,639
He'll say yes
if he thinks he can save you.

426
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,107
- Not this time.

427
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,842
I made sure of it.

428
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,480
Who is that?

429
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,249
- It would just confuse you.

430
00:21:58,251 --> 00:21:59,417
- Try me.

431
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,356
- I got my speed
the same way Barry did.

432
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,491
<i>When I got struck by the</i>
<i>dark matter and electricity,</i>

433
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,428
<i>I became zoom,</i>
<i>the fastest man alive.</i>

434
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,264
<i>Wasn't long before I had</i>
<i>this earth on its knees.</i>

435
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,498
<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

436
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,967
I wanted more.

437
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,203
I wanted to be faster.

438
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,372
<i>So I created a speed drug.</i>

439
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,973
- Velocity-9.

440
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,376
- It made me faster
than I ever thought possible,

441
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,211
<i>fast enough to break</i>
<i>the dimensional barrier,</i>

442
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,779
<i>fast enough</i>
<i>to run to other universes,</i>

443
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,214
<i>other earths.</i>

444
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:33,851
And then, one day,
on one of those other earths,

445
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,353
I discovered him.

446
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,121
- He's another speedster?

447
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,190
- Yeah, you could say that.

448
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,326
That was right about the time
i discovered something else too.

449
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:43,961
All that v-9 I'd been injecting

450
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,731
<i>into my system</i>
<i>had a little side effect.</i>

451
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,899
- It was killing you.

452
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,835
- I searched for a cure.

453
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,636
I tried everything.

454
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,405
I even tried to manipulate
the speed force,

455
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,707
but let me tell you,
the speed force,

456
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,809
the speed force does not like
its rules being broken.

457
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:02,713
<i>Now it's been sending its</i>
<i>enforcers after me ever since.</i>

458
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,817
- So you brought him here
to steal his speed.

459
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,153
- I tried, but it wouldn't take.

460
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,188
<i>But then the skies parted,</i>

461
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,556
<i>and I saw Barry,</i>

462
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,692
<i>and then I stole his speed.</i>

463
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:15,993
<i>I won.</i>

464
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:18,863
I beat the rules
of the speed force.

465
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:22,066
- Why keep him here?

466
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,335
- Trophy.

467
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:27,171
And a little idea I had for fun.

468
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:31,509
You see, I got so tired
of being the villain,

469
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,512
<i>so I decided</i>
<i>to be the hero too.</i>

470
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:37,515
I even borrowed his name,

471
00:23:37,517 --> 00:23:41,852
Jay garrick.

472
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,923
You know what's gonna be
great, detective?

473
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,725
After I beat Barry in the race

474
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:50,060
and prove that I'm the fastest
man alive on any earth,

475
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,395
he's gonna rot in a cage

476
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:53,898
just like the one
Jay's in now.

477
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,568
And then I'll have a flash
from two worlds

478
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,270
to keep me company.

479
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,950
- Look.

480
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,652
Everyone's gonna freak
when they find out I did this,

481
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,587
but I don't care.

482
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,822
We need your help, Barry.

483
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,063
- Uh, hey, guys,

484
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:27,465
Barry's not...

485
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,833
In his cell anymore.

486
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:30,334
- Wally!
- What? I wasn't just gonna

487
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,602
stand here and let this happen.

488
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:32,970
- You let him take Joe?

489
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,772
What the hell were you thinking?

490
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,307
- Allen, there was
nothing we could do.

491
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,575
- You could've let me race him!

492
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,910
- Allen!
You're not racing zoom!

493
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,612
- What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna tranq me again?

494
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:43,347
- Don't tempt me.

495
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,616
- Look, I know you guys made
a pact to keep zoom on earth-2,

496
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:47,451
but you did that
without me and Wally.

497
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,253
All right?
You don't get to do that!

498
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,622
- Barry, look at yourself
right now; You're not okay.

499
00:24:51,624 --> 00:24:53,524
- Cisco, my dad was just killed
in front of me!

500
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:54,959
Do you have any idea
how that feels?

501
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,527
- Watching someone you love die?

502
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,795
Yes, I do.

503
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:58,963
- Cait--

504
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,030
- look, Barry.

505
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,600
I know how cold and angry

506
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,535
and distant that can make you.

507
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,803
But when this happened to me,

508
00:25:05,805 --> 00:25:08,138
you were the one
who kept me in check.

509
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,807
You told me to stop
and take a breath,

510
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,142
and that's all
we're telling you to do now.

511
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:13,644
- I'm telling you
I'm good.

512
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,513
- Really?
You're good?

513
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,515
Because it seems to me you
want to do more than stop zoom.

514
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:19,316
It seems to me you want revenge.

515
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,551
If that's why you're doing this,

516
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,920
Allen, you will lose.

517
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:26,457
- Look, you guys.

518
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:29,293
I--you may not think
i can do this.

519
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,061
You may think I'm too angry.

520
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:33,864
But we're running out of time!

521
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,199
I have to beat him,

522
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,634
and I'm going to,

523
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:38,869
whether I have your help or not.

524
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,571
So which one is it?

525
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,874
So how does this work?

526
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,142
- It's the same way
we took Iris

527
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,377
into the speed force.

528
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,012
Harry does
his best Frankenstein,

529
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,681
you hold my hand,
and I vibe you there.

530
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,216
- All right, let's do it.

531
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,894
I'll do it.

532
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,063
Say when and where.
I'll be there.

533
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:09,099
- Cisco's learned how to bring
people into his vibes.

534
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,035
- There's one condition.

535
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,102
You bring Joe back.

536
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,939
But if he's harmed in any way,

537
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:16,006
it's off.

538
00:26:16,008 --> 00:26:17,508
- I'll bring him,

539
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,910
and I won't release him
until after we race.

540
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,946
Deal?

541
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,315
- Deal.

542
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,627
- I tell you,
Jay might be crazy-pants,

543
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:38,862
but he can pick a venue.

544
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:46,370
- Brought the whole crew
with you, huh?

545
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:47,972
Can't say I blame you.

546
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:49,406
- Dad.
- Wally!

547
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:51,408
- It's gonna be
one hell of a show.

548
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,110
- Let him go.

549
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,145
- After we race.

550
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,815
- Cut the crap. We know you plan
to power up the magnetar

551
00:26:57,817 --> 00:27:00,284
so you can destroy
the multiverse.

552
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:03,220
- Bravo.
You figured it out...

553
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,788
Almost.

554
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,590
I don't want
to destroy all of it.

555
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,959
This earth is at the center
of the multiverse.

556
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,630
It's the access point to every
other earth in existence.

557
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:16,600
One trans-dimensional shockwave,
and...Poof.

558
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:18,335
- Leaving just our earth.

559
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,504
How generous of you.

560
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,973
- Need to have some place
to hang my cowl.

561
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,844
You might want
to say your good-byes.

562
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,520
- don't worry.

563
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,522
I'm gonna save your dad.

564
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:39,590
- No.

565
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:41,925
You're gonna save our dad.

566
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,827
- Get back to s.T.A.R. Labs.
It's safer.

567
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,462
- We're not going anywhere.

568
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:47,197
We got eyes and ears right here.

569
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,465
- Either he goes,

570
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,167
or we all die together.

571
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,872
- we believe in you.

572
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,310
- wait.

573
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,546
Barry,

574
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:03,981
kick his ass.

575
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:11,955
- what are the rules?

576
00:28:11,957 --> 00:28:13,724
- One lap around
the inside of this loop

577
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,993
will produce about
1 gigawatt of energy,

578
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,796
and I need 500-plus
to power the magnetar

579
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:20,364
enough to do the job.

580
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,166
Once it's full, I win,

581
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,568
because there is
no stopping it.

582
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,070
- So all I have to do
to beat you

583
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,706
is stop you before that happens.

584
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:31,008
- Yep.
It's that simple.

585
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:34,812
But if, at any point, you decide
you don't want to race anymore,

586
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:37,081
dear old dad number two
is a dead man,

587
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,917
as well as
your little fan club.

588
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,052
- They're not my fan club.

589
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,988
They're the reason
that I'm running,

590
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,490
why I'm gonna beat you.

591
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,429
Let's see what
you're made of, flash.

592
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,501
- just say when, zoom.

593
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:59,603
- Run, Barry.

594
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,604
Run!

595
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,961
- he's powering up the magnetar.

596
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,803
- come on, Barry.
Catch up.

597
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:45,449
- which one's Barry?

598
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,251
- Both of them.

599
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,153
He made a...
Both: Time remnant.

600
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,993
- go, all right?
Go!

601
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:58,128
I'll explain later, Joe.

602
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,467
- a remnant?

603
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:06,804
Stole my trick, flash.

604
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:10,207
But you're too late.

605
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,146
Bye-bye, multiverse.

606
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,514
- No!

607
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:29,159
- what's the time remnant doing?

608
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,028
- He's creating his own pulse.

609
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,797
- Why would he do that?
- Because...

610
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,799
If that's out of phase,

611
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,668
it'll counteract that one.

612
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,803
- Wait, his body
can't handle that.

613
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:42,306
- Then what's gonna happen?

614
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:44,107
- He'll die.

615
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,731
- ahh!

616
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,606
ahh!

617
00:31:19,645 --> 00:31:21,311
You're a hero, Barry.

618
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,748
You couldn't kill me before.

619
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,351
You won't kill me now.

620
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,925
- I don't have to.

621
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:38,562
- Ahh!

622
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,857
- okay, so you ran back in time

623
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:09,593
and made a copy of yourself?

624
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,629
- Well, uh, basically.

625
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:13,764
Yeah.

626
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,933
- It's called a time remnant.

627
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:19,870
- It's not something
that I can do every day,

628
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:22,539
but I needed a way
to draw the time wraiths

629
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,607
out of the speed force,

630
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,242
hoping they'd be more upset

631
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,210
at what zoom had done
than they'd be with me.

632
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,478
- Is that what I look like

633
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,280
when they start
talking about science?

634
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,448
- Pretty much.

635
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,549
- Don't worry, Wally.

636
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,284
It'll get easier to understand.

637
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:36,320
- Well, how does that
even work?

638
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:37,988
- Same way zoom did it.

639
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,658
I ran back in time
moments before I left.

640
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,894
It's the only way I can be
in two places at once.

641
00:32:43,896 --> 00:32:47,731
- Okay, so the time remnant,
it's still you?

642
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:48,799
- Yeah.

643
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,735
- But he died.
- Uh...

644
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:55,605
He was willing to sacrifice
himself for all of us.

645
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,908
- That's how much he loved us.

646
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,744
- You know what? We'll just--
we'll forget about it.

647
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,679
Barry, I'm glad you're okay.

648
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:03,847
- You know what?

649
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,916
In battle,
choose your weapon wisely.

650
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:07,150
All right?
Some people choose a gun.

651
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,019
I choose a Phillips-head
screwdriver.

652
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,754
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
You're so particular.

653
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:11,989
- Ramon, can you just please--

654
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,123
have you ever worked
with a tool before?

655
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,124
- I'm working with one now.

656
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,125
- Are you ready?

657
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:16,293
One,

658
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,427
two,

659
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:18,428
and...

660
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,799
- Ugh.

661
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:24,801
I don't know
what's more annoying,

662
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,370
being in that thing

663
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:28,038
or listening to you two
arguing about it.

664
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,287
- um...

665
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,522
You're--

666
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,391
- I'm Jay garrick,

667
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:50,327
the real Jay garrick.

668
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:56,500
what?

669
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:57,834
- I'm sorry. I--I'm sorry.

670
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,314
- bare.

671
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:12,849
- He looks just like him.

672
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,351
He looks just like my dad, Joe.

673
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,385
I can't believe this.

674
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,553
My dad told me.

675
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,821
He told me this.
He said

676
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,023
his mom's maiden name
was garrick.

677
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,558
I just never thought that
that meant--

678
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,160
- Barry, Barry.
- I never thought it meant--

679
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,895
- Barry, he doesn't know that.

680
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,430
He doesn't know

681
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,732
that he's your dad's
doppelganger, okay?

682
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,902
You want me to tell him
that you had to leave?

683
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:33,670
- No. No.

684
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:34,905
- You sure?

685
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:36,006
- Yeah.

686
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,874
I just need a minute.

687
00:34:37,876 --> 00:34:39,342
I'll be all right.

688
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,283
- that's smart.
- Because of--

689
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:47,784
yeah, and there it is.
- Genius.

690
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,454
- So the reason
you didn't have your powers

691
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:52,889
is because there
was a dampener in the mask.

692
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,058
You see?

693
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,394
- I don't want
to see this thing ever again.

694
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,899
- So your powers are back.

695
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,969
- I see Jay--
excuse me--hunter--

696
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:07,771
stole your color scheme too.

697
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,606
- He took a lot
of things that were mine,

698
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:10,874
except for that.

699
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,143
That's, um--
that's all him.

700
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:15,312
- He said it was his father's
from the war.

701
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,982
- Ironically,
on my--on our earth--

702
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,951
this helmet stood for hope.

703
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:23,553
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

704
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:27,557
- Well, maybe I can continue
that sentiment,

705
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,327
take something from him,
for a change,

706
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,563
make it my own.

707
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,602
- it suits you.

708
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,904
- Thank you,
all of you,

709
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:44,641
for saving me from zoom,

710
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,278
especially you, flash.

711
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,513
- You're welcome,

712
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:50,780
flash.

713
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,920
- now all I have to do
is find my way home.

714
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:58,288
- And where's that?

715
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,790
- I think you would call it
earth-3.

716
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:03,760
- Uh-huh.
Well, I can get you to earth-2.

717
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,029
- My daughter and I can help you
with the rest.

718
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,365
- We can?

719
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,834
- Yes, we can.

720
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,969
We're going home.

721
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,509
okay.

722
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:25,682
snow.

723
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,818
You're a tremendous scientist,
but...

724
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,620
You're an even better person.

725
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,689
- Don't make me cry, Harry.

726
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,424
I've done enough of that
already.

727
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,162
- Detective Joe west...

728
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,564
- Harry.

729
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:42,399
- You have great kids.
You take care of them.

730
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,967
- Same to you.

731
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,503
You take care
of that beautiful girl.

732
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:49,839
- Yes, sir.

733
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,441
- Hey.

734
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:58,915
- I'm a better man than I was
when I got here,

735
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,083
and that's 'cause of you.

736
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,819
- I'm not the same either.

737
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,688
- Hey, don't be surprised

738
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,556
if I project myself
over to earth-2

739
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,024
every once in a while,
you know,

740
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,893
just to throw your stuff
across the office.

741
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:15,098
- I'll miss you too,
cisco.

742
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:24,174
- So I guess I can't text you
from another earth, huh?

743
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:26,376
- I guess not.

744
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:27,611
- That's too bad.

745
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:34,751
Thank you guys, seriously,

746
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,186
for saving our home.

747
00:37:36,188 --> 00:37:38,088
- Mm-hmm.
- Ready?

748
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,956
- Yeah.

749
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,351
- can't stop thinking
about my dad's doppelganger.

750
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:44,120
Seeing him,
knowing that he's out there,

751
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,655
that should've made it easier.

752
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,357
It doesn't.

753
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,859
It just made me miss him
even more.

754
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,163
- I can't even imagine
how hard that must have been.

755
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:55,799
- We just won.

756
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:58,435
We just beat zoom.

757
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,970
Why does it feel
like I just lost?

758
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,875
- because you've lost a lot
in your life, Barry,

759
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,945
more than most.

760
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,881
But...

761
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,319
Maybe you and me

762
00:39:16,321 --> 00:39:19,222
seeing where
this thing goes,

763
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:22,726
maybe that can give you
something for a change.

764
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,199
- That's all I've ever wanted
to hear you say.

765
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,901
And I wish that
i was in a place

766
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:34,804
where I could try that
with you.

767
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:38,541
But I feel so hollowed out
inside right now.

768
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:42,846
I feel more broken
than I've ever felt in my life.

769
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:45,682
If I'm ever gonna be
worth anything to you,

770
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:48,852
I need to fix
what's wrong with me.

771
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:53,022
I need to find some--
some peace.

772
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:59,329
- Barry, listen to me.

773
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:02,031
You waited for me
for years.

774
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,402
You let me get to a place
where this was possible.

775
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,837
So I am telling you

776
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,541
I am gonna do
the same thing for you.

777
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,710
Wherever you need to go,

778
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:16,112
whatever you need to do,

779
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:18,615
do it.

780
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:21,718
And when you get back,
I'll be here.

781
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,454
- okay.

782
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:27,056
- I love you, Barry.

783
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,774
- I love you too.

784
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,943
And I always will.

785
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,363
that's why I'm so sorry.

786
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,367
But I have to do this.

787
00:41:26,518 --> 00:41:29,452
- Barry!
- Mom!

788
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,126
- Barry!

789
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:38,495
No!

790
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,029
No.

791
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:51,307
you're not gonna kill her
this time.

792
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:53,843
You're not gonna kill her
ever again.

793
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,635
- no.

794
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:21,004
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

795
00:42:21,006 --> 00:42:22,539
I'm not gonna hurt you.

796
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,806
Okay?

797
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:26,409
I'm not gonna hurt you.

798
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,478
You're safe.

799
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,784
You're safe now.

800
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,180
<i>- Greg, move your head.</i>
