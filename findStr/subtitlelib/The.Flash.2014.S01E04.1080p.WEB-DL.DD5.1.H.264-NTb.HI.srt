00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:05,136
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:08,115
When I was a child
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:10,034
by something impossible.

4
00:00:10,036 --> 00:00:13,070
My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:17,008
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,710
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,547
but secretly, I use my speed
to fight crime

8
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:24,465
and find others like me.

9
00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:26,884
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

10
00:00:26,886 --> 00:00:27,952
Mom!

11
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:29,387
And get justice for my father.

12
00:00:29,389 --> 00:00:31,806
I am the Flash.

- Barry Allen.
- Felicity.

- [Gasps]
- How's Barry doing?

17
00:00:41,284 --> 00:00:43,033
- It's a secret.
- What kind of secret?

18
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:44,251
The kind I have to keep.

19
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,203
I just have
a little experience

20
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:49,690
with liking someone who doesn't
see you the same way.

21
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,625
- Dad, the thing is--
- You two are dating.

22
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:54,378
- So you're not mad.
- Oh, I'm mad.

00:00:56,999 --> 00:01:00,551
What does the fastest man
alive do on his day off?

25
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:03,387
Before the lightning bolt, if I
wasn't still at the crime lab,

26
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:05,289
I'd be at home chilling,

27
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,724
but now my days off
are different.

28
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:08,309
Now they aren't so lonely.

29
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,945
The lightning
didn't just give me speed.

30
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,147
It also gave me friends.

31
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:16,200
This isn't even remotely
anatomically correct.

32
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,570
That's not the point,
Dr. Snow.

33
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,739
Then what is the point?

34
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:23,490
To have fun.

35
00:01:23,492 --> 00:01:25,876
And to continue your ongoing
training by testing the speed

36
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:30,314
of your mind by pushing
your ability to multitask.

37
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,720

I think we got something.

I guess we still have
a few things left to learn,

46
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:49,243
don't we, Mr. Allen?

00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,414
Armed robbery

St. Andrews--
seven blocks north, two east.

00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:38,042
Call the ER, tell them
they have an incoming GSW.

56
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:48,786
Let's go. I want
this locked up all the way

57
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,588
to the end of the block.

58
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,057
Tow truck was stolen.

59
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:55,025
Driver of the armored car
is in a stable condition

60
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,561
at St. Andrews, and no one's
exactly sure how he got there.

61
00:03:57,563 --> 00:03:59,229
Did you check
the security cameras?

62
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,781
Camera's storage drive
was stolen.

63
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,866
Guys are pros.

64
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,902
Everything's still here,

I think they were after,

66
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,489
the Kahndaq Dynasty diamond.

67
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:11,375
It was on its way to Central
City museum for exhibition.

68
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:14,294
Right, Iris is trying
to talk me into going.

69
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,713
I'm not much of a museum guy,

70
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:19,583
but when she really
wants to do something--

71
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:25,139
I'm just going to walk away now.

72
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,091
Sorry, Captain.
I was at the hospital

73
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:29,059
visiting a friend.
There's nothing missing.

74
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,095
It looks like someone
interrupted a robbery.

75
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:32,730
Guard says
there was three of them.

76
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:34,098
Actually, there was four.

77
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,516
I mean, that's
how many I would bring

78
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:37,935
if I were doing a robbery
of this nature.

79
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:39,987
That's definitely
a four guy truck.

80
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,606
A driver, two more
to cover the guards, and--

81
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:45,492
somebody used liquid nitrogen
to crack open this door,

82
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,111
so four bad guys.

83
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:51,331
Thank you, Mr. Allen,
for your brilliant insight.

84
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,866
For somebody so fast,

85
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:54,618
you're a little slow
on the improvising.

86
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,453
Did you see anything that could
help us catch these guys?

87
00:04:56,455 --> 00:05:01,842
Yeah,
one of them lost his mask.

88
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:06,497
I saw his face.

89
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,133
So look through these mug shots
of Central City's most wanted,

90
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:10,851
and see if you can find our guy.

91
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,469
That's him.

92
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:13,804
Damn.

93
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:15,305
Leonard Snart.

94
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:17,357
Leonard? That's almost as bad
as Bartholomew.

95
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,026
Snart ain't sexy, either.

96
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,978
Snart's father was a cop--

97
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,563
Was a bad cop.

98
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:24,815
Took his anger out on his kids
until he went to prison.

99
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:26,817
Snart's dad's in prison too?

100
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:28,285
We should start a club.

101
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,154
He shows up, like,
every six months.

102
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:32,906
He cases a job for weeks
before he makes his move.

103
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:35,125
Then,
he does the job--gets away.

104
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,411
That's before the streak
was around.

105
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:39,663
Did you just refer to yourself
in the third person?

106
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:41,999
I referred to the streak,
which I'm pretty sure I can top.

107
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:43,250
I've been thinking
of a new name.

108
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:44,585

about the Fla--

109
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:46,220

110
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:47,504

111
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:49,089

at me every since I told him

00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,231
about me and Eddie.

115
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,982
No, you mean he's mad at you
because you didn't tell him.

116
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,902
Uh, first, that sounds
like you're taking his side,

117
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,437
and second, do you know
how he does this whole,

118
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,155
“I'm not talking to you,
but I have a whole bag

119
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,024
full of judgmental looks
I'm gonna try out on you later”.

120
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:08,559
Yeah, I've been
on the receiving end

121
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:10,027
of those a few times.

122
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,662
Speaking of communications,

123
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:13,947
or lack thereof, after all
of these journalism classes,

124
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,666
I got an idea.
Huh.

125
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,334
I started a blog.

126
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,203
All right, what's it about?
Your brownie obsession?

127
00:06:19,205 --> 00:06:20,537
'Cause, you know, you probably
shouldn't broadcast that.

128
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:22,206
No, something important.

129
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:26,877
Something that Central City
needs to know about, the streak.

130
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,462
He's out there, Barry.

131
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:31,682
Rumor has it, he stopped
an armed car robbery earlier.

132
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:33,550
I was hoping that I could take
a look at the file, and--

133
00:06:33,552 --> 00:06:35,185
What?
I'm not at liberty

134
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:38,105
to discuss an ongoing police
investigation with you.

135
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,390

00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:51,118
All right, well,
anonymous or not, it's not safe.

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,070
You never know what kind
of weirdos are out there

143
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:54,321

144
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:55,956
I can vouch for that.

145
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:59,743
The Internet is full of weirdos
and nerd rage...

146
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,545
lots and lots of nerd rage.

[Chuckles]

148
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,134
Hi.
Felicity Smoak.

149
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,919
Iris West.

150
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:10,888
Barry Allen.

151
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,006
But you both already knew that.
Felicity is--

152
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:14,424
The girl that you met in
Starling City,

153
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:16,510
the computerer, right?

154
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:19,062
You two worked on one
of Barry's unexplainable cases.

155
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,800
Which, long story short,
was definitely explainable.

156
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:27,888
So the lightning
came through here?

157
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,558
Yeah.

158
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:36,480
There's been some rumors
the last few weeks.

159
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:39,533
People seen a red blur
tearing through the streets.

160
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,151
What the hell is it, man?

161
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:42,536
Maybe it was a drone.

162
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:45,822
Some top secret army thing.

163
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,994
When I was a kid,
my grandfather used to

164
00:07:50,996 --> 00:07:54,631
take my sister and me
to this diner, the Motorcar.

165
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:57,801
Food was for crap,
but the view was great,

166
00:07:57,803 --> 00:08:01,138
right across from
the Central City precinct.

167
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,590
I still go there.
I listen to their radios.

168
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:06,310
I learn their response times.

169
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:08,145
There are 40 banks
in Central City,

170
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:10,931
each of them within 60 seconds
of police response.

171
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:15,018
That's the advantage
of hitting a moving target.

172
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,937
Once the armored car called 911,

173
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:21,024
we had 182 seconds before
any cop could be on the scene.

174
00:08:21,026 --> 00:08:25,279
No one could have gotten there
fast enough to stop us.

175

need something, or--

No, no, I came
because I wanted to see you.

out of the coma.

you two talking

talking about something else,

Okay.

about him is sped up,

if he ran too fast?

00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:41,928
I mean, would he just
be running, and then, poof,

273
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,015

No?

a few beers after work?

00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:58,091
but never judge a book
by its cover, you know?

351
00:15:58,093 --> 00:16:01,127
Fires highly concentrated,
combustible liquid fuel

352
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,262
that ignites on contact
with the air.

353
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:05,298
I don't need
to heat things up.

354
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,519
I need to slow them down.

355
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,687
That's the one, then.

356
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,472
You were drawn right to it.

357
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:15,975
Stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs
after the incident,

358
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:17,860
and with nothing
but a skeleton security crew

359
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:20,196
to guard the tech inside.

I'm not sure what it is.

00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,703
Like a white flame,
but it's not hot, it's cold.

362
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:28,237
Glasses look like they're made
of the same tech.

363
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,822
What are they for?

364
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:32,909
The glare.
You'll see.

365
00:16:32,911 --> 00:16:35,244
Who else knows you took this?

366
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:37,246
Just us.

367
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:40,550
No, just me.

368
00:16:40,552 --> 00:16:42,552
Sorry, pal.

369
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,176
Party people,

370
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,444
who's ready to
get their trivia on?

371
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:57,212
[Applause and cheering]

372
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,364
Okay, everybody, welcome.
We've got some new challengers.

373
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:04,335
Please, welcome e=MC Hammer.

374
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:07,422
No, you see, I did it
because e=mc squared

375
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:10,258
is Einstein's formula
for kinetic energy, right?

376
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,543
And, you know,
<i>can't touch this.</i>

377
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,462
That's great, Barry.

378
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,547
So where is Felicity?

379
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:17,882
I'm not sure.

380
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:20,051
I told her it started at--

381
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,556
Feel free to buy
yourself that dress.

382
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:30,395
[Laughs] I totally overdressed
for trivia night.

383
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:32,230
No, you look amazing.

384
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:35,233
Yeah, you do.

385
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:37,702
E=MC Hammer.

386
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:39,404
That's funny.

387
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:42,840
See?

388
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:45,076
It wasn't until 1852,

389
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:47,712
when the Transcontinental
railroad laid their tracks

390
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:49,414
through this thriving
cattle town,

391
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,833
that we became
officially incorporated.

392
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:55,386
That same year, the worst flood
this area's ever seen hit.

393
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:59,507
But from that disaster rose
Central City's greatest hero,

394
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:03,144
cattle rancher
Bobby “Bovine” McFeely.

395
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:07,265
Bovine McFeely saved 17 cows
from the great flood.

396
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:10,485
Hey, kid.
Gum?

397
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:20,695
And now, for the exhibit

398
00:18:20,697 --> 00:18:22,914
I'm sure you've all
come here to see,

399
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:26,918
the historic Kahndaq
Dynasty diamond.

400
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,503
Be careful.
Get too close

401
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:30,955
and you'll set off
the proximity alarms.

402
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:33,257
Wouldn't want to do that.

- Three is Pasteur.
- Mm-mm.

407
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,440
Three is Erdel,
and four is Pasteur.

408
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,809
- Right.
- Five?

409
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:52,877
Both: Descartes.

410
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,912
Are they even speaking
English?

411
00:18:54,914 --> 00:19:00,651
And the points
go to e=MC Hammer.

412
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:03,821
I knew you two
would make a good team.

413
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,656
So, Felicity, what do you do?

414
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:06,991
I work in computer sciences

415
00:19:06,993 --> 00:19:09,293
at Queen Consolidated.
Really?

416
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:12,797
Do you have a boyfriend
in Starling City?

417
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,551
No, no, there is no one.

418
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:17,885
I'll get us some more drinks.

419
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,504
And I had too many
of those first ones,

420
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,672
so I will be right back.

421
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,516
- What?
- Dude.

422
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:33,484
Dude? Wha--

423
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:35,903
Are you still gonna tell me
that she's not into you?

424
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:37,939
Look at that dress.

425
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:39,524
And when I asked her
the boyfriend question,

426
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,025
she froze.

427
00:19:41,027 --> 00:19:43,411
Yeah, you were
particularly sly with that one.

428
00:19:43,413 --> 00:19:46,948
Felicity is smart, nice,
and pretty.

429
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,167
And most importantly,
she is the first girl

430
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:51,753
that I have seen you with
that really understands

431
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:53,788
and appreciates you
for the amazing person

432
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,541
that I am always
telling you that you are.

433
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,143
She's perfect for you,

434
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:02,380
so what are you waiting for,
Barry?

435
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:06,968
How long has it been missing?

436
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,688
I don't know.

437
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,691
I'm gonna ask you again,
Cisco.

438
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,443
But when I do,

439
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:18,446
I expect a more specific answer
than “I don't know.”

440
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:23,901
Now, how long has this weapon
been gone?

441
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:26,571
A day, maybe two.

442
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:29,490
One of the janitors didn't
show up for work this morning.

443
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:31,459
He was probably the one
who took it.

444
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:35,079
I didn't think that--

445
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:36,714
You didn't think,

446
00:20:36,716 --> 00:20:40,084
because if you had, you would
have discussed with me

447
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:41,469
first your desire to build
something that could,

448
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,587
in theory, hurt anyone,

449

and in particular,
Barry Allen.

450
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:47,892
I'm sorry.

451
00:20:47,894 --> 00:20:49,894
If you just let me explain--

452
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:51,679
You know how I feel
about weapons, Cisco.

453
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,431
They do not belong
in S.T.A.R. Labs.

454
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:57,685
Now, you are gonna figure out
a way to locate this gun,

455
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:01,105
and you are gonna
do it right now.

456
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,364
This thing you built,
what can it do?

457
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,703
Bad stuff.

458
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,456
You said to call if
there was anything suspicious.

No, I mean,
maybe they'll get it wrong too.

Oh, yeah.
I am sure that the team

doesn't know the name

Snart didn't even bother
to finish high school,

Why?

520
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:08,618
Because speed
and cold are opposites.

Temperature is measured

by how quickly the atoms
of something are oscillating.

The faster they are,
the hotter it is,

524
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,909
and when then are cold, they're
slower on the atomic level.

Absolute zero.

527
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:23,382
Yeah.

528
00:25:23,384 --> 00:25:29,055
I designed a compact cryo engine
to achieve absolute zero.

529
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:31,257
I built it to stop you.

530
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,427
I didn't know
who you were then, Barry.

531
00:25:34,429 --> 00:25:37,179
I mean, what if you turned out
to be some psycho,

532
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:38,431
like Mardon or Nimbus?

533
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,983
But I didn't.
Did I?

534
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:44,987
We built the entire structure
you're standing in to do good,

535
00:25:44,989 --> 00:25:46,439
and it blew up.

536
00:25:46,441 --> 00:25:48,691
In the wake of that,
you can understand why Cisco

537
00:25:48,693 --> 00:25:50,493
would want
to be prepared for the worst.

538
00:25:50,495 --> 00:25:52,778
I can understand that,
but what I can't understand

539
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,665
is why you didn't tell me
what you did.

540
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:57,199
I mean,
after all we've been through,

541
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,584
I thought you trusted me.

542
00:25:58,586 --> 00:26:00,620
I thought we were friends.
We are, Barry.

543
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:02,455
I mean, if you
would have just told me,

544
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:04,290
I could have been prepared.

545
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,509
But instead,
someone died tonight.

546
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:11,464
And I have to live with that.

547
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:15,635
No, Cisco. We all do.

548
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:22,308
[On television]
Theatergoers remain shaken

549
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,477
after surviving tonight's
brutal and bizarre attack

550
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:25,479
in a downtown theater...

551
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,531
The news--are you okay?

552
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:31,367
I'm fine.

553
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:33,536
How long is this gonna go on?

554
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:36,205
Seems like the cold treatment
is going around.

555
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,657
Not now, Iris, please.

556
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,792
Yes, now.

557
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:41,577
You did the same thing
when I tried to sign up

558
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:43,496
for the Police Academy
without telling you.

559
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,331
You didn't speak to me
for weeks--

560
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,300
not until I withdrew
my application.

561
00:26:47,302 --> 00:26:49,835
Well, I am not withdrawing
this time, Dad.

562
00:26:49,837 --> 00:26:52,254
I am dating Eddie
whether you like it or not.

563
00:26:52,256 --> 00:26:54,056
- Eddie's my partner.
- I know.

564
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:55,641
But you don't.
You're not a cop.

565
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,144
You don't know
what having a partner means.

566
00:26:58,146 --> 00:27:01,063
Wherever I go, he goes,

567
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:04,350
and where I go
isn't always safe, Iris.

568
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:07,987
I need to be 100% focused.

569
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:11,357
Now, there's a part
of me that isn't focused,

570
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,359
that doesn't see Eddie
as my partner,

571
00:27:13,361 --> 00:27:15,611
but as your boyfriend.

572
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:19,115
So if he gets hurt or worse,

573
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:21,117
and I'm there,

574
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,202
how am I gonna look at you?

575
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:26,288
How you gonna look at me?

576
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,008
Now, I'm not mad at you,

577
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,879
but that's
why this is so hard for me.

578
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:35,881
Do you understand?

579
00:27:39,771 --> 00:27:41,270
We're going back tonight.

580
00:27:41,272 --> 00:27:42,722
- Back where?
- To the museum.

581
00:27:42,724 --> 00:27:44,724
That diamond isn't going
to steal itself.

582
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:46,859
Super gun freeze
your brain, Snart?

583
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:48,728
The museum's gonna
be crawling with police by now,

584
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,563
and the Streak.
This can stop the Streak.

585
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:53,232
It hurt him,
and I know his real weakness.

586
00:27:53,234 --> 00:27:56,235
So we go, unless you want out.

587
00:27:56,237 --> 00:27:59,739
We both want out...alive.

588
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:02,625
So you thought ahead
and made a plan.

589
00:28:02,627 --> 00:28:06,295
Least I taught you something.

590
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:08,080
So what are you waiting for?

591
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:11,050
Shoot me.

592
00:28:11,052 --> 00:28:13,252
You better put a bullet
in my brain right now,

593
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:15,087
because if you don't,

594
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:17,673
if I ever see either one
of you again--

595
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:19,975
You don't get it, do you?

596
00:28:19,977 --> 00:28:22,311
This blur is out there,

597
00:28:22,313 --> 00:28:25,431
and Central City
ain't your playground anymore.

598
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:32,855
Sure, it is.

599
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:42,281
Barry?

600
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:45,584
Barry.

601
00:28:45,586 --> 00:28:48,537
What?
What are you doing?

602
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,823
You should go back
to your hotel.

603
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:53,342
Get some sleep.
You should too.

604
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:56,595
Not go back to my hotel--
I meant get some sleep.

605
00:29:00,485 --> 00:29:02,218
I can't.

606
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,687
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that man's face.

607
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:10,392
I watched him die.

608
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,698
I have to go faster.

609
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,567
Barry, it's not your fault.

610
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:20,152
And it's not Cisco's, either.

611
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:21,654
Barry, I know you're upset,

612
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:25,124
but you have to look at this
from his point of view.

613
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:27,042
No, I get it.

614
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:28,744
He didn't trust me.

615
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,831
Barry, when you met us--
me, Oliver, and Dig--

616
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:34,834
we were this well-oiled
archery machine.

617
00:29:34,836 --> 00:29:37,136
But it didn't start out
that way.

618
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:39,338
And unlike you guys, we weren't
tossed together overnight.

619
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,424
We came together one at a time.

620
00:29:42,426 --> 00:29:44,176
Believe me, it took much more
than watching Oliver

621
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:46,929
do the salmon ladder
to make me trust him.

622
00:29:49,183 --> 00:29:51,350
[Scoffs]

623
00:29:58,993 --> 00:30:04,580
I've seen firsthand
what this life can do to people.

624
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,532
It's a lonely path.

625
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:10,369
Don't make it
any lonelier than it has to be.

626
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,950
Freeze!

627
00:30:25,265 --> 00:30:27,432
You want to end up
like that door?

628
00:30:35,158 --> 00:30:37,776
Hi there.

629
00:30:39,613 --> 00:30:41,780
I figured out a way
to track Captain Cold.

630
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:43,648
You gotta stop
naming these guys.

631
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:47,118
- Barry, listen to him.
- How?

632
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,255
The cold gun is powered
by an engine control unit,

633
00:30:50,257 --> 00:30:52,674
a microcomputer that regulates
air-to-fuel ratios

634
00:30:52,676 --> 00:30:53,959
so the sub-cooled fluid

635
00:30:53,961 --> 00:30:56,011
in the chambers don't overflow
and--

636
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:57,762
- Explode.
- Right.

637
00:30:57,764 --> 00:31:01,132
This E.C.U. was receiving updates
wirelessly from my tablet.

638
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:03,969
If I boost the signal
using Central City's network

639
00:31:03,971 --> 00:31:05,270
and send a false update,

640
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:06,688
we'll get a ping back,
and then--

641
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,274
We can locate Snart.

642
00:31:09,276 --> 00:31:10,775
How long will it take?

643
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:12,444
First I have to hack
into the city's network,

644
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:14,412
so I don't know, 30 minutes,
maybe?

645
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,114
I can do it in less than one.

646
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:18,116
When it comes to hacking,
I'm the fastest woman alive.

647
00:31:18,118 --> 00:31:21,820
Ow! That was not as bad ass
as I pictured.

648
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:25,490
All right, I'm in.

649
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:26,825
Are you kidding?

650
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:29,628
All right,
I'm sending the updates.

651
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,962
We're connected.

652
00:31:30,964 --> 00:31:32,998
Network is triangulating
the location.

653
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,250
We got him.
He's heading west on Nelson

654
00:31:35,252 --> 00:31:37,002
toward the train station.

655
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:39,554
If he's leaving, it appears
Mr. Snart may have gotten

656
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:42,507
what he came for.

657
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,259
When we put our minds to it,

658
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:46,678
dude, nothing can stop us.

659
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Oh, you turned your ear
piece off.

660
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:50,849
How are we gonna talk
to each other?

661
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:53,351
I don't feel
like talking right now.

662
00:31:58,608 --> 00:32:00,275
[Over radio]
All available units,

Central City train station.

664
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:05,413
We got Snart.

665
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:08,199
- Wait here for back up.
- Wait for back up? No way.

666
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:09,918
That's an order.

667
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:15,256
- You should go after Barry.
- You heard him, Felicity.

668
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:16,708
He wants to do this alone.

669
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,093
Of course, he said that.

670
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:19,344
He's hurt.

671
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:21,046
You're his team and his friends.

672
00:32:21,048 --> 00:32:23,381
If I had a nickel for every time
the Arrow told me to back off,

673
00:32:23,383 --> 00:32:25,350
I would be as rich
as Oliver Queen,

674
00:32:25,352 --> 00:32:28,269
who I mention because he's
the richest person I know,

675
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:29,771
or used to be.

676
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:32,307
The point is,

677
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:34,859
you have your partner's back

678
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:38,730
no matter what.

679
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:42,233
I have something
that might help.

680

681
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,130
I'm your partner,
not your assistant.

00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:16,267
I didn't see you before.

Your mom know you're out
past your bedtime?

685
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:21,773
If you wanted to get away
you should've taken something

686
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:23,408
faster than a train.

687
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:26,161
That's if I wanted
to get away.

688
00:33:26,163 --> 00:33:29,114
I've seen your weakness
at the armored car,

689
00:33:29,116 --> 00:33:30,749
then at the theater.

00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:33,451
See, while you're busy
saving everybody,

691
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:36,004
I'll be saving myself.

00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:52,103
Good luck with that.

but not fast enough.

Thank you.

697
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:47,582
For what?

698
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:49,801
You forced me to up my game,

699
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:51,002
not only with this gun,

700
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:53,588
but with how I think
about the job.

701

00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:58,927
Drop it.
[Gun whirring]

703
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,645
This is a prototype cold gun,

704
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:05,350
four times the size,
four times the power.

705
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:07,485
I was wondering
who you were talking to.

706
00:35:07,487 --> 00:35:10,572
Hey, unless you want a taste
of your own medicine,

707
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:11,574
I'd back the hell up.

708
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:12,824
Your hands are shaking.

709
00:35:12,826 --> 00:35:14,509
You've never killed anyone.

710
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:17,495
There's a first time
for everything, Captain Cold.

711
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:21,366
I will shoot you.

712
00:35:25,505 --> 00:35:28,840
You win, kid.

713
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:31,092
I'll see you around.

714
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:37,849
Hey, leave the diamond.

715
00:35:37,851 --> 00:35:40,101
Don't push your luck.

716
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:46,558
[Machine powering down]

717
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,443
Couldn't shoot him
if I wanted to.

718
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:52,280
This is actually
the S.T.A.R. Labs vacuum cleaner

719
00:35:52,282 --> 00:35:54,032
with a lot of L.E.D.s.

720
00:35:54,034 --> 00:35:58,369
Let's get you warm.

721
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:00,371
Thank you.

722
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:12,717
We've been
trying to track Snart,

723
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,472
but he must have
disconnected the signal somehow.

724
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:22,393
We'll find him,
Cisco, together.

725
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:26,981
You have a great team here,
Barry.

726
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:32,487
Speaking of teams, I should
probably get back to mine.

727
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:35,273
It was nice meeting you,
Ms. Smoak.

728
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:37,909
Please extend a hello
to the Arrow for us.

729
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:40,161
I will.

730
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,833
Good-bye, Felicity.

731
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:48,870
Bye, Barry.

732
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,850
Remarkable young woman.

733
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,520
She's special.

734
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,972
Yeah, she is.

735
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:16,481
Cisco,

736
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:21,736
don't you ever
do anything like that again.

737
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:25,590
Do you understand me?

738
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:28,126
Yes, sir.

739
00:37:41,057 --> 00:37:43,641
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

740
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:50,315
If you're looking for Eddie,
he's in evidence.

741
00:37:50,317 --> 00:37:52,900
I am looking for you.

742
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:55,019
I came to apologize...again.

743
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:57,388
[Chuckles]

744
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,558
You're really trying to hit
that magic number, aren't you?

745
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,110
Look, Dad,
I just want you to know

746
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:05,396
that there is nothing
that you could do

747
00:38:05,398 --> 00:38:07,481
that would ever change the way
that I look at you.

748
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:09,116
And I'm sorry.

749
00:38:09,118 --> 00:38:10,651
I should have thought
about how

750
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:12,119
it would affect you
if Eddie and I--

751
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:14,138
Listen...

752
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,158
Chasing down
this Snart character tonight?

753
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,460
He had the draw on me.

754
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:23,247
Eddie saved my life.

755
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:26,083
Maybe I underestimated him.

756
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:29,887
From now on,
no more secrets.

757
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,394
No more secrets.

758
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:43,734
Well, go see Eddie.
Okay.

759
00:38:43,736 --> 00:38:46,771
Thank him for watching out
for your old man.

760
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:06,424
- [Yelps]
- [Laughs]

761
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:07,458
Did I just yelp?

762
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,010
- Yeah.
- I yelped.

763
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:10,711
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

764
00:39:10,713 --> 00:39:12,463
Don't tell me
you're here to save me.

765
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,785
Taking the train is still one
of the safest ways to travel.

766
00:39:15,381 --> 00:39:17,514
I thought that was airplanes.

767
00:39:17,516 --> 00:39:19,683
Mm...

768
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:25,186
You remember when you told me
you had a little experience

769
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:27,653
liking somebody
who didn't see you the same way?

770
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:31,657
That was Iris, right?

771
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:35,994
How did you know?

772
00:39:35,996 --> 00:39:38,363
It's the little things.

773
00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:41,533
The way you linger on her
when she isn't looking,

774
00:39:41,535 --> 00:39:45,204
the smile you fake
to play the part,

775
00:39:45,206 --> 00:39:48,040
quiet dreams
you keep to yourself.

776
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:54,513
Like you and Oliver.

777
00:39:54,515 --> 00:39:56,465
Takes one to know one.

778
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:04,773
I'm afraid
it'll change everything.

779
00:40:04,775 --> 00:40:07,526
It will,

780
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:10,195
but maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

781
00:40:13,534 --> 00:40:14,783
What is wrong with us?

782
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:18,070
We are perfectly perfect
for each other.

783
00:40:18,072 --> 00:40:22,124
Yet we're sitting here,
pining for people we can't have.

784
00:40:22,126 --> 00:40:24,977
I guess what they say is true.

785
00:40:24,979 --> 00:40:26,995
Opposites do attract.

786
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:33,051
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

787
00:40:33,053 --> 00:40:34,553
Same.

788
00:40:34,555 --> 00:40:36,088
Well, as fast I can run,

789
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,924
which might take me a while,
but I will still come.

790
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,600
Bye, Felicity.

791
00:41:08,505 --> 00:41:10,872
Bye, Barry.

792
00:41:10,874 --> 00:41:12,758
Whoo-hoo!

793
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:22,718
I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

794
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,470
I know it didn't go so well
for you,

795
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:27,189
and I know I said
we were finished.

796
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:28,807
But things have changed.

797
00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:30,609
If I want to keep
working in Central City,

798
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:33,312
I'm gonna need
a new kind of crew.

799
00:41:33,314 --> 00:41:35,447
I'm gonna need someone like you.

800
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,482
You're tolerant of extremes.

801
00:41:37,484 --> 00:41:40,068
You have certain skills.

802
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:44,406
You just need some direction.

803
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:47,626
And I can give that to you.

804
00:41:47,628 --> 00:41:50,212
You still like playing
with fire?

805
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:53,048
You're gonna love this.

806
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,833
So...

807
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:58,303
Are you in,
Mick, or are you out?

808
00:41:58,305 --> 00:41:59,588
[Chuckles]

809
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,541
Yeah, buddy.
I'm in.
