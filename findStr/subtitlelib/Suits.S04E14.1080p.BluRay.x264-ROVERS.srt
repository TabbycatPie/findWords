(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,846
GERARD: So I sign this
and the bribery allegations are gone?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,485
And no one ever knows a thing.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,126
You never let me tell you
what the money was for.

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,368
You didn't listen to me
when I told you I don't care.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,209
Well, do you care that
after Mike grilled me,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,051
I was so impressed with him
that I wondered why I had forgotten him.

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,643
But I couldn't find any record of him
ever being in my class.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,728
Just like they're not
gonna find any record

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,763
of you accepting
a bribe from a student.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,400
Jessica,
your secret is safe with me.

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,524
JESSICA: I told him you found out

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,927
that I covered up
Daniel Hardman's embezzlement.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,402
And now, you want me to protect
another one of your secrets.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,682
It's the same secret, Louis.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,121
And you have just
as much invested in it as I do.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,810
You want me to kiss the ring, Louis,
after what you did?

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,251
You're damn right I do.

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,124
Because I don't care
how it got up there.

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,562
My name is on that wall
whether you like it or not.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,847
. HEY-
. HEY-

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,008
What do you think of this tie?

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,961
I think...
I want to tie you up with it.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,248
Really? And what brought that on?

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,045
I don't know, I'm feeling powerful.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,450
Okay, well, then let's make

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,801
that happen.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,401
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,810
Is this to do things to me
or just to get control of the remote?

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,445
- Why can't it be both?
- Rachel...

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,042
If you think I'm gonna
let you watch Game of Thrones

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,486
while sexually dominating me,

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,490
then you... Are absolutely right.

34
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,487
(mum-nus)

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,161
Seriously, what's got you
feeling so good?

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,930
Oh, it just feels like such a weight off

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,769
- now that Louis doesn't...
- Despise me?

38
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,802
Mmm-hmm.

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,649
Ah, you know what else
would feel like a weight off?

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,765
(mum-nus)
(PHONE RINGS)

41
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,647
- Oh...
- No. No, no, no.

42
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,410
Nobody ever calls
the landline except my parents.

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,840
- What if something's wrong?
- It's fine.

44
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,281
- Mike.
- Okay, okay, okay.

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,048
Hello.

46
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,489
Yeah, this is him.

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,601
(noun-nus)

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,362
Yeah, of course
I can come meet you.

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,888
Can I ask what this is... Hello?

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,651
- Who was it?
- Professor Gerard.

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,525
- He wants me to go meet him.
- Did he say what it was about?

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,051
No, he hung up.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,366
When does he want you
to meet him?

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,841
Right now.

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,926
- Professor Gerard.
- Thanks for coming.

56
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,283
I wouldn't have bothered you
if it wasn't important.

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,402
It's not a problem.
What can I help you with?

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,965
It's not me.

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,527
A former employee at Liberty Rail
reached out to me.

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,849
He claims he was fired because he
knows the real reason for the crash.

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,803
And what was the real reason?

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,081
He wouldn't tell me.

63
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,361
Well, what did he tell you?

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,642
Enough for me to know
it would be unethical

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,524
if somebody didn't look into this.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,129
But you can't, so you want me
to get Harvey to.

67
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,487
Well, you convinced him
to look into my case

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,806
when he didn't want to,
didn't you?

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,048
This is different.
We don't take cases like this.

70
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,725
Maybe.

71
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,964
But I believe a man
who can convince Harvey

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,923
to hire someone
who never went to law school

73
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,010
could convince him to make
an exception for this.

74
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,722
What?

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,364
He didn't tell you I know.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,641
- No, he didn't.
- Well, I do.

77
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,524
But what I'm asking
you to do and me knowing

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,129
have nothing to do with each other.

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,725
I appreciate that.

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,968
Does that mean that you're gonna
tell him to take the case?

81
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,405
I have a better idea.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,490
Got a second?

83
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,762
Of course.
What do you need?

84
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,121
I'd like you to sign off
on my vacation request.

85
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,769
Paris-.

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,326
I've never heard you talk about Paris.

87
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,762
No, but I have heard you
talk about it,

88
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,609
which is why I'm taking you.

89
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,922
Are you asking me
to go to Paris with you?

90
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,721
- I believe I just did.
- Jeff, do you have any idea

91
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,001
how much is on my plate right now?

92
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,686
Actually, I do, all of which
Harvey has agreed to cover.

93
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,205
You went to Harvey with this.

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,405
Well, I would have come to you first,
but then it really wouldn't be a surprise.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,411
I'll think about it.

96
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,285
Take all the time you need.

97
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,961
But in the meantime,

98
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,651
I'll be thinking about
who else around here I can take.

99
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,610
Really?

100
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,444
Well, you're awfully sure of yourself.

101
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,366
You think I haven't seen
the way Norma looks at me?

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,891
Calls me the Black Stallion.

103
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,489
(WHISPERS) Norma.

104
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,921
- Taking a case.
- What kind of case?

105
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,326
What does it matter?

106
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,204
Because you wouldn't be
announcing it like that

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,691
if there wasn't something wrong.

108
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,451
It's a case that came
from Professor Gerard.

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,687
What?

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,040
A man who used to work at Liberty Rail

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,083
says the real cause of the crash
was covered up.

112
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,531
Then refer him to a firm

113
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,404
that takes whistle-blower cases,
because we don't.

114
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,847
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
- Then don't, but there's a reason

115
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440
lawyers who take whistle-blower cases
don't work here,

116
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,121
and it's because corporations
don't appreciate shakedown artists.

117
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,208
- And what if this isn't a shakedown?
- And how do you know it isn't?

118
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,850
What I know is that
innocent people died,

119
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
mothers and fathers
and sons and daughters.

120
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,841
And if somebody's
covering up why that happened

121
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,725
- and I can stop it, then I'm going to.
- And I said you're not.

122
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,969
Well, but you also said that Professor
Gerard didn't know my secret.

123
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,042
Harvey, I know, I know
he'll never tell anyone.

124
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,288
But someday, someone's
gonna find out who will,

125
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,488
- and I'll be done.
- Mike, he's not...

126
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,127
Harvey, I got into this whole thing
so that I could try to help people.

127
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,847
And I don't know
how much time I have left.

128
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,410
So please,

129
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,289
let me try and help these people.

130
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,921
Then you better make damn sure
this whistle-blower isn't full of shit.

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,808
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

132
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,129
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

133
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,449
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

134
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,803
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

135
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,129
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

136
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,847
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,081
All right!

138
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,684
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,843
The greenback boogie

140
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,841
Bonjour, madame.

141
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,088
Oh, I'm so glad you started
with that French bullshit,

142
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,884
because that's what
I want to talk to you about.

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,001
I know.

144
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,846
Never thought I'd have
someone ask my permission

145
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,882
to take you to Paris.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,968
You know damn well
that's not what Jeff did.

147
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,928
Jessica, what exactly
do you want to talk about?

148
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,327
I want to know
why you cleared my schedule.

149
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,686
Because Jeff asked me to,

150
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,803
and I can't remember
the last time you took a vacation.

151
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,524
When's the last time
you took a vacation?

152
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,369
I'm not the one in
a serious relationship.

153
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,846
Oh, so you're playing
matchmaker for me now?

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,967
Oh, I'm not playing anything,

155
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,730
and you were the one
who said you had to choose

156
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,571
between hiring him
and continuing to see him.

157
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,921
And then I changed my mind.

158
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,929
And I don't want you
to make the same mistake I did.

159
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,121
What are you talking about?

160
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,970
I should have taken
some time with Scottie.

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,884
Jeff and I are not you and Scottie.

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,844
Jessica, take a vacation.
Don't take a vacation.

163
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,086
The man came in here,

164
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,601
asking me for help because
he wants to go away with you,

165
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,610
and I said yes because I'm not
gonna be the reason he can't.

166
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,887
ELISE: Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

167
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,003
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

168
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,804
- Louis, do you have a minute?
- No, I don't.

169
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,324
Okay. What are you doing?

170
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,209
ELISE: Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

171
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,922
Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

172
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,326
You hear...

173
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,211
ELISE: Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call? Hello?

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,842
You hear that?

175
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,082
Where's the "Litt"? Every call is
like a slap in the face.

176
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,402
Louis, it's standard practice
for a law firm

177
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,806
to shorten their name
on the phone.

178
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,763
Sc blatant disrespect
is standard practice now?

179
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,211
It's not disrespect. It's just...

180
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,288
You're telling me
that your father doesn't

181
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,006
have them answer the phone,
"Rand, Kaldore, Zane"?

182
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
Actually, no, he doesn't,
and I think you'd agree that

183
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,926
people respect my father.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,321
Unless you want to go back
to telling me that he's a shady lawyer.

185
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,249
Come on, Rachel,
that was when I was mad at you.

186
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,448
Which is

187
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,686
actually why I wanted
to come and talk to you.

188
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,284
I want to thank you for forgiving Mike.
It... It means a lot to me.

189
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,290
Now, can you stop obsessing over
the phone long enough to hear that?

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,047
I'm sorry, Rachel, but I can't.

191
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,924
And now I have to go rip
that receptionist a new ass...

192
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,964
Louis, if one of your
first acts as name partner

193
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,082
is to rip the receptionist to shreds,

194
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,162
you'll regret that
for the rest of your life.

195
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,009
Just let it go.
(TAKES DEEP BREATH)

196
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,124
Let it go.
Things will run their course.

197
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,403
You know what, Rachel?
You're right.

198
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,849
And by the way, I'm glad
that we're friends again.

199
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,481
Good.

200
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,808
ELISE: Pearson Specter...

201
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,408
Harvey, what are you doing
at 3:30 this afternoon?

202
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,442
Why?

203
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,001
I have some news,
and I don't want you to overreact.

204
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,167
What is it?

205
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,924
Jeffrey Bender wants to meet with you.

206
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,290
He heard we're taking
a whistle-blower case,

207
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,925
and he wants us to drop it.

208
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,487
Relax, I'll take care of Jeffrey Bender.

209
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,447
Wait a second, you're not gonna try

210
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,483
to cut Mike's legs out from under him
before he even gets started?

211
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,442
What's the point?

212
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,847
He'd just bother me
until I agreed not to anyway.

213
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,442
I can't believe it.
You have no idea what to say.

214
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,049
What's the date today?
I want to write this down.

215
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,002
You know what?

216
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,964
It's the seventh of kiss my ass,

217
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,560
and tomorrow is the eighth of
set your own goddamn meetings.

218
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,241
Is that the Mayan calendar?

219
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,050
Nope, that's the Donna calendar.

220
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,562
I got you.
For the record, I got you.

221
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,567
All right, take me through it
one more time.

222
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,722
Well, it's simple.

223
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,003
There are axles
on all the cars in all the trains,

224
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,004
and those axles have sensors
to make sure they don't overheat.

225
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,851
So you're saying that the train crashed
because the heat sensors failed.

226
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,443
I'm saying that all the heat sensors
on the entire fleet were faulty,

227
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,926
and they knew about it.

228
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,042
Then why didn't you
come forward with this before?

229
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,083
You mean before they fired me
for coming forward with it?

230
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,440
Which brings me to my next question.

231
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,080
You've had four different jobs
in the last six years.

232
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,443
- What are you getting at?
- I want to know why.

233
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,040
I move around.
It's not uncommon in my business.

234
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,361
Move around or keep failing?

235
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,206
I got fired for blowing the whistle,
not for messing up on the job.

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,163
That's not what your last
performance review says.

237
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,080
I don't give a shit what it says.
They used that as an excuse to fire me.

238
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,410
And my reviews before I came forward
passed with flying colors.

239
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,567
I'm a solid worker.

240
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,451
- How the hell do you think I got this?
- I know your reviews are stellar.

241
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,449
What I need to know is
if there's anything out there

242
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,608
that we don't have,
because they are gonna come at us

243
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,481
any way they can, and when they do,
it's not gonna be about heat sensors.

244
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,687
It's gonna be about you.

245
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,320
Yeah, I don't care if
I'm the worst guy in the world.

246
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,247
I know I'm not the only guy
in that company

247
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,488
that knows those sensors are faulty.

248
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,649
What are you talking about?

249
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,325
HARVEY: What do you mean,
there's a report?

250
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,643
Done after the crash
that showed a defective part

251
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,202
- was the real cause, not engineer error.
- Says the whistle-blower.

252
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,845
Says these.

253
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,764
That's a memo ordering the report

254
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,008
and another email
acknowledging its existence.

255
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,761
We got 'em.

256
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,524
- We do.
- Set a meeting.

257
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,603
Let them do the talking,
then drop the hammer,

258
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,081
and stick a settlement down their throat
before they know what hit them.

259
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,804
I appreciate the advice, Harvey,

260
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,803
but this time I'm going in
with the hammer in my hand,

261
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,410
and I am coming out swinging.

262
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,249
Okay, big talker,
how much you asking for?

263
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,364
- 40 million.
- Are you kidding me?

264
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,204
They'll pay 10 times
that without even trying.

265
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,241
Not when I tell them they're gonna have
to admit what they did.

266
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,244
- Are you nuts?
- No, I am not.

267
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,890
We are not sealing this settlement.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,128
And before you say another word,
this is my case.

269
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,486
I don't care whose case it is.

270
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,204
They're never gonna admit
what they did.

271
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,209
Pick a higher number
and let them seal it.

272
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,209
Harvey, you told me
to prove this wasn't a shakedown.

273
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,527
Now you want me
to take money to cover things up?

274
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,290
You know what that is?
A shakedown!

275
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,085
A shakedown is when
your case has no merit.

276
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,486
This is the way things work.

277
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,931
Not to mention, if we quietly settle,

278
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,122
we don't have to worry about
scaring away our clients.

279
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,926
- That's why it's the way things work.
- Harvey, people died in this crash!

280
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,168
And they're not coming back,
no matter what Liberty Rail admits.

281
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,169
You are such a cold,
heartless son of a bitch.

282
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,964
And this isn't about your parents,

283
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,082
so back them
into whatever comer you want,

284
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,884
but when they refuse
to admit what they did,

285
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,566
you are not going to trial.

286
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,204
Stay out of my case.

287
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,608
Something smells delicious.

288
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,401
I'm making us dinner,
but it won't be ready for a while.

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,800
Good, that means we have time
to go over my proposed itinerary.

290
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,924
I don't recall saying yes.

291
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,804
I thought that we would start
with a private tour of the Rodin.

292
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,931
Oh, the Rodin.

293
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,249
God, I must have visited
that sculpture garden a dozen times.

294
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,170
Then I'm so glad that I arranged for us
to have a picnic while we're there.

295
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,164
And during that picnic,
we can reminisce about the week before,

296
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,005
where we danced the night away
in the Latin Quarter.

297
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,571
We did?

298
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,049
Mmm, or we'll talk about how we'll end
the trip in the Loire Valley,

299
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,045
where we will sip wine
along the Seine.

300
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,571
Jeff, this trip is perfect.
How did you know?

301
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,524
I know you've always loved Paris,
so I started there.

302
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,402
- And then I called your sister.
- You did that for me?

303
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,244
I did.

304
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,802
So what do you say?

305
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
I Say!

306
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,928
If you knew what I was cooking,
you'd already know my answer.

307
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,688
- Looks French.
- Mmm-hmm.

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,684
So you let me go through
all that even though

309
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,689
you knew you were gonna
say yes the entire time?

310
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,642
Mmm-hmm.

311
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,004
Aren't you glad I did?

312
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,887
Yes, Jessica.

313
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,008
Yes, I am.

314
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,727
Donna, what are you doing here?

315
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,645
I'm here because
I can't take it anymore.

316
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,841
What?

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,004
This place has no life,
and I can't take it anymore.

318
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,730
And that's gonna add life?

319
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,887
If I gave you something too needy,

320
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,088
it would intimidate you,
and you would let it die.

321
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,282
You expect me to believe
that's why you're really here?

322
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,371
Of course not.

323
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,086
I'm here to stop you from doing
what you're gonna do in an hour.

324
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,401
Crash Mike's meeting.

325
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,522
Donna, I can't have him
risking our other business.

326
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,404
It was one client, and you covered it.

327
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,807
And if he drags this to trial,
it'll be every client.

328
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,160
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

329
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,487
Then trust him
to accept that on his own.

330
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,886
- Donna...
- Harvey,

331
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,929
when are you gonna
let him be his own man?

332
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,889
His own man?
He's out of control.

333
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,008
He's identifying these people
with his parents.

334
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,771
And you're out of control because
you can't separate yourself from him.

335
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,325
Okay, you need to stay out of it.

336
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,408
And I will. But you said
you made a mistake

337
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,568
not trusting Mike
with Gillie Industries.

338
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,682
I'm telling you,
don't make that mistake again.

339
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,087
(PHONE RINGING)

340
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,086
ELISE: Pearson Specter,
how may I direct your call?

341
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,128
Uh...

342
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,645
(PHONE RINGING)

343
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,489
RECEPTIONIST:
Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

344
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,204
LOUIS: Son of a bitch!

345
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,687
Hello, liar.

346
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,442
- Excuse me?
- Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

347
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,766
You know what that is?

348
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,486
That's how they answer the
phone at Rand, Kaldore, Zane.

349
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,204
- Louis, I'm sorry.
- Oh, save your sorrys.

350
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,560
Do you know the receptionist
at the front desk?

351
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,210
Yes, her name is Elise.

352
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,163
Good, you can use her name
when you fire her.

353
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,166
I don't have the authority to fire people,
but I did just talk to her.

354
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,281
- You did?
- Mmm-hmm.

355
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,402
- To set her straight. That's good.
- No, not good.

356
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,800
She came to see me.

357
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,048
She said that
you've been harassing her.

358
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,841
What happened?

359
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,050
She said that you called and hung up
on her over 50 times.

360
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,605
What? How did she
even know it was me?

361
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,801
Because you called from your office.

362
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,570
Well, it wasn't harassment
because it wasn't sexual.

363
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,087
Well, she also said that
you were leering at her

364
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,402
- when you stepped off the elevator.
- I wasn't leering!

365
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,760
I was mad about how she answered
the phone.

366
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,446
Louis, it doesn't matter
why you did it. She felt violated.

367
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,767
Well, you know what?
You tell her it's not like that,

368
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,769
and then you violate
her ass out the door.

369
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,405
Louis, is this really the kind
of name partner you want to be?

370
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,090
No, I want to be
the kind of name partner

371
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,089
that has his name
said on the goddamn phone!

372
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,931
Okay, well, in order to fire her
without getting sued for harassment,

373
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,849
you'd have to fire
the entire support staff,

374
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,201
and you and I both know that
that's never going to happen.

375
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,322
We are not firing
all of our support staff.

376
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,209
Well, it's easy for you to say,
being that your name is first.

377
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,971
- So what are you talking...
- Jessica, I am talking about respect.

378
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,169
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,
find out what it means to me.

379
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,928
But I guess I'll just find my own way
to be treated how I deserve.

380
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,243
I know I'm gonna regret asking this.

381
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,443
Louis, tell me specifically
what it is you're talking about.

382
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,209
They are answering the phones
"Pearson Specter,"

383
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,210
- not "Pearson Specter Litt."
- Louis...

384
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,970
You don't believe me?
Check it yourself.

385
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,491
I'm not harassing our support staff.

386
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,726
It's not harassment, God damn it!

387
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,966
- Louis!
- Jessica,

388
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,647
it's like they've been specifically
instructed to leave my name off.

389
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,807
Now you're just being paranoid.

390
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,445
I am not paranoid.
They're in lockstep.

391
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,608
I'm telling you, someone paid them off.

392
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,688
Louis, that's insane,

393
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,561
but if you want them to say your name,
I will get them to say your name.

394
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,408
Jessica, what can I do for you?

395
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,761
You can explain to me
why you paid our reception staff

396
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,848
not to say Louis' name
when they answer the phone.

397
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,324
- Who says I did that?
- They do.

398
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,044
God damn it.

399
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,766
I paid them good money to keep Louis
from finding out for at least a month.

400
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,126
He hasn't found out.

401
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,248
It wasn't him who got them
to crack, it was me.

402
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,044
Even still, I'm asking for a refund.

403
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,441
Jeff, I'm serious about this.

404
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,200
I know you're pissed about
how he got his name on the door,

405
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,727
but I need you to bury the hatchet.

406
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,803
- Well, I'm not gonna do that.
- Why not?

407
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,809
Because every single time
I see his rat face,

408
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,160
I think about him blackmailing you,

409
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,806
and it makes me want to walk over to
him and rip his arms off his body.

410
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,242
And that little phone prank
was just my way

411
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,409
of keeping myself
from doing something like that.

412
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,330
I understand,
and I do appreciate it,

413
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,606
but I'm not asking you
to do it for him.

414
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,324
I'm asking you to do it for me.

415
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,128
Mr. Ross.

416
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,765
All I can say about
your filing is that I think

417
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,809
you might have a career
writing fiction.

418
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,883
And if you don't hand over
that report we're requesting,

419
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,769
you're gonna have
a career behind bars.

420
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,041
You're not here for that report.

421
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,561
You're here to strong arm
my client into a big fat check.

422
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,761
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

423
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,770
but a big fat check isn't
gonna get you out of this.

424
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,609
- Is that a fact?
- It sure as hell is,

425
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,929
because we both know that report
says you're responsible for this accident,

426
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,122
and we're not settling
anything without you admitting it.

427
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,208
And we're not admitting
something we didn't do.

428
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,001
What the hell is this?

429
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,771
Well, you wanted the report.
Here it is.

430
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,763
Your client wasn't lying
about its existence.

431
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,684
He was just lying
about everything else.

432
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,683
We ran repeated tests
on our heat sensors,

433
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,001
and they passed every one.

434
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,567
This is bullshit.

435
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,041
The only thing that's bullshit
is Joe Henderson.

436
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,448
He doesn't care about the accident.
All he's trying to do is shake us down,

437
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,171
exactly like he did at his last fourjobs.

438
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,610
- What the hell is that?
- His last four lawsuits.

439
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,846
Did you think we wouldn't
find out about them

440
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,644
just because the records
were sealed?

441
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,810
Mr. Ross, your client's been playing
the whistle-blower lottery for years.

442
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,685
He's never won before.
He's not going to win today.

443
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,164
You son of a bitch,
you tried to blow the whistle

444
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,164
at every job you've ever had,
and now they know it!

445
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,849
Keep your voice down.

446
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,723
Are you... No, I'll keep my voice down
when you stop bullshitting me.

447
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,888
Those claims were
supposed to be sealed.

448
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,003
I don't care what they were
supposed to be.

449
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,010
They found them, and you were
supposed to tell me about them.

450
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,963
And what would you
have done if I did?

451
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,161
I would've said what they said,

452
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,010
that you don't give a shit
about what they did!

453
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,645
You're just looking to get rich.

454
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,003
You think I would've risked my job
and everything that I have for nothing?

455
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,607
Excuse me?

456
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,609
I said, I don't see you

457
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,247
working out of the goodness
of your heart in your $1,000 suit.

458
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,643
You have no idea
who I am or why I do things.

459
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,724
And I told you, you don't have to be
concerned about my history

460
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,769
because what I'm telling you is true.

461
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,444
Well, not according to this.

462
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,722
That's the report that you said
gave us all the leverage

463
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,888
and they say proves them innocent.

464
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,650
That report is bullshit,

465
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,161
because I'm telling you,
those sensors didn't work,

466
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,970
and that was the cause
of that accident.

467
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,368
Well, I might have a leg to stand on
if you had any credibility at all.

468
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,130
How the hell am I supposed
to get a jury to believe you

469
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,884
when I'm not even sure I do?

470
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,445
What are you doing here?

471
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,608
I'm here to tell you
to call the front desk.

472
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,051
Oh, let me guess.

473
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,844
Jessica told you
they won't say my name

474
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,645
- and you thought it was hilarious.
- You're right, I did.

475
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,280
Why don't you get the hell out of my
office and go laugh somewhere else?

476
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,126
Oh, you want to hit me now?

477
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,402
Yeah, well, why don't you
go ask Mike Ross about my headlock?

478
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,931
'Cause it's a goddamn vice.

479
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,690
ELISE: Pearson Specter Litt,
how may I direct your call?

480
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,041
- It was you.
- Yes, it was me,

481
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,601
but I fixed it, so...

482
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,722
You can stop worrying
if everybody at the firm

483
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,650
respects you, because they do.

484
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,531
Everyone except you.

485
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,044
No, Louis, including me.

486
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,489
Listen, I may not like
how you got your name on the wall,

487
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,210
but that doesn't mean
it shouldn't be up there.

488
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,211
Congratulations, Louis.

489
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,007
Thanks, Jeff.

490
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,847
Hey, maybe we can even
get drinks this week.

491
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,650
- Name partner buys.
- Deal.

492
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,006
Done.

493
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,969
You can leave the coffee,
but I'm not getting up.

494
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,448
Mike, you've been working for seven
hours straight. You need a break.

495
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,369
I've been working for seven hours
because if I tell Harvey

496
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,966
what's going on before I have a fix,
he is gonna pull the plug.

497
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,003
Well, then maybe the plug
needs to be pulled.

498
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,805
Rachel, just because Joe Henderson is
a bullshit plaintiff doesn't mean

499
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,685
- they didn't cover things up.
- It doesn't mean that they did.

500
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,080
Okay, fine.

501
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,851
Why would he ask for that report
if he knew it would hurt our case?

502
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,565
- I don't know.
- I don't know either,

503
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,011
which is why I need more time.

504
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,043
Well, then you need to convince Harvey
to let you keep going,

505
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,764
because if you don't and he finds out...

506
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,245
He is not gonna find out.

507
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,169
Mike, he's not gonna find out from me,

508
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,527
but if I've learned one thing
in the last six months

509
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,690
of working here, it's that if he finds out
from somebody else,

510
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,404
you're gonna regret it.

511
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,530
You come here to tell me
you're taking that vacation?

512
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,290
I came by to ask
when Mike Ross started taking

513
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,289
- whistle-blower cases.
- Jessica...

514
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,006
I want you to put the brakes on him
before this gets out of control.

515
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,690
Well, I'm not gonna do that.

516
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,723
- Harvey.
- Jessica, it's one case.

517
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,002
He asked me to trust him,
and I'm gonna do it.

518
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,401
And if you're ever gonna
be able to enjoy a vacation,

519
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,005
you're gonna have to trust me.

520
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,127
All right. Good night.

521
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,689
Bon voyage.

522
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,322
You do know
that doesn't mean "good night."

523
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,282
Of course I do.

524
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,209
Do you know how to say
"good night" in French?

525
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,409
What, do you think
I'm some kind of Neanderthal?

526
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,328
You don't know one word
of French, do you?

527
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,644
- Ménage é trois.
- You're an idiot.

528
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,963
Ménage é quatre.

529
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,570
Ménage é cinq.

530
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,926
Can I come in?

531
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,484
What's going on?

532
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,927
- We have a problem.
- I'm listening.

533
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,530
Liberty Rail's report
directly contradicts our claim.

534
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,484
- That's a big damn problem.
- I believe my client, Harvey.

535
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,880
Based on what, your gut?

536
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,764
No, I found the guy
who wrote the report.

537
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,885
He's on indefinite leave in Australia,
where we can't subpoena him.

538
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,249
- So it's our word against theirs.
- Which is why I'm here.

539
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,723
Joe Henderson made four other
claims in the last six years.

540
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
- You're shitting me.
- Harvey...

541
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,361
That's it. I'm pulling the plug.

542
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,566
I knew it.

543
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,411
I knew you would bail on me the second
this thing hit the smallest bump.

544
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,842
Bail on you? I backed you
because you told me you had a case.

545
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,440
I do have a case.
I told you they got to this guy.

546
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,369
- And you got no proof of that.
- And if this were your case,

547
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,642
you would be begging me
for help to get it.

548
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,764
It's not my case. It's yours.
And now you're asking a jury

549
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,008
to believe these guys fabricated a report

550
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,282
based on the word
of a career whistle-blower.

551
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,529
- No, I'm asking you to believe it.
- It doesn't matter what I believe.

552
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,524
This guy is a goddamn shakedown artist,
and I'm pulling the plug.

553
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,247
I don't care what he is.
I'm not a goddamn shakedown artist!

554
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,406
- Mike...
- Harvey,

555
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,167
you told me that those people
weren't my parents,

556
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,964
but they are
somebody's parents.

557
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,411
Please.

558
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,446
You got 24 hours.

559
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,967
You know it's against the law
to litter, don't you?

560
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,726
- What do you want, Donna?
- I know you went to see Harvey.

561
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,571
- You know that he wants me to fail.
- That's not true.

562
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,489
I don't have anything,
and he only gave me a day.

563
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,080
And if he wanted you to fail, he wouldn't
have given you another second.

564
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,247
(SCOFFS)

565
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,761
You know he thinks
this is about my parents, right?

566
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,127
Is it?

567
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,689
Maybe it is,

568
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,808
but what these people did
is a million times worse

569
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,127
because they knew
it could happen.

570
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,730
Wait a second.
They knew this could happen,

571
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,887
and they didn't fix it before?

572
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,002
Yeah, Donna, and then they...
They rolled the dice.

573
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,201
Well, what about now?

574
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,407
Are those trains still messed up?

575
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,806
Because that would
make them monsters.

576
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,729
They are monsters,
but that would also make them idiots,

577
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,807
and they're not idiots.

578
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,967
Well, what are you talking about?

579
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,565
Well, they must have
fixed the sensors by now,

580
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,364
otherwise if it happened again,
they'd all go to jail.

581
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,005
Well, if they fixed the sensors,
then there has to be

582
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,167
- a paper trail.
- Of course there is.

583
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,805
Then all you have to do is get it.

584
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,889
What do you think I've been trying
to figure out all night?

585
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,929
What's to figure out?
Subpoena it.

586
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,930
Yeah, there's only one problem.
Harvey only gave me 24 hours.

587
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,520
But now that you've come up with this,
maybe Harvey will change his mind.

588
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,887
Donna, I have a theory that
I can't prove and an opposition

589
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,570
that's shown they're willing
to alter evidence.

590
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,648
He's not gonna change
his mind, and you know it.

591
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,004
There's got to be another way.

592
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,010
Donna, look, I appreciate
what you're doing,

593
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,010
but unless you have this other way
in your pocket, please,

594
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,648
just leave me alone and let me try
and think this thing through.

595
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,648
No! I don't care what he says.
It's an active goddamn investigation,

596
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,802
- and I'm not gonna stand around...
- You can't talk on that here.

597
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,001
Hang on a second, Charlie.

598
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,249
I'm sorry, we got off on the wrong foot.
ls your name Danielle?

599
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,285
That's what it says
on the plate, isn't it?

600
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,289
Well, Danielle, I'm here
to pick up the documents

601
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,522
I ordered an hour ago,
and if you don't give them to me

602
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,286
in the next 15 seconds,
today's gonna be your last day.

603
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,051
- You didn't talk to me.
- I said hold on, damn it.

604
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,409
Look, I don't have time
to play "who spoke to who."

605
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,801
lam up from DC because,
as it is, these documents

606
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,410
weren't sent when they were promised.

607
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,047
- I'm sorry. What is it you need again?
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

608
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,970
All the maintenance work orders
from the past six months.

609
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,003
I can't let you have that
without authorization.

610
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,088
Well, then by all means,
let's call your supervisor,

611
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,044
and we can tell him
how you'd rather play Farmville

612
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,321
than cooperate with me.

613
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,925
Who did you say you're with again?

614
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,447
Have you heard of the National
Transportation Safety Board?

615
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,165
They'll give you
what you need in the back.

616
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,201
(DOOR BUZZES)

617
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,847
What did you do?

618
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,249
- I didn't do anything.
- What did you do?

619
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,966
Don't give me that.
This makes my entire case.

620
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,321
But I can't use it if
I don't know where it came from.

621
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,403
Oh, that looks like
it came from Liberty Rail.

622
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,003
Oh, oh, yeah, it just happened to walk
itself over from their secure facility.

623
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,963
Well, it's possible that
somebody went over there

624
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,969
and released it
from their secure facility.

625
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,526
Donna, if I go to Harvey
with this and tell him

626
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,291
- what I know happened, he...
- You don't know. You think.

627
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,324
Don't lawyer me.
He'll never let me use it.

628
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,602
Well, then don't tell him
what you think happened,

629
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,848
because if you do,
he'll make you drop the case.

630
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,406
Okay, right now,
I don't care about the case.

631
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,165
- I care about you.
- Mike, I didn't steal anything.

632
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,329
I talked my way in,
and that's what happened.

633
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,681
Did you tell them this was discovery
for a case against them?

634
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,962
- No.
- Then it's not admissible in court.

635
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,761
Well, then you have to figure out a way
to use it not in court.

636
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,166
But don't ask me for my help on that.
I have done enough.

637
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,401
Hey.

638
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,205
Heard you wanted to see me.

639
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,247
I take it you patched
things up with Louis Litt.

640
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,327
How do you know?

641
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,206
Oh, he wanted to know if you were a
sports bar guy or a wine bar guy.

642
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,567
Did you tell him I'm more
of a strip club kind of guy?

643
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,842
You really want to go
to a strip club with Louis Litt?

644
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,843
I don't really want to go
to a strip club with anyone.

645
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,088
But I do have a meeting in 10 minutes,
and it's 15 minutes away.

646
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,281
Oh, I just wanted to tell you

647
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,880
that I appreciate you
patching things up with him.

648
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,530
There's no need to thank me.

649
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,648
I would do anything
for the woman that I love.

650
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,643
Even get a drink with Louis Litt.

651
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,121
(MIKE CLEARS THROAT)

652
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,168
You here to talk
about Anderton Software?

653
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,647
Because your 24-hour
Liberty Rail pass is up.

654
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,684
Then I guess it's a good thing
that just came in the mail for me.

655
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,802
- What is it?
- Maintenance records showing

656
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,684
they replaced the heat sensors
on all of their trains

657
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,326
within six weeks
after the derailment.

658
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,125
Now, why would they do that
if they never failed a safety test?

659
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,082
They wouldn't.

660
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,690
Which means Joe Henderson
was telling the truth.

661
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,406
I can think of three different ways
they'll explain this away.

662
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,126
Not if we can get them on record
before they know we have it.

663
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,251
And why don't they know we have it?

664
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,086
The same way I didn't know they got
Joe Henderson's sealed records.

665
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,611
Which means you did
something sketchy.

666
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,404
Harvey, do you want to spend all night

667
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,443
asking me exactly
what I did or did not do,

668
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,562
or do you want
to help me right a wrong?

669
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,884
Donna?

670
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,369
Set a deposition with Liberty Rail,

671
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,563
and tell them this time
it won't just be Mike.

672
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,926
I'm on it.

673
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,766
Who the hell is that?

674
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,524
That's the CEO of Liberty Rail.

675
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,728
Yeah, I know who he is.
Who is she?

676
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,251
That's their lawyer.

677
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,569
- Why didn't you tell me she was hot?
- Because it's not relevant.

678
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,165
- It is to me.
- Why?

679
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,361
Because she's hot.

680
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,048
You must be the infamous
Harvey Specter.

681
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,401
- You must be...
- Evan Smith.

682
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,329
Have to admit,
when I saw your name was Evan,

683
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,521
I thought you were a man.

684
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,005
And I have to admit,
when I saw your name was Harvey,

685
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,440
I thought you were a man.

686
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,722
- I think I'm in love.
- I think you are, too.

687
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,285
Okay, can we get this over with?

688
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,124
We sure can.

689
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,288
I don't even know how
you have any questions at all,

690
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,721
- given our last meeting.
- We just have a few.

691
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,251
MIKE: Mr. McIntyre,
before the derailment,

692
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,364
Liberty Rail conducted tests on
the heat sensors on its trains.

693
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,481
Is that correct?

694
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,051
- Of course we did.
- And why was that?

695
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,282
We run tests on all our systems.

696
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,726
It's routine.

697
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,251
And the finding of that report

698
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,408
is that there were no problems
with the heat sensors.

699
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,291
Are you going to just ask questions
that you already know the answers to?

700
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,561
It's routine.

701
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,290
There weren't any problems
with the sensors.

702
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,244
And do you routinely
replace the heat sensors?

703
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,966
Yes. We replace them
every five years

704
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,208
as part of our regularly
scheduled maintenance.

705
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,482
And when was the last regularly
scheduled maintenance?

706
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,522
That would be two years ago.

707
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,768
And you wouldn't fix something
that wasn't broken, right?

708
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,448
(CHUCKLES)
Of course not.

709
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,571
I'm not in the business
of wasting money, gentlemen.

710
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,569
I'm a bit confused.

711
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,121
If you're not in the business
of wasting money

712
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,446
and there was nothing wrong
with those sensors,

713
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,967
then why did you just
replace all of them?

714
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,531
They didn't replace all of them.

715
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,211
I think we'd like your client
to answer that question.

716
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,684
You're in a bit of a pickle, Richard.

717
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,529
You don't know whether to say
you did or you didn't.

718
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,130
Of course, you could roll
the dice with your own life

719
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,845
just like you did with other people's.

720
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,850
HARVEY: The truth is, it doesn't matter,
because you already said on camera

721
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,440
- you didn't replace those sensors.
- And we have these.

722
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,201
(SIGHS)

723
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,286
Where'd you get these?

724
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,768
I'll tell you what I told Joe Henderson.
It doesn't matter where they came from.

725
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,723
It just matters that they're here.

726
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,730
- I need to talk to my client.
- That's a good idea.

727
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,844
You should discuss how many zeros
you're gonna write on that check.

728
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,008
And one more thing.
You're not only gonna write a check.

729
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,243
You're gonna write a public admission
because people died in that crash.

730
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,451
- That's not how this works.
- It's how it works today.

731
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,802
MIKE: You're really gonna
force them to make a public admission?

732
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,887
Damn right, I am.

733
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,526
- Who are you, Mahatma Gandhi?
- Somebody has to be.

734
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,483
You were too busy
demanding a bunch of zeros.

735
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,570
Well, I was just looking out for you.
Those suits don't pay for themselves.

736
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,681
No, they don't.

737
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,929
Mike, great job.
You really stepped it up.

738
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,530
Thanks, Harvey.

739
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,007
I think you might be starting
to come into your own, too.

740
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,883
LOUIS: Really?
Every single game?

741
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,241
No, just the playoffs.

742
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,970
- Two sips?
- Two sips.

743
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,321
- No more, no less.
- Any beer?

744
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,967
Oh, no, not any beer.
Miller Lite.

745
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,330
Miller Lite? What?
But she's a queen.

746
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,408
What can I tell you?
She got it from her dad.

747
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,443
Look, if the Giants are in the playoffs

748
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,130
and Jessica doesn't take
two sips of Miller Lite

749
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,243
after every single first down,
she thinks they're gonna lose,

750
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,811
and there's no talking her out of it.

751
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,008
And those happen a lot, right?
First downs?

752
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,960
They sure do.

753
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,570
So what is she like
when she's drunk?

754
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,363
Well, that's a conversation
for another time.

755
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,723
Ooh. I so feel you, bro.

756
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,086
You know, I got to say, Louis,

757
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,681
I almost feel bad
about pulling that prank on you.

758
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,690
Don't feel bad.

759
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,731
- It was a pretty good prank.
- Okay.

760
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,762
One more?

761
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,087
Only if you tell me more
about what Jessica's like at home.

762
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,960
No, screw that, I want you to tell me

763
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,929
what she was like back
when it was Pearson Hardman.

764
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,525
Done!

765
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,721
(mum-nus)

766
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,927
. HEY-
. HEY-

767
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,962
You're heading out for the night?

768
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,605
In a few minutes.
Want to grab a drink?

769
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,687
Celebrate?

770
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,251
- I can't.
- Why not?

771
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,961
Not that it's any of your concern,
but I'm having drinks with Evan Smith.

772
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,129
- What? You got her number?
- No, she called me.

773
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,480
Oh, she asked for your number?

774
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,007
No, she didn't have to.
You gave it to her.

775
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,201
It was on that subpoena.

776
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,004
I know what's gonna
be on your subpoena.

777
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,407
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means.

778
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,760
Sure as hell do.

779
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,489
- You wanted to see me?
- I did.

780
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,568
I take it you heard about Liberty Rail.

781
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,841
- I did.
- See?

782
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,566
No harm, no foul,
no mass exodus of clients.

783
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,650
I'm glad.

784
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,206
What's on your mind, Jessica?
You don't seem...

785
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,601
I know you told Scottie
about Mike Ross.

786
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,567
- How'd you know?
- I didn't till just now.

787
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,324
- Jessica...
- I'm not mad.

788
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,841
I just want to know
what made you want to tell her.

789
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,325
What difference does that make?

790
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,841
Because I want to tell Jeff
the truth about Mike Ross, too.

791
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,450
What changed between now

792
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,562
and when you fed him
that Louis bullshit?

793
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,687
Nothing's changed.

794
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,169
I just don't want
to lie to him anymore.

795
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,484
He told you he loved you, didn't he?

796
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,767
When the hell did you start
figuring shit like that out?

797
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,887
- I didn't till just now.
- Then answer my question.

798
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,929
What made you decide to tell Scottie?

799
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,042
That's not what you really want to know.

800
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,163
What you want to know
is if I wish I'd told her sooner.

801
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,525
Do you?

802
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,525
Yes, I do.

803
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,365
Hey.

804
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,046
Hey, Rachel.
What can I do for you?

805
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,246
I just wanted to come by
and say thank you.

806
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,642
- For what?
- Oh, come on, Donna.

807
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,885
Mike told me you saved the day.

808
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,884
Oh, well, you know,

809
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,610
after I saved those kids
from that burning building,

810
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,449
I had a little extra time, so...

811
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,324
Well, then maybe you should
take the rest of the night off.

812
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,561
And why is that?

813
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,569
Because that's what
superheroes do.

814
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,126
Macallan 18.

815
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,891
You got great taste.

816
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,565
- Surprised I called?
- Like I said, you got great taste.

817
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,728
But let me be clear.
You want to talk settlement,

818
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,530
I can't do it without Mike Ross.

819
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,881
I'm definitely not here
to talk settlement.

820
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,288
Good, because there are things
I can do without him,

821
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,843
exceptionally.

822
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,528
- I want to show you a little video.
- What, did you dig up footage

823
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,968
from my high school championship?
Because that'll make this too easy.

824
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,450
Afraid not.

825
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,049
That's your secretary
unlawfully gathering evidence,

826
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,688
which means there will be
no settlement of any kind.

827
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,931
And tomorrow, I'm sending this
to the district attorney.

828
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,610
Enjoy your drink, handsome.

829
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,562
Jessica.

830
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,924
Jeff, there's something
I need to tell you.

831
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,605
There's something
I need to tell you, too.

832
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,447
What's going on?

833
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,888
What's going on is
I just had drinks with Louis,

834
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,843
you know, as a favor to you.

835
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,691
Turns out he's not so great
at holding his liquor.

836
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,926
- What did he do?
- No, he didn't do anything.

837
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,931
- You did.
- I don't...

838
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,246
You see, we were actually bonding

839
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,725
when I suddenly remembered
what he had done to you,

840
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,209
and I... Well, I wanted to make sure
that no one ever did that to you again.

841
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,449
So I asked him how he found out
about Daniel Hardman's embezzlement,

842
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,888
and he started with the words,
"it was two years ago."

843
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,971
- Jeff, I can explain.
- You can always explain,

844
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,969
but that just means your whole story

845
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,129
about how Louis got his name
on the door is bullshit!

846
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,083
And I came here to tell you the truth.

847
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,044
- More bullshit!
- Then let me tell you now.

848
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,161
Don't you get it? We're past that now.

849
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,884
- I don't want to know!
- Jeff...

850
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,968
In fact, I never really
wanted to know, I just...

851
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,925
I just wanted you to tell me.

852
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,567
But now, no matter what you tell me,
I won't ever believe it's the truth.

853
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,440
Jeff, let me in.

854
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,245
It's over, Jessica.

855
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,290
It's done.

856
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,486
We're done.
