1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,280
歌洛莉亚  亲爱的
Gloria, honey!

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,720
我随时都能出发
I'm ready whenever you are!

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,820
我们得快点了  预定时间是七点
We should hurry. The reservation's at 7:00.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,990
克莱尔  你在哪儿
Claire, where are you?

5
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:09,000
好  两分钟后见
Okay, see you in two.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,470
你在干什么呢
What are you doing?

7
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,810
我想摆个性感僚人的姿势给你妈看
I'm striking a seductive pose for your mother.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,110
真恶  不过我喜欢这套西装  新的吗
Gross. But I like the suit. Is that new?

9
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,930
是啊
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,410
爹爹的小心肝都开始挣钱了
Now that his honey gots her own money,

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,090
爹爹自然要给自己买套新衣裳  闺女
daddy went and snagged hisself some new threads, girl.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,350
这绝对是你最搞笑的声音
Hands down, your funniest voice.

13
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,840
快让人觉得恶心了
Bordering on the offensive.

14
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,410
你看  我是房地产经纪人
Listen, I'm a realtor,

15
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,530
得与很多家庭打交道
and I work a lot with families,

16
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,000
所以通常我不能表现得太性感
so normally, I dial the sexy back to five,

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,740
但克莱尔最近工作非常辛苦
but Claire's been working very hard lately.

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,200
所以今晚...
So tonight...

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,260
留下来看你们的妈妈
Stick around if you want to see

20
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,030
被我迷得口水直流吧
your mom's tongue fall out of her mouth.

21
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,400
还是算了  除非你想看我把午饭吐出来
Not unless you want to see my lunch fall out of mine.

22
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,580
抱歉我回来晚了
Oh, I'm sorry I am late.

23
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,230
路上实在是太堵了
Traffic was horrible.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,650
看起来有人急需一大杯水啊
Sounds like someone could use a tall drink of water.

25
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,670
是啊  对  水
Yeah, right. Water.

26
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,740
卢克  我是怎么跟你说
Luke, what did I tell you about

27
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,850
坐在椅子上向后仰的
leaning back on that thing?

28
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,140
不知道  是"不许这样"吗
I don't know. "Don't"?

29
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,300
亲爱的  你怎么还在这里
Honey, what are you still doing here?

30
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,670
你应该去照看乔了啊
You're supposed to be babysitting Joe.

31
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,920
是  但我得先载艾丽克斯去照看莉莉
Yeah, but I have to drop off Alex to watch Lily first,

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,990
但她还没准备好
and she's still not ready.

33
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,100
她不会是在穿衣打扮什么的吧
She can't be concerned about her looks, right?

34
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,750
-我听得见  -我开玩笑的
- I can hear you! - I'm kidding.

35
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,260
我只是想说
I'm just saying,

36
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,330
如果她还试图打扮就挺可悲的
it'd be sad to think she actually tries.

37
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,140
-又听到了  -开玩笑的啦
- Heard that, too! - It was a joke!

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,030
老天  大耳朵真的听得更清楚吗
Man, do big ears actually hear better?

39
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,790
我的天哪  别再说了
Oh, my God, just stop talking.

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,920
好了  姑娘们
Okay, girls.

41
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,350
你们该出发啦
It's time for you guys to hit the road.

42
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,900
好了  再见
Okay, bye.

43
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,970
-再见  -拜拜
- Oh, yeah, bye. - Bye.

44
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,190
你为什么不跟她们一起去
Why aren't you going with them?

45
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,140
他想待在家里
He wanted to stay home.

46
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,470
我同意了
I said it was okay.

47
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,150
-他自己吗  -没关系的
- By himself? - It's fine.

48
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,260
如果他能和我一起看《行尸走肉》
If he's old enough to watch "The Walking Dead" with me...

49
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,090
-他还不行  -他就可以
- He's not. - then he's old enough

50
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,830
-一个人待在家里了  -他还不行
- to stay home alone. - He's not.

51
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,510
克莱尔  他不是小孩子了
Claire, he's not a little boy anymore.

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,260
我没事
I'm fine.

53
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,890
你听他的声音多么低沉
See how deep his voice is?

54
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,350
你还好吗

是海莉的短信
Oh, this is Haley.

69
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,700
"五点到  艾丽克斯特么磨蹭死了"
"Be there in 5. Alex took ducking forever."

70
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,710
没关系  你知道吗
Oh, it's fine. You know what?

71
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,160
我们得选一张"预留时间"卡片
We have to pick the "Save the date" card.

72
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,970
我好纠结
I'm at a loss.

73
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,930
我们能明天再选吗
Can we just do it tomorrow?

74
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,680
我讨厌我们迟到时我爸看我们的眼神
I hate the way my dad looks at us when we're late,

75
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,180
就好像我们是两个傻基佬
like we're two silly queens

76
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,300
一边听迪斯科音乐
blasting disco music,

77
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,070
一边梳洗打扮  毫无时间观念
primping, losing track of time.

78
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,930
你这小脑瓜想象力真丰富
Wow, it gets really busy in that head, huh?

79
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,910
快点  你喜欢哪一张
Okay, quick. Which one do you like?

80
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,020
-那张  -真的吗
- Uh, that one. - Really?

81
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,990
我觉得你太草率了
I think you picked too quick.

82
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,380
不  没有  我真的很喜欢那张
No, I didn't. I really like that one.

83
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,480
我真的很喜欢这张
I really like this one.

84
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,350
那你特么为什么还要问我
Well, then, why did you ducking ask me?

85
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,180
好吧  听你的
Fine, goes with yours.

86
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,480
如果你真喜欢的话  就听你的
Well, if that's the one you really like.

87
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360
你能快点准备好吗
Can you just get ready?

88
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,660
行  莉莉  开始
Yeah. Lily, hit it.

89
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,600
遵命
On it!

90
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,170
快点  快点走啊  快点
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

91
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,940
我从没见你这么迫不及待要去一家餐厅
I've never seen you so excited about a restaurant.

92
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,230
这次预定我已经等了六周了
I've waited six weeks for this reservation.

93
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,070
那家餐厅有澳大利亚神户牛肉
They have an Australian Wagyu beef

94
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,620
简直会颠覆你的人生
that's supposed to change your life.

95
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,460
通过心脏病颠覆你的人生吗
In the way heart disease changes your life?

96
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,060
你真是健康的使者
Because you're a pillar of health.

97
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,890
这种牛只吃苜蓿  大麦和红酒
They only feed this cow alfalfa, barley, and red wine,

98
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,780
每块肉都经过厨师手工挑选
and some chef hand-picks each cut,

99
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,280
然后风干35天
dry ages it 35 days

100
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,250
才做成一道完美的三分熟牛排
before cooking it to a perfect medium-rare,

101
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,220
一切都是为我而做
all for me.

102
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,810
牛喝酒不会醉吗
Doesn't the wine make the cow drunk?

103
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,200
这不是在漫画里  牛又不用开车去哪里
It's not "The Far Dide." The cow doesn't drive anywhere.

104
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,470
歌洛莉亚
Gloria!

105
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,470
快点走了
Let's go!

106
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,570
你知道她不在这里吧
You know she's not here, right?

107
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,300
什么
What?

108
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,780
她在外面吹头发呢
She's having her hair blown out.

109
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,030
就这么个事儿
That's a thing?

110
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,700
要花钱去做吗
That I pay for?

111
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,170
歌洛莉亚总是迟到
Gloria's always late.

112
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,710
然后我就会生气  让她动作快点
Then I get mad and tell her to hurry.

113
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,350
我们会争吵  结果耽误了更多时间
We yell, and it just takes longer.

114
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,290
所以我暗中发誓  无论她多慢
So I promised myself, no matter how late she is,

115
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,540
我就深呼吸几下  保持镇定
just to take some deep breaths and stay calm.

116
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,760
这是我在无痛分娩课上学到的唯一一点
That's the only thing I learned in lamaze class

117
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,730
因为我们那时也总是迟到
because we were always late.

118
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,460
今天晚上大家都跟疯子似的
Hi! Everybody's running like crazy tonight.

119
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,500
我走了圣维森特路  以为会节省时间
I took San Vicente thinking that I was gonna save some time,

120
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,340
结果那里在修下水道
but then they're working on the sewer.

121
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,650
所以我绕道蒙大纳路
So I went around Montana,

122
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,810
又开到莫雷诺路上
down Moreno.

123
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,110
但是那条路上有个坑
But then there's that dip in the road.

124
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,870
我总是忘记路上有个坑
I always forget about that dip in the road.

125
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,910
车颠得太厉害  我把咖啡洒得到处都是
I hit it so hard that I spilled the coffee all over the car.

126
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,350
我跟你说我和谁去喝咖啡了吗
Did I tell you who I had coffee with?

127
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,150
我觉得卢克害怕被单独留在家里
I think Luke is scared to be left in the house alone,

128
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,610
他只是为了你表现得勇敢
and he's just pretending to be brave for you.

129
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,070
亲爱的  他都14岁了
Honey, he's 14.

130
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,090
艾丽克斯10岁时我们就让她一人在家了
We left Alex alone when she was 10.

131
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,990
不是"让"  而是把她忘在家里了
We didn't leave her. We forgot her.

132
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,950
我们赶回家时她不是好好的吗
And when we got home, she was fine.

133
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,050
身体上没事
Physically.

134
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,300
而且她和那个可爱的911接线员
Plus, she's still friends with

135
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,800
现在还是好朋友呢
that sweet 911 operator.

136
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,950
是啊
Yeah.

137
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,090
你在干什么
What are you doing?

138
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,080
确保卢克知道
Making sure Luke knows

139
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,400
发生意外时该怎么做
what to do in case of emergency.

140
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,040
他当然知道
Of course he does.

141
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,400
有人按门铃
Someone's at the door!

142
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,970
卢克  这是你妈妈在测试你
Luke, it's just your mom testing you.

143
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,100
别担心  妈
Don't worry, mom.

144
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,470
你们不在时如果我听到这声音
If I hear that while you're gone,

145
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,670
我不会开门的
I won't answer.

146
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,670
我就躲在没人能找到的地方
I'll just hide where no one can find me.

147
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,540
小卡  我们快走吧
Cam, come on, let's go.

148
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,640
再等两秒钟
Two seconds.

149
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,800
我还以为和男人在一起
I thought that being with a man

150
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,570
意味着我不必这样苦苦等待
meant that I wouldn't have to wait around like this.

151
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,180
我觉得受到了欺骗  真的
I feel cheated. I do.

152
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,380
我们来玩洋娃娃吧
Let's play dolls.

153
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,090
其实  我想给你读我最爱的一本书
Actually, I want to read you one of my favorite books.

154
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,040
书名是《小妇人》  讲的是四姐妹
It's called "Little Women," and it's about four sisters

155
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,190
克服贫困和父权制的故事...
who overcome poverty and the patriarchy...

156
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,380
不听  玩娃娃
Nope! Dolls.

157
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,380
这是阿什莉  她是个家庭主妇
This is Ashley. She's a wife.

158
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,350
希望她不只是个家庭主妇而已
Well, I hope that's not the only thing that defines her.

159
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,020
她有事业吗
Does she have a career?

160
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,440
不  她只购物  海莉在哪
Nope, she shops. Where's Haley?

161
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,400
我怎么五分钟就准备好了
How come it takes me five minutes to get ready,

162
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,520
而你还在磨磨蹭蹭呢
and you take forever?

163
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,230
拜托  我也能在五分钟内准备好
Oh, please. I could get ready in five minutes, too,

164
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,420
如果我穿得像...
if I dressed like --

165
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,310
你们又撞衫了
You did it again.

166
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,500
誓死不换
Not changing.

167
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,110
系好安全带
Fasten your seatbelts.

168
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,220
这会是个疯狂的夜晚
It's going to be a crazy night.

169
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,040
不  亲爱的  这会是个不太平的夜晚
No, honey, it's gonna be a bumpy night.

170
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,290
记住  你有两个爸爸
Remember, you can't have two dads

171
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,990
不能犯这种错误
and make that mistake.

172
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,380
不太平的夜晚
Bumpy night.

173
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,310
好吧  这种事多久发生一次
Okay, so how often does this happen?

174
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,320
太频繁
Too often.

175
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,040
男人没有太多选择
Men just don't have that many options.

176
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,500
简直数不清有多少次
I can't tell you the number of times

177
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,750
我经过女士服装店时
I've walked by a women's boutique

178
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,180
心里想"我愿付出一切
and just thought, "What I would do

179
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,580
来换取那么多的选择"
to have that many choices."

180
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,750
永远别这样说了
Don't ever say that again.

181
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,950
我一点也不喜欢
I don't like any part of it.

182
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,310
好吧  必须得有个人去换衣服
All right, one of us has to change.

183
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,620
我们看起来像教堂里的双胞胎小孩
We look like twin toddlers at church.

184
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,420
谁说不是啊
Yeah, tell me about it.

185
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,410
而且我们要去的地方很高端
And this place we're going is supposed to be super hip.

186
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,280
说不定会碰到熟人
We're probably gonna run into someone.

187
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,200
拜托  我没有你衣服多
And come on. I don't have that many outfits.

188
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,700
我的衣服只占了衣柜的四分之一
My clothes take up exactly one-quarter of the closet.

189
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,390
这样说可不公平  我的衣服比你大
That's not fair. My clothes are bigger than yours.

190
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,110
好吧  我不想打这张牌
All right, I hate to play this card,

191
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,100
但我先换好衣服的  所以
but I was dressed first. So...

192
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,590
真愚蠢
Oh, that is silly.

193
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,610
莉莉  该玩"谁穿上更好看"的游戏了
Lily, it's time to play "Who wore it best?"

194
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,820
不  我不玩了  我做不到
No, I'm not doing this again. I can't.

195
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,230
好吧  艾丽克斯你来
Fine. Alex.

196
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,460
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

197
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,380
男士衣服我不太懂
Boys' clothes aren't really my thing.

198
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,800
真的吗
Really?

199
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,160
我不明白
I don't get it.

200
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
牛喝了酒难道不会醉吗
Doesn't the wine get the cow drunk?

201
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,200
-谢谢你  -天啊
- Thank you. - Honest to God.

202
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,640
你俩都没见过牛吗
Have neither of you seen a cow?

203
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,320
它们体型庞大
They're huge.

204
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,760
我敢说龙舌兰酒会让它们醉得更快
I bet tequila would do it quicker.

205
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,890
目的不是为了让牛喝醉
It's not the goal to get the cow drunk.

206
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,730
没搞错吧
You got to be kidding me.

207
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,450
曼尼  去看看你妈怎么磨蹭那么久
Manny, see why your mother's taking so long.

208
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,770
别告诉她是我让你去的
And don't tell her I sent you.

209
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,880
妈  快点
Mom! Hurry!

210
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,280
别吼啊  我自己也能吼
Don't yell. I could have yelled.

211
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,910
-那你为什么不吼  -因为我不想吼
- Then why didn't you? - Because I didn't want to yell.

212
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,640
-我想让你过去  -你为什么不去
- I want you to go. - Why can't you go?

213
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,970
你怎么就不能乖乖听话呢
Why can't you do what I ask?

214
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,680
我在努力使用新方法
I'm trying to do something new here!

215
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,040
别吼了  杰  我准备好了
Stop yelling, Jay! I'm ready!

216
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,810
天啊
Oh, geez.

217
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,000
海莉  曼尼知道婴儿用的东西放在哪里
Haley, Manny knows where all the baby stuff is,

218
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,070
如果乔不肯睡觉
and if Joe won't go to bed,

219
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,990
就给他放格拉迪斯・奈特的歌曲
just put on Gladys Knight

220
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,090
然后轻轻摇晃他
and bounce him around a little bit.

221
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,110
你还这样做吗
Oh, you still do that?

222
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,550
我以前就很喜欢你摇晃我们
I loved when you did that with us.

223
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,100
怎么样
How about that?

224
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,610
这家里还有人记得我做过的好事
Somebody in this family remembers a nice thing I did.

225
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,120
我记得你做过的好事
I remember something nice you did.

226
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,370
你昨天上班时给我买了这条裙子
You bought me this dress yesterday when you were working.

227
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,270
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

228
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,650
美极了  我们走吧
Gorgeous. Let's go!

229
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,300
你都没看我  海莉
You didn't even look at me. Haley.

230
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,780
首先  你的发型看起来棒极了
Well, "A," your hair looks amazing,

231
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,260
就像是刚从马背上下来似的
like you just got off a horse.

232
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,920
那正是我想要的效果
That's exactly what I was going for.

233
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,980
不过我觉得吧...
But if I had one thought...

234
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,000
别  别觉得
No! No thoughts.

235
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,510
那对耳环不是最适合的
...are those for sure the best earrings?

236
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,000
感觉不是很显眼
They seem to be kind of getting lost.

237
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,780
我还有一副这个颜色大一号的
I have the same color in a bigger size.

238
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,160
-大多少  -一米左右
- How much bigger? - Like a meter.

239
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,430
一米都有一英尺长了
A meter? That's like a foot.

240
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,610
其实应该是一码才对
Actually, it's like a yard.

241
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,110
对不起  应该是一毫米左右
Oh, sorry -- it's like a millimeter.

242
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,000
你想说的是一厘米吧
You mean a centimeter.

243
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,840
数学真麻烦  给我看一下好了
All this math. Just show me.

244
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,840
-歌洛莉亚  -怎么的
- Gloria! - What?

245
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,840
我觉得那副新耳环
I think the new earrings

246
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,180
一定会和你的整套造型非常搭
are really gonna tie your whole outfit together.

247
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,760
你嘴真甜
You're so sweet!

248
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,770
你刚才的表现成熟多了
Wow. That was very mature of you.

249
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,280
是啊  我现在的确比
Yeah, well, I'm a lot older now

250
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,150
她开始打扮之前老多了
than when she started getting dressed.

251
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:35,850
所以这个声音
So this sound...

252
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,050
才是门铃声
...that's the doorbell.

253
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,310
之前那个声音是烟雾报警器
That other sound was the smoke alarm.

254
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,990
知道了
Got it.

255
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,940
如果你饿了  不要叫批萨外卖
Okay, and if you're hungry, don't order a pizza.

256
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,370
他们的配送员都没有经过筛选
They don't screen those delivery guys.

257
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,690
那些人多半都是有前科的
Half of them are ex-cons.

258
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,190
够了  你会吓到他的  不会有事的
Stop it. You're gonna scare him. It's gonna be fine.

259
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,680
不过万一你噎住了  你要这样
But if you do choke, you've gotta throw yourself

260
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,540
撞在椅子背上以便把食物吐出来
against the back of a chair to get the food out.

261
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,030
他喝点东西就行了
He'll just drink stuff.

262
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,220
不要拿水槽下面的东西喝
Nothing from under the sink.

263
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,590
连柠檬味的也不行吗
Even if it's lemony?

264
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,110
我跟你开玩笑的
I'm just messing with you.

265
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,910
要是着火  就俯下身子跑出去
In case of fire, go low and get out.

266
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,120
要是遇到地震
In case of earthquake --

267
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,700
等一下  你们觉得会发生地震吗
Wait. You think there could be an earthquake?

268
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,830
上次地震时  我被那个大柜子压住了
The last time we had one, that big cabinet fell on me.

269
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,150
-没有的事  -真的吗
- No, it didn't. - It did?!

270
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,870
我们走吧
Let's go.

271
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,760
再见  亲爱的  我们爱你
Bye, honey, we love you.

272
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
你有钥匙没
Do you have the keys?

273
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,130
我们会给你打电话的  我保证
We're gonna check in. I promise!

274
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,030
怎么回事
Uhh, what's going on?

275
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,160
新西服
New suit?

276
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,200
这个吗
This old thing?

277
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,410
是啊  是新的
Yes, it is.

278
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,600
我在市里潮人集散地买的
I got it at this hipster place downtown.

279
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:23,910
你喜欢吗
You like it?

280
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,620
有点儿紧
It's tight.

281
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,130
售货员说现在流行这种风格
Well, the salesman said it was the style,

282
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,260
他看上去像个蒙福之子乐队成员
and he looked like a Mumford and Son,

283
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,230
我以为他很了解时尚
so I think he'd know.

284
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,630
我们走吧
Mm, let's go.

285
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,700
慢一点  女飞人
Slow down, Flo Jo.

286
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,540
我们没有时间争论这些了
You know what? We don't have time for this.

287
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,320
我直接换衣服好了
I'll just change.

288
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,620
这让我好内疚  我们还是一起换了吧
Well, now I feel bad. Let's both just change.

289
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,770
这样做才公平
That's the fair thing to do.

290
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,090
好的  但是请你快一点
Okay, fine. But quickly, pLemony Snicketlease.

291
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,540
我不知道
I don't know.

292
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,810
这件是蓝色的
It's blue.

293
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,450
这件又太黄了
Yeah, this one's so yellow.

294
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,950
你猜怎么着
Oh, you know what?

295
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,310
这件衣服上有块污渍  我不能穿这件
I have a stain on this one. I can't wear it.

296
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,380
涡纹图案  不错  我不确定
Oh, paisley, yeah. I don't know.

297
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,900
你是在跟我开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me right now?!

298
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,170
-怎么了  -我知道你在耍什么把戏
- What? - I know this trick, Cam.

299
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,780
你永远也挑不出一套衣服
You take forever to pick out an outfit,

300
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,490
你知道我肯定会说"我们走吧"
knowing very well that I'll say, "Let's just go,"

301
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,340
因为我们已经迟了
because we're late.

302
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,230
这么一来  你做了提议换装的好人
Meantime, you get credit for offering to change

303
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,850
而我却是真正换装的那个人
while I'm the one who actually does.

304
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,960
-你一向如此  -你说什么
- As usual. - Excuse me.

305
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,490
你是在指责我操纵你按我的方式做事吗
Are you accusing me of manipulating you to get my way?

306
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,180
其实...
Actually...

307
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,720
因为我妈以前就是那么指责我的
Because that's what my mother used to accuse me of,

308
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,680
我不得不说
and I got to say

309
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,980
那让我想起了好多伤心事
that that brings up a lot of stuff with me.

310
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,600
你连滴眼泪都挤不出来
You're crying without tears.

311
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,010
给我点时间
Give me a minute.

312
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,380
"圣诞节要是没有礼物就不是圣诞节了"
"'Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,'

313
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,490
"乔抱怨道"
"Grumbled Jo.

314
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,860
"贫困真是可怕  她感叹着"
'it's so dreadful to be poor,' sighed --"

315
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,840
够了  我不爱听这个
Stop! I hate this.

316
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,020
我能给你化妆吗
Can I put makeup on you?

317
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,670
怎么总有人这么问我
Why does everyone ask me that?

318
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,450
我们今晚就高高兴兴地享受一下行吗
Let's just have a good time tonight, all right?

319
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,110
-我没生气  -好  很好
- I'm not mad. - Okay, good.

320
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,250
而且你穿那套衣服帅呆酷毙了
And you do look super-duper handsome in that.

321
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,140
别扯了
Don't even.

322
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,300
我去拿些水在路上喝
I'm gonna grab a water for the road.

323
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,260
给我拿罐汽水
Yeah, get me a soda.

324
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,870
好了  艾丽克斯  非常感谢你
Okay, Alex. Thank you so much.

325
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,000
晚上玩得开心点
Have a fun night.

326
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,260
宝贝  我们爱你
Honey, we love you.

327
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,080
-给你  -好的  谢谢
- Here you go. -All right. Thank you.

328
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,740
记住  不许在客厅里吃东西
Okay, and remember, no eating in the living room.

329
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,580
我的天  我的天
Aah! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

330
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,810
你做了什么  你做了什么
What did you do? What did you do?!

331
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,050
拜托  你不会以为...
Come on! You can't possibly think --

332
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,970
你摇晃这罐子来着
You shook this can

333
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,790
这样你就能穿这套我想穿的衣服了
so you could wear the outfit that I wanted to wear?

334
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,860
是的  我就是这么想的
That is exactly what I think!

335
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,600
这太荒谬了
That is insane.

336
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,910
你看着我把汽水从冰箱里
You saw me take it from the refrigerator

337
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,460
-拿出来给你的  -是吗
- and bring it to you. - Did I?

338
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,360
还是你趁我没注意
Or were you out of my sight for the two seconds

339
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,330
在从冰箱那里走过来的两秒钟里
that it took you to get from the refrigerator to here,

340
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,580
摇晃了这罐汽水  而两秒钟刚好足够
which would have given you exactly the right amount of time

341
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,670
用来摇晃汽水
to shake the can?

342
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,350
真棒  大神探  但我没那么小心眼
Nice theory, Nancy Grace, but I'm not that petty.

343
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,350
你们俩看见什么没有
Okay, you two. Did you see anything?

344
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,350
假装在涂色
Just pretend you're coloring.

345
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,770
你在干嘛
Okay, what are you doing?

346
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,780
我在尝试够到镜子
I'm trying to reach the mirror.

347
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,880
我眼睛里进东西了
I got something in my eye.

348
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,980
你好  这里是邓菲家
Hi, you've reached the Dunphys.

349
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,910
卢克为什么不接电话
Why isn't Luke picking up?

350
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,850
被一个刚被假释的
It's hard to reach the phone

351
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,090
比萨配送员绑住  的确很难接电话
when you're tied up by a recently paroled pizza guy.

352
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,660
你真幽默
Ha ha. You're very funny.

353
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,820
你干什么
What are you doing?

354
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,550
我知道这听起来很奇怪
I know it sounds weird.

355
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,450
也许是母亲的直觉吧
Call it mother's intuition,

356
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,600
但我有种不祥的预感
but I just have this feeling that something is wrong.

357
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,680
好吧  你爱怎样就怎样吧
Fine, do what you want,

358
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,110
但我已经忍了你...
but I've just about had it up to --

359
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,240
比这还要多
higher than here with this.

360
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,630
去死吧  送比萨的
Die, pizza man!

361
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,230
住手  住手
Stop! Stop!

362
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,180
妈妈啊  对不起
Oh. Sorry, mom.

363
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,200
告诉过你他能照顾好自己了
Told you he could take care of himself.

364
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,700
让开
Move.

365
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,790
她为什么要这样呢
Why does she do this?

366
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,470
我们的订位会被取消的
We're gonna lose our table.

367
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,260
她知道准时到达对我有多重要
She knows how important it is to me to be on time.

368
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,220
真是折磨人
This is torture.

369
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,180
你重点搞错了吧  杰
I think you've lost perspective, Jay.

370
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,500
你知道我愿付出多少来换取
You know what I would give to wait around

371
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,840
等待这样一个女人的权利吗
for a woman like that?

372
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,940
少来了  小变态
Reel it in, creepy.

373
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,460
你说的可是你亲娘
That's your mother up there.

374
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,770
抱歉  抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

375
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,130
我换了耳环之后  就得把鞋子也换了
Once I changed the earrings, I had to change the shoes.

376
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,910
然后我试穿了歌洛莉亚的一条裙子
And then I tried on one of Gloria's old dresses,

377
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,710
让我觉得自己像个10岁的小男孩
which made me feel like a 10-year-old boy.

378
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,460
你身材很棒
Ay, your body's beautiful.

379
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,110
我同意
I agree.

380
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,670
留着对外人说去
Take it outside the family.

381
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,100
准备好出发了吗
Okay, we ready to go?

382
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,770
等等  我拿错了口红
Wait. I have the wrong lipstick.

383
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,950
够了  我受够了
Oh! That's it! I've had it!

384
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,730
就给我一分钟
Just one minute!

385
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,030
你不可能一分钟内做完
Nothing takes a minute with you.

386
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,090
我们现在就走
We're leaving right now.

387
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,630
我不管你要干嘛
I don't care what you have to do.

388
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,380
你对我这么无礼也就算了
It's bad enough you're being rude to me,

389
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,490
但你这样对那些
but you're being rude

390
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,770
在等着我们的人太不尊重了
to the people sitting there waiting for us!

391
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,140
不好意思  你们是最先到的
Sorry, you're the first to arrive,

392
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,570
我们必须等到客人来齐后才能让您入座
and we can't seat you till everyone's here.

393
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,870
这下你开心了吧
I hope you're happy!

394
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,030
人都去哪儿了
Where the hell is everybody?

395
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,900
我讨厌这样等着别人
Yes, I hate waiting like this.

396
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,860
是吗
Do you?

397
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,840
就算其他人都迟到了
Just because everybody else is late

398
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,730
并不意味着我们迟到是对的
doesn't make it okay for us to be late.

399
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,720
你总是吼我  我没法快速准备好
I can't get ready fast with all the yelling!

400
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,530
我没有吼你
I wasn't yelling.

401
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,170
你又在吼我了
You see, you're doing it again!

402
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,920
歌洛莉亚  你每次都是这样
Gloria, you do this every single time.

403
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,370
如果你清楚你要花很长时间准备
If you know how long it takes you to get ready,

404
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,680
为什么不早点开始呢
why don't you start earlier?

405
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,910
我有原因
I have my reasons.

406
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,200
能告诉我吗
I would love to know them.

407
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,590
你会嘲笑人家的
You're going to be mean.

408
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,020
我保证我不会
I promise I won't be.

409
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,760
我喜欢华丽地登场
I like to make an entrance.

410
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,120
你说什么
What's that, now?

411
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,680
我喜欢我走进去的时候
I like the part where I go in,

412
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,190
大家都在等我
and everybody's waiting for me,

413
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,530
然后他们说
and they say,

414
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,380
"歌洛莉亚  你看起来好漂亮
"Gloria, you look so pretty,

415
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,730
那裙子好美啊"
and that dress is so beautiful."

416
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,130
这样有什么不好吗
Is that so bad?

417
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,290
我不喜欢
I don't love it.

418
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,420
这里真华丽呀
Oh, this room is so nice.

419
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,440
是啊  华丽得像...你这个禽兽
I know. It's almost as gorgeous as -- you monster!

420
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,660
什么  这个吗
What? Oh, this?

421
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,820
反正你也没法穿
Well, you know, you couldn't wear it,

422
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,740
所以我想  我何不穿呢
so I figured, what's the harm?

423
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,330
好  你知道吗  我现在要走过去
Mm. Okay, you know what? I will go over there,

424
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,520
然后我会一如既往地魅力十足
and I will be as socially magnetic as I always am.

425
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,870
我们暂且不提这事
We will put this on the back burner,

426
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,110
但我希望你知道  我内心已经气炸了
but underneath, I want you to know, I am fuming.

427
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,550
杰  歌洛莉亚呢
Hey, Jay, where's Gloria?

428
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,230
她刚刚还在那儿呢
She's -- she was there a second --

429
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,440
我的宝贝儿们来啦
There are my boys!

430
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,420
歌洛莉亚  你真漂亮
Gloria, you look so pretty.

431
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,770
这裙子太美了
That dress is so beautiful.

432
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,980
有没有搞错
You got to be kidding me.

433
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,640
你让他跟你一起看那些恐怖电视剧
You let him watch those scary shows with you,

434
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,020
然后我们大晚上把他一人留在家
and then we leave him home alone at night.

435
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,500
他当然会武装自己了
Of course he's gonna arm himself.

436
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,770
你给他讲"50种死法"前他都挺好的
He was fine until you gave him your "50 Ways to Die" speech.

437
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,200
有关"欢迎到来"地毯的说的是什么来着
What was the one about the welcome mat?

438
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,450
那种地毯非常易燃
They are highly flammable.

439
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,850
每年有7到10人死于地毯自燃
For seven to ten people a year,

440
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,050
毯子上不如写"欢迎来停尸房"好了
they may as well say, "Welcome to the morgue."

441
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,780
好了  别说了
You know what? Drop it.

442
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,820
我不想在公共场合吵架
I don't want to fight in public.

443
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,240
-太丢人了  -好吧
- It's embarrassing. - Fine.

444
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,800
你好吗
Hi, how are you?

445
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,560
晚上好  我很好
Good evening. Good.

446
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,020
我的腿麻了
Oh, my leg's asleep!

447
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,340
我的腿麻了  好了  谢谢
My leg's asleep! Okay, thank you.

448
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,050
先生  如果您的朋友们还不到
Sir, if the rest of your party doesn't arrive soon,

449
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,250
恐怕就得把桌子让给别人了
we have to give up your table.

450
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,070
马上就到
Any minute.

451
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,600
再次道歉  爸  我们迟到了
Again, dad, sorry we're late.

452
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,540
是啊  米奇尔放了点音乐
Yeah, you know, Mitchell put on some music,

453
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,620
我们边收拾边跳起舞来了
and we were primping and dancing around,

454
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,440
然后可能就忘记了时间
and I guess, well, we just lost track of time.

455
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,790
事实上  爸  真实情况是
Actually, dad, what happened

456
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,140
小卡玩了个把戏
was Cam was practicing this trick

457
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,440
假装善解人意  却神不知鬼不觉地
where he pretends to be accommodating

458
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,120
得到了自己想要的结果
and then magically gets his way.

459
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,820
他们来了
There they are.

460
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,560
我们要离开一下
We need a second.

461
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,880
小卡  别
Oh, Cam, no.

462
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,970
你们要去哪
Where are you guys going?

463
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,380
我不想说话  太生气了
Can't talk. Too mad.

464
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,640
天哪
Oh, God.

465
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,290
爸
Hi, dad.

466
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,100
歌洛莉亚在哪里
Where's Gloria?

467
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,750
她  看在老天爷的份上
She -- for the love of --

468
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,420
你们来了
There you are!

469
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,320
我的天啊  这裙子
Oh, my goodness! That dress!

470
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,570
歌洛莉亚  好家伙
Gloria, holy mackerel.

471
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,780
真抱歉  我们迟到了
We're so sorry we're late.

472
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,910
我们不得不把卢克送到你们家
We had to drop Luke off at your place.

473
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,830
菲尔想让他自己呆在家  但他害怕
Phil wanted him to stay home alone, but he got scared.

474
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,040
老天  真想赶紧吃点东西
Man, I can't wait to get some food

475
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,730
用食物堵住你的嘴
in my mouth and yours.

476
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,260
可怜的海莉
Poor Haley.

477
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,610
她带着那些男孩子要怎么办啊
What is she going to do with all those boys?

478
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,760
我会陪着他*
*I'll be with him

479
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,200
我料到你会*
*I know you will

480
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,930
搭午夜的火车去往乔治亚*
*On that midnight train to Georgia

481
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,240
搭午夜去往乔治亚的火车离去*
*Leaving on the midnight train to Georgia

482
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,520
你知道么
You know what?

483
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,520
我很讨厌你觉得我每次都得偿所愿
I resent the implication that I always get my way.

484
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,600
真的吗  "预留时间"卡片
Really? The "Save the date" cards.

485
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,720
为我们婚礼准备的那个吗
For our wedding?

486
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,020
那还是"我们"的婚礼啊
Oh. So, it is still our wedding.

487
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,430
我都不确定我是否被邀请了
I wasn't sure I was even invited

488
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,230
因为尽管你一直问我的意见
because you keep asking for my opinion

489
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,680
最后却总是按自己的意愿去做
and then doing the exact opposite.

490
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,410
-那只是特例  -那音乐呢
- That's one thing. - What about the music?

491
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,420
我们的爱值得乐队来衬托  而不是DJ
I think our love deserves a band, not a D.J.

492
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,160
那桌布呢
The tablecloths.

493
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,820
那种料子结实到可以用来做球鞋
They make sneakers out of that fabric.

494
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,870
你什么都不让我选  你想知道为什么吗
You won't let me pick one thing, and you want to know why?

495
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,390
因为我的品味比你好
Because I have better taste than you.

496
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,300
我想说的是因为你是个控制狂
I was gonna say because you're a control freak.

497
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,100
你怎么能认为我品味不好呢
And how can you think that I have bad taste?

498
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,990
我们今天选了一模一样的装扮
We chose the exact same outfit.

499
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,820
真的吗
Did we?

500
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:45,970
我穿了轻松的懒汉鞋
I wore fun loafers.

501
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,530
你穿了实用的牛津鞋
You wore sensible oxfords.

502
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,610
你的领口系的紧
Your collar's buttoned down.

503
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,860
我的是时下流行的敞开状
Mine's a more current widespread.

504
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,330
我选了一条醒目的方巾
And I chose a bold pocket square

505
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,090
去衬托衬衫的条纹
to bring out the stripe in the shirt,

506
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,470
所有这些都是你想不到的
all of which you wouldn't have thought of.

507
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,100
原因呢  我刚刚已经说过了
Because, well, I've already said.

508
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,330
你不喜欢我的牛津鞋吗
You don't like my oxfords?

509
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,870
对不起  我嘴太毒了
I'm sorry. I'm being harsh.

510
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,520
-他们还说得过去  -谢谢
- They're fine. - Thank you.

511
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,130
如果你是个乡村侦探的话
For a small-town detective.

512
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,820
好吧  我没忍住  我又毒舌了
Okay, look. I can't help myself. I did it again.

513
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,900
我不爱你的鞋
So, I-I don't love them.

514
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,080
但我爱你
But I do love you.

515
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,290
我不想让你感觉被冷落
And I don't want you to feel left out.

516
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,880
好  那让我在婚礼策划中有话语权
Okay. Then let me have a say in planning our wedding.

517
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,090
我们之前说好了的
That's what we agreed to.

518
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,920
你会的  你也应该有  对不起
You will, and you should, and I'm sorry.

519
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,760
谢谢
Thank you.

520
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,430
那你能为我做一件事吗
Can you just do one thing for me?

521
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,400
当然
Sure.

522
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,400
实话回答我  然后我就不会再提
Just be honest, and I'll let this go forever.

523
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,590
你到底有没有摇那罐汽水
Did you shake that can?

524
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,910
没有
No.

525
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,770
我再问一遍
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

526
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,220
看到了吗  菲尔
See, Phil?

527
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,050
他们不让曼尼独自呆在家
They don't let Manny stay home alone.

528
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,080
要不然为什么海莉会在那里
Why do you think Haley's there?

529
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,170
事实上  我们经常让曼尼自己在家
Actually, we let Manny stay home all the time,

530
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,220
有时  他还会做小蛋糕
and sometimes, he makes cupcakes,

531
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,180
现在要是能吃上一个就好了
which I could use one right about now --

532
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,400
或者烤土豆也行
or a potato.

533
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,640
海莉是去照顾乔的
Haley's there to take care of Joe.

534
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,470
你们确定么
Are you sure, guys?

535
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,620
因为克莱尔说的所有事都是对的
'cause Claire's always right about everything

536
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,080
一直以来  永永远远都是对的
all the time, forever and ever.

537
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,310
谢天谢地  他们来了
Thank god. Here they are.

538
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,510
菲奥纳  我们都到了
Fiona, we're all here.

539
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,290
事实上  爸  我们需要点时间
Actually, dad, we could use a moment.

540
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,280
我要吃我的手了
I'm going to eat my hand.

541
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,540
"乔马上坐起来了"
"Jo immediately sat up,

542
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,720
"把手插进了口袋  开始吹口哨"
"put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle.

543
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,650
"别这样  乔  太像男孩子了"
"Don't, Jo. It's so boyish."

544
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,780
"我就想这样"
"That's why I do it."

545
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,200
"粗鲁的假小子最讨厌了"
"I detest rude, unladylike girls."

546
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,370
"没个性又做作的小孩才讨厌"
"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits."

547
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,710
好吧  烂透了  我放弃
Okay, this stinks. I give up.

548
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,060
谢天谢地
Thank god.

549
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,460
想看看自己的头发吗
Want to see your hair?

550
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,180
莉莉  还挺好看的呢
Lily, that's actually good.

551
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,040
你真会化妆吗
Can you really do makeup?

552
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,720
好生等着
Stay there.

553
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,010
你在做这么大的决定前该跟我商量下
Is it really too much to ask that you consult me

554
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,500
我这个要求真的很过分吗
before you make such a big decision?

555
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,690
克莱尔  你决定重返职场时
Claire, when you went back to work,

556
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,130
把大权交付给了我
you asked me to take the reins.

557
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,700
那么你现在应当信任我才对
So I think you need to trust me now.

558
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,030
你真觉得我会让儿子陷入险境吗
Do you really think I'd put Luke in a dangerous situation?

559
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,810
我最疼他了  这话你就当没听见
He's my favorite, which I did not just say.

560
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,180
-如果他出点什么岔子  -不会的
- If anything happens to him... - It won't.

561
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,000
你没注意到吗  其实我很擅长处理这些
If you haven't noticed, I'm pretty good at this,

562
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,090
就跟你吝于夸赞我一样
as hard as it is for you to pay me a compliment.

563
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,570
你这话什么意思
Where is that coming from?

564
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,830
那你喜欢这套西服吗
Well, do you like this suit?

565
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,900
我无从知道
I wouldn't know

566
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,300
因为你只说它"有点儿紧"
because all you said was, "It's tight,"

567
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,000
而且还不是开玩笑说的
and not in a cool black way.

568
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,890
等等  你是想说你把自己
Wait, a-are you trying to say

569
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,130
塞进这身西装是为了取悦我吗
that you squeezed yourself in that for me?

570
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,050
是的
Yes.

571
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,820
你最近被工作弄得有些心烦
You've been a little distracted at work,

572
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,460
所以我想为你打扮一下
so I wanted to look nice for you.

573
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,480
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

574
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,170
我不好  是我不好
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

575
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,410
你是对的
You're right.

576
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,400
卢克可能本来好好的
Luke probably would have been fine,

577
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,530
是我自己放不下
and I am having a hard time letting go.

578
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,600
如果这世上我只信任一个人  那就是你
And if there's one person in the world I trust, it is you.

579
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,750
还有呢
And?

580
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,620
还有  你穿这套西装真性感
And...you look hot in that suit.

581
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,450
一会儿我们回家...
When we get home later...

582
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,120
行了  千万别往下说了
Okay, you're actually gonna need to stop.

583
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,830
这西服已经紧得不能再紧了
This suit can't get any tighter.

584
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,800
我们回来啦
Hey, we're back.

585
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,800
谁都不许再离开了
Nobody goes anywhere.

586
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,920
大家手拉手  我们赶紧去坐下
Everybody hold hands, and we go right to the table.

587
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,640
菲奥纳
Fiona?

588
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,570
实际上  我们把你们的桌子给别人了
Actually, we just gave away your table.

589
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,520
实在抱歉  但我提醒过你的
I'm sorry, but I did warn you about this.

590
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,350
你给我听着  菲奥莉娜
Listen to me, Fiorina.

591
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,070
这男人为了在你家馆子吃饭
This man has been waiting

592
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,350
已经等了好几个月了
to eat in this restaurant for months!

593
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,860
我们都很自私  害他迟到  
We were all selfish, and we made him late.

594
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,970
也许我是有点过分
And maybe I got a little crazy,

595
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,650
但这个等下再考虑
but I'm gonna think about that later.

596
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,460
但他没做错什么
But he has done nothing wrong!

597
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,220
所以在他吃到他天天念叨的
So we're not gonna leave this place

598
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,240
醉牛之前  我们是绝对不会
until he eats that drunk cow

599
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,530
离开这个地方的
that he can't shut up his mouth about!

600
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,430
怎么还傻愣在那
Why you haven't moved?

601
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,880
昨晚我吃到了人生中最美味的一餐
Last night, I had the greatest meal I've ever had,

602
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,710
要不是因为歌洛莉亚让我们
and it never would have happened

603
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,450
被那店大欺客的餐厅赶了出来
if Gloria hadn't got us kicked out

604
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,990
我是没办法享受到的
of that snooty restaurant.

605
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,770
玉米饼
Tacos.

606
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,410
-玉米饼  -我得吃一个
- Tacos. - I need a taco.

607
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,390
-太好了  -玉米饼贩卖车
- Yes. - Taco truck!

608
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,690
太好吃了
That is delicious.

609
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,080
说真的  谁穿得更好看
No, but seriously, who looks better?

610
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,480
也不知道是因为等他们时喝掉的
I don't know if it was the six scotches I drank

611
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,900
六杯苏格兰威士忌作祟
waiting for everybody,

612
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,290
还是因为我早饭之后就没吃过东西
or the fact that I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast...

613
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,020
或是因为菲尔的西服终于撑不住了
or the moment Phil's suit finally gave up.

614
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,090
他们甚至放了我最爱的音乐
They even played my favorite song.

615
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,900
他正离去*
*He's leaving

616
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:49,900
离去*
*Leaving

617
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,760
搭午夜的火车去往乔治亚*
*On that midnight train to Georgia

618
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,770
搭午夜的火车离去*
*Leaving on the midnight train

619
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,230
说要回去找寻*
*Said he's going back to find

620
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,240
回去找寻*
*Going back to find

621
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,370
那更单纯的地方和时光*
*the simpler place and time

622
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,190
是的  他正离去*
*Oh, yes, he is

623
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,390
我会陪着他*
*And I'll be with him

624
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,740
是的  他要离去*
*Yes, he will

625
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,880
搭午夜的火车去往乔治亚*
*On that midnight train to Georgia

626
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,390
我永远赶不上午夜列车
A train I'd never make

627
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,490
除非我告诉歌洛莉亚火车11点开
unless I told Gloria it left at 11:00.

628
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,040
我宁愿活在他的世界里*
*I'd rather live in his world

629
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,790
也不愿独自过活*
*than live without him in mine

630
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,580
给你
Here you go.

631
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,960
不知道你要喝什么
I didn't know what you wanted to drink,

632
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
所以就买了汽水
so I just got you this soda.

633
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,590
可以的  谢谢
That's fine. Thank you.

634
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,540
小卡  你动了什么手脚
Cam, what did you do?

635
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,940
动了跟你一样的手脚
I did exactly what you did

636
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,720
因为我太了解你了
because I know you so well.

637
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,600
我没摇那罐汽水
I didn't shake the soda.

638
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,160
那就没什么可担心的了
Then you have nothing to worry about,

639
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,570
直接打开吧
so go ahead and open it.

640
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,340
我摇了  好吧
I shook it, okay?

641
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,010
我的确摇了  是我摇的
I shook the soda. I shook it up!

642
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,230
满意了吗
Are you happy?

643
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,680
我的行为小心眼  愚蠢还很恶毒
It was petty and stupid and awful.

644
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,630
对不起
I'm sorry.

645
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,680
该死
Damn it.
