18
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,590
This isn't my usual seat in a speeding ambulance.

19
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,550
You vomited and passed out.

20
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,420
You have a three-inch abdominal bruise

21
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,870
and a big bump on your head,

22
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,080
- either of which could... - You can check it all out tomorrow.

23
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:20,410
As soon as I'm back at the hospital,

24
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,760
I'm going back to treating patients.

25
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,720
They must be on overflow.

26
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,820
As soon as we're back at the hospital,

27
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,260
you are getting a CT.

28
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,310
You could have increasing intracranial pressure

29
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,400
from contusions, edema, or a hematoma.

30
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,270
I don't.

31
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,430
I'm pretty sure I know my symptoms better than you do.

32
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,420
No headache, no unilateral weakness.

33
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,660
The doctor without the head injury makes the call.

34
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,240
There's the rupture.

35
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,110
The fallopian tube's necrotic.

36
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,330
DeBakey forceps.

37
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,290
BP's stabilizing at 90 over 65.

38
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,190
- I'll take the clamp. - I'm fine. You remove the laps.

39
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,140
It's better if you do it.

40
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,630
Less likely to damage your hands.

41
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,170
We need six hands, we've got four,

42
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,600
and you want us to work with two?

43
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,630
I need 2-0 chromic catgut.

44
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,120
His heart's shifted from the pressure on his chest.

45
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,670
Try retracting it to the right.

46
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,920
There's nowhere for it to go.

47
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,890
Close him up. We'll have to go in through his side.

48
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,310
That won't be easier.

49
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,950
Well, it better be, 'cause this way is impossible.

50
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,460
Hello?

51
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,090
Yes. Shaun.

52
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,900
- Lea? - Yeah, it's me. You okay?

53
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,440
Why is it still you?

54
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,910
I'm fine. I wanted to stay and help.

55
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,060
No, I don't need you, okay?

56
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,550
I need a rescue worker.

57
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,120
They're taking in a lot of scaffolding and stuff

58
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,670
hoping to reinforce the walls.

59
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,580
The water should be a priority.

60
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,640
They shut off the main.

61
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,630
They don't know why it's still flowing.

62
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,720
We're gonna drown in about five minutes!

63
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,040
That's not true.

64
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,710
At the rate the water is filling,

65
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,220
we have about an hour.

66
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,990
And I could leave.

69
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,450
I am going to cut the rebar to free you.

70
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,610
I didn't do it before

71
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,360
because it risks rupturing your posterior tibial artery,

72
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,510
but now we need to.

73
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,490
Take this.

74
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,020
Cutting will intermittently cause your leg to move,

75
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,610
which will cause a lot of pain.

76
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,160
How did you deal with your heartache?

77
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,470
- Are you just asking to keep me calm? - Yes.

78
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,240
Distracting you from the disastrous situation you're in

79
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,200
will help keep your blood pressure down.

80
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,020
Oh, and reduce bleeding.

81
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,510
Honesty was the problem with my ex.

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,850
I opened up to him, told him everything.

83
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,640
In return...

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,790
he didn't.

85
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,850
Were you being honest when you said

86
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,810
you were going to move on after this?

87
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,610
One upside of being impaled on rebar underground

88
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,130
in a room slowly filling with water

89
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,240
is it focuses your priorities.

90
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,150
Yeah.

91
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,430
I'm moving on.

92
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,870
If you loved him...

93
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,070
maybe you can't.

94
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,530
- I told you. - What?

95
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,050
Be quiet. Be still.

96
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,460
The machine is already past the point

97
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,110
where you would have seen any damage.

98
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,480
The fact that you haven't said anything

99
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,720
means you're either trying to figure out

100
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,910
how to tell me I'm going to die

101
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,680
or you're trying to figure out

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,690
how to apologize for wasting my time.

103
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,460
You're right. I'm glad your brain is fine.

104
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,180
I'm not sorry at all.

105
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,050
Appreciate the excessive concern.

106
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,920
Now I can get out of here and to patients

107
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,750
and you can get back to the winery to help.

108
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,950
Brewery.

109
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,100
Oh, come on. I misspoke.

110
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,200
Been a bit of a rough day, you hear?

111
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,290
There was an earthquake.

112
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,160
I've seen you on a lot of rough days,

113
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,220
but not once have I seen you confused.

114
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,470
Move your gown.

115
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,250
You're bleeding internally.

116
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,410
I need baci irrigation, and then we can start closing her up.

117
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,600
Dr. Reznick.

118
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,130
Please step back, Dr. Andrews.

119
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,250
We're trying to keep this area as sterile as possible.

120
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,190
Glad you're aware it's not an actual operating room

121
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,640
that you seem to be operating in.

122
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,960
There weren't any available.

123
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,430
And there weren't any surgeons, either.

124
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,250
- Suction. - So, you violated Dr. Glassman's order

125
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,350
to not use your hands.

126
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,650
Ectopic pregnancy.

127
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,480
The fallopian tube ruptured.

128
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,900
Patient would have died.

129
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,510
Oh-Maxon sutures.

130
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,290
You could have found another way,

131
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,910
but you wanted to be a hero.

132
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,800
Get your hands out of the patient

133
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,230
and take them to your room.

134
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,350
I'll finish.

135
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,430
He has a traumatic dissection

136
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,240
all the way to the ascending aorta.

137
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,700
The clamp would tear through the vessel wall.

138
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,160
He'd bleed out.

139
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,960
And if we clamp proximal to it,

140
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,530
he'd lose perfusion to his head.

141
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,850
He'll be brain-dead.

142
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,580
You should go back to the hospital.

143
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,790
I'll stay with the boy.

144
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,360
Who's in charge?

145
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,350
First Andrews

146
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,140
then Morgan, then Andrews again.

147
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,640
She's back in her patient room. He's in surgery.

148
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,200
- Alright, what do you got? - Bay 4.

149
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,220
Otherwise healthy 35-year-old with chest pain.

150
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,630
- High sensitivity troponins back? - First was negative.

151
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,680
Repeat the tropes in an hour.

152
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,230
If there's still no change, discharge him.

153
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,790
Bay 2 -- 16-year-old.

154
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,300
Dresser fell on her leg.

155
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,330
- Normal pulse and sensory exam? - Yes.

156
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,570
It's a non-displaced fracture.

157
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,960
Prep her for a posterior slab and book a follow-up.

158
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,880
Dr. Lim.

159
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,050
- Who is this? - Dr. Melendez.

160
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,550
Dr. Park.

161
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,940
So, how'd it go?

162
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,820
Not good, Casey.

163
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,020
We couldn't fix things.

164
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,740
When we take this off you, you'll start bleeding,

165
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,960
and we won't be able to stop it.

166
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,720
You're gonna die.

167
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,910
No.

168
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,120
No, no, no. You're wrong.

169
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,890
You gotta -- you gotta be wrong.

170
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,730
Man, where's... where's my dad?

171
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,850
He's on his way.

172
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,930
We're gonna keep you comfortable.

173
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,420
I'm not in pain, okay?

174
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,680
You gotta be wrong.

175
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,320
I'm sorry, Casey.

176
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,350
Where's my dad?

177
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,600
Isn't "moving on" just a euphemism

178
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,110
for giving up, for failure?

179
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,050
Do you really believe that?

180
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,970
Do you think you failed?

181
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,720
Accepting...loss

182
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,780
makes us stronger.

183
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:12,210
Refusing to accept failure makes us not fail.

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,880
If we keep fighting till we succeed, then --

185
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,090
Th-- that's not true!

186
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,460
It traps us,

187
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,510
prevents us from moving on to other victories.

188
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,070
Your hematocrits suggest you're still bleeding.

189
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,900
Appears to be in the retroperitoneum.

190
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,430
Probably from the pancreas.

191
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,220
If we open you up,

192
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,630
it means major resections and reconstructions,

193
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,990
and you could end up with ostomy or diabetes.

194
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,630
I'm well aware of the risks of abdominal surgery.

195
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,140
The more conservative approach

196
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,490
is an angio for embolization to stop the bleed.

197
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,310
Less invasive --

198
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,880
Again, aware.

199
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,280
Do the embolization.

200
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,900
In this case,

201
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,070
I don't think it's actually safer.

202
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,850
If the bleed isn't from the pancreas,

203
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,980
we'll have to keep poking around till we find it,

204
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,230
and it might be too late.

205
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,040
You want to do the surgery instead?

206
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,440
Not really.

207
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,490
But Claire's right.

208
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,520
We've been able to get a satellite hook-up to your dad.

209
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,680
Do you want me to talk to him first?

210
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,030
No, I need to talk to him.

211
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,560
Son?

212
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,820
Dad, I'm sorry.

213
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,860
Dad, I'm so sorry.

214
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,930
I can't hear you. Say that again.

215
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,890
Are you hurt?

216
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,170
Dad, it's -- it's my fault, okay? I --

217
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,860
Can you hear me? Just be strong, okay?

218
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,610
- Dad! - Casey!

219
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,320
Dad!

220
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:55,940
Get him back.

221
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,060
The plane's caught in a storm.

222
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,800
- I don't know if it'll... - Get him back.

223
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,330
Divide the gastro-colic ligament and expose the pancreas.

224
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,020
It's a branch of the superior mesenteric artery that's torn,

225
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,040
not his pancreas.

226
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,940
Good call.

227
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,600
I need to resect the devitalized tissue

228
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,930
to get a healthy anastomosis.

229
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,150
We need clamps and 6-0 vicryls on Castros.

230
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,920
Dr. Lim?

231
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,900
Above the SMA, the small bowel...

232
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,220
There are three ways to stop a bleeding vessel --

233
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,510
clamp, cauterize, or repair.

234
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,600
Since this vessel is made of steel,

235
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,690
clamping requires a 60-ton press,

236
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,680
and cauterization requires an oxyacetylene torch.

237
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,030
I don't need to stop the water.

238
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,310
Just slow it down.

239
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,260
You're good at a-adapting to challenges.

240
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,550
Yes, I am.

241
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,900
Blindly keeping on sawing wasn't gonna work.

242
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,850
No.

243
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,780
But it wasn't a failure.

244
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,350
Because cutting the rebar wasn't your goal.

245
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,430
Saving me was your goal.

246
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,350
And your goal isn't Lea.

247
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,760
It's love.

248
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,240
I think the scar will work with the tattoos.

249
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,960
The bleed wasn't from the pancreas.

250
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,410
It was from the SMA.

251
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,370
But we found additional injuries

252
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,130
all the way to the celiac trunk.

253
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,190
Ischemic bowel?

254
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,480
Early stages.

255
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,450
We have restored full blood flow and reperfused.

256
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,190
I'm sure the bowel is gonna be just fine.

257
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,120
How sure?

258
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,530
What's my lactate?

259
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,150
Four.

260
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,770
Means there's already been some failure of the bowel wall.

261
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,420
We're going to re-test your lactate.

262
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,880
And I'm sure it'll have gone down.

263
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,010
But if it's gone up, it means ischemia is progressing,

264
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,170
and there'll be more bacterial leakage.

265
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,410
Which in turn will mean septic shock...

266
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,080
...past the point of treatment.

267
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,530
We're not there yet.

268
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,090
Let him know it's still gonna be a while.

269
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,400
How long is a while?

270
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,510
Sorry. I don't know.

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,700
He says they're gonna drown in 15 minutes.

272
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,940
Is "A while" more or less than 15 minutes?

273
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,720
That last tremor made things too unstable

274
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,940
to send my crew down.

275
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,000
You're supposed to be saving lives.

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,650
You're supposed to be the heroes.

277
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,240
If you let me, what I'm gonna do right now

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,150
is help my crew get in more braces, scaffolding,

279
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,160
and heavy machinery.

280
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,580
What you need to do right now

281
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,010
is convince Dr. Murphy to get out of there.

282
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,700
Talk to me, Casey.

283
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,240
I'm -- I'm tired.

284
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,760
Let's just...talk.

285
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,180
Why do you need to apologize to your father?

286
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,330
What do you think you did?

287
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,640
Whatever it is, there's nothing you could have done

288
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,380
that he's gonna be mad about right now.

289
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,220
You don't know anything.

290
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,860
I know how a father feels.

291
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,810
I know no matter how mad or how ugly things get,

292
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,900
we don't stop loving our children.

293
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,610
I killed my mother.

294
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,090
You need to get out.

295
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,060
- Soon. - Not soon, Shaun.

296
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,830
You need to get out now. It's not stable.

297
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,250
Vera can't leave.

298
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,210
The firefighters told me they're making great headway,

299
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,970
and they'll be able to save Vera soon,

300
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,700
but you need to get out of the way.

301
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,390
Are you lying?

302
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,500
You need to go, Shaun.

303
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,740
If I leave, you die.

304
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,090
If you stay,

305
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,690
we both die.

306
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,430
You can't cut through the rebar in time.

307
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,680
I can't cut through the rebar.

308
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,720
But I can cut through your leg.

309
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,210
During the Civil War, there was a doctor

310
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,740
who could amputate limbs in under three minutes,

311
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,620
which kept blood loss and pain to a minimum,

312
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,510
thus reducing the effect of shock.

313
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,350
Our scalpels are sharper,

314
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,820
so I can slice through the skin and muscle faster,

315
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,470
and I only sawed the rebar with the top half of the saw.

316
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,420
So the bottom half is still pristine

317
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,680
to get through the bone.

318
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,580
Do you consent to the procedure?

319
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,610
No.

320
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:42,980
I have one condition.

321
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,710
You have to promise me

322
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,170
that if I don't make it,

323
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,780
you'll move on.

324
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,160
You deserve to find love.

325
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,530
You need to.

326
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,920
You're down here risking your life for me, right?

327
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,150
Well, this is me risking my life for you.

328
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,670
Promise me you'll move on, Shaun.

329
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,110
Promise.

330
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,180
I promise.

331
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,410
Let's do this.

332
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,820
The year before med school,

333
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,640
I took six months off,

334
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,410
backpacked across Southeast Asia.

335
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,380
Hostels were three bucks a night.

336
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,170
Beer was 50 cents.

337
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,840
And I found this little island in Thailand,

338
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,420
Koh Lanta.

339
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,940
Nothing but bamboo huts and palm trees.

340
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,730
Stayed eight days.

341
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,630
Read "Moby Dick."

342
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,180
Fell in love.

343
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,850
How high?

344
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,300
High.

345
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,830
8.1
8.1.

346
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,850
The place is probably overrun with tourists now.

347
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,680
She had an accident.

348
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,770
Nothing, really. Mom didn't even report it.

349
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,270
But it was big enough to mess with her neck.

350
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,180
A lot of pain.

351
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,030
But she was dealing with it.

352
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,120
I thought.

353
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,940
She became dependent on the pills?

354
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,330
Going through her purse,

355
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,520
looking to steal a couple bucks for the movies...

356
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,720
...found three half-full prescription bottles.

357
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,250
Same drug.

358
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,310
What did you do?

359
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,210
Nothing.

360
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,920
I didn't say anything to her or my dad.

361
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,920
I-I-I didn't know what to say.

362
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,120
Three weeks later, she OD'd in her sleep.

363
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,340
He would've gotten her help.

364
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,850
I need to tell him.

365
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,440
You will.

366
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,800
I promise.

367
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,740
When I was a second-year resident,

368
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,100
I was assigned to a Dr. Wilmet Fortingale.

369
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,010
Full of himself, sarcastic, thin-skinned.

370
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,000
Our first case together,

371
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,510
I saw he screwed up.

372
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,720
And I called him on it.

373
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,370
He lit into me.

374
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,690
What kind of ego I must have,

375
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,660
what little regard I must have for my superiors,

376
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,130
how hard it must be for me to trust anyone in my life.

377
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,640
Two days later, the M&M,

378
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,770
guess who screwed up.

379
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,030
Me.

380
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,960
When you're a resident,

381
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,200
you think you know everything.

382
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,770
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,090
I should've told you about my diagnosis.

384
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,890
It's hard.

385
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,900
And what that showed me is that you don't respect protocol

386
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,590
and you don't respect your superiors, your patients.

387
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,840
The only thing you care about is your own career.

388
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,430
And again, I was wrong.

389
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,070
What you did today for your patient was remarkable.

390
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,790
You made it clear

391
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,180
that saving lives is your first priority.

392
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,200
Unfortunately...

393
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,160
...it may have cost you your career as a surgeon.

394
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,960
You've traumatized your joint capsule incisions.

395
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,500
I'm sorry.

396
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,720
I'm not afraid to die.

397
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,060
I was raised a good Catholic,

398
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,600
altar boy,

399
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,480
First Communion...

400
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,380
...faithfully wore my silver crucifix

401
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,820
that Tía Abebe gave me for Confirmation.

402
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,370
I was a true believer.

403
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,830
Then I went to college.

404
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,170
And maybe it's just now that I'm...

405
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,550
staring into the yawning void,

406
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,920
I'm hedging my bet, but...

407
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,640
...it's coming back to me.

408
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,100
Like an old friend with a warm hug.

409
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,060
I want you to know that I --

410
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,130
Don't.

411
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,840
You should go.

412
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,430
This place still has a crisis going on.

413
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,530
Goodbye, Claire.

414
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,030
Goodbye.

415
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,880
96.1.

416
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,750
That's okay.

417
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:24,010
Feels way colder than 96.

418
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,510
Feels like...

419
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,140
f-fifty-six.

420
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,850
46.

421
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,900
- 36. - Casey.

422
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,780
- 26. - Casey.

423
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,570
Hey, stay with me just a little longer.

424
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,530
I can't give you any more epi.

425
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,070
Casey?

426
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,260
Dad?

427
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,060
Yeah.

428
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,430
I'm right here.

429
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,210
You had morphine?

430
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,990
I saved it in case I needed to do this.

431
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,240
- Good thinking not telling me. - Yes.

432
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,450
The upside

433
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,470
In three minutes, I'm gonna lose 10 pounds.

434
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:36,140
I'd say only 8, unless you count blood loss and --

435
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,710
Do you take everything literally?

436
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,920
No.

437
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,170
Lea,

438
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,310
I need you to count off the seconds from 1 to 180.

439
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:47,340
I want to know how close I am to three minutes.

440
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,880
How will that help you?

441
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,600
I don't think it will.

442
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,560
But it may help distract you from the screaming.

443
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,390
- Ready? - N-no!

444
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,440
Just do it, for God's sakes!

445
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,040
One...

446
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,960
...two...

447
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,670
three...

448
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,970
I want to go back in.

449
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,200
If we resect more bowel and do a trauma Whipple, I --

450
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,560
A trauma Whipple?

451
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,890
It's a big surgery.

452
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,870
Okay, a huge surgery,

453
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,990
and there's obviously no guarantee

454
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,200
and lots of complications,

455
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,690
but if we act now, I feel like we --

456
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,330
Let's just hold on for one second.

457
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,000
First of all, we are talking about Melendez, correct?

458
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,030
Secondly...

459
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,090
we do know the numbers.

460
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,030
They're terrible.

461
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:56,790
And maybe so's this idea, but that's how this works.

462
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,340
You shoot down mine, I shoot down yours

463
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,580
until we come up with a viable solution.

464
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,130
Okay, here goes. 

465
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,590
The mesenteric bypass already failed.

466
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,190
His lactates have more than doubled, from 4 to 8.1.

467
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,190
Any significant revascularization

468
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,900
is already out of the question.

469
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,520
By some miracle he were to survive the surgery,

470
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,350
he'd be tube-fed, a diabetic with an ostomy bag,

471
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,650
waiting for a liver transplant.

472
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:31,610
Your turn.

473
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,660
It's time to stop being a doctor.

474
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,950
Be a friend.

475
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,460
Dad, I knew.

476
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,640
I-I knew about Mom.

477
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,850
I-I knew about the drugs.

478
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:04,980
I should have told you.

479
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,610
I knew, too.

480
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,700
Of course I knew.

481
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,000
When you love someone,

482
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,710
you know when something's wrong.

483
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,270
But, Dad, if you knew...

484
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,630
I did what I thought I could.

485
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,510
Sometimes...

486
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,390
you can help them, but...

487
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,600
sometimes there's just nothing anyone can do.

488
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,230
And we were the adults.

489
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,250
It was our problem, our responsibility,

490
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,280
never yours, Casey.

491
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,740
It was never your fault.

492
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,750
...67...

493
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,760
...68, 69, 70...

494
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,230
I made it to the bone.

495
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,430
...71...72...

496
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,560
- You need to stay conscious, Vera! - ...74...

497
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,470
75.

498
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,770
Keep counting!

499
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,110
80...81...

500
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,690
I'm sorry.

501
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,490
I should've been able to do more.

502
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,240
Faster, better.

503
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,160
I know you want to find blame.

504
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,870
If there's blame, there's a reason.

505
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,120
Sometimes...

506
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,550
...there just isn't.

507
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,760
It pisses me off, too.

508
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:09,350
I could have spent a lifetime drinking whiskey with you.

509
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,400
I was even starting to like it neat.

510
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,700
What did we do?

511
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,580
No blame.

512
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,150
...150...151...152...153...

513
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,730
...154...

514
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,150
Vera! Vera!

515
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,410
Exhale! Breathe out!

516
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:10,660
...172...173...174...

517
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,210
...one-seventy...

518
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,300
...179...180.

519
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,680
That's three minutes, Shaun!

520
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,680
Shaun?

521
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,230
Shaun?

522
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,570
Shaun, can you hear me?

523
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,980
Shaun!

524
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,570
Dad, it's so cold.

525
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,320
I know.

526
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm sorry.

527
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,790
We should go snowboarding.

528
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,370
If you teach me one of your tricks.

529
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,920
You'd break your leg.

530
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,460
Mom would kill me.

531
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,590
Good point.

532
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,720
I love you, Dad.

533
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,230
I love you, too.

534
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,450
We have him on the line now.

535
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,870
Let's get this bar off him.

536
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,170
Mr. Taylor. I'm Dr. Park.

537
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,140
Lea?

538
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,060
It's time to go.

539
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,390
I can't.

540
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,500
There's nothing left to do.

541
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,110
We should get you checked out.

542
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,110
We've got something.

543
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,610
Hey, you need a helmet!

544
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,710
I heard the A's picked up another reliever.

545
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,840
Yeah.

546
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,110
I keep thinking, what's gonna happen

547
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,930
to the next Theresa Adams?

548
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,770
Remember her?

549
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,360
Gallbladder.

550
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,900
Or so we thought.

551
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,540
We get in there, it's completely healthy.

552
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,530
I blame it on lousy imaging.

553
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,880
You call a duodenal ulcer blocking the duct.

554
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,080
Saved her life.

555
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,250
Just so you know...

556
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,920
...you're the best I ever worked with.

557
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,180
A bottle of Macallan says they win the division.

558
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,900
25 or 17?

559
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,810
25.

560
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,980
It's a sucker bet.

561
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,860
Hey, it's my funeral.

562
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,470
I'll look forward to that scotch.

563
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,770
I got you something.

564
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,440
You saved me.

565
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,110
No.

566
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,080
I was just in the right place...

567
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,580
at the right time.

568
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,580
That was all you.

569
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,050
You're gonna be okay, Claire.

570
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,850
There's something I need to tell you.

571
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,560
Me too.

572
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,020
I go first.

573
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,690
You...

574
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,570
are...

575
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,410
...a terrible bowler.

576
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,870
Maybe the worst I've ever seen.

577
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,880
And I wanted to tell you that I hate your tattoo.

578
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,800
Way too much antler.

579
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,350
I love you.

580
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,980
I love you, too.

581
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,600
It's the start of a new day.

582
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,400
Yes. It is.

583
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,530
That was both literally true and a metaphor.

Hey, Mia.

590
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,150
No, I-I'm fine.

591
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,220
I'm just, uh...

592
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,060
just tired.

593
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,730
I have to be, uh,

594
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,020
closer to you guys.

595
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,360
I'm gonna move back.

596
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,910
Hey, is Kellan there?

597
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,910
I need to hear his voice.

00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,270
We should get a drink sometime.

604
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,770
I'd like that.

605
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,080
I made a promise to Vera.

606
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,420
I don't know what that was.

607
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,650
It could be a practice kiss

608
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,690
or a pity kiss or a goodbye kiss.

609
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,890
That was an "I'm such a stupid idiot for not seeing it,

610
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,940
but I love you with all my heart" kiss.

611
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,690
