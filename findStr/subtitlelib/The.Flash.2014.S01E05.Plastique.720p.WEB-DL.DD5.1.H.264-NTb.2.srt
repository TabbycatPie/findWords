1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:06,271
- My name is barry allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:08,173
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,175
By something impossible.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,542
- Run, barry.
Run.

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,345
- My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:17,282
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,985
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensics scientist,

8
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,987
But secretly, I use my speed

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,690
To fight crime
and find others like me.

10
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,026
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother.

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,595
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

12
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,463
I am the flash.

13
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,199
Previously, on <i>the flash...</i>

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,934
- Who do you think you are?

15
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,537
- This is what we talked about,
using my speed to do good.

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,306
- We talked about you helping
us contain other meta-humans.

17
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:43,642
- After all of these journalism
classes, I started a blog.

18
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:44,777
- I thought you were taking
journalism,

19
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,211
Not science fiction writing.

20
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,546
- Ever since I have known you,

21
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,348
You have believed
in the impossible.

22
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,116
What if you were right about
the night that your mom died?

23
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,719
Something out there
is saving people.

24
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,791
- See you soon, barry.

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,761
- How often do you think about

26
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,496
Why your friends came
into your life?

27
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:08,500
Was it random, by design,
or maybe a little of both?

28
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,236
- Nice.

29
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:14,506
- Regardless of the reason,
some friends you just know

30
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:17,509
Are gonna be by your side
for a while.

31
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,779
Others, you're not so sure.

32
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,583
And then there's that one
friend who, well, you hope,

33
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,587
Someday becomes something more.

34
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,557
But "friend"
will have to do for now.

35
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:33,659
And that's okay.

36
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,561
I guess.

37
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,863
- I'm glad
you invited caitlin and cisco.

38
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:38,997
- They're cool, right?

39
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,699
- They saved your life, barry.

40
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,868
That makes them the coolest
people I've ever met.

41
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,504
It's nice
that you guys became friends.

42
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,708
To friends, old and new.

43
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,514
Ooh.
I'm up.

44
00:01:55,516 --> 00:01:59,384
Wish me luck.

45
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:01,153
I'm going to destroy you.

46
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:03,155
- Don't get cocky, west.

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,496
- Guys?
I have a problem.

48
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:13,432
- We all do when guys
like him exist.

49
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:16,068
- Yeah, he's so hot.

50
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,670
Uh, I mean,
genetically speaking.

51
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,506
Because I'm a geneticist,
of course.

52
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:21,907
Oh, my god,
do I sound like felicity?

53
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,475
- I'm not talking about eddie.

54
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,746
I'm talking about this.

55
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,581
I can't feel anything.

56
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,918
- Yeah, that's usually what
happens when you drink too much.

57
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,154
- No, the alcohol
is not affecting me.

58
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,389
I mean I literally feel nothing.

59
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,625
- It's your hypermetabolism.
I need a sample.

60
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:40,826
- I'll get more shots.

61
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,794
- I swear,
I had a vacutainer here.

62
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,663
- Wait, you carry a blood
collection kit in your purse?

63
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,632
- You have your hobbies.

64
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,278
- 14th floor is secure.
- Roger that.

65
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,621
Hold off on that check.

66
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,564
Lock down the building!

67
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,166
Hold it!

68
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,401
- Don't come near me.

69
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:26,872
- You need to come with me.
Come on.

70
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,473
- Get down!

71
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,061
- Still nothing?
- I can't get drunk.

72
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,495
I mean, I'm only 25,

73
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,863
And my drinking days
are already over.

74
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,198
- Come on, allen.
You're up.

75
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,704
There was a bombing
on 8th and pass.

76
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:00,639
I got to go, babe.
- Okay.

77
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,474
- Sorry, guys.

78
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,443
- I've got an early shift
at jitters.

79
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,378
Barry, we'll catch up tomorrow.

80
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,147
- It's getting late, anyway,
so I'm just gonna...

81
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,624
- Help! Help!

82
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,525
Somebody!

83
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:23,061
- Guys, there's a window washer,
and he's gonna fall.

84
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:24,196
- Don't try and catch him.

85
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,764
You don't have super strength.

86
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,432
- Well, is there,
like, a bed store near here?

87
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,401
What if I get a bunch
of mattresses and stack them?

88
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,770
- Barry,
this isn't a roadrunner cartoon.

89
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,572
- Help! Help!

90
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,275
- How fast would I need to go to
run up the side of a building?

91
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:38,777
- How far up do you need to go?

92
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,080
- Hurry, somebody!

93
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,116
- I don't know.
50 meters, give or take.

94
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,618
- 32.56...

95
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,690
- Guys, hurry!
- Help!

96
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,625
- Just run really fast
and you'll be fine.

97
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,628
But you need to maintain your
velocity on the way down, or...

98
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,897
- Or what?

99
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,098
- Splat.

100
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,867
- Great.
- Help!

101
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:06,104
- All right.
All right, all right, all right.

102
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,207
Here goes.

103
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,680
- Barry?
What do you got?

104
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:52,517
- Bombers typically have
their own unique signatures.

105
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,686
Crimped wires, fragmentation.

106
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,989
The level of sophistication is
telling once I've analyzed it.

107
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,492
You show me a bomb,
I can usually find a clue in it.

108
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,194
- It sounds like
there's a "but" coming.

109
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,730
- Yeah, I haven't found any sign
of an oxidizing agent.

110
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,665
It's as if the floor
just blew itself up.

111
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,266
- Things don't just blow up.

112
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:11,770
- Security guard said our bomber
was a woman, red hair.

113
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,705
Must've cut
the security camera's feed.

114
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,775
There's no footage, but
there might be something else.

115
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:21,012
Some kind of small charge
blasted the doorknob off.

116
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,382
- Any idea what's missing?

117
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,117
- My guess is one
of these files.

118
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:27,352
It's gonna take days
to figure out which one.

119
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:32,023
- Let's let barry do his thing.

120
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,284
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

121
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,353
But they came in here
like they own the place.

122
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:04,423
Been talking to singh
for the last half hour.

123
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,224
- This can't be good.

124
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,232
- General eiling,
this is detective west.

125
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,002
- Detective.

126
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,670
- What's this all about?

127
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,606
- The army's taking over
the bombing investigation.

128
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,308
- I'll need everything you have.

129
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,243
Physical evidence,
photographs, witness interviews,

130
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,611
And all your personal notes.

131
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,346
- I've been on the job
nearly 20 years

132
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:30,482
And never heard of the army
investigating anything civilian.

133
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:35,153
- Well, it's not civilian.
She's one of ours.

134
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,788
- We'll send over
everything we got.

135
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,623
- Very kind of you.

136
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:42,627
I think we'll take it now,
though.

137
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,264
- Give them what they want, joe.

138
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,601
- You heard him, joe.
Give me what I want.

139
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,247
- Hey, what's going on?

140
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,083
- General eiling is relieving us
from the bombing case.

141
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:09,554
Give these men everything
that's relevant.

142
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,289
- Sure thing, yeah.

143
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,831
- You and a few civilians
from S.T.A.R. Labs

144
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,000
Might want to check into that.

145
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,735
- I think we might.

146
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,071
- Can I talk to you for
a minute, joe?

147
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:27,672
It's about iris.

148
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,876
- Hey, dad.
You're home early.

149
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,845
- What were you doing
at the bomb site last night?

150
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,682
Don't deny you were there.
Officer vukuvich saw you.

151
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,985
- It's... Complicated.

152
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,887
- You can't be coming
to every crime scene

153
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:42,954
Because you're worried
about eddie.

154
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,322
He's a big boy, iris.

155
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:45,891
- I didn't go there
to see eddie.

156
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:49,394
I went there to see the streak.

157
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:57,369
- The streak.
Hmm, why is that?

158
00:08:57,371 --> 00:08:58,737
- My blog.

159
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,338
I've been collecting
internet posts

160
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,743
About the streak sightings,
and writing about them.

161
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,444
- Baby, there's no streak.

162
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,046
- Yes, there is.

163
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,316
I saw him last night, dad.
I looked right at him.

164
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:13,885
Something incredible
is happening in central city.

165
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,520
And I am gonna write about it.

166
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:17,455
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get to work.

167
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:22,961
Blogging about supernatural
events doesn't really pay well.

168
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,469
- A va file number is all
the info you have on the bomber?

169
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,405
- Ccpd's been ordered
off the case.

170
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:34,873
- Well, who has the power
to do that?

171
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,542
- The army.
Some general.

172
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,544
His name was eiling, I think.

173
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:41,379
- General wade eiling.

174
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,582
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

175
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,483
About ten years ago,
general wade eiling

176
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,152
Contracted S.T.A.R. Labs
to develop

177
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,187
Enhanced gene therapies
for soldiers.

178
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,388
I was interested
in the potential

179
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,223
Medical benefits for civilians.

180
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,359
General eiling really wanted
to develop

181
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,896
Mind reading capabilities
for interrogation purposes.

182
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,965
I stopped the study when I
saw his techniques up close,

183
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:02,567
But our split
was less than amicable.

184
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:04,936
- He took all the evidence
I collected on the bombing.

185
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,105
Everything but the folder.

186
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,941
- Well... Lucky for us,
the va finally

187
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,545
Joined the new millennium
and digitized their records.

188
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,146
A lot of redacted info.

189
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,716
But our girl's name
is bette sans souci,

190
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,718
An eod specialist for the army.

191
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,553
- Eod?
- Bombs.

192
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:22,687
- Is there an address?

193
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,955
- Hold on.
Here, we go.

194
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,057
One person in case of emergency.

195
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,060
Cameron scott.
Inglewood.

196
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:52,083
- Bette sans souci?

197
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:53,118
I need you to come with me.

198
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,421
- Don't touch me.

199
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:58,123
Get whatever you're wearing
off of you.

200
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,259
Hurry.

201
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,975
- Barry, can you hear me?
Barry?

202
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,810
- There must be a perfectly
reasonable explanation

203
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,012
For why he's not answering.

204
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,549
Barry?

205
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,784
Uh...

206
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:28,286
- Don't ask.

207
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,289
- I'm gonna ask.
Where's my suit?

208
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,759
- It's... Gone.

209
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,361
- What do you mean, it's gone?

210
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,762
What did you do with my suit?

211
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,431
- It blew up, dude.

212
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:42,667
I managed to get out of it
before it went, "kaboom."

213
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,170
- My suit went "kaboom"?

214
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:47,038
- Fun fact about
bette sans souci.

215
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,373
She's not carrying bombs.

216
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,874
She touched the emblem
on the suit

217
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,343
And turned it into a bomb.

218
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,878
She's a meta-human.

219
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,147
- With the ability
to cause spontaneous combustion

220
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,650
Upon tactile contact.

221
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,819
- She blew up my suit.
- You have, like, three more.

222
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,722
- Okay, I have two.
And I loved that one.

223
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,323
- All right,
what else do we know about her?

224
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,059
- Oh, I don't know.
She's pure evil.

225
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,527
We're gonna find this girl

226
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,030
And send her butt
into the pipeline.

227
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,698
No one blows my tech
to smithereens

228
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,168
And gets away with it...

229
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,106
Unless she looks like that.

230
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,774
- I don't think
she meant to hurt me.

231
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,242
- Well, her being a meta-human

232
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,178
Explains general eiling's
interest in her.

233
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,748
- And why he stole the case
from us.

234
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,018
He didn't want anyone
to know what she could do.

235
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,420
- Detective.
- Doctor.

236
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,490
So... Human bomb.

237
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:40,058
Must be Tuesday in central city.

238
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,993
- Yes, and general eiling's

239
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:45,163
Not one to give up a potential
asset without a fight.

240
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,931
- We have to find her
before he does.

241
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,834
- Barry?
Can I see you for a second?

242
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,442
When were you planning
on telling me

243
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,110
That iris saw the streak?

244
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,279
- That was not planned.
She caught me off guard.

245
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,148
- We had a deal.

246
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,849
You keep her in the dark
about the meta-humans,

247
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,085
And I don't go floyd mayweather
on you.

248
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,353
- Okay, joe, I know.

249
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:10,255
- And she's writing a blog now.

250
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,656
- I already talked to her
about that.

251
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,826
- Talk to her again.
And be more convincing.

252
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:19,564
- Okay.

253
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:21,266
You mean, right now?
- Yes, I do.

254
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,334
- All right.

255
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,737
You've got
to stop writing about this guy.

256
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,739
He doesn't even exist.
- I saw him, barry.

257
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:30,108
He wears a red suit,
like, a uniform or something,

258
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,744
With a lighting bolt
on his chest.

259
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:34,145
- I mean, iris, come on.

260
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,414
You were drinking last night
at the bar.

261
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,983
- I was not drunk,
and I know what I saw.

262
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,952
He wears a mask.

263
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:44,589
I think he smiled at me.

264
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,292
- Okay, first of all,
if he is wearing a mask,

265
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,427
That probably means he doesn't
want people to know who he is.

266
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,229
- It doesn't matter who he is.

267
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,999
What matters is that people
know that he's out there.

268
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,135
What is wrong with you?
This is important to me.

269
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:59,804
Why can't you be more
supportive?

270
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:03,074
- I'm just... you haven't even
put your name on it.

271
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:07,412
How serious can you be
about an anonymous blog?

272
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,182
- Okay, you know what?
Our entire lives,

273
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,852
You couldn't scream loud enough
that the impossible existed.

274
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,354
And now it's actually happening
in central city.

275
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,724
I have proof of it, and you
don't want to know about it?

276
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,960
That doesn't make sense, barry.

277
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,661
So when you're ready to tell me
what this whole routine

278
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:27,232
Is really about, then we can
talk.

279
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,003
- yeah.

280
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:33,972
- We've piggybacked onto general
eiling's own surveillance.

281
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,707
According to what they're
saying,

282
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,244
The lovely ms. Sans souci
was just spotted in inglewood.

283
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,080
- The same neighborhood
as dr. Harold hadley's office,

284
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:43,381
The military surgeon
who performed

285
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,883
Several procedures on her.

286
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,417
That's why she was looking
for the folder.

287
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,653
- You got to get to her
before eiling does.

288
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,921
- Okay.

289
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,938
- Sgt. Sans souci.
- You remember me.

290
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,608
Good.
Because I remember you, doctor.

291
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,410
I remember waking up
from a coma.

292
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,978
You started cutting me open.

293
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,881
- I was only trying
to help ease your condition.

294
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,249
You couldn't control it.

295
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,886
- You did this to me.
You and eiling.

296
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,372
- Go bring me my asset.

297
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,913
- You okay?

298
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:50,481
Look, I can get you out of here.

299
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,916
I can help you understand
what happened to you.

300
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,252
- How?
- Because it happened to me too.

301
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,054
Please.

302
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:12,837
- Target is gone.

303
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,313
- As the detonation dispersed
throughout central city,

304
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,148
A number of people were exposed
to a wave

305
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,516
Of unquantifiable energy.

306
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:28,319
One of those people... Was you.

307
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,222
You were in central city
ten months ago.

308
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,827
- I had just returned
from afghanistan.

309
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,261
I was there
defusing roadside bombs

310
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,933
And... Shrapnel ripped
through me.

311
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,334
I was flown back state side.

312
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,969
Spent months
at the base recuperating

313
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,506
And next thing I know,

314
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,175
I became the thing that almost
killed me.

315
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:54,512
And eiling's favorite,
new lab rat.

316
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,014
- The dark matter must have
combined

317
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,317
With the bomb particulate
inside your body.

318
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,986
- I thought eiling
did this to me.

319
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:06,924
- Eiling is not smart enough
to create someone like you.

320
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,160
Clever enough to see your value.

321
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,063
- Do you know of any others
who were changed?

322
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,564
- There've been a few.

323
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:18,703
- But no one
that looks like you.

324
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,874
I'm sorry.
That was inappropriate.

325
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,208
Please don't leave.

326
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,178
- I know how to perform
a lobotomy.

327
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,347
- Her cellular structure's
unlike anything I've ever seen.

328
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:32,850
- Her nitrogen levels
are off the charts.

329
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,655
- Do you think we can help her?

330
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:38,923
- To answer that question,
we have to understand

331
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,658
How she works,
and to understand that,

332
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,527
First we have to study her
in action.

333
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,495
- You want her to blow stuff up.

334
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,364
Yes, now we're talking.
- Not in here.

335
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,366
She's too unstable.
- I know.

336
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,734
- I know you know.

337
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,369
- So this is your life now, huh?

338
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,704
Testing people like me?

339
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,441
- Stopping people like you.

340
00:17:56,443 --> 00:18:00,445
It's not what I thought
I'd be doing.

341
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,180
Actually, aside from barry,

342
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:04,849
You're the first meta-human
that we've tested.

343
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:09,787
- "meta-human"?
- It's just a term.

344
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,291
Oh, my god, what happened?

345
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,393
Why didn't you say
that you were shot?

346
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,728
- It just grazed me.

347
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,264
- There's something in there.

348
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:29,474
- A tracker.

349
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,446
- Lock down the pipeline.
Get bette out of here.

350
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,615
I'll take care of eiling.

351
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,991
- Harrison wells.
How the mighty have fallen.

352
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,559
- General.

353
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:51,629
- S.T.A.R. Labs.

354
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,799
This place used to be
so important.

355
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,167
Tell me, what does one do

356
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,669
After such a spectacular,
public failure?

357
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:02,740
- One adapts.
One evolves.

358
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,243
One becomes intent
on reversing one's fortune.

359
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,645
- Always the idealist.

360
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,515
- What do you want, wade?
- Where's my asset?

361
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,183
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

362
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,985
- We tracked her here, harrison.

363
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,586
Turn her over to me
before you see the rest

364
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,188
Of your precious palace crumble.

365
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,758
- Oh, wade, wade, wade.

366
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,733
- We could've changed
the world, you and I.

367
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,147
- 427 kpa's.

368
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:45,249
Her trauzl rating is around 45.

369
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,585
That's the same
as any plastique.

370
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,755
Plastique.
Ha... first try!

371
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,558
- Didn't really think
this one through, did you?

372
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,064
Downrange, insurgents
started booby trapping cars.

373
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,699
The rest of my tour,
I was terrified

374
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:05,503
To touch another vehicle.

375
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,138
Now, I'm gonna spend the rest

376
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,343
Of my life terrified
to touch another human being.

377
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:17,648
Have they tried to help you?

378
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,751
- Yeah, they've helped me learn
how to use my powers.

379
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,587
Not reverse them.

380
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:27,024
- If they could reverse it
so you weren't a meta-human,

381
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:30,294
Would you?

382
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:34,298
- A friend told me I was
given my speed for a reason.

383
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,902
That I was chosen.

384
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,503
I don't know if I believe that,

385
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:43,708
But I always wanted
to help people.

386
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,643
Now I can.

387
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:51,916
Sorry.
Hey, joe.

388
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,253
- I see your little conversation
with iris was a rousing success.

389
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:58,289
She just posted another story
about the streak.

390
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,124
- Joe, I tried.
I really tried.

391
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,059
- She's got her name on it now,
barry.

392
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,028
- What?
Joe...

393
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,863
- It's my fault, I shouldn't
have asked you to say anything.

394
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,064
I just wanted you to know.

395
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,866
Okay?
Bye.

396
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,939
- What was that about?

397
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,575
- Iris posted about the streak
again.

398
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,443
She signed her name to it.

399
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,079
- Oh, that's not good.
- No.

400
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,781
- If one of these bad
meta-humans

401
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,416
We're dealing with
figures she knows something...

402
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:29,086
- Then they may target her,
I know.

403
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,462
- Sorry, we're closed.

404
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,301
- Oh, my god, it's you.

405
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,769
- Iris west,

406
00:21:44,771 --> 00:21:46,171
I hear you've been
writing about me.

407
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,580
- You <i>are</i> real.

408
00:21:56,582 --> 00:22:00,785
I should, um...
Let me just clean up...

409
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:06,657
- Meet me on the roof.

410
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,326
I'll give you a head start.

411
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:21,172
I need you to
stop writing about me.

412
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,873
- There are a lot
of people who need someone

413
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:24,842
Like you right now.

414
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,045
To know that you're out there.

415
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,314
I have so many questions.

416
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:33,017
Where are you from?

417
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,353
- I can't say.

418
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,521
- Who are you?

419
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,291
- I can't tell you that, either.

420
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:44,528
- How can you do what you do?

421
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,434
You're a terrible interview.

422
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,870
- There's more to this
than you can understand.

423
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,638
Just trust me, please.

424
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,475
I need you to stop.

425
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,510
- Can you stop?

426
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:01,479
Running into buildings
and rescuing people

427
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,414
Without them
even knowing that you're there?

428
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,116
- I don't do this for the glory.

429
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,584
- So why do you?

430
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,026
Look, I have this friend,

431
00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:20,931
And he had something terrible
happen to him when he was a kid.

432
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,367
His whole life,
he's been telling stories

433
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:27,171
About this impossible thing.

434
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:32,276
And people laughed at him.
And shrinks analyzed him.

435
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:36,547
And he's been searching
for an explanation ever since.

436
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:41,385
But now, suddenly,
it's like he's lost his faith.

437
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,922
But you... you are proof
that he wasn't crazy.

438
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,662
Help me save my friend.

439
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,702
- He's a lucky guy.

440
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,490
Hey, what's wrong?

441
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,158
Did eiling find out you're here?

442
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,127
- No.

443
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:27,731
Caitlin was about to give me
the not-so-good news.

444
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,934
- The shrapnel in your body

445
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:34,171
Has merged with you
on a cellular level.

446
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:39,844
- And the technology required
to unsplice your dna...

447
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,645
It hasn't been invented yet.

448
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,687
- Bette.

449
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:54,558
- It's okay.
Roger that.

450
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,595
I just need a minute.
Don't worry.

451
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,797
Pretty sure I can cry
without blowing stuff up.

452
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:12,676
- What now?
- She joins us.

453
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,845
Becomes a part of the team.
- Barry...

454
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,182
You have an amazing
ability to help people.

455
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,986
She makes things explode.

456
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,888
- She's the first meta-human
not hell-bent

457
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,256
On destroying this city.

458
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:26,991
- It's too dangerous.

459
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:28,492
- Well, she's not going
in the pipeline.

460
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:29,894
- I'm not suggesting
she go in the pipeline,

461
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,195
But were she to remain
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

462
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:33,497
It would put all of us at risk.

463
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,733
- From who?
Eiling?

464
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,134
- Eiling is a dangerous man,
barry.

465
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:42,006
We do not want him as an enemy.

466
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:45,342
- After the lighting bolt,
what if you hadn't found me?

467
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,077
It could've been me.

468
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:51,882
Hunted, on the run, cut off from
everyone I know and care about.

469
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,517
You guys saved me.

470
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,820
- And I want to save her
just as bad as you do, barry.

471
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,989
We all do.

472
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,801
- Joe.
What are you doing here?

473
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:14,438
- Going over the materials
in your mom's case.

474
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,941
How's it going with you?

475
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:20,311
- Stellar... I made friends
with a human bomb

476
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:24,214
Who I promised I could help,
and then, I couldn't.

477
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:29,820
And I finally diagnosed why iris
is writing about the streak.

478
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,892
She's doing it for me.

479
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:39,029
To prove the impossible
is possible.

480
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,399
- How do you know that?

481
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:44,234
- The streak may have talked
to her.

482
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,638
- Barry, don't you think
iris would recognize your voice?

483
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,407
- No, I can do this cool thing
with my vocal cords,

484
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,278
Where I vibrate them
so I sound like this.

485
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,982
I know.
It's cool, it's cool.

486
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:00,985
- Whoa.

487
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:05,322
Well, you put that
out there now, so.

488
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:09,760
I want to keep her safe.

489
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:11,428
- You know the only real way
to get her to stop

490
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,830
Is to tell her the truth.

491
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:16,500
- Man, you really want
to tell her.

492
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:20,204
- I tell her everything.
- Mm...

493
00:27:20,206 --> 00:27:23,207
Not everything.

494
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,388
- Is it that obvious?

495
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,158
- Not to her.

496
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,927
- But how long
have you known for?

497
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,363
- I have watched
you be in love with iris

498
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:48,866
Since you were old enough
to know what love is.

499
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:53,003
And I've been waiting years
for you to tell her.

500
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:59,276
But you haven't.

501
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,179
- Guess I was too slow.

502
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,882
Now, she's happy
and with someone else, so...

503
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:06,950
- When the universe
wants to make something happen,

504
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:09,853
Whether it be giving a young man
lighting speed

505
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,456
Or putting two people together,

506
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:17,361
It has a way
of figuring those things out.

507
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,763
And I got to get home.

508
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,603
- Thanks.

509
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,247
- Cisco?

510
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,583
- He went home.

511
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:42,920
I think our cisco's developing
a little bit of a crush on you.

512
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:45,923
- Not sure I'm prize winning
date material anymore.

513
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:48,926
- Change is hard.

514
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:52,663
The same accident that changed
you put me in this chair.

515
00:28:52,665 --> 00:28:54,531
- Sorry.
I didn't know.

516
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,101
- I don't share that story
with you to garner sympathy.

517
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,869
I tell it to you
to illustrate a larger point.

518
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:00,404
- And what point is that?

519
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:05,242
- That I would do anything
to get back what I lost.

520
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:11,014
As would you.
- I would.

521
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,583
I just don't know how.

522
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:20,758
- You soldiers, you call
yourselves sheep dogs.

523
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,292
Am I right?

524
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,661
- Happy and normal until someone
attacks our flock.

525
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:26,630
- Every good person
who was changed that night,

526
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:29,333
People like you,
people like barry allen,

527
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:32,636
Those people
are your flock now, bette.

528
00:29:32,638 --> 00:29:36,340
And general eiling will never
stop attacking that flock,

529
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:41,078
And he always gets his target.

530
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,447
Unless you stop him.

531
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,488
You know your duty, sergeant.

532
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,725
Kill eiling.

533
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:58,729
One last mission.
And then you go home.

534
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,147
- Where's bette?

535
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,582
- She left.
- What do you mean?

536
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,584
Where did she go?
- She didn't say.

537
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,719
- Well, where the hell
could she be?

538
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,329
- Go, go!
- Go, go!

539
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,868
- On me.

540
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,308
- I'm ready to give myself up.

541
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:48,011
- Oh, I highly doubt that.

542
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:52,716
You think you can pull one
over on me?

543
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:55,085
You can't.

544
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,386
Stand down, soldier.

545
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:57,855
- I got back
on the military feed.

546
00:30:57,857 --> 00:30:58,989
Looks like they've gone
to the waterfront

547
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,291
To rendezvous with bette.

548
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,126
She's turning herself in.

549
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:05,295
- She's not turning herself in.

550
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,933
- Please, let him get to her
in time.

551
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:13,437
- All over the world, people are
plotting to destroy our country.

552
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,373
To end our lives.

553
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,475
Brave american soldiers
are gonna die in that fight,

554
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,877
But they don't have to.

555
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:23,947
Because of you,
we could have victory.

556
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,884
- All I've ever wanted was
to make the world a safer place.

557
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:29,820
And it will be
when you're not in it.

558
00:31:29,822 --> 00:31:31,455
- Take cover!

559
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,467
- What are you doing here?

560
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,869
- Being a soldier
doesn't mean you're a murderer.

561
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,438
Don't become one now.

562
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,210
I'm sorry.
I didn't see him.

563
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:55,879
- Don't be.
It's not your fault.

564
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:57,314
I'm glad you stopped me.

565
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:58,749
- I'm gonna get you back
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

566
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:04,821
- Barry, dr. Wells.
He... he...

567
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,302
- Guys, we have a problem.

568
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,004
- Is bette okay?

569
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:24,708
- No.
Eiling killed her.

570
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,377
She's glowing.
She's gonna detonate.

571
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,313
- Oh, my god, a mass that size,
the explosion, it would be...

572
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,881
- Devastating.

573
00:32:30,883 --> 00:32:33,383
- Barry, you have to get her
away from the city.

574
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:37,487
- But there's no time.

575
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,957
Can I run on water?

576
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,591
I built up enough speed
to run up a building.

577
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:44,294
How fast do I need to go
to run on water?

578
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,330
- Assuming your weight...

579
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:49,933
450 pounds of force per step
for vertical suspension.

580
00:32:49,935 --> 00:32:51,168
Accounting for fluid drag.

581
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,937
- Approximately 650 miles
an hour.

582
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:59,209
- You have to outrun
the blast or you'll die too.

583
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,263
- Nothing out of the ordinary
occurred.

584
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:27,297
The military was
simply conducting

585
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:30,267
An underwater weapons test.

586
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,569
There is no need
for panic or alarm.

587
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,572
Central city is safe.
I guarantee you.

588
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,809
- He murdered bette right
in front of me.

589
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:40,644
And there's nothing
we can do to him.

590
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:44,681
- Powerful men have a way
of avoiding consequences.

591
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:48,018
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

592
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,986
- You can walk on water.

593
00:34:49,988 --> 00:34:52,956
Puts you in pretty interesting
company.

594
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:11,141
- If you came to do laundry,
I already have a load in.

595
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:14,978
- Uh, no.
I-I came to talk.

596
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,062
I was working a case.

597
00:35:32,064 --> 00:35:35,532
Someone I really thought
I could help befriend.

598
00:35:35,534 --> 00:35:38,502
But they died.

599
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,237
- Barry, I'm really sorry.

600
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:45,041
- I didn't know her that well.
But it still hurts.

601
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:48,378
And as bad as I feel right now,

602
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,383
I know how much worse it is
to lose someone who's family.

603
00:35:55,186 --> 00:36:00,223
Iris... Writing about this stuff,
putting your name out there,

604
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,359
It's dangerous.

605
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:08,131
So I'm asking you one last time,
please, stop.

606
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,600
- And I am asking you
one last time

607
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:14,404
To tell me what is really
going on with you.

608
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:18,408
Why am I the only one of us
who's interested in this?

609
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:34,057
- I guess, just,
all this stuff with my family,

610
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:39,095
I finally just put it behind me.

611
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:44,034
I'm asking you to also.

612
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:45,869
- That may have been
how this started,

613
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,706
But it's about something more
than that for me now.

614
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,543
Whoever this streak is,
wherever he comes from,

615
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:57,714
I am not stopping until the rest
of the world believes in him.

616
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,294
- Maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a while.

617
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,168
- Yeah.

618
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:38,855
Can I get another club
soda, please?

619
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,528
- Hey.

620
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,464
- Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

621
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,933
- We thought we
should have a toast.

622
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,935
- Doesn't work on me, remember?

623
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,703
- Barry allen, you of all people

624
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:57,340
Should know
that nothing is impossible.

625
00:37:57,342 --> 00:38:01,444
I distilled a highly fermented,
potent suspension.

626
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,947
It's basically 500 proof.

627
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:08,451
I figured if anybody could use
a drink tonight, it was you.

628
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,053
So here's to bette.

629
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,392
- Bette.

630
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:22,999
Whoa, oh.

631
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,734
That hit too quick.

632
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:27,103
- Are you buzzed?

633
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:30,840
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm buzzed for sure.

634
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:35,245
Whoa.
Whoa, that is good stuff.

635
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,083
And it's gone.

636
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,851
- Work in progress.

637
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:45,221
- For a guy who has experienced
his fair share of mysteries,

638
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,190
One mystery
I still can't figure out

639
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:50,226
Is why some people
come into our lives.

640
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,028
Why some people go,

641
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,564
And others become a part of you.

642
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:58,201
Some friendships
feel like they'll last forever.

643
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:00,236
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Hey.

644
00:39:00,238 --> 00:39:03,440
There's dinner in the fridge.

645
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:04,974
- Okay, thanks.

646
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,343
Iris, about your blog...

647
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,411
- I don't want
to talk about it, okay?

648
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:12,248
- And others end far too soon.

649
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,919
Not every friendship
is meant to last a lifetime.

650
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:21,324
What does last forever is the
pain when that person is gone.

651
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,814
- I was wrong about you,
harrison.

652
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,117
You're still one step ahead.

653
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,520
Impressive for a man
without the use of his legs.

654
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:53,123
- I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about, wade.

655
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,091
- A girl who can transform
ordinary objects

656
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,594
Into explosives with the touch
of her hand.

657
00:39:57,596 --> 00:40:00,597
Today I saw a man who can move
faster than the blink of an eye.

658
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,499
Extraordinary.

659
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:05,168
The night your particle
accelerator died

660
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,504
Was the night
the impossible was born.

661
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:10,240
I think we should start working
together again, harrison.

662
00:40:10,242 --> 00:40:11,841
- I think you should leave.

663
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,476
- You know, I can have
a squadron of soldiers here

664
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:15,111
In minutes.

665
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,980
- You know, I can have an army
of press here like that.

666
00:40:16,982 --> 00:40:18,915
Believe me, general,
I'd be more than happy

667
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,350
To testify to your involvement

668
00:40:20,352 --> 00:40:24,854
In activities
that were less than humane.

669
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:27,824
Threaten me again
and I will end you, general.

670
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:31,294
And I am not talking
about your career.

671
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:39,736
- You know, I figured out
your little secret, wells.

672
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,305
Won't be long before the public
catches on as well.

673
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,454
This is everything
we've been working to achieve.

674
00:40:57,456 --> 00:41:00,657
- We may have the same goals,
general, but not the same means.

675
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,960
- I will not have this project
end before it even begins.

676
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,296
- And as long
as he's on my premises,

677
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:09,299
I will not have him subjected
to that kind of cruelty anymore.

678
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:12,735
We're done.

679
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:17,040
We're done.
General.

680
00:41:17,042 --> 00:41:20,310
Get out.

681
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,665
Hey.

682
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,568
It's okay.

683
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,036
- It's okay, boy.

684
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:49,205
It's okay.

685
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:51,508
- He's gone.

686
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:54,844
Don't you worry.

687
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,847
I have a whole different future
in mind for you.

688
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,810
- Greg, move your head.
