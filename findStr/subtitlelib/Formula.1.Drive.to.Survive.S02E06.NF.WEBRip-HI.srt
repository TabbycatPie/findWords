1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,080
[Pierre] Is this about my seat?

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,000
[producer] Yes.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,280
[Pierre] I wanna know
that you guys say the truth or not, so...

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,640
[producer] Yeah.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,120
That's why I just asked you
to know in which way it's being said.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,420
[Pierre] I lost it.

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,420
[Christian] <i>The situation with Pierre,</i>

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,080
<i>it's frustrating 'cause I really feel</i>

9
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,380
<i>that we've got a car
that could beat Ferrari this year.</i>

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,160
But we've been running one-legged.

11
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,680
[Pierre] Fuck! Fucking hell.

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,740
No!

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,920
[Christian] <i>Finishing seventh or eighth
or ninth has no value to us,</i>

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,280
so we decided to release Pierre
from the Red Bull Racing seat.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,980
At the end of the day, if you can't cope
with the pressure and scrutiny,

16
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,760
you're never gonna make it
at the highest level in Formula 1.

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,000
[Alexander Albon] <i>Truthfully,
not many people get the opportunity</i>

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,540
<i>to pursue a career in Formula 1.</i>

19
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,600
[praying in Thai]

20
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,956
[Alexander in English] <i>It's an expensive
sport from the beginning,</i>

21
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,480
<i>so, being a rookie,
I feel very lucky to be where I am.</i>

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,920
My name is Alexander Albon. I'm 23,
and I race for Scuderia Toro Rosso.

23
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,200
<i>I've got four siblings.</i>

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,480
<i>We're very close, so a big family.</i>

25
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,920
<i>My mom's Thai. Dad is British.</i>

26
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,880
<i>My dad lives in Malaysia now,
so I don't really see him that much.</i>

27
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,280
<i>But he comes to Silverstone, always.</i>

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,800
<i>You can only be one nationality
in motorsports,</i>

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,780
<i>so I did choose the Thai racing license.</i>

30
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,476
- [monk] Can I take a picture?
- [Alexander] Of course.

31
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,240
[monk] I just shared you on my story.

32
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
[Alexander laughs]

33
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,800
[Alexander] <i>My mom, she's been my number
one supporter from day one.</i>

34
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,460
[Minki] <i>When things were tough,
really tough, last year,</i>

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,480
I came here and, you know, we pray

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,480
and, uh, we asked for things
to change for Alex.

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,080
[Sophie] I'm making it really
good for you, don't worry.

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Cool.

39
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,780
Let's go. Shall we go?

40
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,820
[Minki] Yes.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,820
[Minki] <i>Alex is the head of the family.</i>

42
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,760
<i>The younger ones look up to him.
You know, ask for his opinion a lot.</i>

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,520
<i>So, he's very important to us.</i>

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,120
[Alexander] This is a Buddhist school.

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,840
I kind of wish I did it.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,920
But my mum didn't take us to school.

47
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,760
Instead, she's busy
taking Instagram videos.

48
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,880
[all laughing]

49
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,320
[Alexander] Zoe, can you take this?

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,600
[Minki] That was a fluke.

51
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,360
Did you guys get that?

52
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
[laughing]

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,820
[Alexander] Is my phone here?

54
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,120
[indistinct chatter]

55
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,116
[Sophie] I'm going to paint my nails.

56
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,540
I live with my four siblings and my mum.

57
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,240
We rent this place, so it is quite small.

58
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,700
It will be a very short tour,
but, yeah, this is pretty much it.

59
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,300
- So, living room.
- [Sophie] That's the dining room.

60
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,580
Dining room. [laughs]

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,720
I have a bit of my trophies.

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,520
This one is from the World Championship.

63
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
There's a photo going around now,
of Max and I, in karting.

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,420
<i>That's when I won the World Championship.</i>

65
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,340
Basically, Max, Pierre,

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,240
<i>Esteban Ocon,</i>

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,820
<i>even Charles,
we were all racing in the same year.</i>

68
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,076
[Alexander]<i> We'd grown up together,
but that's not to tell you</i>

69
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,380
<i>when we put on our helmets,
we're nice to each other.</i>

70
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,520
I guess, in a way, good reminder
of where we've come from.

71
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,780
<i>Take it back 12 months ago,
I was in Formula 2.</i>

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,140
[Alex Jacques] <i>This is wall-to-wall drama,
the Formula 2 championship.</i>

73
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,380
[Alexander] <i>Formula 2 is very serious
for young drivers.</i>

74
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,160
<i>It's our way
to basically get into Formula 1.</i>

75
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,340
Formula 2 is the support race
for Formula 1.

76
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,680
<i>We race on the same tracks
and on the same weekend as Formula 1,</i>

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,220
<i>so the Formula 1 teams watch the race.</i>

78
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,580
<i>They see how you're doing.</i>

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,080
Guys who have been dominating tend to get
the opportunities in Formula 1.

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,680
<i>I went into that year
fighting for the championship.</i>

81
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,280
[Alex Jacques] <i>Alexander Albon

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,580
[Rosamma] <i>What an incredible race.</i>

83
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,020
Yeah, um...

84
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,100
Been a really tough couple of years.

87
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,060
[Alexander] <i>At the end of that year,
I came out third</i>

88
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,700
<i>and I didn't really have a team,</i>

89
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,860
<i>so I thought that was it.</i>

90
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,060
[all cheering]

91
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,220
[Alexander]<i> And then suddenly,</i>

92
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,400
<i>everything changed.</i>

93
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,200
[engine accelerating]

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,060
[Alexander] <i>I got the call up
for Toro Rosso.</i>

95
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,040
<i>It was a shock.</i>

96
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,040
[Helmut] <i>Since last year,
we've been watching Alex Albon.</i>

97
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,620
My name is Helmut Marko.
I work for Red Bull.

98
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,680
<i>Red Bull have two Formula 1 teams,
Red Bull Racing and then Toro Rosso.</i>

99
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,540
<i>We are trying
to give young people a chance.</i>

100
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,960
<i>That's part of the Red Bull philosophy.</i>

101
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,880
<i>And that's why we took Albon
to Toro Rosso.</i>

102
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,380
[David] <i>Alex Albon from pitlane to ten.
Didn't he do well?</i>

103
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,800
Immediately, he jumped in
and he did three very good races.

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,760
[Alex Jacques] <i>Here's Alexander Albon
on Pierre Gasly.</i>

105
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,160
<i>Gasly can't fight back.</i>

106
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
<i>Super move.</i>

107
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,260
[Alexander] <i>The first thing
they care about is if you're fast enough.</i>

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,620
<i>Of course, I'm wary that there isn't
that much time given to a driver</i>

109
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,600
<i>to showcase his abilities.</i>

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,740
[David] <i>Sparks flying.
Someone's got some damage.</i>

111
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,280
<i>Albon in the thick of it.</i>

112
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,960
[Alexander] <i>There's always a feeling
of expectation and pressure.</i>

113
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,980
[David] <i>Here comes Albon,
round the outside of Gasly.</i>

114
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,020
<i>Good stuff.</i>

115
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,996
[Alexander] <i>There's only 20 of us,</i>

116
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,580
<i>so you never know the next big talent
to come in the sport.</i>

117
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,340
<i>You never know the next rich person
to come into the sport.</i>

118
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,200
You know it could always be
your last opportunity.

119
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,080
<i>That's part of the game.</i>

120
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,660
[Christian] <i>Here at Red Bull,
Pierre Gasly has been our Achilles' heel.</i>

121
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,900
Now, at this point,

122
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,960
we need a driver that can deliver
and not make mistakes.

123
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,700
<i>A driver that's got
tremendous self-assurance,</i>

124
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,040
<i>a driver that will say,
"Fuck it, I'm going for it.</i>

125
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,820
<i>This is who I am."</i>

126
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,120
<i>Bang.</i>

127
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
<i>Deliver.</i>

128
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,740
<i>We'll give Alex Albon a run
for the remaining nine races.</i>

129
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,980
We're gonna put you in situ,

130
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,720
so we just have to shoot you
in a similar pose

131
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,120
because we're gonna remove that subject
and put you in place, basically.

132
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Okay.

133
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,640
[Christian] <i>The decision was made
with Alex Albon</i>

134
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,700
<i>to promote him as the logical candidate
within the Red Bull program.</i>

135
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,700
So, you can smile even more.

136
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
Okay, good.

137
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,140
Alex has got nine races to demonstrate
that he's got the right qualities

138
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,560
to be a Red Bull Racing driver.

139
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,900
<i>Saying, "Okay,
if you do a good enough job,</i>

140
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,040
<i>the seat is yours in 2020."</i>

141
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,740
But he will need to be able to deal
with the pressure that goes with that.

142
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,600
[Alexander] <i>Feeling right now,
obviously, a lot of excitement.</i>

143
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,120
<i>I would be lying if I said
there wasn't a bit of nerves as well.</i>

144
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
<i>It's really cool.</i>

145
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,560
It's like an F1 car on steroids.

146
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,080
<i>Now I've stepped up to the big team,
of course, there comes expectation.</i>

147
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,100
<i>With Pierre, you can't really feel sorry
for people in Formula 1.</i>

148
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,956
<i>When you do get the chance,
you really have to make the most of it.</i>

149
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,340
<i>You have to be selfish.</i>

150
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,100
I've been given this opportunity,

151
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,700
but trying not to get too flustered
by it all.

152
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,880
<i>Thinking about it now,
12 months ago, I was fighting for a seat</i>

153
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,460
<i>and now I'm here, it's a bit crazy.</i>

154
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,860
- [Alexander] How are you?
- [man] So happy for you.

155
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,120
[Simon] <i>Alex Albon,

157
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,100
[fan] Congrats, Alex.

158
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
[Will] Pierre,
did you get any advance warning?

159
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,940
Well, of course. Um, uh...

160
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,420
I gather you're surprised by the decision,
but do you believe it was a fair one?

161
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,480
Um...

162
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,440
[reporter 1 speaking in French]

163
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,016
[reporter 2 in English] Do you feel
you have been treated in a fair way?

164
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,520
The thing is, there are many things,
but that should stay internally

165
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,816
and I don't really want to talk about it.

166
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,720
[camera shutters clicking]

167
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,860
Coming into Spa, there are a lot of talks
and there is a lot of trash talk as well.

168
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,040
<i>I've just stopped listening to all this.</i>

169
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
<i>I'm just focusing on myself,</i>

170
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,220
<i>making sure
that I deliver the best performance I can,</i>

171
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,220
and, yeah,
still developing myself as a driver.

172
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,700
<i>But when you lose your seat,</i>

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
<i>it's difficult.</i>

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,000
[producer] Any advice for Alex Albon?

175
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,120
[chuckles]

176
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,940
I think he's smart enough
to find out by himself.

177
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,536
- [Jonathan] How are you?
- [Alexander] Yeah, not too bad, thank you.

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,020
[Jonathan] Congratulations
on your elevation.

179
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,400
Cheers, thank you, yeah.

180
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,400
I just want to say this,
absolutely at the start,

181
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,560
that probably anyone in the next week
who writes something

182
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,500
- in a national British newspaper...
- Yeah.

183
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,700
...will make mention of that thing.

184
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,160
- Yeah, I know.
- What I'm saying to you is

185
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,360
tell me as little or as much as you want
and I will deal with it as well as I can.

186
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,380
But mainly this is an interview
about racing.

187
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,560
That's what we accepted
on our understanding.

188
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,860
Oh. Right.

189
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,640
I would suggest
that we work together on it.

190
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,760
This isn't going to be a one-to-one
about Alex's mom.

191
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
I can tell you that now.

192
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,260
[Jonathan] No,
there'll be an element of that.

193
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,480
I'm not trying
to cause a bother here.

194
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

195
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,840
[Jonathan] I've got a job to do.
That's what I'd like to do.

196
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,120
Do that another day, then.

197
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,440
- [Jacques] Right.
- [Jonathan] Thank you.

198
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,216
- [Alexander] Cheers, guys.
- [woman] Thank you very much.

199
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
[Alexander] <i>See you.</i>

200
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,940
<i>The media love to find some stuff.</i>

201
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,920
<i>If you don't know the story, 2012,</i>

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,940
<i>that year was by far the hardest year
I've had in my life.</i>

203
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,800
Even now, I don't like talking about it,
to be honest, 'cause it's...

204
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,320
<i>It's more I want to ask my mom
if she wants to speak about it.</i>

205
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,960
[Minki] <i>Alex, he's been through a lot.</i>

206
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,240
<i>There was a time, a long time ago now,
that I wasn't with the children.</i>

207
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,340
[newsreader 1] <i>Minki Albon,
jailed for fraud.</i>

208
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,320
[newsreader 2] <i>Kankamol Albon,
jailed for six years in October...</i>

209
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,340
It was a tough period, obviously.
I was in court.

210
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,220
I kind of saw everything happen.

211
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,160
Saw her get locked up and taken away.

212
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Yeah.

213
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,200
I need to pray.

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,080
[Minki] <i>Yes, I did wrong.</i>

215
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,660
<i>I've paid for what I've done
and Alex has forgiven me.</i>

216
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,280
She was in and then she got out mid-2015.

217
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,580
So, it was a tough period.

218
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,540
<i>I was 15 at that time
and I was the man of the house,</i>

219
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,440
looking after my siblings
and all that kind of thing,

220
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,760
when... We call it,
"When she was on her holiday."

221
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,680
<i>I was a Red Bull Junior driver back then.</i>

222
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,040
<i>But I was a bit of a lost sheep.</i>

223
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,056
<i>Just having to deal
with the pressures of family life</i>

224
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,860
<i>as well as actual racing life.</i>

225
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,080
<i>Just kind of going to races,
I didn't really have the right mindset.</i>

226
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,620
<i>And then I got dropped.</i>

227
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,460
<i>To be honest,
the results weren't good enough</i>

228
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,620
and that was that, which kind of...

229
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,940
Yeah, I saw it coming.

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,840
<i>Then, obviously, to be dropped,
it's kind of like a big bomb,</i>

231
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,580
<i>where you just think,
"What are we going to do now?"</i>

232
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
Didn't have any money, of course.

233
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,340
<i>But I did have my Thai heritage.</i>

234
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,200
<i>So we found some sponsors in Thailand.</i>

235
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,760
How did you feel the ThaiBev
was support you about the race?

236
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,420
Uh, I'm really privileged,
I'm really thankful,

237
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,000
<i>now they're supporting me this year.</i>

238
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,176
[Alexander] <i>That was really the only way
I could ever have got back into racing.</i>

239
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
<i>Two years after everything happened,</i>

240
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,920
the results started to suddenly come

241
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
and I started to get podiums,
started to win races.

242
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,940
<i>I think that's where, 2012,
it made me a lot hungrier.</i>

243
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,400
<i>I realized how much I wanted it afterwards</i>

244
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,120
because it got taken away from me,
the chance of Formula 1.

245
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,420
[trainer] Three, two, one.

246
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,396
[commentator] <i>We're ready, we're set.</i>

247
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,000
<i>It's qualifying
for the 2019 Belgian Grand Prix.</i>

248
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,800
<i>Twelve races with Toro Rosso,</i>

249
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,180
<i>and promoted to Red Bull
to become their 11th driver.</i>

250
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,540
[Martin] <i>Over the winter,
he was nowhere near a Formula 1 car,</i>

251
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,060
<i>and then he got in the Toro Rosso.
Now, he's in a Red Bull.</i>

252
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,040
[Alexander] <i>My mom, we're very close.</i>

253
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,660
<i>That's why
I always have my family with me.</i>

254
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,900
<i>It makes everything feel normal.</i>

255
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,160
<i>You're with the people
you've been with the whole time.</i>

256
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,740
<i>Because really, I wouldn't be driving
if it wasn't for them.</i>

257
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,440
<i>So, this transition to Red Bull,
it is a big deal for all of us.</i>

258
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,680
<i>And then, during the race weekend,
there's a lot of people.</i>

259
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,300
[press] Alex!

260
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
[indistinct chatter]

261
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,276
[Alexander] <i>And there's a big atmosphere.</i>

262
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,580
[all cheering]

263
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,240
[Alexander] <i>The pressure around you
starts to get very intense.</i>

264
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,580
<i>Before each session,
I quickly do a meditation.</i>

265
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,160
<i>The reason I meditate,</i>

266
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,180
it's that feeling of getting away
from Formula 1 a little bit.

267
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,040
<i>It's really good for clearing your mind.</i>

268
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,460
<i>You feel your whole body from head to toe.</i>

269
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,420
<i>And then, at that point...</i>

270
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,100
[engine revs]

271
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,420
<i>I do a lot of imagining the track,</i>

272
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,600
<i>envisioning what I need to do
to be my best,</i>

273
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,880
<i>so I'm as prepared as possible.</i>

274
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,600
[engine roaring]

275
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,960
[Alexander] <i>Reset and then go.</i>

276
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,040
[Christian] Okay, mate, have a good one.

277
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,520
There's no pressure on this at all,
so just enjoy it,

278
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,540
see what the car's like on the low fuel.

279
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,580
Okay.

280
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,480
[David] <i>On board with Alex Albon,</i>

281
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,180
<i>the sixth driver to be promoted
from Toro Rosso</i>

282
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,340
<i>and easily the least experienced.</i>

283
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
<i>Good job.</i>

284
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
<i>Keep pushing.</i>

285
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,000
[David] <i>Albon now crosses the line.</i>

286
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,020
[engineer] <i>Excellent, Alex.</i>

287
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,080
<i>Considering your preparation,
you're only three-tenths off Hamilton.</i>

288
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,000
[Christian] <i>Well done, Alex.
That was a good job.</i>

289
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,840
<i>The performance he put in
was mightily impressive,</i>

290
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
<i>but, unfortunately,
we've taken an engine penalty</i>

291
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,420
<i>and so, Alex, he'll be starting
at the back of the grid.</i>

292
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,516
[Alex Jacques] <i>Good afternoon.
You're watching Formula 2</i>

293
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:44,320
<i>right here, right now,
in front of a huge crowd in Belgium.</i>

294
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,416
[reporter] <i>How much are you
looking forward to tomorrow?</i>

295
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,880
Obviously, points woummld be the main aim.

296
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,000
Something out of your control happens,
a yellow flag...

297
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,276
It's different. No, it's just different...

298
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,140
[crashing]

299
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,756
- [Alex Jacques]<i> There's a big crash there.</i>
- Holy jeez.

300
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,696
[Alex Jacques] <i>There's a car,
who's lost it on the way...</i>

301
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
<i>Oh, no.</i>

302
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,220
Oh, wow.

304
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,400
[Alex Jacques] <i>That's a horrible accident.</i>

305
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,240
Jeez, I hope that kid's good.

306
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,400
Okay, um...

307
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Wow.

308
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,940
That's terrifying.

309
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
Um...

310
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,120
[Chloe] Oh, my God.

311
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,120
Who was that?

312
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,680
Uh, we're just trying to see who it was.

313
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,800
[Minki] Oh, my God.

314
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,856
- [Minki] Isn't that Nick?
- [Chloe] Oh, my God, it's Correa.

315
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,060
[Minki] And Hubert.

316
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,160
[Chloe] Oh, my God.

317
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Alex is good friends with him.

[siren wailing]

319
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,440
[Minki] Look. The ambulance.

320
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,940
The crash is there,
so they're probably getting...

321
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,536
[Alex Jacques] <i>We can confirm to you</i>

322
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,600
<i>that it's Anthoine Hubert
and Juan Manuel Correa</i>

00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,860
<i>who were involved in the crash.</i>

324
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,360
I've never seen an accident that bad.

325
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,220
[Alex Jacques] <i>We have a red flag</i>

326
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,780
<i>and the race suspended
after a very violent accident.</i>

327
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,920
<i>The medical car has been deployed
to the top of the hill.</i>

328
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
<i>And we keep our fingers crossed

I was in the paddock.</i>

361

<i>Straightaway, I understood,

362
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,140
I said, "Something really bad
must have happened."

363
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,040
<i>And at that time, I didn't understand
which drivers were involved.</i>

364

<i>I just saw my parents.
They were completely broken, in tears,</i>

<i>and yeah, they told me
that Anthoine had passed away.</i>

366

<i>I've grown up with him

376
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,520
If I think about all these years,

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,280
I've been growing

378
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,500

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,916

- [Alexander] Hey, Christian.

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,756
- [Alexander] You okay?
- [Christian] Yeah, good. You all right?

382
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,760
Yeah, I'm okay, mate.

383
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,280
I think you had a tough one last night,
I'm sure.

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Yeah.

385
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,700
But, you know, he was doing what he loved.

386
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,400
Honestly, last night,
it was really bad sleep.

387
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,760
- Yeah.
- I don't know...

388
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,580
Normally, I really don't...

389
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,160
[Christian] I slept about
two hours last night.

390
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,440
Yeah.

391
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,720
But you know what?

392
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,160
He would have given his right arm
to be in your position.

393
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Yeah.

394
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,960
- Yeah.
- Give it everything.

395
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,560

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,520

<i>For us lot, for the drivers,</i>

When you race at 300 kph,
it's just dangerous,

<i>and it will always remain
a dangerous sport,</i>

447
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,680

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,120
[clapping and cheering]

493
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,640
[engineer 2] <i>You are doing great, Alex.
Well done.</i>

494
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,280
<i>Next car, Pérez.</i>

495
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,700
[David] <i>Whether he can catch Sergio Pérez
by the end of the race...</i>

496
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,740
<i>It's gonna be tough.</i>

497
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,380
[engineer 2] <i>Pérez, nine seconds in front.</i>

498
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,700
<i>Nine laps to go.</i>

499
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,620
<i>Keep pushing.</i>

500
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,560
<i>Six laps to go.</i>

501
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,060
<i>Four laps to go.</i>

502
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,700
[David] <i>That gap now between
Albon and Pérez just four seconds.</i>

503
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,920
[engineer 2] <i>Keep pushing.</i>

504
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,840
<i>Three laps to go.</i>

505
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,140
<i>Two laps to go.</i>

506
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,280
[David] <i>The gap is now down
to 1.7 seconds.</i>

507
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,140
[Martin] <i>This could go down
to the very last chicane of the race.</i>

508
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,680
[crowd cheering]

509
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,800
[David] <i>Up to the fastest point
on the circuit,</i>

510
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,260
<i>Albon sensed a dummy.</i>

511
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,580
<i>And he's through!</i>

512
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,300
[both cheering]

513
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:08,080
[David] <i>And Alex Albon is on his way home
to take fifth place in this race.</i>

514
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,640
[applauding]

515
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,800
[engineer 2]<i> P5.</i>

516
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,260
<i>Excellent work, Alex. Thumbs up, mate.</i>

517
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,660
[Alexander] <i>That was
a really good job, guys.</i>

518
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,540
[David] <i>Here comes Gasly across the line</i>

519
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,580
<i>to take home a couple of points
this afternoon.</i>

520
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,680
[engineer 1] <i>P9, Pierre, P9.
Beautiful race.</i>

521
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,200
[David] <i>Gasly will be pleased with that.</i>

522
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,420
<i>For Alex Albon, that's a career-best
finish for him on his Red Bull debut.</i>

523
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,660
[Christian] <i>Well done, Alex.</i>

524
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,500
<i>Really very good.
P5 from the back of the grid. Well done.</i>

525
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,140
[Alexander] Yeah, thank you.

526
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,060
Still some work to do, though, for sure.

527
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,096
[Alexander] <i>I think they see
potential in me,</i>

528
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,620
<i>but this doesn't mean
that I have the seat for next year.</i>

529
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,460
<i>This is more of a test, really.</i>

530
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,820
And, yeah, we'll give it a go, we'll see.

531
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,520
[Christian] <i>I think Alex,
he's just stepped it up.</i>

532
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:10,780
And the relationship
could not have got off to a better start.

533
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,920
[Smith] Well done, mate. That was mighty.

534
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Well done.

535
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,040
[Christian] <i>And it just injected
a whole bunch of motivation</i>

536
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,720
<i>into Red Bull Racing.</i>

537
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,080
<i>He needs to be within three or four tenths
of Max by the end of the year</i>

538
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,300
to be the right guy to be alongside him
for 2020.

539
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,620
[David] <i>It's difficult to put into words
the emotions around Spa today.</i>

540
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,900
<i>It's a weekend where the devastating low</i>

541
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,740
<i>of the death of the young F2 racer
and rising star Anthoine Hubert</i>

542
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,780
<i>has served to remind us all once again,</i>

543
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,880
<i>the risks taken to seek
the rewards in motorsport.</i>

544
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,136
[engineer 1] <i>You've done
a very good job today, Pierre,</i>

545
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,020
<i>very good job.</i>

546
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,100
<i>You should be proud.</i>

547
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,140
<i>[Pierre] Thanks, guys.</i>

548
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,480
Only a couple of points,

549
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,360
<i>but I'm happy to score it
for my friend, Anthoine.</i>

550
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
[engineer 1] <i>Copy that.</i>

551
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,460
[Pierre] <i>Whether you knew
Anthoine or not,</i>

552
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:14,580
everybody in motorsport
has been impacted in some way.

553
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,480
It was very tough and it was
a big shock to everyone, I think.

554
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,860
<i>It is strange. I think I've been racing
these guys since I was 13.</i>

555
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,120
<i>In the end,
you spend so much time together,</i>

556
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,620
<i>you have the same interests,
you have the same dilemmas.</i>

557
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,960
<i>When you're amongst these guys,
you feel like family.</i>

558
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,080
<i>And family is number one.</i>

559
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,556
[Pierre] <i>Whether you are in Formula 1</i>

560
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,540
<i>or whether it's Formula 4
or it's Formula 2,</i>

561
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,600
<i>you know, it's like we are all brothers
in this world.</i>

562
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,260
<i>When you lose one of your brothers,</i>

563
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,640
<i>you feel the need to enjoy life
and enjoy racing and Formula 1</i>

564
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,480
<i>as much as he would have liked.</i>

565
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,440
These things happen to remind it to us.

566
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,540
You can occasionally kiss if you want.

567
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,640
[laughing]

568
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,920
[man 1] Start by holding hands.

569
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,360
- Can you win this weekend?
- Yeah!

570
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,660
- [man 2]<i> Vettel's undercut him.</i>
- [Charles] What the hell?

571
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,340
[man 4] <i>Oh, no! What's happened there?</i>

572
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,420
We can start drinking now.
It's five o'clock somewhere.

573
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,600
Nico!

574
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,680
Hulkenberg!

575
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,760
[laughing]

576
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,100
You are acting as a shrink for our couple.

577
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,296
[Alexander] <i>This is where I'm gonna have
my single life.</i>

578
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,000
[man 5]<i> It's very hard
to keep up with him.</i>

579
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,660
[Max] This is the best day of my life.
