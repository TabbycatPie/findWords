1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,160
Previously on Legacies...

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,370
If I return the knife to Malivore, I will be free.

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,120
What's Malivore?

4
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,380
It's a hell dimension that consumes creatures

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,040
and wipes their existence from the collective conscience.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,550
ALARIC:  Yesterday I came  into possession

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,000
of another Malivore artifact.

8
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,500
Now monsters  that shouldn't exist

9
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,000
have been coming after it.

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,500
How long do you think it'll be

11
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:20,960
before the next monster shows up?

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,720
Do you think I'm broken? Of course not.

13
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,140
I think your  biological mother's

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,260
crazy-ass witch ancestors  left you

15
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,400
with a legacy of darkness that you have to work through.

16
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,230
I don't ever want to hurt anybody.

17
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,720
I'm here now to help.

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,920
LIZZIE: I'm surprised  that you have time

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
with all of the private training sessions

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,610
you've been doing  with Hope Mikaelson.

21
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,450
Speak of the actual devil.

22
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,530
You sure it glowed again?

23
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,320
I sleep with the damn thing under my pillow..

24
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,830
It's hard to miss.

25
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,990
What do you think it's gonna be this time?

26
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,250
Hmm? Cyclops?

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,000
Slender Man? Santa?

28
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,540
Well, given our luck, I think it's safe

29
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,750
to rule out Ol' Saint Nick. I don't know.

30
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,210
I mean, Santa Claus is kind of terrifying

31
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,510
when you think about it.

32
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:02,760
Breaks into your home.

33
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,130
He sees you when you're sleeping.

34
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,770
Not to mention, judge-y.

35
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,680
Hope, I need you to focus. Look, I'm trying.

36
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,940
I just wish that Satan's nightlight

37
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,720
would give us some rest. Yeah.

38
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,180
And I wish that knife was never in our school to begin with,

39
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,190
but it's not like we can change that now.

40
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,940
All we can do is make sure we're not blindsided

41
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,940
by another monster waltzing through our doors.

42
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,690
Too late.

43
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,780
Oh, God.

44
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,200
Uh, girls. What are you doing here?

45
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,860
You're not supposed to get in until tonight.

46
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,960
Mom was able to get us direct into Dulles.

47
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,130
Then faxed, texted and e-mailed you

48
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,790
our revised itinerary. ALARIC: I am so sorry.

49
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,620
It's-it's chaos around here.

50
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,880
It's okay, Dad.

51
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,750
We know that you're overwhelmed.

52
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,590
But Europe was amazing.

53
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,640
And seeing Mom was really good.

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,840
LIZZIE: Jo's covered the bright side.

55
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,590
Far less sunny was waiting for you

56
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,140
in the chilly dark of morning at the terminal

57
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,600
and you not showing up.

58
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,480
In his defense,

59
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,890
um, we've been in crisis mode around here.

60
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,150
Oh, we've heard all about it.

61
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,980
Hope got bamboozled by one of the monsters

62
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,440
and now only two keys separate

63
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,990
the entire supernatural community

64
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,070
from being consumed by a hell portal.

65
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,790
I'm guessing that weird little vase is one of them?

66
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,610
It's an urn, actually.

67
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,170
I don't care what it is.

68
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,120
I care that instead of being welcomed at the airport,

69
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,120
we were forced to take

70
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,170
a three-hour shuttle ride that smelled like an open sewer.

71
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,250
And feet.

72
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,750
Thanks a lot, Hope.

73
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,090
Way to ruin life for the rest of us.

74
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,100
Breathe.

75
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,640
Just breathe.

76
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,140
Come on, you beautiful beast.

77
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,700
Say the magic words.

78
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,450
I wish Hope had never come to this school.

79
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,240
Where did you come from?

80
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,620
Mm. First things first. I'm... Blue.

81
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,530
Y-You're so blue.

82
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,000
My name is Ablah.

83
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,540
And you're obviously a monster.

84
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,290
Would a monster grant your wish?

85
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,590
Holy crap.

86
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,220
You're a freaking genie.

87
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,170
Hmm. Jinni.

88
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,680
And your wish is my command.

89
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,650
ALARIC: Elizabeth.

90
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,910
Rise and shine.

91
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,660
What, you taking the day off, Lizzie B?

92
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,250
Dad, what time is it? I had the weirdest dre...

93
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,760
What happened to your face?

94
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,410
Quit stalling.

95
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,540
It's time... for fight training.

96
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,420
Pass. I'm not really in the mood

97
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,710
to watch Hope be a ninja today, Dad.

98
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,680
: Who?

99
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,770
Never mind.

100
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,720
All right. Well, come on. Josie's down at the dock.

101
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,440
Come on. Let's go.

102
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,730
Get out of bed.

103
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,620
La, la, la, la-la-la, la, la

104
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,120
It's what I need

105
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,690
Yes, I'm ready for one, two, three

106
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,400
Give me what I want

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,820
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

108
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,540
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

109
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,030
Give me what I want

110
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,410
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh...

111
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,910
I'm so good at this. How am I so good?

112
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,370
Quit bragging. You're losing.

113
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,370
Lizzie, go high.

114
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,090
You always give me what I want...

115
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,920
I'm really proud of you guys.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,590
Help your old man up.

117
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,880
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah.

118
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,970
Oh, God.

119
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,560
Oh, yeah.

120
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,470
Our years of training have really paid off.

121
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,180
LIZZIE: So, there's, like,

122
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,810
no one else you'd rather be training with?

123
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,270
Well, who else would there be?

124
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,270
Now go get dressed. You're giving a tour in ten minutes,

125
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,740
and I really need you to sell the new recruit on our place.

126
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,900
He's not sure he wants to go here.

127
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,450
Who wouldn't want to go here?

128
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,830
Exactly.

129
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,240
We'll reel him in, Dad. Don't worry.

130
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,790
What would I do without you guys?

131
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,170
LIZZIE:  Welcome to  the Salvatore School.

132
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,330
We're your tour guides.

133
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,290
I'm Josie. I'm Lizzie.

134
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,130
Sisters. Twins.

135
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,500
Fraternal, obvs.

136
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,380
Come on. We'll show you around.

137
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,020
Everybody gets along with everybody here.

138
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,470
For the most part.

139
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,190
The wolves are pretty cliquey.

140
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,070
They mostly like to hang with their... Oh.

141
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,190
This place is a turd stain.

142
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,650
The maintenance staff must be on holiday or something.

143
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,580
Why don't we introduce you to your pack?

144
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,750
Okay.

145
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,330
Where's the pack?

146
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,330
LUIS: Hey, Jed.

147
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,720
I'm Luis.

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,010
Your alpha.

149
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,900
Do you think he'll stay?

150
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,730
It's so hard to get anyone to stay.

151
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,430
Well, if these are the breakfast offerings,

152
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,520
it's no wonder.

153
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,070
Where are the pastries?

154
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,320
The Belgian waffles?

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,310
The smoothie station?

156
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,230
: Right.

157
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,150
I'll tell Dad to add that to the budget

158
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,360
after he pays the gas bill.

159
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,410
Wait.

160
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,240
Are we... poor?

161
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,370
Lizzie, you know how expensive it is to run this place,

162
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,080
how hard it is to get benefactors.

163
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, Damon Salvatore has been

164
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,710
as generous as he can be, but he and Elena

165
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,090
have kids of their own that they need to take care of.

166
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,430
I'm gonna make sure that Dad eats.

167
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,680
He works so hard.

168
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,180
Oh, crap.

169
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,440
Genie?

170
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,860
Genie.

171
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:54,120
Is she, like, uh, talking to herself?

172
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,290
Genie.

173
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,900
The Saltzman twins are blazing hot.

174
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,950
But the blonde one es muy loco.

175
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,410
Genie.

176
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,630
Yeah?

177
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,380
This place sucks.

178
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,420
Hope's dad wrote my mom a big check

179
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,970
to fund the school when it opened,

180
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,310
so no Hope, no funding, no fun.

181
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,550
Fix it.

182
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,480
Oh, is that to be your next wish?

183
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,100
Yes, that will be my-- Wait.

184
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,430
I know how this goes.

185
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,860
I waste my first wish

186
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,440
by not being specific enough.

187
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,320
I waste my second one trying to clean up my first,

188
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,730
only to make things worse,

189
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,900
and then my third gets wasted

190
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,910
by wishing that I had never had any wishes in the first place.

191
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,120
I won't fall for it, Genie.

192
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,030
It's Jinni. That's what I said.

193
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,330
I'll beat you at your own game.

194
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,340
Make the best of this rat trap.

195
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,340
Send me back in.

196
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,850
ALARIC : I know, Caroline.

197
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,300
I am sorry I sent you on a fool's errand to Idaho,

198
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,590
but this is an inexact science

199
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,730
and we only have so much to go on.

200
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,520
We'll find new recruits, I promise.

201
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,850
LIZZIE: This is how we find new recruits?

202
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,360
Why are you acting so weird today?

203
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,910
Well, no wonder our school is lame.

204
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,870
But fear not, family.

205
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,170
I know how to help.

206
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,490
Where did you get that?

207
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,040
In the archive room.

208
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,540
We don't have an archive room.

209
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,040
Well, now it's more of just like a storage closet,

210
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,580
but no matter.

211
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,630
This is the solution

212
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,460
to all of our recruiting problems.

213
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,560
It's like a locator spell, only it's interactive.

214
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,510
The instant a new, young,

215
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,970
supernatural being is awakened to their powers,

216
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,400
this bad boy lights up.

217
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,900
That's incredible.

218
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,320
H-How do you know how to do this?

219
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,240
An annoying, know-it-all witch I knew

220
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,270
in another life created it, so I just copied her spell.

221
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,360
Go ahead.

222
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,530
Give it a spin.

223
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,870
There's so many of them.

224
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,000
All waiting for us to come to their rescue, Daddy.

225
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,420
Oh, well, there...

226
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,670
The bigger the glow, the more powerful the being.

227
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,180
Well, then we need to bring this one in immediately.

228
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,350
Yeah, it's huge. Where is that?

229
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,680
New Orleans.

230
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,880
Gross.

231
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,600
You have got to be kidding me.

232
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,650
Who the hell are you?

233
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,990
Uh-uh. Time out, Genie.

234
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,060
My name is Hope.

235
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,900
And you need to leave unless you want to be dessert.

236
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,160
Wait.

237
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,400
Hope Mikaelson?

238
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,610
I knew your parents.

239
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,420
I know where all this darkness you're feeling comes from.

240
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,670
If you just talk to me, I...

241
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,300
really think I could help.

242
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,180
You really saved the day.

243
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,220
Look at him.

244
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,010
He just looks so happy.

245
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,360
Yay, me.

246
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:57,640
And we have a couple of tours later today.

247
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,450
Now that we have a tribrid, we're in the game for real.

248
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,110
You belong here, Hope.

249
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,530
This could be your home.

250
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,950
The family you lost.

251
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,370
I can't stay.

252
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,670
I've done so many awful things.

253
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,500
That's because no one was there to guide you.

254
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,340
I don't blame you, Hope.

255
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,600
I should have found you sooner.

256
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,900
Oh...

257
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,520
screw this.

258
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,860
Genie?

259
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,360
Genie?

260
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,240
Jinni. J-I-

261
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,360
N-N, adding "I" at the end...

262
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,320
To sound exactly like "Genie."

263
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,530
Now, tell me something. Are all J-I-N-N-Is

264
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,750
this terrible at their jobs,

265
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,700
or did you completely miss the part

266
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,920
where I wished for Hope not to go here?

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,420
"I wish Hope had never come to this school,"

268
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,930
and she hadn't-- until today.

269
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,760
Fascinating that your father's dream couldn't be realized

270
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,270
without her presence, isn't it?

271
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,440
Go back inside your lamp.

272
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,390
You must choose your words carefully.

273
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,890
Precision is key.

274
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,690
I can only grant what it is you wish for, so...

275
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,610
you should figure out exactly what your heart desires,

276
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,570
or, in your case, what it does not.

277
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,950
Well...

278
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,790
what my heart does not desire is Hope

279
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,240
always showing up here to be my dad's pet.

280
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,950
So...

281
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,580
I wish...

282
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,540
that there was never a Salvatore School to begin with.

283
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,840
Your wish is my command.

284
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,420
Now, remember, if anybody starts messing with you,

285
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,810
just play it cool.

286
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,550
Don't worry, Dad. We know.

287
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,640
No magic allowed. Blah, blah, blah.

288
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,760
Public school. Makes sense.

289
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,140
All right, well, I hate to sound like a broken record,

290
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,140
but if you expose your powers...

291
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
You risk becoming a target.

292
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,560
All right, girls,

293
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,150
we'll see you in class.

294
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,490
Wait.

295
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,080
Why am I in the back seat?

296
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,510
Defense! Defense!

297
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,750
- So, do we like it here? - Where?

298
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,850
This school.

299
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,260
Lizzie, do me a favor

300
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,090
and try to keep it together today, okay?

301
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,640
- It's important. - Okay.

302
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,010
Homecoming queen!

303
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,810
Big night.

304
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,280
- Thanks. - Thanks.

305
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,450
That wasn't an invitation, Connor.

306
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,820
And that is inappropriate.

307
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,490
- Your sister's being weird again. - Cut her some slack.

308
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,490
It's hard being the only one on Homecoming without a date.

309
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,780
Wait. I don't have a date?

310
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,160
I can't wait

311
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,210
to see what you have planned for tonight.

312
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,050
I'm pretty sure you're gonna like it.

313
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,630
I am so confused.

314
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,390
- You're into Connor? - Lizzie,

315
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,970
we talked about this.

316
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,180
He's QB1. I'm head cheer.

317
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,570
It just makes sense.

318
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,480
Here's your skinny vanilla latte.

319
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,520
Not now, Dana.

320
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,070
My sister is obviously on drugs, and I despise vanilla latte.

321
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,320
Thanks, D. Mm.

322
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,820
Somebody's clearly having one of her off days.

323
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,240
Lizzie-Bear, relax.

324
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,070
There's only

325
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,950
so much a doctor can raise your dosage

326
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,010
before my mom's pharmacy will plumb run out of pills.

327
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,670
Come on.

328
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,760
Those who don't learn from history

329
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,550
are doomed to repeat it.

330
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,090
And the truth is, those 27 civilians,

331
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,390
they weren't...

332
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,260
casualties of, uh...

333
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,930
uh...

334
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,680
Does anyone remember the name

335
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,530
of the battle? Anyone?

336
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,060
- Anyone?- Lizzie£¬ Is it just me,

337
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,360
or is Dad a little day-drunk?

338
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,740
When isn't he?

339
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,620
Josie?

340
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,630
The Battle of Willow Creek.

341
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,620
Exactly.

342
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,620
All those 27 civilians, they were just rounded up

343
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,300
by their friends and neighbors,

344
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,850
hmm, all because they were different.

345
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,600
Why is he still wearing his watch?

346
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,940
Why wouldn't he be?

347
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,430
How could you forget?

348
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,310
I'm sure I didn't forget.

349
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,940
Just remind me?

350
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,320
- Homecoming Dance is tonight. - I know.

351
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
How do I not have a date?

352
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,780
This isn't about you, Lizzie.

353
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,400
Yeah, I'm totally getting that.

354
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,070
What I need you to do is

355
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:06,160
just get Dad's watch, like you promised.

356
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,620
Stefanie Salvatore's dad gave him the watch.

357
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,160
It's a magical object that I can siphon

358
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,870
so I can take things to the next level with Connor.

359
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,630
And by, um, "take things to the next level,"

360
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,300
- you mean... - I'm gonna show him I'm a witch.

361
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,340
Oh, thank God. I mean, don't get me wrong,

362
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,190
- that is a terrible idea, but for a second, I thought... - Then I'm

363
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,430
gonna have sex with him.

364
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,180
Yeah. That was it.

365
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,190
You promised you wouldn't let me down.

366
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,730
Actually do it for a change.

367
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,880
This is so lame.

368
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,260
Yeah.  Tell me about it.

369
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,880
You suck at granting wishes.

370
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,050
No. You suck at making them.

371
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,060
You are totally manipulating things

372
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,730
to make me miserable.

373
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,140
There is no world in which this would happen.

374
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,510
Shh!

375
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,020
You're gonna wake up your father.

376
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,980
Oh, well, maybe not.

377
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,570
But, for the record,

378
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,870
I can't lie.

379
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,690
Everything you are experiencing

380
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,150
is, in fact,

381
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,740
a potential reality

382
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,250
that has occurred

383
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,080
as a direct result of your wish.

384
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,040
- Whatever. - This world

385
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,500
does make sense, when you think about it.

386
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,750
Your father built the Salvatore School

387
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,040
so you could thrive.

388
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,880
You and your sister were born of a dangerous coven

389
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,420
known for breeding...  ...psychotics,

390
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,100
and so he built a safe place to shield you

391
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,760
from your darkest impulses.

392
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,390
And then you went and wished his dream away

393
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,610
because it wasn't perfect.

394
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,020
Well, now the students here don't care about protecting

395
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,060
your fragile ego.

396
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,230
So you are the school freak,

397
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,950
and your sister gets to shine.

398
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,070
Just tell me how to get out of here.

399
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,570
Well...

400
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,580
you could use another wish.

401
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,580
But, like I said,

402
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,540
language is important.

403
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,080
Besides, you think I want to be here?

404
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,970
I've spent nearly 500 years

405
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,050
granting awful wishes to self-involved humans

406
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,970
- before we even met... - This isn't

407
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,880
about you.

408
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,980
I rest my case.

409
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,990
I can't let you  go through with this.

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,990
You need to stop. Dana and Connor denied it,

411
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,740
- and I believe them. - Why would you believe them over me?

412
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,490
'Cause you always do this.

413
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,840
Any time things are going well for me, you have an episode,

414
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,340
and you ruin everything just to steal the spotlight.

415
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,840
I mean, honestly, Lizzie, if I believed

416
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,340
every paranoid delusion that came out of your mouth,

417
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,090
I'd be just as crazy as you.

418
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,680
- Jo... - Look, I'm sorry.

419
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,850
I don't want to hurt your feelings,

420
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,350
but I have spent my entire life

421
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,010
trying to make you feel okay about yourself.

422
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,100
Watched Dad kill himself trying to do it, too.

423
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,430
And why do you think

424
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,430
that he drinks all the time?

425
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,430
He hates his job. The only reason

426
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,480
why he works here is to keep an eye on you.

427
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,190
Mom makes any excuse that she can to be out of town,

428
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,860
because seeing him like this

429
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,530
makes her sad, 'cause he's completely given up.

430
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,320
So I am done

431
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,160
making excuses for you.

432
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,700
I am done worrying about when you are going to snap.

433
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,540
And I am done letting you control my happiness.

434
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,040
I love Connor, and tonight I'm going

435
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,870
to show him just how much.

436
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,550
Now, give me the watch.

437
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,310
I'm sorry.

438
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,480
It's for your own good.

439
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,570
I hate you.

440
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,360
Josie...

441
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,820
No.

442
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,820
Wait.

443
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,410
Please just...

444
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,990
wait.

445
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,710
: Stop...!

446
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,230
BOY: This could go viral.

447
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,530
What the hell?!

448
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,110
We got to go. We got to go now.

449
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,610
Now. Come on.

450
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,120
Nothing to see.

451
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,630
Looks like you guys could use some help.

452
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,040
Uh-uh. No, we are all good.

453
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,420
That "M."

454
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,550
Mikaelson. Like the boarding school?

455
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,590
Kaleb, compel the students to forget what they've seen.

456
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,720
On it. Jed,

457
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,260
establish a perimeter.

458
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,310
Lock the place down.

459
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,610
Copy. Pedro.

460
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,600
Call in the chopper.

461
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,490
Green light, Maverick.

462
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,770
Uh, I-I said that we're good.

463
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,480
Okay? Josie and I do not want to be superheroes.

464
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,660
Yeah. Speak for yourself.

465
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,660
We're not here for you.

466
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,000
We're here for him.

467
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,340
Son of a bitch.

468
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,520
HOPE:  Make yourselves at home.

469
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,350
This place, it's like a...

470
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,270
dream come true.

471
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,140
HOPE: Perhaps you've heard

472
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,600
my father has had a checkered past.

473
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,640
But when he had me, things changed.

474
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,070
There wasn't a school he could send someone like me to,

475
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,610
so he built this one.

476
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,940
And as you can see, it's been quite the success.

477
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,980
So much so that he's currently overseas

478
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,110
establishing our European branch,

479
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,460
which is why we're in need of a new headmaster.

480
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,530
I think I'm gonna be sick.

481
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,450
Sorry if the chopper ride was too bumpy.

482
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,880
Bathroom's down the hall. I know where it is.

483
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,130
Screw this world.

484
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,130
I want my final wish.

485
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,400
Have you even noticed how pleased the rest

486
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,350
of your family seems

487
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,070
with this reality?

488
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,810
They're my freaking wishes,

489
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,400
right? Indeed.

490
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,410
But if this is to be your third wish,

491
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,740
might I suggest you wish for what you truly want.

492
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,120
Isolate your biggest problem.

493
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,790
Show it no mercy.

494
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,760
I wish

495
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,600
Hope Mikaelson was never born.

496
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,230
Your wish is my command.

497
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,180
KALEB: Hey.

498
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,930
Hey.

499
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,060
Hey. What's-your-name.

500
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,900
Sun's almost down. We can't stay here.

501
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,110
JED: Patrols will be out soon.

502
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,230
We got to move.

503
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,320
Where the hell are we?

504
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,700
Damn, white girl.

505
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,240
Mystic Falls.

506
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,910
You said your father could help us get out of here.

507
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,040
Maybe down to Mexico. Dr. Saltzman is

508
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,670
your father, right? And you know where to find him?

509
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,300
Why are their eyes all scratched out?

510
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,920
'Cause they're finally free.

511
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,930
Hey. Come on. Death is better

512
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,720
than being hunted by Triad until you starve, bruh.

513
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,930
Speaking of.

514
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,900
It's time to bounce.

515
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,360
Okay, lead the way, blondie.

516
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,870
I hope the Supernatural Railroad isn't just a fairy tale.

517
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,520
Welcome to the Resistance.

518
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,700
I wish I could say it was under better circumstances.

519
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,030
You've got a lot of nerve, showing up here.

520
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,490
Penelope,

521
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,660
what's going on? At least you earned

522
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,370
this mental breakdown.

523
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,660
Leave,

524
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,990
before I feed you to the vamps.

525
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,790
Please, just tell me what's happening.

526
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,550
Out!

527
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,840
Who died?

528
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,050
Dad.

529
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,890
What's going on? Why is this world

530
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,890
like this?

531
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,150
Sweetie...

532
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,980
...you can't be here.

533
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,690
You ran away.

534
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,620
I've been worried sick, looking for you.

535
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,620
Why would I run?

536
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,830
You don't remember what happened?

537
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,750
Must be some sort of

538
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,090
What trauma? It doesn't matter now.

539
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,550
All that matters is that you're home.

540
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,460
Not that we can stay much longer.

541
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,470
Triad's closing in every day.

542
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,430
The world knows about vampires?

543
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,340
You've forgotten more than I thought.

544
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,350
Klaus Mikaelson lost everything

545
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,180
that anchored him to his humanity,

546
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,940
and so he shut it off two years ago

547
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,280
and started a war.

548
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,940
Outed supernaturals in the process.

549
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,020
And just like that, Triad had an ugly,

550
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,110
racist platform to stand on,

551
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,030
and nothing's been safe ever since.

552
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,910
Where's Josie?

553
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,000
Dad.

554
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,910
Where is she?

555
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,340
She's dead, Elizabeth.

556
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,180
The vigil's for her.

557
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,090
No.  No, no.

558
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,090
She-she can't...

559
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,760
she can't be.

560
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,310
That's not what I wanted.

561
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,890
I know. But, right now, you just...

562
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,390
need to get some sleep. No.

563
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,990
No, no.

564
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,150
I-I can-- I can fix this.

565
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,980
I-I can make this whole

566
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,480
miserable world go away.

567
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,900
Josie's not really gone.

568
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,440
I promise, okay?

569
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,440
I'll fix it.

570
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,830
Genie?!

571
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,070
Genie?!

572
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,990
Genie! Elizabeth, please, please...

573
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,170
This was my last wish.

574
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
I can't take it back.

575
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,340
: Oh. I've ruined everything.

576
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,790
Oh, no. It's my fault. Penelope.

577
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,460
It's all my fault!

578
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,500
Penelope!

579
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,030
Damn you, Genie.

580
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,040
It's Jin--

581
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,700
Never mind.

582
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,240
Don't be so hard on yourself,

583
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,160
even if your father did just lock you up in a cellar

584
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,700
for your own safety.

585
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,030
Third wish is always tricky.

586
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,590
Better luck on your next one.

587
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,330
My next one?

588
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,880
I-I get another wish?

589
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,040
Whoever told you a jinni only grants three?

590
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,050
Aladdin.

591
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,510
Every genie story ever.

592
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,230
A jinni can grant or ignore any wish they choose.

593
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,180
We won't work against our own self-interest,

594
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,510
so you can forget about wishing me dead.

595
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,230
But if you'd like another wish to reset your life

596
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,240
right back to where we began,

597
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,740
I can do that.

598
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,190
On one condition.

599
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,190
Anything.

600
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,520
What?

601
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,790
You give me the urn.

602
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,080
LIZZIE:  Oh, I knew you were

603
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,080
gonna screw me. You used my words against me,

604
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,700
right from the start.

605
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,540
Like you said, I'm a monster.

606
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,160
Should've trusted your gut.

607
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,080
You trapped me in the worst situation imaginable,

608
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,500
just so you could get what you want!

609
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,250
The urn is a small price to pay

610
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,670
to cease suffering like this.

611
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,920
You don't know anything about suffering.

612
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,880
Don't I?

613
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,720
As all jinn are, I was born into five centuries of suffering.

614
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,310
500 years of realizing

615
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,930
other people's dreams before I'd ever have

616
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,110
the chance to pursue one

617
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,530
of my own.

618
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,560
And in the 499th year of my term,

619
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,360
I crossed paths with a true monster.

620
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,030
And it consumed me,

621
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,860
sent me to a place of total isolation,

622
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,400
utter damnation.

623
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,400
Malivore.

624
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,790
I know.

625
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,460
So what?

626
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,740
I wandered there,

627
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,740
lost and alone,

628
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,750
until I was given one final chance to win my freedom.

629
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,920
So accept my offer and wish me the urn.

630
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,800
If I wish you the urn,

631
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,800
I'm giving you the key to a supernatural apocalypse.

632
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,220
Isn't that technically against your self-interest?

633
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,590
Quite the opposite.

634
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,840
It's my only hope.

635
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,810
Because if I return the urn to Malivore,

636
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,100
then I am free

637
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,930
and at peace. Whatever happens

638
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,890
after that is not my problem.

639
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,400
Selfish.

640
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,150
Said the pot to the kettle.

641
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,400
I don't know why we're debating.

642
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,070
This life is dreadful.

643
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,240
So wish it away!

644
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,900
Shut up, okay?! I just--

645
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,910
I need to think. I need to find a loophole.

646
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,500
There is no loophole.

647
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,340
Magic always has a loophole.

648
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,670
Yeah? Well, you better find it quickly.

649
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,250
Things are taking a hell of a turn up there.

650
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,640
What do you mean?

651
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,440
Dad?

652
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,760
Lizzie.

653
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,430
Did Penelope let you out?

654
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,520
We've been working on getting the right dosages for you.

655
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,690
What are we doing? Are we hiding?

656
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,440
No, we're fighting.

657
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,780
Triad got wind of our location.

658
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,530
With Josie gone, we decided to take a stand

659
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,160
and put an end to this once and for all.

660
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,160
Oh, God.

661
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,830
You're gonna get slaughtered.

662
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,540
And it's all my fault.

663
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,200
No, it's my fault.

664
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,050
I should've never kept that secret from you.

665
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,550
What secret?

666
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,540
Your mom and I had been waiting for the right time

667
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:53,170
to tell you a piece of your family history, but...

668
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,170
we waited too long.

669
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,220
What family history?

670
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,510
There's something that happens to twins born into your coven,

671
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,350
like you and Josie.

672
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,730
When you turn 22,

673
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,070
the Gemini must merge.

674
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,070
Merge?

675
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,980
It's a battle of will.

676
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,860
Only the strongest of the two twins will survive it.

677
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,740
So one of us would have to kill the other one?

678
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,910
We've been trying to find a way to prevent it

679
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,080
ever since you were little kids.

680
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,990
That's why your mom's always off traveling.

681
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,660
We tried to keep it from you as long as we could.

682
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,210
But when we turned the house into a rescue operation,

683
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,170
one of the witches who was passing through

684
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,380
told you the story of the Gemini, and you...

685
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,710
Dad,

686
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,420
what did I do?

687
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,770
You got scared.

688
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,930
You had one of your episodes, and you went dark.

689
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,770
Paranoid.

690
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,270
To you, Josie became your biggest threat.

691
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:54,270
You became obsessed with winning,

692
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,370
and then you lost control.

693
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,280
I killed her.

694
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,790
It was an accident.

695
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,790
No matter how you say it...

696
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,340
...I killed her.

697
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,960
You must hate me so much.

698
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,460
No.

699
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,920
The only person I hate is myself for failing you both.

700
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,640
No. Dad, I've been to other places,

701
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,970
other realities,

702
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,970
and I know that that sounds crazy,

703
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,890
but you need to believe me.

704
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,150
You always do everything that you can to protect me and Josie.

705
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,150
Time after time.

706
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,480
World after world.

707
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,660
Then I wish we could be in one of your other worlds right now.

708
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,820
No matter what happens, I need you to hear this.

709
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,710
To believe me.

710
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,670
There's a world where your dream came true.

711
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,330
You built a school for me and Josie,

712
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,680
and it was so beautiful.

713
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,420
And we were safe

714
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,840
and loved.

715
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,720
And you helped so many people.

716
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:06,140
And I was just too stupid

717
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,180
and jealous to see it.

718
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,190
In this other world,

719
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:14,150
did I tell you about the Merge?

720
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,030
Then I guess we were both pretty stupid, huh?

721
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,460
It's time.

722
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,870
No. Dad, wait.

723
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,500
I can get us out of this.

724
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,830
I just need to think.

725
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,290
That's a good idea.

726
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,680
You think, baby.

727
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,810
I love you.

728
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,020
I love you so much.

729
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,580
Let's go give them their war.

730
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,500
Think. Think.

731
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,260
Not exactly your strong suit.

732
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,170
This would all go so much easier

733
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,420
if you'd just accept my offer.

734
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,050
Zip it, Smurfette.

735
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,050
I know there's a way we can both get what we want.

736
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,600
I just have to think of the perfect wish.

737
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,390
As I've told you, I will not grant you anything

738
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,180
unless it involves me finding peace.

739
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,440
And I said quiet!

740
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,400
Maybe you need a little incentive.

741
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,070
Incoming!

742
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,420
Icaeus.

743
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,320
Incentivized?

744
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,490
Okay, fine.

745
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:28,490
Bouncing through your wonky worlds taught me something.

746
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,160
I am selfish.

747
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,660
I've made mistakes.

748
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,120
But giving you the urn

749
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,950
would be the biggest mistake of all.

750
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,950
It could ruin everyone's life,

751
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,330
destroy my father's dream

752
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,420
of making any reality a better place.

753
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,130
It's bad enough that I did that to him

754
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,340
time after time. I can't do it again.

755
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,850
You sure about that?

756
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,270
When I fix this, he'll be fine.

757
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,030
And I won't give you the satisfaction of breaking me.

758
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,200
You were already broken. That's why I chose you

759
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,160
- in the first place.  - That just means

760
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:15,200
that you can't break me any more.

761
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,710
So read my lips.

762
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:21,330
I am never wishing you that urn.

763
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,040
You want it so bad?

764
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,340
Why didn't you just take it when it was right in front of you?

765
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,560
Because you can't.

766
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,180
That's it, isn't it?

767
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,180
You said it yourself.

768
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:41,570
You can only do what someone wishes you to do.

769
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,060
That's your curse.

770
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,120
And you are just as broken as I am.

771
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,860
But I know how to fix you.

772
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,080
How?

773
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,000
By winning your dumbass game.

774
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,760
I wish that you had never met

775
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,800
the monster that sent you to Malivore.

776
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,010
If I never went to Malivore...

777
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,880
You'd have completed your 500 years of service.

778
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,890
I'd be free.

779
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,760
That's my wish.

780
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,520
Take it or leave it.

781
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,060
Your wish is my command.

782
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,690
Boom! Suck on that!

783
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,610
But there's a catch.

784
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,360
We will never have met, either, which means...

785
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,450
I won't remember the Merge.

786
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,240
Not consciously.

787
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,960
You'll be just like all those poor souls

788
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,280
I helped over the centuries who used their final wishes

789
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,120
to reset their realities.

790
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,540
What happened to them?

791
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,250
They found their worlds just as they left them.

792
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,580
Only their minds weren't.

793
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,970
Because somehow our journeys stayed with them

794
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,260
and slowly drove them insane.

795
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,380
It's like you said.

796
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,930
There's always a loophole with magic.

797
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,260
And when you find out your father's secret,

798
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,970
as you inevitably will,

799
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,480
history will likely repeat itself,

800
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,320
and you'll kill Josie all over again.

801
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,110
- I take it back. I-I wish to...  - I thank you

802
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,400
- for my freedom, Lizzie. - No!

803
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,940
I said wait!

804
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,830
Wait!

805
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,490
Lizzie?

806
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,450
Lizzie.

807
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,080
Lizzie?

808
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,840
Please don't be mad at Dad.

809
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,250
Oh. What's happening?

810
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,100
- Why are you suffocating me?  - I have no idea.

811
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,600
Look, I don't know when it started,

812
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,370
but on a fundamental level, I think I'm broken.

813
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,870
And I realize this is all very sudden,

814
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,280
but I just, for whatever reason,

815
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,450
have this feeling

816
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,280
that something terrible is gonna happen if I don't change.

817
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,200
I... I'm so sorry, Caroline.

818
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,710
I know, I should not have missed your texts about the kids.

819
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,540
It won't happen again.

820
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,830
Lizzie's been vibrating pretty high.

821
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,970
You think she's on the verge of an episode?

822
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,220
Yeah. All right.

823
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,140
I'll keep an eye on her.

824
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,720
Any other leads?

825
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:25,470
All right.

826
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,810
Well, keep at it.

827
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,690
We'll find a solution.

828
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,150
Yeah.

829
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,160
You got a sec?

830
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,920
Well, this morning's evidence to the contrary,

831
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,340
I always have time for you.

832
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,340
What's on your mind?

833
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,090
I'm sorry about earlier.

834
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,840
Mom gave me all of these tools

835
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,940
to manage my ups and downs, but...

836
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,060
they all go out the window when it comes to Hope.

837
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,690
That seems pretty self-aware.

838
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,610
What brought this on?

839
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,900
I don't know.

840
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,610
Well...

841
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,120
maybe it'll come to you.

842
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,250
In the meantime, I appreciate you trying.

843
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,620
I love you, Dad.

844
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,840
Aw. I love you, too, sweetheart.

845
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,080
What's that?

846
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,090
Oh! This is...

847
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,970
nothing you need to worry about.

848
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,350
The thoughts in my head,

849
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,640
I think that they have something to do with Hope.

850
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,270
- What's all that?  - Oh, I was thinking

851
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,320
we could spell a barrier around the urn

852
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,910
so when the next monster shows up, we can trap it.

853
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,200
Want to help?

854
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,000
Pass.

855
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,950
But I can't put my finger on it.

856
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,880
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

857
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,250
Any thoughts?

858
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,250
I don't know, Lizzie.

859
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,470
Sounds like you got a lot going on.

860
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,010
Isn't it past your curfew, Pedro?

861
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,310
Go to bed.

862
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,970
And leave the sandwich.

863
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:32,480
But you said you wanted to talk.

864
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,480
Did I?

865
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,420
Can't imagine why.
