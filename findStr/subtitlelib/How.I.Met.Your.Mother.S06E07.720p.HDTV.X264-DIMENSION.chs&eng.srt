00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,410
我只吐了三回
I only threw up thrice.

150
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,880
等等  兰迪  你把赫曼森公司的合同
Wait. Randy, did you send the Hermanson

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
送到市中心去了吗
contracts downtown?

152
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,980
送去了
I did.

153
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,550
我送去市中心了
I sent them downtown.

154
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,950
你干嘛要说谎
Why are you saying it like that?

155
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,560
市中心的办公室从没收到过
They never arrived at the downtown office.

156
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,760
这个
They...

157
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,060
咱们说的是同一件事吧
Well, just to make sure we're on the same page,

158
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,330
"送到市中心"的意思
is "send them downtown"

159
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,700
不是销毁文件的委婉说法吗
not an expression for shredding a document?

160
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,630
你把文件销毁了
You shredded them?!

161
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,370
是啊  我把它们送去市中心了
Yeah. I sent them downtown.

162
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,070
往下塞进碎纸机
You know, down into the shredder.

163
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,070
市中心一词的字面意思是  下城

164
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,370
把纸张倒过来
You-you feed the paper

165
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,470
喂进机器里
in a downwards fashion,

166
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,140
这个暗语就是这么来的
so that's where the expression comes from.

167
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,240
这不是什么暗语
That's not an expression!

168
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,680
从来就没有过暗语
That has never been an expression!

169
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,840
这事交给我吧
Okay, I can fix this.

170
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,480
这个项目我很熟
I am all over this project.

171
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,820
我要说
I'll say this:

172
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,780
那家伙是个祸害
There is no quit in that guy.

173
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:06,990
你该解雇他
You should fire him.

174
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,850
行了  就这句话
Okay, that, that right there.

175
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,160
你这态度  正是我不愿上镜头的原因
That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video.

176
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,920
因为巨人银行毫无关怀可言
Because GNB doesn't care.

177
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,960
他们解雇人  已经是家常便饭了
They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres.

178
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,230
就在上周  我正跟亚瑟说话
Just last week, I was talking to Arthur...

179
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,370
你系着条绿领带
Oh, whoa, you're wearing a green tie now.

180
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,330
绿领带是我系的
I'm wearing a green tie.

181
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,970
巨人银行不把人当人看
GNB treats people like they're disposable,

182
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,010
我可不会与他们为伍
and I will not be a part of that.

183
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,160
马修・埃里克森是不会解雇职员
Marshall Eriksen does not fire people,

184
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,210
现阶段不会
period.

185
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,110
通知你们一下
Uh, just want you to know,

186
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,850
这个新项目  进展顺利
we are making good progress on this new project.

187
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,220
你们接着聊
Oh, you gentlemen keep talking,

188
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,950
我来接电话
I will answer that.

189
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,550
马修・埃里克森办公室
Marshall Eriksen's office.

190
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,060
好的  我可以帮你查
Yeah, I can get that for you.

191
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,560
稍等
Just a second.

192
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,800
银行  GNB中的"B"指的是银行
Uh... bank. The "B" stands for bank.

193
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,900
好了  妈妈  晚上见
Okay, Mother, I'll see you tonight.

194
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,800
糟了  我去给一团糟先生拿张纸巾
Oh, yikes. I'd better get Mr. Messy a napkin.

195
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,740
我说现阶段
Period.

196
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,650
跟我说  你到底跟谁上床了
Just tell me who you slept with!

197
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,550
莉莉  我不想聊这个  好吗
Lily, I don't want to get into it, okay?

198
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,950
我知道了  是我们认识的人
Aha, it's someone we know.

199
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,950
如果是我们都不认识的陌生人
If it was some ding dong we didn't know,

200
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,150
你只要说出他的名字就行了
you'd just give me his name.

201
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,620
好吧  他叫比尔・佩伯
Fine. It's Bill Pepper.

202
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,890
比尔・佩伯
Bill Pepper?

203
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,160
对啊
Mm-hmm.

204
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,330
这真巧了  桌上正好有
Kind of a coincidence there happens

205
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,630
一份账单和一罐辣椒粉
to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table.

206
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,630
Bill有账单的意思  Pepper有辣椒的意思

207
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,070
你和比尔是不是还和一个叫福柯纸巾的人玩3P了
Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin?

208
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,040
被识破了
Oh...

209
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,310
果然是我们认识的人
It's someone we know!

210
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,610
我想你们都读过了
So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters

211
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,140
希腊复兴时期建筑的相关章节了
on the Greek Revival architecture.

212
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,080
有什么问题吗
Any questions?

213
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,250
我有  你晚上能安心睡觉吗
Yes. How do you sleep at night?

214
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,330
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

215
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,930
我最近突然觉得
It was recently made clear to me

216
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,830
我对建筑一无所知
that I don't know the first thing about architecture,

217
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,600
所以我就来了
so here I am.

218
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,770
很好  那开始上课吧
Very well, then, let's get started.

219
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,500
有哪些属于希腊复兴时期的建筑呢
Some examples of Greek Revival architecture...

220
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,470
我知道  我知道
Ooh! Ooh!

221
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,210
阿卡迪亚大楼  是希腊复兴建筑吗
Is The Arcadian Greek Revival?

222
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,310
不是
No.

223
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,780
阿卡迪亚大楼是什么
What's The Arcadian?

224
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,050
是莫斯比教授打算拆毁的
Oh, it's just this beautiful, old building

225
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,320
一座非常古老而美丽的建筑
that Professor Mosby wants to tear down.

226
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,450
什么  不会的
What?! No,

227
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,420
莫斯比教授对古建筑充满热爱
Professor Mosby loves old buildings.

228
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,350
他不会这么做的  对吧  泰德
He wouldn't do that. Right, Ted?

229
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,490
回到希腊复兴时期...
Getting back to Greek Revival...

230
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,830
我被他们鄙视了
I lost them.

231
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,600
你太没任教的经验了
Look, you're new at teaching.

232
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
在我幼儿园班里
In my kindergarten class,

233
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,470
有一大堆不听话的学生
I have had plenty of troublesome students.

234
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,800
比如强尼・马列
Like Johnny Marley...

235
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,670
强尼
Johnny?

236
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,910
强尼
Johnny!

237
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:42,110
他和他的毛绒小马  成天不得消停
He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell.

238
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,480
但我有个简单的法子制服他们
But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers.

239
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,190
你们还记得  总停在外面的
You know that '98 Taurus that's

240
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,650
那辆98款福特金牛车吧
always parked outside?

241
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,790
警报器异常恼人的那辆
The one with the really annoying alarm?

242
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,230
那声音我们太熟悉了
We're familiar with it.

243
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,200
每当班里有像强尼那样的孩子捣乱时
Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...

244
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,620
立刻就能让他们闭嘴
Shuts them right up.

245
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,060
莉莉  我的学生是成年人
Lily, my students are adults,

246
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,390
我要以成年人的方式对待他们
and I treat them that way.

247
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,930
我只要给他们带些糖果
I'll just give them more candy

248
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,090
再放上一张混音唱片
and make them a mix CD.

249
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,660
问题就解决了
Problem solved.

250
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,660
宝贝  怎么了
Oh, baby, what's wrong?

251
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,230
我干了件坏事
Something bad happened.

252
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,530
兰迪  你有没有看见...
Randy, hey, have you seen the...

253
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,530
你问之前让我先说
Before you get to that,

254
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,800
之前我在做的那个项目
regarding the earlier project I was working on...

255
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,240
大功告成
Voil?

256
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,670
那是赫曼森公司的合同吗
That's the Hermanson contract?

257
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,240
是要赫曼森公司的
The Hermanson contract?

258
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,080
倒霉  这是费尔伯特公司的
Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract.

259
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,280
-该死  -不要
- Damn it! - No...

260
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,580
你刚才要问什么
Anyway, what's your thing?

261
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,320
我需要费尔伯特公司的合同
I need the Filbert contract!

262
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,480
不是吧
No!!

263
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,720
这样  我会尽我所能
Well, I'll do what I can.

264
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,670
但凭我的经验而言
But in my experience,

265
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,030
粉碎两次  就无可还原了
twice shredded is fairly permanent.

266
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,460
抱歉  兰迪  但是
Sorry, Randy, but...

267
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,530
这样下去不是办法
this just isn't working out.

268
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,170
马修终于开苞了
Marshall popped his cherry!

269
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,640
好了  马修  你得承认那个人确实是个灾难
Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster.

270
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,040
他给公司蒙羞
I mean, it reflected badly on the company.

271
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,410
他是个耻辱
He was an embarrassment.

272
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,780
一个巨大的耻辱
A huge embarrassment.

273
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,280
你和兰迪上床了
You slept with Randy!

274
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,450
什么
What?!

275
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,320
太简单了 我亲爱的特布罗特生 [模仿福尔摩斯对华生说话]
Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson.

276
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,020
你的同事因为一条白痴的广告
Your co-host is getting super-popular

277
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,890
变得超受欢迎
because of her stupid commercial,

278
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,360
大游艇  小游艇  大小游艇
"Boats! Boats! Boats!"

279
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,260
你在我们走了之后  来到GNB的办公室派对
So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left,

280
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,400
你心情低落  酩酊大醉
you were feeling vulnerable and drunk.

281
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,300
在那个人并不多的会议室里
Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room,

282
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,340
你们俩  对上眼了
your eyes met.

283
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,570
而且众所周知
And as we all remember...

284
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,340
兰迪有一个特殊的情况
<i>Randy has a unique condition.

285
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,310
你鼻血流的跟水龙头一样
Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.

286
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,020
天啊  只要我一勃起就这样
Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection.

287
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,350
真是抱歉
I am so sorry.

288
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,650
那
That's...

289
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,190
就是事实
...exactly what happened.

290
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,190
看见没  马修
See, Marshall,

291
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,160
如果说被炒鱿鱼是执行死刑
if getting fired is an execution,

292
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,130
那至少他在临死前享受了最后的晚餐
at least the guy had a last meal.

293
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,000
我向你保证
I promise you,

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,830
明天你就会好的
tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.

295
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,600
兰迪  怎么了
Randy, hey, what's going on?

296
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,070
我只是想说我并不生气
I just wanted to say no hard feelings.

297
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:24,110
谢谢
Thank you.

298
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,080
那你现在要去哪
So where you headed now?

299
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,680
下去啦
Downtown.

300
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,390
不要
No!!

301
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,290
没事的  宝贝
It's okay, baby.

302
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,720
<i>一点都不好</i>
<i>It wasn't okay.</i>

303
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,030
<i>第二天早晨</i>
<i>So the next morning... </i>

304
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,460
亚瑟  我来这是因为我犯了一个错误
Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake.

305
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,900
我昨天炒了兰迪
I fired Randy yesterday.

306
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,960
那确实是个错误
That was a mistake.

307
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,630
你一年前就该把他炒了
You should have fired him a year ago.

308
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,570
不  先生  这是这家公司的问题所在
No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company.

309
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,670
我们怎么能一边高喊"巨人银行  用心关怀"
How can we say "GNB Cares,"

310
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,310
一边转身这样对待别人呢
and then turn around and treat someone like that?

311
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,970
当然  他确实犯了一些错误
I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes,

312
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,310
但是人人都会犯错
but everybody makes mistakes.

313
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,510
就像小拖船一样
Like, like Tugboat here.

314
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,010
我打赌它肯定也犯过错
Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes.

315
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,550
但你也没有放弃小拖船  不是吗
And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?

316
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,990
没  我把它阉了之后  现在好多了
No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.

317
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,050
就是这样  其实也不尽然
Exactly, kind of.

318
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,520
兰迪需要的不是炒鱿鱼
Randy doesn't need to be fired.

319
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,120
他需要的是修整
He needs to be fixed.

320
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,430
马修  在这里我们干很多坏事  但是我
Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I...

321
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,700
不  先生  我希望当人们犯错时
No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone

322
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,900
我们应该帮助他们  而不是把他们开除
when they screw up, we should... we should help them.

323
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,770
我们应该培育他们
We should nurture them.

324
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,180
我连续三天每小时
I changed the ice pack on his crotch

325
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,940
给它换一次胯下的冰敷袋
every hour for three days.

326
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:39,180
埃里克森  如果你想返聘兰迪  我支持你
Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you,

327
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,490
因为来到这里  说出你刚刚的那番话
because to come in here and say what you just said,

328
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,920
你和小拖船确实有很大的不同
well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.

329
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,330
同学们  摇滚教授这张自制CD真的很棒
Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?

330
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,630
一段纽约历史将被摧毁
A piece of New York history is being torn down,

331
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,970
而你却说"爱咋咋地"
and all you could say was "Boo freakin' hoo"?

332
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,070
爱咋
Boo... freakin'...

333
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,940
或许是我在一次玩脚球沙包的时候
I may have mentioned our conversation

334
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,770
跟他们小提了一下我们的对话
over a session of hacky sack.

335
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,740
我没来沙包小组的那天
The one day I miss the sack circle,

336
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,640
你们让她进来了
you guys sub her in?

337
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,840
你为什么会没来
Why'd you miss?

338
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,210
忙着拆毁自由女神像吗
Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty?

339
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,320
不是  我正忙着退还你们都很喜欢的热狗服
No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.

340
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,990
他们开始攻击我
They were all turning against me,

341
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,990
所以我想  管他呢
so I figured, what the hell.

342
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,070
管用吗
And did it work?

343
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,210
超级管用
Like gangbusters.

344
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,140
我们又是好兄弟了
We're buddies again.

345
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,840
下课以后  我们又踢了一会儿沙包
After class, we hacked a little sack

346
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,980
伴随着我摇滚教授那张CD的强劲音乐
to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD.

347
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,310
是的  他们没人听过小妖精乐队的《B-side》专辑
And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side.

348
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,620
[the Pixies 1986年成立于波士顿  解散于1993年]

349
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,620
就是因为他们都不知道小妖精这个乐队
Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies.

350
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,880
我才可以光明正大把《 B-side》这张专辑偷来用
Or a B-side.

351
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,650
你们好
Hey, guys.

352
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,520
我见过那个笑容
Uh-oh. I know that smile.

353
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,360
莉莉  你要挺住
Lily, there's no easy way to say this.

354
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,590
马修死了
Marshall's dead.

355
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,160
兰迪杀了他
Randy murdered him.

356
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,960
不对  我知道兰迪为什么会笑
No. I know why Randy is smiling.

357
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,430
是因为罗宾
You're smiling because of Robin.

358
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,530
罗宾  就像我洗澡的时候幻想她那样吗
Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower?

359
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,000
我在吃饭呢  老兄
I'm trying to eat here, buddy.

360
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,270
不是  因为你万圣节那天和她上床了
No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.

361
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,170
什么  没有啊
What? No.

362
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,540
我回了家  洗完澡就睡觉了
I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed.

363
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,610
你没和她上床吗
You didn't sleep with her?

364
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,150
没有
No.

365
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,350
哪怕是在洗澡的时候
Even in the shower,

366
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,180
我们最多也就是抱抱
the farthest we ever get is hugging.

367
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,720
那你笑什么
So why are you smiling?

368
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,250
我来告诉你们
I'll tell you why.

369
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,520
不能再这样下去了
This just isn't working out.

370
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,260
<i>真好  我又要被炒鱿鱼了</i>
<i>I'm fired. Great.</i>

371
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,100
<i>就跟以前的商场蜡烛事件一样  历史重演了</i>
<i>This is the candle kiosk at the mall all over again.</i>

372
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,460
<i>等一等</i>
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

373
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,530
<i>我能拿到一笔赔偿金</i>
<i>I can get a severance check.</i>

374
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,430
<i>只要我不把它放粉碎机里撕毁了</i>
<i>If I don't shred it,</i>

375
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,500
<i>我就可以用那笔钱开一家啤酒厂</i>
<i>I can use that money to start my own brewery. </i>

376
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,110
<i>想象会有一瓶印上我名字的啤酒</i>
<i>Imagine a beer with my name on it. </i>

377
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,580
<i>兰迪・温尿  这是你人生中最美好的一天
<i>Randy Wharmpiss, this is the best day of your life.

378
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,650
多亏了那笔赔偿金
Thanks to that severance check,

379
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,820
明年的这个时候  你们将会品尝到
this time next year, you'll all be enjoying

380
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,520
一杯泡沫丰富的温尿啤酒
a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.

381
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,490
兰迪  特大喜讯
Randy, great news!

382
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,960
你没有被解雇
You're not fired!

383
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,230
搞毛啊
No...!

384
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,600
早上好  各位
Good morning, everybody...

385
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,440
我的学生呢
Where's my class?

386
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,310
你好  教授
Hello, Professor.

387
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,440
完胜
Ha-boom.

388
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,360
我把你的工作争取回来了  兰迪
I got you your job back, Randy.

389
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,800
我以为你会很高兴
I thought that you'd be happy.

390
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,300
但是我跟这里格格不入
But I don't belong here.

391
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,140
我生来就是个酿酒师  我是啤酒花大师
I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister!

392
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,240
那就辞职啊  没人阻止你
Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.

393
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,410
我不能  我需要赔偿金
I-I can't. I need my severance check.

394
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,810
真不好意思  兰迪  这是诈骗
Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.

395
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,240
这不是诈骗
It's not fraud.

396
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,980
我只是想你炒了我  然后得到大笔赔偿金
I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here

397
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,780
并且不告诉任何人
and not tell anyone about it.

398
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,880
即使我炒了你  我还是要向亚瑟汇报
Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...

399
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,390
得了吧  亚瑟不会记住这点小事的
Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that.

400
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,560
马修  昨天的谈话真是让人记忆深刻
Marshall, what a memorable talk we had yesterday.

401
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,220
兰迪  我谨代表巨人银行的每一位员工
Randy, on behalf of everyone at GNB,

402
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,590
无论是坐牢还是出狱的
both in and out of prison,

403
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,130
我们对此事深感抱歉
we're sorry.

404
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,600
而且我要向你保证
And I want to assure you

405
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,060
你再也不会被开除了
you will never be fired again.

406
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,500
你会在这一直工作直到你死为止
You're going to work here until you die, huh?

407
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,900
绿色领带
Green tie?

408
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,640
有品位
Nice choice.

409
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,340
谢谢  非常夺目
Thanks. It brings out my eyes.

410
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,840
没错  我真想夺走你的目
Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes.

411
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,410
兰迪  我很抱歉
Listen, Randy, I'm sorry,

412
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,180
但是我曾经打破了我的道德准则
but I broke my own moral code once

413
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,820
我很有负罪感
and I felt evil.

414
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,580
我不会让巨人银行改变我
I will not let GNB change me.

415
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,690
我永远也不会开除任何一个人
I will never fire anyone again ever.

416
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,520
那我们走着瞧
Oh, we'll see about that.

417
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,830
管他的  我对准了
Anyhoo, while I got you--

418
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,800
笑一个
big smile.

419
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,630
"我们关心让梦想照进现实"
"We care about making dreams come true,"

420
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,070
三  二
in three, two...

421
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,870
不
No!

422
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,940
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

423
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,440
你不爽我吗
Oh, are you unhappy with my performance?

424
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,480
我想我被解雇了
Well, I guess I'm fired, then.

425
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,240
我最好上交我的ID卡
I'd better turn in my I.D.

426
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,550
不  实际上
No, it's actually,

427
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,150
真高兴你把我桌上的杂物弄走
um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk.

428
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,320
谢谢了  兰迪
So thank you, Randy.

429
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,720
还有更精彩的
And there's more.

430
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,090
我不知道我拍这个干嘛
I don't know what I'm going to use this for,

431
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,390
但这真是好镜头
but it's great stuff.

432
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,830
现在我被解雇了吗
Now am I fired?

433
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,730
我早就想彻底打扫那些文件柜
I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.

434
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,000
当我是透明的
I'm not even here.

435
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,570
兰迪  还有咖啡
Randy, the coffee.

436
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,740
好吧
Oh! Okay.

437
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,410
好吧
Okay.

438
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,840
真是谢谢你了  兰迪
Thank you, Randy.

439
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,180
我一直想减少咖啡因的摄入量
I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.

440
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,780
拿这个试试  使劲用力泼
Here, try this, but really go for it.

441
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,750
记住  这家伙毁了你的人生
Remember, this guy ruined your life.

442
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,990
这就是我需要的提神饮料
That's just the pick-me-up I needed.

443
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,530
说到提神  第一个镜头能再来一遍吗
Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?

444
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
你好
Hello.

445
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,970
那招不管用了  他们讨厌我
It didn't work. They hate me.

446
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,940
怎么才能让他们再喜欢我
How do I get them to like me again?

447
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,570
你不需要
You don't.

448
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,100
泰德  你是他们的老师
Ted, you're their teacher.

449
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,170
唯一喜欢老师的那种人
The only people that like their teachers...

450

泰德  你只需要学习接受他们的恨意

454
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,890
因为在恨意的背后  是恐惧
Because behind that hatred lies fear.

455
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,790
你能利用恐惧
And you can use that fear,

456
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,120
就像我对约翰・尼马利一样
like I did with Johnny Marley.

457
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,590
难道那个故事不止这么简单
Was there more to that story?

458
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,690
有一点
A little bit.

459

460
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,310
是有点
A little bit.

461

哇  熊猫真好看

<i>我考虑了莉莉的建议</i>

463

明天不在教室的人  成绩是F

467

你那样说的
You said that?

468
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,810
专业上来说  是他们成绩不完整
Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete,

469
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,910
但我觉得"F"对他们来说是一个不错的警钟
but I thought "F" had a nice, scary ring to it.

470
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,780
-对吧  -没错
- Right?  - Yeah.

471
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
罗宾  你和谁睡了

474
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,720
又睁眼说瞎话呢  罗宾
Where's the poop, Robin?

475

好吧  我没和任何人睡

问题是  自从贝基做了那个广告

什么  你为什么不告诉我们

<i>膀胱有问题  是非常尴尬</i>

491
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,470
或许破坏你的办公室是错的
Maybe trashing your office was a mistake.

492
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,610
只不过  在我能记事的时候
It's just, uh, as long as I can remember,

493
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,110
酿造啤酒就是我的梦想
