1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,190
Hey, best man.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,190
Yeah, I think I might go with "Best person."

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,430
Is this about mom again? I told you, I'm fine.

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,780
I was just a little sad for you.

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,880
Mom's a no-show,

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,960
and you and dad are hardly even speaking.

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,980
I'm leaving you!

8
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,130
Not if I leave you first!

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,630
What did you do?!

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,900
Attention! Attention, please!

11
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,860
The fire has jumped the freeway.

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,550
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

13
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,790
If you're evacuating the whole area,

14
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,350
can't you just do us last?

15
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
I don't think you realize

16
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,290
how close you are to actual flames.

17
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,770
Hello. Pepper Saltzman.

18
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,820
Big supporter of yours.

19
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,100
Have all your calendars.

20
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,060
We've waited 10 years.

21
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,630
Can we please have an hour?

22
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,040
I can give you 30 minutes.

23
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,700
We can make that work!

24
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,800
The wedding will go on just in a slightly pared-down version.

25
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,760
Claire, you're up front.

26
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,830
Flower girl, strewing.

27
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,160
Grooms, come with me.

28
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,120
"Ooh! Ahh! They look so handsome!"

29
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,780
Quartet, quartet, quartet!

30
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,500
And cue Sal. Start after your limerick.

31
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, God, no!

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,020
Ugh! We're all making sacrifices, dear.

33
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,150
I have a Prius full of monarch butterflies

34
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,320
who are apparently coming home with me.

35
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,040
Aah! No!

36
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,930
Her water broke!

37
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,880
No! No, it did not! I am barely pregnant!

38
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,070
Thank you all for being here on this joyous occasion.

39
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,340
There once was a homo named Tucker --

40
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,090
Sal, stop. No, you're going into labor!

41
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,920
Also, just stop!

42
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,370
But we've only been together four months.

43
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,050
I just love you so much,

44
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,790
I can't wait to have your baby.

45
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,100
God! Kids ruin everything!

46
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,060
Yeah, they sure do.

47
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,010
Let's get you to the hospital and have our miracle baby.

48
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,820
Okay.

49
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,030
Just so you know,

50
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,150
sometimes when babies come this early...

51
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,230
...they're black.

52
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,740
Okay, this is a disaster!

53
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,290
We have no one to marry us!

54
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,530
Dearly beloved, that is a problem.

55
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,480
Yep.

56
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,820
Thanks to $35 and the internet,

57
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,430
you are looking at

58
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,910
the good reverend Phillip Humphrey Dunphy.

59
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,850
Over the last year, I've dropped a few subtle hints

60
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,900
to Mitch and Cam that I was available.

61
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,070
Hey, have you guys decided who's gonna officiate your wedding?

62
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,430
'cause I got ordained online.

63
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,280
Oh, my God. A wallaby!

64
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,240
Oh, my gosh!

65
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,390
To be continued!

66
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,350
Phil, you're a lifesaver. Thank you.

67
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,040
No thanks necessary.

68
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,190
Cameron, marrying you would

69
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,230
make me the happiest man on earth.

70
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,390
Everyone, attention, please!

71
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,620
I've been informed by the fire chief

72
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,370
we need to leave immediately!

73
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,170
- The winds have shifted! - What?

74
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,660
But w-we have 30 minutes!

75
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,080
A fellow wedding facilitator has informed me

76
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,880
a beautiful space just became available.

77
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,710
To the shuttles!

78
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,770
But we don't know a thing about this place.

79
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,830
Oh, my mistake.

80
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,800
Let's go over it.

81
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,210
It's a quaint, rustic spot,

82
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,410
though its chief selling point

83
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,150
is it's not about to become a kiln!

84
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,530

Cam, where are the shuttles

90
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,730
that brought everyone up from the parking lot?

91
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,700
Apparently they were double booked.

92
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,570
This is the best Pepper could do.

93
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,310
This is how we're getting everyone to the wedding?

94
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
Half our guests are gay.

95
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,140
We're finally giving them

96
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,000
a good memory on a school bus.

97
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,410
That doesn't look completely sewn on.

98
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,680
You might want to get something to cover that.

99
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
Oh, good idea.

100
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,000
Thank you.

101
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,550
What did you say to Merle that make him want to leave Barb?

102
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,350
I have no idea!

103
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,820
We were just shooting the breeze --

104
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,040
Wedding day, DeDe,

105
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,750
how happy I am now that I'm with you.

106
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,570
Why would you say something like that?

107
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,500
Now you're breaking somebody's heart.

108
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,360
I didn't mean for her to get hurt.

109
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,050
Not her, him when he realizes

110
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,500
that not every second wife looks like this.

111
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,020
Thank you for lending me your jacket, Jay.

112
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,260
It's good to know there are still gentlemen in the world.

113
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,340
Oh, it's you, Barb.

114
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,750
I didn't see you there on account of

115
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,060
my bright future.

116
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,660
Thank you, Gloria.

117
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,350
Standing up to that old goat

118
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,940
was best thing I ever did.

119
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,960
What's all that about?

120
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,100
No, no. The thing is that she told me a story about a goat

121
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,610
and it's very old and then the goat --

122
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,300
Oh, don't give me that.

123
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,070
I told her to express herself.

124
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,340
I believe that in a good marriage,

125
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:47,840
a woman can ex--

126
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Fine. Whatever. I'll undo it.

127
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,190
We can't let Cam know what the situation with his parents is.

128
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,920
He's very delicate.

129
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,230
I can't believe I'm involved

130
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,140
in breaking up yet another marriage.

131
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,030
What?

132
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,180
Hey, hey. How you holding up?

133
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,370
Uh, I've had better days.

134
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,190
But you and me -- we're cool, right?

135
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,040
We probably have some things that we should talk about,

136
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,800
but maybe we save it for a less-stressful day.

137
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,590
This is not your fault, by the way.

138
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,840
the fire was an act of God.

139
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,840
Not that God sent a fireball down

140
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,360
to keep a couple guys from getting married, but, uh...

141
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,510
I didn't say that right.

142
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,410
There's no way that this -- any of this --

143
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,730
is part of God's plan.

144
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,900
Save something for the toast, dad.

145
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,980
Damn it.

146
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,250
Where do you want this?

147
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,270
Bus five. What's wrong with your voice?

148
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,870
The three of us just took a road trip.

149
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,000
We sang Broadway tunes

150
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,690
all the way to the Texas border.

151
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,040
And then from the other side of Texas to Florida.

152
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,070
Hey, so you're, like, the minister?

153
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,560
Kinda. When they lost Sal,

154
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,050
the situation was a no-brainer,

155
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,340
which made them think of me.

156
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Isn't there a lot you have to remember to marry people?

157
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,600
Not really. They all follow the same basic pattern.

158
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,130
"We're gathered here today to join these two

159
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,060
"in holy matrimony.

160
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,350
Do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse?"

161
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,250
And the first person says --

162
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,440
- I do? - Right.

163
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,730
Then I ask the second person,

164
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,400
"Do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse?"

165
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,760
- You know the drill, right? - I do.

166
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,040
Then I say, "By the powers vested in me

167
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
by the state of California,

168
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,170
I now pronounce you legally wed."

169
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,530
Bingo, bango, bongo, you're married.

170
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,450
Awesome.

171
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,840
Really awesome.

172
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,450
Look, Barb, I know what you're going through.

173
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,210
You and Merle are at a crossroads in your marriage.

174
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,850
It feels like the end of the world,

175
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,190
but in time, you'll see it more as a --

176
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,460
Right.

177
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,380
A little hiccup that we all go through.

178
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,160
My advice -- don't do anything.

179
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,390
Just take some time and breathe.

180
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,860
Maybe through your nose.

181
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,670
Did you happen to find anything in one of my pockets?

182
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,620
Funny you should "Flask."

183
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,570
Maybe I'll just take that.

184
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,620
Excuse me.

185
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,690
Well, it's much lighter now, isn't it?

186
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,630
Yeah.

187
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,980
Okay, this is weird.

188
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,000
I think this is the same seat I used to nervously scratch at

189
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,000
on my way to school.

190
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,540
Oh, poor thing.

191
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,430
Yeah.

192
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,120
Even then I felt such pressure to be perfect.

193
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,330
Andy's flight is delayed again.

194
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,340
Okay. That was close.

195
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,710
We almost connected on a human level.

196
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,860
He's doing the dumbest thing.

197
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,050
His girlfriend broke up with him,

198
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,200
and he's flying out to win her back.

199
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,510
That sounds so romantic.

200
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,630
It's so weak.

201
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,950
This girl throws a fit, he goes running.

202
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,360
If they get back together, she has all the power.

203
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,330
Oh, my god. You like him.

204
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,430
No, I don't. What?

205
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,460
This is so hilarious.

206
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,680
He's totally not your type.

207
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,610
Shut up.

208
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,730
Please. You can't stop thinking about him, you're checking on him.

209
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,140
He's not even like a real person.

210
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,400
He's like a muppet.

211
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,120
I don't even get some of Sal's remarks here.

212
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,620
"Marriage is like a freeway --

213
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,900
Messy, but if you communicate, it's so worth it."

214
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,340
Honey, that does not say "Freeway."

215
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,670
I can't use any of this,

216
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,660
but I don't want the whole ceremony to be generic.

217
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,480
There needs to be some magic in it.

218
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Well, you can read a poem or maybe --

219
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,440
Hold on. Back up.

220
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,210
I like your last idea -- a magic trick.

221
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,200
I did not suggest a magic trick.

222
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,950
After all, what's better than magic

223
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,210
to symbolize the wonder of marriage?!

224
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,320
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

225
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah, yeah.

226
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,310
They looked good on you in the store,

227
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,640
but now you're not sure.

228
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,450
That was the topic 10 minutes ago.

229
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,280
Well, maybe if I stapled the sports page to my head,

230
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,240
you'd pay attention.

231
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,850
As long as it covered your mouth.

232
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,190
- What? - Nothing.

233
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,860
Ugh, when are we going to be there?

234
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,790
Soon, honey. Very soon.

235
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,150
Come on. Give us a smile.

236
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,270
Remember, this is the happiest day

237
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,920
of your dads' lives.

238
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,510
The butterflies are eating me!

239
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,630
Well, who told you to jostle the crate?!

240
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,180
Oh, blah. One got in my mouth.

241
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,910
What a bunch of babies.

242
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,610
Pepper said it was nice. I hope we like it.

243
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,140
Cam, Cam, listen, whatever's on the other side of this curtain,

244
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,320
we cannot be disappointed.

245
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,910
You're right.

246
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,640
Today is not about flowers or superficial things.

247
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,540
Right. Okay.

248
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,380
- Oh, thank god. - It's pretty. I was so scared!

249
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,790
Oh, I love it, I love it. I could cry!

250
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,690
Oh, don't cry. You'll streak your bronzer.

251
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,310
Everyone, please take your seats!

252
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,360
We'll be starting in cinco minutes,

253
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,700
10 at the most.

254
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,830
Do you ever notice with Ronaldo

255
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,860
how his language barrier sort of fluctuates?

256
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,600
How is this place even available?

257
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,070
Oh, dreadful story.

258
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,570
Runaway bride, suicidal groom, feuding families.

259
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,930
It really puts our mundane problems in perspective.

260
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,260
Oh, we can't dim the lights.

261
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,150
Then break some.

262
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,790
These are not young men!

263
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,440
Why don't you two go freshen up?

264
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,170
Wait.

265
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,940
Why am I seeing only half a quartet?

266
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,480
Ed and jim are volunteer firemen.

267
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
Of course they are.

268
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,330
Try to play in front of a mirror.

269
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,520
- A kiss for luck. - Oh, okay. Yes.

270
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,180
A kiss for luck, my little gingersnap!

271
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,510
Oh, okay. Oh, wow, barb.

272
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,250
Oh, oh, good thing we're out of the fire zone.

273
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,830
Well, you know your dad gave me a little wedding helper.

274
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,450
I didn't know the jacket still had a --

275
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,360
Flask. Yeah. Oh, that's nice.

276
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,510
You know, at the end of the ceremony,

277
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,140
I kiss a man,

278
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,260
so you might want to fill 'er up.

279
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,660
This is how you try to fix things?

280
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,020
- You get her drunk? - Don't blame him.

281
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,080
She's been a loose cannon

282
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
ever since she started going

283
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,890
to that church service that starts at 10:30.

284
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,390
They play guitar music.

285
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,080
It's a celebration.

286
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,610
It's gomorrah.

287
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,660
The pastor wears one of them madonna microphones.

288
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,180
Oh, madonna microphones.

289
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,380
Where's my little corn silk?

290
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,020
Hey, you want to go out and do something fun after this thing?

291
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,330
No, I was thinking about staying in tonight

292
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,570
and spending some time with joe.

293
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,080
Ugh, you never want to do anything

294
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,850
since that baby came along.

295
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,050
- How are you? - I'm good.

296
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,200
You -- you have the, um --

297
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,390
Marriage license, rings, signing pen, toast?

298
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:15,990
Yes, of course.

299
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,660
There's a reason I'm the best person.

300
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,440
You know that's just a title for today, right?

301
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,390
Yeah, I'm the best person at this wedding.

302
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm still kind of hearing -- what is that?

303
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,640
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

304
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,580
Wait. Oh.

305
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,640
That's pollen. Oh, no.

306
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,780
- Honey. - Don't look at me.

307
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,990
I only had one corsage.

308
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,010
Where's your sister?

309
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,580
Haley?

310
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,870
Andy! You're still here?

311
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,740
Yeah.

312
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,150
My flight keeps getting delayed because of weather.

313
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,510
Oh, so does the wedding.

314
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,290
Wait. Is fire weather?

315
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,110
- There was a fire? - Yeah.

316
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,680
Guess that explains that smoking dress.

317
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,020
Line, Andy.

318
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,440
Well, if you're -- if you're just killing time,

319
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,220
the new wedding venue is nearby.

320
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,190
You could totally come and hang.

321
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,370
I don't think I'm exactly dressed for it.

322
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,220
Of course, if I was with you,

323
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,720
no one would even look at me.

324
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,410
Wow, okay.

325
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,980
That is quite enough pie for you, young man.

326
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,360
Ugh. I've got to get back.

327
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,560
Um, look, I didn't come here for coffee.

328
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,710
Andy, I don't think it's a good idea

329
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,740
for you to get on that plane.

330
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,370
I don't think Beth is worth it.

331
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,790
You don't even know Beth.

332
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,930
I think I do.

333
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,390
I think I've been her.

334
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,450
Let me guess.

335
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,840
For every 10 letters you write, she writes one.

336
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,780
She's always the one who ends the phone call.

337
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,380
You happen to mention when your birthday's coming up

338
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,710
because you know deep down she's already forgotten it.

339
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,810
Meanwhile, she gives you just enough to keep you on the hook.

340
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,840
Hello?

341
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,330
Of course I didn't leave, mom.

342
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,570
You walked past me two seconds ago.

343
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,330
I'm just saying, you deserve better.

344
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,830
Oh, my god!

345
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,340
I'm waving at you!

346
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,070
Stay where you are!

347
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,540
I'm walking towards you!

348
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,880
Lily, here you go. I'm taking your corsage.

349
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,080
But it's mine.

350
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,800
You're the flower girl.

351
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,440
It's part of your job.

352
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,610
Read the fine print. Thank you.

353
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,060
- Claire! - What?

354
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,260
I-I need the rings.

355
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,570
- For what? - To practice our trick.

356
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,380
Come on, come on, come on.

357
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,270
Oh, honey, I don't know about the magic trick.

358
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,250
Don't you think people should be

359
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,770
focused on Cam and Mitch?

360
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,040
I'm hoping so. It's the perfect misdirect.

361
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,540
Okay, here's how we're gonna do this.

362
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,940
- You hold the rings. - Okay.

363
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,070
I say, "They say the best marriages

364
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,880
contain just a little bit of magic."

365
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,090
We hold up our arms.

366
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,120
You let go of the rings.

367
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,430
They slide down the thread

368
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,240
as if mysteriously floating

369
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,970
all the way -- half the way to me.

370
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,110
Merle, I know that after talking to Jay,

371
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,880
you think that there are better things out there for you.

372
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,410
Who says there isn't?

373
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,160
Okay.

374
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,020
Take a trip with me to the future.

375
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,670
It's a regular night at the local honky tonk.

376
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,710
Look, who's that man sitting alone in the bar?

377
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,260
It's Merle.

378
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,290
A beautiful woman approaches.

379
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,550
She asks, "Is this seat taken?"

380
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,170
He says, "No," and then she grabs the chair

381
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,510
and goes sits next to a much younger,

382
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:09,050
much handsomer-looking man.

383
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,170
Then Merle turns around to the bartender

384
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,710
And say, "Happy Tuesday, huh?"

385
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,800
The bartender replies,

386
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,000
"Don't you mean 'Merry Christmas'?"

387
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,690
You see, Merle?

388
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,070
It was Christmas the whole time!

389
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,760
Okay, it's show time. Cue the processional.

390
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,480
Phil, as they say in my native South Carolina,

391
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,500
it's time to marry your brother-in-law.

392
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,430
Flower girl, work those petals.

393
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,490
Wedding party walking.

394
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,860
What's that?

395
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,220
I'll be right there.

396
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,810
Okay. Last looks.

397
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,130
Very handsome.

398
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,690
This is my second favorite suit of yours.

399
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,380
Second?

400
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,760
Right after your birthday suit.

401
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,650
Hey. Cut it out. I'm practically a married man.

402
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,870
I know.

403
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,800
You know, you scared me earlier with what your dad said.

404
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,670
W-what?

405
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,850
Well, just about the fire, you know...

406
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,810
being a sign we shouldn't get married.

407
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,790
It was kind of apocalypticy.

408
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,470
- No. - Then the sky turned dark.

409
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,800
Yeah, because of the fire.

410
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,840
Well, and then we had a flood.

411
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,680
You know, Sal -- sploosh.

412
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,070
I think you're stretching just a little bit.

413
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,060
Because we paid for this room!

414
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,440
Mr. and Mrs. Lucas, we just need 20 minutes!

415
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,660
Cut the boy soprano.

416
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,580
No, we need these people out of here!

417
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,640
I can see you want to run again, don't you?

418
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,820
Follow your heart.

419
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,510
On your mark, get set, live, baby!

420
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,560
You don't need that!

421
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,610
You don't see this as another biblical sign?

422
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,220
A swarm of "Lucases."

423
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,790
Slight change, everyone!

424
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,670
Don't worry!

425
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,550
There's always a plan "C"!

426
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,110
Oh! They're everywhere!

427
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,820
What is wrong with you people?

428
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,760
Leave the box alone!

429
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,710
Oh, if that thing is coming in,

430
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,070
we need to put a few more people on the lawn.

431
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,800
Okay, this place is cozy, right?

432
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,420
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,640
It's fine. It's -- oh, it's going to be fine.

434
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:51,960
Although we may need to

436
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,440
sit some of the overflow guests upstairs.

437
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,150
Oh, we don't -- we don't own the upstairs.

438
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,000
Really?

439
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,950
I always assumed there was a nicer part

440
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,310
you weren't showing me.

441
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,400
Make sure their checks have cleared.

442
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,360
Just get another caterer here

443
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,880
or these people will be eating butterfly bisque!

444
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,100
Okay, I'm trying to remain calm,

445
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,250
but you realize that's another sign of the apocalypse, right?

446
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,060
Famine?

447
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,670
He sounds as bad as Steven, Stefan,

448
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,390
and Longines.

449
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,450
Oh, so what you're saying

450
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,960
is we have four hoarse men?

451
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,430
Stop with the frowning.

452
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,990
Today, you smile for your son.

453
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,790
Tomorrow, you can do whatever you want.

454
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,690
Tomorrow, I might just move out.

455
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,790
Oh, now I feel a smile coming on.

456
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,750
Oh, my god. You're texting Andy now?

457
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,340
I'm just letting him know he can hang out here if he wants.

458
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,130
Haley, I hope you know what you're doing.

459
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,500
I'm not doing anything.

460
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,680
I mean, it's one thing if you're actually into him,

461
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,570
but if you're just playing around with him

462
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,640
for the fun of it...

463
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,970
Here's the thing about nice, quiet dorks like Andy.

464
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,930
You get over us much faster than

465
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,030
we get over you.

466
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,920
Hi. Sorry. So sorry.

467
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,960
Excuse me. It's my husband.

468
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,210
"They say the best marriages" --

469
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,350
I don't mean to rush you,

470
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,490
but there's like 80 people waiting to get in here.

471
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,510
No, no, no. I'm so glad you're here.

472
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,110
I just worked up a new magic trick.

473
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,220
I start by saying, "They say the best marriages

474
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,080
contain just a little bit of magic."

475
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,810
Then in my sleeves, I've rigged two confetti poppers

476
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,380
that I found in Lily's closet.

477
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,620
So when I raise my arms...

478
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,320
Really? You're not gonna say, "Don't do that"?

479
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,660
No, I mean, I don't think you need the magic trick,

480
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,770
but if you do it, I'm sure you'll be great.

481
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,920
Oh, honey.

482
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,030
Oh, god, let me get that. Honey! No!

483
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,470
Honey, no! Hey!

484
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,890
Phil! Oh, no!

485
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,480
No, no, water's on! Water's on!

486
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,680
No! You --

487
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,670
-Just a minute. - Just a minute.

488
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,180
-Hey Andy. - Hey.

489
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,730
Has the wedding started yet?

490
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,350
Oh, yeah, lots of times.

491
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,490
-What's up? - Oh, nothing.

492
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,970
Hey, that thing you said before about me deserving better,

493
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,300
you just meant, like, in general, right?

494
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,720
You weren't thinking of anyone in particular?

495
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,490
Yeah, no, I-I just meant you deserve to be happy.

496
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,810
And if it's this girl, great.

497
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,910
If not, great.

498
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,130
Um, sometimes the hardest part

499
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,870
is just figuring out what you want.

500
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,590
Yeah, that's what I thought.

501
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,650
Well, enjoy the wedding.

502
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,310
Thanks. Have a nice trip.

503
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,430
Yeah. I'll see you.

504
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm so glad we did this.

505
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,870
I know. Who were we kidding?

506
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,230
It was so gonna happen.

507
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,350
I can't get enough of this.

508
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,670
No, Mitch is fine. Still mad at me, though.

509
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,320
You know how touchy he can be, Dede.

510
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,570
Remember when we tried to cheer him up

511
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,860
after his first ice-skating competition?

512
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,190
How were we supposed to know third place is a good thing?

513
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,120
Remember he tromped off

514
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,210
across that muddy field in his skates?

515
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,020
He sunk like a woolly mammoth.

516
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,600
Hey, Dede, if you're around the fourth of July,

517
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,710
you should come by and watch the wedding video.

518
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,810
No, we're out of town in August.

519
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,910
All right. Well, soon. Okay.

520
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,610
Oh, Dede, I don't think I have your new --

521
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,280
Okay, it's magic time, everyone!

522
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,540
Phil, please take your place beneath our majestic arch.

523
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,090
Cue the quartet.

524
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,600
Where's the other one?

525
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,960
He rode with the caterer who flipped his truck.

526
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,340
Why do good things happen to everyone but me?

527
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,680
Let's send the flower girl

528
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,510
before she's a flower teenager.

529
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,710
Oh, so sad.

530
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,590
Sorry.

531
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,260
- What is ... - Yeah. Like I'm the problem.

532
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,610
Is your dad here?

533
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,860
Yeah, he should be right --

534
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,520
Oh -- oh, my god.

535
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
He's out on the sidewalk on the phone.

536
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,390
Do you want me to go get him?

537
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,760
No, no, I don't. Let's just -- come on.

538
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
Let's just do this.

539
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,060
Mitchell.

540
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,450
Is this really how you want to get married?

541
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,510
Well, it's not ideal.

542
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,270
No, people don't have any rice to throw

543
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,380
because they're chewing it raw out of starvation.

544
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,370
Half of our guests are on the lawn and...

545
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,160
There go the sprinklers.

546
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,700
Okay, let's just call time of death on this.

547
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,000
All right, yeah.

548
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,300
Hey, everybody, um, thank you so much

549
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,370
for, uh, for dealing with all this today.

550
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,270
It means a lot to us.

551
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,200
But unfortunately, this is not gon--

552
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,970
Stop. You can't do this.

553
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,790
I'm way ahead of you, dad,

554
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,880
and thank you for stopping by.

555
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,990
What I mean is, you can't get married like this.

556
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,390
You two deserve the kind of wedding

557
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,030
you've been talking about nonstop

558
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,280
for the last nine months.

559
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,090
What do you mean?

560
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,300
You bring it up every chance that you get.

561
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,850
I know what nonstop means!

562
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,200
Trust me, okay?

563
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,130
Now, what are we all standing around for?

564
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,320
My son's getting married today.

565
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,860
All right, Jay.

566
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,620
It's what this golf club needs.

567
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,480
Shake it up a little.

568
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,250
Go on, dear.

569
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,330
How often do your fathers get married?

570
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,490
So far, one, two...

571
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,040
Why am I still seeing you?

572
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,400
You can take your seat, dad.

573
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,500
We're about to start.

574
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,130
Actually, I thought you and I would take a little walk.

575
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,990
I remember it like it was yesterday --

576
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,550
The day that Mitchell came home from the hospital

577
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,000
in a very unfashionable white diaper

578
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,140
with three strands of scraggly raggedy andy hair.

579
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,420
If he's doing it, I'm doing it.

580
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,650
You coming, Barb?

581
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,970
You old sweet talker.

582
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,430
Wait for me!

583
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,190
We were inseparable.

584
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,680
I was his big sister,

585
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,560
his big brother, his nemesis,

586
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,290
his protector, his best friend.

587
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,860
I was his first partner.

588
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,130
And I loved every minute of it.

589
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,470
Thank you all for being here on this happy occasion.

590
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,800
They say the best marriages contain just a little bit of magic.

591
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,570
Believe me.

592
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,290
I know.

593
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,230
We're gathered here today to join two amazing people.

594
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,290
So naturally, I was a little picky

595
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,390
when it came to who was going to be replacing me,

596
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,380
And then I met this Cam.

597
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,530
And sure, he was warm and funny and loving.

598
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,360
Cameron, do you take Mitchell to be your husband?

599
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,280
I do.

600
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,000
Cameron, would you please place this ring on Mitchell's finger?

601
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,070
Mitchell, do you take Cameron to be your husband?

602
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,950
I do.

603
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,610
Then by the powers vested in me by the state of California,

604
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,100
I am privileged to pronounce you spouses for life.

605
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,420
You may now kiss your husband.

606
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,470
I wondered,

607
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,570
"Was he really

608
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,910
everything I wanted for my brother?

609
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,460
Was he really the best person?"

610
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,710
No, I'm the best person.

611
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,700
And now I am very pleased to raise a glass

612
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,740
And introduce for the first time ever --

613
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,070
on our fourth try --

614
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,030
great husbands, Mitch and Cam.

615
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,810
Yes!

616
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,920
I saw that.

617
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,780
What?

618
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,580
The way you look at my sister.

619
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,700
You do it all the time, you know.

620
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,750
I do not.

621
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,470
Just not in front of me, okay?

622
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,590
So, have you heard from your dads on their honeymoon?

623
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,140
You must really miss them, don't you?

624
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,020
Sorry. I was being dramatic.

625
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,260
No, you were right.

626
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,440
You'll hate yourself.

627
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,440
Right again.

628
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,720
It's like they never left.
