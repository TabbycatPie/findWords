<i>Round the curve they go!</i>

169
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,340
<i>Leclerc is on the inside!
Hamilton goes onto the gravel!</i>

170
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,720
<i>And you can hear the cheers from Monza!</i>

171
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,980
[all cheering]

172
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,820
<i>The Ferrari fans loved it!</i>

173
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,300
<i>Mercedes threw everything at him today.</i>

174
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,680
<i>Charles Leclerc has coped brilliantly!
He won in Spa! He wins in Monza!</i>

175
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,920
[Charles shouting] Yes! Yes! Yes!

176
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,240
[all cheering]

177
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,500
[commentator 1] <i>Charles Leclerc is the
winner of the 2019 Italian Grand Prix.</i>

178
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,060
<i>How about that?</i>

179
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,100
[crowd chanting] Ferrari!
Ferrari! Ferrari!

180
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,040
[Martin] <i>No, you are not dreaming.</i>

181
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,440
<i>You've just won the Italian Grand Prix
wearing that infamous red suit.</i>

182
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,140
[Charles] Yes!

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,560
[all cheering]

184
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,120
- [engineer 2] <i>P13.</i>
- [Sebastian] Okay, copy.

185
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,260
I took myself out of the race
in the beginning. Sorry for that.

186
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,540
[chanting] Ferrari! Ferrari! Ferrari!

187
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,080
[Charles in Italian] <i>Winning here
is ten times more emotional</i>

188
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,000
<i>than winning anywhere else.</i>

189
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,480
Thanks to all of you.
I don't have the words.

190
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,620
[journalist in English] Sebastian, I guess
it was just one of those days.

191
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,360
Well, not a particularly good one, no.

192
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,080
[crowd cheering]

193
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,540
[announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Charles Leclerc!</i>

194
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,580
[Charles] <i>To see so many people
was just absolute madness.</i>

195
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,816
It was probably the best day of my life.

196
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,420
[all cheering]

197
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,640
For Seb, Monza was frustrating,
because when you do a mistake,

198
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,240
and it was his own mistake,
it's always frustrating.

199
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,840
<i>I think certainly there is
a natural rivalry between the teammates.</i>

200
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,160
[Charles] <i>Seb's obviously the first person
you want to beat...</i>

201
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,880
because at the end,
he's the only person on the grid

202
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,500
that has the same car as yourself.

203
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,400
[Will] <i>If Seb thought that
it was going to be</i>

204
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,260
<i>a traditional master
and apprentice narrative,</i>

205
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,240
he's had a bit of a rude awakening.

206
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,500
[indistinct chatter]

207
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,860
<i>Seeing how quickly Leclerc developed
in his debut season with Ferrari...</i>

208
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,500
there is a massive prospect for fireworks.

209
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,120
[Martin] <i>Look at that!
Charles Leclerc flying out in front.</i>

210
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,320
<i>You can't restrain him!</i>

211
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,760
[engineer] <i>Charles, box. Box now.</i>

212
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,396
[commentator] <i>Ferrari have brought
Leclerc to pit,</i>

213
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,540
<i>that could give Vettel the advantage.</i>

214
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,780
<i>That was a quick stop for Leclerc,</i>

215
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,440
<i>but was it quick enough
to get out in front of his teammate?</i>

216
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,640
<i>Vettel's coming down the pit straight.</i>

217
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,680
<i>Vettel's gonna get ahead of Leclerc here,
there he is!</i>

218
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,300
[Charles] What the hell?

219
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,420
[engineer] <i>Charles,
it was the best thing we could do.</i>

220
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,180
[Charles] To be honest with you,
I don't understand at all.

221
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,960
[Martin] <i>Right at the front,
Sebastian Vettel leading for Ferrari.</i>

222
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,140
<i>Sebastian Vettel takes the checkered flag</i>

223
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,680
<i>and wins the Singapore Grand Prix!</i>

224
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,060
[crowd whistling and cheering]

225
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,400
[journalist] Was this scenario
discussed before the race?

226
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Uh, no. No.

227
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,040
[Martin] <i>Leclerc leads, Sebastian Vettel
pulls over to the right hand side</i>

228
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,640
<i>and takes the lead!</i>

229
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,020
[commentator] <i>Leclerc will be
absolutely fuming.</i>

230
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,880
[Charles] Just for me to understand,
the situation was pretty clear, right?

231
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,040
[engineer 1] <i>Yes, Sebastian
will let you by next lap.</i>

232
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,020
[engineer 1] <i>Let Charles by.
Let Charles by.</i>

233
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,020
[Sebastian] Let's break away
for another two laps.

234
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,980
- [Charles] Well?
- [engineer 2] <i>Sebastian, let Charles by.</i>

235
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,480
[Sebastian] You can tell him to close up.

236
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,340
[Charles] You put me behind,
and I respected everything,

237
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,960
but now it's difficult to close the gap,
obviously. We'll speak later.

238
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,540
[Will] <i>Every world champion has
what I term an "inner bastard,"</i>

239
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,440
and it is that ability to make
the tough decision when you have to.

240
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,520
<i>Ayrton Senna once said, "If you no longer
go for a gap that exists,</i>

241
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,200
<i>you're no longer a racing driver."</i>

242
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,340
But for a driver like Sebastian,
that gap doesn't have to be physical.

243
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,040
It's a weakness,
it's a chink in the armor of your rival,

244
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,520
<i>and you take it, no matter what.</i>

245
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,360
<i>I think Charles is developing it.</i>

246
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,900
<i>But he is biding his time
playing the long game.</i>

247
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,220
[Silvia] Hello, everybody.
Now, a couple of things.

248
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,960
Seb versus Charles. There was a big
feature today in <i>La Gazzetta</i>

249
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,540
again saying you are against each other,

250
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,540
but I think they just need
to fill some space.

251
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,960
- [man] Yeah.
- [Silvia] We know you love each other,

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,800
so just tell people...

253
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,500
- You can occasionally kiss if you want to.
- No.

254
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,460
[all laughing]

255
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,640
I will not go that far.

256
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,260
- [Sebastian] We'll start by holding hands.
- [Silvia] Okay.

257
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,180
All right.

258
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,360
[Karun] <i>We're gonna see drivers
pushing out there today.</i>

259

[commentator] <i>Charles Leclerc is a man</i>

260
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,360
<i>who conceivably you think
could be on pole later on today.</i>

261
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,460
[engineer] <i>Try to increase the gap
to Magnussen in front.</i>

262
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,480
<i>And it will be mode push for last corner,
mode push.</i>

263
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,780
<i>Magnussen in front...</i>

264
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,500
[Charles] Something wrong with the engine.

265
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
[engineer] <i>Slow button on.
Slow button on.</i>

266
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,240
<i>Stop the car. Stop the car.</i>

267
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,960
[Martin] <i>Leclerc has pulled off
the circuit in the Ferrari.</i>

268
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,560
[engineer] <i>Engine off. Engine off.</i>

269
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,316
- [Charles] I'll get out of the car.
- [engineer] <i>Copy.</i>

270
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,680
[Martin] <i>And that is session over
for Charles Leclerc.</i>

271
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,400
[Martin] <i>It'll be a tough two hours
till qualifying.</i>

272
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,096
[Mattia] <i>You have no time,
really, to analyze.</i>

273
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,540
<i>You just need to react.</i>

274
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,060
<i>We need to make sure
that the car is ready for the quali.</i>

275
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,500
<i>Two hours is very little time
to change a full power unit.</i>

276
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,400
[Karun] <i>There's still smoke coming out
of the airbox.</i>

277
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,940
<i>So much heat!</i>

278
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,700
- [in Italian] You know we lost oil.
- What?

279
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,460
Okay.

280
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,180
Something happened with the engine.

281
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,900
Stay in place.

282
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,540

Leclerc's car is ready to go.</i>

283
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,260

getting that new power unit in.</i>

284
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,880
[commentator 2] <i>They've had to use
an older, used engine in the car.</i>

285
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,760
[Mattia] Sorry for Charles' morning.

286
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,700
But try to be sharp.
It will be very tight in the afternoon.

287
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,100
Let's enjoy. Today is the qualifying day.

288
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,780

[presenter] Let's go back
a few races to Singapore.

00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,480
I'm... I don't know, I love the sport,

330
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,860
I love the number sides of it as well.

331
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,340
I'm always thinking that one day
I'll be in my rocking chair,

332
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,920
fat and chubby and old,
and then I can tell my kids, like,

333
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,580
"Look..." You know? "Look at the numbers."

334
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,520
[crowd laughing and clapping]

335
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,660
[Martin] <i>It's the Unites States Grand Prix
at the Circuit of the Americas.</i>

336
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,240
<i>Lewis Hamilton can clinch the championship</i>

337
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,000

with a good result today.</i>

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,880
[indistinct chatter]

339
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,100
What's up, bro? Congrats! You all right?

340
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,200
[Martin] <i>Ferrari are strangely becalm
so far this weekend.</i>

341
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,840
<i>They're not on pole position.</i>

342
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,040
<i>They are on the front row
with Sebastian Vettel.</i>

343
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,700
<i>They're on the second row
with Charles Leclerc.</i>

344
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,020
<i>But we've got an interesting race
ahead of us.</i>

345
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,476
[Mattia] <i>We know
it will be very difficult.</i>

346
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,640
<i>We know our competitors are strong.</i>

347
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,680
<i>They're very strong.</i>

348
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,900
<i>But as Ferrari,
I think that there are no limits.</i>

349
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,880
[commentator] <i>Leclerc has really burst
onto the scene this year</i>

350
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,160
<i>and Vettel maybe has had
his nose put out of joint a bit.</i>

351
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,260
[imperceptible]

352
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,120
- [in French] Good race.
- Thank you.

353
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,480
[Will in English] <i>Ferrari, they are going
through a re-building process.</i>

354
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,800
But when you are fighting
against a team like Mercedes,

355
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,440
<i>can you have a driver war...</i>

356
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,240
that doesn't run the risk of imploding?

357
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,860
[man and women

[Will] <i>Sebastian Vettel,
he sees his birthright.</i>

363
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,620
He sees his place as the number one.

00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,440
<i>"And I'll be damned if I'm gonna give
that position up to my rookie teammate...</i>

as being Ferrari's future."</i>

[Martin] <i>It's takeoff in Texas.</i>

368
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,860
<i>Decent start from Vettel,
but Verstappen's got a better one.</i>

369
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,000
[commentator 1] <i>Verstappen, he's already
wheel-to-wheel with Sebastian Vettel!</i>

370
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,140
<i>Verstappen has passed him.</i>

371
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,560
<i>Hamilton has passed him
and has made his way up into fourth place.</i>

372
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,340
<i>And you can hear the cheers of the crowd</i>

373
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,760
<i>who rather like that one,
thank you very much.</i>

374
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,920
[Sebastian] I've got some damage.
I don't know where from.

375
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,680
I didn't touch anything,
but I have understeer like crazy.

376
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,080
[Martin] <i>What's happening to Sebastian
Vettel out there? Has he got a problem?</i>

377

has now got past his teammate as well.</i>

378
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,256
[commentator 1] <i>Sebastian Vettel's
not happy about that.</i>

379
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,660
<i>He's coming back at Leclerc.</i>

380
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,380
<i>But Charles stays ahead,
and he's getting away.</i>

381
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,840
[in Italian] He overtook him.

382
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,580
[commentator 1 in English] <i>It's a lock up!
Vettel is pushing to the absolute limits.</i>

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,960

[Martin] <i>What's happened there?
Sebastian Vettel has massive problems!</i>

389
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,560
[Sebastian]<i> I think the suspension
just failed.</i>

390
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,920
<i>Yep, failed. Something broke.</i>

391
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,660
Yeah. I don't know what happened there.
Completely failed.

[engineer] <i>Try to avoid
the curb inside turn eight.</i>

393
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
[Charles] Why?

394
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,920
[engineer] <i>Just because Sebastian had
suspension failure there.</i>

395
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,740
<i>We are going plan B, but you need to try
to close the gap to Hamilton in front.</i>

396
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,400
[Charles] Yeah, copy.

399
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,380
[Charles] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pushing.

400
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,900

<i>You have done a good job. Really good job.</i>

409
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,060
[Charles sighs] Thanks, guys.

410
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,480
[Sebastian] <i>He's very fast.
I think he's proven many times.</i>

411
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,580
So he doesn't need to prove that anymore.

412
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,160
<i>As far as we are concerned
working for the team,</i>

413
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,820
I think we are pulling
in the same direction.

414
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,720
I accept the challenge.

pole positions.

<i>The dream is to try and build a long term
relationship with the team.</i>

420

421
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,560
[Mattia] <i>I think we're really at the start
of our journey.</i>

422
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,400
In order to win, sometimes,
you need as well to take some risks.

423
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,040
<i>We are all very convinced
on what we want to achieve.</i>

424
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,840
We will not hesitate to be brave
for the future.

425
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,680
[Sebastian] <i>In the end, it's all about...
All about winning.</i>

426
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,280
Competing against the best,
that's one thing.

428
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,180
Trying to do it with Ferrari
is another one.

429
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,680
[man 1] When are we getting
the Renault team jet?

430
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,180
When you do your first podium.

431
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,540
- [man 2] Ooh.
- [laughs]

432
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,860
- [man 3] What are your best moments?
- [man 4] That's a very short list.

433
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,540
I am very funny, also very good-looking.

434
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,760
Nico Hulkenberg!

435
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,320
- [Claire] Am I still in the lead?
- You are.

436
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,360
Oh! [laughs]

437
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,300
Should Sir Frank Williams'
sack his daughter?

438
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,400
I feel like an idiot.

439
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,480
[man 5] This is where I'm gonna
have my single life.

440
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,400
[man 6] What the hell did you do?

441
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,000
[man 7] <i>This is the best day of my life.</i>
