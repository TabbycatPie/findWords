OLDER TED: So, kids, there are
many buildings in New York City.

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,589
<i>Thousands of apartments.
Millions of stories.</i>

4
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:24,385
<i>And even though it's been decades,
and someone else lives there now,</i>

5
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:29,998
<i>there's one apartment in particular,
that will always be our apartment.</i>

6
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:32,414
<i>I have so many great memories
of that place.</i>

7
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:34,648
<i>Marshall playing video games.</i>

8
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,437
<i>Lily painting on the fire escape.</i>

9
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:42,181
- MAN: Hey!
- Sorry, Mr. Matson!

10
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:46,500
<i>And me making the coffee.
I had this coffee pot.</i>

11
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:51,055
<i>It was probably 50 years old at that time,
and it made truly terrible coffee.</i>

12
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:52,615
<i>We called it Shocky.</i>

13
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:56,516
- Plugging in.
- Saving game.

14
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:59,714
(GASPING)

15
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:02,508
<i>I loved every last detail of that place,</i>

16
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:05,568
<i>right down to the incredibly tacky swords
we hung on the wall.</i>

17
00:01:06,142 --> 00:01:09,604
<i>I never wanted any of it to change,
but that's not how life works.</i>

18
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:14,647
You guys will never believe
what just happened to us.

19
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:16,172
I don't even believe it myself.

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,636
We were in Queens
and we decided to stop by my apartment.

21
00:01:20,184 --> 00:01:21,414
Wait, her apartment?

22
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:23,773
I thought Aunt Lily lived with you
and Uncle Marshall.

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,079
I could see how you would think that,
but I have to have my own place.

24
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,557
It's an independence thing.

25
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:33,055
- When was the last time you were there?
- Three months ago.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,740
What? It's like fat pants.

27
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:39,339
You hope you never have to use them,
but you're glad to know they're there.

28
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:44,803
- What the hell?
- What?

29
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:47,592
This is my apartment.

30
00:01:47,592 --> 00:01:50,137
- Where?
- Right here!

31
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,192
What the hell?

32
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:55,877
Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.

33
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:58,984
No! No! This was my apartment!

34
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:03,918
My dresser was right... That's my dresser!

35
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:06,984
And this is my closet.

36
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:11,882
And I spilled nail polish there.
There's the stain!

37
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,566
Hi, how many?

38
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,969
- Lily!
- Yes. You know me?

39
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:20,773
Yeah, from your homecoming picture.
You're much prettier in the person.

40
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:24,893
Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake.

41
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,530
Where is my stuff?

42
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:30,089
It's all in the back.
We could wrap it up for you.

43
00:02:30,089 --> 00:02:31,695
You want it to go?

44
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:35,095
- This is my apartment.
- Not anymore.

45
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,229
No way. You're making this up.

46
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:41,117
Yeah, the building would've had
to give you some kind of notice.

47
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,115
They sent you a notice about this.

48
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:44,643
- When?
- Three month ago.

49
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:47,497
And here's your mail. Minus magazines.

50
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:53,112
Well, still, legally they can't just toss you
out on the street, you have a lease.

51
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:56,313
Okay, so I didn't have
a written lease as such.

52
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:58,983
But go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.

53
00:02:59,664 --> 00:03:01,661
She may be 98 years old, but she still...

54
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:05,280
She's dead, isn't she?

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,965
Never even saw the bus.

56
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:11,413
My apartment is a Chinese restaurant.

57
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:14,767
- What am I gonna do?
- Come live with us.

58
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,168
- Really?
- Of course.

59
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:19,321
- You sure about this, Ted?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,206
I mean, you basically live here anyway.
It's not like it'll change anything.

61
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:26,034
No, it's like it'll change everything!

62
00:03:26,034 --> 00:03:27,931
Oh, Ted! You are so screwed.

63
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,556
- What are you talking about?
- And why is that girl checking you out?

64
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:34,551
Because I look good.

65
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,519
BARNEY: Now focus.
You and Marshall are roommates.

66
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:40,448
You have an amazing apartment.
Marshall and Lily just got engaged.

67
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:42,206
Yeah. So?

68
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:45,342
So, you're not still gonna be his roommate
when he gets married, are you?

69
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,978
Someone's going to move out.
So, who's it going to be?

70
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,116
Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked
about who gets the apartment.

71
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:52,315
You've talked about
who gets the apartment, right?

72
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,720
Yeah, we've talked about it.

73
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:57,556
So, when Lily and I get married,

74
00:03:58,532 --> 00:04:01,385
- who's gonna get the apartment?
- That's a tough one.

75
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,607
You know who I think
could handle a problem like that?

76
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:09,415
- Who?
- Future Ted and Future Marshall.

77
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,905
Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.

78
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:16,042
Damn it, Past Ted!

79
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:18,944
You blew it, dude.

80
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,040
Now that Lily's there,
it's a whole new dynamic.

81
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:23,343
- They're edging you out.
- That's crazy.

82
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:25,309
They're not edging me out.
Marshall's my best friend.

83
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,231
One of my best friends.

84
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:30,785
He wouldn't do that to me.

85
00:04:31,955 --> 00:04:34,201
Just keep your eyes open.
That's all I'm saying, Teddy.

86
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:37,030
Little things are gonna be changing
around that apartment.

87
00:04:37,368 --> 00:04:39,088
Come on, Barney,
you're just being paranoid.

88
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,082
Okay, seriously, what is this girl's deal?

89
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:45,097
- Sort of on a date with her.
- What?

90
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:47,664
Yeah, yeah. I found her online.

91
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,267
I'm tired of the whole bar scene,
the one-night hookups.

92
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:54,833
I'm looking for a soul mate.

93
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,774
Someone who I can love and cuddle.

94
00:04:57,742 --> 00:04:59,239
Or, so it says in my profile.

95
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,393
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

96
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:07,991
But this girl, she wants the same stuff,
and it's bumming me out.

97
00:05:08,553 --> 00:05:10,238
All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.

98
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:11,688
- All right.
- You're going to the hospital?

99
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:13,965
No, see, he's gonna go back over there.
I'm gonna call him.

100
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,619
He's gonna pretend it's an emergency call...

101
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:16,964
from a family member at the hospital.

102
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,428
Oh, Lord! The fake emergency?

103
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:22,165
That is the lamest,
most pathetic cop-out in the book.

104
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,277
I expect more from you, Barney.

105
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:26,337
Well, stay tuned.
I'm working on some stuff.

106
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,489
But in the meantime, wish me luck.

107
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:33,387
So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?

108
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:36,025
He's gonna want the apartment.
I'm gonna want the apartment.

109
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,809
- It's gonna lead to an argument. So, no.
- That's real healthy.

110
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:44,513
So, when a serious issue comes up,
your response is just to avoid it?

111
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:46,944
I should really make this call.

112
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,037
Oh, can I do it?

113
00:05:53,822 --> 00:05:54,666
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

114
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,367
Excuse me.

115
00:05:57,114 --> 00:05:59,894
- Hello.
- Hi there, sexy.

116
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,796
- Hello, Aunt Kathy. What's up?
- Oh, nothing.

117
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:07,804
Just sitting here,
thinking about you, hot stuff.

118
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,847
An accident?

119
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:12,948
Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be okay?

120
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:17,773
Aunt Kathy's got an itch
that only you can scratch, big boy.

121
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:21,215
Oh, God!

122
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,211
Why did he think
he could build his own helicopter?

123
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,175
Come on, Daddy.

124
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:28,797
Break me off a piece
of that white chocolate.

125
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:32,993
Well, if he needs a transplant,
he can have mine.

126
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,202
I'll be right there.

127
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:36,940
You know, I...

128
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,158
(SOBBING)

129
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:42,400
See you guys later.

130
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,583
(SOBBING) Put it on my tab.

131
00:06:48,329 --> 00:06:52,259
This'll be nice.
The three of us living together.

132
00:06:53,293 --> 00:06:53,996
I think it's a good setup.

133
00:06:56,268 --> 00:06:57,282
Man, this coffee's great.

134
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:00,808
It's really great.

135
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:04,590
Too great.

136
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,043
What happened to Shocky?

137
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,430
(GASPS)...

138
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:21,838
- What's this?
- My coffee maker. From my apartment.

139
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:24,885
- Makes great coffee, right?
- Yeah, definitely.

140
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,580
I mean, so does Shocky.

141
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:31,386
Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee
tasted kind of rusty.

142
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,806
Yeah. No. It did.

143
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:36,377
I mean, I kind of like the rusty taste.

144
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:38,108
I'm used to it. I don't know.

145
00:07:39,373 --> 00:07:42,851
Also, Lily's coffee maker doesn't,
you know, shock people.

146
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,001
No, it's just...
You gotta admit that shock, that...

147
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:49,480
(GRUNTS) Wakes you up in the morning.

148
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:51,326
You know what else wakes you up
in the morning?

149
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:52,804
Coffee.

150
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:56,813
That's great. You're right.

151
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,965
Roomies! I love it.

152
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:04,334
They're edging me out.
They're totally edging me out.

153
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,107
- I didn't believe it, but you're right.
- Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.

154
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,525
Yeah. She got you a nice new coffee maker.

155
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:15,174
- How dare she?
- It's not just the coffee maker.

156
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:18,998
Done. The painting's done.

157
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,557
- That is great.
- Nice.

158
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:24,425
- Where do you wanna hang it?
- I don't know.

159
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,796
Over the piano?

160
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,683
Yeah, that would be a good place for it.

161
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:35,065
Too bad the swords are there.
We kind of love those swords.

162
00:08:36,862 --> 00:08:39,292
Well, those swords have been up there
a long time.

163
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,636
I know, right. I'd really miss them, too.

164
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:44,412
So maybe Marshall's room.

165
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:46,607
Okay.

166
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:51,352
He was gonna take the swords down!
Can you believe that?

167
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:53,785
Ted, why don't you just talk to him?
He's your best friend.

168
00:08:54,127 --> 00:08:56,020
That is I think.

169
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,157
One of your best friends.

170
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:02,290
The point is, maybe it's time
for some healthy communication.

171
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:06,280
Healthy communication?
That's the worst idea ever!

172
00:09:06,562 --> 00:09:08,639
Look, you held off their first advance.
That's good.

173
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,459
- Now, it's time to counterstrike.
- Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?

174
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:16,032
You gotta mark your territory.
And I don't mean missing the toilet.

175
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,983
You gotta do something big.

176
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:21,989
- What, like, buy a new sofa?
- Bigger.

177
00:09:23,383 --> 00:09:26,498
Katie's here. Okay, real quick.
Last night, epiphany.

178
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:28,370
I realized what the world of dating needs.

179
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,652
Ready? A lemon law.

180
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:34,250
- A lemon law, like for cars.
- Exactly.

181
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,831
From the moment the date begins,
you have five minutes to decide...

182
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:38,338
whether you're going
to commit to an entire evening.

183
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:41,092
And, if you don't, it's no hard feelings,
just, 'Good night.

184
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:43,148
'Thanks for playing. See you never.'

185
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:46,733
The lemon law. It's gonna be a thing.

186
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,617
Possibly starting right now.

187
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:56,684
- Hi, Katie. Barney.
- Hi! It's good to finally meet you.

188
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,187
Yeah. Katie, you are about to be
a part of history.

189
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,033
Tell your friends.

190

191
00:10:17,682 --> 00:10:21,601
Man, Ted's been acting weird.
He's started labeling all his food.

192
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,861
He even carved 'Ted'
into that block of cheese.

193
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,462
Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.

194
00:10:29,854 --> 00:10:34,547
- I think he's not cool with me moving in.
- No, that's not it.

195
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:37,047
I mean, you basically lived here all along.
Ted loves you.

196
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:40,865
- So, what's he PMS-ing about?
- I don't know.

197
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,438
But when he's ready to talk to me about it,
he'll come and talk to me about it.

198
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:47,933
Are you kidding?
You guys never talk about anything.

199
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:50,507
He'll just let it fester under the surface...

200
00:10:50,507 --> 00:10:52,472
until he does something big
and passive-aggressive.

201
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:54,127
You clearly don't know Ted.

Oh, awesome! It's great, right?

205
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:13,532
Yeah, I guess.
I'm just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.

206
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:16,387
Well, I like it.

207
00:11:16,796 --> 00:11:20,543
So, I'm just gonna keep it right here,
if that's cool.

208
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,641
Of course. I mean, we all live here,

209
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:27,282
so we should all be able to have things
the way we want them.

210

214
00:11:35,783 --> 00:11:42,205
So, I'm just gonna hang it
right here on the wall.

is a symbol of everything that's wrong...

All right, Marshall.

We're deciding right now
who gets this apartment.

238

May lead to an argument,
but we're settling this.

- Or we could flip a coin.
- Yeah, let's flip a coin.

- Flip it.
- Okay. I'm flipping it. Here I go.

241

- Flip it.
- Okay, here I go. I'll flip it.

242
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:15,394
- Flip it. Go ahead.
- I'm flipping!

243
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:17,831
Flip it.

244
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,734
But before I do,
I just want to say something.

245

You didn't even wanna move in here
in the first place.

was bad for your allergies.

That was five years ago.

248

antihistamines over the counter.

Okay, I'm flipping. Heads or tails?

- You don't need two rooms.
- Heads or tails, Marshall?

252

- Like you need two rooms.
- We might be starting a family soon.

Oh, no, you're not!

There's no way you're having a baby
while you're still in law school.

- It could be sooner.

you'll get a new roommate?

You know, he cooks naked.

260

Yeah, well, at least Barney
wouldn't take the swords down.

We were bros!
These swords represent our bro-hood.

262
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,786
And you took them down to make room
for your fiancée's stupid painting?

263
00:14:03,786 --> 00:14:06,999
My fiancée? Suddenly, she's 'my fiancée'?

Lily's a part of who I am.

265

she's a part of who you are, too.

She's a bro by extension.

who gets the apartment?

In the future, food will most likely
be served in gel-cap form.

died out by then.

(LILY SCREAMING)

335
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:32,467
Oh, God! I'll be right there.

336
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:36,512
Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go.
My friend's been stabbed with a sword.

337
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,644
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

338
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,263
Klingon insult. You have no honor.

339
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:46,741
You know, if you felt this way,
you could have just been up front.

340
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:49,003
No, I swear that was a real call. I just...

341
00:17:50,314 --> 00:17:50,751
Oh, forget it.

342
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:59,674
I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancée.

343
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:04,199
Come on, Marshall.
Do you really think she's still your fiancée?

344
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:06,537
I'm kidding.

345
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,551
Hey, I think you guys
should have the apartment.

346
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,464
But you fought so bravely for it.

347
00:18:14,482 --> 00:18:17,786
I wasn't fighting for the apartment.
I was fighting for...

348
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:21,203
I don't know.
For everything to stay the way it is.

349
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,544
But I'm not gonna get that, so...

350
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,039
Seriously, take the place. It's yours.

351
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,286
Is she okay?

352
00:18:29,206 --> 00:18:30,892
Well, they're just patching her up.
She's gonna be fine.

353
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,756
So, get this.
I was on a date with this girl Jackie.

354
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:38,472
What? You said she's fine. So, anyway,
I was on a date with this girl Jackie.

355
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:41,599
Wow, Jackie.
You make a really great first impression.

356
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:47,058
I have a feeling that tonight
you might end up being Jackie... oh.

357
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:55,134
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to lemon-law you.

358
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,221
It's out there. It's a thing!
The lemon law is a thing!

359
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:00,347
Damn. I should've called it Barney's law.

360
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:04,587
- But, you totally got...
- Just let him have this one.

361
00:19:05,757 --> 00:19:06,209
All set.

362
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,765
She said she'd like to see the knights
of the poorly-constructed round table.

363
00:19:13,124 --> 00:19:13,687
That's us.

364
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,020
A sword fight?

365
00:19:18,787 --> 00:19:19,813
- Sorry, Lily.
- Sorry, Lily.

366
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,543
On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell
my kindergarten class,

367
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:26,068
who I teach not to run with scissors,

368
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:29,992
that my fiancé ran me through
with a fricking broadsword!

369
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:34,514
Well, just to be fair,
it didn't go all the way through.

370
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:39,734
I'm sorry. Is this a discussion of the degree
to which you stabbed me?

371
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,883
You're right. I'm sorry.

372
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:48,132
We were fighting to see
who gets the apartment. And I won.

373
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:51,750
You didn't win. I gave it to you.

374
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,684
- You know what, if I had tried...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait!

375
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,207
I don't want that apartment!
It's a boy apartment.

376
00:19:57,207 --> 00:20:03,030
It's full of swords and video games
and kind of smells like dude.

377
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:08,563
I mean, it's fine for now,
but when we get married,

378
00:20:09,812 --> 00:20:11,247
I wanna start a new life with you.

379
00:20:12,557 --> 00:20:13,216
In a new place.

380
00:20:15,802 --> 00:20:19,348
- Gonna miss the old place.
- I will, too.

381
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,557
We're not getting married for, like, a year.

382
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:24,449
Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem.

383
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:27,144
- Let that guy deal with it.
- Totally.

384
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,421
Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking,
but I'm starving.

385
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,894
- Let's go get some dinner.
- I know just the place.

386
00:20:38,016 --> 00:20:38,843
A Chinese restaurant.

387
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:40,481
- I still don't believe it.
- I told you.

388
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:42,916
Okay, a toast.

389
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:45,816
Life is full of changes.

390
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:49,622
One day you have an apartment,
the next day it's a House of Dumplings.

391
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:54,467
But the important stuff doesn't change.
To the important stuff.

392
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:56,174
- Here, here.
- Cheers.

393
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:56,083
- Well said.
- Cheers.

394
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:58,580
To the lemon law.

395
00:21:01,248 --> 00:21:01,779
Self click.

396
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:06,668
And, by the way, I bought these glasses.
Bought them at Ikea.

397
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:08,456
These are my glasses!

398
00:21:09,672 --> 00:21:11,497
I love this song.
I haven't heard this in forever.

399
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:15,509
I'm pretty sure this is a mix tape
you made me in sophomore year.

400
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:16,619
Yeah, right.

401
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:19,915
Lily, your apartment makes
the best Shanghai dumplings.

402
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:25,522
<i>MARSHALL ON SPEAKER: I love you, Lily.
Happy Valentine's Day, 1998.</i>
