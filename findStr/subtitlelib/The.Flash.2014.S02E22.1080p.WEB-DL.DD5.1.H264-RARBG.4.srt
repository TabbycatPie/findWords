laying waste to central city?

We start with the meta-humans,
they're his armor.

363

We take them down first,
then zoom's more vulnerable.

- Barry,
we don't even know

365
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:56,414
how many of his
minions there are.

366
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,483
- There could be hundreds,
a thousand.

367
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,585
- And all of them, they're all
working with different powers.

368
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,220
- It could take weeks
to track them all down.

369

we don't have weeks.

370

need do to is

371

they didn't work
on earth-2, right?

377
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:18,436
- Yeah, it was a whole
different frequency.

378
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,338

took down the time wraiths,

379
