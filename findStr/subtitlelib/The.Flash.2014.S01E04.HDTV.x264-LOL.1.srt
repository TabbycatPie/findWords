1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,200
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:10,341
When I was a child I saw my
mother killed by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:13,434
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:17,368
Then an accident made me the impossible.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,071
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,903
but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime

7
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:24,839
and find others like me.

8
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:27,276
And one day, I'll find
who killed my mother...

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:27,410
Mom!

10
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:28,873
And get justice for my father.

11
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:32,274
I am the Flash.

12
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:34,147
Previously on The Flash...

13
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,784
What did you say your name was again?

14
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,190
- Barry Allen.
- Felicity.

15
00:00:38,192 --> 00:00:41,466
How's Barry doing?

16
00:00:41,468 --> 00:00:43,199
- It's a secret.
- What kind of secret?

17
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,434
The kind I have to keep.

18
00:00:44,436 --> 00:00:46,371
I just have a little experience

19
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:49,878
with liking someone who doesn't
see the same way.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,812
- Dad, the thing is...
- You two are dating.

21
00:00:51,814 --> 00:00:54,548
- So you're not mad.
- Oh, I'm mad.

22
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,219
What does the fastest man
alive do on his day off?

23
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:03,053
Before the lightning bolt, if I
wasn't still at the crime lab,

24
00:01:03,055 --> 00:01:04,921
I'd be at home chilling,

25
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:06,389
but now my days off are different.

26
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:08,221
Now they aren't so lonely.

27
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:10,859
The lightning didn't just give me speed.

28
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:13,060
It also gave me friends.

29
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:16,095
This isn't even remotely
anatomically correct.

30
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:19,464
That's not the point, Dr. Snow.

31
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,634
Then what is the point?

32
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:23,407
To have fun.

33
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,777
And to continue your ongoing
training by testing the speed

34
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:30,218
of your mind by pushing
your ability to multitask.

35
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:36,657
I'm waiting on you, Dr. Wells.

36
00:01:49,872 --> 00:01:52,941
182 seconds, gentlemen.

37
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:04,115
Heads up! I think we got something.

38
00:02:20,126 --> 00:02:22,760
2-11, 2-11. We're being robbed!

39
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:35,073
Hey, cool it.

40
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:38,477
158 seconds to go.

41
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:43,851
Checkmate.

42
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:45,786
- Wait, checkmate?
- Checkmate.

43
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:47,958
I guess we still have
a few things left to learn,

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,160
don't we, Mr. Allen?

45
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,333
Armed robbery at 4th and Collins.

46
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:57,141
For the record, I crushed it
in operation and ping pong.

47
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,856
It's not as easy as it looks.

48
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:27,338
Ugh!

49
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:32,808
Where's the nearest hospital?

50
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,610
St. Andrews...
Seven blocks north, two east.

51
00:03:34,612 --> 00:03:37,982
Call the ER, tell them
they have an incoming GSW.

52
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,693
Let's go. I want this locked up all the way

53
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,498
to the end of the block.

54
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,998
Tow truck was stolen.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,933
Driver of the armored car
is in a stable condition

56
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,501
at St. Andrews, and no one's
exactly sure how he got there.

57
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,136
Did you check the security cameras?

58
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,705
Camera's storage drive was stolen.

59
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,774
Guys are pros.

60
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:04,810
Everything's still here,

61
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,711
including what I think they were after,

62
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,411
the Kahndaq dynasty diamond.

63
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:11,282
It was on its way to central
city museum for exhibition.

64
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,220
Right, Iris is trying
to talk me into going.

65
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:15,622
I'm not much of a museum guy,

66
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:19,494
but when she really wants to do something...

67
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,067
I'm just going to walk away now.

68
00:04:25,069 --> 00:04:27,004
Sorry, captain. I was at the hospital

69
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,972
- visiting a friend.
- There's nothing missing.

70
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:31,042
It looks like someone
interrupted a robbery.

71
00:04:31,044 --> 00:04:32,643
Guard says there was three of them.

72
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:34,011
Actually, there was four.

73
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:35,444
I mean, that's how many I would bring

74
00:04:35,446 --> 00:04:37,845
if I were doing a robbery of this nature.

75
00:04:37,847 --> 00:04:39,912
That's definitely a four guy truck.

76
00:04:39,914 --> 00:04:42,547
A driver, two more
to cover the guards, and...

77
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,418
Somebody used liquid nitrogen
to crack open this door,

78
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,020
so four bad guys.

79
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:51,259
Thank you, Mr. Allen,
for your brilliant insight.

80
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:52,792
For somebody so fast,

81
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,527
you're a little slow on the improvising.

82
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,360
Did you see anything that could
help us catch these guys?

83
00:04:56,362 --> 00:05:01,764
Yeah, one of them lost his mask.

84
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:06,403
I saw his face.

85
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,070
So look through these mug shots
of Central City's most wanted,

86
00:05:09,072 --> 00:05:10,771
and see if you can find our guy.

87
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:12,373
That's him.

88
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,743
Damn.

89
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,246
Leonard Snart.

90
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,281
Leonard? That's almost
as bad as Bartholomew.

91
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,951
Snart ain't sexy, either.

92
00:05:18,953 --> 00:05:20,886
Snart's father was a cop...

93
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,487
Was a bad cop.

94
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,755
Took his anger out on his kids
until he went to prison.

95
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,758
Snart's dad's in prison too?

96
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,194
We should start a club.

97
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:30,062
He shows up, like, every six months.

98
00:05:30,064 --> 00:05:32,834
He cases a job for weeks
before he makes his move.

99
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:35,037
Then, he does the job... Gets away.

100
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,340
That's before The Streak was around.

101
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:39,610
Did you just refer to yourself
in the third person?

102
00:05:39,612 --> 00:05:41,912
I referred to The Streak,
which I'm pretty sure I can top.

103
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:43,179
I've been thinking of a new name.

104
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,514
What do you think about The Fla...

105
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:46,149
Coffee break.

106
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:47,417
Thought I would bring
Central City's finest java

107
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,019
over to Central City's finest.

108
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:54,161
Thanks. I'm off caffeine.

109
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:55,229
My dad's been mad
at me every since I told him

110
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,165
about me and Eddie.

111
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:58,902
No, you mean he's mad at you
because you didn't tell him.

112
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:01,839
Uh, first, that sounds
like you're taking his side,

113
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:03,374
and second, do you know
how he does this whole,

114
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,076
“I'm not talking to you,
but I have a whole bag

115
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,945
"full of judgmental looks
I'm gonna try out on you later”"

116
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:08,480
yeah, I've been on the receiving end

117
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:09,948
of those a few times.

118
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,582
Speaking of communications,

119
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,884
or lack thereof, after all
of these journalism classes,

120
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:15,585
- I got an idea.
- Huh.

121
00:06:15,587 --> 00:06:17,256
I started a blog.

122
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:19,161
All right, what's it about?
Your brownie obsession?

123
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:20,463
'Cause, you know, you probably
shouldn't broadcast that.

124
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,164
No, something important.

125
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:26,802
Something that Central City
needs to know about, The Streak.

126
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,403
He's out there, Barry.

127
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,603
Rumor has it, he stopped
an armed car robbery earlier.

128
00:06:31,605 --> 00:06:33,505
I was hoping that I could take
a look at the file, and...

129
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:35,106
What? I'm not at liberty

130
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:38,042
to discuss an ongoing police
investigation with you.

131
00:06:38,044 --> 00:06:40,311
Since when, Mr. Blabbermouth?

132
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:41,912
Take it from someone who's been

133
00:06:41,914 --> 00:06:44,180
investigating the impossible
since they were 11.

134
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:45,713
Blogging about this is

135
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:47,415
only gonna bring the crazies
to your front door.

136
00:06:47,417 --> 00:06:49,184
My blog is anonymous.

137
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:51,052
All right, well, anonymous
or not, it's not safe.

138
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:52,987
You never know what kind
of weirdos are out there

139
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:54,255
trolling on the internet.

140
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:55,893
I can vouch for that.

141
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:59,696
The internet is full of
weirdos and nerd rage...

142
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:01,464
Lots and lots of nerd rage.

143
00:07:04,534 --> 00:07:07,070
Hi. Felicity Smoak.

144
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,839
Iris West.

145
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,808
Barry Allen.

146
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,944
But you both already knew that.
Felicity is...

147
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:14,345
The girl that you met in Starling City,

148
00:07:14,347 --> 00:07:16,448
the computerer, right?

149
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,985
You two worked on one
of Barry's unexplainable cases.

150
00:07:18,987 --> 00:07:23,857
Which, long story short,
was definitely explainable.

151
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:27,966
So the lightning came through here?

152
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:31,604
Yeah.

153
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:36,509
There's been some rumors
the last few weeks.

154
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:39,575
People seen a red blur
tearing through the streets.

155
00:07:39,577 --> 00:07:41,209
What the hell is it, man?

156
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,576
Maybe it was a drone.

157
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,880
Some top secret army thing.

158
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:51,017
When I was a kid, my grandfather used to

159
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,656
take my sister and me
to this diner, the motorcar.

160
00:07:54,658 --> 00:07:57,828
Food was for crap, but the view was great,

161
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,166
right across from
the Central City precinct.

162
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:03,634
I still go there. I listen to their radios.

163
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:06,334
I learn their response times.

164
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:08,170
There are 40 banks in Central City,

165
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,974
each of them within 60 seconds
of police response.

166
00:08:10,976 --> 00:08:15,076
That's the advantage
of hitting a moving target.

167
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,978
Once the armored car called 911,

168
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,085
we had 182 seconds before
any cop could be on the scene.

169
00:08:21,087 --> 00:08:25,323
No one could have gotten there
fast enough to stop us.

170
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:29,194
But something did,

171
00:08:29,196 --> 00:08:31,994
and you lost your cool.

172
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:33,895
You know the rules.

173
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:36,798
We don't shoot guards or cops
unless it's the only option.

174
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,833
We don't need the heat.

175
00:08:37,835 --> 00:08:41,869
The heat?

176
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:46,770
What the hell do you think
the blur is, Snart?

177
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:48,972
Right. Screw this.

178
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:51,076
Screw you. I'm out.

179
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,051
Well, if you're out, you're out.

180
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,959
This blur is a man.

181
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,963
We're gonna have to up our game.

182
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,300
Iris seems very nice.

183
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:15,904
And really pretty. Like, super pretty.

184
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:17,738
Congratulations.

185
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,573
Well, Iris isn't my girlfriend.

186
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:23,344
She's just a friend
who actually has a boyfriend.

187
00:09:23,346 --> 00:09:27,216
Oh, that's... Interesting,

188
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:29,819
I guess.

189
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,520
What are you really doing here?

190
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:33,086
I mean, it's good to see you,

191
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:35,122
but do you and Oliver need something, or...

192
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:39,291
No, no, I came because I wanted to see you.

193
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:42,060
I heard you were out of the coma.

194
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:44,329
Didn't call, didn't write,

195
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:47,832
didn't race over...

196
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,469
Oliver told you?

197
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,271
Honestly, I heard you two talking

198
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:59,205
on that rooftop
in Starling City that night.

199
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,278
I want to see it.

200
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,115
And by “it,” I mean your speed,

201
00:10:07,117 --> 00:10:08,350
in case you thought I was
talking about something else,

202
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:12,225
- which I... which I was not.
- Okay.

203
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,094
Okay, you see that building?

204
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:16,129
Uh-huh.

205
00:10:16,131 --> 00:10:18,398
Keep your eyes on it.

206
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:25,442
Whoo-hoo!

207
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:27,114
Whoa.

208
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:29,086
You took a picture of me?

209
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,520
From the top of that building?

210
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:32,889
Yeah. Don't instagram that.

211
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,194
Unbelievable.

212
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:36,829
Your shoes are smoking.

213
00:10:39,664 --> 00:10:42,833
That... that's fine.
It's... it happens sometimes.

214
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:45,266
It's why I have a friction-proof suit.

215
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:47,836
Where did you get that?

216
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,837
I'll show you.

218
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:04,546
And this is where my team monitors the
police bands for criminal activity.

219
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:06,147
We can track anything
that's happening in the city.

220
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,316
Check this out.

221
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,485
We've got our own satellite.

222
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:09,886
I know.

223
00:11:09,888 --> 00:11:11,421
I've hacked into it from time to time.

224
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:13,022
- Rude.
- It is, of course,

225
00:11:13,024 --> 00:11:15,425
so wonderful to see you again, Felicity.

226
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:16,995
I'm just wondering

227
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:20,130
how much of our operation
she needs to know about.

228
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:21,664
I'm really good at keeping secrets.

229
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,134
Yeah, Felicity works with The Arrow.

230
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:26,371
- Sweet.
- And you apparently are not.

231
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:28,205
Now it's all making sense.

232
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:29,639
You know who The Arrow is.

233
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:32,905
Wait, do you know who The Arrow is?

234
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:36,244
Uh...

235
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:38,213
Let's just say that my team
has a similar set up,

236
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,485
but with... More pointy objects.

237
00:11:40,487 --> 00:11:43,388
Welcome, Ms. Smoak.

238
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,823
Dr. Wells?

239
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,292
The Dr. Wells?

240
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:49,529
Please, call me Harrison, Felicity.

241
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,630
Oh, you know who I am?

242
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:52,033
Ranked second in

243
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:53,502
the national informative
technology competition

244
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,770
at age 19,

245
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:56,740
graduated M.I.T. With masters degree

246
00:11:56,742 --> 00:11:58,644
in cyber security and computer sciences.

247
00:11:58,646 --> 00:12:00,347
I know who you are.

248
00:12:00,349 --> 00:12:03,482
I keep an eye out for promising
talent in scientific fields.

249
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,917
It's what brought me Cisco, Caitlin,

250
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,857
and I foresaw great things from you.

251
00:12:11,859 --> 00:12:14,092
Speaking of great things,

252
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:16,028
want to see something cool?

253
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,133
How fast can he run?

254
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:21,769
He hasn't reached his top speed yet,

255
00:12:21,771 --> 00:12:23,970
theoretically speaking.

256
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:25,472
So is he really okay?

257
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:27,639
His heart rate is
within normal range for him.

258
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:31,112
No, I mean, the lightning bolt changed him.

259
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:33,115
Do any of you really know how much?

260
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:35,719
We know a fair amount.

261
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,554
If everything about him is sped up,

262
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:38,855
is he going to age faster?

263
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:40,790
What would happen if he ran too fast?

264
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,359
I mean, would he just
be running, and then, poof,

265
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,466
he's dust in a red costume?

266
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:49,769
Everything we do here at S.T.A.R. Labs

267
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:51,339
is to protect Barry Allen.

268
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:55,178
Trust us, Felicity,
he is in very good hands here.

269
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,681
Want to see how fast I can run backwards?

270
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,920
Don't worry. He heals quickly too.

271
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:08,725
Eh, I don't get it.

272
00:13:08,727 --> 00:13:10,595
Why would snart come here?

273
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:12,096
Snart's been deterred before,

274
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:13,663
but once he goes after something,

275
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:16,030
he doesn't stop until he gets it, ever.

276
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:21,702
Joe, I want you to know that
I'm really serious about Iris.

277
00:13:21,704 --> 00:13:24,907
She's an amazing woman,
and I can really see myself...

278
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,908
I ever tell you about that wild night

279
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,744
I had my last day of college?

280
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:31,411
I don't think so. No?

281
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:34,948
Not even after we kicked back
a few beers after work?

282
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,418
We've never done that.

283
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,852
Oh, right.

284
00:13:38,854 --> 00:13:40,786
That's the things I do with my friends,

285
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:44,156
and since we've never done
those things we ain't friends.

286
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,557
So there's actually no reason

287
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,658
I need to know about your dating life.

288
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,564
I just don't want my personal relationship

289
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:55,503
with your daughter to affect
our working relationship.

290
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:57,538
It ain't about you, Eddie. It's about her.

291
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,843
So as long as we don't talk
about you and her,

292
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:04,580
we will be cool.

293
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,750
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.

294
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:14,057
 When a man loves a woman

295
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:16,862
 let's get it on

296
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,034
Quiet is good.

297
00:14:22,036 --> 00:14:25,876
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

298
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:26,978
Hey, you two.

299
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,747
- Hey.
- We're not a two.

300
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:31,050
Oh, no. We are a one and one.

301
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:32,552
Yeah.

302
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:33,720
Has Barry been showing you

303
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:35,288
some of the sights in Central City?

304
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,193
Yes, I have seen some
pretty amazing things.

305
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:41,662
Really?

306
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:43,664
Well, if you've got some time,

307
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,867
maybe we can show you some
of Central City's night life.

308
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:47,302
Oh, no.

309
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,071
I get plenty of night life
in Starling City.

310
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:51,872
Oh, this is something that

311
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:54,739
I don't think that
you're gonna want to miss.

312
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,337
Trivia night at Jitters.

313
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,240
Eddie's not really excited
about it, I admit.

314
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:00,143
But it could be our night, guys.

315
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:02,912
Our night to win $75 worth of cappuccinos.

316
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:05,484
Uh, yum.

317
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:06,954
You know what, I'm gonna go call work,

318
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,856
check in, make sure everything's okay.

319
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:12,860
I'll be back in a second.

320
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,729
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

321
00:15:14,731 --> 00:15:16,130
The trivia night with you and Eddie,

322
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,069
forcing this whole double date thing.

323
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:20,272
Because that girl is great,

324
00:15:20,274 --> 00:15:23,043
and she happens to come
from your very rare species

325
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:25,445
of adorable nerds.

326
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,717
Why didn't you tell me more about her?

327
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,219
There's nothing to tell.

328
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,722
She's just a friend.

329
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:32,894
Barry, girls don't just hop on trains

330
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,230
and travel hundreds of miles

331
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:36,397
to see someone that they don't like.

332
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,730
See, this is why you need my help.

333
00:15:38,732 --> 00:15:39,965
Bring her tonight.

334
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:42,733
We'll have fun.

335
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,471
Yeah, fun.

336
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,443
You wanted state of the art, Snart.

337
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:53,545
I bring you state of the art, my good sir.

338
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:56,047
- What's this?
- It might not look like much,

339
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,547
but never judge a book
by its cover, you know?

340
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:01,585
Fires highly concentrated,
combustible liquid fuel

341
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,722
that ignites on contact with the air.

342
00:16:03,724 --> 00:16:05,757
I don't need to heat things up.

343
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,996
I need to slow them down.

344
00:16:09,998 --> 00:16:11,163
That's the one, then.

345
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:12,965
You were drawn right to it.

346
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:16,437
Stolen from S.T.A.R. Labs
after the incident,

347
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,339
and with nothing
but a skeleton security crew

348
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:20,673
to guard the tech inside.

349
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:23,812
Emits some sort of substance.
I'm not sure what it is.

350
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:27,184
Like a white flame,
but it's not hot, it's cold.

351
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,718
Glasses look like they're made
of the same tech.

352
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,288
What are they for?

353
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,390
The glare. You'll see.

354
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,726
Who else knows you took this?

355
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,731
Just us.

356
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:41,035
No, just me.

357
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:43,036
Sorry, pal.

358
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,670
Party people, who's ready
to get their trivia on?

359
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:59,272
Okay, everybody, welcome.
We've got some new challengers.

360
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:04,278
Please, welcome e=mc Hammer.

361
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,347
No, you see, I did it because E=mc squared

362
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:10,185
is Einstein's formula
for kinetic energy, right?

363
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,455
And, you know, can't touch this.

364
00:17:12,457 --> 00:17:14,392
That's great, Barry.

365
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:16,462
So where is Felicity?

366
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:17,831
I'm not sure.

367
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:20,002
I told her it started at...

368
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:25,509
Feel free to buy yourself that dress.

369
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,348
I totally overdressed for trivia night.

370
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,184
No, you look amazing.

371
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:35,156
Yeah, you do.

372
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:37,625
E=mc hammer.

373
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,326
That's funny.

374
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:42,763
See?

375
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:44,998
It wasn't until 1852,

376
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,635
when the transcontinental
railroad laid their tracks

377
00:17:47,637 --> 00:17:49,373
through this thriving cattle town,

378
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,775
that we became officially incorporated.

379
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:55,315
That same year, the worst flood
this area's ever seen hit.

380
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:59,455
But from that disaster rose
Central City's greatest hero,

381
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:03,093
cattle rancher Bobby “Bovine” Mcfeely.

382
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:07,198
Bovine Mcfeely saved 17 cows
from the great flood.

383
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,470
Hey, kid. Gum?

384
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,645
And now, for the exhibit

385
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:22,849
I'm sure you've all come here to see,

386
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,851
the historic Kahndaq dynasty diamond.

387
00:18:26,853 --> 00:18:28,455
Be careful. Get too close

388
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:30,925
and you'll set off the proximity alarms.

389
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:33,227
Wouldn't want to do that.

390
00:18:45,438 --> 00:18:47,106
- Three is Pasteur.
- Mm-mm.

391
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:49,375
Three is Erdel, and four is Pasteur.

392
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,778
- Right.
- Five?

393
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,812
- Descartes.
- Descartes.

394
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:54,844
Are they even speaking English?

395
00:18:54,846 --> 00:19:00,617
And the points go to E=mc Hammer.

396
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,752
I knew you two would make a good team.

397
00:19:03,754 --> 00:19:05,620
So, Felicity, what do you do?

398
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:06,922
I work in computer sciences

399
00:19:06,924 --> 00:19:09,222
- at Queen Consolidated.
- Really?

400
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:12,726
Do you have a boyfriend in Starling City?

401
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:16,497
No, no, there is no one.

402
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:17,830
I'll get us some more drinks.

403
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,430
And I had too many of those first ones,

404
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:21,600
so I will be right back.

405
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:31,477
- What?
- Dude.

406
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,412
Dude? Wha...

407
00:19:33,414 --> 00:19:35,848
Are you still gonna tell me
that she's not into you?

408
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,885
Look at that dress.

409
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:39,454
And when I asked her
the boyfriend question,

410
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:40,957
she froze.

411
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,359
Yeah, you were
particularly sly with that one.

412
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:46,894
Felicity is smart, nice, and pretty.

413
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,097
And most importantly, she is the first girl

414
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:51,701
at I have seen you with
that really understands

415
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:53,736
and appreciates you for the amazing person

416
00:19:53,738 --> 00:19:56,505
that I am always telling you that you are.

417
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:59,074
She's perfect for you,

418
00:19:59,076 --> 00:20:02,344
so what are you waiting for, Barry?

419
00:20:04,648 --> 00:20:06,916
How long has it been missing?

420
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:10,621
I don't know.

421
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,623
I'm gonna ask you again, Cisco.

422
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,389
But when I do,

423
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:18,395
I expect a more specific answer
than “I don't know.”

424
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:23,870
now, how long has this weapon been gone?

425
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,509
A day, maybe two.

426
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:29,445
One of the janitors didn't
show up for work this morning.

427
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:31,415
He was probably the one who took it.

428
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:35,054
I didn't think that...

429
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,655
You didn't think,

430
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:40,027
because if you had, you would
have discussed with me

431
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,429
first your desire to build
something that could,

432
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,531
in theory, hurt anyone,

433
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,166
and in particular, Barry Allen.

434
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:47,834
I'm sorry.

435
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,835
If you just let me explain...

436
00:20:49,837 --> 00:20:51,638
You know how I feel about weapons, cisco.

437
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,374
They do not belong in S.T.A.R. Labs.

438
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:57,647
Now, you are gonna figure out
a way to locate this gun,

439
00:20:57,649 --> 00:21:01,083
and you are gonna do it right now.

440
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,328
This thing you built, what can it do?

441
00:21:13,365 --> 00:21:15,666
Bad stuff.

442
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:18,402
You said to call if there
was anything suspicious.

443
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:20,404
This guy went through the tour twice.

444
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,673
Nobody does that.

445
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:31,246
This is Detective West.

446
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,914
I have a visual on
Leonard Snart at the museum.

447
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,182
Requesting immediate back up.

448
00:21:38,254 --> 00:21:40,019
I'm sorry. I thought I knew it,

449
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:42,554
and I got excited, and I... I just hit it.

450
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:45,456
No, I mean, maybe they'll get it wrong too.

451
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,389
Oh, yeah. I am sure that the team

452
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:49,426
named Pride and Padawans
doesn't know the name

453
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:54,362
to Han Solo's ship.

454
00:21:54,364 --> 00:21:58,102
Oh, honey, you are so cute
when you're confused.

455
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:06,378
Someone spotted snart.

456
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,224
- I gotta go.
- I'll cover for you.

457
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:13,125
All right, what are you gonna say?

458
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:14,527
I usually tell people Oliver's
at a night club with a girl

459
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:15,729
or nursing a hangover.

460
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:17,098
None of which will work for me.

461
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,732
Bad stomach ache... Really bad diarrhea.

462
00:22:18,734 --> 00:22:19,966
Yeah, I'm not comfortable with that excuse.

463
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:21,100
Just go.

464
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:22,869
Stay safe.

465
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:25,874
And I'm talking to air now, which is odd.

466
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,977
And I'm still doing it.

467
00:22:44,193 --> 00:22:45,961
Snart!

468
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:20,898
- You okay?
- Ahh, aah, it burns.

469
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:31,013
Time for a test run.

470
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:33,949
Let's see how fast you are.

471
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:39,922
Gah!

472
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,976
No!

473
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:09,592
No.

474
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,816
It's still numb.

475
00:24:22,818 --> 00:24:24,686
It's presenting itself
like third degree frostbite.

476
00:24:24,688 --> 00:24:26,190
I thought he had hyper healing.

477
00:24:26,192 --> 00:24:27,728
It's been slowed.

478
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,296
If your cells weren't
regenerating at the rate

479
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,798
they are, your blood vessels
would have frozen solid

480
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,769
and the nerve damage
would have been permanent.

481
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:35,105
You're lucky to be alive.

482
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,240
Snart wasn't another meta-human.

483
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,474
He has some kind of gun.

484
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,909
It froze things, slowed me down...

485
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:44,279
Enough that I wasn't in time
to save someone.

486
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:45,815
According to his record,

487
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,449
Snart didn't even bother
to finish high school,

488
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:51,152
so how did he build a handheld
high tech snow machine?

489
00:24:51,154 --> 00:24:53,354
S.T.A.R. Labs built the cold gun.

490
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:58,157
Dr. Wells and Caitlin
had nothing to do with this.

491
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,160
I built the gun.

492
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:04,497
You did?

493
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:05,732
Why?

494
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:08,870
Because speed and cold are opposites.

495
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:10,437
Temperature is measured

496
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,572
by how quickly the atoms
of something are oscillating.

497
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:14,441
The faster they are, the hotter it is,

498
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:17,143
and when then are cold, they're
slower on the atomic level.

499
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:19,448
When there's no movement at all,
it's called...

500
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,951
Absolute zero.

501
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,617
Yeah.

502
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:29,293
I designed a compact cryo engine
to achieve absolute zero.

503
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,527
I built it to stop you.

504
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,665
I didn't know who you were then, Barry.

505
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,434
I mean, what if you turned out
to be some psycho,

506
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,668
like Mardon or Nimbus?

507
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,237
But I didn't. Did I?

508
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:45,241
We built the entire structure
you're standing in to do good,

509
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,708
and it blew up.

510
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,944
In the wake of that,
you can understand why Cisco

511
00:25:48,946 --> 00:25:50,746
would want to be prepared for the worst.

512
00:25:50,748 --> 00:25:53,050
I can understand that,
but what I can't understand

513
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,920
is why you didn't tell me what you did.

514
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,455
I mean, after all we've been through,

515
00:25:57,457 --> 00:25:58,822
I thought you trusted me.

516
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,856
- I thought we were friends.
- We are, Barry.

517
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,693
I mean, if you would have just told me,

518
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:04,562
I could have been prepared.

519
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,764
But instead, someone died tonight.

520
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:11,705
And I have to live with that.

521
00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:15,911
No, Cisco. We all do.

522
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,553
Theatergoers remain shaken

523
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:24,754
after surviving tonight's
brutal and bizarre attack

524
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:25,721
in a downtown theater...

525
00:26:25,723 --> 00:26:28,791
The news... Are you okay?

526
00:26:28,793 --> 00:26:31,627
I'm fine.

527
00:26:31,629 --> 00:26:33,797
How long is this gonna go on?

528
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,468
Seems like the cold treatment
is going around.

529
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,903
Not now, Iris, please.

530
00:26:37,905 --> 00:26:40,037
Yes, now.

531
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,840
You did the same thing
when I tried to sign up

532
00:26:41,842 --> 00:26:43,776
for the police academy without telling you.

533
00:26:43,778 --> 00:26:45,578
You didn't speak to me for weeks...

534
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,548
Not until I withdrew my application.

535
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,087
Well, I am not withdrawing this time, dad.

536
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:52,524
I am dating Eddie
whether you like it or not.

537
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,326
- Eddie's my partner.
- I know.

538
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:55,895
But you don't. You're not a cop.

539
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:58,396
You don't know what having a partner means.

540
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:01,334
Wherever I go, he goes,

541
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:04,605
and where I go isn't always safe, Iris.

542
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:08,243
I need to be 100% focused.

543
00:27:08,245 --> 00:27:11,651
Now, there's a part
of me that isn't focused,

544
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,619
that doesn't see Eddie as my partner,

545
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:15,887
but as your boyfriend.

546
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:19,389
So if he gets hurt or worse,

547
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:21,392
and I'm there,

548
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:23,496
how am I gonna look at you?

549
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:26,566
How you gonna look at me?

550
00:27:26,568 --> 00:27:29,269
Now, I'm not mad at you,

551
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:34,174
but that's why this is so hard for me.

552
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:36,209
Do you understand?

553
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:41,548
We're going back tonight.

554
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,982
- Back where?
- To the museum.

555
00:27:42,984 --> 00:27:45,019
That diamond isn't going to steal itself.

556
00:27:45,021 --> 00:27:47,124
Super gun freeze your brain, Snart?

557
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:48,992
The museum's gonna
be crawling with police by now,

558
00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:50,826
- and The Streak.
- This can stop The Streak.

559
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:53,498
It hurt him, and I know his real weakness.

560
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,500
So we go, unless you want out.

561
00:27:56,502 --> 00:28:00,038
We both want out... Alive.

562
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,905
So you thought ahead and made a plan.

563
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:06,578
Least I taught you something.

564
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,348
So what are you waiting for?

565
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,318
Shoot me.

566
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,554
You better put a bullet
in my brain right now,

567
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:15,356
because if you don't,

568
00:28:15,358 --> 00:28:17,957
if I ever see either one of you again...

569
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,256
You don't get it, do you?

570
00:28:20,258 --> 00:28:22,592
This blur is out there,

571
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:25,725
and Central City ain't
your playground anymore.

572
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:33,161
Sure, it is.

573
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:42,533
Barry?

574
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:45,834
Barry.

575
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:48,806
What? What are you doing?

576
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:51,074
You should go back to your hotel.

577
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:53,612
- Get some sleep.
- You should too.

578
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:56,848
Not go back to my hotel...
I meant get some sleep.

579
00:29:00,755 --> 00:29:02,487
I can't.

580
00:29:02,489 --> 00:29:04,955
Every time I close my eyes,
I see that man's face.

581
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,697
I watched him die.

582
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:15,969
I have to go faster.

583
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,839
Barry, it's not your fault.

584
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:20,407
And it's not Cisco's, either.

585
00:29:20,409 --> 00:29:21,943
Barry, I know you're upset,

586
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:25,382
but you have to look at this
from his point of view.

587
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:27,318
No, I get it.

588
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,019
He didn't trust me.

589
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:32,091
Barry, when you met us...
Me, Oliver, and Dig...

590
00:29:32,093 --> 00:29:35,130
We were this well-oiled archery machine.

591
00:29:35,132 --> 00:29:37,401
But it didn't start out that way.

592
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:39,639
And unlike you guys, we weren't
tossed together overnight.

593
00:29:39,641 --> 00:29:42,710
We came together one at a time.

594
00:29:42,712 --> 00:29:44,481
Believe me, it took much more
than watching Oliver

595
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,219
do the salmon ladder to make me trust him.

596
00:29:59,268 --> 00:30:04,869
I've seen firsthand
what this life can do to people.

597
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,840
It's a lonely path.

598
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:10,673
Don't make it any
lonelier than it has to be.

599
00:30:23,508 --> 00:30:25,543
Freeze!

600
00:30:25,545 --> 00:30:27,712
You want to end up like that door?

601
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:38,057
Hi there.

602
00:30:39,862 --> 00:30:42,032
I figured out a way to track Captain Cold.

603
00:30:42,034 --> 00:30:43,901
You gotta stop naming these guys.

604
00:30:43,903 --> 00:30:47,404
- Barry, listen to him.
- How?

605
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:50,509
The cold gun is powered
by an engine control unit,

606
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:52,949
a microcomputer that regulates
air-to-fuel ratios

607
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,250
so the sub-cooled fluid

608
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:56,287
in the chambers don't overflow and...

609
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:58,021
- Explode.
- Right.

610
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:01,390
This E.C.U. was receiving updates
wirelessly from my tablet.

611
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:04,260
If I boost the signal
using Central City's network

612
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,527
and send a false update,

613
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:06,960
we'll get a ping back, and then...

614
00:31:06,962 --> 00:31:09,528
We can locate Snart.

615
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,029
How long will it take?

616
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:12,698
First I have to hack
into the City's network,

617
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,667
so I don't know, 30 minutes, maybe?

618
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,368
I can do it in less than one.

619
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,369
When it comes to hacking,
I'm the fastest woman alive.

620
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:22,141
Ow! That was not as badass as I pictured.

621
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:25,781
All right, I'm in.

622
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,115
Are you kidding?

623
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,884
All right, I'm sending the updates.

624
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:31,218
We're connected.

625
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,284
Network is triangulating the location.

626
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:35,520
We got him. He's heading west on Nelson

627
00:31:35,522 --> 00:31:37,286
toward the train station.

628
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,822
If he's leaving, it appears
Mr. Snart may have gotten

629
00:31:39,824 --> 00:31:42,760
what he came for.

630
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:44,529
When we put our minds to it,

631
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:46,964
dude, nothing can stop us.

632
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:48,967
Oh, you turned your ear piece off.

633
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:51,138
How are we gonna talk to each other?

634
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,675
I don't feel like talking right now.

635
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:03,389
All available units, suspect
spotted at Central City train station.

636
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:05,695
We got Snart.

637
00:32:05,697 --> 00:32:08,466
- Wait here for back up.
- Wait for back up? No way.

638
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,235
That's an order.

639
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:15,541
- You should go after Barry.
- You heard him, Felicity.

640
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:16,976
He wants to do this alone.

641
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,377
Of course, he said that.

642
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:19,612
He's hurt.

643
00:32:19,614 --> 00:32:21,347
You're his team and his friends.

644
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:23,649
If I had a nickel for every time
The Arrow told me to back off,

645
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,616
I would be as rich as Oliver Queen,

646
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:28,552
who I mention because he's
the richest person I know,

647
00:32:28,554 --> 00:32:30,054
or used to be.

648
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:32,593
The point is,

649
00:32:32,595 --> 00:32:35,127
you have your partner's back

650
00:32:35,129 --> 00:32:39,033
no matter what.

651
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:42,536
I have something that might help.

652
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,450
I'm your partner, not your assistant.

653
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,901
There's nowhere to run.

654
00:33:14,903 --> 00:33:16,569
I didn't see you before.

655
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:19,875
Your mom know you're out past your bedtime?

656
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:22,079
If you wanted to get away
you should've taken something

657
00:33:22,081 --> 00:33:23,682
faster than a train.

658
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:26,449
That's if I wanted to get away.

659
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:29,385
I've seen your weakness at the armored car,

660
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:31,021
then at the theater.

661
00:33:31,023 --> 00:33:33,723
See, while you're busy saving everybody,

662
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:36,327
I'll be saving myself.

663
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:52,382
Good luck with that.

664
00:34:31,062 --> 00:34:32,496
Ahh!

665
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:35,632
Pretty fast, kid,

666
00:34:35,634 --> 00:34:38,236
but not fast enough.

667
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:46,798
Thank you.

668
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,966
For what?

669
00:34:47,968 --> 00:34:50,170
You forced me to up my game,

670
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:51,372
not only with this gun,

671
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:53,973
but with how I think about the job.

672
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,574
It's been educational.

673
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:59,309
Drop it.

674
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:01,010
This is a prototype cold gun,

675
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:05,747
four times the size, four times the power.

676
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:07,852
I was wondering who you were talking to.

677
00:35:07,854 --> 00:35:10,956
Hey, unless you want a taste
of your own medicine,

678
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:11,958
I'd back the hell up.

679
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,193
Your hands are shaking.

680
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,896
You've never killed anyone.

681
00:35:14,898 --> 00:35:17,865
There's a first time
for everything, Captain Cold.

682
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:21,804
I will shoot you.

683
00:35:25,871 --> 00:35:29,205
You win, kid.

684
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:31,506
I'll see you around.

685
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,213
Hey, leave the diamond.

686
00:35:38,215 --> 00:35:40,483
Don't push your luck.

687
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,825
Couldn't shoot him if I wanted to.

688
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:52,664
This is actually
the S.T.A.R. Labs vacuum cleaner

689
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,397
with a lot of L.E.D's.

690
00:35:54,399 --> 00:35:58,732
Let's get you warm.

691
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:00,766
Thank you.

692
00:36:11,581 --> 00:36:13,081
We've been trying to track Snart,

693
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:17,855
but he must have
disconnected the signal somehow.

694
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:22,793
We'll find him, Cisco, together.

695
00:36:24,597 --> 00:36:27,369
You have a great team here, Barry.

696
00:36:27,371 --> 00:36:32,875
Speaking of teams, I should
probably get back to mine.

697
00:36:32,877 --> 00:36:35,647
It was nice meeting you, Ms. Smoak.

698
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:38,284
Please extend a hello to The Arrow for us.

699
00:36:38,286 --> 00:36:40,555
I will.

700
00:36:43,594 --> 00:36:46,230
Good-bye, Felicity.

701
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:49,266
Bye, Barry.

702
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,239
Remarkable young woman.

703
00:37:03,241 --> 00:37:05,906
She's special.

704
00:37:05,908 --> 00:37:08,409
Yeah, she is.

705
00:37:13,784 --> 00:37:16,888
Cisco,

706
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:22,132
don't you ever do anything like that again.

707
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:25,972
Do you understand me?

708
00:37:25,974 --> 00:37:28,543
Yes, sir.

709
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:44,062
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

710
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:50,702
If you're looking for Eddie,
he's in evidence.

711
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:53,303
I am looking for you.

712
00:37:53,305 --> 00:37:55,439
I came to apologize... Again.

713
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,744
You're really trying to hit
that magic number, aren't you?

714
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,313
Look, dad, I just want you to know

715
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,616
that there is nothing that you could do

716
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,684
that would ever change the way
that I look at you.

717
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,318
And I'm sorry.

718
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,853
I should have thought about how

719
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,322
it would affect you if Eddie and I...

720
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:14,327
Listen...

721
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:17,365
Chasing down this Snart character tonight?

722
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,668
He had the draw on me.

723
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,473
Eddie saved my life.

724
00:38:23,475 --> 00:38:26,275
Maybe I underestimated him.

725
00:38:26,277 --> 00:38:30,109
From now on, no more secrets.

726
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,616
No more secrets.

727
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,914
- Well, go see Eddie.
- Okay.

728
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:47,015
Thank him for watching out
for your old man.

729
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:07,673
Did I just yelp?

730
00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:09,210
- Yeah.
- I yelped.

731
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:10,913
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

732
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,681
Don't tell me you're here to save me.

733
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,816
Taking the train is still one
of the safest ways to travel.

734
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:16,952
I thought that was airplanes.

735
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,121
Mm...

736
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:25,196
You remember when you told me
you had a little experience

737
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:27,666
liking somebody who
didn't see you the same way?

738
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:31,636
That was Iris, right?

739
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:35,974
How did you know?

740
00:39:35,976 --> 00:39:38,342
It's the little things.

741
00:39:38,344 --> 00:39:41,513
The way you linger on her
when she isn't looking,

742
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:45,215
the smile you fake to play the part,

743
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:48,084
quiet dreams you keep to yourself.

744
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:54,490
Like you and Oliver.

745
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,462
Takes one to know one.

746
00:40:01,034 --> 00:40:04,771
I'm afraid it'll change everything.

747
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:07,505
It will,

748
00:40:07,507 --> 00:40:10,175
but maybe that's not such a bad thing.

749
00:40:13,516 --> 00:40:14,783
What is wrong with us?

750
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:18,084
We are perfectly perfect for each other.

751
00:40:18,086 --> 00:40:22,122
Yet we're sitting here,
pining for people we can't have.

752
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:24,956
I guess what they say is true.

753
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:26,992
Opposites do attract.

754
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:33,030
If you ever need anything,
I will race over in a heartbeat.

755
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:34,532
Same.

756
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:36,067
Well, as fast I can run,

757
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:38,901
which might take me a while,
but I will still come.

758
00:40:46,073 --> 00:40:48,644
Bye, Felicity.

759
00:41:08,463 --> 00:41:10,832
Bye, Barry.

760
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,735
Whoo-hoo!

761
00:41:19,374 --> 00:41:22,676
I know it's been a while
since we pulled that job.

762
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:25,410
I know it didn't go so well for you,

763
00:41:25,412 --> 00:41:27,146
and I know I said we were finished.

764
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:28,748
But things have changed.

765
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,549
If I want to keep working in Central City,

766
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:33,254
I'm gonna need a new kind of crew.

767
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:35,388
I'm gonna need someone like you.

768
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,424
You're tolerant of extremes.

769
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:40,025
You have certain skills.

770
00:41:40,027 --> 00:41:44,366
You just need some direction.

771
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:47,567
And I can give that to you.

772
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:50,173
You still like playing with fire?

773
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:53,008
You're gonna love this.

774
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,042
So...

775
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,710
Are you in Mick? Or are you out?

776
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,812
Yeah buddy, I'm in.
