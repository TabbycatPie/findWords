1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:05,960
杰
Jay?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,330
你看到葡萄了没
Have you seen the grapes?

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,590
-我吃完了  -你为什么把葡萄吃了
- Yeah, I ate them. - Why would you eat the grapes?

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,150
因为它们放在碗里  洗过了
They were in a bowl, they were washed,

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,110
而且是我花钱买的
I paid for them.

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,560
那是为新年准备的
They were for the new year's.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,930
对了  要用它们做什么蠢事来着
Oh, right. What's that goofy thing again?

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,650
才不蠢呢  那是一种传统
It's not goofy. It's a tradition.

9
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,830
你在午夜时分吃下12颗葡萄
At midnight, you eat 12 grapes,

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,840
许下12个心愿  新年的每个月一个
you make 12 wishes, 1 for each month of the year.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,360
你还真相信吗
And you really think that works?

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,190
五年前
Five years ago,

13
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,270
我是一名住在贫民窟里的单亲妈妈
I was a single mother living in a slum.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,730
如今  我就要开着新车
Today, I'm driving to Palm Springs

15
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,370
和我的大款老公一起去棕榈泉了
in my new car with my rich husband.

16
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,050
随你怎么样  反正我要吃葡萄
You do what you want. I'm eating the grapes.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,100
除夕之夜  我们会带着菲尔和克莱尔
For new year's eve, we're taking Phil and Claire

18
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,990
以及米奇尔和小卡去棕榈泉一家
and Mitch and Cam to this amazing hotel

19
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,710
我曾住过的一家超棒的酒店玩
I used to go to in Palm Springs.

20
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,150
他们那儿提供全套的服务
They got a whole package--

21
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,330
晚餐  舞蹈和午夜祝酒
Dinner, dancing, toast at midnight.

22
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,800
我想问  夫复何求啊
I mean, what more do you need?

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,910
-葡萄  -我说过我们会在路上停一下的
- Grapes. - I said we'd stop on the way.

24
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,420
海莉  今天是除夕夜
Haley, it's new year's eve.

25
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,350
你确定你不想参加个派对什么的
Are you sure you don't wanna go to a party or something?

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,640
然后听我所有的朋友唠叨
And listen to all my friends talk about

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,220
大学生活有多赞吗
how awesome college is?

28
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,300
我知道大学生活有多赞
I know how awesome college is.

29
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,710
那正是我被踢出来的原因
That's what got me kicked out.

30
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,850
我相信米奇尔舅舅
Well, I'm sure uncle Mitchell

31
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,350
要是知道有你在家坐镇的话
will feel much better leaving Lily here

32
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,050
一定会更乐意把莉莉留在我们家的
knowing that you're in charge.

33
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,470
你知道其实是你管事  对吧
You know you're really in charge, right?

34
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,340
你们怎么就知道我不用参加派对呢
How do you know I don't have a party?

35
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,930
好吧  当我没问
Okay, fine.

36
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,520
莉莉  你准备好和表哥表姐们一起住了吗
Lily, are you ready for your big sleepover with your cousins?

37
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,390
谁照看我啊
Who's watching me?

38
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,710
-海莉  -我说真的
- Haley. - I'm serious.

39
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,530
艾丽克斯
Alex.

40
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,460
好的  我们走吧
Okay, let's go.

41
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,680
每年的除夕夜  都是
Every new year's eve, it's like,

42
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,870
"我们干点啥  我们干点啥"
"What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?"

43
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,320
所以我们对杰策划的活动很满意
So we were happy that Jay planned this whole thing.

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,010
那真的是  免去了我们为了
It really, you know, takes the pressure off

45
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,150
超越自己而承受的压力
of having to outdo ourselves.

46
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,840
是啊  叫我们如何胜过去年呢
Yeah, and how are we gonna possibly top last year?

47
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,720
我们睡过头了吗
Oh. Did we miss it?

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,120
才十点钟
It's only 10:00.

49
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,490
-什么  -才十点钟
- What? - It's only 10:00.

50
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,760
-什么  -才十点钟
- What? - It's only 10:00.

51
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,430
这地方比我印象里小了点
Place is smaller than I remember.

52
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,940
你就觉得小而已吗
Smaller's your issue?

53
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,320
杰  你上次来这里是什么时候
When was the last time that you were here, Jay?

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,930
没多久  74年75年左右
Not that long ago. 1974, '75.

55
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,140
是我两岁的时候吗
So when I was 2?

56
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,450
你这么说我就不乐意了
I don't like when you do that.

57
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,850
我看过他们的网站  照片看起来挺漂亮的
I checked the web site. The pictures looked beautiful.

58
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,430
妈呀  蜥蜴
Oh! Lizard. Huh?

59
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,610
永远别相信网上的照片
Never trust pictures on the internet.

60
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,500
只要找好拍照的角度
Shoot it from the right angle,

61
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,960
你可以让所有东西显得更大更好
You can make anything look bigger and better.

62
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,010
他说的是房子  死变态  他是房产经纪人
Houses, you pervs. He's a realtor.

63
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,500
我就觉得听到动静了
I thought I heard voices.

64
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,920
罗比  我跟你说嘛  来人了
Robby! I told you! It's people.

65
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,900
我的天呐  那就是20年后的我啊
Oh, my god. That's me in 20 years!

66
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,770
好吧  你要是她  我就是抛弃她的人
Okay, you be her, and I'll be whoever left her.

67
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,380
我们办入住  预订名字是普里契特
Uh, we're checking in. It's under Pritchett.

68
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,810
杰·普里契特  三间房
Jay pritchett. Three rooms.

69
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,670
你以前在我们这里住过
You've been with us before.

70
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,820
那个本子用了多少年了
How old is that book?

71
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,890
这里有些什么东西黏黏糊糊的
Oh, there is something sticky over here.

72
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,050
罗比
Robby!

73
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,180
那东西回来了
It came back.

74
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,940
不可能啊
It's not possible.

75
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,940
好吧  这个地方确实大不如前了
Okay, so the place is not what it used to be.

76
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,630
不过我们还是会玩得开心的
But we're gonna have fun.

77
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,260
在星光照耀的房间里用餐
Dining in the starlight room,

78
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,350
在谢莉·斯特罗曼三重奏下翩翩起舞
little dancing with the Shelley Stroman trio.

79
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,400
三人组只剩两人了  给你钥匙
Oh, there's just two left. Here are your keys.

80
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,020
退房时间是11点  要是你想待久一点
Check out's at 11:00, but if you wanna stay longer--

81
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,990
11点没问题 
11:00 is good. 

82
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,230
就是这里了
Here we go.

83
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,680
有什么问题吗
Is there anything wrong?

84
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,230
没有没有  我们只是希望
No, no. No, we were just hoping for something

85
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,880
-更有浪漫气氛  -拜托
- a little more romantic. - Come on, now.

86
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,330
没有那么糟糕
It's not that bad.

87
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,230
-那里面有什么  -没什么
- What's in there? - Nothing.

88
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,620
要是你想找浪漫的地方
If you're looking for romance,

89
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,550
附近有一处很隐蔽的温泉
there's a secluded hot spring nearby.

90
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,820
-就像一块璞玉  -是吗
- Kind of a hidden gem. - Huh?

91
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,080
只要顺着高尔夫球场
Just follow the path

92
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,330
12号洞右边的小路走就能找到
right by the 12th hole of the golf course.

93
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,290
听起来很不错啊
That sounds kinda nice.

94
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,070
隐蔽的  天然的
Secluded. Natural.

95
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,990
-性感的  -性感的
- Sexy. - Sexy.

96
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,010
你觉得怎么样  菲尔
What do you think, phil?

97
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,060
温泉有没有鸡蛋味儿啊
Does it smell like eggs?

98
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,420
有些温泉跟鸡蛋一个味儿
Some of them smell like eggs.

99
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,560
我和菲尔已经好久没有...
It's been a while since Phil and I...

100
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,340
十二月份整个月
The whole month of December?

101
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,060
都没有一次...
Not even a...

102
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,160
或者是打快...你懂的
Or a quick... you know?

103
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,310
说起来挺难为情  那不是我们的作风
It's embarrassing, and it's not like us.

104
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,280
让我觉得很紧张
That's making me anxious,

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,720
所以我才会真的需要...
Which is why I really need to get...

106
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,150
再次感谢
Thanks again.

107
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,030
对  那是给你的
Yeah, that's yours to keep.

108
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,550
好了
Okay.

109
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,860
再见了
Bye now.

110
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,530
我建议我们不和我爸吃晚餐了
I say we bag dinner with my dad,

111
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,820
去找那个温泉吧
and go find that hot spring.

112
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,460
亲爱的  我们不能丢下你爸
Honey, we can't just ditch your father.

113
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,770
他希望我们全家人一起
He wanted us all to be together.

114
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,130
我们一直在一起
We are always together.

115
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,370
我的天  难道我们还指望
Oh, my god, what are we gonna hear

116
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,280
听到什么新鲜事吗
that we've never heard before?

117
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,220
米奇尔和小卡那个关于莉莉如何用
Mitch and Cam's inspiring story

118
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,360
海姆立克急救法救下小孩的动人故事吗
of how lily saved that kid with the Heimlich?

119
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,760
拜托  不就是她抱他一下
Please. She hugged him,

120
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
他就把口香糖吐出来了嘛
and he spit his gum out.

121
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,320
不如我们拿上一瓶香槟
I say we get a bottle of champagne,

122
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,890
仰望着星空
Look up at the stars,

123
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,660
不穿游泳衣
forget our bathing suits.

124
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,730
听起来确实诱人
That does sound hot.

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,590
不过到时我只会一心想着你爸的
But I'd just be thinking about your dad the whole time.

126
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,430
我去冲个澡
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

127
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,850
里面有什么
What's in there?

128
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,210
没什么
Nothing.

129
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,270
太好了  不  是好极了  
Oh, perfect. No, great.

130
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,980
要是我们需要袜子的话
If we need any socks,

131
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,830
床上正好有人留了一只
someone left one in the bed.

132
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,890
我的神呐  克里斯宾去灯塔
Oh, my gosh. There is no way Crispin stays here

133
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,420
是绝不会住在这里的
when he comes to the Beacon.

134
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,470
什么灯塔
What's the beacon?

135
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,130
就是他经常大加赞赏的那个俱乐部啊
The club that he's always raving about.

136
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,690
就在那条街边上
It's right down the street.

137
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,220
那才是我们该去的地方
That's where we should go.

138
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,400
迎新年找乐子的地方
Somewhere fun for new year's,

139
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,470
趁着我们还算年...轻吧
while we're still young... ish.

140
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,240
我们翘掉晚饭去那里吧
L-let's get out of dinner and go there.

141
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,500
-怎么翘  -我不知道
- How? - I don't know.

142
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,210
有了  有了
Um... okay, okay.

143
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,840
你可以在餐桌上假装病了
Um, y-you could pretend to get sick at the table.

144
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,530
假装咳嗽  胃疼
You know, fake a cough, stomachache,

145
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,610
随你选  我无所谓
dealer's choice. I don't care.

146
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,330
装得像一点  好让我们离开
Just sell it and get us out of there.

147
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,220
可是你爸怎么办
But what about your dad?

148
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,000
他想让全家人聚在一起
He wants the family to be together.

149
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,410
我们总在一起
We are always together.

150
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,360
我们都听克莱尔讲了无数次
I mean, how many times do we have to hear Claire tell us

151
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,270
卢克对儿科医生的搞笑反驳了
Luke's hilarious comeback to the pediatrician?

152
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,720
天啊  我们真应该叫她"矮平房"
Oh, gosh. We should start calling her "Ranch house"...

153
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,660
因为她没有第二层[第二个故事]
Because she doesn't have a second story.

154
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,860
-不错嘛  -我知道  谢谢

"The hunger games" with all of us?

157
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,040
我的人生就是一出饥饿游戏
My whole life is a hunger game.

158
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,830
不然你以为我为什么对你这么刻薄
Why do you think I'm so mean to you?

159
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,850
找我的
That's for me!

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,630
可我还没喷古龙水
But I'm not wearing any cologne.

167
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,120
你之前知道这事吗
Did you know this was happening?

168
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
我现在也不知道这怎么回事
I don't even know what this is.

169
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,160
乔伊丝  这是曼尼
Joyce, this is Manny.

初次见面  甚感荣幸
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

171
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,250
不知小姐是否有意来杯气泡果酒呢
Can I offer you a glass of sparkling cider?

172
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,060
他可不是你说的那样
He's not how you described him.

173
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,610
别担心  你会爱他的
Uh, don't worry. You'll love him.

174
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,910
曼尼  说点浪漫的
Manny, say something romantic.

175
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,800
我没法突然打开浪漫模式  你来说些浪漫的
I can't just turn it on. You say something romantic.

176
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,660
衣服不错
Cool shirt. 

177
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,750
我能参观你房间吗
Can I see your room?

178
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,480
专门为你打扫了
Well, I didn't clean it for me.

179
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,720
他们单独上楼了
They're going upstairs alone.

180
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,860
-那是不允许的吧  -我不知道
- Is that even allowed? - I don't know.

181
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,940
-我们是不是得说点什么  -比如
- Should we say something? - Like what?

182
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,780
比如  "这是不可以的哦"
Like, "It's not okay"?

183
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,540
应该是吧  是吗
Well, maybe it is. Is it?

184
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,060
我不知道  我只是感觉
I don't know. I just feel like

185
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,610
我们没有尽到保姆的职责
we're not doing our job as babysitters.

186
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,910
我们当然尽到了
Of course we are.

187
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,410
我好冷  我还看到了一只郊狼
I'm cold, and I saw a coyote.

188
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,890
然后卢克对他说
And Luke turns to him and says,

189
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,860
布劳斯坦医生  不是吧  晚餐都不吃就想这样
"Dr. Blaustein, really? Not even dinner first?"

190
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,810
对天发誓  布劳斯坦医生亲口讲的
Hand to god! Dr. B. Told me himself!

191
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,170
我挺抱歉的  但我爱这个地方
You know, I'm sorry, but I love this place.

192
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,310
我知道这里有点糟糕
I know it's a little rough around the edges,

193
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,290
但我总是在这玩得很开心
but I've always had a good time here,

194
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,270
今晚感觉特别好

195
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,270
是呀
Yeah. 

196
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,700
你的俄式炸鸡怎么样
How's your chicken kiev?

197
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,200
-真心不错  -很好吃

198
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,240
-好吃  -对  仿佛身临俄国
- Tasty. - Yeah, tastes like Russia.

199
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,750
你还等什么  快说不舒服  
What are you waiting for? Get sick.

200
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,810
还没到时候  该说的时候我会说的
Not yet. I'll know when it's time.

201
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,060
亲爱的
Honey. 

202
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,950
-你睡着了  -是嘛
- You were sleeping. - I was.

203
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,690
真是不好意思  克莱尔
Ay, I'm so sorry, Claire.

204
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,270
绝不是因为你把卢克
It wasn't because you were telling again

205
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,830
和那个医生的故事又讲了一遍
The luke and the doctor story.

206
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,320
只是我最近太累了
It's just that I've been so tired lately.

207
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,960

你还好吧  她这一天都感觉不舒服
Are you okay? She's been feeling bad all day. 

209
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,570
对  我想我可能是染上什么小病了
Yeah, you know. I think I might be coming down with a little something.

210
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,510
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

211
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,400
就是啊  我之前用她的杯子喝水了
I know. I drank out of her glass earlier.

212
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,020
-不是  她用了我们的借口  -什么
- No. She's stealing our excuse. - What?

213
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,220
亲爱的
Honey.

214
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,880
歌洛莉亚  醒醒
Wake up, Gloria!

215
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,680
淡定  如果留下掌印  我要遭白眼了

我送你上楼去
I'm gonna walk her upstairs.

00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,410
别别别别别  别动
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

221
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,640
继续狂欢  我会尽快回来
Keep the party going. I'll be back as soon as I can.

222
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,150

There it is. Now?

223
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,100
不是  我有东西卡喉咙了
No, I have something stuck in my throat.

224
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,070
真遗憾没有莉莉在这里给你做海姆利克急救
It's too bad Lily's not here to give you the heimlich.

225
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,450

232
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,920
我只是希望我
Yeah. I just hope I don't hold up

我不知道  他们应该都走了

你还要火焰樱桃吗
You still want the cherries jubilee?

239
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,090

我要睡觉了
I'm gonna hit the sack.

245
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,230
我们刚被一个人放了鸽子

那你得呆在这了
Well, now you have to stay,

257
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,090
因为这些人在《桃花心木》后
since none of these guys have seen me

258
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,180
就没在电影里见过我
in anything since "Mahogany."

259
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,930
-那片我也没看过  -我也是
- Never even saw that. - Me either.

260
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,720
你们开玩笑呢
You're kidding.

比利·迪扮演一名市议员
Billy Dee's an alderman

262
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,850
设法让戴安娜·罗斯待在芝加哥
trying to keep Diana Ross in Chicago,

263
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,740
而不是成为
rather than become

264
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,190
一名国际模特和设计师
an international model and designer.

265

我儿子逼我和他一起看的
My son made me watch it with him.

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,870
很好  我可不想由我来告诉你这事
Oh, good. I didn't want to be the one to tell you.

268
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,160
抱歉  先生  打扰一下
Excuse me! Sir, excuse me!

269
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,610
他是故意的
He's doing this on purpose!

270
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,230
他可能只是没注意到我们
He probably just doesn't notice us.

271
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,390
他怎么可能没看到我们
How can he not notice us?

272
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,420
我们是这里仅有的穿了袖子的
We're the only people in here in sleeves!

273
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,160
嘿  你想要什么

抱歉  年轻人  我先来的

275
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,500
年轻人  你为什么不叫他毛头小子
Young man? Why don't you just call him whipper-snapper?

276
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,590
这也太荒谬了  我们竟然连酒都喝不到
This is ridiculous. We can't even get a drink.

277
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,550
这里都是11岁的  而且我好热[性感]
Everyone in here's 11, and I'm hot!

278
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,650
如果我们够性感  现在就不会没酒喝了  
If we were hot, we'd be drinking right now.

279
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,920

现在就可以享受火焰樱桃了
We'd be enjoying cherries jubilee right now!

我刚只是觉得被无视了  会好起来的
I was just feeling invisible! It'll get better!

他们在里面好久了
They've been in there forever.

292
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,210
做点什么啊  你是管事的
Do something. You're in charge.

293
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,690
得了吧  我们都知道我是有名无实的
Oh, please. We both know I'm just a figurehead here.

294
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,310
你真认为他们在里面做什么吗  他才12岁
You really think they're doing something in there? He's 12.

295
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,540
他14了  但你们这么亲密真感人啊
He's 14, but it's touching how close you are.

296
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,930
好吧
Fine.

297
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,020
你们干什么
what do you want?

298
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,020
你得把门开着
You have to keep your door open.

299
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,050
-为什么  -你为什么要关上门
- Why? - Uh, well, why do you need it closed?

300
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,670
因为我们正要亲热呢
Because we're gonna make out.

301
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,360
你...
Well, you...

302
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,280
你不能关着门
You can't have your door closed.

303
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,850
为什么  你们想观摩还是怎么着
Why? Do you wanna to watch or something?

304
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,680
那有点变态啊
That's weird.

305
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,890
我们才不想看呢
Of course we don't wanna watch.

306
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,970
那就好
Perfect.

307
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,160
-但你不能...  -你这是...
- But you can't... - What are you d...

308
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,030
什么情况
What just happened?

309
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,640
要来一杯迪尔加多酒吗
Can I offer you a Pinja Delgado?

310
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,160
是我自创的调酒
It's my own concoction.

311
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,020
里面有什么
What's in it?

312
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,870
这么说吧  这酒清爽  甜美
Let's just say it's cool, it's sweet,

313
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,060
还富有奇思妙想
and it's not afraid to embrace its own whimsy.

314
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,790
我不是那个意思
I'm not saying that.

315
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,280
我也不会喝的
I'm not drinking it, either.

316
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,690
那...新年你有什么新决心吗
So... You making any resolutions?

317
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,150
有  绝不再和不认识的人约会
Yeah. No more blind dates.

318
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,240
你好刻薄
You're mean.

319
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,110
她说得对  乔伊丝  你真刻薄
You know, she's right, Joyce. You are mean.

320
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,160
我如此热情地款待你
I've been a gracious host

321
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,810
你却这么无礼  坏脾气  又无聊
while you've been rude, sullen, and dull.

322
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,770
失陪了  抱歉我不想让我的新年
You'll forgive me if I choose not to start the new year

323
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,230
以如此消极的方式展开
on such a negative note.

324
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,350
对了  你一会儿要是想吃西兰花
Oh, and if you're hungry for broccoli later,

325
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,010
可以去你的牙缝里找一块儿
you'll find a piece in your teeth.

326
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,790
那该死的小路在哪儿啊
Where is this stupid path?

327
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,030
我们走了好久了
We've been walking forever.

328
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,280
会找到的
We'll find it.

329
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,250
你有没有觉得那个服务生不太对劲
Did that bellman seem a little off to you?

330
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,080
没错  没准这里根本没有温泉
Oh, totally. Maybe there is no hot spring.

331
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,270
没准这是密谋杀害我们的计划中的一步
Maybe this is all part of an elaborate plan to kill us.

332
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,710
你干嘛吓唬我
Why would you even say that?

333
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,650
我只是活跃一下气氛
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

334
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,640
你情绪很紧绷
You seem so tense.

335
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,470
放松  这是在探险  有趣的探险
Come on. This is an adventure. This is fun.

336
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,780
我不想探什么险
I don't wanna have an adventure.

337
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,940
我不需要有趣的探险  我想和你滚床单
I don't wanna have fun. I wanna have sex with you.

338
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,220
什  什么
Wha--what?

339
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,320
别让我重复
Don't make me say it again.

340
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,380
不  我想听你再说一遍
No, I want you to say it again.

341
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,270
这次最好能叫出我的名字
Maybe throw my name in there this time.

342
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,470
克莱尔  你怎么了
Claire, what's going on?

343
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
你知道我们有一个月没滚过了吗
Do you know that it's been a month?

344
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,280
-没那么久  -有  一整个月
- No, it hasn't. - Yes, it has.

345
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,400
上次还是感恩节后那天
Day after Thanksgiving.

346
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,930
我记忆犹新  因为那天我在预算内
I remember because I came in under budget

347
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,400
买到了所有要买的圣诞礼物
on all of my Christmas gifts,

348
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,980
你知道这种事多么让我兴奋
And you know how that gets me going.

349
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,020
-没错  -是啊
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah.

350
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,230
我还开玩笑说你衣冠不整
I made that joke about your clothes being half-off.

351
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,970
但我们还是滚了床单
And yet we still did it,

352
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,440
因为以前我们就是那么干柴烈火
'cause that's the kind of people we used to be.

353
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,170
现在这是怎么了
What happened?

354
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,480
没怎么  我们一直很忙
Nothing happened. We're busy.

355
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,260
节日嘛  再加上迪迪又来了
It was the holidays. Dede was here.

356
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,320
你知道她总是让我
You know, she has a way of...

357
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,880
性欲全无
shutting that whole thing down.

358
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,350
但我们现在成了那样的夫妻吗
But is this who we are now?

359
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,940
先是一个月不滚床单  接着就是一年
I mean, first it's a month, then it's a year,

360
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,040
然后我们开始各睡各床
Then we're sleeping in twin beds

361
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,150
你会叫我"老妈"
and you're calling me "mother".

362
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,170
我无法忍受
And I can't even bear it,

363
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,880
因为我们成了我祖父母
'cause we're just like my grandp--

364
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,520
我们去找到那个温泉
Let's go find that hot spring

365
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,380
然后以温泉中的激情一夜
And start this new year off with...

366
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,820
开启我们新的一年
sex in a hot spring.

367
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,610
好了  好了
All right, all right.

368
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,840
我们接下来要做什么
Where--where should we try next?

369
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,580
-我嚷了吗  我嚷了  -是的  
- Am I yelling? I'm yelling. - Yes.

370
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,930
也许我们应该去买些冻酸奶吃
Yeah. Maybe we should just go get some frozen yogurt

371
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,960
然后回房间睡觉
And call it a night.

372
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,800
别  小卡  来嘛
No, Cam, come on.

373
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,890
我们不能再一次在除夕夜
We can't have another New Year's eve

374
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,680
撑不到午夜就睡觉
where we don't even make it to midnight.

375
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,650
我...节日的一切
I... This entire holiday

376
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,840
都在提醒着我  岁月流逝
is just a giant reminder of how the clock is ticking.

377
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,140
每过一秒
You know, each passing second

378
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,120
我们就离死亡更进一步
is just bringing us that much closer to death.

379
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,150
至于吗你  就因为我提出吃冻酸奶
All this because I suggested some fro-yo?

380
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,630
我...我好讨厌变老的感觉
I'm... I'm sick of feeling old.

381
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,930
我真的想狂欢一下
I-I really need this.

382
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,730
好吧
Okay.

383
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,360
让我们狂欢到午夜
Let's get you to midnight.

384
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,750
好
'kay.

385
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,550
看  他和我们年纪差不多
Oh, look, he's our age.

386
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,570
他去的地方  一定也适合我们
Wherever he's going, I'm sure he'll fit right in.

387
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,630
好吧
Okay.

388
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,550
好吧  我不予评判
Okay, no judgment.

389
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,640
这种生活方式完全没问题
Perfectly acceptable lifestyle.

390
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,280
-只是不适合我们  -没错
- Just not for us. - No!

391
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,220
但我们不会就这么放弃的  对吗
Okay, but we are not giving up, all right?

392
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,390
我们就像《三只熊的故事》里的金发小妞
We're like goldilocks.

393
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,390
{\an8}[童话故事  讲述一个金发少女闯入了三只熊的领地]

394
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,670
刚刚第一家酒吧太幼齿
The first bar was too young,

395
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,650
第二家又...不管第二家那是什么
The second was... Whatever that was,

396
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,280
第三家一定就完美了
And the third will be just right.

397

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,970
我没说错吧
I mean... Right?

401
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,190
这里  就是这家
Here. This one.

402
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,110
你不是想感受年轻吗
You wanted to feel young.

403
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,300
此刻宛若少男
And I do.

404
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,640
对不起  我总是拒人千里之外
I'm sorry. I push people away.

405
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,100
我知道自己有这毛病  但就是改不了
I feel myself do it, but I can't stop.

406
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,400
你连自己都不喜欢  很难喜欢上别人
It's hard to like someone when you don't like yourself.

407
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,360
你说得对
You're right.

408
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
你有那么多优点
You have so many good qualities.

409
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,490
魅力四射  聪明伶俐  活泼阳光
You're attractive, you're witty, you're bright.

410
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,760
真希望你能看到我眼中的你
I just wish you could see yourself through my eyes.

411
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,090
你真是个好朋友
Aw, you're such a good friend.

412
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,330
朋友  闹半天只是朋友吗
Friend? That's where this is headed?

413
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,380
友谊地久天长嘛
Well... Friendships last longer.

414
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,590
这段可不行  我朋友够多了
Not this one. I've got enough friends.

So what's the plan, Haley?

417
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,560
我得进去  那里面可是我们的亲弟弟
I'm going in. That's our baby brother up there.

418
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,620
我还没准备好接受这一切
I'm not ready for all of this.

419
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,260
女孩儿还有荷尔蒙什么的  太恶心了
The girls, the hormones-- it's gross.

420
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,270
我们不能就这么闯进去
Well, we can't just barge in.

421
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,820
上次闯进爸妈房间  那场景还在我脑中
I'm still trying to get the image of mom and dad

422
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,650
挥之不去...天呐  又浮现了
out of my... oh, god, it's back.

423
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,190
我进来啦
I'm coming in!

424
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,590
你这是干什么
What are you doing?

425
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,320
把洗好的衣服送过来
Just putting away some laundry.

426
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,270
那是个胸罩吧
That's a bra.

427
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,480
以及一块桌布
And a tablecloth.

428
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,700
你不能一会儿再来吗
Can't you do this later?

429
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,560
不好意思  你妈知道你在这里吗
Excuse me. Does your mother know you're here?

430
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,860
-知道  -她知道我们家长不在家吗
- Yes. - Does she know our parents aren't?

431
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,530
知道
Yeah.

432
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,000
停顿太长  没有目光接触
Big pause, no eye contact.

433
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,860
姐撒谎的本事可比你强多了
I was so much better at this than you.

434
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,690
-你得走了  -不  她不能走
- You're out. - No, she's not.

435
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,170
不  她得走  很晚了  你才13岁
Yes, she is. It's late, you're 13...

436
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,300
-14岁  -才14岁
- 14. - 14,

437
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,230
除非这位妮可·贱奇
and unless Nicole Bitchie here

438
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,590
想让我打给她家长  揭发她撒了谎
wants me to call her parents and tell them she lied...

439
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,270
我得走了  再见  卢克
I better go. Bye, Luke.

440
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,390
等等  为什么她得走
Wait. Why does she have to go?

441
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,310
因为我让她走她就得走
Because I said so.

442
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,440
又不是你说了算
You're not the boss.

443
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,830
别跟你姐姐顶嘴
Don't talk back to your sister.

444
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,180
我恨你们
Ugh! I hate you!

445
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,900
你现在恨我  以后会感激我的
You hate me now, but someday you'll thank me!

446
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,740
我想我欠妈妈一个大大的道歉
I think I owe mom a huge apology.

447
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,510
还有没有人管我了
Is anyone watching me?

448
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,180
对A加对8
Aces and eights.

449
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,110
天妒红颜  我有三张J[同名电影]
Lady Sings the Blues. Three Jacks.

450
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,750
对不住了  比利·迪
Sorry, Billy Dee,

451
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,640
哈利王子在赌城全裸
But where do you go to tattle on prince Harry

452
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,350
你要向谁告状啊
when he's naked in vegas?

453
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,520
Q的顺子[直接找女王告状]
Straight to the queen.

454
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,840
好了  我不玩了
Well, that's it. I'm out.

455
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
我也是
Me, too.

456
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,470
见鬼  差不多11点了
Oh, hell, it's almost 11:00.

457
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,620
我得去星光室了
I gotta do my set in the starlight room,

458
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,850
我已经错过肉馅饼了
and I'm missing a pasty.

459
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,950
大家这是怎么了  还早呢
Oh, what's the matter with everybody? It's early yet.

460
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,910
就是  我到这里后
Yeah, I'm having fun

461
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,900
第一次感觉到开心
for the first time since I got here.

462
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,690
杰
Jay?

463
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,140
她来多久了
How long has she been there?

464
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,450
你在这里做什么
What are you doing here?

465
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,960
歌洛莉亚
Gloria...

466
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,490
大家都放我鸽子
Everybody ditched me,

467
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,730
这些人邀请我玩扑克
these guys invited me to play poker,

468
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,860
瞧瞧我旁边坐的是谁
and look who I'm sitting next to.

469
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,550
她太年轻不会知道的
Oh, she has no idea.

470
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,270
你好  我是比利·迪·威廉姆斯
Hello, I'm Billy Dee Williams.

471
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,780
你好  我是她老婆歌洛莉亚
Hello. I'm Gloria dee wife.

472
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,150
杰  差不多午夜了  我们忘了买葡萄
Jay, it's almost midnight, and we forgot to buy my grapes.

473
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,170
有叫客房服务吗  说不定有葡萄
Did you try room service? They probably have grapes.

474
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,110
就没新鲜的
Oh, nothing fresh.

475
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,480
但总是可以从什锦水果罐头中捞到
But you can always fish some out of a can of fruit cocktail.

476
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,560
杰  你知道我需要真正的葡萄来许愿
Jay, you know that I need real grapes for my wishes.

477
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,120
那是哥伦比亚传统  只是适度的疯癫而已
It's a Colombian tradition. It's only moderately insane.

478
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,580
我家有葡萄
Well, I have grapes at my house.

479
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,800
不  我可不想搅黄你的新年安排
No, I don't want you to blow new year's.

480
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,480
拜托  每晚对比利·迪来说都是除夕夜
Oh, please. Every night is new year's for Billy Dee.

481
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,540
我喜欢你  比利·迪
I like you, Billy Dee.

482
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,730
到了午夜  就吃葡萄许愿
So at midnight, you eat them and then you make your wishes.

483
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,410
听起来有些印象
Well, that sounds vaguely familiar.

484
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,510
我可能在和夏洛
I might have heard about that

485
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,560
拍《爱船》的时候听说过
when I did that "Love boat" with Charo.

486
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,670
你认识夏洛吗
You know Charo?

487
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,540
他可迷恋夏洛了
He's so obsessed with Charo.

488
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,220
不是吧
No kidding.

489
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,330
我的天
Oh, my god.

490
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,820
经典劳斯莱斯险路车
A classic rolls corniche.

491
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,860
我这辈子都超迷这款车
I have been in love with this car my whole life.

492
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,250
在我的村子里  如果你没开这种车
In my village, if you didn't drive one of these,

493
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,420
你都不好意思叫自己是毒品大王
you couldn't call yourself a drug lord.

494
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,540
你想开吗
Would you like to drive it?

495
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,240
那不是明知故问吗
Does the bear sit in the woods?

496
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,670
典型的夏洛
Classic Charo.

497
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,470
那么 
So...

498
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,730
我的崩溃值得吗
Was it worth my meltdown?

499
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,130
总是值得
It always is.

500
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,310
只有我们两个  在沙漠的夜空下
Just you and me, under the desert sky.

501
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,030
我是沙漠枭雄[电影名]
I'm Lawrence of Arabia,

502
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,390
你是
You're Mrs...

503
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,770
枭雄的太太
Of arabia.

504
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,970
你们好啊
Hey there.

505
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,080
我的妈呀
Oh, my god.

506
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,820
太好了  你们是最先到的
Sweet. You're the first ones here.

507
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,910
欢迎 
Welcome.

508
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,090
欢迎来到哪里
Uh, welcome to what?

509
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,000
来到"除衣夜"  有看到宣传单吗
To nude year's eve. You saw the flyer?

510
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,820
没有
No.

511
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,420
我告诉他们的
I told them.

512
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,080
罗比
Robby.

513
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,730
我  哇  "除衣夜"
So I--whoa. Nude year's eve?

514
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,230
-你说的原来是"除衣夜"  -真有才的近音词
- You said nude year's eve. - It's clever.

515
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,540
对  我们是棕榈泉裸体协会的

516
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,510
这是我们庆祝新年的方式 
It's how we celebrate the new year.

517
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,460
-我看出来了  -清新的感觉  犹如初生婴儿

518
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,620
裸着
Naked.

519
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,330
对  我看出来了
Yeah. I got that. 

520
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,530
我的天  我们得离开这里
Oh, my god. We have to get out of here.

521
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,840
我们得离开这里
We have to get out of here.

522
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,980
我们的衣服被压下那堆下面
Our clothes are trapped under that pile.

523
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,110
你真想裸着站起来
You really wanna stand there naked

524
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,090
在那堆裤子中翻来翻去吗
sifting through all those drawstring pants?

525
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,400
-好吧  挪挪  -挪过去
- Okay. Scooting over. - Just... Just scootch in.

526
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,970

527
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,790
菲尔  有东西碰到我了
Phil, something just touched me,

528
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,540
不是你身上的
And it's not from your side.

529
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,060
谁要香槟
Who wants champagne?

530
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,130
我要
Oh, I'll have some.

531
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,070

谢谢
Thank you.

534
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,360
我们得赶紧开溜
We gotta make a run for it.

535
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,100
现在走太失礼了
Well, now it's just gonna seem rude.

536
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,890
菲尔
Phil.

537
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,380
我太爱这辆车了
I love this car so much!

538
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,990
你接下来要带我们去哪里  比利·迪
Where you gonna take us next, Billy Dee?

539
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:11,100
你会看到令你眼前一亮的惊喜
A surprise that's gonna blow your mind.

540
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,730
叫我比利就行了
And just call me Billy.

541
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,620
才不干呢
Not doin' it.

542
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,390
这是那边一桌的先生们送的
And these are from the gentlemen at that table over there.

543
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,680
免费酒水  免费酒水又来了

Thank you. Thank--they can't hear me.

545
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,630
谢谢
Thank you!

546
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:29,450
这肯定就是模特的感觉
This is what models must feel like.

547
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,070
打扰下  有没有人跟你说过
Excuse me, but has anyone ever told you

548
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,170
你就是年轻版的范·强森[演员]
you look like a young Van Johnson?

549
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,860
没人说过  不过你真会说话
Oh, no. That-- that's so sweet, though.

550
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,980
多谢
Thank you.

551
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,390
他给你"免费入场券"呢
Free pass?

552
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,460
在你手机上找出范·强森的照片
Pull up Van Johnson on your phone.

553
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,860
我需要知道是该欢喜还是该担忧
I need to know how I feel about that.

554
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,500
他可帅了  你就高兴吧
He was gorgeous. You're fine.

555
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,220
这样可真爽  被人夸  有人请喝酒
This is nice, huh? Compliments, free drinks.

556
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,580
还有什么比这更爽的
What could be better?

557
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,710
好了  先生们  差不多午夜了
Alright gentlemen! Almost midnight!

558
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,940
嘴巴嘟起来吧
Pucker up.

559
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,140
新年真奇怪
New Year's is so weird,

560
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,520
会让你想到时光流逝
the way it makes you think about time.

561
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,540
十  九  八
Ten... Nine... Eight...

562
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,890
小卡
Cam. 

563
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:58,430
我想正是这样
I think that's why

564
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,010
人们才给自己巨大压力  要在新年玩得开心
people put so much pressure on themselves to have fun.

565
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,820
七  六  五
seven... six... five...

566
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,720
我想我大概明白了
I mean, I guess I sorta get it.

567
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,870
四  三  二  一
four... three... two... one!

568
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,160
快点  许愿吧
Quick, quick! Make your wishes!

569
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,640
就像现在  我只希望能让时间放慢脚步
Like right now I wish I could just slow down time,

570
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,770
因为我完全没有准备好他长大成人
'cause I am so not ready for him to grow up yet.

571
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,430
我懂
I know.

572
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,360
我希望他永远是我们的笨弟弟
I want him to stay our stupid little brother.

573
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,760
新年快乐
Hey, happy new year.

574
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,640
你也快乐
You too.

575
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,110
我的天  这里面放了什么
Oh, my god, what is in this?

576
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,900
抱歉  那杯是我的
Oh. Sorry. That one's mine. 

577
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,030
我发誓  我太紧张了
And I swear to you, I was so nervous,

578
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,090
我想我穿上了别人的内裤
I think I might have put on somebody else's underwear.

579
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,010
我是说真的
I'm not kidding. 

580
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,360
我爱死这故事了
I love this story.

581
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,910
-几乎和你的一样棒  范·强森  -妈呀
- Almost as good as yours, Van Johnson. - Oh, my god!

582
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,740
看  杰来了
Oh, look. Here comes Jay.

583
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,750
我好内疚  他错过了所有的精彩
I feel bad he missed all this fun. 

584
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,100
-爸  -瞧他们回来了  我忠诚的家人
- Hi, dad. - Look, they're back. My devoted family.

585
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,340
各位  这是我们亲爱的朋友  比利·迪·威廉姆斯
Everyone, this is our dear friend, Billy Dee Williams.

586
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,920
天啊  《星球大战》里的蓝多
Oh, my god, it's Lando.

587
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,910
恕我冒昧  威廉姆斯先生  
Excuse me, Mr. Williams,

588
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,640
我得告诉你
I just have to tell you,

589
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,670
我从小就好爱你
I've loved you since I was a little boy.

590
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,130
我现在真是"求星大战"
I'm so Starstruck right now.

591
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,030
你一定是米奇尔吧
Well, you must be Mitchell.

592
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,310
你的事杰都告诉我了
Jay told me all about you.
