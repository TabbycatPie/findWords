1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,630
你在拍吗
Are you getting this?

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,450
我在拍
I'm getting the shot.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,400
但我搞不懂你在做什么
I'm just not getting what you're trying to do.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,290
我们可是在澳大利亚  地球的底端啊
We're in Australia -- it's on the bottom of the globe,

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,440
所以除了我  所有人都是上下颠倒的
so everyone here but me is upside-down.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,150
地理知识
It's geography.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,380
现在正好可以告诉你
It's a good time to tell you --

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,560
卢克一岁时  我把他头朝下掉地上了
I dropped Luke on his head when he was 1.

9
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,000
好吧  我也来
Okay, I'm up.

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,520
你也把他掉地上了吗
Did you drop him, too?

11
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,880
帮我拉下腿  伙计
Grab my leg, buddy.

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
走着
Here we go.

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,750
我来自"下面"那片土地
I come from the land down under.

14
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,300
他不是的
He doesn't.

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,130
我父母在澳洲度蜜月时怀上我的
I was conceived in Australia on my parents' honeymoon.

16
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,710
那是个浪漫的仲夏之夜  是那边的夏天
It was a romantic summer night -- their summer --

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,150
在公园里的一条毯子上
on a blanket in the park.

18
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,690
我现在还留着那条毯子
I still have that blanket.

19
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,050
菲尔的妈妈留给我们一笔钱去那里旅游
Phil's mom left us money for a trip there,

20
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,570
家里其他人知道后
and when the rest of the family found out,

21
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,080
都要跟着一起来
they all just jumped on board.

22
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,830
我妈的外公是澳大利亚人
My mom's grandfather was Australian,

23
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,990
她每年夏天
and she'd spend her summers

24
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,180
也就是那里的冬天  都会去看望他
-- their winters -- visiting him.

25
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,990
对她而言那是个特别的地方
It was a very special place for her.

26
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,760
她一直希望我去看看
She always wanted me to see it.

27
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,540
等等  你还留着那条毯子吗
Wait -- you still have that blanket?

28
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,520
是啊  傻瓜  就是我们床上那条
Yeah, silly. It's the one on our bed.

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,030
你确定不要来点维吉麦酱吗  歌洛莉亚
You sure you don't want some of this vegemite, Gloria?

30
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,290
你会错过美味的
You don't know what you're missing.

31
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,790
不知道里面有什么我是不会吃的
Ay, I don't eat anything unless I know what's in it.

32
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,570
我看过这女人狼吞虎咽地吃猪鼻子
I've seen this woman scarf down a pig's nose.

33
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,850
有时候  人得穿过大半个地球
Sometimes, one must travel halfway across the globe

34
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,990
才能看清家的模样
to get the clearest view of home.

35
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,380
一路上都这样
This was my whole flight.

36
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,440
她在说什么
What's she talking about?

37
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,960
我的大学申请论文
My college-application essay.

38
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,420
他们喜欢成熟有阅历的学生
They want students who are worldly.

39
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,060
你何不写我们的夏威夷之行呢
Oh, why don't you write about our trip to Hawaii

40
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,890
你还直接捧着椰子喝呢
when you drank straight from a coconut?

41
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,970
我觉得哈佛会收到很多
I feel like Harvard's gonna get

42
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,370
那样的论文  所以
a lot of those, so...

43
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,700
各位  我要感激有幸成为
Hey, guys, I just wanted to say thanks

44
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,820
这场庄严的澳大利亚朝拜之行的一员
for being a part of this pilgrimage to majestic Australia,

45
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,580
这里曾是罪犯的流放地
which was once a penal colony.

46
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,280
成熟一点
Grow up.

47
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,190
这里对我妈妈真的很特别
This place was really special to my mom.

48
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,660
她其实给我留了一张
She actually left me a list of things

49
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,690
她觉得我们该做的事情清单
that she thought we should do --

50
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,380
去大堡礁游玩
Visit the great Barrier Reef,

51
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,600
去看丛林
See the bush...

52
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,490
真要这样吗
Really?

53
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,380
还有爬悉尼海港大桥
...and climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

54
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,860
你们觉得怎么样  伙伴们
what do you say, mates?

55
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,750
抱歉  亲爱的
I'm sorry, honey,

56
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,710
但你也知道我有恐高症的
but you know how I am with heights.

57
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,570
所以你才从不穿高跟鞋吗
Ah. Is that why you never wear high heels?

58
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,250
你们都愿意一起来的吧
You guys are with me, right?

59
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,950
-当然不  -不  我才不去
- Absolutely not. - Nah, I'm not doing that.

60
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,480
-真的吗  -不去
- Really? - No.

61
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,490
不必担心
No worries.

62
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,550
这句是澳大利亚英语
That's Australian.

63
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,550
我...有必要的话我自己来
I'll, uh, I'll do that one on my own if I have to.

64
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,450
我只是很激动我们能一起来这里
I'm just so excited we're all here together.

65
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,850
-其实我们得走了  -对啊  所以
- Actually, we have to go. - Yeah, so...

66
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,640
以前我们认识个来自澳大利亚的家伙
Back in the day, we knew this guy from Australia.

67
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,070
-是新西兰  -都一样啦
- New Zealand. - Same thing.

68
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,960
他没什么朋友  于是我们很同情他
He didn't have a lot of friends, and we felt sorry for him,

69
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,100
但其实他有点惹人烦
but the truth is, he was kind of annoying.

70
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,190
他总是很兴奋地说个不停
He was one of those guys that was always on.

71
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,640
后来他的签证过期  让我们松了口气
Big relief when his visa ran out.

72
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,090
总之  我并没有错
Anyway, through no fault of my own --

73
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:16,710
等等  不  等等
Wait, no, wait --

74
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,960
你在Facebook上发布说
you announced on Facebook

75
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,390
我们要去澳大利亚  而他就住在那里
that we were going to Australia, which is where he lives.

76
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,110
费格斯邀请我们吃午饭  我无法拒绝
Fergus invited us to lunch. I couldn't say no.

77
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,770
换我就会拒绝
I could have said no.

78
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,180
所以你的Facebook只有12个好友
Which is why you have 12 friends on Facebook.

79
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,980
克莱尔  亲爱的  我得告诉你
Claire, honey, I got to tell you,

80
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,250
汉诺威那单生意你真的干得太漂亮了
you really knocked it out of the park on the Hanover deal.

81
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,870
拜托  老爸  都是你的功劳啦
Oh, come on, dad. That was all you.

82
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,790
不  是你的功劳
No, it was you.

83
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,100
不  是你啦
No, it was you!

84
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:37,180
是你  是你的宝贝项目
It was you. It was your baby.

85
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,300
一路上都这样
This was my whole flight.

86
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,420
克莱尔第一次在公司带头做项目
Claire took the lead on her first project at the company

87
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,300
干得很漂亮
and scored a big one.

88
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,800
最棒的是  她打败了那个来自
Best part is, she beat out that arrogant gasbag Earl Norton

89
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,000
橱柜橱柜橱柜橱柜公司的傲慢话唠厄尔
over at Closets, Closets, Closets, Closets.

90
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,010
我真希望我能看到
I wish I could see the look

91
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,070
他那张蠢脸上的表情表情表情表情
on his stupid face, face, face, face.

92
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,380
先干什么呢
So, what's first?

93
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,530
我想曼尼想去歌剧院
I think Manny wants to see the Opera House.

94
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,320
坐了那么长时间的飞机
Actually, it was a long flight.

95
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,010
我想我们要不去邦戴海滩上走走好了
I was thinking maybe just... Hang out on Bondi beach.

96
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,040
好主意  曼尼
That's a great idea, Manny.

97
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,240
邦戴海滩上都是光着上身的美女
Bondi beach is topless.

98
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,130
感谢到到网的介绍
Thank you, TripAdvisor.

99
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,000
那就去海滩吧
Beach it is.

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,510
开始我们的澳洲派对吧
Let's get this Aussie party started!

101
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,870
天啊  你的嘴怎么了
Oh, my god. What's wrong with your mouth?

102
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,590
你的嘴唇好厚
Ay! Your lips are huge!

103
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,930
我觉得你是对维吉麦酱过敏了
I think you're allergic to the ve-he-mi-te.

104
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,990
别担心
No worries.

105
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,950
我会有点担心的
I'd be a little worried.

有没有可能在鸡蛋孵出小鸡前

她简直是个饭桶
You know? And she's a total bogan.

173
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,090
她说  我要应付五桌客人呢

她这样舞步滑动
She's sashaying with the legs.

176

我就经常跟我已故的外婆沟通

或许她现在就在我的身边

230
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,910
不会  她讨厌坐飞机
No, she doesn't like to fly.

00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,720
最后我们跟费格斯在一起
We ended up spending a little more time with Fergus

258
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,500
又多待了一会儿
than we planned.

259
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,650
说实话  这给我们上了一课
Which, honestly, felt like growth to us,

260
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,140
-没错  -因为我觉得
- Yes. - Because I think

261
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,020
有时我们还没了解别人就乱下定论
sometimes we judge people before we get to know them.

262
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,690
难以相信他们竟然让你进来
I cannot believe they let us in here.

263
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,000
你到底有多出名
How famous are you?

264
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,460
有时我觉得我才是供人观赏的动物
Well, sometimes, I feel like I'm the one in the zoo.

265
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,620
我跟这考拉唯一的区别
Only difference between me and this guy

266
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,930
就是我不会尿在你身上
is I won't pee on you.

267
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:40,930
对吧
Right?

268
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,470
说真的  它们会尿在你身上
Seriously, they will pee on you.

269
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,520
真的吗  它会尿在我们身上
Oh, for real? He will pee on us?

270
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,650
-好吧  -真的吗
- Okay. - Is that so?

271
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,280
结果发现  我们有很多共同点
Turns out, we have a lot in common.

272
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,110
比如我们都不喜欢排队
For example, we all hate standing in lines.

273
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,650
记得把照片发我一份噢
Make sure I get copies of those.

274
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,910
他是不是很幽默
Isn't he funny?

275
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,850
我们跟他是一起的  所以我们就先
We're with him, so we're just gonna...

276
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:54,770
快来  你们先进
Come on. Through you go.

277
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,260
对不住  费格斯总是这样
Sorry. Classic Fergus,

278
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,770
带我们直接进来
getting us in like this.

279
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,370
小卡
Cam.

280
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,330
下一家礼品店在哪里
Where's the next gift shop?

281
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,460
继续逛礼品店我会疯的  莉莉
I cannot look at another souvenir, Lily.

282
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,160
都是因为你
You did this.

283
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,920
莉莉  放轻松
Lily, relax.

284
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,350
你会找到完美的纪念品的
You'll find the perfect one.

285
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,090
我也想相信你
I want to believe you,

286
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,520
但刚才那个救生员真的是帅到爆棚
but that lifeguard was the cutest boy I've ever seen.

287
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,630
我知道
I know.

288
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,840
你们好
Hey, guys!

289
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,120
在商务中心找到了他们
Found 'em in the business center.

290
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,220
快点走  我们还要赶去丛林的车呢
Come on. We got to catch the bus to the bush.

291
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,620
你们什么时候醒来的
What time did you wake up?

292
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,290
凌晨五点  克莱尔的职业道德感很强
5:00 A.M. Claire has an incredible work ethic.

293
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,850
[Yung-mi人名音似young me]

294
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,850
她跟我年轻时一模一样
She's like a young me.

295
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,520
杨蜜是我们来自韩国的会计
Yung-mi was our accountant from Korea.

296
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,850
操劳过度而死
Died at her desk.

297
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,150
好了  别再谈工作了
Okay, enough work.

298
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,850
-该享受我们的假期了  -没错
- It's time to enjoy our vacation. - Yeah.

299
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,130
知道了  我们只需再弄一下...
Yeah, we just got to finish up a few quick, little thi--

300
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,200
不行  工作结束
No, you're done.

301
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,700
-好吧  不工作了  -我们走吧
- Done. We're done. - Let's go.

302
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,100
杰  我很想你
Jay, I miss you.

303
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,220
而且我一人已经保护不了菲尔了
And besides, I don't know that I can keep Phil safe anymore.

304
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,980
我觉得他会死在这里
I think he's going to die here.

305
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,750
是费格斯的短信
Oh, it's Fergus.

306
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,550
什么  他为什么只给你发短信
What? Why did he text you and not me?

307
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,690
他邀请我们去休・杰克曼的游艇派对
He invited us to a party today on Hugh Jackman's yacht.

308
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,880
什么  今天吗  不要啊
What?! Not today! No!

309
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,990
我想见休・杰克曼
I want to meet Hugh Jackman!

310
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,120
我也是  我也是
I do, too. I do, too.

311
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,840
但我们不能再放家人的鸽子了
But, you know, w-we can't bail on my family again.

312
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,050
这样我们就真的成脑残粉了
That makes us complete star you-know-what-ers.

313
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,820
再说了  小卡  这也会很有意思的
Plus, Cam, this will be fun, too.

314
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,540
每个人都带了防晒霜和防虫剂吧
Everybody have their sunscreen and bug spray?

315
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,020
我带了蛇咬伤急救包
I got the snakebite kit.

316
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,240
各位  我们有个坏消息
Hey, guys, we just got some really bad news.

317
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,520
是啊  所以
Yeah, so...

318
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,050
行走于澳大利亚人祖先曾走过的小径

319
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,320
让我变得  怎样呢

320
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,550
难以忍受
Unbearable?

321
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,850
幸运的话
Now, if we're lucky,

322
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,590
我们会见到一些著名的澳大利亚本地物种
we'll see some of Australia's more famous indigenous species --

323
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,640
袋鼠  澳洲野狗  考拉
kangaroo, dingoes, koala.

324
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,320
问个问题
Quick question.

325
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,550
很好  又一个问题
Oh, good -- another one.

326
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,270
那些小袋鼠  或者说幼兽出生的时候
Isn't it true that baby kangaroos, or -- or joeys,

327
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,740
真的没有后腿吗
are born without hind legs?

328
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,570
是的
Yes.

329
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,590
你又一次正确回答了自己的问题
Once again, you've correctly answered your own question.

330
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,140
刚收到橱柜橱柜橱柜公司的厄尔的短信
I just got a text from earl at Closets, Closets, Closets --

331
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,820
我知道那公司叫什么  老爸
I know what it's called, dad.

332
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,580
听听  "祝你下次好运  哈哈"
Listen to this -- "Better luck next time. Ha ha."

333
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,950
他总是知道说什么来激怒我
He always knows what to say to get my goat.

334
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,720
我在等木材供应商给我报价
I'm waiting for a quote from the lumber supplier,

335
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,640
可这次徒步要3个小时  手机会没信号
but this hike is three hours -- I'm gonna lose signal.

336
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,450
我们回去吧
Let's go back.

337
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,680
老爸  我们必须找个靠谱的借口
Dad, we can't just up and leave without a plausible reason wh--

338
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,830
克莱尔受伤了
Claire's hurt!

339
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,570
怎么了
What happened?

340
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,180
你知道她总是笨手笨脚的
Well, you know what a klutz she is.

341
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,210
亲爱的  你还好吧
Honey, are you okay?

342
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:00,990
不太好
Not really.

343
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,320
我来带她回营地吧
Yeah, well, I -- let me get her back to camp.

344
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,370
我们只会拖慢你们的速度
We're just gonna slow you down.

345
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,500
-来吧  乖女儿   -你们玩得开心
- Come on, sweetheart. -Yeah, you guys have fun.

346
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,720
他们是觉得我们有多白痴
How dumb do they think we are?

347
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,650
有时克莱尔会留给我食物的图片
Sometimes, claire leaves me pictures of food

348
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,250
而不是文字的购物清单
instead of a shopping list.

349
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,950
我好紧张
I'm so nervous.

350
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,830
我们真能看到穿泳装的休・杰克曼吗
Are we gonna see Hugh Jackman in a bathing suit?

351
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,730
我们要对穿泳装的休・杰克曼说什么呢
What do we say to hugh jackman in a bathing suit?

352
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,370
天啊  好"大"
Oh, my god. It's so big.

353
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,120
太直接了吧  不过他说不定会很开心
That's a bit direct, but, you know, he might be flattered.

354
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,640
原来你是在说那艘船
Oh, you're talking about the boat.

355
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,320
费格斯
Fergus!

356
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,260
费格斯
Fergus!

357
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,820
感谢上帝你们来了
Oh, guys. Thank god you're here.

358
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,600
我刚刚和休大吵了一架
Just had the worst fight with Hugh.

359
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,920
不是吧  怎么了
Oh, no. What happened?

360
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,870
我取笑《悲惨世界》里的罗素・克洛来着
I took a shot at Russell Crowe in "Les Mis."

361
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,990
结果休生气了
Hugh took offense.

362
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,250
他应该知道那角色
Oh, well, he has to know

363
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,240
-不该让罗素来演吧  -他必须知道
- Russell was horribly miscast. - He has to know.

364
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,020
绝对是选角失误
Horribly miscasted.

365
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,460
-不是他的错  -不是他的错
- It's not his fault. - It's not his fault.

366
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,720
他表演得还行  但是...
He was -- the acting was fine, but --

367
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,000
我们上船去把事情说清楚
Okay, let's get on this boat and fix this.

368
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,140
对  把一切说清楚
Yep. Fix it.Come on.

369
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,410
不是这条船
That's not the boat.

370
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,720
他们已经走了
They've already gone.

371
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,850
休穿着条暴露的泳裤站在甲板上
Hugh was standing on his deck in a skimpy, little bathing suit,

372
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,180
看起来很失望
disappointed look on his face.

373
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,610
慢着  我没听错吧  暴露的泳裤吗
Wait. I'm s-- wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Skimpy?

374
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,950
不好意思  站在他的什么上
I'm sorry -- standing on his what?

375
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,950
他的甲板上
On his deck.

376
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,950
[澳洲口音deck和dick"老二"发音相似]

377
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,010
船上的甲板  了解
Of the boat. Got it. Okay.

378
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,210
知道吗
You know what?

379
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,550
我们不需要他们
We don't need them.

380
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,180
我去雇条船  我们可以自己开派对
I'll hire a boat. We'll have our own party!

381
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,560
这才是生活  是吧
This is the life, eh, boys?

382
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,090
所以我们不是开这个去坐大船吗
Oh, s-- so we're not taking this to a bigger boat?

383
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,860
一条大船
A bigger boat!

384
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,080
来块鲜肉派吧
Have a meat pie.

385
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,350
不了  谢谢  不要
No, thank you. No.

386
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,820
不用  谢谢
No, thanks.

387
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,190
你还好吧  菲尔
Are you okay, Phil?

388
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,320
我没事
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

389
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,340
我只是希望克莱尔能在这里
I just wish Claire was here to see all this.

390
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,470
而且我的脚已经肿成两倍大了
Plus, my foot's twice its normal size,

391
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,080
蚊子还追着我被水母咬过的地方叮
and the mosquitoes are really going after my jellyfish bites.

392
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,510
看哪  一个征兆
Look! A sign!

393
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,360
什么
What?

394
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,530
你想看袋鼠  现在就看到了
You wanted to see a kangaroo, and now you see one.

395
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,490
我想这是你妈妈在告诉你

396
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,630
接下来旅途会变得很棒  菲尔
that the rest of the trip is going to be magical, Phil.

397
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,350
我妈就是这种人
That is so my mom,

398
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,290
用袋鼠来传递讯息
to say it with a kangaroo.

399
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,400
看
Look.

400

401
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,000
小心点  你会吓着它的
Okay, but be careful. You're gonna scare him.

402
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,620
亲  你好
G'day, mate.

403
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,600

不  这个
No, this one!

406
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,050
不  这个
No, this one!

407
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,170
我快喘不过气了
I can't breathe!

408
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,530
跟莉莉一起买东西绝对是最好的避孕措施
Shopping with Lily is the best birth control in the world.

409
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,470
没错
Yeah.

410
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,710
但你知道这没有实际效果的吧
But you know it's not, right?

411
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,080
这个
Ooh! This one!

412
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,380
感谢上帝  快点买吧
Thank god. Hurry up and buy it.

413
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,250
等等  如果之后我们碰到更好的怎么办
Wait. What if there's a better one later?

414
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,050
我们继续逛吧
Let's keep looking.

415
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,670
不不不  你就买这个
No, no, no! You are buying that.

416
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,890
你不可能找到更好的了
You're never gonna find anything better.

417
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,510
我就没找到更帅的救生员
I never found a hotter lifeguard, okay?

418
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,460
这个很完美  而且就在你面前
This is perfect, and it is right in front of you.

419
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,130
给  谢谢
Here. Thanks.

420
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,120
我很喜欢你的口音
I really love your accent.

421
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,130
谢谢
Wow. Thank you.

422
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,350
我要退掉这个
I would like to return this.

423
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:42,920
想什么呢
Penny for your thoughts?

424
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,120
咪咪
Boobs.

425
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,140
我也是
Me too!

426
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,330
我们到底怎么了
What's our problem?

427
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,190
那东西扑面而来的时候我就慌了
I freaked out when those things came at us.

428
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,330
我以为我能承受一个
I think I could've handled one,

429
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,800
但是它们一起来了
but they ganged up on me.

430
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,930
小伙子们
Hey, boys.

431
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,700
想不想参与一次
How would you like to participate

432
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,220
原住民徒步之旅
in an aboriginal walkabout?

433
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,760
不了  谢谢  你问问那些女孩吧
No, thanks. Why don't you ask those girls over there?

434
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,230
这次徒步只限男士参与
This walkabout's for men only.

435
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,840
相信我  我们算不上男士
Trust me -- we're not men.

436
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,560
看来你真的很需要这个经历
Sounds like you need this more than anyone.

437
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,810
快点  来吧
Quick -- come here.

438
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,510
真好  现在我们还化妆了
Perfect. Now we're wearing makeup.

439
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,790
你是在开玩笑吧
You have got to be kidding me.

440
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,590
我们可以走到丛林去吗
Okay, can we walk to the bush?

441
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,600
不行  调配中心会在1小时内派来新车
Nah. Dispatch is sending a cab in an hour.

442
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,740
-1小时  -搞什么
- An hour. - What?!

443
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,450
小卡  是我们活该
No, Cam, we deserve this.

444
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:22,010
我们抛弃了家庭  丢开了女儿
We deserted our family, we abandoned our daughter,

445
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,230
为了什么呢
and for what?

446
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,110
我们不仅是脑残粉
We're not just star you-know-what-ers.

447
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,530
而且还是大傻叉
We're you-know-what-holes!

448
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,300
你知道莉莉不在这儿你可以说脏话吧
You know Lily's not here, right?

449
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,080
我的天哪
Oh, my god.

450
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,160
[毒蛇  为活而骑行  为骑行而活]

451
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,560
镇定一点
Please be cool.

452
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,100
我一向很镇定
I'm always cool.

453
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,700
你们好
Hello!

454
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,420
鞋子不错啊
There's some pretty fancy shoes.

455
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,800
谢谢
Thank you...?

456
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,870
听我说  我们不想惹麻烦
So, listen, we don't want any trouble,

457
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,510
但是  我和我朋友
uh, but my -- my friend and I --

458
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,560
朋友  真的吗
"Friend"? Really?

459
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,660
是的
Yeah.

460
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,870
我们的车坏了
Our cab broke down,

461
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,910
我们要去找我们的女儿
and we are trying to get to our daughter --

462
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,850
我和我朋友共同的女儿
The daughter my friend and I have together.

463
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,320
这是不对的
Well, that ain't right.

464
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,010
爸爸们应该和女儿在一起
Daddies should be with their little girls.

465
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,440
说真的  这鞋子我能在哪买到
Seriously, where can I get a pair of them shoes?

466
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,470
他想要你的鞋  快给他
He wants your shoes. Give him your shoes.

467
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,270
什么  好吧
What? All right.

468
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,760
我不想要你的  我想要自己的
I don't want your shoes. I want to get me own.

469
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,800
他不想要你的鞋  快穿上
He doesn't want your shoes. Put your shoes on.

470
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,360
我就知道
I knew it!

471
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,400
歌洛莉亚  别生气
Gloria, don't be mad.

472
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,050
太迟了
Too late!

473
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:27,910
我知道这看起来很糟
I know this looks really bad,

474
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,820
但你必须要明白这是我
but you have to understand that this is my --

475
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,980
你的宝贝项目是吧  我知道
Your baby?! I know.

476
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,010
你们应该感到羞耻
And you should be ashamed of yourself!

477
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,620
你的丈夫正在进行精神之旅
You have a husband who is on a spiritual journey

478
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,530
还被袋鼠揍了一拳
and was punched by a kangaroo!

479
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,500
什么
What?!

480
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,130
歌洛莉亚
Gloria!

481
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,770
亲爱的  我刚听说
Honey, I just heard.

482
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,410
你怎么被袋鼠给打了呢
How did you get punched by a kangaroo?

483
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,480
很猛的一下
Really hard.

484
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,550
在脸上
In the face.

485
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,270
我很抱歉
Oh. I'm sorry.

486
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,430
天哪
Oh, boy.

487
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,820
我能帮你做点什么吗
Is there anything I can do?

488
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,200
你能别工作了陪我坐一下吗
Could you stop working and sit with me for a while?

489
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,720
-当然可以了  -谢谢
- Yes, of course I can. - Thank you.

490
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,220
好的  温柔点
Okay. Be -- be soft.

491
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,030
谢谢你  宝贝
Okay. Thank you. Aw, baby.

492
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,490
天哪  菲尔
Oh, my god. Phil.

493
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,710
亲爱的
Honey!

494
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,840
菲尔  一只野狗抢了我的电脑
Phil! A wild dog took my laptop!

495
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,840
1980年在澳洲曾有野狗叼走了一对夫妻的女婴
因女婴尸体从未找到  母亲曾被怀疑是凶手

496
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,750
看来它真的以为那是你的"宝贝"
Seems like a missed opportunity.

497
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,930
亲爱的  如果你想工作就直说吧
Honey, if you want to work, just say so.

498
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,950
不是  真的发生了  发生了
No! It happened! It just happened!

499
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,130
我什么也没看见
I didn't see anything.

500
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,760
我没看到你被袋鼠揍
I didn't see you get hit in the face by a kangaroo,

501
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,580
但我相信你了
but I believe you.

502
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,730
快点  帮我抢回来
Come on! Help me get it!

503
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,250
不  你自己去吧
No! You're on your own!

504
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,260
就像我独自旅行一样
Like I've been this whole trip!

505
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,280
我的天哪
For god's sakes!

506
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,150
歌洛莉亚  别走  听我解释
Gloria, stop! Let me explain!

507
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,130
好吧  但你最好别跟我解释说
Fine -- but the explanation better not be

508
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,580
这是个很重要的客户  而且你要赶进度
that this is an important account and you're on a deadline

509
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,800
什么什么什么的
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

510
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,400
好吧  那我需要一分钟想一想
Oh. Well, I'm gonna need a minute to think.

511
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,650
我丢下乔  漂洋过海
I did not leave Joe, fly across the world,

512
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,580
不是为了来看你工作的
to see you spend all your time working!

513
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,380
你这样完全不是在度假
You're missing the whole vacation!

514
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,380
你不是第一个这么说我的妻子
Not the first wife to tell me that.

515
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,950
那你还要多少个妻子说才能听进去
So how many wives need to say it before you listen?

516
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,790
那是怎么回事
What's that?

517
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,110
我不会告诉你的
I'm not gonna tell you.

518
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,760
要是你之前在这里的话  你就知道了
If you were here, you would know what that is.

519
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,960
我也不知道那是怎么回事
I don't know what that was.

520
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,810
但我就是不想让他得意
But I was not going to give him the satisfaction.

521
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:18,400
该死
Damn it!

522
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:22,560
为什么  澳大利亚  为什么
Why, Australia?! Why?!

523
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:24,080
你好  伙计
Hey, mate.

524
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,550
怎么样
How's...it going?!

525
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,790
一切都还好吗
Everything okay here?

526
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,880
不太好
Not really.

527
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,600
恕我直言   你看起来有点狼狈
You don't mind me saying, you look a bit beaten up.

528
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,550
是的
Yeah.

529
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,780
我爱你的祖国
I love your country,

530
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,740
但是你的祖国并不爱我
but your country doesn't love me back.

531
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,060
澳大利亚讨厌我
Australia's rejected me.

532
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,100
你看到这里没有
You see this right here?

533
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,440
这是鳄鱼咬的
That's from a croc bite.

534
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,400
我后背上这个
This one here on my back --

535
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,540
是我在墨尔本被煤车撞的
I was hit by a tram in Melbourne.

536
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,250
这里这个...
This right here --

537
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,380
这个痣不正常
That's an irregular mole.

538
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,490
得去好好检查一下
Should probably get that checked out.

539
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,860
我要说的是  澳大利亚对游客是友善的
Point is -- Australia is nice to tourists,

540
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,050
但她对自己的人民却是苛刻的
but it's tough on its own people.

541
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,140
恭喜你  伙计
Congratulations, mate.

542
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,220
你是我们的一员
You're one of us.

543
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,600
你说的和我想的是一样的吗
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

544
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:05,550
我想是的
I think I am.

545
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,260
我是鳄鱼・邓菲
I'm Crocodile Dunphy?

546
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,160
这...和我说的还真不沾边儿
That's...not what I was saying at all.

547
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,750
那是笑翠鸟吗  天生看不见东西的
Is that a kookaburra, which are born blind, or --

548
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,070
妈妈
Mom?

549
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,190
你在这里啊
There you are.

550
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,350
爸  笔记本丢了
Dad, the laptop is gone.

551
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,880
我们得马上回酒店
We've got to get back to the hotel right now.

552
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,820
我还清楚记得里面的内容
It's still fresh in my mind.

553
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,590
我想我能再把内容凑齐
I think I can just piece it together --

554
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,570
克莱尔
Claire.

555
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,330
随它去吧
Let it go.

556
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,950
什么  不行
What? No!

557
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,450
我倾注了我的心血在里面
I-I poured my heart into this.

558
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,240
难道你不想气一气厄尔吗
And don't you want to stick it to Earl?

559
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,400
都无所谓
Doesn't matter.

560
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,280
和你的家人在一起吧
Go be with your family.

561

还记得你小时候吗

然后我消失了好几天去工作

564
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,600
别和我一样
Don't be me.

565

我觉得我让你失望了
I feel like I'm letting you down.

566
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,700

00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,780
我总算有点时间和我女儿一起度假了

568

00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,920
那是什么
What is that?

570
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,940
莉莉  我们来了
Lily! We're here!

571

大爸二爸爱你

572
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,970
大爸二爸
Daddies!

573
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,290
我的天

那是我们的车  该走了

576
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,330
你是什么意思

577
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,640
-这些人是谁  -这个人是谁

578

亲爱的  真对不起

从现在开始  我只属于你

我发誓  不管你想干什么都行
I promise -- whatever you want to do.

581
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,920
菲尔  我当初想的可不是这个
Phil, this is not what I had in mind.

582
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,500
你做得很好  亲爱的
You're doing great, honey.

583
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:36,920
什么叫做桥梁
What is a bridge?

584
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,520
它是一条纽带  一座支架
It's a connecter, a supporter,

585
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,630
而有时候  它象征着爱  
and sometimes, it's a metaphor for the love --

586
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,660
-我的天  闭嘴  - 拜托
- Oh, my gosh! Stop!! - Come on!

由澳大利亚直飞洛杉矶的航班

593

抛开家人坐在这里让我有些愧疚
I feel a little guilty sitting up here without the family.

594
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,980
-我不觉得  -我也是

595

你不觉得这样有些过分吗
Don't you think it's a little rude

596
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,120
他们竟然坐在前面
that they're sitting up there?

597
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,600
我永远都不会那么做
I would never do that.

598
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,290
你度完假马上就恢复紧张状态了
Boy, you tense up fast after a vacation.

599
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,690
我发誓我看到休・杰克曼在前面

600
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,900
我们登机时我看到他了
I saw him when we boarded.

601
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,310
我觉得那个不是他
I don't think it's him.

602
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,610
好吧  我要去查个清楚
Oh, well, I'm gonna go find out.

603
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,280
小卡  不要  小卡  拜托
Cam, no. Cam, come on.

604
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,990
让他去吧  要不我们谁都甭想睡
Let him go, or none of us will get any sleep.

605
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,030
伙计们  我过来打个招呼
Hey, guys. Just saying hi.

606
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,640
不好意思
'scuse me.

607
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,720
我觉得这个人不是头等舱的
I don't think he belongs up here.
