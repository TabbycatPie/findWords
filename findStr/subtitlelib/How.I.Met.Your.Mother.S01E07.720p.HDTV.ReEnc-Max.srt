OLDER TED: Kids,
before I met your mother,

3
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:17,715
when I was still out there searching,
I learned something valuable.

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,405
That love is not a science.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,955
- Wow, that was a great story, Dad.
- SON: We're gonna go watch TV.

6
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,314
OLDER TED: You see, sometimes in life...

7
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,927
you just have to accept
that certain things can't be explained,

8
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:29,053
and that's kind of scary.

9
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:32,729
- Oh, my God.
- I know, I'm still shaking.

10
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:35,439
What the... Joke's on you. I have a cold.

11
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:36,809
Are you guys okay?

12
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:38,498
Another round,
and back it up for me and Lily!

13
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:39,678
What happened?

14
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:44,322
- We saw something, up in the apartment.
- Something bad.

15
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:47,582
(BOTH MOANING)

16
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:51,856
I don't know what it is,
but margaritas make me sexy.

17
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,524
<i>Oh, mucho sexy. Te
quiero,  Marshall.</i>

18
00:00:58,454 --> 00:01:00,364
Oh, my God!

(LILY SCREAMING)

20
00:01:04,096 --> 00:01:05,116
What was it?

21
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:08,272
Only the craziest, meanest-Iooking mouse
you've ever seen.

22
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:12,958
Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse.
That was a huge cockroach.

23
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:15,413
Baby, it was a mouse. It had whiskers.

24
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,408
What, those things coming out
of his head? Those were antennae.

25
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:21,978
- Marshall ran away from a cockroach.
- It was a mouse.

26
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:24,752
Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.

27
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:28,291
My story's on. Ted, pay attention.
Carl, turn it up.

28
00:01:28,386 --> 00:01:29,502
<i>I'm here with Ellen Pierce,</i>

29
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:31,796
<i>New York's premiere matchmaker.</i>

30
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:36,101
<i>Ellen, your company 'Love Solutions'
boasts a 100% success rate.</i>

31
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,713
<i>- What's your secret?
- Science.</i>

32
00:01:38,714 --> 00:01:42,731
Everything in life can be broken down
to ones and zeros, even love.

33
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:46,332
All I have to do is input
the variables, run the algorithm,

34
00:01:46,428 --> 00:01:50,158
and presto manifesto,
you have a soul mate and it works!

35
00:01:50,253 --> 00:01:53,241
Just ask all of my happy couples.

36
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:55,545
(WHISPERING) And these are just
the attractive ones.

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,158
I have more photos in the bathroom.

38
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:00,454
Love Solutions' Ellen Pierce.

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,939
A beacon of hope
for New York City's lovelorn.

<i>Robin Scherbatsky...</i>

41
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:05,650
Was that chick at the end really a client?

42
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:06,862
- Yes.
- We're signing up.

43
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,156
- What?
- Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot.

44
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:14,396
That's a perfect cocktail.
Shake well, then sleep with.

45
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,488
I'm not going to a matchmaker.
That's like giving up.

46
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:19,783
It's the man version of getting a cat.

47
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,577
No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur.
And only mammals have fur.

48
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:24,724
It was a cockroach.

49
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,987
Come on, Lily.
The only way that that was a cockroach...

50
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:31,036
is if it was wearing the skin
of a mouse it just killed.

51
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:33,042
Oh, my God!

52
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,879
Come on!

(MOUSE SQUEAKING)

55
00:02:45,794 --> 00:02:48,408
Ted! Hurry!
You got to help me, my boat is sinking.

56
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,683
- What?
- My boat is sinking!

57
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:51,182
- You have a boat?
- Yes, I bought a boat last year...

58
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:53,668
at a police auction. I just got a call
from a guy down at the marina...

59
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:55,166
that it's leaning starboard
at a 45-degree angle.

60
00:02:55,262 --> 00:03:00,267
If I don't get down there right now
it's gonna capsize! Now come on!

61
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:02,849
Your boat is sinking. That was good.

62
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:05,813
Come on.
Ted, this is an incredible opportunity.

63
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:11,025
We'll meet our soul mates, nail them,
and never call them again.

64
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:13,113
All finished, gentlemen?

65
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,173
Congratulations, you have just taken
your very first step.

66
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:19,234
Gosh, thanks, Ellen.
I sure hope this works.

67
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:24,015
I'm so done with the single life.
All the games, the meaningless sex.

68
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,021
You deserve more.

69
00:03:26,278 --> 00:03:28,538
That is so true, Ellen.

70
00:03:29,082 --> 00:03:33,928
I really think I'm ready to stop
being a me, and start being a we.

71
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,670
Hey, is there any way I can
let it be known that I love cuddling?

72
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:40,168
Oh, of course you... That is so...

73
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:45,532
It's kind of hard to talk about with Ted here,

74
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:50,345
but I just want someone who's not afraid
to hold me at night,

75
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,352
when the tears come.

76
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:55,732
Ellen, can you help me find her?

77
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:57,739
- Get out.
- What?

78
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:01,087
I get 15 guys like you every week.

79
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,255
Jerks who just wanna meet
vulnerable women,

80
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,264
nail them, and never call them again.

81
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,335
Oh, my God, people do that?

82
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,535
Do you wanna do this the easy way,
or the hard way?

83
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,786
What's the hard way?
Security roughs me up and tosses me out?

84
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,571
No, that's the easy way.

85
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:17,822
The hard way is that I stomp the crap
out of you myself.

86
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,329
- Okay, Ted, let's go.
- Not you. You stay.

87
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:23,656
You're cute.

88
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,142
You're an architect. Good career.

89
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,820
And you didn't use an obvious alias
on your application...

90
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:31,513
like your friend 'Jack Package.'

91
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:36,188
- It's pronounced Puh-kaj.
- Get out of here!

92
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,162
You, I can work with.

93
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:43,454
You give me three days,
and I will find the woman you will marry.

94
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:47,438
No, thanks.
I don't need an algorithm to meet women.

95
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:50,657
It's New York City.
You know, plenty of fish in the sea.

96
00:04:50,753 --> 00:04:53,132
Plenty of fish in the sea.

97
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,311
Yes, there's nine million people
in New York,

98
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:57,374
4.5 million women.

99
00:04:57,478 --> 00:04:59,838
Of course, you wanna meet somebody
roughly your own age,

100
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,878
let's say, plus-minus five years.

101
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:04,365
So if we take into account
the most recent census data,

102
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,264
that leaves us with 482,000.

103
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,675
But wait, 48% of those
are already in relationships,

104
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:13,513
and then you have to eliminate half
for intelligence, sense of humor...

105
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:14,629
and compatibility.

106
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,403
And then you have to take out
the ex-girlfriends, and the relatives...

107
00:05:17,498 --> 00:05:19,474
and, oh, we can't forget those lesbians.

108
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,058
And then that leaves us with eight women.

109
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,101
That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?

110
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:33,340
There are eight fish
in that big, blue ocean, Ted.

111
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:36,368
And if you feel confident
that you could reel one into your boat...

112
00:05:36,465 --> 00:05:38,819
without me, there's the door.

113
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:41,300
Do you take credit cards?

114
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,664
Okay, it's back.
And this time we got a good look.

115
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,406
Hey. Seriously,
you have to stop doing that!

116
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:52,344
It's bigger now. It's been feeding.

117
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,292
We were just upstairs watching TV.

118
00:05:56,387 --> 00:05:58,297
Oh, gosh.

119
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:00,847
(GASPS)

120
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,447
Okay. Let's do this.

121
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,246
(SCREAMING)...

122
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:17,777
(SHUSHING)

123
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:19,871
It's okay. It's over.

124
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:23,193
(EXCLAIMS)...

125
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,599
- So, did you get a good look at it?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:36,738
It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton,
like a roach.

127
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,389
But it had mouse-like characteristics.

128
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:41,970
Gray-brown tufts of fur, a tail.

129
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:45,233
So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?

130
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:48,600
It's a cockamouse.

131
00:06:50,298 --> 00:06:51,445
What?

132
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,314
It's some sort of mutant combination
of the two.

133
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,192
It's as if a cockroach and a mouse,
you know...

134
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:01,965
Did the horizontal, 10-legged,
inter-species cha-cha?

135
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,738
That's impossible.
That simply can't happen.

136
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,141
- But it can.
- And it has.

137
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:08,146
And it's pissed.

138
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:11,943
Dude, is everything okay?
You left the front door open.

139
00:07:12,038 --> 00:07:13,948
There was no time.

140
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:18,158
So, Love Solutions?
Did you meet the love of your life?

141
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:21,505
She said it'd take three days.
It's been five days.

142
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:22,557
Should I be worried?

143
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:25,872
Just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.

144
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,550
Did you just use my name as a verb?

145
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:30,813
Yeah, we do that behind your back.

146
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,662
Ted out. To overthink.

147
00:07:32,757 --> 00:07:34,669
Also see, Ted up.

148
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,412
Ted up, to overthink something
with disastrous results.

149
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:39,866
Sample sentence,
Billy Teded up when he tried to...

150
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:41,872
Okay. I get it.

151
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:45,413
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
Ted anything up, or out.

152
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,188
I should give it a few more days.

153
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:52,390
- Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.
- Ted. Hi.

154
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,860
I meant to call you.

155
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,124
The computer is still crunching
the numbers.

156
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,100
Busy as a bee, that little computer.

157
00:07:58,196 --> 00:07:59,693
You said it was gonna be three days.

158
00:07:59,789 --> 00:08:01,415
Did I? Three days.

159
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:02,467
- Really?
- Yeah.

160
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:05,431
When someone says you're gonna meet
the perfect woman in three days,

161
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,110
you kind of put that in your datebook. So.

162
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:11,838
How do I say this?
This is gonna be really hard.

163
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:16,157
Ted, there are absolutely no women
out there for you.

164
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,890
Actually, I got through that okay.

165
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:25,437
There are no women out there for me?
I thought you said there were eight.

166
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,828
I know. There's supposed to be.
I don't know where they are.

167
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:30,346
But I'm an architect.
And you said I'm cute.

168
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,610
- I'm a cute architect.
- How do you think I feel?

169
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:36,205
I have a 100% success rate.
That's my hook!

170
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,603
I could maybe find somebody for you
if you were gay.

171
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:40,165
- Well, I'm not.
- A little bi maybe?

172
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,171
No!

173
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:46,190
- You're messing with me, right?
- Come see for yourself.

174
00:08:46,285 --> 00:08:48,220
I cannot set you up...

175
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:52,182
unless you have a compatibility rating
of 7.0 or higher. And look.

176
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:54,985
5.4, 4.8, 5.6...

177
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:56,709
There's a 9.6 right there.

178
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:58,835
Don't touch the computer.

179
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:02,733
Yes. Sarah O'Brien.
I fixed her up six months ago.

180
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:05,124
She would've been
absolutely perfect for you.

181
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,152
Well, what about the guy you set her
up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?

182
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,033
- 8.5.
- So he sucks!

183
00:09:10,128 --> 00:09:13,864
No, 8.5 is an extremely good
match-up quotient.

184
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:17,832
Sure it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?

185
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:21,674
9.6 is off the charts.
But Sarah is matched up.

186
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,329
Ted, look. I have lunch. Please.

187
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:28,872
I promise we will find you somebody.
Don't lose hope.

There are new women turning 18
every day.

189
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:01,642
It's a whole new species. The cockamouse.

190
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:05,020
And it's the size of a potato.

191
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,338
So, what now, it's a cockapotatomouse?

192
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:14,169
Don't make it sound ridiculous.
It's a cockamouse!

193
00:10:14,264 --> 00:10:17,102
My God, this is incredible!
We're like the same person.

194

She wants to have two children.

Wow, Ted.
Sounds like you're her perfect woman.

197
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,360
And like the majestic seahorse,
it's hermaphroditic.

198
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:35,899
Obviously, the whole thing
is shrouded in mystery.

199
00:10:35,994 --> 00:10:38,224
For as much as we know
about the cockamouse,

200
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,030
there is still so much we don't know.

201
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:44,154
Well, we know that there is no such thing
as the cockamouse.

202
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,947
What we don't know
is what you guys have been smoking.

203
00:10:48,043 --> 00:10:50,115
So you really don't believe
in the cockamouse?

204
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,889
Well, I believe that you saw
something perfectly normal,

205
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:59,155
but you've exaggerated it in your mind,
you know, like the Loch Ness monster.

206
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:04,013
If by 'like the Loch Ness monster'
you mean 'totally exists and is awesome,'

207
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:07,361
then, yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.

208
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:10,452
Its diet is not unlike our own.
Grains, cereals,

209
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:13,226
- and it's awfully fond of cheese.
- Okay. This is getting weird.

210
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:14,723
The similarities go on and on.

211
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,326
She hates phonies.
I totally hate phonies, too.

212
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:21,067
She's a dermatologist. I have skin.

213
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,905
You want to be her boyfriend.
She already has a boyfriend.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,510
- It's uncanny.
- All right.

215
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,207
But it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right?

216
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:31,969
See what my 9.6 looks like in person,
as, you know, a frame of reference.

217
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:36,145
And if she thinks she can do
11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?

So, what are we doing today?

00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,538
Right, I have a kind of mole on my back.

224
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,674
It's probably nothing.
But I'm a cautious guy.

Do you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

It just felt like there could
be this weird connection between us.

- Only a little.

00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:39,775
If this thing is what you say it is,
it could be huge for my career.

329
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,336
Brace yourself, dude.
This is gonna blow your mind-hole.

330
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,721
You bastard.
I actually got excited about this.

331
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:51,726
- What?
- It's empty.

332
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:57,512
Wait, but if it's not here, that means...

333
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,823
Lily!

334
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,738
- Robin!
- What?

335
00:18:01,834 --> 00:18:03,744
(EXCLAIMING)...

336
00:18:04,032 --> 00:18:05,086
(MOUSE SQUEAKING)...

337
00:18:05,181 --> 00:18:09,865
- Oh, my God! It's real!
- No, is it? Do something!

338
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:17,134
No! What the hell was that?
You trying to get it drunk?

339
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,493
It was the only thing I could think of!

340
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:21,499
Lily! Thank God!

341
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,243
(ALL EXCLAIMING IN PANIC)

342
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:26,249
Lily, I love you!

343
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,602
Robin, open the window!

344
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:30,681
(SCREAMING)

345
00:18:30,905 --> 00:18:34,851
Please, for the love of God,
open the window!

346
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:36,994
(WINGS FLAPPING)

347
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:39,001
It can fly.

348
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,646
ALL: Wow.

349
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:46,748
Be free, mutant beast.
I'll miss this private war of ours.

350
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,533
I grew to admire your tenacious...

351
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,574
Holy mother of God! It's headed this way!

352
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:52,579
Close the window!

353
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:02,435
Hi, Ellen.

354
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:06,226
I think I want my money back.

355
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:11,010
I'm a failure. I'm all washed up.
I tried everything, Ted.

356
00:19:11,105 --> 00:19:14,771
I widened the search parameters,
I tweaked the program.

357
00:19:14,866 --> 00:19:18,660
Last night, I stood out on the street
for five hours...

358
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:22,262
showing your photo
to random pedestrians. No takers.

359
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,896
Although this transvestite hooker said
he/she would do you for half price...

360
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,522
because you kind of look
like John Cusack...

361
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:31,271
<i>and his/her favorite movie was
Say Anything...</i>

362
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:34,726
Come on, Ellen. I mean, a pint of
ice cream. Isn't that a bit cliché?

363
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,732
It's for the bourbon.

364
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:39,985
This isn't hopeless.
You're gonna find someone for me.

365
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,483
No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.

366
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:48,305
I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me.
I'm bright. I'm attractive.

367
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,154
You just gotta get back out there
and keep looking.

368
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,066
No. You're never gonna find anybody.

369
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:55,445
And every year, you're just getting
older and it's getting harder and harder.

370
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,348
You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be
up on that wall one of these days.

371
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,737
- No, you won't!
- Yes, I will!

372
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,730
- How do you know?
- I don't know, but I believe.

373
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:07,878
Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse
can find love in this crazy city,

374
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,631
then damn it, so can I!

375
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,636
You're losing me.

376
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:14,412
The point is,
something good's gonna happen to me.

377
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:19,928
I mean, maybe your computer will help,
maybe it won't, but it'll happen.

378
00:20:20,023 --> 00:20:23,943
- So I should keep looking?
- Of course you should.

379
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,288
And now, you're gonna do it for free.
