7
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,850
Previously, on "Arrow"...

8
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,590
You have but two choices-- ascend to the calling of Ra's Al Ghul,

9
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:08,670
or you will spend the rest of your days in a cage.

10
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,530
I love you.

11
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,890
Lance knows.

12
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,220
The whole city knows, Oliver.

13
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,620
Mr. Queen should be considered armed and highly dangerous.

15
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,220
Captain Lance...

16
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,570
I'm here to turn myself in.

17
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,070
What the hell are your men doing?

18
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,290
I told them to stand down.

19
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,260
Get down on the ground!

20
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,820
You've got the wrong guy. Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

21
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,170
I am.

22
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,880
To repeat, we're just getting word

24
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,930
from the authorities that Roy Harper,

25
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,490
a Glades resident with a long history of run-ins with the police,

27
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,350
has been identified as the vigilante known as the Arrow...

28
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,800
What the hell was that?

29
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:54,880
Probably just a power surge.

30
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,350
That wasn't a power surge. Check it out.

31
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,350
There were earlier reports implicating Oliver Queen,

32
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,850
now appear...

33
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,020
transported to SCPD by police caravan,

34
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,070
and should be arriving imminently.

35
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,260
We're now going live to the SCPD.

36
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,950
All right, let's go. Get him, come on.

37
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,900
All right, bring him, come on, come on.

38
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,910
Is it safe to assume you're calling off the manhunt for Queen?

39
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,390
No comment. Come on, bring him through.

40
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,950
You proud of yourself? Letting the kid take the fall?

41
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,230
I'm not going to let him do that.

42
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,550
Give me a pen and paper, I will sign a full confession.

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,060
Oliver, not another word. Uncuff him.

44
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,740
Sure, in 25 to life.

45
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,920
More like right now. Habeas writ.

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,690
The district attorney's office

47
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,720
won't be pursuing charges against Oliver Queen

48
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,770
while it's charging Roy Harper with the same crime.

49
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,110
Nice try. Five hours ago, Queen turned himself in.

50
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,840
He confessed!

51
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,720
To you, alone and uncorroborated.

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,440
And then the Arrow turned himself in.

53
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,950
Your so-called confession

54
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,850
is looking rather fabricated right about now.

55
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,630
That's just crap.

56
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,440
The D.A. is ordering Oliver to be released.

57
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,630
Are you the only one

58
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,180
who's allowed to put themselves above the law?

59
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,070
This isn't over.

60
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,280
What the hell are you doing?

61
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,580
I'm just making sure you both don't end up in prison.

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,500
What are you doing here?

63
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,020
Proofing the quarterly earnings report.

64
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,130
And finalizing the subsonic ionizer patent application,

65
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,900
and I'm trying to debug the sequential--

66
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,110
I mean, what are you doing here?

67
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,920
Oliver and Roy Harper are both in handcuffs.

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,950
I have a lot of work to do.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
And Oliver was released.

70
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,280
How do you know about Roy Harper?

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,470
Apart from it being plastered all over the television,

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,620
I'm able to put one and one together,

73
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,110
and I get that Oliver's sister's boyfriend

74
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,860
is obviously part of your team.

75
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,760
Obviously.

76
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,520
- You ok? - Yes.

77
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,460
How are you?

78
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,710
Pss, yeah.

79
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,730
Let's--let's not get into that.

80
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,500
I said "I love you,"

81
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,060
but it was like, heh, it was like with a lowercase "L,"

82
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,580
you know, not, so let's not make it a thing.

83
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,130
You know, you had just saved my life,

84
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,550
I had 6.2 billion nano-robots coursing through my epithalamus,

85
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,420
and my emotions were a little all over the place.

86
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,810
Well, I'll let you get back to work-slash-worry,

87
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,070
and...

88
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,030
keep a good thought for Roy.

89
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,610
OK.

90
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,370
What were you thinking,

91
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,450
Roy?

92
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,680
Tell me why.

93
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,380
Do you remember what I told you

94
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,710
when I found out you were the Arrow?

95
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,160
Yeah. You told me I saved your life.

96
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,150
Now I get to save yours.

97
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,430
I can't let you do that.

98
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,450
Oliver, ever since I found out

99
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,820
that I killed that cop,

100
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,880
I have been trying to make it right as Arsenal.

101
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,440
But maybe what I need to do is make it right as the Arrow.

102
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,500
- No, Roy... - I killed a police officer.

103
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,220
Mirakuru or not, I should be punished for that.

104
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,810
I should be in prison.

105
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,120
That won't bring the officer back.

106
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,430
This city still needs you.

107
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,410
It needs you more.

108
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,150
For the first time since I remember what I did...

109
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm OK.

110
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,980
You sure this place is safe?

111
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,910
Safe as I can manage.

112
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,490
Who's that?

113
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,060
Someone eager to repay a debt.

114
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,170
OK, but for how long?

115
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,500
Waller has men all over Hong Kong looking for us.

116
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,890
Even if we could make it out of the city,

117
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,080
there's nowhere we could run where Waller won't find us.

118
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,030
So, what are we going to do?

119
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,190
I'm going to find Waller first.

120
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,320
You're going to break into A.R.G.U.S. by yourself?

121
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,170
No.

122
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,660
He's going to walk in.

123
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,270
My passcard to the Field Office.

124
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,500
What do you want?

125
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,370
Setting Harper up as your patsy. I applaud the gamble--

126
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,830
I had nothing to do with Roy turning himself in...

127
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,800
But I will get him out.

128
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,070
And then what? Ra's won't stop

129
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,850
until you're wearing the demon's head ring on your hand.

130
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,850
It's not going to happen.

131
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,080
People are being murdered.

132
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,800
Your days as the Arrow are finished.

133
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,570
But of course, no one close to you has died.

134
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,610
Have you considered that leading the League of Assassins

135
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,600
might be a preferable outcome as to what alternatives

136
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,950
Ra's might devise?

137
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,320
I have a lot of work to do.

138
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,630
I'm going to break Roy out of prison.

139
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,790
Ironically, before turning to vigilantism,

140
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,660
Harper was a career criminal,

141
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,050
with an arrest record for breaking and entering,

142
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,680
petty theft, and grand larceny. Until recently--

143
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,850
Thea...

144
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,920
Please tell me it wasn't you that put him up to this.

145
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,650
Of course not, but I'm going to do

146
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,880
everything in my power to make it right.

147
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,430
- Are you OK? - I'm fine,

148
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,020
but we need to get Roy out of prison.

149
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,960
Well, it looks like we might have another problem

150
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,590
to add to our ever-growing list.

151
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,550
...multiple homicide at Starling National Bank.

152
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,270
Channel 52 has acquired surveillance footage of the incident...

154
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,200
Makes sense. As a bank-robbing meta-human,

155
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,230
why stay in Central City

156
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,150
when you have plenty of banks and no Arrow?

157
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,940
OK. OK, we need a plan

158
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,020
to extract Roy. In the meantime,

159
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,870
Felicity, call S.T.A.R. Labs,

160
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,860
see if they're tracking

161
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,260
any meta-humans that have left Central City.

162
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,140
SCPD. According to city records,

163
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,630
you got a basement down here.

164
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,160
You already have Roy Harper in custody.

165
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,580
Yeah, and I got a warrant that says

166
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,070
I can search that basement.

167
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,070
Sorry for the rush,

168
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,850
but I didn't want to give you a chance to turn that place

169
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,220
into a storage room again.

170
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Gentlemen.

171
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,320
Here you go. Break it down.

172
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,100
I got you now, you son of a bitch.

173
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,940
Oh, my Chinese is a little rusty,

174
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,260
but this looks like a crate from the north China sea.

175
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,650
You've spent some time there, right?

176
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,420
And this is my favorite.

177
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,020
You actually put those things on display?

178
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,470
Captain, we have fingerprint matches

179
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,450
for the latents we lifted off all this equipment.

180
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,530
Hold that thought.

181
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,090
What do you got?

182
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,010
We only got one match.

183
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,610
What is it?

184
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,420
- Roy Harper. - Roy...

185
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,590
Just...

186
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,280
Did you check the other computers?

187
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,180
Captain Lance, it's clear--

188
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,040
Shut up! Whatever line of crap you're thinking about giving me,

189
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,950
you just save it.

190
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,740
Smart as you all are,

191
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,460
you are bound to make a mistake eventually.

192
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,690
And I'm going to be there when it happens.

193
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,600
You wiped the entire place?

194
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,930
And moved some of your more sensitive trunk items.

195
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,830
You're welcome.

196
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,640
But you didn't wipe Roy's prints.

197
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
Oliver, Roy already confessed.

198
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,240
We didn't see any point in losing both of you.

199
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm not losing... Roy.

200
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,980
What about that meta-human that is out there killing people?

201
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,610
We need to grab my back-up weapons cache in the secondary layer.

202
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,930
You see those plainclothes?

203
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,690
Lance will have them follow you everywhere you go.

204
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,180
You try to nab even so much as a purse snatcher,

205
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:12,980
and they'll pounce.

206
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,150
Somebody needs to protect this city.

207
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,190
We are dealing with a meta-human.

208
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,930
Call Barry.

209
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,550
Oh, he can't help right now, mm-mmm.

210
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,080
He's got on a lot on his plate with Dr. Wells, I think.

211
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,820
It's really hard to keep up with him.

212
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,490
But...what if there's someone else that could help?

213
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,230
Oh, hey, Felicity, check this out.

214
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,000
I finally got the neural network online,

215
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,220
so when my brain tells the gauntlet to wave, and...

216
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,880
Sorry to hear about what's happening to you.

217
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,540
Uh, if there's anything I can do to help...

218
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,010
Well, actually, that's why we're here.

219
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,910
You know how I try to keep my work life

220
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,490
and my other work life separate.

221
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:53,150
I meant to tell you that. Did I tell you that?

222
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,830
- Well, there's a-- - There's a meta

223
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,130
in Starling City that's killing people.

224
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,640
- A meta, as in human? - Yeah.

225
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,090
So, obviously we need to catch

226
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,530
this plasma death thing guy.

227
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,280
Ugh, now I see

228
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,550
why Cisco gives them all names.

229
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,670
The police are all over Oliver,

230
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,510
so...we need you.

231
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,590
And you're ok with this?

232
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
We need your help.

233
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,840
So it's a team up. High-five!

234
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,040
- Don't shoot! - What the hell is going on?

235
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,590
They've been holding me here for weeks.

236
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,170
What, you don't trust me?

237
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,830
Look at him.

238
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,280
He's army, not A.R.G.U.S.

239
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,040
Oh, so you're saying this is General Shrieve?

240
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,540
He held me hostage.

241
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,570
Targeted you and the Yamashiros, for death.

242
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,720
Why would he do that?

243
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,240
The Alpha Omega.

244
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,220
Shrieve plans to unleash it on Hong Kong,

245
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,120
Claiming that the Triad mishandled

246
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,200
a bio weapon they never should have had.

247
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,310
That's insane.

248
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,240
Well, Shrieve seems to think that

249
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,570
China is a military and economic threat.

250
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,830
So he'd kill himself and his men

251
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,130
just to hurt China?

252
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,270
His team has developed a vaccine

253
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,690
they can inoculate themselves with.

254
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,010
Run.

255
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,260
Get as far away from Hong Kong as you can.

256
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,730
If you make it...

257
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,030
I hope we meet again someday.

258
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,630
Now go!

259
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,990
How are you?

260
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,260
I told the guards I didn't want to see you.

261
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,250
Why?

262
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,270
Roy, please.

263
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,110
Tell me what is going on.

264
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,940
When we got back together,

265
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,040
hell, even before that, I...

266
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,280
I made a promise to myself

267
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,950
that I would never lie to you again.

268
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,250
Ok.

269
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,520
That's why I didn't want to see you.

270
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,230
I don't want to break that promise.

271
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,040
Why would you?

272
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,200
- Roy! - Thea...

273
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,470
Thea, please just...

274
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,300
know that I'm going to be fine.

275
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,390
Is that a lie?

276
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,230
Thea, don't worry.

277
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,100
Roy's not going to be in there much longer.

278
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,750
I'm working on it.

279
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,670
Bye.

280
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,530
- Roy holding up? - For now.

281
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,090
Hot off the presses.

282
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,370
What are those?

283
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,390
I visited the bank today.

284
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,000
Uh, manager's a friend of mine.

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,330
I beat him at squash every Tuesday.

286
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,390
And I took a few photos of the crime scene.

287
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,190
Actually, "Photos" is a bit reductive.

288
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,450
These are enhanced resonance scans.

289
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,450
It occurred to me that if we can't see his face

290
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:01,610
because of the radiation,

291
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,600
we need to remove the radiation.

292
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,340
Oh, I could kiss you right now. Awkward, sorry.

293
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,430
Boundaries. We're working on it.

294
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,140
So, if we interlace the resonant scan's frequency

295
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,200
with our news footage, we get this.

296
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,070
- There he is. - Run a facial recognition.

297
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,960
Way ahead of you. Jake Simmons.

298
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,150
He's already in the system.

299
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,620
Serial bank robber, which explains Starling National.

300
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,100
Last known address,

301
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,000
- Central City. - Where is he now?

302
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,140
He was last seen on a traffic camera

303
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,800
at the corner of Gantner and Yount.

304
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,790
There's a processing plant there;

305
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,760
- He went in, never came out. - On it.

306
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

307
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,900
I thought the whole point of this team-up

308
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,470
was you not being spotted out as a vigilante.

309
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,760
Stop calling it a team-up, Ray.

310
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,030
This Jake Simmons is not just a meta-human,

311
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,680
he is a killer. And you're not ready for that.

312
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,550
Look, I'm-- I'm not going to try to equate our experiences,

313
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,870
but superpowers are based in science,

314
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,740
and I am a man of science.

315
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,840
So if there's any way to defeat this guy,

316
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,530
I'm the one who's best able to figure it out.

317
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,480
Fine.

318
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,630
The second that you get in over your head...

319
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,790
I'll run.

320
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,530
Fly, probably.

321
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,580
How many abandoned warehouses do you think are in this city?

322
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,530
No, no, I'm -- I'm genuinely curious.

323
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,720
Stay focused, Ray.

324
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,290
Maybe Simmons isn't in there.

325
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,550
Do you get this anxious when I'm out in the field?

326
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,010
I honestly can't think of an answer to that question

327
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,420
that doesn't get me in trouble.

328
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,830
Still nothing.

329
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,870
Not a visual sighting or any other reading at all from the ATOM.

330
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,920
And when I say ATOM, I mean the suit,

331
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,210
not myself in the third person.

332
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,960
There's a decent chance that you and Palmer are related.

333
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,980
Well, that's equally fascinating

334
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,490
and terrifying.

335
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,790
Be my eyes, Ray, what's going on?

336
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,950
Oh, tin man? You shouldn't be here.

337
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,070
Actually, I should. See, you're the bad guy,

338
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,150
and I am--

339
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,350
Ray?!

340
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,090
Thanks for the top off.

341
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,130
Ray!

342
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,030
Ray, ray!

343
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,050
Oh, my God, ray, are you hurt?

344
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,850
Heh, "Hurt" would be a step or two up

345
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,050
from how I feel right now.

346
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,340
But... just a second.

347
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,060
You're lucky to have gotten out of there alive.

348
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,910
It wasn't that bad, was it?

349
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,330
It was way worse, Ray.

350
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,270
Right. I need shields!

351
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,490
That's not the answer. You need to anticipate your opponent.

352
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,100
You need to trust your instincts

353
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,370
and not just your tech.

354
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,010
My instinct is to trust my tech.

355
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:23,290
Ray, when I'm out in the field, my bow, my arrows,

356
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,070
those are just tools.

357
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,630
- I'm the weapon. - That's poetic.

358
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,780
My point is that if you rely on that suit

359
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,750
more than you rely on yourself...

360
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,570
it's going to get you killed.

361
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,480
So when is Shrieve going to distribute the virus?

362
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,100
- I don't know. - If he's going to pin it on the Triad, though,

363
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,170
he'll have to do it soon.

364
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,500
We need to get out of Hong Kong.

365
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,930
My contact says Shrieve has men everywhere,

366
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,260
with even more resources at his disposal than Waller ever had.

367
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,820
Shrieve has assured we won't get off this island alive.

368
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,160
Well, if we can't run, Waller said

369
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,370
Shrieve had a vaccine for the virus.

370
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,210
You want to steal some of the vaccine?

371
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,390
He has to have it somewhere in Hong Kong.

372
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,310
Get down!

373
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,320
Let's see how good you are without your arrows.

374
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,860
Good enough.

375
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,630
Just remember... that was without arrows.

376
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,220
Get down, on the floor!

377
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,770
All right, turn this place inside out.

378
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,270
We know how this guy loves his secret hiding places.

379
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,270
Hey, Frank.

380
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,680
What brings you out of your downtown office?

381
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,670
The chief of D's asked me to have a word with you.

382
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,300
Yeah? What about?

383
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,570
He wants to know why you're still going ahab

384
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,900
on Oliver Queen when we got

385
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,540
a different suspect already in custody.

386
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,800
We got a patsy in custody.

387
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,280
Trust me, Queen is our guy.

388
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,260
Well, there's no evidence against Queen.

389
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,770
Why do you think I'm searching his condo?

390
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,020
Friend to friend...

391
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,800
You've come so far. You're a Captain.

392
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,430
Don't throw all your hard work away on something personal.

393
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,120
Look, I don't know what it is

394
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,460
you think that you're going to find,

395
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,230
but it's not here. There's nothing here!

396
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,270
Kind of like how there was nothing in the basement of your club?

397
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,120
You're either complicit

398
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,110
or just about the most naive girl I ever met.

399
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,610
You know that your brother is letting your boyfriend

400
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,130
rot in prison for his crimes, right?

401
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,390
Get out of my home.

402
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,350
I know you went to visit Harper yesterday.

403
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,690
Does he even know why he's throwing his life away?

404
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,850
Lance.

405
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,710
Is he all right?

406
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,450
All right, I'll be right there.

407
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,330
Your boyfriend was just attacked.

408
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,860
He's all right, but I can't imagine it'll be the last time.

409
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,760
Your brother dropped a lot of bodies.

410
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,990
And when, and it's not if,

411
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,560
it is when Roy gets a shiv in the back,

412
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,680
that body will be on him, too.

413
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,250
The suit recorded over ten terabytes of data,

414
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,110
which were uploaded in real time

415
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,420
to a geosynchronous satellite.

416
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,650
That is a huge energy suck.

417
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,810
This is all fascinating.

418
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,220
- How do we find Simmons? - Light bulb, literally.

419
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,060
I--no, actually, figuratively.

420
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,440
Uh, just before Simmons beat me,

421
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,710
I blasted him with my compressed light beams,

422
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:28,110
and he thanked me for topping him off.

423
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,320
He absorbs energy and turns it into weaponized plasma.

424
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,310
And if we can manually get into the city's power grid,

425
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,800
we might be able to track where he's getting his extra juice.

426
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,820
Ollie!

427
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,020
What's going on?

428
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,030
It's Roy!

429
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,430
He was attacked by a bunch of inmates.

430
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,070
He's fine, but there's hundreds of them in there!

431
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,820
I'm going to break him out.

432
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,920
Oliver. You can end up in a cell right next to him.

433
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,480
John, if you know what's good for you,

434
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,750
you'll get out of my way.

435
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,410
Oliver, if you know what's good for you,

436
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,670
and for Roy-- you're going to need to stay put.

437
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,070
- I can't do that. - Oliver, listen...

438
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,170
Get your hands off of me!

439
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,090
Listen, I know what you're going through, man!

440
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,230
You have to rely on Palmer to take care of this meta

441
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,900
while Roy sits in a prison.

442
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,540
But listen to me, man, you have to throttle this back,

443
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,120
Oliver. You have to.

444
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,540
Before you lose everything.

445
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,310
I've already lost everything.

446
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,690
I'm not going to lose Roy.

448
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,520
Oliver!

449
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,720
I can't believe that you and Diggle are ok

450
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,010
just sitting on your hands while Roy fights off

451
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,250
- all of Iron Heights! - It is not that simple!

452
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,720
No, Felicity, if anything was ever simple,

453
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,470
it's this.

454
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,500
Then what? You're going to jail, too?

455
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,580
I can't just do nothing.

456
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,590
I think John's right.

457
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,840
I think you're struggling with doing nothing

458
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,110
with Roy, with Ray, but right now,

459
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,820
you need people to help you. You need to let them.

460
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,970
Maybe...there is something more

461
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,410
going on with you than just what's happening with Roy

462
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,030
and this meta-human.

463
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,780
You have sacrificed everything to be the Arrow.

464
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,900
Even you and me.

465
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,750
But...

466
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,420
whether or not you break Roy out of Iron Heights,

467
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,420
there is no more Arrow.

468
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,260
Ra's took that from you.

469
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,370
I was told once that a man

470
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,450
cannot live by two names.

471
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,560
Well, right now,

472
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,990
I can't live by either.

473
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,910
So I don't know who I am.

474
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,540
I know who you are.

475
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,880
Whether you're in a... in a suit

476
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,370
or under a hood, you're the man that I...

477
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,610
you're the man that I believe in.

478
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,200
Ray finished the transponder.

479
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,560
I have to upload it to a power source

480
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,710
and, hopefully it'll bring us right to Simmons.

481
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,680
- I'll go with you. - It is adorable

482
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,880
how you keep forgetting that Lance is after you,

483
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,680
but, it's a quick errand

484
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,180
and you need practice in letting people help you.

485
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,730
You sure this is it?

486
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,990
It doesn't look like a typical army base.

487
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,720
Matthew Shrieve isn't a typical army general, apparently.

488
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:56,980
Quiet!

489
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,980
Where's the vaccine?

490
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,720
You can end up unconscious

491
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,450
or you can end up dead.

492
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,480
Two lefts,

493
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,110
second door on your right.

494
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,770
Good choice.

495
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,640
Somebody coming.

496
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:22,030
10 seconds.

497
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,810
Up there.

498
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,400
Thank you.

499
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,580
Can you give us a minute?

500
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,350
I already signed my confession.

501
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,810
Yeah, it's a hell of a story.

502
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:48,290
All that stuff about setting up shop

503
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,750
under your girlfriend's club.

504
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,210
And I particularly like how you managed not to implicate her.

505
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,330
What are you doing here?

506
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,230
You remember that,

507
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,620
that corpse I showed you?

508
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,010
The one that the Arrow killed?

509
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,260
I knew you had an obsession with the Arrow.

510
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,720
And, I was trying to wave you off

511
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,030
'cause I knew, just somehow I knew,

512
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,800
that if you stayed obsessed with him,

513
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,610
that you would come to a bad end.

514
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,640
And here I am.

515
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,150
Two years later, I'm still trying to save you, son.

516
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,460
I don't need saving.

517
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,680
Look, I know you got to be doing

518
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,930
this 'cause you think you owe Queen something.

519
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,810
But you don't. You don't deserve to be here.

520
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,710
Patrol Officer Gabe Vincent

521
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,160
left behind a wife and a nine-year-old boy.

522
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,430
I know.

523
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,290
I killed him.

524
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,070
I stabbed him in the chest with an arrow.

525
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,190
So don't think for a second that I don't deserve to be here.

526
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,040
No. You don't think for a second

527
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,810
that what you're doing here

528
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,350
makes up for any of what you did out there.

529
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,060
Guard.

530
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,160
We have take off.

531
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm sorry, miss,

532
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,540
but I don't think you're supposed to be here.

533
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,140
I'm supposed to access your grid for the city.

534
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,280
Think you can help?

535
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,510
Sure. It's this way.

536
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,340
Thank you.

537
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,200
So,

538
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,170
what's with the sunglasses, man?

539
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,810
We're indoors and it's, well, night.

540
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,230
- Do you have a sensitivity to the... -To light?

541
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,730
No.

542
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,000
I love the light.

544
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,410
Do you think the plan to find Simmons will work?

545
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,540
Well, it's Felicity, so, yes.

547
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,250
Except the tracking firmware seems to be malfunctioning.

548
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:06,790
What?

549
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,410
It's not a malfunction.

550
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,850
It's Simmons. He's drawing energy

551
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,820
- directly from a power station. - Which one?

552
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,360
The one Felicity just went to.

553
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,690
Come on, Felicity, pick up.

554
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:19,260
I'm sorry, but the blonde can't come to the phone at the moment.

555
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,440
I swear to God, if you hurt her...

556
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,220
You'll what... fly away again?

557
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,230
I am talking to the man in the suit,

558
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,020
right? The one who thinks a piece of scrap metal

559
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,120
makes him some kind of hero?

560
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,740
It doesn't.

561
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,800
I am sorry for the interruption.

562
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,710
Where were we?

563
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,670
Waiting for you to come closer.

564
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,610
- Oliver, you can't go out there. - It's Felicity!

565
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:53,950
Oliver, you won't make it in time.

566
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,240
Power station is still eight minutes away

567
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,660
going 60 on the Ducati.

568
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,640
But the Atom? Well, the Atom can fly.

569
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,580
You need more than your tech this time!

570
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
You're right.

571
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,230
My tech and your instinct,

572
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,770
maybe there's a way we can get him.

574
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,190
Ok, I'm entering the power station now.

575
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,450
Activate the link.

576
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,360
It's working! Oh, I'm just a passenger now.

577
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,770
Ooh. Let's get this guy.

578
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,890
Sorry.

579
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,190
But I have to kill you now.

580
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,810
No, and you're going to leave her the hell alone.

581
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,710
Kick his ass.

582
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,500
You ok?

583
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,310
You got to get out of here!

584
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,150
No! I'm not going to leave you here alone.

585
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,120
Ray, get her out of there!

586
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,310
I'm not alone, but I can't fight him

587
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,820
and worry about you, now, go, Felicity!

588
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,220
- No! - Felicity, go!

589
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,200
Get out of here!

590
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,590
I'm really hoping you played video games as a kid.

591
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,180
- I'm trying to concentrate. - Sorry, sorry,

592
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,920
It's just, I'm trusting you with my--

593
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,890
Ray, can you take this beating? I can pull you back.

594
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,490
I'm fine. Get this bastard!

596
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:27,940
Ray, I've lost control.

597
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,180
The transmitter's been severed.

598
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,610
Get up.

599
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,630
Get up, Ray!

600
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,730
Fight back, Ray, fight back! Ray!

601
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,520
He's too strong!

602
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,200
This is not about strength.

603
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,130
This is about heart.

604
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,200
When the mayor was killed,

605
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,380
you put yourself in harm's way to save Felicity.

606
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,030
Normal people, they don't do that.

607
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,310
Heroes do that.

608
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,160
Come on, Ray!

609
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,360
Take him out, Ray.

610
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,940
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry!

611
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,660
No, it was totally worth it.

612
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,060
Are you ok? I was so worried.

613
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,820
I'm fine. Everything's ok now.

614
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,600
Eyes front, Harper.

615
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,160
I told you, eyes front.

616
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,120
My instincts are to keep my head on a swivel.

617
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,240
Won't happen again.

618
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,500
No, it won't.

619
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,250
Thea?

620
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,070
It's Roy.

621
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,850
Harper was killed an hour ago.

622
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,650
I'd say I'm sorry, but I think we both know

623
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:45,220
whose fault this is.

624
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,790
I shouldn't have listened to either of you.

625
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,040
I might not have been able to save Roy...

626
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,420
but I'd feel better right now if I tried.

627
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,540
We know that, Oliver.

628
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,630
We also know you may never forgive us.

629
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,270
I make my own choices, John.

630
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,950
I made this one.

631
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,880
He doesn't mean forgive us for that.

632
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,700
He means...

633
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,500
forgive us for this.

634
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,930
How?

635
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,030
Don't be mad at them. This was my idea.

636
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,670
If any one of us were in there and Oliver was here,

637
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,810
- He would think of something. - You're right.

638
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,920
If one of us deserves to go to prison, it's me.

639
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,430
Roy, we can't allow you to do that.

640
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,380
There's no way in hell Oliver's going along with it.

641
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,150
That's why you're not going to tell him.

642
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:33,260
You could have gotten yourself killed for real.

643
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,600
I figured that I could hold off

644
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,130
until Dig's guys got into position.

645
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,020
One of Lyla's contacts,

646
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,700
an A.R.G.U.S. freelancer.

647
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,140
Has a special talent for knifing people in just the right way.

648
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,810
Leaves a convincing amount of blood without the kill.

649
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,860
He laces the blade with a beta blocker, crawl the heartbeat.

650
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,320
Gives the illusion of death.

651
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,660
Everyone thinks the Arrow is dead.

652
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,250
Which means Oliver Queen is innocent.

653
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,170
You did all this without asking.

654
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,810
How many times have you saved one of us without asking?

655
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,110
This time we had to save you.

656
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,280
If everyone thinks you're dead...

657
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,390
then what happens to Roy Harper?

658
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,550
Tell Thea, well, tell her I'm alive, first.

659
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,180
Then tell her that

660
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,640
I'm sorry I had to leave without saying good-bye.

661
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,000
I feel like you're throwing your life away.

662
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,960
I'm not.

663
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,180
I'm starting a new one.

664
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,090
Anywhere, any time.

665
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,040
You need something, you call me.

666
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,450
Take care of yourself, Roy.

667
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,540
I'll miss you most of all, scarecrow.

668
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,560
Just be ready to get a million calls

669
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,680
on that untraceable satellite phone

670
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,130
I stuffed in your bag.

671
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,840
Thank you.

672
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,190
Thank you.

673
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,320
So, on a scale of one to ten,

674
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,990
how... mad at us are you?

675
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,880
I need to learn to let people help me.

676
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,280
You could use the practice in that.

677
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,760
I just think sometimes you're so focused

678
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:51,450
on people you love, you forget...

679
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,440
to see that there are people who love you.

680
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,060
Just enough inoculant for us.

681
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,870
And Akio.

682
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,630
What about her?

683
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,850
We need to inject Akio and ourselves

684
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:43,510
and then the three of you need to get somewhere safe.

685
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,740
And what about you?

686
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,420
I lifted this when I took the vaccine.

687
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,340
And clearly, it belongs to one of Shrieve's men,

688
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,360
because it has the plans

689
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,460
for how they are going to distribute the virus.

690
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,380
I'm going to use it to stop them.

691
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,050
No. You won't.

692
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,860
- We are. - Tatsu!

693
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,970
What example are we setting for our son

694
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,850
if we have a hope to save millions of innocent people,

695
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,490
- but only save ourselves? - Listen to me--

696
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,810
The two of you need to take care of Akio.

697
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,290
I am not going to be responsible--

698
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,710
You need to learn to let people help you.

699
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,100
And Maseo and I are going to.

700
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:21,250
What about...

701
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,400
Deathbolt.

702
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,970
Nice!

703
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,000
You know, you're the only other person

704
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,320
who's good at the names.

705
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,480
So, how do they get fed?

706
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:35,260
And, you know, complete the transaction,

707
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,230
so to speak?

708
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:38,840
Cisco?

709
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,570
You said Simmons is from Central City, right?

710
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,820
Yeah. Last known address,

711
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,820
4160 Dixie Canyon. Why?

712
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,980
According to this, Jake Simmons was a guest

713
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,740
of the Opal City Police Department on December 11th, 2013.

714
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,070
What do I know that date from?

715
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,850
That was the date of the particle accelerator test.

716
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,980
But if Simmons wasn't in Central City

717
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,520
the night of the dark matter explosion, then...

718
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,290
how can he be a meta-human?

719
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,680
Do you know who I am, child?

720
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,460
You're the demon.

721
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,520
I am the demon's head.

722
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,640
As those were before me,

723
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,750
and very soon, your brother.

724
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,130
He will never take your place.

725
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,090
He will.

726
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,360
Once I've given him sufficient motivation.

727
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,870
Oh, my brother's going to kill you!

728
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,490
No.

729
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,700
He's going to beg me.
