it sounds really wacko...

178
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,399
- Mm-hmm.

179
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,400
nothing seems impossible
now that

180
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:15,901
we have meta-humans,
right?

181
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,269

really my thing.

It's Cisco.
It's about Professor Stein.

Okay, go.
I'll cover you with Singh.

All right, thanks.

217
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,839
Well, I must admit,
I never imagined

218
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,042
the Sphinx's riddle about a man
requiring three legs

219
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:31,310
would ever apply to me,

220
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:33,879
but if this device
keeps me mobile,

221
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,447
then I will gratefully oblige.

222
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:38,350
Hopefully, you won't need it
for much longer.

223
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,452
There was no agglutination
in the blood samples,

224
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:42,321
and cross-matching
was negative for both,

225
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:43,822
and it appears that
the dark matter

226
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,424

explosion

227
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:47,259

in a very similar way

228
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:48,727
it did to yours.

229
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,762
I think they're both
potential matches.

230
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,997
So who do we go with?

231
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,199
Well, my first choice
is Henry Hewitt.

232
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,436
He graduated summa cum laude
from Hudson University

233
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,071
with a double major
in Applied Physics

234
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:00,305
and Bioengineering.

235
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,974
A Hudson boy,
I like him already.

236
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,710
Now, what about this other guy
Jefferson Jackson?

237
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:07,146
High school quarterback,
4.0 student.

238
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,815
He's got the physical
attributes.

239
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,885
And it looks like more of his
alleles match than Hewitt's.

240
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,254
Doesn't that mean
that he's more compatible?

241
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:18,590
On paper, perhaps,
but Hewitt is a scientist.

242
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:21,160
Clearly, he's trying to make
something of his life.

243
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,629
I think he'd be open
to something like this.

244
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,796
I think we should meet
with both of them

245
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:25,898
before we make a decision.

246
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,232
That's an excellent idea.

247
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,800
I'll see if I can
get Hewitt here.

248
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,235
All right, in the meantime,

249
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,436
we'll go meet with
Jefferson Jackson.

250
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:33,071
And I will try to find
something else

251
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,741
