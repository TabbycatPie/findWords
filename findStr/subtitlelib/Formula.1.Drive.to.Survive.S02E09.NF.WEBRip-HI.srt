1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,120
- [kisses] Say "love you."
- Love you.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,420
Bye.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,980
[in sing-song voice] Silverstone...

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,740
I love Silverstone. I just love it.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,260
<i>I think there's something incredibly
spiritual almost about Silverstone.</i>

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,960
<i>It really holds a very special place
in my heart.</i>

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,060
I want to have my ashes
spread at Silverstone.

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,280
You know that, don't you?

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,600
[Jonathan] I do now.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,416
- I thought I told you.
- [Jonathan chuckles] No.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,440
[both laughing]

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,120
I think Dad does as well.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,060
<i>Over my childhood,
I really understood how famous my dad was,</i>

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,560
<i>and how big Williams was.</i>

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,760
<i>It's just been the venue of so many
historic moments for our team.</i>

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,880
<i>That was our heyday.</i>

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,800
[crowd cheering]

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,380
<i>Dad's always been my hero.</i>

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,640
Dad's got two laps to try
and convince you to come to Williams.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,780
[all laughing]

21
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,900
[Claire] <i>He is Williams.</i>

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,340
I don't wanna disgrace the Williams name.

23
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,740
I don't want Williams to fall apart
under my watch.

24
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,920
<i>We have a fighting spirit,
and it's really being put to the test,</i>

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,960
<i>but I can tell you it's 100% back.</i>

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,520
Ladies and gentlemen, please put it
together for Claire Williams.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,380
[crowd cheering]

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,800
[indistinct chatter]

29
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,480
- That's like it. You got that?
- [man] I did.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,060
Lovely. Thrilled to bits.

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,240
- [kisses]
- You're the best.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,576
- [Frank] Bless you, Clairy.
- [Claire] See you later.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,620
- Silverstone.
- [Claire] Yeah.

34
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,620
<i>I'm deputy team principal,</i>

35
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,240
<i>which has really turned into
de facto team principal.</i>

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,320
<i>My dad's taken a step back
in the past few years,</i>

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,520
<i>and so really, I operate
as the team principal.</i>

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,060
Morning, Gwen. How are you doing?

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,720
<i>I'm responsible for making sure</i>

40
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,820
<i>that we've got the right people
in the right jobs,</i>

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,000
<i>with the right equipment to do those jobs.</i>

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,620
<i>And to make sure that this is a great
environment for people to work in.</i>

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,480
<i>I'm very protective over it.</i>

44
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,680
<i>Obviously, it's very close to my heart.</i>

45
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,696
I'm sorry I didn't make it down.
It was a busy day yesterday.

46
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,700
Was it? I was looking forward
to you coming down. [chuckles]

47
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,320
[Claire] <i>Williams is
in a very difficult place at the moment.</i>

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
Last year was pretty horrific.

49
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,580
<i>We just got it wrong.</i>

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,180
<i>We designed a bad race car.</i>

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,360
<i>And we've gotta fix it.</i>

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,420
[man] Jack. Okay?

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,220
- That was all of it.
- It's not your lunchbreak, as usual.

54
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,016
- Jeremy settle down.
- [Jeremy] No, it's not.

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,576
[Paddy] I actually found you
doing some work.

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,220
[Jeremy and man] Whoa!

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,620
[Jeremy] Straight in there, on Netflix.

58
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,660
[Paddy chuckles]

59
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,116
- [Jeremy] Thank you, Paddy.
- [Paddy chuckles]

60
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,940
[man] It's gonna be
Paddy's comedy special.

61
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
[Jeremy] Yeah.

62
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,600
My name is Paddy Lowe.

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,180
I'm Chief Technical Officer
for Rokit Williams Racing.

64
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
[Jeremy] There's no pressure
when Paddy is looking.

65
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,880
One of the biggest challenges is the one
that we face at the moment,

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,660
which is to take Williams back
to the front of the grid,

67
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,760
<i>where they have been in the past.</i>

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,660
We brought Paddy in from his
extraordinary successor, Mercedes.

69
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,100
<i>Trying to breathe new life into Williams.</i>

70
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,180
Rear is all ready to go.

71
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,200
- Pretty much.
- [man] Pretty close, yeah.

72
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,720
Paddy was the one who came up
with active suspension at Williams,

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,940
back in the 1980s.

74
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,060
He was the tech genius

75
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,780
<i>that was responsible for so much
of Williams' glory years.</i>

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,900
[Paddy] <i>Those days, a garage was quite
an oil-stained, concrete sort of place.</i>

77
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,640
<i>Now, very flash places with glossy floors
and sophisticated equipment.</i>

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,900
<i>So, a very, very different world.</i>

79
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Thank you.

80
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,280
[Claire] <i>He's an incredibly clever
individual,</i>

81
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,620
<i>and he has really stripped
everything back to basics.</i>

82
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,280
[Paddy] <i>We made a lot of changes
to how we developed the car.</i>

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,180
Changes within the team,
changes within our technical approach.

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,940
So, we're optimistic that we've made
some good improvements.

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,880
[man] We are just connecting
the ERS pack up,

86
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,120
getting ready to fire up
the FW42 for the first time.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,900
We're positive about this car,

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,660
but I was last year as well,
so hopefully, we've learnt.

89
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
[engineer] Okay.

90
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,880
[Paddy] <i>I wanna see a feeling
within the team...</i>

91
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,700
<i>that the team has turned a corner
and moved forwards...</i>

92
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,380
<i>and capable of winning championships
in the future.</i>

93
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,080
[drilling]

94
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,620
[drilling continues]

95
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,060
- [Paddy] So we get the year I hope.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,016
[George] So, should we do a race?

97
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,320
We'll do a quick corner.

98
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,980
I mean... I'm doing quite enough.

99
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,576
- [laughs]
- [Robert talking indistinctly]

100
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,760
Paddy simulation.

101
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,300
Oh, this is good.

102
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,140
It's not just back at base
that Williams are making changes.

103
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,540
They've got two brand new drivers
for 2019.

104
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,560
[Claire] Are you ready for the
professionals to come and kick your ass?

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,596
- [man] So, we having a race, are we?
- [Claire] Yes.

106
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,280
[Robert] We give you the advantage.
How many laps?

107
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,480
- [Claire] Shut up, "how many laps."
- [all laugh]

108
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,840
[Claire] "How many laps?"

109
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,240
- Do you know who pays your wages?
- [all laugh]

110
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
[Claire] Christ.

111
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,980
<i>Our driver lineup's wonderful this year.</i>

112
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,440
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

113
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,820
I was really clear around what we wanted.

114
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,540
I can't even see the car.

115
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,140
- It's right...
- Oh, yeah.

116
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,540
[Claire] <i>Robert and George
are two quite different personalities.</i>

117
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,800
<i>George is, I think,
a one-in-a-million driver.</i>

118
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,980
<i>He rarely puts a foot wrong.</i>

119
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,300
- Oh! [chuckles]
- Hey!

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,200
Man, come on.

121
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,060
- Who's the yellow one?
- That's me.

122
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,220
George Russell, hotly tipped,
Mercedes youngster,

123
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,940
Formula 2 champion. Really exciting guy.

124
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,920
[commentator] <i>He can see
the checkered flag. George Russell wins!</i>

125
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,400
[Claire] <i>He's fought his way up the ranks.</i>

126
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,820
Some pretty senior people in F1
who know what they're talking about,

127
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,460
there's a lot of talk that George
is a future world champion.

128
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,356
- Have you won?
- [Claire shrieks]

129
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,760
- George!
- [George] Sorry, Claire.

130
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,096
- [Claire] That's really unsportsmanlike.
- [George] I know. Right.

131
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,940
I'm George Russell.
I'm racing for Rokit Williams Racing.

132
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,880
<i>For me, it's a dream
to be part of Formula 1.</i>

133
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,840
I've lived my whole life
wanting to become an F1 driver.

134
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,400
Out of the hundreds and thousands
of people who've tried, I'm one of 20.

135
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,260
And that's... Yeah, that's incredible.

136
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,460
Oh, my God, my eyes are going weird.

137
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,820
- You're surprisingly not... [chuckles]
- Oh!

138
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,480
Something's gone wrong.

139
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
- Yes!
- [laughs]

140
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,260
- I'm surprisingly what? Not bad?
- You're surprisingly not... Oh! [laughs]

141
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,400
Can't believe you said that
I'm surprisingly not that bad.

142
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,820
Oh, no.

143
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,260
This is all we did at home
when we were growing up. Oh!

144
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Robert's at pole. Robert's at pole.

145
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,536
[Claire] <i>I wanted Robert in the car,</i>

146
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,960
<i>'cause I wanted a driver that was able
to understand the issues with the car.</i>

147
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,080
<i>Robert had seriously impressed us
over the course of last year,</i>

148
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,620
<i>as our development driver.</i>

149
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,300
I'm Robert Kubica, I'm from Poland
and I'm racing for Rokit Williams Racing.

150
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,660
It is strange to be back in Formula 1
after more than eight years.

151
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,400
[Will] <i>Talk to anybody from go-kart
all the way up to Formula 1,</i>

152
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,240
Robert was one of, if not the best.

153
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,240
[crowd cheering]

154
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,560
Robert was the one they feared,

155
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,800
the one that they knew
could and would make it.

156
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,160
He was supposed to go to Ferrari
to join Fernando.

157
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,420
That was supposed to be the dream team.

158
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,620
My career, unfortunately,
changed quite drastically.

159
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,040
<i>In 2011, I suffered
a big accident in Italy.</i>

160
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,340
<i>I suffered a lot of injuries.</i>

161
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,020
The crash was so bad
that it nearly severed his right arm.

162
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,520
<i>The fact he can control a Formula 1 car
is incredible to all of us.</i>

163
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,460
<i>It's a huge thing for Robert to come back.</i>

164
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
<i>It is the Hollywood story.</i>

165
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,140
<i>It's one of the great sporting comebacks.</i>

166
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,840
To be back is a dream.

167
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,060
[Claire] <i>He's a bit like a dog
with a bone.</i>

168
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,120
<i>He will push and push and push
until we fix the issues with the car,</i>

169
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,540
<i>and he is not shy in telling us
what those issues are.</i>

170
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,380
- My finger's hurting.
- [man laughs]

171
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,440
They signify everything that
I've always wanted in a driver lineup.

172
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
Oh, yes. I'm still in the...

173
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,736
- Am I still in the lead?
- [man] You are.

174
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,780
[George] Oh, no! [chuckles]

175
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,040
[man] Claire wins!

176
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,000
- Did I win? Did I?
- [man] You win.

177
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,380
- Mentally, I'm destroyed now.
- [laughs]

178
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,320
That's better.

179
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,040
Everything is focused on getting your car
to that first day of testing.

180
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,376
[Claire] Would you...
There are a few bits of printing.

181
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,180
Would you mind just printing them for me?
It's a letter.

182
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,320
Thank you very much.

183
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,660
<i>This is car build week.</i>

184
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,480
Mike, I'm on my way down.

185
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,800
<i>It's gotta go on Saturday night,
and everything has gotta be on it.</i>

186
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,360
<i>Everything's gotta be ready.</i>

187
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
Doesn't that blue look nice?

188
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,520
- [man] Yeah.
- I can see...

189
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,176
- Have you seen your team kit yet?
- Yeah.

190
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,280
- [Claire] Do you like it?
- It's really nice, yeah.

191
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,300
[drilling]

192
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,200
[Claire] <i>People just think we have a car,</i>

193
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,040
<i>and it goes around the world
to every race.</i>

194
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,840
<i>A few guys change the tires on it,
and that's about it.</i>

195
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,660
You have to depressurize,
so they both can get through there.

196
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,740
So we can get this all the way down.

197
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,080
[Claire] <i>These cars
are extraordinarily complex.</i>

198
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,060
<i>There's 20,000 parts
that we're manufacturing ourselves.</i>

199
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,140
[man 1] How many of these have we got?

200
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,120
- One for the moment?
- [man 2] Yeah, we're not gonna scrap it.

201
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,340
[man 1] No, no, no.

202
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,960
[Claire] <i>When you are an independent team,</i>

203
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,140
<i>when you are a team
on a budget the size of ours,</i>

204
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,980
<i>it's an extraordinary challenge
to actually get your car to testing.</i>

205
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,656
[man 3] The rear end is on there,

206
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,040
and the rear end
is actually structurally complete.

207
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,540
The mirror idea is a real winner.

208
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,420
Haven't heard that word for a long time.

209
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,720
- [man 3] Yeah.
- Jesus.

210
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,456
- [man 3] And it's...
- [Claire] New wing mirrors.

211
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,540
They could be the reversal of our fortune.

212
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,620
- [man 3] Yeah.
- [Claire] Something so simple.

213
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,300
[man 3] We are a very, very long way
behind having a finished car here

214
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,240
before we go to the test.

215
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,560
Massive challenge at the moment
is the delivery of diffuser.

216
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,320
[Claire] What's the issue
with the diffuser?

217
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,500
- What's the holdup on that?
- [man 3] Um...

218
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,640
The complexity of the parts
are delaying the delivery.

219
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,160
And we've got a host
of components which

220
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,000
We've got an issue with
the front bell crank

221
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,360
pivot shafts are not finished.

222
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,700
The pin for the tower bracket
we've somewhat lost track of.

223
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,696
These are for bigger problems that...

224
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,960
We haven't even got any wheel nuts
to hold the wheels on.

225
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,740
Have we not worked it out yet?

226
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,580
- [man 4] We're still digging into it.
- [man 3] Still digging into it.

227
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,680
[woman] Meeting with Mike and Nicky.

228
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,920
Did you say tomorrow?

229
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,680
[Paddy] No.
I need to speak with them today.

230
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,400
- Okay.
- [cell phone rings]

231
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Hello?

232
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,740
Yes, speaking.

233
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,240
<i>It's not all on schedule at the moment.</i>

234
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,960
Uh, we have had a number of slippages.

235
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,920
<i>There are 101 different issues
with the car that weren't expected.</i>

236
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,056
<i>They're all being dealt with,</i>

237
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,880
and, inevitably, that means that things
can take longer than was planned.

238
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,120
Re-machine the holes? Change the dials.

239
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,920
But we will get to the test.

240
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,020
<i>We always do.</i>

241
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,656
- [Claire] Everything's all right?
- [man 1] Yeah.

242
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,600
[Claire] Still smiling?

243
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
- Yeah.
- [man 2] Good.

244
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,340
[Claire] It's in better shape
than it did yesterday.

245
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,240
Yeah. It's just frustrating,
the little bits of rig parts.

246
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,520
[Claire] Yes. Yes, I know.

247
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,700
It will be an extraordinary feat
if we make this on Monday, right?

248
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,100
- Yeah. Yeah.
- [Claire] Which we're gonna.

249
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,580
Yeah. We are.

250
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,996
- I'll leave you to it. We will.
- [man] I hope so. Yeah.

251
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,560
- See you later.
- [man] See you.

252
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,840
[indistinct chatter]

253
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,280
[Will] <i>There are only eight days
of pre-season testing...</i>

254
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,860
to put your car on track, figure out
what works, figure out what doesn't.

255
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,280
<i>To be as ready as your rivals</i>

256
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,280
<i>once you get to the first race
of the year.</i>

257
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,780
The big news really today is the fact
that Williams will not run today

258
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,500
and they won't run tomorrow, either.

259
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,320
<i>The car isn't ready yet.</i>

260
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,720
It was a huge shock.

261
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,980
<i>With only eight days
of pre-season testing,</i>

262
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,880
<i>every second on track counts.</i>

263
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,900
<i>Missing half a day,
missing an hour is huge.</i>

264
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
<i>You don't miss testing.</i>

265
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,136
[Claire] I'll take that one with me.

266
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,540
- [man 1] This one?
- Yeah.

267
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,341
- [man 1] And the other one?
- [man 2] This one's coming on this side.

268
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,320
They need to be very safeguarded.

269
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,600
- [man 2] I think I broke it.
- [Claire and man laughing]

270
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
- It's a million man-hours, right?
- [Claire] Yeah.

271
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,660
That is a lot of blood, sweat
and tears in there.

272
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,740
<i>Realizing the car isn't going to be ready
for winter testing brings out disbelief.</i>

273
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,040
<i>It was like, "Are you kidding?
How did this happen?</i>

274
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,540
<i>How did we get to this point?</i>

275
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,780
<i>How do we protect the damage
that this is going to do?"</i>

276
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,780
<i>I was... I was incredibly angry.</i>

277
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,540
Get these bits to the garage
'cause they need to start working on them.

278
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,396
They're gonna have their work
cut out this morning

279
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,860
getting all those bits on the car.

280
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,440
It would be so nice
to see it out on the track.

281
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,300
It's not been a good few days.

282
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,700
I'm hoping that when people
see it on track today,

283
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,116
everyone will have forgotten about it

284
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,960
and hopefully will bring us
a bit of performance.

285
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,600
And to have George and Robert,
it's really exciting.

286
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,400
I can't wait to see those guys
get in the car for the first time.

287
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,700
It'll be really nice.

288
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,680
[Will] <i>It's not unheard of for parts
to be flown out last minute,</i>

289
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,660
<i>but when team management
are flying out with them,</i>

290
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,400
<i>you get the impression
it's pretty drastic.</i>

291
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:50,820
[Claire] Here you go.

292
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,240
How you doing? You all right?

293
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,420
We've got your bits.

294
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,840
[Will] <i>At times like this, you can't look
to the boys on the factory floor.</i>

295
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,980
<i>They're doing as much as they can
with the equipment at their disposal.</i>

296
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,360
<i>It has to go higher.</i>

297
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,360
The ultimate question is
where does the buck stop?

298
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,960
<i>Does it stop with the person appointed
to head that technical direction</i>

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,396
<i>and the ultimate design of the car,</i>

300
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,160
<i>or does it fall to the person
who made that appointment?</i>

301
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,980
<i>Whose head's on the block?</i>

302
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,720
[Claire] Are you all right?

303
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
[Dave] Yeah.

304
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,480
It's just nice to see
the car in the garage.

305
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,060
Christ.

306
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,640
If we could've had it three weeks ago,
we'd be laughing.

307
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,560
Hi, Claire.

308
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,660
Hindsight, Dave, is a wonderful thing.

309
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Hi, Paddy. You all right?

310
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,460
- How was your flight?
- Fine.

311
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,400
- [Paddy] Early?
- Yeah, it was early.

312
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,120
Got all the bits with you?

313
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,200
Got the bits. Yeah.

314
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,280
They're out at the back. Yeah.

315
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
[Claire sighs]

316
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,820
It happens
when you get out onto the grounds.

317
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,020
[Claire] Yeah.
All right, let's see those bits.

318
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,500
- Hi. You all right?
- [woman] Yeah. You?

319
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,636
- [Claire] Yeah.
- [woman] Good.

320
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,020
Yes. All good.

321
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,040
[reporter] But what has been
the reason of the delay?

322
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,300
We're not going to be discussing
those issues in public.

323
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
It's not ideal.

324
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,676
Um, this is not the situation
that we wanted to find ourselves in.

325
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,000
Particularly after last year.

326
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,440
We wanted to come out strongly.

327
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,580
<i>That's one of the hardest parts
of the job,</i>

328
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,240
<i>when you're feeling down and you feel
like you couldn't be kicked anymore.</i>

329
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,240
<i>I'm getting a kicking at the moment
from every angle.</i>

330
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,660
We're not just disappointed, but it's...

331
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,340
It's embarrassing not bringing
a race car to a circuit.

332
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,340
[Paddy] <i>I don't need anyone else
to give me a hard time.</i>

333
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,680
<i>I'm my worst judge, let's say.</i>

334
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,980
<i>The bottom line is
we didn't do the right things.</i>

335
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,120
<i>We have many difficulties at the moment.</i>

336
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,560
<i>Lots of challenges to face.</i>

337
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,800
<i>I suppose it's part of my makeup
to not reflect any sense of panic.</i>

338
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,560
<i>I'm an engineer,
so problems are objective.</i>

339
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,840
<i>They're not emotional things
because emotions don't get us anywhere.</i>

340
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,020
[engineer] You good?

341
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,980
- [George] Yeah. Ready for it.
- [engineer] Yeah?

342
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,120
Been ready for three days, mate.

343
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,620
[George] It feels like...

344
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,260
- This is how we normally do things.
- [George laughs]

345
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,820
We just leave it late.

346
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,940
Well, you can see there's a little bit
of a crowd around the Williams garage.

347
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,920
The good news for them is they have
finally got their car sorted out.

348
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,720
<i>So, Williams up and running,</i>

349
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,820
but a lot of questions being asked why
they initially missed the first two days.

350
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,920
[Paddy] Very large rank.

351
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,356
- [man 1] Sorry?
- Very large rank of media in here.

352
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,620
[man 1] Well, it's the only time
you've spoken in days.

353
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,820
[Claire] Yeah, we'll do that.

354
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
[Paddy] Work to do.

355
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,860
[man 2] Paddy, what happened?

356
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,220
Why was the car late?

357
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,520
Um, that is a very, very
complicated matter and I...

358
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,700
Frankly, I don't even know
the answer because it's...

359
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,940
It will take a lot of
investigation and analysis.

360
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,300
In general, the thing that
has got us out is the, uh...

361
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,420
The sheer quantity and complexity
of parts you have to produce

362
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,800
to make a Formula 1 car these days.

363
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,980
[Will] <i>I spoke to Paddy over testing
and he refused to take responsibility.</i>

364
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,700
<i>You're either responsible or you're not.</i>

365
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,060
<i>So, you gotta take it on the chin.</i>

366
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,720
And he kind of refused to do that, so...

367
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,260
[clicks tongue] See you later, Paddy.

368
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,120
[reporter] <i>There have been some
big developments at Williams.</i>

369
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,560

370
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,520
<i>"has taken a leave of absence from
the business for personal reasons."</i>

371
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,900
[interviewer] Can we talk
about Paddy at all?

372
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,320
[Claire] <i>There's no point
wasting that energy,</i>

373
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,320
<i>focusing on something
that's been and done.</i>

374
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,660
<i>You gotta move forward.</i>

375
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,920
<i>Formula 1 moves fast.</i>

376
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,320
<i>We gotta start racing
and that's where it really matters.</i>

377
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,476
- Okay. Bye, girls.
- [Claire] Kisses. Can I get kisses?

378
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,340
- Bye.
- [Marc] See you later. See you later.

379
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,180
Girls, go inside before you get cold.

380
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,480
Have a nice breakfast.

381
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,980
- Bye, monkey.
- [Claire] Okay.

382
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,400
I've got butterflies in my stomach.

383
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,500
I always get them driving to Silverstone.

384
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,660
I wonder what George and Robert must
feel like going into this race weekend.

385
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,580
[Marc] I don't worry, necessarily.

386
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,060
I just worry that we can keep it.
That's really important to me.

387
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Yeah.

388
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Yeah.

389
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,460
And I'm fed up with drivers.

390
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,640
Buggering off, leaving us
to go somewhere else.

391
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,300
We nurture all this talent
and then they get to go off...

392
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,096
- They get their success somewhere else.
- Yeah.

393
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,200
I want to be the one
that gives a driver a good car.

394
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,480
<i>Formula 1 is not easy.</i>

395
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,060
<i>Sometimes, I think to myself,
"Christ, when is it gonna get easier</i>

396
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,980
<i>and what more do we have to do
to close that gap down to the midfield?"</i>

397
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,920
<i>We're here in this sport
because we love racing.</i>

398
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,640
<i>We do not love being
at the back of the pack.</i>

399
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,196
- Good morning!
- [George] Good morning.

400
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,100
Are you gonna get near
the podium this morning?

401
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,580
I will do my best,
but I can't promise anything.

402
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,056
- [woman 1] Of course he will.
- [George] Thank you.

403
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,296
- [woman 2] Good to see you.
- [man] Drive well.

404
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,520
Thank you. Likewise.

405
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,580
Nice to meet you.

406
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,820
Overall, it's not been ideal at all.

407
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,300
I mean, obviously, you dream of coming
into Formula 1 and winning races.

408
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,440
That's the dream.

409
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,220
[sighs] Morning.

410
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,100
Morning.

411
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,040
Just driving around on my own.

412
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,280
No one in front of me,
no one really behind me.

413
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,700
[man] Are you gonna race next year?

414
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,800
Can't tell you that.
Can't tell you that.

415
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,440
- Sorry, I have to go.
- Go.

416
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
- I'll see you later.
- [woman] Go.

417
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,940
[George] <i>Obviously, I want more.</i>

418
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,520
<i>I want to be a world champion.</i>

419
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,220
<i>I'd love to be in Lewis' shoes, you know.</i>

420
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:41,240
In a car, firstly, capable of winning
almost every single weekend,

421
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,080
and performing to a level
that he performs week in, week out.

422
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,740
<i>But I believe I'll get there one day.</i>

423
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,520
<i>I believe I'll have that opportunity.</i>

424
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,820
[reporter] Difficult to show
your potential

425
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,620
when you're always
at the back of the grid.

426
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,480
No, it's not difficult at all
because the people

427
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,600
who will make a difference in my career,

428
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,300
the top people at Williams,
the top people at Mercedes,

429
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,840
they know exactly how I'm performing,

430
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,980
even if the result isn't
exactly the same every week.

431
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,220
So, I have no concerns with that.

432
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
Cheers, thanks.

433
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,680
[Will] <i>George is on the Mercedes
young driver scheme,</i>

434
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,480
so that means he has, at least in part,
his future assured.

435
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,260
I'm late for something, guys.

436
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,240
Cheers. Thank you.

437
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,600
The air condition's calibrated so
that the most power goes in my room.

438
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,456
- That's why the race took their team off.
- [woman] That's probably true.

439
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,160
- It's not true.
- [woman chuckles] I know.

440
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:39,020
[Will] <i>Toto Wolff as head of Mercedes
has always been very impressed</i>

441
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,040
<i>and has always spoken
incredibly well of George.</i>

442
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,180
Whether that means George will make it
into the big Mercedes team?

443
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,300
Only time will tell.

444
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,340
But it's certainly on George's radar.

445
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,220
It's really nice to see
the Mercedes junior program

446
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,100
- has come back to life.
- Yeah.

447
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,060
And we're taking the most potential
young guys, and here we go.

448
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,540
Firstly, Mercedes are the number one team
in Formula 1 and have been for so long.

449
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,660
They were the guys
who invested in my junior career

450
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,980
and ultimately really helped me
to make the step into Formula 1.

451
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,380
[Toto] It's very rare that a rookie
wins the F2 season.

452
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,140
So, he won the F2 season,

453
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,380
- and now we have a problem.
- [man] I saw it last year.

454
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,460
[all chuckle]

455
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,136
- He's gonna be a future world champion.
- [man] I know.

456
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,100
That's what some of my colleagues...

457
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,180
- [Toto] They say that.
- [man]...told me earlier this year...

458
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,636
- When you put me in your car, Toto.
- [Toto] Yeah.

459
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,500
That's the... [chuckles]

460
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
[Toto] That's the trick.

461
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,500
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,160
[George] <i>Still quite incredible for me
how you can finish a lap,</i>

494
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,000
<i>it feels like one of the best laps
you've ever done in your life.</i>

495
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,900
<i>Still, in the scheme of things,</i>

496
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,740
<i>incredibly fast, but these guys
have just got something more.</i>

497
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,020
We need to sort this out.

498
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,880
We really, really need to sort this out.

499
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,400
<i>In my previous years, I had one target,</i>

500
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,420
<i>and that was, you either put it on pole
or win the race.</i>

501
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,840
<i>I'm driving around in 19th position
week in, week out and...</i>

502
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,640
<i>I don't wanna be there.</i>

503
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,980
[Claire] <i>I'm sure he's frustrated
by some things</i>

504
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,640
<i>that we haven't been able
to action fast enough.</i>

505
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,340
<i>I wish for both of them that
we'd given them a better car this year.</i>

506
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,300
- It's pretty brutal out there.
- [George] Yeah. I know. Tell me about it.

507
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,760
[man] Frustrating, isn't it?

508
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,680
[Claire] <i>You've gotta take the small wins
to make yourself feel good every so often.</i>

509
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,540
<i>Okay. We beat Vettel.</i>

510
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,800
[laughs]

511
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,600
- Yeah. Exactly.
- [man] Yeah.

512
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,800
Yeah. We did.

513
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,940
You're not spraying champagne
each and every weekend.

514
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,820
<i>Only one team can do that.
Only one driver can do that.</i>

515
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,980
[George] It's just a joke at the moment.

516
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,280
I've never been
so inconsistent in my life.

517
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,360
You look at my lap chart,
you think I'm a bloody rookie or whatever.

518
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,540
I felt like I was driving very similar
lap after lap, and it was like a yo-yo.

519
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
I felt like an idiot.

520
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,080
We need to seriously pull our fingers out.

521
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,320
[man] Okay. All right.
We'll see what we can do about that.

522
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,540
Good job. Well done. Well done, thank you.

523
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,540
[Frank] No real point.

524
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,060
[Claire] No. We were only lapped once
which makes a change.

525
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,960
Yeah.

526
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,820
[indistinct chatter]

527
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,380
[Claire] <i>Certainly,
I feel enormous pressure</i>

528
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,560
<i>whether I'm good enough to do this job.</i>

529
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,380
<i>The pressure is there
because it is our family business</i>

530
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,820
<i>and I took this job on
for a very particular purpose,</i>

531
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,920
<i>and that was to protect a legacy.</i>

532
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,916
- Is that it?
- [interviewer 1] All good.

533
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,780
- Yeah?
- [interviewer 1] Yeah.

534
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,820
Okay.

535
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,040
You didn't ask the last question about,

536
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,400
"Has Williams got a future
or is Williams going to be in trouble?"

537
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,700
- [interviewer 2] I didn't?
- No. [chuckles]

538
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,760
[interviewer 1] She didn't...

539
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,796
I was thinking when I read it, I was like,
"I am not answering that question."

540
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,236
And then I was thinking about it
and I said,

541
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,056
- "Maybe I should answer that question."
- [interviewer 2] Do you wanna answer it?

542
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,920
- You can.
- Yeah.

543
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,596
[interviewer 2] I was told you didn't want
to hear it because you shouldn't.

544
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,520
- I don't wanna...
- [Claire] No.

545
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,036
[interviewer 2] Make you answer
something you don't wanna answer.

546
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,320
You can ask me. Ask me the question.

547
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,380
[interviewer 2] So, is there a danger
that if this goes on,

548
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,776
- it could be the end of Williams for you?
- [Claire] Yeah. Okay.

549
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,540
Williams isn't on its way out

550
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,140
just 'cause it's had a few...
A couple of bad years.

551
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,976
We're fighters,
at the end of the day, at Williams.

552
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,440
That was what we do.

553
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,476
We will fight
whether we're winning the championship

554
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,356
or we'll fight
if we're losing the championship,

555
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,180
and we will continue
to fight in this sport

556
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,740
for many, many years to come.

557
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,860
You're Netflix?

558
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,440
Not anymore. Fuck you, Netflix.

559
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,620
[crowd cheering]

560
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,740
[man 1] This is where
I'll have my single life.

561
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,400
This is the no-go zone.

562
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,180
[man 2] What do you think you did better
than Pierre Gasly to grab his seat?

563
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,300
[chuckles]

564
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,880
[man 3] <i>What the hell is he doing?</i>

565
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:26,440
If I get knocked,
I try to knock even harder.

566
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,780
[man 4] Very hard
to keep up with that man.

567
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,820
- [yells indistinctly]
- [screaming]

568
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,680
[man 5] This is the best day of my life.
