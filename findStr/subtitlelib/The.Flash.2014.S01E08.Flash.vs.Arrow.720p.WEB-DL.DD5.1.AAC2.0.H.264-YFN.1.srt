1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:06,105
- My name is barry allen,
and I'm the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,806
When I was a child,
I saw my mother

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,241
Killed by something impossible.

4
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,542
- Run, barry, run!

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,112
- My father went to prison
for her murder.

6
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:17,182
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

7
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,450
To the outside world,

8
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,818
I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,621
But secretly I use my speed
to fight crime

10
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,123
And find others like me,

11
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,792
And one day I'll find
who killed my mother...

12
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:29,461
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

13
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:32,064
I am the flash.

14
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:34,833
Previously, on<i> the flash</i>
<i>and arrow...</i>

15
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:36,368
I'm just not sure I'm like you,
oliver.

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,138
I don't know
if I can be some vigilante.

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,807
- You can be better,
because you can inspire people

18
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,342
In a way that I never could.

19
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,511
- You said you were writing
about me to bring hope

20
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,079
To someone you care about.

21
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,314
How would he feel if doing that
put you in harm's way?

22
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,183
- You're giving hope
to a lot of people.

23
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,052
So I'm doing this for them.
- Barry, when you met me,

24
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:56,622
Oliver, and dig, we were this
well-oiled archery machine,

25
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,123
But it didn't
start out that way.

26
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,958
- I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you tonight.

27
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,795
You're worth being on time for.

28
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,967
Everyone on this planet,
at some point in their lives,

29
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,136
Has had a major case
of the feels...

30
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,138
Those days when your heart
is just too small

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,543
To hold the big things
you're feeling.

32
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:20,179
Today's one of those days.

33
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,215
We think of our emotions like
they're these unique,

34
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:25,050
Personal phenomena,

35
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:28,454
That no one has ever felt
what we have felt.

36
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:32,024
There is a basis in science
for every emotion we feel...

37
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,725
Anger, love.

38
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,328
As a scientist,
I know there's nothing magical

39
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,598
About what makes us feel
something for someone else...

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,801
But then I see her smile.

41
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,504
Man, that cannot be science.

42
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:49,108
- ♪ whoo, I want it, whoo ♪

43
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,715
- Oh, and there's a fresh bottle
in the fridge

44
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,118
When she wakes up from her nap.

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,953
Thank you.

46
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,191
- Sir?
Help you with something?

47
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,660
- Thanks.

48
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,096
I'll be just fine on my own.

49
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,811
- Sir, you're not allowed
to be back here.

50
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,880
- Nothing to get upset about.

51
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,195
- Barry, bank robbery
in progress

52
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,831
At cunningham and sampere.
- I got it.

53
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,199
- Wait, that's where I bank.

54
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:50,702
- Once super thieves showed up,
I went mattress.

55
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,238
- I've already missed the gym.

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,142
- Ugh, no.
Five more minutes.

57
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,811
Come on,
we never get to sleep in.

58
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,981
- I know.
But your dad hates tardiness.

59
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,219
Buzzkill.

60
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:43,188
- The buzziest.

61
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,296
Another picture of the flash
came in.

62
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,431
See?

63
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,133
- That red blur?

64
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,535
How do you know that wasn't
photoshopped?

65
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,803
- It wasn't.

66
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:01,373
It's not a hoax
or a mass hallucination.

67
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:05,410
You know, every day, someone new
accepts the impossible

68
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,446
And believes in him.

69
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,047
Why can't you?

70
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,484
- I believe in what I can see...

71
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,686
What I can touch...

72
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:17,689
What I can feel.

73
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:21,093
Which means I believe in you.
- Mm.

74
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,633
- Do you mind?
Thanks, man.

75
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,801
- Hey.
- Busy morning.

76
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,670
Witnesses reported
seeing a red streak?

77
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:33,972
- Joe, you should have seen it.
It was like everybody in here

78
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,974
Was trying to kill each other.
I got here just in time.

79
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,676
- Well, it must've
been a diversion,

80
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,312
Because there's 1/2 million
bucks missing from the vault.

81
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,080
There's a tracer
in the cash stacks.

82
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,649
We're trying to find the signal.

83
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:48,053
Meantime, any idea what could've
caused such mass...

84
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,455
This?
- A neurotoxin, maybe.

85
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,858
I'm going to swab some surfaces,
see what I can find,

86
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,061
But I think maybe
they got whammied.

87
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:59,298
- Did you just say "whammied"?
- I got so angry.

88
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,934
I can't believe I did that.
I would never hurt anybody.

89
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,305
You have to believe me.
- I do.

90
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,206
Something is happening
in this city

91
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,208
And everyone wants to pretend
like it isn't, but it is,

92
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,311
And I think we should do
something about it.

93
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,479
- My boyfriend has decided
we need to eat healthy at home,

94
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,750
So work is now the only place
I can eat what I like.

95
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:22,020
Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying
something, detective?

96
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:24,323
- The blur, the flash,
the man in the red suit...

97
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,325
Whatever he's called...
he was spotted at the bank

98
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,293
This morning.
- You mean the bank

99
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,329
That was robbed
of 1/2 million dollars,

100
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,564
Where a dozen people tried
to murder each other,

101
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,533
And you think our attention
should be focused on

102
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,202
Catching santa claus.
- I can't explain

103
00:05:37,204 --> 00:05:40,138
How he gets to and from
crime scenes so fast.

104
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,076
We need to figure out who this
guy is and what he wants.

105
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:46,011
- You should
ask your girlfriend.

106
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,781
She writes fan fiction
about him.

107
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,417
- Joe, help me out here.

108
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,685
- Sorry, partner.

109
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,621
I stopped believing in santa
when I was about eight.

110
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,296
- Hey.
What's going on in there?

111
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:06,898
- I think eddie's trying
to convince the captain

112
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,301
That the flash
is a public menace.

113
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,802
- Excuse me?

114
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,606
- So after weeks of my trying
to convince you

115
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,241
That the flash is real,

116
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:17,876
Now that you finally
do believe me,

117
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,378
You're trying
to have him arrested?

118
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,712
What the hell?
- Thanks, barry.

119
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,047
- Sorry.

120
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,083
- No worries.
The captain shot me down.

121
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,785
Look, I'm not feeling
like lunch.

122
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,387
See you later.

123
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,792
- He's just jealous.

124
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,627
- Of the flash?

125
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,828
Should he be?

126
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,131
- No.

127
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:42,267
I'll see you later.

128
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,335
- Barry,

129
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:45,170
You need to get
to s.T.A.R. Labs.

130
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:48,440
- Yeah, I will.
After I eat.

131
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:58,517
- Anger, hate, aggression.

132
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:02,154
A jedi craves not these things.

133
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,755
No one is feeling that quote?

134
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,924
- Everyone in the bank
went total savage for,

135
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,292
Like, five minutes.

136
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,593
And then they were fine again.

137
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,729
- Anger can be
a powerful emotion.

138
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:13,365
If this meta-human can engender
irrational feelings of anger

139
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,434
In his victims,
he can do a lot of damage.

140
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:17,469
- Detective west helped get
a copy of the cat scans

141
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,771
The hospital did on everyone
at the bank.

142
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,207
Take a look.

143
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,508
- Well, look at this,

144
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,143
The emotion centers
of the brains

145
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,479
Are still showing signs
of being overwhelmed.

146
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,615
- Particularly the area that
controls executive function.

147
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,717
That's the part of the brain
that stops people from doing

148
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,753
Whatever random and potentially
destructive thing

149
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,121
That pops into their head.

150
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,622
- How do you think the meta
does it to them?

151
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,825
- That's the 1/2 million dollar
question.

152
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,630
- Hey, if you guys figure it
out, just give me a call, okay?

153
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,700
- Is the flash off to another
rooftop rendezvous with iris?

154
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:50,702
- No.

155
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,972
Yeah, but she probably just
wants to ask me...

156
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,175
I mean, you know, him... about
meta-human stuff for her blog.

157
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,844
- Do you want some advice?

158
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,046
- No matter what I say,
I'm getting the advice, right?

159
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,247
- Don't get involved.

160
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,616
As the flash or yourself.

161
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,286
You don't want to be the one
to blame for their breakup.

162
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:10,489
- Okay.
I hear you.

163
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:22,300
Iris.
- Flash.

164
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,938
Be great to call you
by your real name.

165
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,641
- You mean like ralph?

166
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,610
- Is your name ralph?

167
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,748
- What did you want
to see me about?

168
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,283
- My boyfriend, he's...

169
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,918
- Did you guys break up?

170
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,721
- No.
- Oh.

171
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:47,125
- He's a cop and he thinks
that you're dangerous.

172
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,427
And he's trying to convince
his boss that you're a menace

173
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,096
That needs to be stopped.

174
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:54,833
I thought I should warn you.

175
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:58,236
Anyways, you should probably go.

176
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,041
You're not going.

177
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,376
Barry, are you there?

178
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,777
- What?
- The police got a ping

179
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,579
From the tracer hidden
in the stolen cash.

180
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,215
Swat team's closing in
on the 1600 block of pass.

181
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:13,852
- Now stop ruining
iris' love life and go.

182
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:16,021
- I've gotta run.

183
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:19,324
- I bet you say that
to all the girls.

184
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:21,760
- What other girls?

185
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,846
- He always paid in cash.

186
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,349
Never seemed like trouble.
- He's on the move.

187
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,387
- Freeze!
- Hold it right there!

188
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:53,592
- Hands up.
- Is there a problem, gentlemen?

189
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:54,793
- Certo.

190
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,332
Turn around!

191
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,938
Certo, what are you waiting for?
Cuff him!

192
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,507
- You don't tell me what to do.

193
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,577
- Get down!

194
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,257
Ugh!
Ah!

195
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,829
- Nice mask.

196
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,679
- It's kinda comforting to know
that no matter

197
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,614
What city you go to,
big belly burger is always

198
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,617
Going to taste
like big belly burger.

199
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,353
- You mean full of grease
and salt?

200
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,555
- I thought those were
the secret ingredients.

201
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,825
Oliver's back.

202
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,097
- By the way, I gave oliver,
like, 1/2 hour head start.

203
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,134
- Hi, barry.
- Hey, felicity.

204
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,803
How you doing, dig?

205
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,738
- You're fast.

206
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,240
- Did you guys not tell him
about me?

207
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:18,209
- Seeing is believing, or...

208
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,178
Drooling.

209
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,322
- Hey, thanks for showing up
back there, but I had that.

210
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,391
- Uh-huh.
- What, I was getting ready

211
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,460
To make my move.
- What move?

212
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:37,862
The one to the morgue?
- Wait, so what are you guys

213
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,799
Doing in central city?
- Working a case.

214
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:45,036
Suspicious homicide in the
styling where the murder weapon

215
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,905
Is a boomerang.

216
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,942
- Cool.

217
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,510
I mean, awful.

218
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,479
- I found traces
of iron oxide on it.

219
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:56,047
I know it's a long shot,
but central city has

220
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,283
The highest concentration of
iron oxide in the country.

221
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,684
- Did you know australian
aboriginals

222
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,352
Use boomerangs to hunt?
Mainly on kangaroo,

223
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,455
Which is a surprisingly
low-fat source of prot...

224
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,156
we were following up a lead

225
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,392
When we heard the s.W.A.T. Raid
over the radio, and I thought

226
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:11,262
That I would come by...
Watch you make your move.

227
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,331
- I had a cousin got hit
by lightning once.

228
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,433
He just developed a stutter.

229
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,935
- Huh.
Well, my team and I

230
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,004
Are after a nasty meta-human
who makes people angry.

231
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:21,206
Cool.

232
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,941
- I mean, awful.

233
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,843
- Uh, well, since you guys
are here, why don't we team up?

234
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,611
I'll help you find your
boomerang man, you can help me

235
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,346
Find my super rage-a-holic.
- We'd love to.

236
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,515
- No, we'll handle our business
and head home.

237
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,117
- The fastest way to find out
everything we need to know

238
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,852
About the boomerang is to sic
s.T.A.R. Labs on it.

239
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,054
- Enough people know
my secret identity.

240
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,823
- Fine... I'll go.
They already know who I am.

241
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,627
You can drop me off, and I will
meet up with you later.

242
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,562
- How 'bout I give you a lift?
- Whoo!

243
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,202
- Man,
that's not freaking you out?

244
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,972
- Let's go.

245
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,445
- Oh!
- So what'd you think?

246
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,679
- I think...

247
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,481
My shirt's on fire!

248
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,917
- Oh, I'm sorry!

249
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,525
I'm glad I decided
not to go braless.

250
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:15,126
- You guys remember felicity?

251
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,362
- I'll always remember this.

252
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,430
- Hi, felicity,
it's so good to see you.

253
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,966
What brings you
back to central city?

254
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,101
Not barry?

255
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,502
- No, not barry.

256
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,905
This?
Not happening.

257
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,407
We looked down that road
and we said "no, thank you."

258
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,509
- They get it.

259
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:35,246
- Actually, I'm here...
Because of this.

260
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,048
Awesome!

261
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,583
What are the wings made of?

262
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,485
- Not sure... I'm thinking
some sort of composite

263
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,020
Or high-density plastic...

264
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,122
- Reinforced with carbon fiber.
Oh, that's weird.

265
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,124
It almost feels like it's...
- vibrating.

266
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:47,592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

267
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,194
Oh, I wanna run some tests,

268
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:51,496
And I wanna run 'em right now!
- Mm-hmm.

269
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,099
- Hey, you guys come up
with anything new on our meta?

270
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,001
- The officer who was affected
tonight says he saw

271
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,637
A flash of red
before he lost control.

272
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:03,374
I suspect the meta is inducing
rage via the ocular nerve.

273
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,110
Oh, dr. Wells
wants to see you.

274
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,750
- Why do I feel like
I just got called

275
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,953
Into the principal's office?

276
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,956
- Starling city vigilante.

277
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,091
- He calls himself
"the arrow" now.

278
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,427
- Oh, does he...
"flash"?

279
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,395
- Wait, what's the problem?

280
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,564
- We don't trust him.

281
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,633
- You guys don't even know him.

282
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,201
- I know that he was wanted
for murder

283
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,837
In at least 12 different cases
dating back three years.

284
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,939
- I know there's been at least
two major terrorist attacks

285
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,075
In starling
since he became active.

286
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,509
- All right, but the cops there
are cool with him now.

287
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:39,811
He doesn't kill people anymore.

288
00:14:39,813 --> 00:14:41,679
- And what about
all the criminals

289
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,715
That he put arrows through?
Those, what, don't count?

290
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,452
- He's a hero, joe.
- You're a hero, barry.

291
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,121
You offer protection,
hope, light.

292
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,858
What that man does is carry out
a dark reckoning for his city.

293
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,461
It is a brutal, violent vision
of justice,

294
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,396
One we do not share.
You truly think

295
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,964
He's a hero,
fine, so be it.

296
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:03,635
But he's not the kind
you should be looking up to.

297
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:08,172
- Aah!

298
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,181
- That's my bad.
That's on me.

299
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,221
- I want that "arrow"
out of my city.

300
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,123
Tonight.

301
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,861
- Tell me, do you think he can
do everything really fast?

302
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,829
I mean, like, how fast do you
think he goes to the bathroom

303
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,798
After he's eaten something?

304
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,867
- This is you watching my back?

305
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,771
- Well, the mirakuru soldiers
are one thing, but this...

306
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,073
- Whatever he can do now,
he's still the same barry

307
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,775
We met last year.
- Well, if you're so adamant

308
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,010
Against teaming up with him,
what are we doing here?

309
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,080
- He's a good kid,
and it's just a name, diggle.

310
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,017
The man who rents
this storage unit...

311
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,554
I want... His... Name.

312
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,262
- Hey.

313
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,864
- The bad guy that you're after,
the one who robbed the bank,

314
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,833
His name is roy g. Bivolo.

315
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,869
- Uh, thanks.
How did you find that out?

316
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,174
The guy's still alive, right?

317
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,542
I'm just asking.

318
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,143
I thought you
didn't want to help.

319
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,880
- I'm not.
It's just a name.

320
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,215
- All right.
- Hi.

321
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:25,650
- Hey.
- Ooh!

322
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,386
- One non-fat latte,
extra sugar for felicity,

323
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,990
And one coffee, black,
for oliver.

324
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:34,158
I brewed you a fresh pot,
so...

325
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,228
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

326
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,465
Barry, um, can I talk to you
for a second?

327
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,433
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

328
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,801
- Bye.

329
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,406
- Ow.
What are you doing?

330
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:51,609
- You did not tell me
that you knew oliver queen.

331
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,910
- I know oliver queen.
- Oh, my god,

332
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,512
He's even more handsome
in person.

333
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,681
And his arms are, like,
twice the size of yours.

334
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,783
- Technically
they're not twice the size.

335
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,151
- He's on my three list.

336
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,886
- What's a three list?
- My list

337
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,788
Of three guys I'm allowed
to cheat on eddie with.

338
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,490
You usually don't meet people
on your list,

339
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:10,261
But now here he is, and I just
cannot stop staring at him.

340
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,799
- Felicity,
this is me noticing you staring.

341
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,001
- We need to help barry
with his case.

342
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,703
Why don't you want to help?

343
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,605
- Because barry doesn't
really want my help.

344
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:22,340
He only thinks he does.

345
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,043
- Harrison wells
and barry's cop foster dad

346
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,112
Both said you were dangerous
and a bad influence.

347
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,782
Barry defended you.

348
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,350
- You're going to hock me
about this

349
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,053
Until I say yes, aren't you?

350
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,022
- I'm a hocker.

351
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,827
- Okay.

352
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:43,861
- Okay, what?
- Okay, we'll help you

353
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,163
Catch your bad guy.

354
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,731
- Great.
Meta-human.

355
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,233
- I am not calling him that,
barry.

356
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,137
- Partners?

357
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:55,173
- Partners.

358
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,887
- Hey.
- You're late.

359
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:11,956
Barry, how can you have
super-speed

360
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:14,292
And still not be on time?
- Sorry, I guess

361
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:17,528
The super-tardiness kinda
neutralizes it.

362
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,164
So how do we catch bivolo here?

363
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:23,367
- Oh, no, we don't here.
We're here to train.

364
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,303
- What?
Like<i> rocky?</i>

365
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,474
- I read your friend iris'
blog post on the flash,

366
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:32,777
And I visited all
the crime scenes you fought at.

367
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,145
- Don't you sleep?
- Last month

368
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,280
You took on a man
named leonard snart.

369
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,682
- We call him captain cold.

370
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:39,217
- We can talk about you giving
your enemies

371
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,952
Silly code names later.

372
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,122
- You mean like over coffee with
deathstroke and the huntress?

373
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,291
- The point is that you engaged
snart on a commuter train,

374
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,960
Which he derailed.

375
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,029
- Okay, there may have been some
damage, but I got the job done,

376
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,998
I was the hero.
- Barry, when you approach

377
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,668
A new environment, do you case
every inch of it?

378
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,606
You could.
You have the time.

379
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,475
But you don't.

380
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,444
You just run in blind.

381
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:09,947
There's a difference, barry,
between having powers

382
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,582
And having precision.

383
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,650
- When I came to you
thinking about

384
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,851
Going out and helping people,

385
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:15,586
You said
I could be an inspiration.

386
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,188
- Living this life...

387
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,223
Well,
it takes more than a mask.

388
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,791
It takes discipline.

389
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:23,294
And since you are probably
as stubborn as I am...

390
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,364
- What is that for?

391
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,432
- You're going to run
over there,

392
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,001
You're going to come back at me,

393
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,202
And you're going to get hit
with an arrow.

394
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:34,172
No, I'm not.

395
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,507
Yes, you are.

396
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,177
- Okay, fine,

397
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,945
I will humor you.

398
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,215
Ready?

399
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,286
- Ready.

400
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,157
- Nice try.

401
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,661
Gah!
Ah!

402
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,796
What, you shot me?

403
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,598
- I heard you heal fast.

404
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:03,935
Oh, god!

405
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,509
Hey.
What's up?

406
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,546
- Eddie's making his case
for the task force again.

407
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,548
- But I thought the captain
shot him down already.

408
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,785
- Well, apparently
he's got a new argument.

409
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,554
The arrow made another
appearance last night.

410
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,457
And you forgot to tell me
that you got bivolo's name

411
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,793
From shooting that storage guy
in the leg.

412
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,561
- Well, technically
I didn't shoot him.

413
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,430
- Well, what word
would you use to describe

414
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,864
How you got this info?

415
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:37,835
I'm gonna go with "torture."

416
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:39,904
- I don't... the arrow
gets results.

417
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,505
- He's a crazy man.

418
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:43,908
- Look, I don't actually
disagree with you at the moment,

419
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,209
But we wouldn't even have
bivolo's name

420
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,044
If it weren't for the arrow.

421
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,147
So maybe instead of judging him,
you should just be thanking him.

422
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,250
- Two things I won't be doing
in this life...

423
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,854
Playing professional baseball,
and thanking that lunatic.

424
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:00,891
- Stay.

425
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,426
- Have you heard
of color psychology?

426
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,861
- The theory that changes
in the color spectrum

427
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:05,329
Can affect emotion.

428
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:07,698
- It is so nice to have
another woman to talk to.

429
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,033
- I know.

430
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,635
- I was thinking
that if bivolo uses color

431
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,303
To induce the temporary
psychosis,

432
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,405
Maybe we can use light and color
to reverse it.

433
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:18,309
- Miss smoak,
a word, if you please.

434
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,815
- Hey, what's up, doc?

435
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:26,751
Sorry, that was dumb.

436
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,586
Remember I went to m.I.T.

437
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:30,221
- Yes, you're smart.

438
00:21:30,223 --> 00:21:33,324
Felicity, I like to surround my
team with known quantities.

439
00:21:33,326 --> 00:21:34,859
That is because I find
the unknown

440
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:38,029
To be toxic, dangerous.

441
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:41,065
The arrow is unknown.

442
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:46,404
- I can assure you, dr. Wells,
he's not dangerous.

443
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:48,306
To us.

444
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,342
- Well, of that,
I have little doubt.

445
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:54,745
And yet, I find myself
with a conundrum.

446
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:59,950
How can I completely trust a man
when I don't even know his name?

447
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,053
And so, I was hoping,
miss smoak,

448
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,622
That you could help me
trust him.

449
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:08,292
Who is he under the hood?

450
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:11,829
- That is not my secret to tell,
dr. Wells.

451
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,805
- Of course.

452
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:24,041
I'll figure it out on my own.

453
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,212
- Hey.
- Hey.

454
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,780
- How'd it go with oliver?

455
00:22:29,782 --> 00:22:31,015
- You know, to be honest,
not exactly the partnership

456
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,383
I thought it would be.

457
00:22:32,385 --> 00:22:34,819
- Oh, did he really do the thing
with the arrows?

458
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,320
- You knew
he was going to shoot me?

459
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,722
- Whoa, it is practically
impossible to tell

460
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:38,789
When oliver's making a joke.

461
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,624
- Hey, we just got a ping from

462
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:43,127
The facial recognition software
on bivolo, aka, prism.

463
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,029
- Since when do we have
facial recognition software?

464
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:46,597
- Happy chanukah.
- Where can I find him?

465
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,999
- Traffic cameras just caught
him entering a residence

466
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,968
At 168 jarvis.

467
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,603
- We should let the arrow know.

468
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,305
- I can handle this solo.
I've done it before.

469
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,973
- Barry, I really think
you need to wait...

470
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:59,276
- Felicity,
I don't need his help.

471
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:23,134
- I knew you'd be coming
for me.

472
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,636
I could see it in your eyes
at the bank.

473
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:29,140
When I turned those people
against each other,

474
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,976
It made you angry.

475
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,217
Have some real anger.

476
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:52,930
- No signs of macular damage.

477
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,566
Your retina and cornea
seem unaffected.

478
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,901
- I told you, I'm fine.

479
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,836
- You said bivolo whammied you.

480
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:01,405
No desire to go mma
on any of us?

481
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,440
- No.

482
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,875
Yeah, I mean,
something weird happened

483
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,911
With his eyes for a sec.
- Weird thing?

484
00:24:06,913 --> 00:24:09,513
- Yeah, everything went red.

485
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:11,248
- You were right.

486
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,251
- Okay, next thing you know,
bivolo was gone.

487
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,120
Look, obviously his powers
didn't work on me, so...

488
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,556
- It was stupid for you
to go out there alone.

489
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,291
You take too many risks.

490
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,860
As fast as you are, that's going
to catch up with you.

491
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:24,328
- Caitlin, I'm not ronnie.

492
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,363
You gotta stop treating me
like I am.

493
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,436
- You're right.
You're not.

494
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,043
- What?

495
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,546
- You are such a lovable dummy.

496
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,985
- It's oliver... he wants
to have another session.

497
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,988
- I'm sure he's not going
to shoot you again.

498
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,491
Maybe you should
wear body armor.

499
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,697
- Thinking of new ways
to embarrass me?

500
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,532
- I'm not trying
to embarrass you, barry,

501
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,935
But you went after bivolo
last night alone

502
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,403
And you lost him.

503
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,405
- And you've never
had a misstep?

504
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,074
- Course I've had missteps.

505
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:14,578
Barry, I have been living this
life for almost eight years,

506
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,748
Encountering things
that you can't even fathom,

507
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,217
And I am still alive.

508
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:24,655
Not because super-speed
kept me out of the ground.

509
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:28,526
It was because I realized
that I needed to keep learning,

510
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,228
Keep training,
keep getting smarter,

511
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,299
And until you get that,
despite your best intentions,

512
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:38,202
You will do more harm than good.

513
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,605
- I finally see it.

514
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:44,708
You're a little bit
jealous of me, aren't you?

515
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,913
A guy like you, handsome, rich,

516
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:50,648
Can have any girl he wants,

517
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,183
Jealousy's probably
a new emotion for you,

518
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:56,020
So you might be a little slow
to get what it is

519
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,588
That you're feeling.

520
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,424
- That's your theory?
- Absolutely.

521
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:03,294
So you can train, lift weights,

522
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:06,130
Climb that stupid barn
till your heart explodes,

523
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:09,199
But you'll never be
as fast as I am.

524
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:12,603
You'll never be what I am.

525
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:16,674
And that's gotta hurt
your rock-hard pride, ollie.

526
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,544
- I told felicity
you didn't want my help.

527
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:23,514
- Yeah. You're finally right
about something.

528
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,386
- Allen! Where are you
with the bivolo case?

529
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,921
- I'm working it.

530
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,556
- Care to be more specific?

531
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,925
Hey, how 'bout you answer me
when I ask you a question?

532
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,961
- Hey!
How 'bout you back off?

533
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:39,396
- Excuse me?

534
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:42,633
- Look, I work just as hard
as anyone in this building.

535
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:45,703
I don't need you constantly
berating me to do my job.

536
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,638
When it's done,
you will have it, all right?

537
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,108
- Sorry, captain.
He's having an allergic reaction

538
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,143
To some bad medication.

539
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,779
- You remind him
who answers to who.

540
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,617
- Have you lost your mind?

541
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,218
- I'm so sick of singh talking
to me like that.

542
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,653
- He's still our boss.

543
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,521
Now I know you're upset
about losing bivolo...

544
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,691
- Wait, wait...
You're just like him.

545
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:10,694
Like wells, and oliver,
and everyone else my whole life

546
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:12,396
That didn't think
I could get the job done.

547
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,932
Do you want to help me, joe?
You want to help me?

548
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,567
Get my dad out of prison.

549
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:18,035
You helped put him there,
didn't you?

550
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,471
- Barry, I need you
to calm down.

551
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,440
Why don't we both
take a ride to s.T.A.R. Labs?

552
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:25,175
- I'm calm!
Okay?

553
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,679
When I am not calm,
you'll know.

554
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,889
- Okay.
I'll call you back later.

555
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:40,324
That was the arrow.

556
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,893
He says barry
is acting strangely.

557
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,094
- Strangely, how?

558
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,530
- He's been whammied.

559
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,199
He was acting angry.
It was scary.

560
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,302
And his eyes...
They glowed.

561
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,905
- It's possible that his body
is fighting off the effect,

562
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,074
So it's hitting him slower.
- When it comes to rage,

563
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,442
That is not a good thing.

564
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,910
The longer you suppress
your emotions...

565
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:01,412
- The bigger the explosion.

566
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:04,081
- Considering what he can do,
how do we even stop him?

567
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:07,351
- A cold-gun would come in
real handy right about now.

568
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,420
- Hey.
- I'm just sayin'.

569
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:12,556
- None of us can stop barry.

570
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,959
Fortunately,
felicity knows someone who can.

571
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:19,630
I think you better call back
oliver queen.

572
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:22,800
We're gonna need
the arrow's help.

573
00:28:36,348 --> 00:28:37,848
- Is this your way of telling me

574
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,983
That you want satellite radio
for christmas?

575
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,654
Look, I am not mad at you.

576
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:46,857
- Good, 'cause there's no reason
you should be.

577
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:51,128
- Eddie, both you and the flash
care about protecting this city.

578
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,030
You would both
give your lives for it.

579
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:55,199
You're more alike
than you think, okay?

580
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:58,335
He's not the bad guy.

581
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:01,305
- How do you know
so much about him, iris?

582
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,177
- He got in touch with me
after I started the blog,

583
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:11,014
And I've seen him
a couple times.

584
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,883
- A couple times?

585
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,785
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

586
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,420
- Well, given the fact
that I think he's a hero,

587
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,855
And you want to put him in jail,

588
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,656
Do you really need
to ask that question?

589
00:29:19,658 --> 00:29:22,993
- How could you ever think
I would be okay with this?

590
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,507
- I heard you've been looking
for me.

591
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,581
- All this time,
you've been trying to catch me,

592
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,818
And I caught you first.

593
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,220
Guess you haven't read
your girlfriend's blog.

594
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,388
- Eddie, no!

595
00:29:56,628 --> 00:30:00,798
- Ooh, see I knew the arrow
was oliver queen.

596
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,467
I mean, I had it narrowed down
to, like, a list of 150 people,

597
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:06,170
But he was definitely
on that list.

598
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,906
- Do you have a way to stop
barry's rage-fest?

599
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,574
- I have an idea
about how to do that.

600
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,743
Joe, we're gonna need
your help.

601
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,912
- We need to find him first
before he hurts somebody.

602
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:16,647
- I have him.

603
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:20,217
Facial recognition picked him up
on a traffic camera downtown.

604
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:21,652
Oh, god.

605
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,358
- Eddie!

606
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,194
- Who the hell are you, huh?

607
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:31,562
You think
you can just come along

608
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:33,597
And get to have
whatever you want?

609
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,465
What gives you the right?

610
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,034
- What the hell
are you talking about?

611
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:40,070
- What are you doing?
What has happened to you?

612
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,271
- I feel fine.

613
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,873
- You are not fine.

614
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,509
- How would you know?
Because you write about me?

615
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,111
You don't know me!

616
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,047
You don't know who I am.

617
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,249
You never did.
- I know that you have

618
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:54,818
Risked your life
to help people,

619
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,854
To save them!
Someone who does that

620
00:30:56,856 --> 00:31:00,357
Does not suddenly turn around
and want to hurt people.

621
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,893
Please.

622
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,502
- Run!

623
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,438
- Eddie, run!

624
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:19,209
- You need to calm down.

625
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,812
- And you need to hold on.

626
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,086
- I just hope
they can turn barry back

627
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,587
Before he kills oliver.

628
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,788
- Me, I'd be more worried
about what oliver

629
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,523
Might have to do to barry.

630
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:35,759
- Barry has superpowers.
Oliver has a bow and arrow.

631
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,427
- Do you have any idea
how many people

632
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,663
Oliver has killed
with that bow and arrow?

633
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,266
- Recurve bow arrows can travel
up to 300 feet per second,

634
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,600
So, like, 200 miles an hour.

635
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:45,135
Barry can run three times
that fast.

636
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,770
- Whatever.
Oliver's been doing this

637
00:31:46,772 --> 00:31:48,705
A lot longer.
My money's on experience.

638
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,007
- My money's on speed.

639
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,508
- Please tell me
you're not actually

640
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,110
Having this conversation
right now.

641
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,449
- You missed.

642
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,084
- No.

643
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,920
- Aah!

644
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,998
- 2000 milligrams
of horse tranquilizer

645
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Should be hitting you
any time now.

646
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:47,331
Where you going?

647
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,799
We're not done!

648
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,811
- Is that all you got?

649
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,685
- Oliver, get up.

650
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,025
- Fool me once.

651
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,335
Ah... Ah... Ah!

652
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,709
- I still believe in you, barry.

653
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,819
- Is this even going to work?

654
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,287
- He just needs to see
the right colors.

655
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,790
Now, joe!

656
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:45,615
- Barry, you okay?

657
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,354
- Oh, this is going to be
a special kind of hangover.

658
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,464
- So...

659
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:02,866
It was a tie.

660
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,269
- Oliver...

661
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,537
I'm so sorry.

662
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,272
- It's not your fault.

663
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,742
But we do still have your
meta-human to take care of.

664
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,911
Anything left in the tank?

665
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,948
- Well, if not,
there's two of us, right?

666
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,950
- Right.

667
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,158
- You think this will stop me?

668
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,494
I will make you tear each other
to pieces!

669
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:31,995
You will all die
screaming with rage!

670
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,531
- Blah, blah, blah,
"no prison can hold me."

671
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,166
Heard it all before, pal.

672
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:37,601
Adios, prism.

673
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:39,469
- I liked "rainbow raider."

674
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,971
- Okay, you don't get
to pick the names.

675
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,739
- I have a prison like this.

676
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:45,809
Mine's on a nearly inhospitable
island in the north china sea,

677
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:49,045
But this works too.

678
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:53,316
My identity is a closely-guarded
secret known only to a few,

679
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:58,054
And if it were to get out,
will endanger my family,

680
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:01,057
My friends,
and it would embolden

681
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,860
My enemies to retaliate
at me through them.

682
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:06,396
- What oliver is trying to say

683
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,031
Is that he had a lovely time
working with you

684
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,233
And getting to know each of you,

685
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:13,136
And he can't wait
to do it again soon.

686
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:14,738
- Right.

687
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:19,075
- You know, it didn't sound like
that's what he was saying.

688
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:22,078
- I may not agree
with your methods, but...

689
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,781
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

690
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,550
- Hey.
If I had a dna sample

691
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,185
I was unable
to fully break down,

692
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:30,921
Do you think you could isolate
the genetic markers for me?

693
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:32,889
- Sure, what's the sample from?

694
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,158
- The canary's murder.

695
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,794
- Of course.

696
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:43,900
- Mr. Queen,
I met your father once.

697
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,002
Charity event.

698
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:49,072
One of the things
we spoke of was you.

699
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:54,411
I think he would be very proud
of the man you've become.

700
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:55,946
- Thank you.

701
00:36:55,948 --> 00:37:00,083
And please, call me oliver.

702
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,825
There is something off
about that guy.

703
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:18,768
- Captain singh approved
the task force.

704
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,504
You wanted me to believe
the flash was real.

705
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,673
Now I do.

706
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:25,642
I believe he's dangerous,

707
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:28,745
And I am going to take him in.

708
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:32,816
How do you feel about that?

709
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:35,385
- All I know...

710
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:37,354
Is how I feel about you.

711
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,203
Hey!
You guys heading home?

712
00:37:53,205 --> 00:37:54,904
- Yeah, we could use some javas
for the road.

713
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:56,006
- I will hook you up.

714
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:58,541
- Okay.
- Thank you.

715
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,347
- Um, so listen...

716
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:07,884
I'm really sorry
for what I said in the field

717
00:38:07,886 --> 00:38:09,653
And then last night
in the street.

718
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:12,856
I wish I could say it was all
because of whatever bivolo

719
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:15,125
Did to me, but I guess I had

720
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,394
More feelings bottled up
than I thought.

721
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,597
- You can always talk to me.

722
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:23,133
- Yeah.
Thank you.

723
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,769
And you were right,
I still have...

724
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,671
A lot to learn.

725
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:29,572
- There's one more thing...

726
00:38:29,574 --> 00:38:32,208
And you're not going to like it.

727
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,511
- Does it involve
you shooting me in the back?

728
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:38,048
- No.
No, the heart.

729
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,520
That's not going
to work out for you.

730
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,422
You need to let her go,

731
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:48,291
For both of your sakes.

732
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:59,502
Guys like us don't get the girl.

733
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,473
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:06,743
- This one's yours.
- Thank you.

735
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,311
- Oliver.

736
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,949
- Hi.
- Hi.

737
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,619
- How are you?
- Good, good.

738
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,855
It's been a long time.

739
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,094
- We never spoke after,
and I'm so sorry.

740
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:27,130
- No, I'm sorry.

741
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,866
I heard about your mother...

742
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:31,634
She loved you very much.

743
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,505
- She did.

744
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:40,310
- I should get going.
- All right.

745
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,549
- Who was that?
- Hmm?

746
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,589
Someone that I used to know.

747
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:54,591
- Hi, sweetheart.

748
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:58,128
Yes, I'm just getting you
a hot chocolate.

749
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,466
Mommy will be home soon.

750
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,344
- Got your message.

751
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,981
- I wanted you to know,
last night...

752
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,649
That wasn't me.

753
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,284
- Sure looked like you.

754
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:24,521
- Yeah. I was affected
by one of the meta-humans.

755
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,356
He messed with my head.

756
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:29,826
But I'm okay now, I promise.

757
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:32,295
- I defended you.

758
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:35,165
Everyone told me that you would
bring me nothing but danger.

759
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,301
My father, barry, eddie...

760
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:42,071
I didn't listen to them.
I never listened to them.

761
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:45,375
But now it's time I did.

762
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:49,045
Don't contact me anymore,
okay?

763
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,616
- Iris...

764
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:56,085
I'm sorry.

765
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:59,189
- Me too.

766
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,061
- ♪ carry your story ♪

767

- Look at that.
Better than an atm.

772
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:41,564
Anyone tell you not to hang out
under the freeway at night?

773
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:44,868
You're liable to get robbed.

774
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,302
You got the shakes, man?

775
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:49,172
What are you, tweaking,
or just cold?

776
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,182
I'm not cold.
