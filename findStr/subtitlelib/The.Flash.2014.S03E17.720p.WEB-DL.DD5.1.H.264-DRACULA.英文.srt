19
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,630
Previously on "The Flash" and "Supergirl"...

20
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:04,990
What just happened to him?

21
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:08,090
Wally has taken my place in the Speed Force.

22
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,660
It's okay, we're going home.

23
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,300
What Wally saw, it's gonna haunt him for a while.

24
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,850
I proposed because I thought it would save you.

25
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,870
- What does that mean? - I think we need some space.

26
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,520
I owe you the truth. My name is Mon-El.

27
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,840
I'm the former Prince of Daxam.

28
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,110
I deserve better than being lied to.

29
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,620
I've been looking for you.

30
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,190
Toodles!

31
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,820
*I'm singin' in the rain*

32
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,820
{\an1}I told you.

34
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,600
{\an1}Everything's better in song.

35
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,840
When you speak, it's just words.

36
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,520
But when you sing, you open up your soul

37
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,560
and let who you really are shine through.

38
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,030
Thanks, Mom.

39
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,370
I love you, my beautiful boy.

40
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,660
I love you too.

41
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,280
*I'm happy again*

42
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,870
*I'm laughing at clouds*

43
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,060
*So dark up above*

44
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,960
This...

45
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,690
Again?

46
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,480
What, are you gonna spend the rest of your life

47
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,960
sitting around on the couch? Come on.

48
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,760
You've been doing this for days. Let's do something.

49
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,810
- Let's go out. - No, man, I'm sorry.

50
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,370
I--I don't feel like going out.

51
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,080
What is it with you and musicals these days anyhow?

52
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,040
Everything's better in song.

53
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,030
Listen, dude, I know

54
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,240
you've been going through a tough time

55
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,920
since Iris broke off the engagement,

56
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,140
- or, I guess... - What?

57
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,040
Technically, since you broke off the engagement.

58
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,510
Whoever broke off the engagement,

59
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,190
it doesn't matter, I just--

60
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,740
I don't know, man. I want to help.

61
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,000
Nothing you can really do.

62
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,990
Really? I guess I'm just gonna

63
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,610
have to let Mr. Gene Kelly take over

65
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,150
'cause, Lord knows, I can't do anything about that.

66
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,390
- It's H.R. - Yeah.

67
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,290
BA
B.A.,

68
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,550
someone's coming through.

69
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,860
Could be Gypsy.

70
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,980
Could be, or it could be--

71
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,970
Supergirl?

72
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,920
Kara...

73
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,590
What happened to her?

74
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,620
We don't know,

75
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,270
but whoever did it has come to this world.

78
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,100
Her vitals are low.

79
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,570
How long has she been like this?

80
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,940
A few hours.

81
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,580
Okay, we need to find whoever did this to Kara

82
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,920
and punch him repeatedly until he reverses

83
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,470
whatever spell he put on her, and I get to punch him first.

84
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,920
Who are you exactly?

85
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,030
My name is Mon-El.

86
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,760
I'm--I'm Kara's...

87
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,470
friend.

88
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,790
We're more-- more than friend.

89
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,190
We've been kissing a lot.

90
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,260
Oh, she never mentioned she had a boyfriend.

91
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,250
It's a recent thing, so...

92
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,880
I thought you two broke up.

93
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,550
I tell you what, I know enough not to mention

94
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,320
the breakup between Barry and--uh--

95
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,800
- H.R. - Sorry.

96
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,590
Look, hey, whatever's going on between me and Kara,

97
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,360
I cannot leave her like this, okay?

98
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,900
- I need to get her back. - We will, I promise.

99
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,730
So what happened to her?

100
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,500
An alien prisoner escaped our custody.

101
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,090
He did something to her, put her in some kind of a coma.

102
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,300
And then he disappeared.

103
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,880
We tracked him here and followed.

104
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,660
Okay, but why would he come to this Earth?

105
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,900
Well, we believe...

106
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,040
for you.

107
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,970
- Me? Why? - We don't know.

108
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,390
But his last words before he disappeared

109
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,830
were about finding the fastest man alive.

110
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,620
Okay, well, clearly,

111
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,370
we're talking about a breacher here.

112
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,070
And if there's one thing I can do,

113
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,650
it's find breachers.

114
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,900
So what else can you tell us about this guy?

115
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,930
Not much.

116
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,440
It's like he just materialized out of thin air.

117
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,520
You mean like this clown just did?

118
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,330
I'm gonna go.

119
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,800
Wallace...

120
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,410
I understand what you've been through.

121
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,020
Stuck in the Speed Force, things you saw... I get it.

122
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,980
I also know that sometimes, the old adage is true.

123
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,480
When you get bucked from the horse,

124
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,790
best thing you can do...

125
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,850
get right back on the damn thing and ride, Wallace.

126
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,800
Ride!

127
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,760
Hello, Barry Allen.

128
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,480
- How do you-- - Know your name?

129
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,090
I know a lot of things.

130
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
And I can do a lot of things too.

131
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,020
Wally West made it here too.

132
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,170
This is exciting.

133
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,350
It's good of you to join the party, Kid Flash.

134
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,730
I'm happy to have you.

135
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,010
What do you want with Supergirl?

136
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,160
Same thing that I want with both of you.

137
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,670
To teach you all a lesson.

138
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,360
Is that all you got, Kid Flash?

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,850
I mean, you look a little scared.

140
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,650
And you're too slow.

141
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,970
Nighty-night, Flash.

142
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,550
{\an9}*Moon...*

143
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,760
What the hell?

144
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,750
*River*

145
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,970
*Wider than a mile*

146
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,490
{\an9}*I'm crossing...*

147
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,190
Kara?

148
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:46,220
{\an9}*You in style someday*

149
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:53,290
*Oh, dream maker*

150
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,220
*You heart breaker*

151
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,310
*Wherever you're going*

152
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:12,720
*I'm going your way*

153
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,740
*Two drifters*

154
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,620
*Off to see the world*

155
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:34,330
*There's such a lot of world to see*

156
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,620
*We're after*

157
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:48,700
*The same...rainbow's end*

158
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,050
*Waiting 'round the bend*

159
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,770
*My huckleberry friend*

160
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,040
*Moon river*

161
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:14,940
*And me...*

162
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,820
What a singer, huh?

163
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
- Yeah. - You know her?

164
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,350
Yeah, I do.

165
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,360
Ladies and gentlemen...

166
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,530
Barry?

167
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,820
Barry! It's you, thank Rao!

168
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,920
Oh, wait, it's really you, right?

169
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,310
- Yeah, this is me, yeah. - Good.

170
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,620
What is-- where the hell are we? What's going on?

171
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,290
I was hoping you could tell me

172
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,650
or maybe explain to me why I just pulled an Audrey Hepburn

173
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,380
and sang in a nightclub.

174
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,560
- Maybe we're dreaming? - The same dream?

175
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,780
Yeah, that's... what's the last thing

176
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,200
you remember before you got here?

177
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,040
I was at the D.E.O.

178
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,920
They had just brought in an alien prisoner.

179
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,380
He got loose, and--

180
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,280
It was really weird. He had this, um, red--

181
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,890
- Pocket handkerchief? - Yes!

182
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,340
I saw you on my Earth. You were in a coma.

183
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,070
Your boyfriend brought you to us.

184
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,440
He is not my boyfriend.

185
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,430
He--he's just a boy.

186
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,770
Who is not my friend.

187
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,440
- He's my nothing. - Okay.

188
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,380
All right, uh, well, whoever he is

189
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,320
said that this guy whammied you,

190
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,620
and then he escaped to my Earth,

191
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,460
he showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs,

192
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,270
I went after him to try to get him to wake you up--

193
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,840
- And then you got whammied. - Yeah.

194
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,330
- So where are we? - I don't know.

195
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,670
I mean, it could be a parallel dimension, or...

196
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,220
maybe just some elaborate illusion.

197
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,590
We just need to figure a way out.

200
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,840
- Yeah-- - I was kidding.

201
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,040
Okay, all right, well...

202
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,910
Come on. Let's...

203
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,990
You're a really good singer, by the way.

204
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,370
Hey, thanks. My sister says

205
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:40,240
I put the "Kara" in "Karaoke."

206
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,400
There you are!

207
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:43,780
Merlyn...

208
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,990
- Who? - Who?

209
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,700
Malcolm Merlyn.

210
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,220
Former head of the League of Assassins.

211
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,440
The what of the what?

212
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,800
What the hell you talking about, kid?

213
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,610
My name's Cutter Moran, I own this club,

214
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,250
and both of you work for me.

215
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,210
- We what now? - I pay you to sing,

216
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,510
not pepper me with questions.

217
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,180
And I hope you got something better in your songbook

218
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,890
than what you were belting out up there, blondie.

219
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,680
Hey! Don't call me blondie.

220
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,040
Hey, look, I don't know who you are--

221
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,480
obviously you're someone who's quick with a knife.

222
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,460
You have to excuse my friend.

223
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,090
He doesn't think before he talks.

224
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,690
Yeah, I had a cousin like that.

225
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,450
I had to slit his throat too.

226
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,280
Grady! Get these two set up.

227
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,500
And nothing I've heard before.

228
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,900
I want something original.

229
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,250
Barry, I don't have my powers.

230
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,350
Me neither.

231
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,030
Winn!

232
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,960
Winn, you're here too?

233
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,170
Ah! Who's Winn? The name is Grady.

234
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,430
I tickle the keys around here.

235
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,410
Say, you realize how he got the nickname "Cutter,"

236
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,800
- don't you? - No.

237
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,420
Because he likes to cut people.

238
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,970
You ask me, I think he's all talk.

239
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,630
Cisco... Not Cisco. Hello.

240
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,450
I pray that, one day, you do not find out

241
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,900
how very, very wrong you are, Pablo.

242
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,030
- Now go do your job. - All right.

243
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,890
You see, Grady doesn't know this, but one day,

244
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,280
I'm gonna be somebody.

245
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,420
I'm gonna be somebody, and it's gonna happen

246
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,020
right there on that stage.

247
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,450
You'll see. I just need my one shot.

248
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,600
It's just curiouser and curiouser.

249
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,620
Yeah, yeah, it's like "The Wizard of Oz."

250
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,910
- Yeah. - "And you were there,

251
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,070
- and you were there...." - Except, it's not really them.

252
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,930
They're all playing characters in a...

253
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,160
musical.

254
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,910
Barry, where are we?

255
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,100
I don't know.

256
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,850
Well, you knew what they say...

257
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,510
the show must go on!

258
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,170
Supergirl, I loved your rendition of "Moon River,"

259
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:22,980
such a beautiful song.

260
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,230
You were a little flat in places,

261
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,050
but I'm willing to let it slide just because you're so cute.

262
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,980
Hold on. What did you do to us?

263
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:29,740
Oh, nothing much.

264
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,130
Just put a little song in your heart.

265
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,710
Put a little--

266
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,990
Why did you bring us here?

267
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,100
I didn't bring you anywhere.

268
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,190
We're inside your heads.

269
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,830
You created this world.

270
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,830
And we got lucky because it could have been a war movie

271
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,520
or a--a space opera,

272
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,550
but thanks to your love of musicals,

273
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,020
with the countless times you watched, um, "Wizard of Oz"

274
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,040
- with your adoptive parents... - How did you know that?

275
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,460
And, you, all those rainy nights

276
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,160
watching Fred Astaire and Frank Sinatra with Mom.

277
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,500
Well, where else would we be?

278
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,100
All right, all right.

279
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,940
Swing and a miss.

280
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,480
I didn't tell you.

281
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,220
I'm not really here.

282
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,660
See, I'm out there in the real world.

283
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,900
Central City's mine for the taking.

284
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,200
Ah. We're gonna stop you.

285
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,860
Yeah!

286
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,710
You're welcome to try that.

287
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,790
If you can get out of here.

288
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,690
How do we get out of here?

289
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,340
You're in a movie musical.

290
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,570
So all you have to do is just follow the--

293
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,130
No, the--the script.

294
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,550
- Oh, yeah. - Script...

295
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,800
Reach the end of the plot,

296
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,180
and, presto chango, you get to go home.

297
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,360
One little detail, though, I should mention...

298
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,520
if you die in here, you die out there.

299
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,590
Lovely.

300
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,440
I've reached my limit with magical creeps.

301
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,800
In the meantime, I hope you're both ready

302
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,070
to get the rust off those pipes of yours.

303
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,650
- We're not singing for you! - No.

304
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,740
Uh, any--anymore, I mean.

305
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,820
Come on, now, maybe just one little

306
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,450
- fun opening number just to... - Leave your jacket on.

307
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,880
- kick things off! - Where did it go?

308
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,210
*Think of your fellow man*

309
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,460
- Stop that. - It's not happening.

310
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,790
*Lend him a helping hand*

311
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,490
- It's not gonna work. - We're not singing!

312
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,400
*Put a little love in your heart*

313
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,310
*You see it's getting late*

314
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,430
*Oh, please don't hesitate*

315
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,890
*Put a little love in your heart*

316
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,010
*And the world *-

317
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,800
- *The world... * - *Will be a better place*

318
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,900
- *And the world * - *The world*

319
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,000
*Will be a better place*

320
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,810
- *For you * - *And me*

321
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,150
*You just wait*

322
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,470
*And see, yeah*

323
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,770
*If you want the world to know*

324
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,740
*We won't let hatred grow*

325
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,730
*Put a little love in your heart*

326
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,380
*And the world*

327
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,490
*Will be a better place*

328
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,050
*And the world*

329
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,740
*Will be a better place*

330
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,700
- *For you * - *For you*

331
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,410
- *And me * - *And me*

332
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,570
*You just wait and see*

333
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,220
*You better take a good look around*

334
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,090
*Oh, if you're looking down*

335
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,180
*Put a little love in your heart*

336
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,590
*And the world*

337
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,010
*Will be a better place*

338
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,930
- *All the world * - *All the world*

339
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,180
*Will be a better place*

340
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,040
- *For you * - *For you*

341
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,740
- *And me * - *And me*

342
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,490
*You just wait and see*

343
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,730
*Put a little love in your heart*

344
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,430
*Put a little love, put a little love*

345
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,360
*Put a little love, put a little love*

346
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,230
*Put a little love in your heart*

347
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,680
*Put a little love in your heart*

348
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,190
*Put a little love*

349
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,270
*Put a little love in your heart*

350
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,000
*Come on and...*

351
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,090
*Put a little love in your heart...*

352
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,650
Where'd he go?

353
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,760
I don't know.

354
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,230
Come on, let's find him.

355
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,260
- He's gone. - Yup.

356
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,380
So what do we do now?

357
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,060
I don't know, I mean, I guess we just...

358
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,090
We do what he says, right?

359
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,810
We have to figure out what the plot of the musical is,

360
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,200
- and we follow the story. - Okay, uh, so...

361
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,040
What do we know so far?

362
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,350
We're singers.

363
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,690
And apparently we work for a gangster.

364
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,120
Yes, who wants us to perform for him.

365
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,110
I mean, honestly, it's pretty straightforward.

366
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,350
- Right? - Yeah.

367
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,790
Hello.

368
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,130
Hi! I miss being bulletproof.

369
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,150
You're coming with us.

370
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,110
Says who?

371
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,010
Says me.

372
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,790
Barry, are you okay?

373
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,530
Oh, please stop yelling.

374
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,140
I'm not yelling.

375
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,410
Wait, where are we?

376
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,260
I don't know.

377
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
All right, well, I'm sure everybody at S.T.A.R. Labs

378
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,740
is working on getting us out of this.

379
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,830
Yeah, I'm glad they brought me to your Earth.

380
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,600
Mon-El seems like he really cares about you.

381
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,440
Mon-El only cares about himself.

382
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,990
He lied to me about who he really is

383
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,320
for nine months.

384
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,770
I can't shake it.

385
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,570
I thought it was gonna be something special

386
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,200
like what you have with Iris.

387
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,230
That is...

388
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,100
off track.

389
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,390
I'm sorry.

390
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,960
I asked her to marry me.

391
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,530
You did? That's great.

392
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,360
Did she not say yes?

393
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,050
Oh, she said yes, but I guess I did it

394
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,310
for the wrong reason, and, I mean, I love her,

395
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,440
but I was trying to change the future.

396
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,590
Then I pushed her away so I could focus on saving her,

397
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,060
and it's just a mess now.

398
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,340
Everything's so simple when I'm running.

399
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,560
Or flying.

400
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,140
Shut up!

401
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,230
Both of you.

402
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:36,190
Stein?

403
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,020
Who--who's Stein?

404
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,960
Right.

405
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,340
This them?

406
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,530
Yeah.

407
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,890
Do you know who I am?

408
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,340
Not Joe West, I'm guessing.

409
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,320
Digsy. Digsy Foss.

410
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,270
I run this town.

411
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,330
So you're the mayor?

412
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,560
The mayor may have gotten the vote...

413
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,350
but I got the power.

414
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,240
I got a situation...

415
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,290
that you two are gonna help me with.

416
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,060
We would love to help you with it.

417
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,270
Really love to.

418
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,060
My daughter, Millie...

419
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,110
She's missing.

420
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,220
Last she was seen,

421
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,590
she was heading into Cutter Moran's place.

422
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,600
Have you seen her in there?

423
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,390
- Millie, did you say? - Yeah. Why?

424
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,350
We haven't seen her. I haven't seen her

425
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,550
- I haven't seen her. - Yeah, we...

426
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,270
She's the only thing that is good and decent about my life.

427
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,660
If anything happened to her,

428
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,780
this town will run red with blood.

429
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,140
Starting with yours.

430
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,830
We wouldn't want that, now, right?

431
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,540
So, um, how can we help you?

432
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,550
You two sing for Cutter.

433
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,000
- We sure do. - Yes, we do.

434
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,460
You could poke around and see if you can find her.

435
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,960
So are you gonna do this for me?

436
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,380
What do we do?

437
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,940
Follow the script.

438
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,040
We're gonna find her... Sir.

439
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,590
Good.

440
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,600
Okay. This is the place.

441
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,520
Apartment 4B.

442
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,320
This is where we can find Iris?

443
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,530
- Millie. - Millie, right.

444
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,070
Yeah, she's in there, all right.

445
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,870
Now, you two listen to me.

446
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,140
Don't you go telling anyone I showed you this.

447
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh, yeah, we promise.

448
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,430
Word to the wise.

449
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,170
You go digging around in this dirt...

450
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,400
you might not like what you find.

451
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,770
Okay.

452
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,560
Okay, so remember, she might look like Iris,

453
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,100
but she is not Iris.

454
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,940
I know. This is gonna be weird.

455
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,970
Yeah, tell me about it.

456
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,430
I'm glad we haven't seen someone that looks like Mon-El.

457
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,940
I'd probably just punch him in the face for the fun of it.

458
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,710
Oh, my God!

459
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,030
That's her. Sounds like she's in trouble.

460
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,450
Here, stand back, I'm gonna kick the door in.

461
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,930
You stand back, I'll kick the door in.

462
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:14,980
Well, I didn't mean, like, a gender thing.

463
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,640
- I just wanted to kick it in-- - Barry!

464
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,820
All right, together. All right?

465
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,850
- One, two... - Three!

466
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,410
What the hell is going on?

467
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,160
All right, you caught us.

468
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,770
We're in love.

469
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,600
Ugh, gross.

470
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,240
Guys, we have a problem.

471
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,890
Well, another problem.

472
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,290
The Speed Force levels in Barry's cells

473
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,810
have been severely depleted,

474
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,250
as has the amount of solar radiation in Kara's body.

475
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,760
What exactly does that mean?

476
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,510
They're being drained.

477
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,180
The guy who did this to them...

478
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,400
I think he's stealing their powers.

480
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,060
Power up.

482
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,950
We gotta bring him in.

483
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,680
No, not we-- me.

484
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,740
I'm the reason Barry got whammied.

485
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,350
We win and we lose as a team.

486
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,550
I'm coming with you.

487
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,890
I'm coming too.

488
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,790
Look, John, uh,

489
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,040
I respect this whole special agent situation

490
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,800
you got going on, but this problem right here

491
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,040
needs someone with...

492
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,850
Green skin and sick-ass cape.

493
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,050
Call me the Martian Manhunter.

494
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,780
I think you'll find that John's a lot more

495
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,550
than just a pretty face.

496
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,730
Guys!

497
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,200
Hello.

498
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,670
Also, Barry and Kara's vitals are all over the place.

499
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,090
Let's go.

500
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,760
All right.

501
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,460
Hello, friends!

503
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,250
Kid Flash.

504
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,850
Oh, I'm so glad you could join the party.

505
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,510
I'm such a huge fan of your work, but I have to say,

506
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,540
recently, your work's been a bit off.

507
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,390
You know what I'm talking about?

508
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,410
I think maybe it's just that you're a little scared

509
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,270
from what happened in the Speed Force.

510
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,280
Is that it?

511
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,700
No,

512
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,460
and I'm not afraid of anything.

513
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,350
Prove it.

514
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,950
Uh, Cisco, they're headed towards 4th and Aspen.

515
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,130
Got it.

516
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,290
This way.

517
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,520
All right, Jonn,

518
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,570
how do you feel about a little one-two combo?

519
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,050
I'm gonna open a breach, you be ready to hit something

520
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,510
really hard on the B-side.

521
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,250
Hitting hard, I can do.

522
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,650
Wally, get ready to do the same thing

523
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,840
on the ground level.

524
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,830
Copy.

525
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,970
Now!

526
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,620
Nighty-night.

527
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,610
Hey, who are you?

528
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,290
Your names, now.

529
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,010
I'm Kara. This is Barry.

530
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,310
We're singers at your dad's nightclub.

531
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,860
Millie, your dad thinks you've been kidnapped.

532
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,940
Well, clearly he's mistaken.

533
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,450
He really wants you to come home.

534
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,460
Listen, I am never going back there.

535
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,700
Why not?

536
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
"There's no place like home."

537
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,610
Tommy Moran...

538
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,700
is my home.

539
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,650
And besides, if our geezers ever caught wind of this,

540
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,960
they'd go to war.

541
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,360
It'd be the end of more than just us, huh?

542
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,960
Yeah, Tommy's right.

543
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,610
Our fathers hate each other.

544
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,720
Our love is forbidden.

545
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,330
This is just like "West Side Story."

546
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,980
I was thinking more "Fantasticks," But...

547
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,600
Look, the point is...

548
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,650
We ain't telling nobody nothing.

549
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,690
And neither are you, capisce?

550
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,090
"Capisce."

551
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,150
Can you give us a second?

552
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,170
Sure.

553
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,990
Okay, look, he says we need to follow the script.

554
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,110
We're in a musical.

555
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,240
So I think if we convince them to tell their fathers that

556
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,910
they're in love, maybe that'll get us out of here.

557
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:53,270
And back home to being...

558
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,610
single, yay...

559
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,080
At least we'll be single together.

560
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,120
Has saying that ever made anyone feel better?

561
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,240
Debatable.

562
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,500
Okay, so look...

563
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,150
Your fathers aren't perfect, right?

564
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,090
Love isn't perfect.

565
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,480
No, but you can't let your love for somebody

566
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,340
cause you to be afraid of what might happen.

567
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,090
You gotta take the good with the bad, no matter what.

568
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,030
- Right. - And that includes...

569
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,140
telling your fathers how you two feel about each other.

570
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,740
All right, you make a convincing argument.

571
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,600
- You do. - We'll do it.

572
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,870
We'll tell them about us, right?

573
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,170
- Well, we should go now. - Okay.

574
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,420
Gee, thanks, kid.

575
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,900
- For you. - Thank you.

576
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,140
Okay.

577
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,310
Convincing people in musicals is...

578
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,240
- really easy. - Yeah.

579
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,730
Let's hope getting out of one is just as easy.

580
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,220
Digsy!

581
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,300
She's back!

582
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,580
Thank God you're safe.

583
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,520
Oh, of course I'm safe.

584
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:00,240
Barry and Kara told me that you sent them to find me.

585
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,540
We were concerned.

586
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,350
Dads, there's no reason to be concerned.

587
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,190
"Dads"?

588
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,460
You got a problem with that?

589
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,900
No.

590
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,550
I love musicals, so...

591
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,790
Okay...

592
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,170
Look, Dads, there's something that...

593
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,940
I need to tell you.

594
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm in love!

595
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,160
Who is the, uh-- the lucky boy?

596
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,030
Tommy Moran.

597
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,670
You--you mean Cutter Moran's kid?

598
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,110
Dad, look, we're in love.

599
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,400
The hell you are.

600
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,990
He's a hooligan! His father's a hooligan.

601
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,410
- His mother is-- - Hey!

602
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,730
Not in front of the girl.

603
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,700
And you're not loving that boy.

604
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,800
Have you lost your mind?

605
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,480
She is the daughter of my enemy.

606
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,520
Digsy Foss is a dirty, rotten scoundrel,

607
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,230
and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree--

608
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,570
Dad, if you just let me explain.

609
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,280
There's nothing to explain, Tommy.

610
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,080
I knew you were keeping something from me.

611
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,920
I never imagined it was something like this!

612
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,710
She isn't your little girl anymore.

613
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,220
Well, she isn't.

614
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,680
She's an incredibly brave, strong woman.

615
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,740
One look, and you can see that.

616
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,570
And she wants to be with him.

617
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,110
No matter how scared she was to tell you,

618
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,500
no matter how dangerous it is to be with him,

619
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,850
all that matters is, they're together.

620
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,660
And when you find a love like that, well...

621
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,320
you gotta hold on to it.

622
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,140
No matter who's trying to stop you.

623
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,370
That's clear to me now.

624
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,530
I think you're being a little tough on your son.

625
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,720
Excuse me?

626
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,210
Well, it's obvious why he didn't tell you right away.

627
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,240
I mean, look at the way you're reacting.

628
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,640
Maybe if you just listen and-- and hear his reasons

629
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,370
and try to see things from his point of view...

630
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,840
maybe--maybe you'd understand why he didn't tell you...

631
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,750
before now.

632
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,490
Baby doll, it's just--

633
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,150
you'll never understand what it means to be a father.

634
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,800
Millie, my darling, we've always taken care of you.

635
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,970
We just want you to be happy.

636
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,340
*Velvet, I can wish you*

637
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,840
*For the collar of your coat*

638
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:38,080
*And fortune smiling all along your way*

639
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,150
*But more I cannot wish you*

640
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,470
*Than to wish you find your love*

641
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:51,220
*Your own true love this day*

642
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,870
*Mansions, I can wish you*

643
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,470
*Seven footmen, all in red*

644
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:04,130
*And calling cards upon a silver tray*

645
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,840
*But more I cannot wish you*

646
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,280
*Than to wish you find your love*

647
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,320
*Your own true love this day*

648
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,850
*Standing there*

649
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,460
*Gazing at you*

650
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,110
*With the sheep's eye*

651
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,390
*And a licorice tooth*

652
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,510
*Music I can wish you*

653
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,150
*Merry music while you're young*

654
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,300
*And wisdom when your hair*

655
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,990
*Has turned to gray*

656
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,140
*But more I cannot wish you*

657
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,910
*Than to wish you find your love*

658
00:27:54,910 --> 00:28:01,590
*Your own true love this day*

659
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,980
*With a sheep's eye*

660
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,820
*And a licorice tooth*

661
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,700
*And the strong arms*

662
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,240
*To carry you away*

663
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,770
*Away*

664
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,590
*And the strong arms*

665
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:27,090
*To carry you away*

666
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,430
Thanks for telling us the truth, baby.

667
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,440
I love you both so much.

668
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,100
We love you.

669
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,640
Thanks.

670
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,850
Okay...

671
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,550
So what do you want to do?

672
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,390
Gather up the boys.

673
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,600
- We're going to war. - I had a feeling.

674
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,190
I appreciate your honesty, son.

675
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,580
Thanks, Dad.

676
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,680
Come here.

677
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,650
Get the boys.

678
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,260
We are going to war.

679
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,660
Well, well, well...

680
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,110
If it isn't the two people

681
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,110
I was hoping would visit me the most.

682
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,290
Fix them. Now.

683
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,500
I'm sorry. I can't.

684
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,980
If you ever want to get out of that cell,

685
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,820
that's exactly what you're gonna do.

686
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,990
You don't get it.

687
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,390
You don't understand, big guy.

688
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,470
That's just not how it works.

689
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,320
My powers don't work that way.

690
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,140
What do you mean? You're the one who did this to them.

691
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,790
Yes, but...

692
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,960
they are the only ones that are in control

693
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,510
of what happens to them now,

694
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,490
as are the two of you.

695
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:59,210
Us? What does that mean?

696
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,520
How much...

697
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,960
do you love him, Iris?

698
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,930
And you, Mon-El, how much do you love her?

699
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,270
So the question is:

700
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:12,300
is that strong enough to save them?

701
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,490
You want Kara and Barry back from the world they're in,

702
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,160
you can go get them yourselves.

703
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,270
You have that power.

704
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,460
How?

705
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:22,800
Ah, I can't tell you.

706
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,300
Sorry, you gotta figure it out yourself.

707
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,990
Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna just chill

708
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,530
in this wonderfully decorated little cell of yours.

709
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,090
Bye, guys!

710
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,560
Good luck. Love will find a way.

711
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,650
You can do it.

712
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,170
Power of love and all that.

713
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,050
What do we do now?

714
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,220
We got-- we got Millie and Tommy

715
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,610
to tell their fathers that they're in love.

716
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,160
Which, I know we're in a musical and everything,

717
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,530
but seeing Mon-El in love with someone else was--

718
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,340
It was hard to watch. I know.

719
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,800
Anyway, I mean, what are we...

720
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,780
supposed to do? What do you think this...

721
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,200
Music Meister needs us to do now?

722
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,260
Ah, there you are!

723
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,190
You two ready?

724
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,500
Ready for...

725
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,290
For rehearsal, you dolt.

726
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,360
Mr. Moran told me that you got more songs

727
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,690
in your repertoire.

728
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,310
We have to finish the musical.

729
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,050
- Yeah. - Uh, do you...

730
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,240
do you happen to know anything original?

731
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,970
As a matter of fact,

732
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,000
I've been working on something all day.

733
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,780
- Things really are easier in musicals. - Yeah.

734
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,160
All right.

735
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,260
*At times like these*

736
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,520
*When life is getting me down*

737
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,120
*And the world seems like it's gonna end-ship*

738
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,930
*There's at least one power*

739
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,680
*That we both still have*

740
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,440
*And that's the power of...*

741
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,090
*Friendship*

742
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,060
Yeah, that's exactly what I was gonna say.

743
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,520
Yeah, it's an easy rhyme.

744
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,790
*I'm your super friend*

745
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,080
*Your super friend*

746
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,750
*I'll be there in the nick of time*

747
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,410
*If you're ever in a spot*

748
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,600
*And if you're not there in time*

749
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,940
*You can just go back in time and give it another shot*

750
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,590
I'm actually not supposed to do that anymore.

751
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,850
Oh, okay.

752
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,110
Sing!

753
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,230
*I'm your super friend*

754
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,780
*Super friend*

755
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,690
*When you need a compliment*

756
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,660
*I can rattle off a dozen*

757
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,110
*For instance, I have to say, I'm not impressed..*

758
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,700
*By your more famous cousin*

759
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,700
Thank you! No one ever says that.

760
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,770
Oh, he's all, like, "I'm Superman."

761
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,900
- That's a really good impression. - Thanks.

762
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:45,940
*I'm your super friend*

763
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,260
*Super friend*

764
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,800
*When it comes to buddies, pal, you're the best*

765
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,750
*I love you more than the lightning bolt*

766
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,480
*I wear on my chest*

767
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,720
*If you're ever sad...*

768
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,840
*I'll bring you flowers*

769
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,320
*And you can list soprano as one of your powers*

770
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,370
- *If you're ever broke * - *I've got the cash*

771
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,350
- *On my couch * - *You're welcome to crash*

772
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,270
*And if you ever need a hand*

773
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,290
*I'll be there in a flash*

774
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,610
- Barry! - That was funny.

775
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,310
*I'm your super...*

776
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,010
*That has a double meaning*

777
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,280
*Friend*

778
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,190
Hello, my friend.

779
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,050
It will be a cold day in hell

780
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:37,010
before our daughter marries any son of yours.

781
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,190
Like he said.

782
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,690
A cold, cold day.

783
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,300
You took the words right out of my mouth.

784
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,920
Come on.

785
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,650
Stop!

786
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,750
Barry!

787
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,570
Oh, my God.

788
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,270
- What's wrong? - I think we're losing them.

789
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,810
Can you stop it?

790
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,230
Not if I don't know why.

791
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,830
What are we gonna do?

792
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,720
We need to go to whatever world they're in.

793
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,590
How are we gonna do that?

794
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,920
Look, he said, if we loved them enough

795
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,660
that we could save them, wherever they are.

796
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,350
Cisco, you can vibe us there.

797
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,660
I don't think it works that way.

798
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,650
You sent me into the Speed Force.

799
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,170
You sent Barry and Wally into the future.

800
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,210
You can do this too.

801
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,520
What is she talking about?

802
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,490
- What's a vibe? - I'll explain later.

803
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,810
Come on, just... grab on to my shoulders.

804
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,370
Let's hope this works.

805
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,620
Barry, Barry...

806
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,340
Kara...

807
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,120
Barry!

808
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,180
Kara!

809
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,940
- Oh, no. - No.

810
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,040
Hey, it's me.

811
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,770
It's Iris, I'm here. Hi.

812
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,650
Stay with me. I'm gonna get you out.

813
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,860
There's no time.

814
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,780
We have to go.

815
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,180
We have to get them out!

816
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,720
Come on, Barry. Barry!

817
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,810
No!

818
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,370
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

819
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,120
I forgive you.

820
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,020
I love you.

821
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,700
No, Barry, Barry, you're gonna be okay.

822
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,320
I love you.

823
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,130
Iris?

824
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,430
Mon-El?

825
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,510
They're back!

826
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:24,590
Bravo! Round of applause!

827
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,930
Standing O. It was so good!

828
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,610
I loved it. That was a hell of a show.

829
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,830
And you two...

830
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,560
I guess your love really was strong enough after all.

831
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,230
Beautiful.

832
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,030
Man, how did you get out of the cell?

833
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,950
Cisco, do you really think that cell

834
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:39,820
is gonna just, like, hold me?

835
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
No, I'm sorry-- what's going on?

836
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,860
Why did you do this to us?

837
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,410
I did it because I believe in the good guys.

838
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,300
I told you when we first met.

839
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,450
It was to teach all of you a lesson.

840
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,580
'Cause I see everything,

841
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,370
and I saw two people...

842
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,220
with two broken hearts.

843
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,240
So the lesson was...

844
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,580
Love, Supergirl.

845
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,320
Love is about...

846
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,510
letting yourself be saved.

847
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,940
It's not just about saving other people.

848
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,600
Even if you are superheroes.

849
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,080
Anyway, I'm sorry that I had to, like,

850
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,150
mess with you a little bit.

851
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,990
I was just trying to get you to play the game,

852
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,170
do the song and dance.

853
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,690
Are you, like, from another--

854
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,400
Earth-multi-verse-- universe, something?

855
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,640
Yeah, you...

856
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,800
you wouldn't even understand where I come from.

857
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,570
Wait, I'm sorry, that's it?

858
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,320
You're just gonna teach somebody else a lesson?

859
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,100
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

860
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,230
*Think of your fellow man*

861
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,480
*Lend him a helping hand*

862
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,350
*Put a little love in your heart*

863
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,310
Wait, so, let me get this straight.

864
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,260
You got whammied by some guy named...

865
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,580
Music Meister.

866
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,380
Damn, Barry, I'd have paid good money

867
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,810
to see you singing and dancing.

868
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,740
No.

869
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,840
Well, he's holding out on you

870
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,200
because Barry has an amazing voice.

871
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,660
He does!

872
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,070
I've actually seen him sing.

873
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,070
What? You have?

874
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,260
How have we not made a GIF of that?

875
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,230
Well, technically, I'm not even the only one here

876
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,460
who can sing.

877
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,380
- Thank you, B.A. - What?

878
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,520
I was talking about Kara.

879
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,780
Wait, shh--oh, you too?

880
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,110
Kara. Of course Kara can sing.

881
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,700
Well, her name is Supergirl.

882
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,330
It's kind of implied, right?

883
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,910
Well, we better be getting going.

884
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,520
I promised Kara's sister we'd get her back in one piece.

885
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,960
We couldn't have done this without you.

886
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,730
- Thank you. - Thank you.

887
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:41,340
How are you guys doing?

888
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,830
Yeah, I think we'll be okay.

889
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,140
Although, if you lie to me again,

890
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,980
I will drop a mountain on you.

891
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,290
You mean figuratively?

892
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,590
No, I mean, geologically.

893
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,680
Okay.

894
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,970
What about you guys?

895
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,740
We'll see.

896
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,310
You didn't change anything when I moved in with Cisco.

897
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:18,120
I, um, couldn't bring myself to do it.

898
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,990
You know, we've been through a lot these last three years,

899
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,250
but, um...

900
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,480
getting stuck in a musical?

901
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,820
Music Meister

902
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,260
said that, you know, I could've been anything,

903
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,930
that I created that world because...

904
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,220
You were watching them.

905
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,720
Because of us.

906
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,240
My mom used to always say that musicals have the power

907
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,940
to make everything better.

908
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,710
Did it work?

910
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:05,640
*Can't say how the days will unfold*

911
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:11,190
*Can't change what the future may hold*

912
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,870
*But I want you in it*

913
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,110
*Every hour, every minute*

914
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:23,970
*This world can race by far too fast*

915
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,090
*Hard to see while it's all flying past*

916
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,050
*But it's clear now*

917
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,340
*When you're standing here now*

918
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,090
*I am meant to be*

919
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,760
*Wherever you are next to me*

920
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,040
*All I want to do*

921
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,660
*Is come runnin' home to you*

922
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,060
*Come runnin' home to you*

923
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:01,190
*And all my life, I promise to*

924
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,920
*Keep runnin' home to you*

925
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,530
*Keep runnin' home to you*

926
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,620
*And I could see it*

927
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,910
*Right from the start, right from the start*

928
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,170
*That you would be*

929
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,990
*Be my light in the dark, light in the dark*

930
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:32,640
*Oh, you gave me no other choice*

931
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,670
*But to love you*

932
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,560
*All I want to do*

933
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,610
*Is come runnin' home to you*

934
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,260
*Come runnin' home to you*

935
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:57,300
*And all my life I promise to*

936
