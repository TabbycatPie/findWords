7
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,410
My name is Oliver Queen.

8
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:04,140
After five years in hell,

9
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,240
I have come home with only one goal--

10
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,120
to save my city.

11
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,140
Now others have joined my crusade.

12
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,240
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

13
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,630
To the rest of Starling City, I am someone else.

14
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,870
I am something else.

15
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,320
Previously, on "Arrow"...

16
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,020
I want you to take my place.

17
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,760
I want you to become the next Ra's Al Ghul.

18
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,380
Maseo...

19
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,240
My master sees something in you.

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,360
Don't let your recalcitrants take any more lives.

21
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:34,900
Oliver...

23
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,940
We have to stop this guy

24
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,120
before he puts arrows in any more criminals.

25
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,980
Or before he starts putting them in innocent people.

26
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,940
Captain, I think you're letting your

27
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,830
personal feelings towards the Arrow cloud your judgment.

28
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,970
Maybe I'm seeing things more

29
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,370
clearly than I have for the last few years.

30
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,280
Enough, both of you! I am tired--

31
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,730
This is Captain Lance. City hall, shots fired.

32
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:05,140
Suspect on the move, I need ESU

33
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,650
and an ambulance, now!

34
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,120
- Are you ok?! - I'm fine!

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,510
We have confirmation that Mayor Castle

36
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,710
was pronounced dead at the scene.

38
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,170
Palmer Technologies CEO Ray Palmer

39
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,280
was taken to Starling General Hospital

40
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,810
where he is listed in critical condition.

41
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,290
I tried to call Felicity earlier, she's not answering her phone.

42
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,740
SCPD Captain Quentin Lance was present for the attack,

43
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,840
and had this to say on the incident--

45
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,210
I just requested a first degree murder warrant for the Arrow.

46
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,030
And reinstated the Anti-vigilante Task Force with

47
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,720
shoot to kill orders if necessary. Excuse me.

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,610
Why would the Arrow suddenly decide to assassinate the mayor?

49
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,870
I don't know. But I should have trusted my first instinct,

50
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,840
that this man is a killer and a criminal.

51
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,630
If I had, Mayor Castle might still be alive.

52
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,590
No more questions.

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,730
He could be right.

54
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,600
Oliver, don't even start to think like that.

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,160
We have to deal with the problem that's at hand.

56
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,360
The murders are being orchestrated by one of Ra's lieutenants.

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,830
Maseo Yamashiro.

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,160
Ok, you sound like you know him.

59
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,190
I thought I did, a lifetime ago.

60
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,580
The man's a stranger to me now.

61
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,260
Oliver, the question is,

62
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,150
where do we find this stranger now?

63
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,770
I know someone who can help with that.

64
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,900
Who are those men?!

65
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,350
I--I don't know.

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,940
Then why are we running away from them?

67
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,540
Shado?

68
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,230
What?

69
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,780
How did you know my sister?

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,600
Your--um, your sister?

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,480
My twin. How do you know Shado?

72
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,460
Oliver...

73
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,400
It's a long story. My--my friend and I

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,880
are in a little bit of trouble,

75
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,180
and, uh, we were wondering

76
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,120
if you could help us get off the streets.

77
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,880
What's going on?

78
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,550
It's also a long story!

79
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,070
Can you help us?

80
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,900
Ok, listen up. The suspect is armed and dangerous.

81
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,370
- No warning shots! - Yes, sir.

82
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,990
Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty?

83
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,320
He was on that rooftop, Laurel, I saw it with my own eyes.

84
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,460
- He's being framed. - By a "Copycat."

85
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,730
Which wouldn't be happening if he wasn't dressed up

86
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,230
like Robin Hood in the first place.

87
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,480
That's not fair! You don't understand

88
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,910
what's happening here and I need you to trust me.

89
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,240
I used to.

90
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Who is he?

91
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,620
Just tell me his name, or I'll--

92
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,650
What, Dad? You'll charge me as an accessory?

93
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,010
I'll do what needs to be done,

94
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,470
'cause this has to end.

95
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,060
And it has to end tonight.

96
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,140
I am the biggest idiot in the world

97
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,690
for breaking up with you.

98
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,640
Remember the last time we did this?

99
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,360
We were going to run away together.

100
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,830
Why don't we?

101
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,110
Roy.

102
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,070
Things are just complicated with Oliver right now.

103
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,170
Ra's Al Ghul complicated?

105
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,810
Oh, my God.

106
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,360
In the wake of the attacks,

108
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,660
Captain Lance has issued an arrest warrant

109
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,630
for the vigilante known as the Arrow,

111
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,910
as the largest manhunt in the city's history is now underway.

112
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,180
Captain Lance confirmed

113
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,750
that arrest warrants have also been issued

114
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,080
for each of the Arrow's accomplices.

115
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,420
Ray?

116
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,680
How are you?

117
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,800
Well, you're here, so I'm great.

118
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,900
Mr. Palmer, how are you feeling?

119
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,920
You have a not so good look on your face.

120
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,570
You see his face?

121
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,210
I've got some bad news. During the surgery

122
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,990
to remove the arrow, you developed a thrombus.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,920
A blood clot.

124
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,160
If left untreated, it could cause an ischemic stroke.

125
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,340
Well, then maybe we should treat it.

126
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,070
It's not that simple.

127
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,030
Your injuries have left you very weak.

128
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,580
A craniotomy could end up doing more harm than good.

129
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,660
And by harm, you mean...

130
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,080
Brain damage, at best.

131
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,430
At worst...

132
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,400
So we are saying basically that

133
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,010
if we have the surgery now, I could die,

134
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,700
and...if I wait and the clot moves,

135
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,470
I could die.

136
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,160
What if I told you

137
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,970
that I invented a bunch of teeny tiny robots

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,340
that were capable of entering my bloodstream,

139
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,080
traveling to the clot, and shrinking it,

140
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,140
all without damaging my brain

141
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,930
or any other organ in my body?

142
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,820
I'd say you need a psych eval.

143
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,080
Ok.

144
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,430
But after, we go to my lab,

145
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,380
get the nano-tech, inject it in me,

146
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,450
and publish the results in the "New England Journal of Medicine."

147
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,250
Ah, I'm sorry, but that's simply not possible.

148
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,760
Uh, I invented the tech, it's possible.

149
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,270
Starling General has a very

150
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,520
strict policy against experimental procedures.

151
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,160
Wait, there is a procedure that could save his life,

152
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,760
and you're saying you won't perform it?

153
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,130
I'm saying I can't perform it.

154
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,270
The hospital won't permit the use of an experimental

155
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,260
or untested technology.

156
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,550
How do you know your invention won't kill you?

157
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,830
I don't.

158
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,050
It's a risk.

159
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,220
I'm very sorry,

160
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,060
but there's really nothing I can do.

161
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,410
We'll figure something out.

162
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,830
Ray Palmer.

163
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,380
Even in a hospital bed,

164
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,820
you're the most handsome man I've ever seen.

165
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,920
Can you give us a minute?

166
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,430
Mom!

167
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,660
I heard what happened,

168
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,400
so I caught the first flight out of Vegas!

169
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,480
So tell me, what did the doctor say?

170
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,700
Absolutely nothing good.

171
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,480
Ok, ok.

172
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,740
What?

173
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,210
At least you finally have a boyfriend.

174
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,660
Mom!

175
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,900
How did you know I was still in Starling?

176
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,330
Laurel.

177
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,970
I need your help, Nyssa.

178
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,050
Maseo Sarab-- is also in Starling.

179
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,640
He's behind the murders the Arrow is suspected of.

180
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,610
Sarab does my father's bidding in an effort to force you

181
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,760
to do the same and take his rightful place as his heir.

182
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,070
And do you feel betrayed by that decision?

183
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,430
Not so much that I'd betray him in turn by helping you.

184
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,230
People are dying, Nyssa!

185
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,010
And what makes you think that's any concern of mine?

186
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,080
Sara.

187
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,110
What would she want you to do?

188
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,000
I have Maseo's location.

189
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,330
A building called Magnuson Plaza.

190
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,440
The company that owns that building

191
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,200
went belly up a few months back.

192
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,260
Apparently the League has been using it as a safe house

193
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,960
and staging ground for its attacks.

194
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,510
How'd you find this out?

195
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,700
I am daughter of the demon.

196
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,390
Your primary concern should be the League.

197
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,210
You can place Maseo in the same cage you put me in,

198
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,480
but my father has an army at his command.

199
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,330
- One step at a time. - Oliver...

200
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,400
We're going to have to spread out

201
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,630
if we're going to cover that entire building.

202
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,770
- Dig, I want you on over watch. - Copy that.

203
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,180
What about her?

204
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,930
Don't confuse my inclination to provide you information

205
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,180
with a willingness to take up arms against the League.

206
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,780
We appreciate what you've done.

207
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,100
We'll take it from here.

208
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,230
Let's do this.

209
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,690
We scoped out every floor, nothing.

210
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,370
Same with the parking garage.

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,910
Diggle!

212
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,310
North side is clear.

213
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,110
You think Nyssa played us?

214
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,510
Hang on, I got movement.

215
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,950
Upper level, southwest corner.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,270
Clearly I chose well

218
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,170
selecting you as my heir.

219
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,420
Killing me will only win you the mantle you reject.

220
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,810
It'll stop you.

221
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,490
I have legions who live

222
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,610
only to see my will done.

223
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,750
No, boy.

224
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,930
You have but two choices--

225
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,570
You either ascend to the calling of Ra's Al Ghul

226
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,810
or you will spend the rest of your days in a cage.

227
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,870
You're not going to take me prisoner.

228
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,100
No, I'm not.

229
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,640
This is the Starling City Police.

230
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,410
Put your weapons down and your hands up.

231
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,310
You are all under arrest.

232
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,970
On the ground, get on the ground.

233
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,600
Hold your fire, hold your fire!

234
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,690
Lock down this entire area, three block radius.

235
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,650
- Diggle! - I got eyes on.

236
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,810
The blue is everywhere.

237
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,510
The warehouse is on the west side of the block.

238
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,360
You get there, you're in the clear.

239
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,770
Go, move. Four more headed your way.

240
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,640
You got to move, move, move, move, move!

241
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,670
Go for the door. I'll draw their fire.

242
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,820
We're not separating!

243
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,980
They don't want you, they want me. Now go.

244
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,000
Cooper, Jones, box them in on 43rd.

245
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,050
I got two masks in a warehouse, west side of 43rd.

246
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,270
He's headed toward the east exit!

247
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,120
This way, take him!

248
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,700
Laurel!

249
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,290
What are you going to do?

250
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,400
Are you going to shoot your own daughter?

251
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
No. But I'm definitely thinking about arresting you.

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,070
Maybe a night in jail will bring you to your senses.

253
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,790
Daddy, please. Please don't do this.

254
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,150
Leave her alone.

255
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,970
Nyssa! Don't hurt him.

256
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,060
Laurel... what are you doing?

257
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,220
We must go.

258
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,110
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,170
Sweetie...

260
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,720
Did Arsenal and Canary get away?

261
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,120
Diggle!

262
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,430
Diggle!

263
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,590
Get back.

264
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,200
Get in!

265
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,240
If we get to the tunnel on 8th, we're good.

266
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,150
- Clear those squad cars. - On it.

267
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,330
Oh! Oh, thank God, I've been so worried.

268
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,370
It's ok. I'm ok.

269
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,620
Where's Roy?

270
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,540
He's still out there.

271
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,300
It's like the whole city has lost their minds!

272
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,240
It's not the whole city.

273
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,580
It's just one man.

274
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,190
- Yep? - Hello, captain.

275
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,240
I got three men in the hospital because of you.

276
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,930
I understand that you feel betrayed,

277
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,050
but you can't be so angry as to think

278
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,450
that I'm just running around taking aim at innocent people.

279
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,790
I don't think anything, I know.

280
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,320
I know this madness has to end.

281
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,130
Now, you don't want any more people getting hurt,

282
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,240
you turn yourself in.

283
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,580
Yeah, that's what I thought.

284
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,470
He's in a lot of pain.

286
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,320
I thought that if we stopped Maseo,

287
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,090
we'd stop the killings, but Nyssa was right.

288
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,020
This extends way beyond him.

289
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,440
Oh, Roy!

290
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm ok. I got clear somewhere on Hudson.

291
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,870
I had to shoot a few officers,

292
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,070
but they're just flesh wounds.

293
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,970
I've underestimated Ra's,

294
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,130
and now we're all paying the price.

295
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,840
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,030
What are you talking about?

297
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,960
Ra's is after us because of Malcolm.

298
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,820
What don't I know?

299
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,790
You haven't told me your names. I'm Mei.

300
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,970
I'm Akio, and this is--

301
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,880
Tommy.

302
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,280
So, Tommy,

303
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,190
who are you and your little friend running from?

304
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,010
It's...complicated.

305
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,460
But, Mei, the truth is that

306
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,180
I don't know why this person has sent men after us,

307
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,510
but she did.

308
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,480
Is that your father?

309
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,870
His name is Yao Fei.

310
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,200
And how do you know my sister?

311
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,430
Oh, medical school.

312
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,230
She never mentioned any American friends.

313
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,980
You are American, aren't you?

314
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,150
I dropped out of the medical school,

315
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,370
not of America.

316
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,070
So when was the last time you saw my sister?

317
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,590
It's been a while.

318
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,730
For me, too.

319
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,280
Shado and my father disappeared three years ago now.

320
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,000
Police think they were kidnapped, but no ransom came.

321
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,030
I'm so sorry.

322
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,170
The police told me they must be dead.

323
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,980
If they were, at least I'd have some closure.

324
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,220
But each time the phone rings, someone knocks at the door,

325
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,930
or when I meet someone who knew them...

326
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,040
I can't imagine.

327
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,830
You must be tired.

328
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,300
Not tired, dirty. I need a shower.

329
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,590
My bedroom's through that door. There are fresh towels.

330
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,510
- You're sure? - Yeah.

331
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,530
I'll entertain your friend.

332
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,330
Thank you.

334
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,710
Listen, I'm a cop, not a psychologist,

335
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,270
but in my experiences, killers don't discriminate

336
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,060
between guilty and innocent.

337
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,150
They kill because they view themselves as being above the law,

338
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,920
and the Arrow is no different.

339
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,410
He is a criminal. And I promise you,

340
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,490
we will find him and hold him accountable.

341
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,730
You OK?

342
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,040
Thanks for getting this.

343
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,560
I ran into Dr. Lockhart in the cafeteria.

344
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,860
I thought maybe, I don't know...

345
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,950
I could talk him into giving Ray those nano-thingies.

346
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,550
- Nano-tech. - He wouldn't even look at me.

347
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,400
Have you seen this dress? Hello!

348
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,310
Mom.

349
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,320
The man's an idiot.

350
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,210
I guess...

351
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,810
You're just going to have to be the one

352
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,530
to inject those teeny tiny robot things into Ray yourself.

353
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,600
Great plan, except I'm not a doctor.

354
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,030
Even Ray said that they can kill him.

355
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,230
I'm not going to be the one to risk his life, I'm not.

356
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,700
His life is already at risk.

357
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,740
What you're saying is that you don't want to be the one

358
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,920
to take the chance.

359
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,010
If your father were here...

360
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,520
He would be arrested.

361
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,150
Probably.

362
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,050
But right before that, he would tell you that sometimes,

363
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,420
we got to take a chance,

364
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,750
particularly for the people we care about.

365
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,890
I don't give a damn about budgets. This is a manhunt!

366
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,930
Now approve the extra personnel and the overtime,

367
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:41,910
and you do it now!

368
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,970
I apologize for the coarse treatment.

369
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,240
I didn't think I'd get you to speak to me of your own accord.

370
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,000
You're him.

371
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,290
Ra's Al Ghul. It's an honor to meet you.

372
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,690
Sara spoke with such love about her father.

373
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,060
Don't say my daughter's name.

374
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,730
If she'd never met you, she'd still be alive now.

375
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,020
If Sara had not met my daughter,

376
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,970
she would have starved to death

377
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,210
on the shores of Lian Yu.

378
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,730
She was never on Lian Yu.

379
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,190
You suffer false perception.

380
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,290
One of many, I'm afraid.

381
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,240
Listen, what do you want?

382
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,430
To help the city as your daughter did.

383
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,770
You hunt for the man they call the Arrow.

384
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,800
Yeah.

385
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,690
What, you going to help me find him?

386
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,140
You'll be able to find him easily...

387
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,320
once I tell you his name.

388
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,810
And why would I believe just any name that you'd throw at me?

389
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,280
Well, because with this revelation,

390
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,810
everything will become clear.

391
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,640
And you will realize

392
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,920
the man you've been looking for

393
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,320
has been right in front of you the entire time.

394
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,460
The same man who lied,

395
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,310
telling you he wasn't with Sara on Lian Yu.

396
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,850
Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

398
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,270
We need to talk.

399
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,390
Aren't you getting tired of these little chats?

400
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,340
Because I know I am.

401
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,130
Then let's cut through all the crap.

402
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,170
You don't think the Arrow's behind these murders.

403
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,020
You're just pissed off

404
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,090
because he kept Sara's death a secret from you.

405
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,900
That is not why.

406
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,310
That is not why!

407
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,700
I mean, maybe at first.

408
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,600
Yeah. But then I realized,

409
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,990
he is the reason Sara got killed.

410
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,320
Dad, that is ridiculous.

411
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,540
No. You, Harper, Sara,

412
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,220
the freak in Central City, the Huntress;

413
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,780
I got a new guy flying around the city.

414
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,530
All these masks? They started with him.

415
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,610
And Sara died only because she was part of it all, too.

416
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,460
You have no idea why Sara was killed.

417
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,900
She ended up in the League of Assassins

418
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,080
'cause she was marooned on Lian Yu.

419
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,150
'Cause she got in that boat with Queen.

420
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,220
So what?

421
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,490
Now Oliver's to blame?

422
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,540
Oliver, the Arrow, either way, same guy.

423
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,200
On some level, I think I always knew.

424
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,180
When I thought he was doing good, it didn't matter to me.

425
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,250
You know, when that boat went down

426
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,650
and we-- we thought Sara was dead,

427
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,130
I blamed Queen.

428
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,890
And it's funny how things come full circle, right?

429
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,570
Well, I got things to do.

430
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,600
Calling him?

431
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,120
It's too late; I've got officers headed to his home,

432
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,580
his sister's club, everywhere.

433
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,380
Oh, for what it's worth,

434
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,440
I'm thinking of starting a reality TV show,

435
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,210
so maybe I already have brain damage.

436
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,500
Don't joke, Mr. Palmer.

437
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,110
The next few hours are critical.

438
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,390
I'm going to want to keep you under close observation.

439
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,620
Mom?

440
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,190
No, no, no, it's nothing.

441
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,690
I think my back is spasming!

442
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,060
Gosh, you're so strong.

443
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,840
Oh, my god, I think I--

444
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,350
I think I'm going to faint.

445
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,590
Maybe we should get you on a gurney.

446
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,090
Yeah! Yeah, let's get me on a gurney.

447
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,020
Oh! I'm sorry.

448
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,410
Is your mom going to be ok?

449
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,940
I think she'll make a miraculous recovery

450
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,230
in about five minutes.

451
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,400
Just like you.

452
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,850
Is that my nano-tech?

453
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,030
Assuming the organizational system in your lab is accurate.

454
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,170
I-- are you sure you want to do this?

455
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,300
Aren't you?

456
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,300
Yeah. I mean, my alternatives

457
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,010
are brain damage or death.

458
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,510
But if the hospital finds out, you could go to jail.

459
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,660
I'll take my chances.

460
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,960
OK.

461
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,870
All right.

462
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,660
How do we feel?

463
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,680
Normal? But I wasn't expecting any side...

464
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,930
Ray? Ray!

465
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,390
Ray, Ray, hey!

466
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,320
OK, well...

467
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,700
Maybe there are some side effects.

468
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,210
I can't believe this is happening.

470
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,700
The line forms behind me.

471
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,030
The city-wide manhunt for the Arrow continues this evening

472
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,370
as Captain Lance has made capturing this dangerous vigilante

474
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,630
the SCPD's top priority.

475
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,090
I'm sure those cops that were chasing you are fine.

476
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,370
I shot them with arrows, Thea.

477
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,330
When it was happening, there was a part of me that...

478
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,000
that felt relieved.

479
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,370
Relieved?

480
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,760
That I'd finally be going to jail.

481
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,070
And I'd get what I deserved.

482
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,760
Roy, listen to me.

483
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,810
The only thing that you deserve is to be happy.

484
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:57,380
Now you've got to find a way to forgive yourself.

485
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,920
What happened with that cop last year, it's not your fault.

486
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,090
Sorry that you had to go through this, Roy.

487
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,660
I gave you that mask...

488
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,450
so you could help the police,

489
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,330
not run from them.

490
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,410
Then what's going to happen?

491
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,310
- Oh, no. - Run!

492
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,620
This is the SCPD! Freeze! Put your hands in the air.

493
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,210
Thank you for the shower.

494
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,850
You OK?

495
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,130
I saw the tattoo on your back.

496
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,270
Why have you been lying to me?

497
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,010
- Mei... - I need to know

498
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,540
what happened to my family.

499
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,760
- I don't know. - Another lie.

500
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,310
You knew my sister. You and her were more than just friends.

501
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,850
Just believe me when I tell you

502
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,310
that the less you know about me, the safer you're going to be.

503
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,410
Fine, maybe you'll be more honest with the police!

504
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,720
I understand you're upset. Please don't call the police.

505
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,930
I already did. They'll be here any minute.

506
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,330
Akio, we have to go.

507
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,270
What's wrong?

508
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,000
Get down!

509
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,630
Why are the police shooting?!

510
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,840
Because they're not the police!

511
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,050
I am so proud of you.

512
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,420
I am so proud-- your father would be proud of you.

513
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,540
You know, he's not exactly a role model, but...

514
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,340
Miss Smoak, just the person I wanted to see.

515
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,810
Do you know what these are?

516
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,360
They're Mr. Palmer's latest MRI.

517
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,060
The clot in his brain is gone.

518
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,190
Really?

519
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,470
Not moved, not smaller. Gone.

520
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,840
He's going to make a full recovery.

521
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,260
You wouldn't happen to know anything

522
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,710
about this unprecedented medical development, would you?

523
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,460
Are you accusing my daughter of something?

524
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,230
'Cause I work a table at Caesar's that's frequented

525
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,250
by no less than 3 lawyers.

526
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,350
Thank you. Thank you, please. Thank you all for coming.

527
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,540
We've had a breakthrough

528
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,710
in our investigation of the vigilante known as the Arrow.

529
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,290
The district attorney's office has just issued an arrest warrant

530
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,270
for the person responsible for these acts of violence--

531
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,220
I had nowhere else to go.

532
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,760
It's OK.

533
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,580
Lyla took Sara to her mother's.

534
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,810
Lance knows.

535
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,230
The whole city knows, Oliver.

536
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,580
Mr. Queen should be considered armed

538
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,470
and highly dangerous. But make no mistake--

539
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,140
he will be found and brought to justice.

540
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,530
A stunning development,

541
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,580
as Oliver Queen has been outed as the Arrow.

542
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,660
The accusation comes as a particular surprise,

543
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,990
considering that Queen was

544
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,830
exonerated of being the Arrow only 2 years ago.

545
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,680
News lady's right.

546
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,710
You put this genie back in the bottle before, Oliver.

547
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,430
Last time I had it all worked out.

548
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,310
Getting arrested was my plan.

549
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,070
This time it's Ra's Al Ghul's.

550
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,080
- How's Ray? - So much better than you right now.

551
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,270
Please tell me you have a brilliant plan.

552
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,170
I don't even have a regular plan.

553
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,100
What about Dig going out as the Arrow?

554
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,130
You said that worked last time.

555
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,950
Yeah, but this time Lance won't rest until Oliver's in custody.

556
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,910
You have to leave. You have to get out of town.

557
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,370
My father's posted men at every bus station,

558
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,670
train station, and airport.

559
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,920
Also... he's frozen Thea's assets.

560
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,460
He's not giving you anything you can use to run.

561
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,850
I can't believe this is happening.

562
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,550
Do you think Ra's planned this the entire time?

563
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,710
He's using this city as a weapon.

564
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,840
It's my city.

565
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,860
Where you going, Oliver?

566
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,790
Only place I can go.

567
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,740
- Akio, you ok?! - I'm OK.

568
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,060
- OK. - What's happening?!

569
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,960
- Is the front door the only way in and out? - Yes.

570
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,250
I want you to get low, I want you to take Akio to the bedroom.

571
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,890
Mei, they're coming to kill you, too.

572
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,420
Go, go, come on!

573
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,490
Akio?!

574
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,580
Akio?

575
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,780
We followed them. They work for Amanda Waller.

576
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,760
Who is she?

577
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,030
How are you feeling?

578
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,430
For a guy who just avoided death

579
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,420
and/or brain damage, pretty good.

580
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,380
Good.

581
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,100
Are you OK?

582
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,620
It's...

583
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,760
it's a long story.

584
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,460
I'm just glad that you're all right.

585
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,420
Thanks to you.

586
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,710
Oh, I think your nano-tech deserves some of the credit.

587
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,800
All I did was stick something in you.

588
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,460
Do you think there will ever come a time

589
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,910
when everything I say isn't some weird double entendre?

590
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,910
I hope not. It's one of your more charming traits.

591
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,630
That, and the fact that you

592
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,560
had the courage to throw caution to the wind and save my life

593
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,170
are just two of the many reasons that I love you.

594
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,050
That's a really nice thing to hear.

595
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,730
Especially after, you know, everything

596
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,100
that's been going on with you

597
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,880
with the blood clot, nano-tech, and the...

598
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,390
nearly dying.

599
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,130
Speaking of, you must be starving after all that drama.

600
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,490
I'm going to go find a hospital nurse

601
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,900
and get you some of that hospital jell-o.

602
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,240
Oh, my God, what just happened?

603
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,000
Nothing.

604
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,290
Felicity.

605
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,870
You look the way you did when you were seven years old

606
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,020
and stole your father's

607
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,740
electronics collection to make a super computer.

608
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,790
Oh, my God.

609
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,260
Did you and Ray just do it in this hospital?

610
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,210
- Did you just have hospital sex?! - No! Oh!

611
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,380
I've always wanted to have hospital sex!

612
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,130
Way TMIi! Gross!

613
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,090
What?

614
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:54,020
He told me he loved me.

615
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,600
And you didn't say it back?

616
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,730
What is wrong with me?

617
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,250
He's brilliant.

618
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:10,360
He knows the plot to every "Doctor Who" episode.

619
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:11,270
All 34 seasons.

620
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,890
He looks like a Disney Prince.

621
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,290
I mean, he's...

622
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,930
practically the perfect man.

623
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,130
You don't love Ray...

624
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:24,490
because you're in love with Oliver.

625
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,040
You don't even know Oliver.

626
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,810
You met him for like ten seconds.

627
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,050
I knew it in five.

628
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,230
Honey, you lit up like Christmas

629
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,940
when he walked in the room.

630
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,450
But he's... terminally unavailable.

631
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,550
And that was before.

632
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:43,870
You haven't been watching the news.

633
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,630
No, no, no, I don't watch the news, it depresses me.

634
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,360
But here's what doesn't-- my daughter

635
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,100
has two men who are both amazing,

636
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,480
which just means...

637
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,510
she has to make a choice.

638
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,940
I want pictures of Queen distributed to every officer, ok?

639
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,600
No, a current one, one with the scruff he's always wearing.

640
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,760
Captain Lance...

641
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,040
I'm here to turn myself in.

642
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,960
Cuff him.

643
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,800
OK, I was able to get you ten minutes with Oliver,

644
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:37,970
but let's make it five, all right?

645
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,270
It would not look good if any of these reporters

646
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,670
caught wind of you meeting with him.

647
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,580
Him, and the three of you?

648
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,140
Makes sense.

649
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,470
You shouldn't be here.

650
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,110
Oliver, neither should you.

651
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,780
What were you thinking? Were you thinking?!

652
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,880
I was thinking clearly.

653
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,900
I asked Laurel to make a deal-- I turn myself in

654
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,310
and all of you receive full immunity.

655
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,010
No, Oliver. You are out of your mind

656
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,440
if you think we're just going to stand here

657
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,080
and let you take the fall for all of us.

658
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,420
I started all of this.

659
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,410
It's my fault to take,

660
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,710
and this is the best way to save lives,

661
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,300
including yours.

662
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,020
So stop worrying. I've been through

663
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,150
- far worse than prison. - This is insane.

664
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,650
How could we live with ourselves if we let you do this?

665
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,100
Roy, I'm just going to need you to!

666
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,800
The only move that Ra's has left me

667
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,800
is telling the truth.

668
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,440
You have no idea

669
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,820
how powerful the truth can be.

670
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,490
Oliver, this is the wrong move!

671
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
John...

672
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,360
you followed me this far.

673
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,740
All of you have followed me this far,

674
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,900
but I need you

675
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,540
to follow me just a little further.

676
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,890
Until it's over.

677
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,620
The bodies are taken care of.

678
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:33,920
We should go.

679
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,990
Just give us a minute.

680
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,960
I'm sorry about this.

681
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,230
They tried to kill us.

682
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,520
They weren't the cops.

683
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,860
They must have intercepted the call.

684
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,570
They were after you and the boy?

685
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,230
You knew my sister; is there any chance--

686
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,480
This...

687
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,100
this had nothing to do with Shado.

688
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,860
You have no idea what it's like

689
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,930
to live like this.

690
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,200
Looking for any kind of answer.

691
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,770
You were right that I knew your sister.

692
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,340
I loved her.

693
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,610
I knew your father, too.

694
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,590
And your family...

695
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,110
they saved my life more than once.

696
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,840
I don't understand.

697
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,670
The people that are after me...

698
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,090
They'll kill anyone who knows too much about who I am.

699
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,190
But Shado and my father--

700
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,180
They...

701
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,990
they're gone.

702
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,750
I'm so sorry.

703
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:06,410
Thank you for telling me.

704
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,850
For three years now,

705
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,900
all I've wanted is to know the truth.

706
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,460
You have no idea how powerful the truth can be.

707
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,250
We shouldn't stay here.

708
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,030
Thank you.

709
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,700
This isn't fair.

710
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,790
This isn't right.

711
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,120
All Oliver has ever done was protect people.

712
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,100
Help people.

713
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,140
We can't stay here.

714
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,850
This place isn't secure anymore.

715
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,050
And then what?

716
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,110
We just bug out and allow this to happen?

717
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,860
Enjoy our new immunity?

718
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,830
Roy, I don't know! I have no idea.

719
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,900
If I did, you'd be listening to it right now.

720
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,360
If any one of us were in there and Oliver was here,

721
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,570
he would think of something.

722
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,670
And it wouldn't matter what the consequences were.

723
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,280
Lian Yu.

724
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:29,560
What about it?

725
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,880
This, Ra's character,

726
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,900
he told me that Sara made it to the island with you.

727
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,020
You didn't feel like sharing that with me? Huh?

728
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,760
I mean, I'm only her father.

729
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,610
Well, I was.

730
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,420
When did you decide that you knew what was best for my family?

731
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,590
I love your family.

732
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,280
You got the right to remain silent. Take it!

733
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,670
Just ask me what you want to know.

734
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,790
What do I want to know?

735
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,130
Well, was it worth it?

736
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:12,770
All that pain and misery you brought back from that island?

737
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:15,060
Merlyn, Slade Wilson?

738
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,590
Wouldn't it be better if you just died there?

739
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:21,280
The reason I came back was to try and save

740
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,840
the people of this city.

741
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,410
I hate to break it to you,

742
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,130
but saving people isn't your specialty.

743
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,540
Tommy.

744
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,120
Hilton.

745
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,050
Your mother.

746
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,130
My daughter.

747
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,970
And now you're set on killing Laurel, too.

748
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,660
I didn't want her to be involved in this.

749
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,100
I didn't want anyone to be involved in this.

750
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,450
But you involved me.

751
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,070
You spent a year making me look like a fool.

752
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,480
You spent a year making me your accomplice.

753
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:52,850
You have any idea what you've done, huh?

754
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,140
What you've done to all of us,

755
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,550
to the people you claim to care so much about?

756
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,000
You've made us criminals!

757
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,060
You've made us liars and victims.

758
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,770
You, Mr. Queen, are not a hero.

759
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,680
You're a villain.

760
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,060
But you know that, don't you?

761
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,850
What the hell are your people doing?

762
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,420
I told them to stand down.

763
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,080
Well, I guess your word carries as much weight with them

764
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,130
as it does with me.

765
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,090
Get down on the ground!

766
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,170
Get down on the ground!

767
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:30,890
You've got the wrong guy.

768
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,240
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

769
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,560
I am.
