00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,280
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,004
I want you to decide if you love me more
than you hate what I did.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,884
And if you do,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,889
then I want you to come home.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,651
And the only thing they'll definitely find
if they get a look at those files

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,886
is that you've
embezzled money.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,129
Listen to me, goddamn it!
We need to undo this deal.

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,364
- We have nothing to hide.
- No, no, this is a ploy.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,881
He's trying to get me on record
stating that we have everything

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,931
and if I find nothing, he's going
to file malicious prosecution charges.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,850
Actually, Sean, I'm filing
those charges right now.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,770
Harvey went to court this morning

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,441
and agreed to hand over every single
document on the Gillie takeover.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,050
Including Forstman.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,926
Shit.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,168
Then it's only a matter of time before
I'm marched out of here in handcuffs.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,930
If he did make
a dirty deal with Forstman,

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,929
it wouldn't have been in those
documents, it would have been...

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,930
The documents we just told the court
we're happy to turn over.

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,882
What are you going to do?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,401
I'm gonna find out
what the hell Louis did.

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,324
I made a huge mistake.

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,045
HARVEY: What's going on?

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,051
Louis, I want you to tell Harvey
exactly what you just told me, or I will.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,481
He doesn't have to.
He made a dirty deal with Forstman.

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,206
Harvey, I can explain.

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,606
Explain what? That you
put the firm in jeopardy

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,650
- all because you had to be the hero?
- I didn't do it to be the hero.

29
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,444
I didn't even know
I was gonna do it at all.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,647
HARVEY: What?

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,127
The deal was closed, and
you were so happy we won.

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,921
Then I went back that night,
Forstman said if I didn't

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,169
funnel the money overseas,
the deal was off, so I did it.

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,847
There's more.

35
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,325
JESSICA: How do you
know there's more?

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,681
Because with Forstman
there's always more.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,042
He made me take
a million dollars out of the deal

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,481
so I couldn't turn on him later.

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,369
- Jesus Christ.
- I had no choice!

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,130
Bullshit, you had no choice!

41
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,891
You could've said no at any
goddamn point along the way,

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,650
but you didn't, because all you cared
about was yourself.

43
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,285
Okay, if I care
about myself so much,

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,607
how come I'm in here telling
you that I'm gonna confess?

45
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,290
You want to confess?
Be my guest!

46
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,244
Harvey, that's enough.

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,446
Louis, the problem with that
is that we're innocent.

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,641
Cahill's plan is to throw mud
against the wall and see what sticks.

49
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,561
You tell him about what you did,
and all of a sudden, everything sticks.

50
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,727
Okay-

51
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,650
- But I have to do something to help.
- You will, when the time comes.

52
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,725
Right now, I need to talk to Harvey.

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,882
I can't believe you're taking this
as well as you are.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,684
I'm not taking this well at all.

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,848
Then what the hell
are you being so nice to him for?

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,565
Did you hear?

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,160
He was going to confess.
I had to calm him down.

58
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,808
- So you're not gonna stand by him?
- Stand by him?

59
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,641
The second this thing is over,
I'm gonna fire his goddamn ass.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,162
- How was your shower?
- It was great.

61
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,045
Rachel, you don't have
to clean up for me. I live here.

62
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,210
I know, I just...
I want everything to be perfect.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,287
It is.

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,803
Is this my parents' photo album?

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,764
Oh, yeah, it was in
the back of the closet.

66
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,531
Yeah, I know where it was.
Why is it out here?

67
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,688
Because I was looking
for pictures of you.

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,722
What do you want to
do for dinner tonight?

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,366
I was thinking maybe we could hit
that little Mexican spot.

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,927
No. You just got back here.
I don't want to go anywhere.

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,686
I don't either,
but we don't have anything to eat.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,723
- Don't we?
- Well, I know for a fact

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,080
we don't have any
bean and cheese burritos.

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,329
Mmm, then why are there
six of them in the fridge right now?

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,486
You hate them.

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,207
I do, but you love them,
and I wanted you

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,685
to have them here
when you came home.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,165
And what if I didn't
come home tonight?

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,841
Then I would have bought fresh ones
again tomorrow.

80
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,205
Thanks, Rachel.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,724
It's good to have you home.

82
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,771
It's good to be home.

83
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,686
What happened?

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,370
I thought you had a date.

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,323
I canceled it,
and I asked you a question.

86
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,487
I don't want to talk about it,

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,647
because I know what
you're going to say.

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,882
Harvey, I don't even know
what exactly Louis did.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,968
He broke the law
to close Forstman.

90
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,884
He broke it,
or Forstman made him break it?

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,047
- What's the goddamn difference?
- Harvey...

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,891
You don't have to say it, Donna,
I've heard it 1,000 times.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,684
Louis only did this
to get my approval.

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,404
And you know what?
I don't give a shit

95
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,885
that I agreed to be his best man.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,083
He put you, me, and every one of us
in jeopardy to get what he wanted.

97
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,771
Well, I was gonna say that,
but instead I'll say this.

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,405
You put us all in jeopardy, too.

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,891
When the hell did I do that?

100
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,644
The day you hired Mike.

101
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,201
And by the way, I'm guessing
he wouldn't even be back here

102
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,845
if Louis hadn't done what he did.

103
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,445
Then tell that to Jessica, 'cause
when it's over, she's gonna fire him.

104
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,129
They keep this place
open late for you?

105
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,924
Ownership has its privileges.

106
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,365
What do you want, Harvey?

107
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,325
I want you to undo the dirty deal
you made with Louis Litt.

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,881
Dirty deal.
Doesn't sound like me at all.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,809
How does prison sound?

110
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,809
Because the SEC
is gonna get a record

111
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,604
of the shit you
pulled tomorrow morning.

112
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,209
There is no record,
'cause I didn't do anything.

113
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,887
Louis Litt came to me,
and he's the one who embezzled money.

114
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,651
And your grudge isn't with Louis.
It's with me, so let him go.

115
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,681
- Live to fight me another day.
- If I let him off, I let you off.

116
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,811
And I don't think I want to do that.

117
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,526
Then you're forcing me
to turn you in for what you did

118
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,841
twelve years ago.

119
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,729
No way. You're not gonna do that,
because you did it too, pal.

120
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,525
But if you did it to Louis,

121
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,803
and you did it to me,
you did it to 100 others.

122
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,968
And if you don't do what I'm asking,

123
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,801
I'll just have to find the one in 100
that's in a position to turn on you.

124
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,241
I'll take my chances, Harvey.

125
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,964
Now, get out of my face.
Let me finish my cigar in peace.

126
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,763
(SINGING) See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

127
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,049
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

128
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,607
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

129
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,809
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

130
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,003
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

131
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,647
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,321
All right!

133
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,530
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,004
The greenback boogie

135
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,041
- You know?
- Of course I do.

136
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,285
- I never meant to...
- Louis...

137
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,562
I understand why
you did what you did.

138
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,522
You do?

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,610
Yes. You went down a path
with the best intentions,

140
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,650
and then it just got worse and worse,
until it was too late.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,162
- Feel like shit.
- And you should.

142
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,361
What?

143
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,163
- But you just said...
- I understand? I do.

144
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,649
But I don't think you
understand that every

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,728
other time you screwed up,
it was a mistake,

146
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,208
- and this time, it was a choice!
- That's what Harvey said.

147
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,766
Of course that's what Harvey said.
And just because I get what happened,

148
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,245
it doesn't mean that
you deserve to be let off the hook.

149
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,762
So if you've come in here to ask me
to go to him for the millionth time, I'm...

150
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,322
- No, I'm not here for that.
- Then... Then what are you here for?

151
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,049
I'm here to ask you
if I'm gonna get fired.

152
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,609
- What?
- I saw how he looked at me, Donna.

153
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,324
I know he trusts you.

154
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,886
But I need to know
if Harvey's planning on firing me.

155
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,731
No, Louis.

156
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,606
To my knowledge,
Harvey isn't planning to fire you.

157
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,370
Thank you, Donna.

158
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,203
I knew I could count on you.

159
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,649
Can't remember
the last time I saw you in here.

160
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,923
I can't remember the last time
this firm faced prosecution.

161
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,042
I can, Ava Hessington.

162
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,969
And after that, we said
it would never come to this again.

163
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,127
How the hell did it?

164
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,686
We stepped into
the ring with Charles Forstman.

165
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,410
I'm guessing he
didn't budge last night.

166
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,601
He didn't.

167
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,808
He sheltered himself,
and he'd rather laugh in my face

168
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,605
than be 100% protected
against the SEC.

169
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,011
- You have a plan B?
- He doesn't, but I do.

170
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,050
What the hell is it?

171
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,003
What would you do if you were Cahill?

172
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,521
Go through every one of these boxes,
and start deposing us.

173
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,645
Okay, so what if while he's doing that,
we start deposing him?

174
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,730
Did you come here to personally
deliver my files?

175
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,729
I came here to personally deliver this.

176
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,285
Well, if it's an invitation
to your birthday party,

177
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,566
I think I'm busy that day.

178
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,808
That's too bad.
I promised the children a clown.

179
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,291
You've got to be kidding me.

180
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,762
You got Judge Hopkins
to let you start depositions

181
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,769
on your malicious
prosecution bullshit?

182
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,006
He didn't think it was bullshit,

183
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,487
which is why he's letting me start
with your boyfriend, Eric Woodall.

184
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,689
You trying to take my eye off the ball,
Harvey?

185
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,926
This is the ball, Sean.

186
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,884
It's a wrecking ball,
and it's headed your way.

187
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,481
Louis, where the hell have you been?
Those documents are on their way over.

188
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,840
Katrina, relax.

189
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,771
Flail

190
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,282
The last time I saw you,
you were worried about going to prison.

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,606
What did you decide to do?

192
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,643
I went to Harvey and Jessica,
and I told them everything.

193
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,091
What?

194
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,091
Jessica said that I made a mistake,
and they're working on a way out.

195
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,488
Louis, have you seen
any mafia movie ever made?

196
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,045
I'm not really a fan of the genre.

197
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,844
I find it to be a little
offensive to Italians...

198
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,121
Shut up, and listen.

199
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,531
She's telling you to your face
she'll let you live,

200
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,610
but behind your back,
she's making plans to whack you.

201
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,722
Holy shit, I'm living on borrowed time.

202
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,968
Unless you fix this, because if you don't,

203
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,084
even if Jessica manages
to keep you out of prison,

204
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,884
she'll be coming to fire you.

205
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,562
Jessica, I was just thinking

206
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,889
about our dinner plans tonight,
and I think that...

207
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,566
- What's wrong?
- We're going after Eric Woodall.

208
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,009
Harvey moved up the timeline.

209
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,445
And since this is Harvey's case now,
why are you talking to me?

210
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,928
'Cause I need you
to find out every dirty thing

211
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,089
Eric Woodall has ever done,
condoned, or been part of.

212
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,848
Jessica, I really
don't feel comfortable

213
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,122
participating in blackmail
without knowing why.

214
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,801
It's not blackmail,
it's evidence, and I'll tell you why.

215
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,127
Because malicious
prosecution is easier to prove

216
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,520
when there's a track record.

217
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,483
Yeah, there's only
one problem with that.

218
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,807
You see, just yesterday,
we agreed to hand over our files

219
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,365
because we had nothing to hide.

220
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,528
And now, you want me
to go after the SEC,

221
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,801
- which means we do.
- Jeff...

222
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,685
Jessica, hide it from
them all you want, okay?

223
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,245
But we talked about this,
and you said

224
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,931
that I shouldn't be treated
like any other partner.

225
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,963
So don't come in here
hiding it from me.

226
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,204
You want a straight answer,
I'll give you a straight answer.

227
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,771
Harvey did not
collude with Mike Ross,

228
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,803
but Sean Cahill doesn't
give a shit about that.

229
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,651
So I need you to do
whatever you have to

230
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,001
and get me
something on these guys.

231
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,762
Hey, how did Cahill handle our surprise?

232
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,562
Actually, I got to hand it to him.
He handled it pretty damn well.

233
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,681
What?

234
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,131
You guys had your whole
Wonder Twins riff,

235
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,605
and now you're giving him respect?

236
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,087
What's next,
a time share in the Florida Keys?

237
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,806
- Easy, tiger.
- Just saying, I got two words for you,

238
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,809
"Bro-mance".

239
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,888
Before you order us
a gift off our registry,

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,809
let me tell you
what he's been up to.

241
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,491
He had Judge Hopkins sign off
on his depositions.

242
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,644
Meaning he's coming at us
the same time we go after him.

243
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,524
- We can handle it.
- Can Rachel?

244
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,402
What?

245
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,770
Take a look.
She's first on the list.

246
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,690
And you want me
to tell her it's coming?

247
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,406
I want you to do more than that.
I want you to prep her.

248
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,962
Harvey, that's not a good idea.

249
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,650
Yes, it is. You're the
best person for the job.

250
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,445
- I am the worst person for the job.
- And you're only saying it,

251
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,210
because it makes you
feel uncomfortable.

252
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,845
How do you think Cahill's
gonna make Rachel feel

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,445
when he gets her under oath?

254
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,601
Usually, people don't start
by washing their hands.

255
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,246
Usually, people aren't here to talk
about Louis.

256
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,368
Donna.

257
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,804
Jessica, he made a mistake.

258
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,764
"Mistake" implies that
he did something by accident.

259
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,450
Louis made a choice.

260
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,969
And you're making the choice
to fire him when this is over.

261
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,203
And how the hell is that
any of your business?

262
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,642
I just thought if Louis could
help get you out of it...

263
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,841
Help get me out of it?

264
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,730
He's the one that got me into it.

265
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,763
And if this were Harvey,
you'd let him try to make up for it.

266
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,282
And if this were Harvey,
I'd have the confidence that he would.

267
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,364
Jessica, Louis did all of this

268
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,131
because he is dying
for your approval.

269
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,486
You never have confidence in him,

270
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,204
and you never treat him
the way you treat Harvey.

271
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,481
So this is my fault?

272
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,326
I'm saying Harvey's made mistakes,
and you've forgiven him.

273
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,682
I've made mistakes,
and you've forgiven me.

274
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,482
You're right, Donna,
you did make a mistake once,

275
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,446
and I did forgive you,
but first I fired you.

276
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,681
And if you don't back off me right now,
I will do it again.

277
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,730
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a deposition to get to.

278
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,889
HARVEY: Please state
your full name for the record.

279
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,805
- Eric Ignatius Woodall.
- Ignatius?

280
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,850
- Like the saint.
- I doubt that.

281
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,450
And how long have
you worked for the SEC?

282
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,767
- Two months.
- And where were you before that?

283
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,769
I worked at the U.S. Attorneys' office.

284
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,803
Until I got you fired
for malicious prosecution.

285
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,160
You didn't get me fired.

286
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,250
You slandered me
to a person in power,

287
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,169
which caused me
to leave a job I loved.

288
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,520
To avoid getting fired.

289
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,802
You have no proof of that,
and he has no knowledge of that.

290
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,083
Does he have any knowledge
of his feelings towards me?

291
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,920
(CHUCKLES) I don't have
any feelings for you, Mr. Specter.

292
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,691
And for your information,
I landed on my feet.

293
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,168
Yes, we know, at the SEC.
But we don't want to talk about that.

294
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,964
We want to talk about Jim Pembry.

295
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,364
HARVEY: You don't seem
too comfortable anymore, Eric.

296
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,001
Who's Jim Pembry?

297
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,048
I worked with Jim
at the U.S. Attorneys' office.

298
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,528
- On the Arthur Cohen prosecution?
- I believe he did some work for me.

299
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,964
You believe? You sent him over 1,200
emails on that case over four years.

300
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,447
If you say so.

301
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,965
HARVEY: Actually,
your computer records say so.

302
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,767
And I could read them all,
but I'd rather start with my favorite.

303
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,087
"I don't care what
we get Arthur Cohen on.

304
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,090
"Tax evasion, insider trading,
jaywalking if we have to,

305
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,884
"but we're putting that
piece of shit behind bars."

306
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,922
Where the hell did you get that?

307
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,281
It's not important where we got it,
but that we got it.

308
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,607
Emails get heated.
It was the middle of a case.

309
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,961
The problem is, Eric,
this was dated two years

310
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,451
before you even brought your big case.

311
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,210
- SEAN: Do you have a question?
- HARVEY: I sure do.

312
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,369
You decide someone's guilty,
then you find the crime to fit them.

313
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,686
- Isn't that true?
- No.

314
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,768
HARVEY: You want me
to get you for pel'jury, too?

315
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,690
You tried to get
Arthur on one thing.

316
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,842
Instead, you got him
on another, didn't you?

317
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,121
- Don't answer him.
- Yes.

318
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,322
And that's exactly what you want
to do with me, isn't it?

319
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,488
That's enough. Stop typing.
We're done here.

320
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,051
- To answer your question...
- Don't...

321
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,889
You're damn right it is.

322
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,841
HARVEY: That's okay.
You may not be on record,

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,490
but I got what I wanted.

324
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,487
- You're not my usual guy.
- I'm not a usual anything.

325
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,802
No, you're not.

326
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,641
We got him, thanks to you.

327
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,846
Thanks to Jim Pembry.

328
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,242
I'm not here to celebrate
with Jim Pembry.

329
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,848
Jessica, we may have landed
the first punch, but we're next up.

330
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,804
- And Cahill's gonna be brutal on us.
- No, he isn't.

331
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,207
- What do you mean?
- We're going to court tomorrow.

332
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,766
And with any luck, we're gonna
get this whole thing tossed

333
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,609
before he even has a chance
to depose us.

334
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,761
Well, then, maybe
we should go to dinner.

335
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,166
I have a better idea.

336
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,401
Let's order in.

337
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,768
Miss Zane, do you
live with Michael Ross,

338
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,451
the lawyer on the other
side of this takeover?

339
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,802
Yes.

340
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,008
And, uh, and at any point
during the takeover,

341
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,724
did you discuss
business with him?

342
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,927
No.

343
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,686
You expect me to believe that?

344
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,366
I don't care whether you believe it or not,
because it's the truth.

345
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,051
The truth.

346
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,444
Did you discuss Logan Sanders
with Mr. Ross?

347
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,849
- Yes.
- I'm confused.

348
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,246
You just said that you
didn't discuss business

349
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,243
with Mr. Ross, yet now you're saying

350
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,448
that you discussed the man
on the other side of the takeover.

351
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,449
How the hell can one be true
without the other?

352
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,643
- That wasn't about business.
- Then what was it about?

353
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,482
It was about the fact that I used
to be involved with Logan Sanders.

354
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,441
And did you assure Mr. Ross

355
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,643
that you wouldn't become involved
with Logan Sanders again?

356
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,410
- What does that have to do with...
- Answer my question.

357
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,807
Yes, I did.

358
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,121
And yet, over the course
of the takeover,

359
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,322
you did become involved
with him again, didn't you?

360
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,327
No, I didn't.

361
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,522
You had no physical contact
of a sexual nature at all...

362
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,802
- Mike, please, I don't...
- Just answer my question.

363
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,727
- We kissed once, and that was it.
- Did you sleep with him?

364
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,050
He is not going to ask me...

365
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,924
You just lied. You said
you weren't involved,

366
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,769
and then you said you kissed him.
So I'm gonna ask you again.

367
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,564
Did you sleep with Logan Sanders

368
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,126
after you assured the man
that you supposedly love

369
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,004
that you wouldn't
become involved again?

370
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,042
I'm not gonna answer that,

371
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,731
because it doesn't have anything
to do with collusion.

372
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,966
It goes to credibility.
It goes to

373
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,287
what you're capable of,
whether a jury should trust you.

374
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,607
- A jury or you?
- What difference does that make?

375
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,960
The difference is you're
the one that's doing it,

376
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,566
- because you don't trust me.
- Because Harvey needs me to.

377
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,761
- It is vicious, and it's cruel.
- I am doing my job.

378
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,082
- Mike, I thought you were over this.
- Well, I'm goddamn not!

379
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,960
(SIGHS)

380
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,286
I didn't sleep with Logan.

381
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,762
I kissed him,
and I hate myself for it.

382
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,765
Mike, I'm so sorry.

383
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,328
And I can apologize to you every day
for the rest of my life, but I... I...

384
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,529
I don't know what else to do,
other than to tell you that...

385
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,766
You mean more to me

386
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,367
than anything in the world,
and I need you to believe me.

387
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,045
I need you to believe me so that
we can move on and live our lives.

388
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,886
Think that's enough
questions for tonight.

389
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,970
Louis, what the hell
are you doing here?

390
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,771
I read the Eric Woodall deposition,
and I thought I could help.

391
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,927
Help what?

392
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,241
You're here to shut down Sean Cahill,

393
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,691
and he's not gonna
give up without a fight.

394
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,245
Louis, I don't have time for this.

395
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,885
So take your arguments
and get the hell out of here.

396
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,765
- Please, Jessica, I want to help.
- I don't need your help.

397
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,921
We're about to put this thing to bed.

398
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,850
- And I feel responsible.
- You are responsible.

399
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,928
You are the entire reason
we are in jeopardy,

400
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,487
and you want to sit your stupid face
in front of Cahill?

401
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,331
You may as well wear a sign that says,
"Depose me next."

402
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,649
And if he does that,
you will tumble like a house of cards,

403
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,842
because you are ruled
by your emotions,

404
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,931
and that is the reason why we are
in this situation in the first place.

405
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,611
- Can I at least sit in the gallery?
- I don't care where you sit,

406
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,846
but Cahill's gonna be here
in 30 seconds,

407
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,928
so it better be far away from me.

408
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,607
What the hell is he doing here?

409
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,690
The important thing is
is that he's not sitting here anymore.

410
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,486
Mr. Cahill, this email
makes a strong case

411
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,604
that Eric Woodall has a propensity
for malicious prosecution.

412
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,727
Yes, it does, Your Honor,

413
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,810
but I'm the one pursuing this case,
not Eric Woodall.

414
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,843
And I don't have
a propensity for anything.

415
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,962
I'm a simple man trying to do my job.

416
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,651
HARVEY: You expect us to believe
that the guy you came up with

417
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,764
at the Department of Justice
comes over to the SEC,

418
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,406
and you immediately
start coming after us,

419
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,567
and it's a coincidence?

420
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,523
Doesn't take much to connect
the dots here, Your Honor.

421
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,689
Well, as long as we're connecting dots,
I can connect a few, too.

422
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,767
Let's start with Jeff Malone.

423
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,325
A man who used to
work at the SEC,

424
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,761
now conveniently
works at Pearson Specter.

425
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,609
It's not against
the law to change jobs.

426
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,324
Yes, but why did he change jobs?

427
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,126
Because he was instructed to come
after us on behalf of the SEC.

428
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,607
So he says.
I think it's because he wanted to work

429
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,882
with his girlfriend, Jessica Pearson.

430
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,967
Excuse me?

431
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,889
Ms. Pearson hired Mr. Malone,

432
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,411
because if you're planning
to break some rules,

433
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,045
you need someone
to navigate them for you.

434
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,845
Who better to do that than
your boyfriend who works at the SEC?

435
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,961
That's ridiculous.

436
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,889
Do you have any
proof of this allegation?

437
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,286
Right here.

438
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,089
I can call you up to the stand,
or we can do this right now.

439
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,281
Were you seeing Jeff Malone during
the time that he worked for the SEC?

440
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,289
Please let the record
reflect Ms. Pearson said yes.

441
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,324
JUDGE: Well, a romantic relationship
isn't proof of a conspiracy,

442
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,851
but it's not irrelevant.

443
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,042
I'll allow you to move
forward with depositions.

444
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,126
I don't care what we have to do.
I'm not losing to that son of a bitch.

445
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,242
Despite what we just proved,
you're not losing to him,

446
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,407
you're losing to me.

447
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,206
And as far as depositions go,
now it's our turn.

448
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,721
Louis.

449
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,085
Is there something
I can help you with?

450
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,322
I was just thinking things were
so much simpler when I was in here.

451
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,444
- Yeah, Louis...
- I know about you and Jessica.

452
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,610
- What?
- It came out in court.

453
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,403
See, I thought you were
using me to get ahead,

454
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,007
when you really just wanted
to spend more time with Jessica.

455
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,644
What are you doin' in here, Louis?

456
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,205
I'm here to apologize.

457
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,327
You wanted to be my friend,
and I rejected you,

458
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,727
because you were
trying to protect her.

459
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,808
You must've felt so alone.

460
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,367
And believe me,
I know what it's like to feel alone.

461
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,042
- You're not alone.
- Oh, I am.

462
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,128
Jessica said that
I'm responsible for everything

463
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,288
that's happening, and she was right.

464
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,528
No one made me make
that dirty deal with Forstman,

465
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,610
and now she won't forgive me.
I'm alone.

466
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,926
And you want me
to talk to her for you.

467
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,202
You're the only one I can go to, Jeff.

468
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,366
And you're the closest person she has.

469
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,920
Sure, Louis.

470
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,689
I'll talk to Jessica for you.

471
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,569
. HEY-
. HEY-

472
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,761
You're off the hook with Cahill.

473
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,281
He's gonna start with me and Harvey
in the morning.

474
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,561
- Am I?
- Are you what?

475
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,886
Off the hook.

476
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,846
Rachel...

477
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,046
I didn't mean for what happened
to happen.

478
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,441
- But it did.
- I know.

479
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,286
- Mike...
- I still haven't gotten

480
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,368
a full night's sleep
since you told me.

481
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,649
I know that you're
not completely over it.

482
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,284
But things are gonna come up, and I...

483
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,967
Want me to not be vicious and cruel.

484
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,530
Do you think that's possible?

485
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,482
(SIGHS)

486
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,125
I hope so.

487
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,524
I hope so, too.

488
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,043
If it means anything,

489
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,210
I haven't gotten a good night's sleep
since any of this happened either.

490
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,207
Maybe we can both
give it a shot tonight.

491
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,928
SEAN: Let's start with one for you,
Mr. Ross.

492
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,321
Were you on good terms
with him when you left?

493
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,881
- Yes.
- Oh.

494
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,245
Well, then, why weren't
you representing him

495
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,805
on the Gillie Industries takeover?

496
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,810
Because he wasn't
technically our client at the time.

497
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,207
Well, if you're on such good terms,
why wasn't he a client?

498
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,404
Because sometimes brothers fight.

499
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,047
And sometimes they pretend to fight.

500
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,441
What are you getting at?

501
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,403
I'm getting at the fact
that you supposedly

502
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,760
were fighting when this thing started,

503
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,406
yet you claim that you weren't fighting
when it ended.

504
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,329
Who says we weren't
fighting when it ended?

505
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,965
You did, when you hired him back.

506
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,051
Yeah, and the Cowboys signed Deion
Sanders, even though they were rivals.

507
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,127
You want to know why?

508
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,369
'Cause he was awesome, and they were
tired of him intercepting their passes.

509
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,205
He didn't intercept passes for you.
He fumbled the ball.

510
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,450
- Bullshit. He hit it out of the park.
- What park are you playing at?

511
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,848
He sides with Walter Gillie,
buys a ton of shares,

512
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,200
then ditches poor Walter,

513
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,845
and then walks away
from the whole thing.

514
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,849
Why would you even want a guy
like this on your team?

515
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,847
What am I missing?

516
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,850
You're missing the fact that
he kicked ass his first time out,

517
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,445
and anybody would
be lucky to have him.

518
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,961
SEAN: Then why didn't
anybody take him?

519
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,007
What?

520
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,646
I checked with every
major law firm in the city,

521
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,768
and not one of them
received a resume from you.

522
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,611
Why is that?
Because it's clear as day.

523
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,081
You're hiding something,
and I'll tell you what it is.

524
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,248
It's because you always
knew that he was coming back,

525
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,931
because you and he were
in this together the whole time.

526
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,088
The problem with your
theory is neither one of us

527
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,488
got a nickel from this alleged collusion,
and you've got no proof we did.

528
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,604
Yeah, and you're never gonna find any,
because it doesn't exist.

529
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,843
So you're both insisting that neither one
of you got any money?

530
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,200
Damn right.

531
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,129
That tells me that someone else did.

532
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,367
Thank you, gentlemen.

533
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,529
I believe you showed me
where I should focus my manpower.

534
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,041
Somewhere in those
files there's a payment

535
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,891
from somewhere to someone,
and I'm gonna find it,

536
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,128
because you can't hide
money from the SEC.

537
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,848
Son of a bitch.

538
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,883
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?

539
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,082
About Louis making
a dirty deal with Forstman.

540
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,601
- He told you.
- He thought I already knew.

541
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,764
He found out we were together,

542
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,645
and unlike you, he assumed
that people in relationships

543
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,366
- share shit like that.
- Goddamn ticking time bomb.

544
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,811
Do you hear yourself?

545
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,364
I'm coming to you with a problem
between you and me,

546
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,806
and you're focused on Louis.

547
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,122
I'm focused on Louis,
because right now his actions

548
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,446
threaten this entire firm.

549
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,801
Which brings me right back
to where we started.

550
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,365
Why didn't you tell me about Louis

551
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,370
when I asked you
what the dirt on Woodall was for?

552
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,768
I didn't tell you
because I didn't want you

553
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,724
in the position of
having to lie for me in a deposition.

554
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,845
Is that "focused on you and me"
enough?

555
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,651
Jessica...

556
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,327
When are you gonna understand
that I can handle crossing lines,

557
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,568
but I won't handle you lying to me?

558
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,329
Now, how much trouble are we in?

559
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,169
That's what I'm gonna find out.

560
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,569
- Louis, did you see this?
- No, what is it?

561
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,648
It's Cahill's deposition
with Harvey and Mike.

562
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,961
Skip to the end.

563
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,641
Jesus Christ, he's honing in like a
bloodhound. It's only a matter of time.

564
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,321
There's got to be a way
we can get this filed...

565
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,527
There isn't.

566
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,211
- Louis.
- I'm done.

567
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,721
I'm done.

568
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,925
And if I don't do something now,
so are Harvey and Mike.

569
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,690
- Where are you going?
- To finish what I started.

570
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,011
- You know what I think?
- What?

571
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,600
I think we both could've used
a better lawyer in that deposition.

572
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,961
- You think this is funny?
- No, I don't.

573
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,889
Then help me figure a way out,

574
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,765
because if we don't,
they're gonna find out about Louis,

575
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,962
and everything Cahill's
been saying about us

576
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,411
is gonna start looking true.

577
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,488
We have to stop Cahill
from going through those files.

578
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,210
- We tried that.
- Then we have to try again.

579
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,971
We have to prove that Cahill
is only on this investigation

580
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,570
because Woodall hates you.

581
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,206
The problem is we don't
have a link between them.

582
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,209
And they have a link
between Jessica and Malone.

583
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,931
So we'd have to
convince Judge Hopkins

584
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,691
their relationship has nothing to do
with this whole thing,

585
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,565
which we'll never be able to do.

586
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,449
How do they even know
about Jessica and Malone?

587
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,210
I don't know.
Someone at the SEC must've

588
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,810
seen them together
while Malone was still working there.

589
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,921
You think they
were holding hands?

590
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,844
Come on, Harvey,
this is Jessica we're talking about.

591
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,846
- Talking about me, what?
- Holy shit, you're right.

592
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,928
She was married,
and I didn't even know it.

593
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,963
Cahill had us followed
without authorization.

594
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,003
And there's no way
he had authorization

595
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,724
to follow a government official.

596
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,405
MIKE: You need to pay that man a visit.

597
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,841
I need to pay that man a visit.

598
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,325
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
SEAN: Yep.

599
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,888
Oh, sorry, maybe
you didn't hear the news.

600
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,525
Jeff Malone doesn't work here anymore.

601
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,971
And I'm guessing you
know exactly where he is,

602
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,570
since you've been
following him for months.

603
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,490
I haven't been following him at all.
I've been following you.

604
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,568
Well, it doesn't really
matter who you followed,

605
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,489
since there's no way
you got authorization.

606
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,887
You think Judge Hopkins
is going to look into

607
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,611
those dreamy brown eyes of yours
and drop the case because of that?

608
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,007
No, I think you're gonna drop it.

609
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,122
- Hmm.
- 'Cause if you don't,

610
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,006
it's no longer malicious prosecution.
It's abuse of power.

611
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,963
You did it to Mike Ross,
you did it to me,

612
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,923
and we're gonna find out
who else you did it to.

613
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,930
Take a shot. It'll take you two
years to make a case,

614
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,441
and even if it sticks,
I'll get a slap on the wrist,

615
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,921
but Harvey Specter
will already be in prison.

616
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,884
You dirty son of a bitch.

617
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,527
Dirty? I may bend the rules,

618
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,529
but I'm doing it
because you are guilty.

619
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,928
That's exactly what Eric Woodall said
before we got his ass fired.

620
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,691
Well, I'll tell you what I told Harvey.
I'm not Eric Woodall.

621
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,404
And sending some
guy named Louis Litt

622
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,525
to confess to some fabricated bullshit
isn't gonna make me stop.

623
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,768
It's gonna make me
come at you harder.

624
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,889
Maybe no news is good news.

625
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,320
All right, maybe no news
means bad news.

626
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,844
When it comes to Jessica,
no news is no news.

627
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,642
- Harvey, you have a minute?
- What do you want, Louis?

628
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,606
- I'd prefer to tell you alone.
- Mike knows everything, so spit it out.

629
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,087
Okay, um, but I think
you both should know

630
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,089
that whatever happens to me,

631
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,487
I had the dignity to come to you
and tell you like a man.

632
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,967
- What did you do?
- He did exactly what I told him not to do.

633
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,731
He went to the SEC, and he confessed.

634
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,571
- LOUIS: Wait, Jessica, please.
- JESSICA: Please what? Don't kill you?

635
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,250
Because one thing is for sure.

636
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,045
When all this is over,
I'm gonna fire the shit out of you.

637
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,764
Fire me?

638
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,602
You should be thanking me.
I read the transcript.

639
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,884
Cahill knows about the hidden payment.
I went there to save all of you!

640
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,241
And I told you
the second you did that,

641
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,365
these two go from being probably
innocent to definitely guilty.

642
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,205
- Goddamn idiot.
- Wait a second. We...

643
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,729
Louis, if you confessed,
then why are you here?

644
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,842
- They sent me home.
- What?

645
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,201
- What exactly did you say to Cahill?
- I didn't talk to Cahill.

646
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,850
I mean, I was in his office,

647
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,883
but then Eric Woodall comes in,
takes me down the hall.

648
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,081
I confessed to him.

649
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,050
You told the head of the SEC
you committed a federal crime,

650
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,168
- and he sent you on your way?
- Yes.

651
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,691
And he didn't try to get
you to implicate Harvey?

652
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,962
No. In fact, he didn't seem
to care at all.

653
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,447
And you specifically told him
about your deal with Forstman?

654
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,291
Yeah. He said they're not interested
in little fish like me.

655
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,688
You might be a little fish to him,
but Forstman is a goddamn whale.

656
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,525
It doesn't matter.
Woodall hates me. I'm the one he wants.

657
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,163
But why not use Forstman to reel you in
and get two for the price of one?

658
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,648
Unless for some reason Woodall
doesn't want to drag Forstman into this.

659
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,128
Because they're in bed together.
That's a big leap.

660
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,527
Harvey, you said you told Forstman
the SEC was on his ass,

661
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,847
and he acted like he was
wearing a teflon suit.

662
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,521
- He acted the same way with me.
- And when assholes act invincible,

663
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,210
it's because they think they are.

664
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,243
It's the only thing that makes sense.

665
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,001
You two find the link between those two,
and find it tonight.

666
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,970
This could be something.
Look.

667
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,850
In April of last year, Charles Forstman
made huge contributions

668
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,807
- to these three senators.
- So what? He's got money to burn.

669
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,809
Yeah, but four weeks later,
these same senators

670
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,969
helped appoint Eric Woodall
to head the New York office of the SEC.

671
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,845
That doesn't prove a direct link
between Forstman and Woodall.

672
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,645
- It's still a link, Harvey.
- And it's how this shit works.

673
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,683
It's totally legal,
and it's not gonna do a thing for us.

674
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,687
Well, what do you want?

675
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,689
A picture of him handing
Woodall a bag of money?

676
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,371
- Because we're never gonna get that.
- Maybe we don't need it.

677
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,444
You better be here with something good.

678
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,366
LOUIS: I am.

679
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,842
Charles Forstman
made me take a million dollars

680
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,121
to keep from turning on him.

681
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,768
Maybe he made
Woodall take a taste, too?

682
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,726
You think we don't know that?
That's the "bag of money" problem.

683
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,001
It wouldn't be a bag of money,

684
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,566
because if it's untraceable,
he wouldn't have leverage over Woodall.

685
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,684
That's great, but we can't get access
to Woodall's bank accounts.

686
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,531
We can't. But Cahill can.

687
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,971
Okay, what good
does that do us, huh?

688
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,731
- They're together.
- What if they're not?

689
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,323
I told you, I went to see Cahill.
He wasn't there.

690
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,965
Five minutes later,
Eric Woodall shows up.

691
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,650
I say two words, "Charles Forstman."

692
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,649
He hustles me outta there
like I'm his mistress

693
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,044
with his wife coming up the driveway.
Why would he not wait for Cahill?

694
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,960
You want us to get
Cahill to turn on Woodall?

695
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,686
- Damn right, I do.
- MIKE: Maybe Louis is right.

696
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,770
Maybe there are lines that Woodall's
willing to cross that Cahill won't.

697
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,245
That's a big "maybe."

698
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,245
You have a better idea?

699
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,041
No, I don't.

700
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,846
Look, guys, we all know
that Jessica's gonna fire me after this.

701
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,809
I just want to help, make things right.

702
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,324
Get your coat.

703
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,086
You really looking
through those all by yourself?

704
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,564
Are the Witches of Eastwick here
to tell me how to run my department?

705
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,085
We're here to make
things easier for you.

706
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,167
Oh.

707
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,443
Buried in one of these boxes
is a copy of this.

708
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,686
It proves collusion.

709
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:34,089
Not between me and Mike.
Between him and Charles Forstman.

710
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,762
- And you're just gonna give this to me?
- Yup.

711
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,406
And you're gonna give it to Woodall,
and we're gonna see what he says.

712
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,487
And what he's gonna say is

713
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,762
that he doesn't give a shit
about Charles Forstman,

714
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,450
just like he told me
when I confessed to him.

715
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,927
- What exactly are you implying?
- We're not implying anything.

716
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,128
HARVEY: We're telling you
that after Woodall lost his job,

717
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,402
Forstman got him installed at the SEC,

718
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,569
and all he had to do in return
was protect Forstman.

719
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,291
- Where's the proof?
- In Eric Woodall's bank accounts.

720
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,768
Oh, so you want me to go through his
bank accounts based on your word?

721
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,884
- You followed us based on his bullshit.
- Based on the word of my friend.

722
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,604
Why don't you ask your friend
if he has a problem

723
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,165
giving you access to his accounts?

724
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,884
If he doesn't, then we're wrong,

725
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,604
and we've just handed
you the smoking gun.

726
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,721
And if you're right,

727
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,081
you want me to let him
off the hook for what he did.

728
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,407
HARVEY: Woodall already said
he's a little fish.

729
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,000
We're asking you
to throw him back in the water.

730
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,242
What the hell's going on here?

731
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,283
LOUIS: Hey, Eric.
It's good to see you again.

732
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,970
Sean, isn't this great
that we're all together?

733
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,970
Did you see me come in?
Afraid of what I'd say?

734
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,089
I have no idea what you're talking about.

735
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,090
Eric, these gentlemen came in here
with these wild accusations

736
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,441
that you and Charles Forstman
are in bed together.

737
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,767
A bed filled with Forstman's money.

738
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,601
Yes, Charles Forstman
gave me millions of dollars.

739
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,603
That's why I drive a Subaru.

740
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,603
Yeah, I didn't spend
the money he gave me either.

741
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,125
That doesn't mean
he didn't make me take it.

742
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,163
I don't give a shit. I'm not you.

743
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,931
SEAN: Eric, obviously
these allegations are crazy.

744
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,089
- Of course they are.
- So just...

745
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,762
Prove it to 'em
you've got nothing to hide.

746
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,920
This is ridiculous.

747
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,091
(STUTTERS) I am not gonna dignify...

748
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,320
I'm your boss.

749
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,047
- Gentlemen, give me a minute.
- Yep.

750
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,646
And by a minute,
he means 10 to 15 years.

751
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,406
In about a half an hour,
you're gonna need a really good lawyer.

752
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,649
And when that happens,
don't call me.

753
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,646
Which lawyer do you think
Woodall called?

754
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,411
Well, if he was smart,
he would call Daniel Hardman.

755
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,488
The best person
to defend a criminal is a criminal.

756
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,443
And Hardman's a much better
lawyer than you anyways.

757
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,324
Oh, very funny.

758
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,641
Thank you.

759
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,730
Thank you, Louis.

760
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,166
Please.

761
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,245
I'll try.

762
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,409
Donna told me she
already said this to you,

763
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,443
but I want you to hear it from me.

764
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,524
I wouldn't be back here
if it wasn't for Louis.

765
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,646
I'll take care of it.

766
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,768
Woodall's taken care of,
and so is everything else.

767
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,082
- Not everything.
- Jessica...

768
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,885
Harvey, I've already
made up my mind.

769
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,925
You weren't there.
He helped get us out of this.

770
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,487
- After he put us goddamn in it.
- And I put us in it just as much,

771
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,005
the day I hired Mike Ross.

772
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,920
Are you looking to save Louis,
or to get yourself fired, too?

773
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,364
I'm saying he did some bad shit,
but so have I, and so have you.

774
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,968
You and I don't mess shit up.
We fix it.

775
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,845
- Which is what he did today.
- You want to talk about what he did?

776
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,689
I told him not to confess, and
he went straight down to the SEC,

777
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,450
and he sang like a canary,

778
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,642
after he did the same
thing with Jeff Malone.

779
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,125
- That doesn't...
- Doesn't what?

780
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,723
That's just the tip of the iceberg.
Let's talk about his greatest hits.

781
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,491
Last year, he blew up our merger
negotiations because of a cat.

782
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,287
This year, he led Mike Ross
straight to Charles Forstman.

783
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,688
He unwound the Wexler shares
after I specifically told him not to,

784
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,564
and to top it all off,

785
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,524
he took a million-dollar
payout to commit tax fraud

786
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,166
that could've landed you
10 years in jail.

787
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,681
And he didn't tell us
about that until it was too late,

788
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,962
and he only did that
because he had to.

789
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,686
- I'm still not doin' it.
- I tell him to do something,

790
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,723
and he never goddamn does it.

791
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,888
Now, I told myself
I'm gonna do something.

792
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,842
And I'm gonna goddamn do it.

793
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,726
Then let me do it.

794
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,410
Why you and not me?

795
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,688
Because you want to
deliver the message

796
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,567
"His services are no longer needed,"
and I want to tell him "Good-bye."

797
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,970
You're really going to do this?

798
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,446
- Harvey, this place is all he has.
- I know.

799
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,731
I'm coming with you.

800
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,686
LOUIS: Dear Harvey and Jessica,

801
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,646
there comes a time when a man
must look at himself in the mirror,

802
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,843
to judge himself instead
of waiting to be judged by others.

803
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,723
And for me, that time is now.

804
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,084
You both know
I came to Pearson Specter

805
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,249
right out of law school,
but what you may not know is

806
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,569
this is the only
place I've ever worked.

807
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,961
Itk the only place
I've ever wanted to work.

808
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,568
It is my life.

809
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,245
It is my home.

810
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,565
And the people that
work here are my family.

811
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,811
You 're like my parents.

812
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,482
And the partners,
they're like my brothers,

813
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,683
and associates under
my care are like my children.

814
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,689
And I'm ashamed to admit it, but,

815
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,724
<i>I put all of you in jeopardy
for my own personal gain.</i>

816
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,010
I told myself it was
for the greater good,

817
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,444
but the truth is I just wanted to feel
on the same level as both of you, I...

818
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,689
I can deny that no longer.

819
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,326
I can excuse my actions no longer.

820
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,689
Although we've had
our differences over the years,

821
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,088
there are no two
people I respect more.

822
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,406
Your names are
on the wall for a reason,

823
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,250
and mine is not for a reason.

824
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,688
And I refuse to put either one of you

825
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,087
through the pain
of having to fire me.

826
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,808
So, effective immediately,
I, Louis Litt,

827
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,807
am resigning
from Pearson Specter.

828
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,250
Please take care of my home.
