7
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,060
Previously on "Arrow"...

8
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,430
I'm sorry, I--

9
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,310
I should go.

10
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,660
The night of the siege,

11
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,980
you were at the train station.

12
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,480
I got attacked by one of those crazy masked things,

13
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,700
but he got shot by a cop, I think.

14
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,220
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

15
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,130
He's dead.

16
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
Thank you, dad.

17
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,030
I promised you, Thea.

18
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,050
I will never let anyone hurt you.

19
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,410
Sara Lance is dead?

20
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,100
- Yes. - At Merlyn's hand?

21
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,940
It appears.

22
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,390
Al Sa-her will face the league's justice.

23
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,800
What of Queen?

24
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,160
He has sworn to protect Merlyn at any cost.

25
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,280
If that is true...

26
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,550
then Oliver Queens courts war with us.

28
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,790
Merry Christmas.

29
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,370
Merry Christmas.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,210
Well, I feel bad. I didn't get you anything.

31
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,630
You keep the city safe.

32
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:16,740
So do you.

33
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,480
You know, these days,

34
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,590
you're the closest thing to a partner I got.

35
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,220
Happy holidays.

36
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:25,720
Here you go, buddy.

37
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,500
Merlyn!

38
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,170
Nyssa.

39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,370
What is this?

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,840
- We agreed! - To nothing.

41
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,710
My father merely decided to give you the time

42
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,110
to bring Sara's killer to justice, and you have failed.

43
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,940
We are doing everything that we can!

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
You've been distracted protecting the city.

45
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,650
And you've exhausted my father's patience.

46
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,760
In civilizations past,

47
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,210
when someone in the village was murdered,

48
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,200
the League would come and kill 50 people a day

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
until the true criminal was rooted out.

50
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,340
Find and deliver the one who killed Ta-er Al Sah-fer.

51
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,940
You have 48 hours, or the citizens of Starling

52
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,120
will see what the League of Assassins is capable of.

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,630
You're going to slaughter innocent people.

54
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,170
The cleansing of Starling City will fall to Sarab.

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,150
Maseo?

56
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,840
Maseo is no longer.

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,070
As she said... I am Sarab.

58
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,460
Deliver Sara's killer

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,770
or blood will flow in your streets.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,120
This isn't what Sara would want!

61
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,620
Sara is dead.

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,610
It's time you remember that.

63
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,960
Dad's ok. Working too much.

65
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,950
Sorry.

66
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,030
I never really know what to say when I come here. I just...

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,040
I wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas,

68
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,360
and tell you how much I miss you.

69
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,270
Laurel?

70
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,510
Thea.

71
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,750
What are you doing here?

72
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,070
I was just leaving flowers for my mom.

73
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,590
Who were you talking to?

74
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,030
Nobody.

75
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,120
I just come here... sometimes.

76
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,620
Even though Sara's still alive?

77
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,710
Laurel, what--what's wrong?

78
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,100
Everything's fine. Sara's ok.

79
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,450
No, Thea.

80
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,520
Sara's dead.

81
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,120
What?

82
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,330
What are you talking about?

83
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,540
While you were gone,

84
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,220
she was murdered.

85
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,480
By who?

86
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,850
I don't know. I buried her here.

87
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,420
Why didn't you tell anybody, like at least your father,

88
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,770
- the police? - No, no.

89
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,170
Thea, no one can ever know.

90
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,140
Why?

91
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,620
Just...

92
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,970
Sara, she was,,

93
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,640
she was complicated.

94
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,030
And if my father found out,

95
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,910
it would kill him.

96
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,930
You have to promise me that you won't tell Oliver.

97
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,180
Of course, I--I promise.

98
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,130
I'm so sorry.

100
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,620
Did you know there's a cafeteria in the building?

101
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,330
There's a cold press juice bar,

102
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,030
- organic salad station. - I know.

103
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,740
I eat there every day,

104
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,440
along with 800 of your other employees.

105
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,480
Now, if you'll excuse me,

106
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm late for a meeting.

107
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,880
Wait, Felicity! Are we ok?

108
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,770
If by "we" you mean you and me

109
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,380
as individual entities, then yes, we are fantastic.

110
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,140
This is about the kiss.

111
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,240
This is not about the kiss.

112
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,000
You sure? Cause it really feels like it's about the kiss.

113
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,250
Unless it's about how I left after the kiss.

114
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,990
- I can explain. - No.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,070
I can explain.

116
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,740
It was a moment and you regret it.

117
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,100
It's over. Now can we please pretend like it never happened

118
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,670
and go back to being professionals?

120
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,070
I have to go.

121
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:47,940
Work.

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,050
But you're at work.

123
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,280
What happened?

124
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,800
Nyssa paid me a visit.

125
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,420
The League wants Sara's killer handed over in the next 48 hours.

126
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,250
Why do I sense there's an "or else"

127
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,630
at the end of that sentence?

128
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,810
Or else they'll start killing innocent civilians.

129
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,970
Oh, my God, two days?

130
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,240
Caitlin has the DNA that we pulled off of the arrows

131
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,850
that killed Sara, but the STR markers are degraded,

132
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,740
so it's taking a little bit longer.

133
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,730
Felicity...

134
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,870
It can't take any longer.

135
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,200
If we can't find Sara's killer in time,

136
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,760
we're going to need a contingency plan.

137
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,920
I know.

138
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,330
I don't have one.

139
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,790
Here.

140
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,270
Oh, I'm not hungry.

141
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,310
The first time I interrogated someone,

142
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,320
I lost my appetite for two days.

143
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,130
You need your strength.

144
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,610
I didn't interrogate anyone.

145
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,630
I tortured him.

146
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,620
The question is,

147
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,050
did you learn anything about Chien Na Wei's plans?

148
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,310
There's a biotech company in Hong Kong.

149
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,700
They were working on a super antibiotic.

150
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,160
They got a super virus instead.

151
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,270
They're calling it Oh Mei Gah,

152
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,770
which is the Chinese translation for...

153
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,640
Omega.

154
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,240
Said one vile could wipe out an entire city.

155
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:30,160
So it's a bio weapon Chien Na Wei's after.

156
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,950
Did he tell you where it is now?

157
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,560
Yeah.

158
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,140
He didn't want to, but I made him.

159
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,330
You did what was necessary.

160
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,120
One man's agony is not worth

161
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,860
the lives of an entire city.

163
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:49,690
But you're all right?

164
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,080
Okay. Yes, it is coming through now.

165
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,200
No, I'm fine. Things are just tense here.

166
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,820
Thank you, Caitlin.

167
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,270
Happy holidays to you, too.

168
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,230
Are those the DNA results?

169
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,520
It's the reassembled genome S.T.A.R. labs

170
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,230
was able to get off of the arrow that killed Sara.

171
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,100
I need to run it against potential suspects.

172
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,290
What database are you using?

173
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,470
SCPD maintains a genetic markers database.

174
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,010
Anyone's who committed a felony in the past three years.

175
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,550
No, that,

176
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,940
that can't be right.

177
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,160
- Who is it? - It must be a mistake.

178
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,250
Felicity! Who killed Sara?

180
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,000
You did.

182
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,510
This must be a mistake.

183
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,940
I took perspiration off the arrows that killed Sara.

184
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,850
Two years ago when the police arrested Oliver

185
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,090
because they thought, accurately, that he was the vigilante,

186
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,230
they took a DNA sample.

187
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,280
That sample is a match for 12 out of the 13 STRs.

188
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,990
The odds of that, they're possible.

189
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,000
Ok, so somehow my DNA is on the arrows.

190
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,280
Someone's setting you up, Oliver.

191
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,430
Well, somebody with a vested interest

192
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,400
in pitting me against the League of Assassins.

193
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,630
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

194
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,970
Merlyn was in Corto Maltese with Thea

195
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,690
- when this was going down. - Unless he wasn't.

196
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,160
I mean, Merlyn hid successfully for two years

197
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,330
from the police and the League.

198
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,580
He's good at covering his tracks.

199
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,700
So we uncover them.

200
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,250
But it might take some time.

201
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,160
In less than 48 hours, the League is going to murder 50 people.

202
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,160
We don't have time.

203
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,640
Move to the lab. I'll deal with

204
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,720
the rest of security.

205
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,580
Stay on comms.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,160
Maseo, are you set?

207
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,730
Just about.

208
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,970
Found Omega.

209
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,310
Be careful with it.

210
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,340
Yeah, we might have a problem.

211
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,410
What's wrong?

212
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,960
Somebody already took it.

213
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,150
How did she get in here before us?

214
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,360
She didn't need to get in, Oliver.

215
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,280
She already had someone inside.

216
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,890
Yeah, I know, but it's the holidays

217
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,320
and I guess I'm feeling charitable.

218
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,360
Is that ok?

219
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,850
Jake, I got to call you right back.

220
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,800
- Hey. - Hi!

221
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,200
Look who it is.

222
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,780
How was your ride down?

223
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,140
Oh, uneventful.

224
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,500
Chance to grade some papers.

225
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,710
Dad, maybe you can tell me why half your officers

226
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,470
are allergic to search warrants?

227
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,890
Mom!

228
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,140
Hi, sweetheart.

229
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,210
I didn't know that you were coming to town.

230
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,830
Well, I guess that's my fault,

231
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,010
'cause I thought you could do a little Christmas surprise.

232
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,890
Of course I want to spend Christmas with my family.

233
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,300
So where's Sara?

234
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,380
She's not returning my phone calls.

235
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,950
Uh, yeah, that's 'cause she's, uh, she's traveling.

236
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,250
Backpacking through the Andes.

237
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,590
- I think. - Yeah.

238
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:16,840
I found something!

239
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,770
A.R.G.U.S. monitors air

240
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,700
traffic in and out of countries of interest.

241
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,880
Corto Maltese is on that list.

242
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,530
This is a list of every commercial airliner,

243
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,440
private jet, sea plane, and, I'm not kidding,

244
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,960
hot air balloon that took off from Corto Maltese this past year.

245
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,560
Look at this flight path.

246
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,410
Private charter from Corto Maltese to Caracas,

247
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,430
then to Cartagena,

248
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,250
only to fly back to Caracas, and then to Tijuana.

249
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,950
Whoever was on that plane was

250
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,150
working pretty hard to hide where it was going.

251
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,600
The route ends at a private landing strip

252
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
just outside Starling City.

253
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,160
When did it land?

254
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,690
The night before Sara was murdered.

255
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,790
Please! All I do is fly the plane!

256
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,540
Quiet!

257
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,950
The man in this photo--

258
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,360
Did you fly him from Corto Maltese

259
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,140
- to Starling City? - No.

260
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,000
This time, look at the photo!

261
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,880
He'll kill me.

262
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,960
He's not here. We are.

263
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,730
All right, ok, yes, I flew him here.

264
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,620
I've got security footage, you want to see?

265
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,450
Hanukkah present?

266
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,710
Security footage from the airfield where Merlyn landed.

267
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,490
Check for October Seventh.

268
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,790
Right there, stop.

269
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,980
I thought you said Merlyn was keeping his distance from Thea,

270
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,420
that he hadn't had any contact.

271
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,450
He lied.

272
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,980
And so did she.

273
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,930
Maybe there's something we should consider here.

274
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,390
Maybe it wasn't your DNA, Oliver, maybe it was Thea's.

275
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,590
- What? - You two are siblings.

276
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,690
There would be overlap, maybe even enough to--

277
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,440
Diggle, are you listening to yourself?

278
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,930
You're suggesting that Thea killed Sara.

279
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,750
Even if--even if she would,

280
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,100
even if she could...

281
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,070
Why?

282
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,950
Well, Malcolm Merlyn is her father.

283
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,000
I hate to even say this.

284
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,020
Then don't.

285
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,380
Oliver...

286
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,710
I know how much you love your sister,

287
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,030
but we have to look at the facts.

288
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,010
The virtual autopsy I did on Sara,

289
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,240
I thought Roy might have stabbed her

290
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,840
because the trajectory wasn't consistent

291
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,180
with that of an archer of average height.

292
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,020
You were considering a killer of Thea's size.

293
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,280
Enough, both of you!

294
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,340
My sister did not kill Sara.

295
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,340
The DNA on the arrows is mine

296
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,770
because Malcolm Merlyn put it there.

297
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,620
Hi.

298
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,270
Hey, uh, we need to talk,

299
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,710
- so I came here. - Here where?

300
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,920
Where you are.

301
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,740
I might have pinged your phone...again.

302
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,030
I thought I was pretty clear

303
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,670
when I said I didn't want to talk about this.

304
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,420
You were.

305
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,780
But you were also pretty wrong

306
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,140
when you said I regretted kissing you.

307
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,240
I can't imagine there's a man on the planet

308
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,610
who would ever regret kissing you.

309
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,530
Well, I can think of one.

310
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,690
But I am sorry about the way I reacted.

311
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,940
When I kissed you, I felt guilty.

312
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,960
Oh, my god, you're cheating on someone.

313
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,050
No.

314
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,970
Her name is Anna,

315
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,830
and we were engaged.

316
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,390
Last spring, the night those men...

317
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,680
took over the city, we ran into a few.

318
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,070
We tried to escape, but we couldn't.

319
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,290
I tried to fight them, but I couldn't.

320
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,230
I wasn't strong enough. I...

321
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,820
they broke my leg,

322
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,740
and went after her,

323
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,640
but I couldn't save her.

324
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,860
And I watched them...

325
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,940
as they broke her neck.

326
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,340
Ray, I am so sorry.

327
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,650
Anna was supposed to be the last woman I ever kissed.

328
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,050
And she was,

329
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,300
until suddenly I was kissing you.

330
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,400
What are you doing home?

331
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,810
I wanted the Christmas tree to be a surprise.

332
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,490
It's a surprise.

333
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,110
I thought since it was just the two of us now,

334
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,990
smaller the family, bigger the tree.

335
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,880
What about Malcolm?

336
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,960
Thea, I know you saw him in Corto Maltese.

337
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:01,020
Ollie, we've lost everyone. I--

338
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,860
Malcolm's the only family I have left besides you.

339
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,590
Thea, I deserve to know

340
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,320
what you've been doing with Malcolm Merlyn.

341
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,450
I've just been getting to know him, that's all.

342
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,280
A couple of months ago,

343
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,440
did you fly back to Starling City with him?

344
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,450
No!

345
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,990
Ollie, if I was back in Starling City,

346
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,500
don't you think I would have called you?

347
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,070
I was in Corto Maltese since May.

348
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,160
Now will you please just...

349
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,990
come upstairs and help me find some more Christmas stuff?

350
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,720
Ok.

354
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,730
What's he saying?

355
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,640
He's trying to bribe us.

357
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,550
We want the vial of Omega you stole.

358
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,980
I don't know what you're talking about!

359
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,230
I didn't steal anything!

360
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,100
Don't waste your energy on lies.

361
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,250
We will get the truth from you--

362
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,870
one way or the other.

363
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,880
My friend can be very persuasive.

364
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,080
So, how are you?

365
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,540
I'm great. Work's great.

366
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,590
I--I've just been really busy.

367
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,770
Something's happened.

368
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,190
What? No. No, nothing's happened.

369
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,260
It's Sara.

370
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,620
Isn't it?

371
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,810
When I mentioned her earlier,

372
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,130
you seemed so...broken.

373
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,510
Mom, Sara's fine.

374
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,010
She's just being Sara.

375
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,950
There are few things as powerful as a mother's intuition.

376
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,740
You are hiding something. I know it.

377
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,950
Just like I was the only one

378
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,950
who knew that Sara didn't die on that boat.

379
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,710
I have this feeling that I would see her again.

380
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,770
And right now,

381
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,200
that feeling...

382
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,000
is gone.

383
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,770
She's dead...

384
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,360
isn't she?

385
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,660
Mom, listen to me.

386
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,160
Sara, she was involved with some very, very dangerous people.

387
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,960
This has to remain a secret,

388
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,370
at least until we figure out exactly what happened.

389
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,660
I don't understand.

390
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,230
Doesn't your father know?

391
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,840
If he knew about Sara...

392
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,880
he couldn't take it.

393
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,770
And I can't lose anyone else.

394
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,670
Father.

395
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,100
It's nearly time.

396
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,700
Mr. Queen has not yet presented the guilty?

397
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,160
Perhaps he believes our threats are empty.

398
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,280
We must correct that belief.

399
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,790
Return to Starling City.

400
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,410
Be merciless.

401
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:03,870
Teach Oliver Queen we only ask but once.

402
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,840
Where you been?

403
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,120
I went to see Thea.

404
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:13,210
She lied to me again, but she didn't kill Sara.

405
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:13,900
Oliver...

406
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,460
I looked her in the eyes, Felicity.

407
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,450
These are eyes that I have known my entire life.

408
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,920
She could lie to me about Merlyn

409
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,510
and spending time with him,

410
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,180
but she could never do this.

411
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,070
Oliver, you are one of the smartest men

412
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,490
I have ever known,

413
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,850
but you have a blind spot when it comes to your family.

414
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,010
- Not this time-- - First your mother, then your father,

415
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,920
- That's enough, Diggle! - And now Thea.

416
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,390
You know she lied to you, Oliver!

417
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,640
Both of you, stop!

418
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,680
Oliver,

419
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,740
I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you,

420
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,570
but John is right.

421
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,480
- Thea lied. - She lied about Merlyn!

422
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,920
But Sara...

423
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,280
I don't want to believe that she can do something like this.

424
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,470
Which is why you shouldn't be the one asking the questions.

425
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,610
Thea Queen!

426
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,080
Where is Malcolm Merlyn?

427
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,210
I don't know! Please, please don't hurt me!

428
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,040
Stay away from me and my father!

429
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,010
It's the strangest thing.

430
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,690
Thea just called

431
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,570
and said she was attacked by the Arrow.

433
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,820
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that,

434
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,430
now would you, Oliver?

435
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,120
This was you.

436
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,310
You know, I figured

437
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,040
when I spared the man who murdered my mother,

438
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,680
I would never kill again.

439
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,070
I was wrong.

440
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,070
- You might want to reconsider. - Why?!

441
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,350
For Thea.

442
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,930
Check your phone.

443
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,210
I can wait.

444
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,380
I don't think you want the League to see that.

445
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,460
And if you kill me, they will.

446
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,990
This isn't her.

447
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,030
Have you ever heard of a plant called Votura?

448
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,450
Grows in South America.

449
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,070
In fact, it thrives in Corto Maltese,

450
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,350
Making the subject extremely susceptible to suggestion,

451
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,060
or retaining no memory of their actions.

452
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,810
I will tell Ra's this was you, that Thea was under your control.

453
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,220
And he will still kill her. She fired the arrows.

454
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,130
You have given her a death sentence.

455
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,170
No.

456
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,430
What I've done is given you incentive.

457
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,750
To do what?

458
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,180
To tell Ra's that you killed Sara Lance.

459
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,830
By right, you will be given a trial by combat--

460
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,720
with Ra's.

461
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,230
His death will erase any blood debt from his reign,

462
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,430
including Thea's.

463
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,430
And yours.

464
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,190
I have to be honest--

465
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,210
it was my concern that the whole killing thing

466
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,940
would have been a dealbreaker for you.

467
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,690
But, uh, I'm gratified to see that Thea

468
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,350
is still sufficient motivation.

469
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,690
Don't take too long making up your mind.

470
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,970
Ra's isn't known for his patience.

472
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,670
Thea was always so kind.

473
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,760
Kindest person I've ever known.

474
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,760
My sister wasn't born a killer.

475
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,250
Malcolm Merlyn made her one,

476
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,720
and I let it happen.

477
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,100
No, you didn't.

478
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,120
When it comes to your family,

479
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,490
you always place the blame on yourself,

480
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,300
but this is not your fault.

481
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,520
She's right, Oliver.

482
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,300
Throw Malcolm in front of Ra's,

483
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,270
let the League sort this out.

484
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,070
Merlyn has a video.

485
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,080
He made contingencies.

486
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,870
Oliver, if you fight Ra's Al Ghul,

487
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,920
he'll kill you.

488
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,180
No, he won't.

489
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,510
During the undertaking, Merlyn told me

490
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,070
that I couldn't win,

491
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,000
because I didn't know what I was fighting for.

492
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,620
Now I do.

493
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,360
I'm fighting for Thea.

494
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,690
He should have confessed by now.

495
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,120
We have video evidence of him taking the vials.

496
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,050
He says he doesn't remember.

497
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,340
He's lying! You don't do something like that

498
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,590
- and not remember it! - There is a way.

499
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,090
I didn't think it a possibility until now.

500
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,930
There's a drug. It's called Votura.

501
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,490
I've heard it makes people extremely susceptible to suggestion.

502
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,580
Like mind control?

503
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,930
Really, that's a thing?

504
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,850
Those who get dosed often have no memory

505
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,790
of what they do while under the influence.

506
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,540
Oh, great. All this was for nothing?

507
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,300
Chien Na Wei has the vile,

508
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,560
and we have no way of finding her!

509
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,500
We've taken her inside man.

510
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,050
Finding her may not be the problem at hand.

511
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,090
The problem could be her finding us.

515
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,040
Hello, Mrs. Yamashiro. Is your husband home?

518
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,730
Don't you dare talk to my son!

519
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,930
Quaint house

520
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,430
for a spy.

521
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,780
Except for these.

522
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,910
They belong to you, don't they?

523
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,300
Tatsu, isn't it?

524
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,260
Beautiful blade.

526
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,650
Where is he?

527
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,550
You really think my father,

528
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,830
the demon's head, would travel all the way from Nanda Parbat

529
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,610
simply because you wished it?

530
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,750
Yes.

531
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,020
This way.

532
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,950
Kneel before the demon's head.

533
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,800
You're just a boy.

534
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,000
Well, Mr. Queen,

535
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,630
you failed to protect the city you love.

536
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,410
Now you'll watch it bleed.

537
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,910
Nobody in my city will die tonight.

538
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,820
There was only one way to prevent that.

539
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,930
You were to produce for me the one

540
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,120
who killed Ta-er Al Sah-fer.

541
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,530
And yet you've come alone.

542
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,530
Because it was me.

543
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,270
I killed Sara.

544
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,780
Why would you kill a woman you once professed to love?

545
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,460
Because she begged me to.

546
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,880
You lie.

547
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,500
It wasn't the first time

548
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,410
Sara chose death over a life in the League.

549
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,990
And meeting you now,

550
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,050
I can see why.

551
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,520
I should have Sarab cleave your head from your shoulders.

552
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,110
Not for killing my daughter's beloved,

553
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,580
but for thinking me a fool.

554
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,580
By League Law, I have the right

555
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,930
to challenge you to a trial by combat.

556
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,080
It's been 67 years since a man challenged me.

557
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,190
You covet death that much?

558
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,750
Do you accept?

559
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,310
Oh, yes.

560
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,860
I see the years have done little to dull your stubbornness.

561
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,680
- Maseo... - My name is Sarab!

562
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,410
You told me once a man cannot live by two names.

563
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,560
And I don't.

564
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,400
Maseo is dead.

565
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,320
I am all that's left, Sarab.

566
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,850
A phantom.

567
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:22,390
After it happened,

568
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,110
you went to Nanda Parbat.

569
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,780
I arrived the same year as Ta-er Al Sah-fer.

570
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,470
She was a great warrior.

571
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,030
You did not kill her.

572
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,860
When you face the demon,

573
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,900
it will be my duty to bear witness.

574
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,460
I have no desire to watch you die.

575
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,440
Under our code,

576
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,870
you have 12 hours to settle your affairs.

577
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,040
The 13th hour, be at this place.

578
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,160
This location is consecrated ground for the League.

579
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,480
A place for the settlement of blood debts--

580
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,040
If one survives the climb.

581
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,080
If you do.

582
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,090
See you on the mountain.

583
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,770
Do you remember how when the two of you were little,

584
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,460
you'd play dress up?

586
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,280
One day I overheard you and Sara.

587
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,390
You were pretending to be grown-up versions of yourselves.

588
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,180
That day, you and your sister,

589
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,230
you had your own families.

590
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,870
Careers.

591
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,540
I was a cop, just like dad.

592
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,220
- And Sara... - Was a doctor.

593
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,170
She wanted to heal people.

594
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,360
She deserves more than this.

595
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,610
Mom, can I tell you something?

596
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,600
Whoever did this to Sara,

597
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,580
I am going to find them no matter what it takes.

598
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,030
And I am going to make them pay.

599
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,550
Then you make them pay.

600
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,160
And you make them suffer.

601
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,510
Looks good.

602
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,870
That window should be as good as new.

603
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,930
Thank you.

604
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,430
What happened to the window?

605
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,210
Oh, god, you should have seen it.

606
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,790
This bird went completely Hitchcock on the thing.

607
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,410
I vacuumed up most the glass,

608
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,910
but I'd still watch your step.

609
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,290
I'll be extra careful.

610
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,670
Are you ok?

611
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,660
Last time you had that look on your face,

612
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,590
you told me dad committed suicide.

613
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:41,950
You haven't called him dad

614
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,480
since you found out about Malcolm.

615
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,590
What's going in with you, Ollie?

616
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,940
You think you know who Malcolm Merlyn is.

617
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,890
But there are things that I've discovered,

618
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:55,090
years ago, recently, that...

619
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,950
he doesn't love you, Thea.

620
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,280
Because he's not capable of it.

621
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,860
Ollie, please.

622
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,930
Don't.

623
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,570
Don't make me choose between my father

624
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,960
and my brother.

625
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,940
I would never make you choose.

626
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,270
You are my family.

627
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,000
There's nothing that I won't do to protect you.

628
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,900
What does that mean?

629
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,310
It means I love you,

630
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,230
no matter what.

631
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,770
Tatsu?

632
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,260
Akio! What happened here?

633
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,240
Oh, god, no. No, no, no!

634
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,620
Akio, no!

635
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,320
- Daddy! - Akio!

636
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,280
Akio, where is your mother?

637
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,230
The white-haired woman! She took her!

638
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,780
Guess who just designed a microprocessor

639
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,910
with a SPECint score just north of 9,000?

640
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,760
Ray...what are you doing

641
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,010
with Queen Consolidated? Why did you buy it?

642
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,560
Because it was for sale.

643
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,240
My life is a little more complicated than I let on.

644
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,040
Suffice it to say, I have gotten very good at keeping secrets,

645
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,090
particularly the kind of secrets someone like you keeps.

646
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,560
Someone in pain.

647
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,130
Wasn't easy for me to tell you about Anna.

648
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,610
You told me about Anna, but you didn't tell me the truth

649
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,930
about what it is you're doing.

650
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,120
So tell me, or I walk.

651
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,640
I can't tell you.

652
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,590
I have to show you.

653
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,700
The dawn of the computer age,

654
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,750
developers thought the only way a machine

655
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,320
could process information as fast as a human brain

656
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,460
was to build a mainframe the size of Texas.

657
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,730
But one developer realized that the only way

658
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,400
to reduce heat and power consumption

659
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,720
was to bring the components closer together.

660
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,300
Which meant making them smaller.

661
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,880
But why stop at computers?

662
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,220
What if it could take other things,

663
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,740
like, say, all of the military-grade technology

664
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,820
in applied sciences,

665
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,150
and make it smaller, too? So small

667
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,630
that it can fit in the palm of my hand.

668
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,390
I can help a lot of people that way.

669
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:20,720
- I don't understand. - This will help.

670
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,810
- What is it? - OMAC

671
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,900
is a queen consolidated designation.

672
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,030
But I'm kind of partial to A.T.O.M.

673
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,230
Advanced Technology Operating Mechanism.

674
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,560
A.T.O.M.

675
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,990
What are you going to use it for?

676
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,760
To protect the people of this city.

677
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,280
And I want you to help me.

678
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,010
Why does this keep happening to me?

679
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,800
Oliver...

680
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,200
John, I have to do this.

681
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,670
I know.

682
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,000
I'd just rather die than let you go it alone.

683
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,600
Not this time.

684
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,090
- Take care of Thea. - Absolutely.

685
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,050
I'm sorry.

686
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,470
Something came up...

687
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,970
No.

688
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,280
Let's give them a minute.

689
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,400
So you're going?

690
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,500
To Nanda Parbat?

691
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,180
No, it's a neutral site.

692
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:33,690
It'll be fine. I'll come back.

693
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,430
Thea will be OK.

694
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,110
I wish that sounded more convincing.

695
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,590
And I wish you wouldn't go, but I know you better,

696
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,310
so I'm not going to ask you to stay.

697
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,130
I appreciate that.

698
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,800
But there is one thing

699
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,030
I need to ask you to do.

700
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,170
And you're not going to want to.

701
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,210
Well, if it's you asking, I'll do it.

702
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,230
Kill him.

703
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,970
You have to kill Ra's Al Ghul.

704
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,790
This is a duel... Oliver,

705
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,990
with one of the most

706
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,330
dangerous men that has ever walked the earth.

707
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,440
I wouldn't be doing it if I didn't think I could win.

708
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,810
I don't doubt that. I don't doubt that you can beat him.

709
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,160
I am terrified that you won't kill him.

710
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,730
Because that's not who you are anymore.

711
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,380
And I am so afraid that Ra's Al Ghul

712
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,750
is going to use your humanity against you.

713
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,410
Felicity, I honestly don't know

714
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,750
if I'm a killer anymore.

715
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,920
But I do know two things--

716
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,930
The first is that...

717
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,340
whoever I am,

718
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,080
I am someone that will do whatever-- whatever--

719
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,050
it takes to save my sister.

720
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,910
And the second thing?

721
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,090
I love you.

722
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,890
Remove your shirt.

723
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,200
This is custom.

724
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,500
Ra's Al Ghulis not know to be merciful.

725
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,860
But if there was a chance,

726
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,720
this will be your final moment for it.

727
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,560
Choose your weapon.

728
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,330
I was 11 years old when I killed my first man.

729
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,250
I remember the look in his face

730
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,450
when the light went out behind his eyes.

731
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,390
Such a sudden change,

732
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,130
almost imperceptible,

733
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,580
between life and death.

734
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,620
And I felt ashamed.

735
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,650
I had stolen from that man

736
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,500
the most precious gift of all--

737
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,840
life.

738
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,680
But I also felt something else--

739
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,710
pride,

740
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,670
because I had taken up arms against someone

741
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,110
who sought to do ill against my family.

742
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,410
And I realized what I had done was necessary.

743
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,280
You see...

744
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,280
I had replaced evil with death.

745
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,880
And that...

746
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,880
is what the League exists to do.

747
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,110
And I have killed several thousand more men since then.

748
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,750
And the world is better off for it.

749
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,760
You've taken your last life.

750
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,360
No.

751
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,020
You have lived your last day.

752
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,050
We are ready.

753
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,240
I am envious of you.

754
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,930
You will see her before I do.

755
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,380
Fight me, boy.

756
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,350
You're unnarmed.

757
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,350
I'll take your blades from you once you are through with them.

758
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,530
You should take pride.

759
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:43,410
You survived longer than most.

760
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,770
Don't be afraid, my son.

761
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,740
Death comes for us all.

762
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,770
We can only evade it so long.

763
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,190
Consider this an honorable exit.
