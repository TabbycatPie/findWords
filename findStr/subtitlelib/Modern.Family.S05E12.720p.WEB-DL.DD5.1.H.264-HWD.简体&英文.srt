老天  我真的得去学习

亲爱的  你就不能抽出点时间享用吗

这可是你的生日啊
It's your birthday.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,810
你给自己施加太多压力了
You put too much pressure on yourself.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,500
我还记得我16岁那年
I remember my sweet 16.

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,800
我想要个主题派对
I wanted a theme party.

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,020
《月色撩人》刚刚上映  但我还没出柜
"Moonstruck" had just come out, but I hadn't, so --

9
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,440
别讲故事  没时间听
No stories, no time --

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,230
我是要考大学入学考试的人啊
S.A.T.s.

11
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,600
来吧  各位
Here we go, everybody.

等等  等等
Wait, wait.

我们都知道在庆祝什么
We all know why we're here.

14
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,870
-亲爱的  你落下了一根  -我知道
- Ay, honey, you missed one. - I know!

15
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,220
我知道我落下了一根  我不是傻子
I know I missed one! I'm not an idiot!

16
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,450
这样  开心了吧
There! Happy?!

17
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,840
-你有点...  -失控是吗
- You're being a little... - Obstreperous?!

18
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,480
顽抗  还是野蛮
Recalcitrant?! Truculent?!

19
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,030
我本来想说"神经兮兮"
I was gonna say "Cray-cray."

20
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,850
艾丽克斯  亲爱的
Alex, sweet...

21
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,050

I really need to focus!

22

有个16岁的科学天才

24
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,690
16岁  瞧瞧我在干什么
16! What am I doing?!

25
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,750
我在吃蛋糕
I'm eating cake!

26
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,390
别这样  别这样
No, no, no.

27

第五季 第十二集

39
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,300
艾丽克斯在昨晚过后  可能会有点脆弱
Alex might be a little bit fragile after last night,

40
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,480
所以我们得小心对待她
so let's try to be sensitive.

41
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,930
相信我  从现在起
Oh, believe me -- I am going to be

42
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,910
我都会对她耐心又友好
nothing but nice to Alex from now on.

43
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,370
如果她哪天突然崩溃  实施暴行
If she snaps and goes on a rampage,

44
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,790
你觉得她会最先找上谁
who do you think she's coming for first?

45
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,670
她不会实施暴行的
She's not going on a rampage.

46
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,370
我赌她会留我一命  她喜欢我
I bet she'd let me live. She likes me.

47
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,020
坦白说  我从不信任她
I'm just gonna say it -- I never trusted her.

48
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,370
大家都正常一点就行了
Oh, everybody just be normal.

49
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,450
我们要像平时那样对她
We're gonna treat her exactly the way we usually do.

50
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,940
她来了
And there she is.

51
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,340
-美女  -你睡得怎么样
- Hi, pretty girl. - How'd you sleep?

52
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,620
-不错  -你的头发看起来超柔软  小艾
- Fine. - Your hair looks super-soft, Al.

53
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,650
那是新的毛衣吗  超爱
And is that a great new sweater? Love!

54
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,650
老爸  你能把黄油刀递给我吗
Dad, can you hand me the butter knife?

55
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,610
不行
No!

56
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,590

谢谢
Thanks.

59
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,010
好吧  谈谈我昨晚的失控
So, about my meltdown.

60
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,200
-谁  -什么失控
- Who? - What meltdown?

61
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,290
我想去看心理医生  我查了一下
I want to see a therapist. I did some research.

62
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,030
格雷戈里・克拉克医生  超高推荐度
Dr. Gregory Clark -- highly recommended,

63
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,950
专治青少年  在我们的医保范围内
specializes in teenagers, and is covered by our insurance.

64
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,470
我预约了今天找他看两个钟
I booked a double session with him today.

65
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,960
既然你们今天要参加学校开放日
And since you guys have the open house,

66
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,990
我自己坐公交去
I will be taking the bus.

67
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,920
-好  -听起来不错
- Okay. - That sounds good.

68
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,490
她简直像个自动清洁炉
She's like a self-cleaning oven.

69
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,350
快看看
Check it out.

70
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,590
我今天要以复古造型亮相开放日
I'm rockin' the old school for the open house today.

71
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,600
我要为体育课重新注入活力
I'm gonna put the "Fizz" back in "Phys Ed."

72
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,600
[小卡的艺名是"Fizzbo"菲茨宝]

73
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,350
我喜欢  全都喜欢
I love it -- all of it.

74
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,130
-真的吗  -当然
- Really? - Yeah.

75
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,360
因为我今天想给家长们留下个好印象
Because I want to make a good impression today.

76
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,590
我想成为所有家长谈论的对象
I want to be the teacher all the parents are talking about.

77
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,950
是啊  难怪穿这袜子
Well, that explains the socks.

78
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,930
什么
What?

79
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,770
学校里有一种等级制度
There's a caste system at school --

80
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,990
学术教师在顶层  体育教师在底层
Academic teachers at the top, gym teachers at the bottom.

81
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,660
真的很讨厌  也很无礼
It's offensive and disrespectful.

82
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,360
他们像对待服务员一样对待我们
They treat us like we're lunch ladies.

83
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,820
你好啊  邻居
Hey, there, neighbor.

84
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,230
-是亚瑟  对吧  -没错
- It's Asher, right? - Yeah.

85
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,600
我就是想告诉你
Um, I just wanted to let you know --

86
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,670
我觉得你们家的空调
I think there might be something

87
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,520
-可能坏了  -是吗
- wrong with your air conditioner. - Oh, really?

88
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,040
是啊  好像总是开着
Yeah, I mean, it just seems to be running a lot,

89
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,440
即便屋外还挺凉快的
even when it's, uh, kind of cool outside.

90
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,720
不是  不是
No, no.

91
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,480
我家那位有点怕热
Um, my partner runs a little hot.

92
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,880
那也没我们这个地球热
Not as hot as our planet.

93
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,000
抱歉  我没想那么刻薄
Sorry. I don't mean to be that guy.

94
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,320
只是  我们都在一个星球上
It's just, um, we're all in this together.

95
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,180
是啊  我开的是普锐斯车  所以
Yeah, I drive a Prius, so...

96
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,590
这倒是个不错的态度
And that's a nice little gesture.

97
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,460
我的车用的是回收的食用油
My car runs on reclaimed cooking oil.

98
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
我有一些相关文章  可以借你看
I have some literature, if you want it.

99
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,340
不用了  省纸吧
That's okay. Save the paper.

100
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,070
我从2004年起就没有印过任何东西
I haven't printed anything since 2004.

101
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,800
我打算发电邮给你
I was gonna e-mail you.

102
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
用你那高耗电的电脑吗
On your power-hungry computer?

103
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,530
我整座房子都是用太阳能供电的
My entire house is solar-powered.

104
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,760
我把电卖回给电网
I sell energy back to the grid

105
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,560
然后用那笔钱救北极熊
and use that money to save polar bears.

106
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,900
我是个环保律师
I'm an environmental lawyer,

107
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,650
所以我也是非常环保[绿色]的
so, you know, I'm pretty green.

108
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,870
你的草地也是嘛
So is your lawn.

109
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,650
我的庭院是抗干旱的
I went drought-tolerant --

110
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,820
多肉植物  本地植物  岩石庭院
Succulents, indigenous plants, rock garden.

111
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,510
我另一个爸爸说你的庭院像猫砂箱
My other daddy says your yard looks like a litter box.

112
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,920
她真是个可爱的孩子
She's a cute kid.

113
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,210
我还记得她穿一次性尿布时的样子
I remember when she was in disposable diapers.

114
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,290
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

115
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,220
好了
Yeah.

116
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,330
你穿这么漂亮干嘛  跟我不搭啊
Why do you look like that when I look like this?

117
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,880
我朋友说那是因为你有钱
My friends say it's because of your money.

118
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,240
不  我是说  不过是个学校开放日
No, I'm just saying why is she all dressed up

119
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,160
干嘛盛装打扮
for a school open house?

120
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,270
我想给曼尼的历史老师留下深刻印象
I want to impress Manny's history teacher.

121
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,630
我想让曼尼去华盛顿
I want Manny to go to Washington, D.C.

122
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,600
是的  参加青少年国会
Yeah, Junior Congress.

123
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,850
整个年级只有一个名额
Only one kid in the whole grade gets picked to go.

124
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,440
我觉得我能有所作为
I think I can make a difference.

125
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,380
得了吧  真的国会都只是个摆设而已
Regular Congress can't even make a difference.

126
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,780
别担心  曼尼  包在我身上
Don't worry, Manny. I have it covered.

127
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,110
你只管去好好约会吧
You just go and enjoy your date.

128
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,080
我确实有个约会  没什么大不了
I have a date. It's no big deal.

129
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,260
你不要大惊小怪
D-don't make a whole thing about it.

130
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,330
我的车钥匙哪儿去了
What did I do with my car keys?

131
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,440
我们还只是朋友而已
I mean, we're just friends now,

132
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,580
但我有很好的预感
but I have a good feeling.

133
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,940
好吧  我知道不应该言之过早
I know -- don't get ahead of myself.

134
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,250
每次一放下都找不着了
Every time I put them down.

135
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,310
她叫什么名字
What is her name?

136
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,800
要么是佐伊  要么就是派珀
Either Zoe or Piper.

137
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,180
你怎么连约会对象的名字都不知道呢
How can you be going on a date and you don't know her name?

138
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,420
这就是有意思的地方啊
This is where it gets interesting.

139
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,920
我深表怀疑
I seriously doubt that.

140
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,210
几天前我们差点因为一个女孩争风吃醋
A few days ago, we almost let a girl come between us.

141
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
-那是谁  -新来的姑娘
- Who is she? - The new girl.

142
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,690
-好漂亮  -美极了
- She's pretty. - Super-pretty.

143
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,550
我要了
Dibs.

144
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,400
什么  不  你不能这样
What?! N-no. You can't call dibs.

145
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
她是个有情感的大活人
She's a human being with feelings,

146
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,150
这不是在抢前排座位
not the front seat.

147
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,980
接着奇迹发生了
Then a miracle happened.

148
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,080
双胞胎  一样的美丽动人
Twins -- each as pretty as the other.

149
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,300
这很有趣  因为卢克和我一般
It's funny -- Luke and I don't usually

150
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,590
不会看上同一类型的女孩
go for the same kind of girl.

151
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,320
没错  我喜欢的类型是"容易上手型"
Yeah. I like to describe my type as "Gettable".

152
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,950
你在干什么  塔克
What are you doing, Tucker?

153
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,620
你好啊  布朗校长
Oh, hey, Principal Brown.

154
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,420
你知道其他的老师总是给家长
Do you know how other teachers drone on and on

155
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,160
讲那些枯燥无趣的老生常谈
to parents with their boring lectures?

156
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,460
我觉得我可以另辟蹊径
Well, I thought I would go another way.

157
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,390
听上去可不大妙
Oh. Well, I don't like the sound of that at all.

158
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,380
你一定会喜欢的
I think you will.

159
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,350
我打算来一堂躲避球课  活跃一下气氛
I'm gonna spice things up with a spirited game of dodgeball.

160
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,960
不要  千万不要  一百个不要
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

161
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,130
在你说"不要"之前
Okay, before you say "No"...

162
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,100
我已经说了"不要"了
I already said "No."

163
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,460
先看看我的全套构思
...let me show you my whole bit.

164
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,620
你们好  伙计们
Howdy, folks.

165
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,910
我名字叫塔克
My name's Tucker.

166
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,130
是"多比"镇警官  其实是"躲避"球
I'm the Sheriff of Dodge...ball.

167
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,620
家长们会哄堂大笑
"Laugh, laugh, laugh."

168
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,230
然后
And then --

169
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,080
不  没有然后  不行
No, no "then." No.

170
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,050
你看到那些家长的身材了吗
Have you seen the shape some of these folks are in?

171
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,730
我们可不想某个家长当场倒毙
We don't need a parent dropping dead in here.

172
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,400
这里是海豚湾体育馆
Look, this is the "Dolphin Den."

173
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,200
可没打算改名叫
I am not renaming it

174
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,570
曼德尔鲍姆纪念馆
the Harvey K. Mandelbaum memorial gym.

175
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,320
但我本来想把大家分成哈特菲尔德队
But I was gonna divide everybody up into

176
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,320
[电影《血仇》中的死对头]

177
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,460
和麦考伊队打比赛呢
the Hatfield and McCoys.

178
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,850
不许打躲避球
Just no dodgeball.

179
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,690
你好  英格拉姆老师
Hello, Mr. Ingram.

180
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,280
我是歌洛莉亚・德尔加多・迪尔加多  
I am Gloria Delgado-Pritchett,

181
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,250
曼尼的妈妈
Manny's mother.

182
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,480
没错  当然了
Yes, of course.

183
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
我想好好感谢您
I just wanted to thank you so much.

184
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,810
我儿子对您评价极高
He thinks the world of you.

185
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,290
作为移民的小孩
You know, as a child of an immigrant,

186
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,830
您让他对世界有别具一格的新鲜看法
he can look at the world with such a fresh perspective.

187
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,440
提到"新鲜"
And talking about fresh,

188
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,880
我给你带了些墨西哥酥皮饺子
I brought you some empanadas.

189
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,000
真有一套啊
Subtle.

190
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,650
菲尔  克莱尔呢
Hey, Phil. Where's Claire?

191
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,160
她去艾丽克斯的教室了
Oh, she's going to Alex's classes.

192
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,900
我负责卢克这一边
I'm doing Luke's.

193
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,900
你居然来了我很惊讶
I'm surprised to see you here.

194
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,990
你的球队不是今天比赛吗
Isn't your team playing today?

195
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,410
就是啊  但歌洛莉亚非要我来
Yeah. Gloria made me come.

196
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,780
我设好了录像机
I think I'm recording the game,

197
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,460
但谁知道会发生什么意外情况
but, you know, you can never know.

198
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,780
上次我录了六小时的Bravo电视台的节目
The last time, I got six hours of Bravo.

199
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,820
万事皆有可能
And who knows?

200
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,320
保不准曼尼就是第一个拉丁裔总统呢
Maybe Manny's going to be the first Latino President.

201
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,740
你好  英格拉姆老师
Hello, Mr. Ingram.

202
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,340
我是唐娜・邓肯医生
Dr. Donna Duncan,

203
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,730
韦斯利的妈妈
Wesley's mom.

204
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,470
一点小谢礼  不成敬意
Just brought you a little thank-you

205
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,420
因为您是我儿子最喜欢的老师
for being his absolute favorite teacher ever.

206
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,080
-这些蛋糕够白的  -谢谢夸奖
- Those cupcakes are so white. - Thank you.

207
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,500
我是唐娜・邓肯医生
Dr. Donna Duncan.

208
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,530
我是歌洛莉亚
I'm Gloria.

209
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,010
我们见过几次
We've met several times.

210
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,820
当然记得了
Oh, of course.

211
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,480
马里奥的妈妈  
Mario's mom.

212
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,610
是曼尼
Manny.

213
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,170
他适应得怎么样  比以前好些吗
And how is he fitting in now? Better?

214
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,180
总之
Anyway...

215
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,050
我带了好东西
Here she is.

216
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,340
你带了个酒壶来学校开放日吗
You brought a flask to an open house?

217
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,780
想来点吗  苏格兰威士忌  
You want some? It's Scotch.

218
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,710
不  拿远点
No. Put it away.

219
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,110
别这么娘娘腔
Don't be such a goody-goody.

220
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,580
尝一口  这酒比你年纪还大
Taste it. It's older than you are.

221
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,840
-我才不想喝威士忌  -那就闻一下
- I don't want any scotch. - Well, just smell it.

222
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,220
-好  -邓菲先生  你拿的是酒壶吗
- Fine. - Mr. Dunphy, is that a flask?

223
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,930
不是  是  实际上
No. It is. It I--

224
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,270
我只是  是他的
Uh, I was -- it's his.

225
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,050
才不是我的
No, it's not.

226
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,910
提醒一下  严禁带酒来学校
For the record, no alcohol is allowed on school premises.

227
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,370
你太不象话了  菲尔  
For god's sake, Phil,

228
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,150
这才下午两点而已
it's 2:00 in the afternoon.

229
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,180
艾丽克斯  跟我说说你为什么来这里
So, Alex, tell me why you're here.

230
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,590
我昨晚有点情绪失控
I had a little meltdown last night,

231
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,470
我害怕以后还会这样
and I'm afraid it'll happen again.

232
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,830
但下次没准会发生在大学入学考试过程中
But, this time, in the middle of the S.A.T or something.

233
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,650
那你为什么失控了呢
Why do you think you melted down?

234
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,060
我压力山大啊
I'm stressed.

235
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,450
我已经高三了
It's my junior year.

236
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,530
我觉得可能是
Part of me feels like

237
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,330
我的大脑边缘系统有点儿失灵
the limbic system in my brain's a bit off.

238
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,450
有这么一种病  对吧  我做过调研
That's a thing, right? I did some research.

239
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,840
你知道就算你自我诊断了
You know I charge the same

240
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,700
我也照旧收钱  对吧
even if you diagnose yourself?

241
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,710
我只想提高下效率
I'm just trying to move this along.

242
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,180
我还有很多事要做
I have a lot to do.

243
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,510
治疗是讲究过程的
Well, uh, this is a process.

244
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,100
需要花些时间
You know, it takes some time.

245
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,720
你在想什么
What -- what are you thinking?

246
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,820
-没什么  -没事  直说好了
- Nothing. - No, no. Go ahead. Tell me.

247
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,760
我觉得你可能帮不上我
That maybe you're not up for this.

248
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,970
无意冒犯
I mean, no offense.

249
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,420
只不过你看起来比网站上老很多
You're just a lot older than you look on your website.

250
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,640
你上学那个年代有大学入学考试
Did you even have S.A.T.s when you were in high school

251
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,000
或是亚裔学生吗
or Asian kids?

252
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,270
那倒没有
Oh, no. no, no, no.

253
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,590
但也有其他事情让我很担心
But there were other things I worried about --

254
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,830
比如西班牙宗教法庭
Spanish inquisition,

255
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,440
出海寻找世界尽头
sailing off the edge of the world,

256
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,640
还要学习火到底是什么东西
learning how to understand fire.

257
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,040
抱歉
Sorry.

258
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,120
-不如我们换一种方式  -什么
- You mind if we try something? - What?

259
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,600
就当帮我的忙了
Just do me a favor.

260
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,640
深吸一口气
Take a deep breath.

261
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,200
很好
Great.

262
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,670
此时此刻  你在想什么
Now... what's on your mind?

263
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,710
我才想起来在离家之前
Well... I just remembered that I forgot

264
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,540
我忘了给电脑充上电了
to charge my computer before I left

265
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,450
而且我该在周一前买新的索引卡
and that I have to get new index cards before Monday.

266
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,900
希望还有蓝色的
Hopefully they don't run out of the blue ones,

267
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,460
因为不知为何蓝色的能帮助我学习
because, for some reason, those help me study better.

268
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,060
也许是因为它们读起来容易些
Maybe it's because they're easier to read

269
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,350
也许是因为我的药方不管用了
or maybe my prescription's getting worse.

270
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,050
我或许该去找我的眼科医生检查一下
I should probably make an appointment with the eye doctor.

271
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,600
还有  我这个暑假是不是该找个工作
Also, should I get a job this summer

272
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,510
实习经验会不会有利于我的申请
or would an internship look better on my application?

273
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,160
再有  希拉里到底是怎么了
And what is up with Hillary?

274
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,650
她到底要不要竞选
Is she going to run or not?

275
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,260
我觉得她应该完全理解
I mean, I feel like she'd totally understand

276
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,700
被别人风头压在下面的感觉
the feeling of being overwhelmed,

277
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,450
但同时又觉得她没有尽最大努力
but also like you're not doing enough at the same time.

278
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,800
你好  妮娜  你家桑杰怎么样
Hey, Nina, how's Sanjay?

279
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,050
很好  谢谢关心
Oh, great. Thanks.

280
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,300
他在准备入学考试和大学测验
He's just dealing with the S.A.T.s and the A.C.T.s.

281
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,830
还有那个荣誉奖学金申请
And that merit scholarship application

282
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,970
每个人都在努力争取
everyone's so stressed about.

283
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,660
什么  什么申请
What -- what application?

284
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,120
我们从物理考试开始说起吧
Let's begin by talking about the A.P. Physics test,

285
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,190
你们都知道  这门考试安排在
which, as you know, takes place on...

286
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,800
5月21日
May 21st.

287
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,310
卢克和海莉自理能力差
With Luke and Haley,

288
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,500
所以我要为他们安排好所有事
I'm on top of everything because they aren't.

289
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,960
但是艾丽克斯是那么的自立
But Alex is so self-sufficient,

290
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,930
我就撒手让她自己干了[调到自动巡航模式]
I just sort of put it in cruise control.

291
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,450
我在方向盘那儿睡着了
I've fallen asleep at the wheel,

292
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,460
结果现在我的小天才往自己身上抹蛋糕
and now my little genius is covered in cake.

293
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,640
下面是我推荐学生
Now, a list of practice tests I recommend

294
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,280
在考试前做的习题
the students take before then

295
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,240
3a  4c  12a一直到f题
3a, 4c, 12a through "f,"

296
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,710
18d  19a  23c
18d, 19a, 23c,

297
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,060
24g  25h  26a
24g, 25h, 26a...

298
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,340
同时  像鲍勃・迪伦这样伟大的艺术家
Meanwhile, a great artist like Bob Dylan

299
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,710
会在第一轮就出局
would get voted off in the first round, which --

300
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,180
如果你把吸管的一端弄湿
If you wet the end,

301
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,640
就会粘在他脸上
it will stick to his face.

302
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
你真是个天才
You're a genius.

303
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,330
派珀  那样做太无礼了
Piper, that's rude.

304
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,740
曼尼  我们合唱队会唱
You know, Manny, in chorus,

305
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,310
《随风飘荡》这首歌
we sing "Blowin' in the wind."

306
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,810
这才叫做"随风飘荡"
Now that's blowin' in the wind.

307
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,760
你真风趣  卢克
You're funny, Luke.

308
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,570
曼尼和我要去趟洗手间
Manny and I need to use the restroom.

309
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,510
是吗
We do?

310
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,140
你得跟我换换对象
You've got to switch with me.

311
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,720
什么  不行  我们不能那样做
What? No, we can't do that.

312
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,650
她们是双胞胎  是不会发觉的
They're twins. They'll never notice.

313
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,860
你知道我们俩不是双胞胎吧
You realize we're not twins, right?

314
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,460
莉莉的娃娃屋特快专递来啦
Special dollhouse delivery for Lily!

315
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,750
来啦  来啦
It's here, it's here!

316
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,220
你绝对会爱上它的
I think you're going to love it.

317
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,450
我像你这么大的时候  整天都在玩这个
I spent so many hours playing with this when I was your age.

318
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,750
我也是
Yeah, me too.

319
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,950
快点把车熄火
Hey, quick, turn off your car.

320
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,440
怎么了  在停车模式上呢  我觉得
Why? It's in park, I think.

321
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,280
我有个邻居是环保人士
I have a judgey green neighbor.

322
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,990
他竟然有胆子跑过来
He had the nerve to come over here

323
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,300
跟我说我不够环保
and tell me that I'm not green enough.

324
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,100
不会吧  你超级环保的
Shut up! You're super-green.

325
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,600
谢了  我回收利用了个娃娃屋
Thank you. I'm -- I'm recycling a dollhouse.

326
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,270
我甚至还"回收利用"了个孩子
I even recycled a child.

327
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,120
-你不是还赢了个奖吗  -对的对的
- Didn't you win some award? - Yes, yes.

328
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,010
州律师协会奖  为了表彰在环境法方面
The state bar association award for sustained excellence

329
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,950
做出长期卓越的贡
in the field of environmental...

330
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,910
对对对  就是这个
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the one.

331
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,510
献  还有一个字没说完呢
...law. There was one word left.

332
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,590
你没有必要打断我
You didn't have to cut me off.

333
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,690
先把娃娃屋拿出来再说
Dollhouse, please.

334
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,300
好的  马上就好
Okay. Yeah, in a minute.

335
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,210
你知道该怎么做吗
You know what you should do?

336
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,350
去他家找他
March right over there

337
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,970
向他炫耀一下你的奖杯
and wave that trophy in his stupid eco face.

338
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,440
不是吧  你真这么想吗
No. You think?

339
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,450
没错  这些人烦死了
Yes. Those people are so annoying.

340
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,330
我们学校有个女生
There's this girl at my school

341
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,080
一直指责我说我的靴子是皮的
who was all over me about my boots 'cause they're leather.

342
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,720
可她自己还穿"鳄鱼牌"[洞洞鞋]
Meanwhile, she's wearing Crocs,

343
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,100
好像那就没有濒临灭绝一样
like those aren't endangered.

344
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,720
你知道么  我就要那么做
You know what? I am gonna do that.

345
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,830
让他知道我有多环保
Show him to out-green me.

346
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,860
-好吧  不  -不
- Okay. Oh, no. - Oh, no.

347
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,320
都吹到他的院子里了
All right, those are blowing into his yard.

348
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,930
这  这绝对对我不利
That is -- okay, that's definitely gonna hurt my case.

349
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,600
你把这些捡起来
Uh, you pick these up.

350
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,470
我去拿奖杯  莉莉  你帮她捡
I'm gonna go get the trophy. Lily, help her.

351
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,770
我听到你说"回收小孩"的话了
I heard that "recycled child" comment.

352
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,090
多谢你的酒瓶
Thanks to your little flask,

353
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,660
现在老师认为我是个酒鬼
now the teacher thinks I'm a burnout.

354
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,090
橄榄球赛
Football game.

355
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,840
橄榄球赛
Football game!

356
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,440
-你在干吗  -现在可以语音搜索了
- What are you doing? - You can do this now.

357
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,530
我在广告上看到的
I saw it in a commercial.

358
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,160
那款手机做不到
Not with that phone.

359
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,950
跟对着钱包说效果一样
You might as well say it into your wallet.

360
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,920
快点  我们要赶不上数学课了
Come on. We're gonna be late for math.

361
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,100
我不会再去那些无聊的课了
I'm not going to any more boring classes.

362
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,770
你要半途而废吗
You're just gonna cut?

363
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,670
不  不去上课是因为我已经六十多了
No,I'm just not gonna go because I'm in my 60s.

364
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,340
教师休息室
Teacher's lounge.

365
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,740
这里有台电视机
They got a TV in here.

366
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,510
-我们不能去教师休息室  -为什么不
- We can't go in the teacher's lounge. - Why not?

367
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,950
-因为那是老师专用的  -你就是老师
- Um, it's for teachers only. - You're a teacher.

368
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,320
你现在就在教我怎么做个小怨妇
Right now, you're teaching me how to be a little bitch.

369
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,960
杰  不要  杰
Jay, don't. Jay.

370
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,060
杰
Jay!

371
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,280
您大概什么时候做决定呢
So, when do you think you'll be making your decision?

372
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,370
下周左右吧
Oh, sometime in the next week or so.

373
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,300
慢慢来  逼您做决定是不礼貌的
Oh, take your time. It would be rude to rush you.

374
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,040
在别人谈话的时候插嘴
Not as rude as interrupting two people

375
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,240
更没礼貌
in the middle of a conversation.

376
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,950
实际上我得走了
Well, actually, I'll go.

377
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,630
我要喝点咖啡
I'm gonna go grab some coffee.

378
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,010
就是  那些蛋糕看起来就很干
Good idea because those cupcakes look very dry.

379
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,950
这简直让人难以置信
Okay. This is unbelievable.

380
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,130
他们刚给了我四本关于申请名校的书
They just gave me four books on applying to top colleges.

381
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,310
我哪来的时间读完这些
When am I gonna have time to read all this?

382
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,120
天啊  真对不起
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

383
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,210
我没看到你  快来吧  各位
I didn't see you there. Come on, girls.

384
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,090
她超过分的
Oh, she's so mean.

385
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,170
-怎么可能有人注意不到我  -她是谁
- Everybody sees me. - Who was that?

386
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,610
多达・达达医生
Dr. Dooda Dada.

387
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,390
她以为可以靠色诱老师帮她儿子去华盛顿
She thinks that she can flirt her son all the way to Washington,

388
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,980
我不会让她得逞的
but I'm gonna take her down.

389
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,580
我很想跟你聊  可我得去微积分课
I would love to chat, but I got to get to A.P. Calc.

390
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,250
体育课是学校生活的重要部分
Physical education is a critical part of every school day.

391
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,270
我们学习知识的同时  也应该锻炼身体
As we develop the mind, so we must the body.

392
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,550
首先需要保证营养  勤做运动
This begins with good nutrition, uh, physical activity,

393
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,280
培养体育精神以及注重个人卫生
sportsmanship, and attention to personal hygiene.

394
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,520
不  拜托你们不要走
No, please, please, please don't go.

395
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,690
我知道这很无聊  可这不是我安排的
I know this is boring, but this isn't my idea.

396
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,260
我本来想组织一场躲避球大赛  可是
I wanted to play a spirited game of dodgeball, but --

397
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,750
听起来很有趣  我要玩躲避球
That sounds fun. I'll play dodgeball.

398
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,950
我也要玩
I'll play, too.

399
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,480
任何东西都比讲这些有意思
Anything's got to be better than this.

400
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,460
知道吗
Oh, well, you know what?

401
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,180
我们真的不应该那么做  可是知道吗
We're really not supposed to, but you know what?

402
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,410
各位  听着  我叫小卡
Hey, guys, listen to this. My name's Cam.

403
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,960
是"多比"镇警官  其实是"躲避"球
I'm the sheriff of Dodge...ball.

404
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,310
你们是哈特菲尔德队
Okay, you guys are the Hatfields.

405
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,790
你们是麦考伊队
You are the McCoys.

406
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,440
曼德尔鲍姆先生  请您继续坐着
Mr. Mandelbaum, I'd like you to stay seated.

407
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,940
您来做我们的裁判就好
You're gonna be our referee.

408
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,200
好了  各位  躲避球大赛开始
All right, everybody, let's dodgeball!

409
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,150
躲避球比赛精彩极了
Dodgeball was a smash.

410
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,500
唐娜医生和歌洛莉亚像两个刺客
Dr. Donna and Gloria were like two assassins

411
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,540
把他们的目标一个一个干掉
just picking off their victims one by one.

412
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,470
终极躲避球对决
Okay, last two dodgeballers.

413
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,710
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

414
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,870
准备好了
Yes.

415
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,480
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

416
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,800
准备好了
Yes!

417
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,500
不好意思
Oh, I'm so sorry.

418
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,050
我要杀了你
I'm going to kill you!

419
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,850
歌洛莉亚  歌洛莉亚不要激动
Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, don't!

420
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,610
我的眼睛  你们怎么能这样
Ow! My eye! I don't understand you!

421
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,660
你喜欢戏剧
So, you like theater,

422
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,030
而你刚在薯条里放了根假拇指
and you just put this fake thumb in our fries.

423
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,010
没错
Yep.

424
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,150
这么说也许有点冒险
I'm gonna go out on a limb here

425
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,600
可是我们也许约错人了
and say we're with the wrong people.

426
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,230
我们互换对象就解决问题了
Let's just switch dates and get this party started.

427
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,040
什么  我们不想换
What? We don't want to switch.

428
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,280
我对你没兴趣
Yeah. I'm not attracted to you.

429
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,160
我也对你没兴趣
And I'm not attracted to you.

430
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,050
等等
Wait a minute.

431
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,500
我们爱好相同但你却不喜欢我吗
We like all the same things, but you don't think I'm cute?

432
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,380
我对拉丁裔男生有好感
I've got a thing for Latin men.

433
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,840
我喜欢呆一点的
I like 'em dumb.

434
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,490
-这很伤人  -而且肤浅
- Ugh. Well, that's just offensive. - And shallow.

435
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,820
我们是男生不代表我们不会受伤
Just because we're guys doesn't mean we don't have feelings.

436
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,920
我觉得这不太好
Yeah. I don't feel good about this.

437
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,250
让我觉得
It makes me feel...

438
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,460
很糟
bad.

439
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,190
算了  卢克  我们走吧
Come on, Luke. Let's get out of here.

440
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,300
我们的父母不在家
Our parents aren't home.

441
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,430
如果你们愿意  我们可以和你们亲热下
If you want, we'll make out with you.

442
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,570
接下来发生的事我并不引以为豪
I'm not proud of what happened next.

443
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,500
我觉得很好
I am.

444
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,520
他不在家
He's not home.

445
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,480
你打扫得怎样了
How's the cleanup going?

446
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,570
我觉得大部分搞定了
Well, I think I got most of them.

447
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,340
你搞了这么久
You've been at this a while.

448
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,000
怎么只捡了八个塑料球呢
How come you only have like eight peanuts?

449
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,470
我只是没有把它们抱着到处走
Instead of carrying them around,

450
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,930
我把它们都堆在那里
I made a huge pile right over th--

451
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,140
-又来  -天哪  到处都是
- Again?! - Geez. They're everywhere.

452
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,050
天哪  不  有只鸟
Oh, god. No! Bird!

453
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,340
不要啊
Aah! Oh, no!

454
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,450
不  不  不  不
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!

455
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,190
不  这是什么味道
Oh, no! What is that smell?!

456
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,290
闻起来像炸薯条
It smells like french fries!

457
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,650
这是生物柴油  你能把它塞起来吗
It's biodiesel. Can you plug it up?

458
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,540
-用什么塞  爆米花吗  -天哪
- Oh, what? With what? Popcorn? - Oh, geez. Oh, god.

459
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,710
不  我的靴子  真是场灾难
No! My boots! This is a disaster!

460
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,800
保护海豹
Save the seals!

461
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,310
什么  什么情况
What -- what -- what -- what the hell?

462
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,020
你们做了什么
What did you do?

463
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,930
我赢过一座环保奖杯
Uh, I won a green award.

464
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,460
就是这样
That's what.

465
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,590
你确定你能修好这东西吗
You think you can get this thing to work?

466
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,730
你应该去放哨的
Hey, you're supposed to be the lookout.

467
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,690
有人进来了怎么办
What if somebody walks in?

468
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,420
他们会打给我父母
Gee, they'll call my parents.

469
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,420
看  你成功了
Hey! Look! You did it!

470
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,780
是啊  不是很复杂
Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.

471
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,960
听着  我要回课堂了
Listen, I'm gonna get back to class.

472
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,930
你走之前  我有个问题想问你
Before you go, let me ask you a question.

473
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,220
你怎么会这么擅长修理东西呢
How do you know how to do all this stuff?

474
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,140
高中时  我是影音俱乐部的
Back in high school, I was in the A.V. Club.

475
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,820
我们做过很多疯狂的事情
We did all kinds of crazy things.

476
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,770
有一年  我们在体育馆藏了一台麦克风
One year, we hid a microphone in the gym.

477
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,440
毕业舞会发生的事情我们都能听到
We could totally hear everything that was going on at prom.

478
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,330
我曾经取笑过你们这种人
I used to make fun of guys like you.

479
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,470
但这很酷
This is pretty cool.

480
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
真的吗
Really?

481
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,190
你觉得这就算酷了
You think this is cool...

482
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,300
第一次进攻  好样的
First down! All right.

483
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,450
史上最棒的学校开放日
Best open house ever.

484
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,360
在影音俱乐部里一切都轻而易举
It's all gravy when you're in the A.V.

485
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,500
承认吧  打破些规则
Admit it -- doesn't it feel good

486
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,580
游走在制度边缘
to break a few rules,

487
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,320
是不是感觉挺好
take a walk on the wild side?

488
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,660
-不用谢  -不  是你不用谢
- You're welcome. - No, you're welcome.

489
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,120
这些都是我搞的
I'm the one who set this whole thing up.

490
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,070
不如说我们配合得不错吧
Let's just say we make a good team.

491
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,360
敬我们
To us.

492
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,160
他进攻了  进攻了
There he goes. There he goes.

493
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,310
上啊  上啊  上啊
Come on, come on! Come on!

494
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,110
上啊  漂亮
Come on! Yeah!

495
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,600
从我记事起我就是这个样子了
I've been like this for as long as I can remember.

496
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,470
能给我举个例子吗
Can you give me an example?

497
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,400
在我很小的时候
Well, when I was little,

498
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,970
是拼写队的成员
I was in a spelling team at school

499
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:15,880
我真的很想赢
and I really wanted to win.

500
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,210
我也不知道为什么  也没有奖励
I don't know why. There was no prize.

501
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,520
没人在乎
No one cared.

502
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,750
我父母甚至都不知道我参加了
My parents didn't even know I was in it.

503
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,500
我只是觉得肩上有这样的责任
I just felt this weight on my shoulders,

504
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,510
就好像如果输了  我会  我也不知道
like if I lost, I'd...I don't know.

505
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,480
-我就是必须要赢  -那你赢了吗
- I just had to win. - And did you?

506
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,850
是的  你知道决胜的词是什么吗
Yep. Know what the winning word was?

507
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,700
责任
Responsibility.

508
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,430
你是那么想的吗
Is that what you feel?

509
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,790
一直有着需要赢的责任
A responsibility to win all the time?

510
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,600
永远要做最好的
To always be the best?

511
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,320
你可以这么说
That's one way to put it.

512
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,520
这种责任  从哪里来
And this responsibility -- where does it come from?

513
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,940
我也不知道  它就自然存在了
I'm not sure. It's just...there.

514
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,450
所以这是种内部压力
So it's an internal pressure.

515
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,490
算是吧
Kind of.

516
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,870
一旦你做得超过预期了
I mean, once you start overachieving,

517
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,570
人们就开始对你有所期待
people expect things from you.

518
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,800
人们是谁
Like what people?

519
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,990
就是  全世界
You know, the world...

520
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,000
老师  家长  其他孩子
Teachers, parents, other kids.

521
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,030
也不完全是内部的
It's not all internal.

522
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,700
别误会
Don't get me wrong.

523
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,390
我喜欢这种紧张的状态
I like the way I'm wired.

524
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,260
只有这样我才能上好学校
It's what's going to get me into a good school.

525
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,110
这才是我
It's what makes me who I am.

526
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:20,760
那感觉怎么样  做你自己
And how is that -- being who you are?

527
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,940
我不知道
I don't know.

528
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,270
大多数时候还不错
Mostly good.

529
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,230
有点累
A little exhausting.

530
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,700
有时候很艰难
Sometimes hard.

531
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,910
我觉得这就是你想要的答案吧
I guess there's your answer.

532
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,550
做我自己很难
It's hard being me.

533
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,700
再跟我说说你的家庭
Tell me a little more about your family.

534
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,770
就是个很普通的家庭
They're pretty normal, I guess.

535
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,330
我跟他们都不太一样
I'm not like any of them,

536
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,240
-但这对我没什么困扰  -从来没有吗
- But that doesn't really bother me. - Ever?

537
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,490
除非他们说"艾丽克斯  你太刻苦了"
Only when they say things like "Alex, you study too much"

538
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,840
或是"别紧张"  "去玩玩"之类的
or "Don't freak out" or "Go do something fun."

539
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,820
就是说你的兄弟姐妹
So, your siblings--

540
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,030
他们并没有你那样的压力
they don't experience the same pressures you do.

541
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,770
天呐  当然没有  他们才不在乎学业
Oh, god, no. They don't care about school.

542
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,170
你觉得原因是什么呢
Hmm. Why do you think that is?

543
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:59,810
你们都在同一屋檐下长大
I mean, you all grew up in the same house

544
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,470
有着同样的父母  而你却是唯一
with the same parents, yet you're the only one

545
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,450
为了达到高标准
who feels this enormous pressure

546
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,320
而感到巨大压力的人
to achieve at such a high level.

547
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,880
为什么要谈论我的家人
Why do we even have to talk about my family?

548
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,990
他们跟这事没关系
They don't have anything to do with this.

549
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,100
他们不懂我
They don't get me.

550
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,710
这种感觉如何
How's that feel?

551
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,070
-不知道  -你很聪明
- I don't know. - You're a smart girl.

552
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,610
-再好好想想  -我说了不知道
- Try a little harder. - I said I don't know.

553
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,110
我感觉
I feel...

554
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,560
有点孤单
kind of alone.

555
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,320
我知道孩子们都忙着准备入学考试
I realize our juniors are busy with SATs, so as a rule,

556
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,580
所以我每晚只布置两个小时的作业量
I only give two hours of homework a night.

557
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,030
-两个小时啊  -我们的学生非常棒
- Two hours? - Our students are highly advanced.

558
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,280
他们完全应付得来
It's nothing they can't handle.

559
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,970
我相信他们可以
You know, I'm-- I'm sure they can.

560
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,710
只是说他们要上两小时的课
It's just that if they have two hours in this class

561
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,720
还要上一小时的生物课
and they have an hour for A.P. Bio

562
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
还有一个半小时的文学课
and an hour and a half for, um, advanced lit

563
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,010
再加上  稍等
and-- hang on one second.

564
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,540
我要写在板子上
Let me just do this on the board,

565
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:57,090
两小时一小时再加一个半小时
'cause then it's-- um, we got 2 and 1 and 1.5

566
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,930
之后还有一个半小时
and then another, uh, hour and a half

567
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,920
历史课  算下来
for A.P. History-- gives us...

568
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,240
-六小时  -没错
- It's 6. - Yes!

569
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,410
妮娜  我就要算出来了
Nina, I was getting there.

570
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,640
谢谢  非常感谢
Thank you! Thank you so much!

571
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,920
要是你打字没那么大声
If I could just have a second to think

572
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
我就能静下心来计算了
without all the tippy-tappy typing.

573
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,160
六小时
6.

574
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,700
这下你们高兴了吧
Well, I hope you're happy.

575
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,410
你们毁了大家的躲避球赛
You've ruined dodgeball for everyone.

576
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,300
是她把球扔到我脸上的
She was the one who threw that ball in my face.

577
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,540
那是因为你色诱英格拉姆老师
Only because you threw yourself at Mr. Ingram.

578
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,590
拜托  女士们
Okay, ladies, please.

579
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,660
你们看不出你们在干什么吗
Can't you see what's going on here?

580
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,700
你们都只是想为孩子争取最好的机会
You both just want what's best for your kids.

581
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,530
我得帮韦斯利争取到这次旅行
I need to get this trip for Wesley.

582
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,290
我不想再看到他每次都对我生气
I'm tired of him being so mad at me all the time.

583
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,270
他为什么生气
Why is he mad?

584
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,100
他认为我和他爸离婚是我的错
Oh, he blames me for the divorce.

585
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,990
他爸爸总是那个好人
His father will always be the hero.

586
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,190
不在身边的人总是不会被责怪
It's hard to blame someone who's never there.

587
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,950
难道你不能理解吗
Now, can't you relate to that?

588
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,270
会好起来的
It will get better.

589
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,610
孩子们会明白谁是真正为他们好的
Kids always figure out who's really there for them.

590
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,150
对投影仪的事再次表示抱歉
Again, we're very sorry about the projector.

591
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,940
我周一会寄来支票
I'll send a check on Monday.

592
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,160
-亲爱的  -我惹事了
- Hi, honey. - I got in trouble.

593
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,350
她的事都记到我的帐上
Whatever she did, add it to my tab.

594
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,790
-好吧  来吧  -不不
- All right, let's do this. - No. No, no, no.

595
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,650
不是你俩  就你  来吧  警长
Not you two, just you. Come on, sheriff.

596
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,220
亲爱的  怎么样
Oh, hey, honey. How did it go?

597
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,140
挺好的  下周继续
Good. And I made another session for next week.

598
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,020
学校开放日怎么样
How was the open house?

599
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,630
非常紧张
Wow. So intense.

600
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,530
我都不知道你承受了那么大的压力
I had no idea the kind of pressure you're under.

601
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,600
亲爱的  我只在学校体验了两个小时
Honey, I was just you for two hours.

602
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,820
就已经快受不了了
I could barely hold it together.

603
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,760
你没有每天情绪失控真是太了不起了
I don't know how you don't have a meltdown every day.

604
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,000
-我  -亲爱的
- I... - Oh, honey.

605
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,560
宝贝  怎么了  是我说了什么吗
Sweetie, what? Did I say something?

606
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,520
是的
Yes.

607
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,830
谢谢
Thank you.

608
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,420
没事
Okay.

609
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,960
没事
Okay.

610
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,210
乖
Okay.

611
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,290
再次抱歉
Again, I am so sorry.

612
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,040
现在想来  我过来向你炫耀
I-I guess, in retrospect, it was a little crazy

613
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,350
我的州律师协会奖  实在有点疯狂
that I wanted to show you my state bar association award.

614
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,260
别说了
Stop.

615
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,370
可能是我太过激了
And it's possible I come on a little too strong.

616
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,810
不不不
No. No, no.

617
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,480
我以为我很环保
I like to think that I'm greener than I am,

618
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,170
但也许我只是想
but maybe I just want the credit

619
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,850
不像你那样卖力气就得到赞赏
without doing all the hard work that you do.

620
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,230
你说得对  是很不容易
Well, you're right-- it is hard,

621
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,960
但也会遭到孤立
but, you know, it's also alienating.

622
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,610
没人想跟我交朋友
You know, no one wants to be friends with me.

623
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,120
我都不记得上次请别人
I-I can't tell you the last time

624
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,550
来家里吃饭是什么时候了
I had people over for dinner,

625
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,750
也许这是好事
which is probably a good thing.

626
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,690
你知道太阳能嘛
You know, with solar power,

627
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,520
需要四天的时间才能烤熟一只鸡
it takes four days to roast a chicken.

628
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,010
-真的吗  -如果你想全熟的话
- Really? - If you want it cooked all the way through, yeah.

629
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,890
知道我得过三次沙门氏菌病吗
You know I had salmonella three times?

630
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,830
你可以来我家吃饭
If you want to come over to our house for dinner,

631
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,830
-我们欠你的  -你可以玩我的娃娃屋
- we kind of owe you. - You can play with my dollhouse.

632
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,840
真的吗
Yeah?

633
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,960
那是可持续材料做的吗
Does it made from sustainable materials?

634
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,240
当我没说
Forget it.
