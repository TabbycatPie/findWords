戈登没有照吩咐杀了企鹅

不妨跟你说实话好了

是这样  你男朋友本该为某人杀一个人

61
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,890
所以那个某人很生气

他没杀科波特

吉姆・戈登真是个幸运的小子

110磅

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,530
我打赌你这一头金发也是纯天然的
I bet that's your real hair color, too.

72
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,790
你们要对他...做什么
What are you gonna... do to Jim?

73
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,580
你跟罪犯交往过吗
You ever been with a criminal?

有些人觉得罪犯很性感
Some ladies find it a turn-on.

75
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,160
吉姆
Jim.

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,150
正说你呢
Speak of the devil.

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,230
我刚在跟你可爱的小女友增进了解呢
I was just getting to know your lovely lady.

78
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,880
你们这是非法闯入  滚出我家
You're trespassing. Get out.

79
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,600
别急啊  伙计
Slow down, hoss.

80
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,830
你搞错形势了  这里我说了算
You're misreading the situation. I'm the shot caller here.

81
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,870
现在的形势是  你老板要求你把我活着带回去
The situation is you've been told to bring me in alive,

82
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,270
否则我现在已经死了
or I'd be dead already.

83
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,210
但我很乐意这就把你们击毙
But I'm happy to kill you right here and now.

84
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,550
别这么横
Don't be such a hard-ass.

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,370
别这样  规矩你懂的
Come on, you know the rules.

86
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,530
只要你配合  乖乖受罚
You play nice, you take your lumps...

87
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,310
别人就不会受伤
nobody else gets hurt.

88
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,690
叫你伙计把枪放下  不然我一枪爆头
Tell your friend to drop his gun or I'll blow his brains out.

89
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,990
-老天  吉姆  -没事  我能处理

但现在  等我们杀了你  金发妞就是下一个
But now, after we kill you, we're gonna kill blondie, too.

94
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,630
而且要慢慢来

我们得走了

戈登来了

121
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,880
他疯了吗
Is he nuts?

122
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,560
他来干什么
What's he doing here?

123
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,610
难以置信
You believe this guy?

124
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,590
阿尔瓦雷斯
Hey, Alvarez.

125
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,710
你还有法官签的空头逮捕令吗
You got any of those blank warrants that Judge Bam Bam signed?

126
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,090
有啊
Uh... yeah.

127
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,130
这不可容忍
This cannot stand.

128
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,270
戈登必须死  布洛克必须死
Gordon must die, Bullock must die,

129
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,060
企鹅也必须死  就今天
Penguin must die today!

130
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,020
那马罗尼也得死咯
And Maroni, too, I suppose?

131
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,570
有必要的话
If need be.

132
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,610
你小题大做了  亲爱的
You're overreacting, my dear.

133
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,130
这个企鹅无足轻重
This Penguin's a nobody.

134
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,680
而你想为个给你打伞的家伙挑起战争
You want to start a war over the guy that carried your umbrella?

135
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,180
他就是我的跟屁虫
He was on my hip everywhere with me.

136
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,840
他知道些事情
He knows things.

137
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,890
什么事
Like what?

138
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,470
太多了
Too much.

139
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,640
他知道得太多了
He knows too much!

140
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,270
去找马罗尼
Go to Maroni

141
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,200
和气地问他愿不愿意把你的小跟班交出来
and ask him politely to hand over your little man.

142
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,390
和气点
Politely.

143
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,210
他要是不肯  我们就可以来硬的了
If he refuses, we can talk about stronger measures.

144
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,180
老大  这是示弱
Boss, this is weak response.

145
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,050
我真不想赞同菲什  但我们显示强硬态度
I hate to agree with Fish, but we need to show strength now.

146
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,010
我们得猛力回击  没得商量
We need to hit back hard. No talk.

147
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,430
干掉企鹅人  干掉戈登  结束
Penguin dead, Gordon dead, done.

148
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,300
镇定  尼克  我心里有数
Relax, Niko. I know what I'm doing.

149
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,630
戈登呢
Where is Gordon?

150
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,930
你不是说要带他一起来吗
I thought you were bringing him with you.

151
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,180
没有  他不肯乖乖就范
No. He wouldn't come without a struggle.

152
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,590
我不知道他逞强  还是根本就是疯了
Now, I don't know if he's playing tough or crazy,

153
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,370
但他居然跟没事人似的去上班了
but he's at work like nothing's wrong.

154
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,350
我会派维克多去找他
I'll send Victor to fetch him.

155
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,960
不需要  我的人能处理
No need. My guys can handle him.

156
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,070
我会派维克多去
I'll send Victor.

157
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,810
这真是只漂亮的鸡  不是吗
That's a nice handsome bird, huh?

158
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,380
我不了解鸡
I don't know chickens.

159
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,550
离远点
Fall back.

160
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,180
老家伙就在那边呢
The old man is right there.

161
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,740
去他的吧  他玩儿完了
Screw him. He's done.

162
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,260
我们该动手了
Now's the time to strike.

163
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,170
-还不到时候  -总是还不到时候
- Not yet. - Not yet, not yet.

164
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,940
现在不动手还要等什么时候  看看他
If not now, when? Look at him.

165
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,020
马罗尼家族都在笑话我们了  他却在玩儿鸡
Maroni clan are laughing at us, and he plays with chickens.

166
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,070
这正是我的忧虑之处
That's what has me worried.

167
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,480
他在玩儿鸡  他很高兴  放松
The chickens. He's happy, relaxed,

168
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,280
好像这世上没什么事让他操心
as if he doesn't have a care in the world.

169
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,730
-说明你那女孩活儿干得不错  -不
- That girl of yours is doing her job then. - No.

170
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,880
她说他都没碰过她一下
She says he hasn't even touched her.

171
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,910
她只是为他做饭  打扫卫生
She cooks and she cleans for him.

172
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,790
他喜欢看她做家务
He likes to watch her do chores.

173
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,810
好奇怪
Weird.

174
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,520
-但如果他就喜欢这个  -不对
- But if that's his thing... - No.

175
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,750
看他样子好像是知道了什么重要的事
He's acting as if he knows something important

176
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,570
别人却还蒙在鼓里
that no one else knows.

177
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,700
你来这儿干什么
What the hell are you doing here?

178
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,540
我在这儿工作  今天我当班
I work here. It's my shift.

179
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,320
不然我该去哪
Where else should I be?

180
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,750
阿拉斯加怎么样
How about Alaska?

181
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,590
逮捕令
Arrest warrants?

182
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,430
你要逮捕谁
For who?

183
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,850
奥布雷・詹姆斯市长  卡麦・法尔科内
Mayor Aubrey James, Carmine Falcone

184
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,320
还有他们的党羽
and their close associates.

185
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,660
罪名是在韦恩凶杀案中  共谋
On charges of conspiracy and perversion of justice

186
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,820
并妨碍司法公正
in the Wayne murder case.

187
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,540
你疯了吗
Are you insane?

188
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,380
没有
No.

189
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,720
也许有一点
Maybe a little.

190
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,070
但我感觉不错
Feels good.

191
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,450
反正他们也打算杀我
They're gonna try and kill me anyway.

192
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,890
我不如让他们也付出点代价
Might as well make them pay a price for it.

193
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,250
你要逮捕市长和法尔科内阁下  怎么做
You're gonna arrest the mayor and Don Falcone. How?

194
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,830
逮捕令上附着我的证词
My testimony is attached to the warrants.

195
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,140
光这一样就足以起诉他们一打罪名
That alone is enough to indict them on a dozen counts.

196
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,640
没错  如果你真能抓到人的话  但那不可能
Sure, if you could execute the warrants, which you can't.

197
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,130
如果地检官愿意起诉的话  但他不会愿意
If the D.A. Would prosecute, which he won't.

198
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,190
哥谭市不会有一个警察或者律师敢站出来帮你
There's not a single cop or lawyer in the city who will help you.

199
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,180
我认为只要反抗有成功的可能
I think there are plenty of people willing to help me

200
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,810
就会有很多人愿意帮我
once they see it's possible to fight back.

201
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,080
你这是在做白日梦  没人会帮你的
You're dreaming. Nobody will help you.

202
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,610
我是不会帮你的
I won't help you.

203
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,120
你以为我就不希望世道能有所改变吗
You don't think I want change just like you do?

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,670
我可是有家室的
I have a family.

205
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,120
我理解
I understand.

206
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,860
戈登...
Gordon...

207
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,930
离开这里吧
get out of town.

208
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,700
这是我的家
This is my home.

209
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,040
是我父亲的家
It was my father's home.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,170
我是不会离开的
I'm not leaving.

211
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,170
大家好啊
Hello, everyone.

212
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,570
我叫维克多・萨斯
My name is Victor Zsasz.

213
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,440
我是由卡麦・法尔科内阁下亲自派来
I'm sent here personally by Don Carmine Falcone himself

214
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,490
处理一件他很在意的事  所以请放尊敬点
on a matter of deep concern to him, so please be respectful.

215
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,900
我来这里
I'm here

216
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,640
是为了找吉姆・戈登
for Jim Gordon.

217
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,140
只找他
Only him.

218
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,790
其他所有人  管好分内的事  我们就相安无事
Everybody else, mind your business and we're cool.

219
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,560
吉姆在哪里
So where's Jim at?

220
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,760
谢谢你们
Thank you.

221
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,110
吉姆
Hey, Jim!

222
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,240
吉姆
Jim.

223
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,940
你好啊  吉姆
Hi, Jim.

224
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,990
放松
Relax.

225
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,130
我是来活捉你的
I'm supposed to take you in alive.

226
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,250
法尔科内阁下想和你谈谈
Don Falcone wants to talk.

227
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,610
告诉法尔科内我们会谈的
Tell Falcone we'll talk.

228
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,390
但不是今天
But not today.

229
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:33,570
别那样好吗
Don't be that way.

230
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,050
"活捉"的范围可广了
"Alive" is a very broad category.

231
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,740
一个人断了手  也是能活的
A man with no hands can still be alive.

232
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,260
这里有50个警察
There are 50 cops in here.

233
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,600
你试试啊
Try something.

234
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,080
所有人都出去
Everybody out.

235
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,840
拜托了
Please?!

236
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,070
走吧  头儿
Go, boss.

237
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,000
离开这里
Get out of here.

238
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,640

00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,950

现在怎么办  吉姆
Well, how now, Jim?

241
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,480
吉姆
Jim?

242
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,250
吉姆
Jim?

243
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,390
你为什么要躲着我呢  吉姆
Why are you hiding from me, Jim?

244
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,440
怎么回...
What the...?

245
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,970
那里
There!

246
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,540
要搭个便车吗
You need a ride?

247
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,060
快走  快快快
Go, go, go, go, go!

248
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,970
不要
No.

249
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,360
不要  求你了
No, please.

250
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,180
28个
Twenty-eight.

251
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,250
你醒了
You're back.

252
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,400
感觉如何
How do you feel?

253
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,660
糟透了
Terrible.

254
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,510
我在哪里  你是谁
Where am I? Who are you?

255
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,290
我是蒙托亚和艾伦的朋友
I'm a friend of Montoya and Allen.

256
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,560
我刚从你体内取出两颗子弹  并缝合了伤口
I just took two bullets out of you and sewed you up.

257
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,220
现在来看看你情况如何
Now I'm checking to see how you're doing.

258
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,240
那么
So...

259
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,870
你是谁  这是哪座城市
who are you, what city are we in,

260
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,460
今天是周几
and what day of the week is it?

261
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,190
我是詹姆斯・戈登
I'm James Gordon.

262
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,290
这里是哥谭
We're in Gotham.

263
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,380
今天是周五  怎么会有老鼠
It's Friday. Why are there rats?

264
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,540
这是大学的解剖实验室
It's the dissection lab at the university.

265
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,410
我听说你在躲避黑帮
I gather you're a fugitive from the mob.

266
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,780
不能去医院  克里斯帕斯说的
Can't go to the hospital, said Crispus.

267
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,560
还挺刺激的
Very exciting, I must say.

268
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,870
我昏迷了多久
How long have I been out?

269
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,210
大概几个小时  你很幸运
Just a couple of hours or so. You're very lucky.

270
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,590
重要器官都没...
No vital organs were...

271
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,140
别动  躺回去
Whoa, whoa, lie back down.

272
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,930
好吧  你受伤了
Okay? You are hurt.

273
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,080
得在床上躺一周...
Just a week or so in bed...

274
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,940
不行  我得走了
No, I have to go.

275
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,550
詹姆斯  你失血过多
James, you have lost a lot of blood.

276
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,710
你必须照我说的做  躺回去
You have to do as I say and lie back down.

277
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,970
不然你会死的
If you don't, you could die.

278
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,800
我得站起来  你能帮个忙吗
I have to stand. Can you help me?

279
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,970
好  好吧
Okay, okay.

280
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,190
克里斯帕斯
Crispus?

281
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,970
他说他要走了
He said he's leaving already.

282
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,880
-我必须马上走  -当然
- I have to go. Now. - Sure.

283
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,850
不过先穿上点衣服吧
Some clothes would be good though.

284
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,140
这关乎传统  价值观
This is about tradition, values.

285
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,210
告密者得受到惩罚  这是规矩
Snitches get stitches-- that's how it's always been.

286
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,200
你得把他交出来  萨尔
You need to hand him over, Sal.

287
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,960
我知道
I know.

288
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,940
这也应该
I should.

289
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,910
但没办法
But what can I say?

290
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,160
那小家伙会逗我开心
The little guy amuses me.

291
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,190
法尔科内阁下会很不高兴的
Don Falcone is going to be very unhappy.

292
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,660
你想为这个小瘪三而挑起战争吗
You want to start a war over this punk?

293
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,520
战争
War?

294
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,690
他对你们来说有那么重要吗
He's that important to you, is he?

295
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,330
不  他对我们而言什么都不是
No. He means nothing to us.

296
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,910
重要的是尊重
Respect is what matters here.

297
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,430
尊重  这我理解
Respect I understand.

298
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,070
企鹅
Penguin!

299
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,160
出来
Come on out here.

300
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,090
别怕  她又不会咬你
Don't be scared. She won't bite.

301
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,450
你不会咬他吧
You won't bite him, will you?

302
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,840
你好  企鹅
Hello, Penguin.

303
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,290
你好  穆尼女士

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,130
企鹅  穆尼女士和她的老大
Penguin, Ms. Mooney and her boss,

305
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,510
法尔科内先生  感觉你对他们有失尊重
Mr. Falcone, feel disrespected by you.

306
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,960
哎呀
Oh, dear.

307
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,100
那绝非我本意
Well, that certainly has never been my intention.

308
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,450
对他们而言  尊重十分重要
Well, respect is very important to them.

309
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,790
我要你为此
Now, I want a sincere apology from you

310
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,660
诚挚地道歉
for making them feel that way.

311
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,540
天哪  当然了
Oh, gosh, of course.

312
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,100
如果我有任何地方
If I've in any way

313
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,710
让任何人感到有失尊敬的话
caused anyone to feel a lack of respect,

314
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,540
我向你道歉
I apologize.

315
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,580
由衷地致歉
Sincerely.

316
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,930
他道歉了
There you go.

317
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,020
这下可以了吧
Can't say fairer than that.

318
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,470
既然这样  那就只能见血了
Bloodshed, then.

319
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,300
很好
I'm glad.

320
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,090
快乐的胖子太无聊了
Jolly fat men are so tiresome.

321
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,940
还有你
And you...

322
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,380
你这个
you little

323
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,450
卑鄙的小杂种
scaly-faced bitch.

324
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,120
我要怎么处置你呢
What I'm gonna do to you.

325
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,620
折磨简直是太便宜你了
"Torture" is far too nice of a word.

326
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,290
很抱歉你会这么想  菲什
I'm sorry you feel that way, Fish...

327
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,930
只有我的朋友  才能叫我菲什
Only my friends... call me Fish.

328
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,070
修女们
Hey, sisters!

329
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,490
你们好吗
How's it hanging?

330
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,300
马罗尼
运输存储公司

331
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,680
马罗尼
运输存储公司

332
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,400
天呐
Holy...!

333
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,240
告诉你老大
Tell your boss

334
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,030
法尔科内是不会让马罗尼的卡车过桥的
Falcone won't let any of Maroni's trucks over the bridge.

335
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,690
除非他交出小企鹅
Not till he gives up Penguin.

336
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,750
听好了  你们得受点小伤
So, listen, you got to get hurt a little.

337
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,570
你们想挨揍还是挨子弹
You want a beating or a bullet?

338
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,640
我们为什么非要受伤
Why we got to get hurt?

339
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,240
因为我们要让你们老大知道问题的严重性
Because we're sending a message this is a serious issue.

340
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,360
我们会告诉他事态严重  放心吧
We'll tell him it's serious. No problem.

341
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,600
干脆这样吧
Ah, you know what?

342
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,690
他们怎么知道那辆运枪车的
How did they find out about the gun truck, huh?!

343
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,700
那辆车每周能赚300万啊
That's $3 mil per week right there!

344
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,950
王八蛋
Son of a bitch!

345
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,040
每周总收入450万  现金
$4.5 mil per, gross. Cash.

346
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,970
这一招很强硬啊
Very aggressive move, isn't it?

347
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,770
反应过激
An overreaction.

348
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,890
他们想吓住您
They want to scare you.

349
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,860
是嘛
Oh, is that right?

350
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,170
你认为他们觉得马罗尼阁下会害怕吗
You think that they think that Don Maroni can be scared?

351
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,030
你说得对  当然不会怕
Of course, you're right. No.

352
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,220
但是他们的反应为什么会这么激烈
But why, then, would they react so ferociously?

353
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,610
他们为什么就这么想抓我回去呢
Why do they want me back so badly?

354
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,840
我知道原因
I know why.

355
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,170
因为他们知道我这里有棵摇钱树
Because they know I got a stone moneymaker here.

356
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,870
会下金蛋的鹅
A golden goose.

357
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,060
他们知道  所以不想我们据为己有
They know it, and they don't want us to have him.

358
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,990
对吧  小企鹅
Right, Penguin?

359
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,890
呱呱
Honk, honk.

360
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,700
什么
What?

361
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,860
呱呱
Honk, honk.

362
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,630
鹅就是这么叫的
It's what geese say.

363
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,630
没错
Oh, right, right.

364
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,600
呱呱
Honk, honk.

365
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,270
好吧  他是只鹅
So, fine, he's a goose.

366
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,130
也许我们可以和他们谈判
Maybe we can negotiate a price,

367
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,730
-给他们些好处  -没错
- pay them off. - Yeah.

368
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,750
是啊
Yes.

369
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,440
谨慎是明智的
Caution is wise.

370
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,820
毕竟法尔科内家族的势力仍是最大的
The Falcone clan still is number one, after all.

371
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,940
给他们些好处比较保险
Paying them off is the safe thing to do.

372
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,350
去他的保险
Screw safe.

373
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,620
他们想逼我  让我知难而退
They want to push me? They think I'm gonna fold?

374
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,550
我会更狠地以牙还牙
I'll push right back, harder.

375
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,890
击中他们的软肋  今天就干
Hit them where it hurts. Today.

376
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,580
您心里有数
You know best.

377
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,890
如果您想这么搞
If that's how you want to play it,

378
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,030
我恰好知道软肋在哪里
I think I know just the spot to hit them.

379
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,010
我欠你一个道歉
I owe you an apology.

380
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,220
你说的是实话  但我不相信你
You were telling the truth, and I wouldn't believe you.

381
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,970
也许我对芭芭拉的个人情感
Maybe my personal feelings towards Barbara

382
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,550
影响了我的判断
got tangled up in there.

383
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,490
这是不对的
And that was wrong.

384
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,020
别在意了
Forget it.

385
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,280
不管怎样  很抱歉误会了你
Anyhow, I-I'm sorry for misjudging you,

386
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,280
我很高兴咱们是一边的
and I'm very glad that we're on the same side now.

387
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,350
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

388
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,830
那么芭芭拉安全吗
So Barbara's safe though?

389
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,900
你确定她安全吗
You're sure she's safe?

390
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,220
我很确定
I'm sure.

391
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,630
戈登  是你吗
Gordon, is that you?!

392
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,370
没事的  阿尔弗雷德
It's all right, Alfred.

393
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,800
没事的  他是朋友
It's all right. He's a friend.

394
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:51,970
我们不能冒险直接接触
We couldn't risk a direct approach;

395
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,340
有很多人在找我
there's people looking for me.

396
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,580
好吧
Ah, right.

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,860
抱歉了  伙计
Sorry about that, mate.

398
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,060
小心驶得万年船
Can't be too careful.

399
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,810
有麻烦了  是吗  先生
In a spot of bother, are we, sir?

400
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,170
芮妮・蒙托亚和克里斯帕斯・艾伦
Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen.

401
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,660
很高兴见到你们
Pleased to meet you.

402
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,910
布鲁斯  我保证过找出杀害你父母的凶手
Bruce, I promised I would find your parents' killer.

403
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,670
我不确定我还能否兑现这个承诺
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to keep that promise.

404
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,580
说来话长  但我现在身处险境
It's a long story, but I'm kind of in a tight spot.

405
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,620
我惹恼了一些有势力的人
I've upset some powerful people.

406
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,670
别再把我当个孩子了
Stop treating me like a child.

407
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,390
解释清楚
Explain.

408
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,650
布鲁斯  你就是个孩子
Bruce, you are a child.

409
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,450
你不需要知道
You don't need to know...

410
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,070
你说你可能会死
You expect to die!

411
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,740
我想知道原因
I'd like to know why.

412
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,320
是和我父母被杀有关吗
Is it connected to my parents' murder?

413
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,410
是的  这里边千丝万缕
Yes, it's all connected.

414
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,760
纠结不清
Somehow.

415
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,820
布鲁斯
Bruce...

416
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,310
我会尽全力走出困境
I will do my best to work this thing out.

417
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,450
但如果我失败了
But if I don't,

418
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,370
蒙托亚和艾伦会接手你父母的案子
Montoya and Allen here will take over your parents' case.

419
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,860
我告诉了他们我所知道的一切
I've told them everything I know.

420
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,820
你可以百分百地信任他们
You can trust them, one hundred percent.

421
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,040
百分百
One hundred percent.

422
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
布鲁斯  他们是好警探
Bruce, these are good detectives.

423
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,520
如果有谁能找出真相  那就是他们了
If anyone can find the truth, it's them.

424
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,470
谢谢你们
Thank you.

425
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,430
先生  我们现在能帮上什么忙吗
Sir, what can we do to help you now?

426
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,360
帮不上了
Nothing.

427
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,120
从现在开始  我要独自面对
From here on in, I have to go it alone.

428
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,910
我不希望再有别人被扯进来
I don't want anyone else caught up in this.

429
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,740
我得走了
I have to go.

430
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,180
你路都走不稳
You can hardly walk.

431
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,700
我没事
I'll be fine.

432
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,880
好牌
Yeah.

433
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,370
归你了
All yours.

434
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,320
太厉害了
You are good.

435
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,210
闲杂人等
请勿入内

436
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,070
这边
This way.

437
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,060
不远了
Not much further.

438
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,520
就在那儿
It's there.

439
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,440
我都说过了嘛
Told you.

440
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,100
小菜一碟
Easy as pie.

441
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,480
这里应该有一百万的东西
There must be a million dollars' worth here.

442
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,430
嗯  你是说过
Yeah, you told us, all right.

443
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,160
你真聪明
You're clever.

444
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,350
太聪明了
You're very clever.

445
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,580
你这话好强的讽刺和敌意啊
I sense a sarcastic and hostile edge to your tone.

446
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,620
敌意
Hostile?

447
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,910
你还真说对了
You got that right.

448
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,100
你才不是什么金鹅  就是一告密小人
You ain't no golden goose, you're a yellow rat snitch,

449
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,040
你把马罗尼忽悠得晕头转向
and you got Maroni all twisted.

450
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,610
终于说清楚了  我好高兴
I'm so glad we're finally clearing the air at last.

451
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,770
没错  继续耍小聪明啊
That's it. Act smart, okay?

452
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,730
因为我现在只需要
'Cause all I got to do right now

453
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,620
往你脑门崩一枪
is put a bullet in your brain right here.

454
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,720
砰
Bang.

455
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,380
然后我回去跟老大说
See, then I go back and I tell the boss

456
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,010
尼克的人把你给毙了
that one of Niko's men shot you.

457
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,530
老天啊  真可惜
Gee, that's too bad.

458
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,480
你就玩完了
End of story.

459
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,430
是啊  这计划够聪明
Yes, that's clever enough.

460
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,040
我从不怀疑你的才智
I never doubted your intelligence.

461
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,450
这不是你的弱点
That's not your problem.

462
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:52,120
我还有弱点呢  我还有弱点
Oh, I got a problem, huh? I got a problem.

463
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,630
不  有麻烦的是你
No, you got a problem.

464
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,000
我有什么弱点  蠢货
What's my problem, schmo?

465
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,510
你的动力是什么
What drives you?

466
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,520
你的激情是什么
What's your passion?

467
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,780
只要知道一个人爱什么
When you know what a man loves,

468
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,680
就能置他于死地
you know what can kill him.

469
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,870
这人真疯得没边
Do you believe this guy?

470
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,830
对你来说  就是钱
For you, it's money.

471
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,370
你爱钱
You love money.

472
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,190
胜过权利和地位
More than power and respect.

473
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,340
你是个铁公鸡  卡彭先生
You're a skinflint, Mr. Carbone.

474
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,730
吝啬鬼
A cheapskate.

475
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,280
你们这是什么意思  放手
What are you guys playing at? Let me go!

476
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,970
对不住了  弗兰基
Sorry, Frankie.

477
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,930
-正如我所说的  吝啬鬼  -放手
- As I say, a cheapskate. - Hey, come on!

478
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,700
所以
Consequently,

479
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,930
你给手下的钱太少了
you don't pay your people enough.

480
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,880
住手  你们了解我的  不要惹祸上身
No, you know me. You don't want to do this.

481
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,670
-可悲的事实是...  -别这样
- It is a sad fact... - You don't want to do this.

482
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:45,370
-住手  住手  -贼是没有忠诚可言的
- No. No. No. No! - That there is no loyalty among thieves.

483
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,300
我只是提出多给他们点钱
The simple offer of a substantial pay raise

484
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,520
这两位就同意为我做事了
is all it took to sway these fine men.

485
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,920
知道了吧  这就是你的弱点
So, you see, that's your problem!

486
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,500
你的最爱成了你最大的软肋
Your greatest passion becomes your greatest weakness!

487
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,720
爱  卡彭先生
Love, Mr. Carbone.

488
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,640
爱能战胜一切
Love conquers all.

489
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,490
我的朋友
My friend.

490
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,760
亲爱的朋友  这是忧伤的一天
My good friend, today is a sad day.

491
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,840
尼克拉与我亲如父子
Nikolai was like a son to me,

492
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,200
弗兰基对你也是如此
just as Frankie was a son to you.

493
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,210
我们都失去了至亲的家人
We've both lost precious family members.

494
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,530
我向你表示哀悼
My condolences to you.

495
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,610
我也是
And mine to you.

496
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,920
我希望暴力事件能停止
I want this violence to stop.

497
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,630
现在情势很好
Business is good.

498
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,950
阿卡姆项目就是个金矿
The Arkham Project is a gold mine.

499
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:14,110
韦恩集团也继续合作了
Wayne Enterprises is back in play.

500
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,570
大家都好好的
Life is good for all of us.

501
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,250
何必赌上一切  为点小事而搅起战火呢
Why risk all of that and go to war over trifles?

502
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,450
那个小兄弟看来对你很重要
Your little man there is obviously very valuable to you.

503
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,280
你就留着他吧
We'll let you have him.

504
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,650
我们不会再动他了
Unharmed.

505
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,720
算是送你的礼物
Our gift to you.

506
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,970
不过礼尚往来  你也得表现出诚意
And as a show of mutual respect, you give us something in return.

507
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,300
比如呢
Like such as what?

508
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,390
地产如何
How about real estate?

509
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,170
不如就拿你们河边的一间仓库吧
One of your warehouses on the river maybe.

510
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,890
这可不行
That's not gonna work.

511
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,420
我喜欢这孩子
I mean, I like this fella,

512
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,950
但要用河边的仓库换的话...
but we're talking about a warehouse on the river.

513
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,450
好
Yeah.

514
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,530
印第安山
Indian Hill.

515
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,700
我可以把印第安山给你
I'll give you Indian Hill.

516
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,680
这地方我不太熟
I'm not familiar with the name.

517
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,250
在阿卡姆
It's in Arkham.

518
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,240
建在印第安坟场上的有毒废料填埋场
It's a toxic waste dump on top of an Indian burial ground.

519
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,780
毫无价值
It's worthless.

520
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,530
不
No.

521
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,160
任何东西都是有价值的
Nothing is worthless.

522
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,100
即使一分不值  也能有所用处
Even nothing is worth something.

523
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,160
我们要了
We'll take it.

524
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,160
算是我们相互尊重的象征  好吗
As a token of our mutual respect, yes?

525
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,550
当然  朋友
You got it, my friend.

526
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,460
多和气啊
It's all love.

527
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,960
很高兴见到你们
It's a pleasure seeing you all.

528
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,890
听说维克・萨斯大闹了哥谭警局
Um, I heard Vic Zsasz tore up the GCPD,

529
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,460
想找到戈登
tracking down Gordon.

530
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,900
抓到他了吗
Did you catch him yet?

531
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,350
还在办
We're working on it.

532
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,790
祝你们好运了
Well, good luck with that.

533
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,610
正直的人最危险了  对吧
There's nothing more dangerous than an honest man, huh?

534
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:11,030
小吉姆  是我  快开门
Jimbo, it's me. Open up.

535
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,440
别担心  我不是来杀你的
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.

536
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,210
我应该杀了你的  但我不会的
I should, but I ain't.

537
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,410
那太好了
Glad to hear it.

538
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,990
显然  你选了他们肯定不会找的地方
Obviously, you figured you'd go to the last place they'd look,

539
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,970
因为这太明显  他们压根不会来这儿搜
because it'd be the first place they'd reject as being too obvious.

540
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,210
抱歉  我忘了介绍了
I-I'm sorry, I'm being rude.

541
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,010
这位是德文郡公爵夫人
This is the Duchess of Devonshire.

542
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,750
夫人  这是吉姆・戈登  是个白痴
Duchess, Jim Gordon, putz.

543
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,160
我是玛莎  你好啊
Marsha. Hi.

544
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,920
宝贝儿  你去逛逛吧
Baby, why don't you explore a little bit.

545
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,820
去卧室  换身凉快的衣服
Find the bedroom, put on your birthday suit.

546
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:42,700
我过会儿就去找你  好吗
And I'll find you in a jiffy, okay?

547
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:45,980
我考虑过了
So I've been thinking.

548
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,230
你还是个混蛋
You're still a douche bag.

549
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,190
但在理的是你
But you have the moral high ground.

550
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,500
所以我决定帮你一把  不管你想干什么
So I'm gonna back your play, whatever it is.

551
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,730
反正我横竖都是死
I figure I'm doomed anyhow.

552
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,410
倒不如跟好人搏一把
I might as well join the good guys.

553
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,310
多谢
Thank you.

554
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,800
你有什么计划
So what is your play?

555
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,890
你有计划吧  你说过你有的
I mean, you got one, right? You said you did.

556
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,760
明早我会逮捕法尔科内和市长
Tomorrow morning, I'm arresting Falcone and the mayor

557
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,390
指控他们陷害马里奥・佩珀
for the framing of Mario Pepper.

558
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,670
共谋  妨碍司法公正  腐败  全套
Conspiracy, POJ, Rico, the works.

559
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,950
你这...好个计划啊
Well, that's a... that's a hell of a plan.

560
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,790
你是不是跟一帮大猩猩
You sit down with a panel of chimpanzees

561
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,830
抽着可卡因想出来的
and a bucket of crack and come up with that one?

562
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,340
我琢磨不管结果如何  我们都会掀起波澜
I figure whatever else happens, we'll stir things up.

563
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,590
没准还能登报呢
We might even make the papers.

564
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,210
登报是肯定的
Oh, yeah, we're gonna make the papers, all right.

565
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,790
我们会横死街头
We're gonna be dead in the streets

566
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,440
正好能上晚报了
in time for the evening edition.

567
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,680
至少人民会知道真相
Well, at least the people will know the truth.

568
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,320
而我们会尽忠职守  为执法献身
And we'll go out doing our jobs, enforcing the law.

569
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,340
你就这么几句鼓励士气的屁话吗
That's the best inspirational speech you got?

570
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,580
尽忠职守
Doing our jobs?

571
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,250
你不用跟我一起来的
You don't have to join me.

572
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,400
不  我肯定加入
No, I'm game.

573
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,350
我说过  我横竖都是死
Like I said, I'm doomed anyhow.

574
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,200
现在  我要失陪一会儿了
Now, if you'll excuse me for one minute,

575
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,950
我还有点正事儿要办
just gonna take care of some business.

576
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,150
公爵夫人啊
Duchess!

577
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,790
马可
Marco!

578
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,830
波罗
Polo!

579
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,260
吓死我了
Jumping catfish.

580
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,130
早上好  詹姆斯市长
Good morning, Mayor James.

581
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,610
戈登  你吓着...
Gordon, you scared...

582
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:10,230
你吓死我了
scared the bejeebers out of me.

583
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,600
差点把咖啡都洒了
Almost spilled my coffee.

584
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,460
抱歉
Sorry.

585
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,230
市长  你被逮捕了
Sir, you're under arrest.

586
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,310
这可不好笑
That's not funny.

587
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,800
看听众是谁了
Depends where you're sitting.

588
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,060
你还是看看这个吧
Might want to take a look at this.

589
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,080
几位好啊
How you doing, guys?

590
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,380
我来见法尔科内先生
I'm here to have a chat with Mr. Falcone.

591
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,140
好的  市长先生
Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.

592
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,380
卡麦・法尔科内  你被捕了
Carmine Falcone, you're under arrest.

593
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:04,800
进去
Move.

594
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,100
都给我趴在那儿  别乱动
Lie down right over there. Stay quiet.

595
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,360
你这是想干什么
What on earth are you thinking?

596
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,020
我们想把你们俩一起送进监狱
We're thinking we'll take you both to jail

597
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,120
然后起诉你们共谋妨碍司法公正
and charge you with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

598
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,160
你要逮捕我  都别想活着走过街尾
Try and take me in, you won't make it to the end of the street.

599
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,310
我也是这么说的
That's exactly what I said.

600
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,000
这是合法逮捕  如果你拘捕  我们会开枪
This is a lawful arrest. If you resist, you will be shot.

601
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,950
这样啊
I see.

602
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,430
我们一起死个英勇壮烈
We all die together in a blaze of glory.

603
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,240
如果结局如此  我也不介意
If that's how it works out, that's fine with me.

604
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,280
你呢  哈维
How about you, Harvey?

605
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,400
不介意
Fine by me.

606
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,710
-老天啊  -我真羡慕你们
- Oh, God. - I envy you boys.

607
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,460
了无牵挂的感觉一定很轻松
Having nothing to lose must be liberating.

608
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,960
一定很不错
Must feel pretty good.

609
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,010
是啊
Yes, it does.

610
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,510
那如果你确实有什么牵挂呢
Suppose you did have something to lose.

611
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,550
你要怎么办
What would you do then?

612
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,260
比如
Suppose, for instance,

613
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,680
如果芭芭拉・基恩的脖子上现在正架着刀呢
I had a knife to Barbara Kean's throat right now.

614
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,540
你还会这么勇敢吗
Would you still be so brave?

615
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,550
这不是真的
You don't.

616
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,110
我告诉你是真的
I'm telling you I do.

617
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,250
你撒谎
You're a liar.

618
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,090
我有很多过失  但我不撒谎
I have many faults, but I'm not a liar.

619
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,420
芭芭拉在维克多・萨斯手上
Victor Zsasz has Barbara.

620
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,800
你认识维克多的
You know Victor.

621
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,580
你撒谎  她已经远走高飞了
You're lying. She's far away.

622
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,710
她回来了
She came back.

623
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,690
跑来我这儿为你求情
Came right to me to plead for your life.

624
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,500
你的女朋友真不错
You have a good woman there.

625
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,420
她非常爱你
She loves you very much.

626
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,750
太爱你了
Too much.

627
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,450
拿出证据
Prove it.

628
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,110
证明她在你手里
Prove you have her.

629
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,930
我当然可以
I could.

630
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,720
但我不会那么做
But I won't.

631
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,420
我要你相信我
I want you to believe me.

632
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,840
吉姆  他显然是在撒谎
It's obvious, Jim. He's lying.

633
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,150
是吗
Am I?

634
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,360
如果你是这么想
If you think so,

635
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,450
那就逮捕我吧
go ahead and try to bring me in.

636
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,790
你必死无疑
You'll be dead,

637
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,980
也就不会知道芭芭拉的命运会如何
so you won't know what happens to Barbara.

638
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,220
但肯定会很糟糕
But it won't be pretty.

639
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,430
撒谎
Lying.

640
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,910
以我母亲的坟墓起誓
On my mother's grave.

641
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,270
放下枪
Drop your gun,

642
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,610
芭芭拉就不会受到伤害
and Barbara won't be harmed in any way.

643
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,300
小松糕真香啊
Those muffins smell good.

644
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,900
不是给你的  变态
None for you, creep.

645
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,380
她如果想要  可以吃一个
She can have one if she wants.

646
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,070
不了  谢谢
No, thank you.

647
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,160
是
Got it.

648
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,660
可惜了
What a shame.

649
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,540
丢人丢到姥姥家了  他把你唬得投降了
Oh, this is embarrassing; he straight-up bluffed you into folding.

650
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,050
我们本可像英雄那样死去  这下要喂鱼了
We could've gone out like heroes; now we're fish food.

651
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,360
好吧  还真不是唬人
Okay, so it wasn't a bluff.

652
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,890
如果她受了点小伤  我很抱歉
I'm sorry if she was mistreated a little.

653
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,700
我们得确定她没有什么有用的信息
We needed to be sure she had nothing useful to tell us.

654
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,380
松绑  维克多
Untie her, Victor.

655
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,540
对不起
I'm sorry.

656
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,610
没事  没事了
It's okay. It's okay.

657
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,680
我要拿你怎么办啊
What am I gonna do with you?

658
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,160
按理说  你必须死
By rights, you have to die.

659
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,300
哎呦  我上班要迟到了
Whoa, hello. Uh, I'm late for work.

660
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,560
真是惊险刺激  我这就走了
Quite an adventure. I'll be on my way.

661
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,400
但真是可惜了
Such a waste though.

662
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,900
哥谭需要你这样的人  需要你们两个
Gotham needs men like you, both of you.

663
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,050
有原则的硬汉
Strong men with principles.

664
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,580
真希望我能让你明白  我不是你们的敌人
I wish I could make you see I'm not the enemy.

665
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,700
这个体制也不是敌人
The system is not the enemy.

666
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,650
混乱才是敌人
The enemy is anarchy.

667
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,050
但这我不是早就说过  吉姆
But I told you that before, didn't I, Jim?

668
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,190
是啊
Yes, you did.

669
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,140
但你却没听进去
You didn't listen though.

670
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,340
我们还有最后的晚餐  香烟什么的吗
Do we get a last meal or a smoke or anything,

671
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,690
还是就干耍嘴皮子
or just talk?

672
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,030
但今天  你相信了我
But today, you believed me.

673
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,870
你相信了我的话
You trusted my word.

674
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,440
这是很好的第一步
That's a good first step.

675
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:40,810
或许你还有希望
Perhaps there's still hope for you.

676
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,570
没错
Yes.

677
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,010
走吧  快走  趁我还没改主意
Go. Get out of here before I change my mind.

678
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,730
-等等  -闭嘴
- Wait a minute. - Quiet.

679
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,510
有幸认识你  芭芭拉
It's been a pleasure, Barbara.

680
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,250
我欣赏勇敢的女人
I do admire a brave woman.

681
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,970
你打的什么主意
What's the catch?

682
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,270
吉姆  他说可以走了  别磨叽了
Jim, he said we could go. Let's not haggle here.

683
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,190
你打的什么主意  法尔科内先生
What's the catch, Mr. Falcone?

684
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,730
我要你好好想想我的话
I want you to think about what I said.

685
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,730
我希望你能理解真理
I want you to understand the truth.

686
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,790
别无所求
That's all I ask.

687
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,290
我打的主意是
The catch is...

688
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,680
很快  你就会明白我是对的
someday soon, you'll see I'm right.

689
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,490
芭芭拉
Barbara...

690
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

691
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,110
我是想帮忙
I was just trying to help, and...

692
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,370
我不知道我...
I don't know what...

693
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,490
我好爱你
I love you so much.

694
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,930
太棒了
Excellent.

695
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,170
真好吃
Delicious!

696
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,130
好啊
Yes.

697
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,580
我严格按照食谱做的
I followed the recipe.

698
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,640
你说得对  法先生  烹饪很简单
You're right, Mr. F., cooking is easy.

699
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,630
抱歉之前让你目睹那种事
I'm sorry you had to see all that earlier.

700
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,830
太不好了
Not pleasant.

701
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,610
我理解的
I understand.

702
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,650
生意就是生意嘛
Business is business.

703
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,170
是啊
Yes, it is.

704
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,860
我去看看鸡
I'll go see to the chickens.

705
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,810
下蛋了吗  亲爱的
Any eggs, my dears?

706
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,380
法尔科内阁下
Don Falcone.

707
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,180
我的朋友
My friend.

708
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,340
见到你真好
Good to see you.

709
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,070
我正在想我们遇见的那天晚上呢
I was just thinking about the night we met.

710
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:18,630
放他们下来
Cut them down.

711
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,570
那个告密的呢
Where's the snitch?

712
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,050
我要跟他说话
I want to speak to him.

713
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,310
科波特  是吧
Cobblepot, is it?

714
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,450
人之将死其言也善
Condemned men are honest men, I find.

715
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,810
你死前有什么能跟我说的
What can you tell me before you go?

716
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,460
法尔科内阁下
Don Falcone.

717
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,680
真是太荣幸了  先生
It is a great honor, sir.

718
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,520
我可以告诉您一个很有价值的秘密
Indeed, I can tell a secret of great value to you...

719
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,050
只要您答应我最后一个要求
if you grant me one last request.

720
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,100
什么要求
Which is what?

721
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,230
把杀我的任务交给詹姆斯・戈登
Give the job of killing me to James Gordon.

722
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,730
为什么
Why him?

723
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:10,240
他是受您摆布的人中  唯一有良心的
He's the only man under your sway who has a conscience.

724
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,420
他是唯一可能饶我一命的人
The only one who might be persuaded to spare my life.

725
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,650
我凭什么要答应你
Why would I agree to that?

726
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,780
我想要你死  你是个告密鬼
I want you dead. You're a snitch.

727
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,240
如果您同意  而戈登又饶了我一命
If you agree and Gordon spares me,

728
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:24,940
那我就做您的眼线
then I will become your snitch.

729
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,600
永远
For life.

730
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,120
我会换个名字回到哥谭
I will come back to Gotham under a different name,

731
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,270
我会想办法打入马罗尼家族
and I will work my way into the Maroni family,

732
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,910
我会为您提供消息
and I will snitch for you.

733
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,600
我非常擅长做这种事
I am excellent at this sort of work.

734
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,960
我有这方面的天赋  真的  先生
I have a gift for it. I really do, sir.

735
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,160
好
Deal.

736
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,930
我会让戈登去杀你
Gordon will get the job of killing you.

737
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,830
谢谢  先生
Thank you, sir.

738
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,140
那个有价值的秘密是什么
What is the valuable secret?

739
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,660
对了
Oh, yes.

740
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:11,920
菲什・穆尼和俄国人尼古拉只是假装不睦
Fish Mooney and Nikolai the Russian only pretend to hate each other.

741
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,320
他们是情人
They're lovers.

742
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:18,230
菲什在鼓动尼古拉夺您的权
And Fish is pushing Nikolai to take your place.

743
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,210
是嘛
Is that so?

744
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,180
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

745
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,290
但菲什只是为了再夺他的权
But only so Fish can take over from him.

746
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,130
真是个好秘密
That is a good secret.

747
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,930
简直难以置信
It's almost uncanny.

748
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,670
一切正如你所说的那样
Everything played out exactly as you said it would.

749
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,070
我们轻松除掉了尼古拉
We got rid of Nikolai painlessly,

750
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:45,170
马罗尼则把你当宝贝
and Maroni thinks you're a wizard.

751
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,290
你的确很有天赋
You really do have a gift.

752
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,160
但我觉得放走戈登是个错误
But I think we're making a mistake letting Gordon live.

753
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,070
他会惹麻烦
He's trouble.

754
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:56,800
多谢您饶他一命
Thank you so much for sparing him.

755
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,310
多谢您给这个面子
I appreciate the favor.

756
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,980
别担心
Don't worry.

757
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,990
他会明白过来的
He'll see the light.

758
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,270
无论如何  我保证
One way or another. I guarantee it.
