17
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,970
Get you another?

18
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,790
Um... no. That's okay. Thanks.

20
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,100
Hey, Blair. It's me.

21
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,120
I've called you a bunch of times.

22
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,260
I've left you a bunch of messages

23
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,050
tried the office and...

24
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,090
I'm gonna head home 'cause it's been a long day

25
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,160
but if you could call me, that would be...

26
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,060
really great.

27
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,160
Kev, I need you to do me a favor,

28
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,900
and I want it off the books.

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,780
Yeah, his car's here.

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm gonna try calling him again.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,620
I'll call you back, Kev. Thanks.

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,230
Blair?

33
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,460
Blair!

34
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,800
Oh, hey, hey! Stay with me, okay?

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,720
Stay with me I'm-- I'm calling 911.

36
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,490
Blair, I need you to stay with me, okay? Blair!

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,680
Stay with me, stay with me.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,870
Just breathe, okay? I'm right here. I'm right here.

39
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,980
We're okay. We're okay.

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,090
Burgess? Kim?

42
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,620
- Kim! Kim, look at me. - Yeah.

43
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,870
They got him. His pulse is still steady.

44
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,000
You did real good. What happened?

45
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,090
I don't know.

46
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,870
I saw his car, his cell phone rang,

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,070
it brought me here.

48
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,630
But I--I--it looks like two small caliber rounds,

49
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,240
but I didn't see any shell casings,

50
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,470
- so I don't really know. - Hey, Kim.

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,650
You all right?

52
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,420
By the time I got here, the street was completely empty

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,910
and his car was cold.

54
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,100
So I say that we ping his cell phone, right?

55
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,060
- Hank. - Because that will let us

56
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,820
find out exactly what time he got here.

57
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,410
- All right, we'll do that. - Yeah.

58
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,570
Come on. Come on.

59
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,940
The victim's Kelton's consultant, Blair?

60
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,610
Yeah, two GSWs being transported to Lakeshore Memorial.

61
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,370
So what the hell was he doing out here?

62
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,140
I don't have an answer to that yet.

63
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,120
Well, the less you tell the public, the better.

64
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,070
Understood.

65
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,910
Remember, my team's got a connection to this kid.

66
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,140
We got the same agenda on this.

67
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,690
We find something ugly, we're gonna keep it private.

68
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,710
All right.

69
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,440
Well, Kelton's on campaign stops all this week...

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,500
If I need you, I know where to find you.

71
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,380
All right.

72
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,370
- Kim all right? - Yeah.

73
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,480
Okay, I ran the address through NADDIS.

74
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,790
Pretty much what you'd expect.

75
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,630
Uh, area's known for trafficking.

76
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,630
There's two houses on the block that are both indexed.

77
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,880
Known suppliers in each.

78
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,950
All right, well we're gonna have to run both.

79
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,180
Question is anybody know if Blair had a problem with drugs?

80
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,980
No. He barely even drinks.

81
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,740
Sarge, I got something.

82
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,350
There's at least 20k in there.

83
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,040
All small denominations.

84
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,870
All right.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,670
Well, work your CIs.

86
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,060
Reach out to Gangs, Narcotics,

87
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,140
farm for witnesses, PODS.

88
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,500
If they haven't been shot up, we might get lucky.

89
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,080
Yeah, I'm gonna head to the hospital.

90
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,770
- Kim. - Yeah?

91
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,750
I just got talked to the hospital detail.

92
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,910
Blair coded in the ambulance.

93
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,990
He died en route.

94
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,660
I'm very sorry.

95
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,660
- Hey. - Hey. You okay?

96
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,900
- Yeah. - Okay.

97
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,620
I talked to Platt and, uh,

98
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,910
Blair's family has been notified.

99
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,780
They're hopping on planes from Connecticut now.

100
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,690
Okay.

101
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,240
Did you, um, speak to Voight?

102
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,020
He really running this as a drug-related homicide?

103
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,480
Yeah, for now.

104
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,100
But we'll see where the evidence takes us.

105
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,640
Want me to give you a ride to the airport

106
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,130
so you could meet the family when they land?

107
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,660
No, I cannot do that.

108
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,730
I was meeting him last night to break up.

109
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,040
So I was gonna tell him not to move to Chicago.

110
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,560
Not for me anyway.

111
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,090
So I--I can't sit with his family, Kev.

112
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,270
I don't belong there. I don't belong there.

113
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,450
No, I understand.

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,220
So what do you want to do?

115
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,210
I want to work.

116
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,020
Copy that. Let's work.

118
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,750
Blair Williams, 32 years old.

119
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,210
Born and raised in Connecticut, wealthy family.

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,850
Studied politics at Princeton,

121
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,000
moved to DC shortly after graduating.

122
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,010
Spent his whole career as a political consultant.

123
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,440
Good reputation too.

124
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,010
Been in Chicago the last two months working for Kelton.

125
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,970
Found last night, 10:18 P.M., two GSWs.

126
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,840
So far, nothing on forensics or ballistics yet.

127
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,830
Hmm. Okay. Blair got any link to drugs?

128
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,890
Any priors?

129
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,840
Yeah, believe it or not,

130
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,620
he got popped for possession at 17.

131
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,140
He got pulled over on a traffic stop

132
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,950
and the cops found seven grams of cocaine on him.

133
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,660
All right, so he didn't get charged

134
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,180
with intent to distribute?

135
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:06,910
No.

136
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,130
Apparently his parents had pretty good lawyers.

137
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,800
Ran through Blair's texts and calls.

138
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,980
mostly business, personal texts,

139
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,410
but there is one that stands out as being a little strange.

140
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,340
It was a conversation with a burner phone.

141
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,200
Looks like Blair was trying to buy something.

142
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,820
Blair to the burner, "Will give you a good price."

143
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,060
The burner responds, "Meet me 8 P.M. The Green Lounge."

144
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,790
Let me see.

145
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,430
Sounds like a drug deal to me.

146
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,190
Green Lounge, that's that bar outside Englewood, right?

147
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,450
Yeah. Lots of drugs, lots of fights.

148
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,600
- Roll on it. - You got it, Boss.

149
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,420
- Kev? - Yup.

150
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,930
Kev, I'm going.

151
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,940
Okay.

152
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,700
We're not open for another two hours.

153
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,820
We're not drinking.

154
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,340
- Need to ask you a few questions. - You can ask all you want

155
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,690
but I make it a point not to pay attention to our customers.

156
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,010
- Is that so? - Yeah.

157
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,080
Makes it a hell of a lot easier not to answer you.

158
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,440
Hey, did you see him in here last night?

159
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,880
Nah. Don't believe so.

160
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,610
Yo! What the hell?

161
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,110
My partner asked you to look at a photo, so look.

162
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,090
Otherwise I see broken glass. That's a clear code violation.

163
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,540
Give me the phone.

164
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,410
Yeah, he was here last night.

165
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,210
Spent about half hour at the bar.

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,570
Who was he with?

167
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,320
Some black dude I've never seen before.

168
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,050
They came in, had a drink, talked, left.

169
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,370
- Good enough? - No.

170
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,650
Did you hear what they were talking about?

171
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,340
Did you hear a name?

172
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,880
Do you have a better description than "Black dude"?

173
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,660
They were talking about money.

174
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,480
If you want my opinion, it's exactly what it looked like.

175
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,760
Rich prick comes to the hood

176
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,600
to slum out on some Englewood coke.

177
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,550
- Do you have security cameras? - Do you see any cameras?

178
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,280
That exit go out to the parking lot?

179
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,240
Yeah.

180
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,330
- You okay? - Fine. I'm fine.

181
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,100
Look, I know you didn't know him for very long,

182
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,210
but I know you, I know you feel things deeply.

183
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,940
That's how it was with us anyway.

184
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,170
I'm just trying to tell you, if you need somebody to lean on...

185
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,460
you know, I got your back.

186
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,700
If he left out the back, that camera might've caught him.

187
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,130
- There. - Is that Blair?

188
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,010
The clothes are a match.

189
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,000
- Got him. - Yeah.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,020
Blue Buick.

191
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,460
Plate is John-7-7-4-0-8-9.

193
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,990
Well, that's different.

194
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,140
Car's registered to First City Fellowship

195
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,260
in Englewood.

196
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,820
That's a church.

197
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,230
Jay. Blue Buick.

198
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
What is Blair doing hanging out with a Reverend

199
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,730
at a bar known for rocks and blows?

200
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah.

201
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,550
Reverend Dennis?

203
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,740
Reverend Dennis, Chicago PD.

204
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:27,790
Body.

205
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,540
5021 Henry.

206
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,090
Male victim, GSW to the hip, GSW to the neck.

207
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,010
Roll an ambo to 4329 South 51st Street.

208
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,510
Reverend? Dennis? Dennis, can you talk?

209
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,800
Who shot you?

210
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,480
Help's on the way, okay? Stay with us. Stay with us.

211
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,490
I think he was bleeding out for a while.

212
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,980
There's no witnesses, no phone.

213
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,690
The shooter probably snatched it.

214
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,590
Looks like Dennis might have known the shooter.

215
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,580
He was in the back making tea when it happened.

216
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,800
- No signs of a struggle. - Yeah, there were four casings

217
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,010
which means the shooter missed twice at close range.

218
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,230
So he was not a professional.

219
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,510
Hey, this guy Dennis?

220
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,580
Are we sure that he's a legitimate reverend?

221
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,610
Yeah, he was ordained.

222
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,220
Well, Blair wasn't religious.

223
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,670
So I have no idea why he was meeting with a reverend.

224
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,890
Uh, ballistics came back as a match.

225
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,660
9mm that killed Blair killed Dennis too.

226
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,220
Okay.

227
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,530
Maybe he's a political donor.

228
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,760
They were meeting to maybe talk about the election.

229
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,160
I ran that theory up the ladder.

230
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,750
- Yeah? - No one from Kelton's staff

231
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,660
recognized the name.

232
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,560
Did they know if Blair had any enemies?

233
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,560
None that stood out as anything more than political divides.

234
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,140
I mean, all they said was Kelton is really pissed

235
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,600
that he's way behind in the polls,

236
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,820
that everyone was pretty much drowning in it.

237
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,210
Except for Blair.

238
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,450
He had been talking about a new opportunity he had,

239
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,880
but no one knew what he meant by that.

240
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,020
Guys, listen to this:

241
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,260
if this brother's a man of God now,

242
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,700
that was not always the case.

243
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,270
He's got three drug charges.

244
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,640
Full name Dennis Reed,

245
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,210
spent a decade of his life running drugs

246
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,400
for the G Park Lords before he found the church.

247
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:09,440
Well, well, well.

248
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,100
Maybe it was never a full turn.

249
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,910
Just faith as a front.

250
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,130
Church is a good place to funnel money.

251
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,340
He's still dealing, he meets Blair somehow,

252
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,290
they see a chance to make some money,

253
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,470
do some business, a new opportunity.

254
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,820
Then someone swoops in,

255
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,690
kills them both to end the sale.

256
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,350
All right, let's just take it step by step.

257
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,500
First let's confirm that Dennis was still actually dealing.

258
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,060
And search Blair's hotel.

259
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,300
I mean, if these two were moving heavy product together,

260
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,680
they were wearing damn good masks for the world.

261
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,860
Let's peel 'em back.

262
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,920
Uh, hey, Burgess, Dawson?

263
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,530
This is Maya Williams, Blair's sister.

264
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,950
She was hoping to get an update on the case.

265
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,250
Hi. I just landed and I came here

266
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,280
'cause I was hoping to get some answers.

267
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,300
Something? Anything?

268
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,780
Hey, you know what? Uh...

269
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,820
why don't we go talk over here?

270
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,020
No, I got this one.

271
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,630
You get the boxes. I'll meet you in the car?

272
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,040
Okay, sure.

273
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,680
Okay.

274
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,050
So are there any official suspects yet?

275
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,560
- Yeah, we have a few leads. - Okay.

276
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,080
Okay. Um, Maya?

277
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,650
Did your brother have an issue with drugs?

278
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,540
Using or dealing or...

279
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,950
You're asking me that because of his arrest in high school.

280
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,120
The coke.

281
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,470
I am, but he was also found in an area

282
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,520
known for drug trafficking, so...

283
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,910
You know, our family's always been a little, um...

284
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,880
complicated.

285
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,230
So the night that Blair got arrested.

286
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,950
My father was with him.

287
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,760
The drugs were his.

288
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,930
My father's an addict.

289
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,990
Blair took the rap?

290
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,270
Yeah.

291
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,100
It's just what we did, you know?

292
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,880
We all covered for my father's illness.

293
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,370
His intentions were good.

294
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,980
- Go ahead. - Thank you.

298
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
- Kim. - Yeah.

299
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,280
Found it in the nightstand. It's got your name on it.

300
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,610
I thought you might wanna open it.

301
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,690
- Sarge. - Anything?

302
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,530
Nah, no drugs, no cash. Found a laptop.

303
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,340
Let me take it to CPIC now, see if they can get into it.

304
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,800
- Great. - Files, documents, binders.

305
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,830
Lots more in the car. Mostly on Price.

306
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,980
Some on his daughter, Jasmine.

307
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,200
Probably looking into her to find dirt on Ray.

308
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,550
Looking for a weak spot.

309
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,460
Right.

310
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,250
- Boss. - Yeah.

311
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,140
I think I got something on Dennis.

312
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,930
A few members from his church were worried

313
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,860
he had one foot in, one foot out.

314
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,010
His one foot out is this girl right here.

315
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,950
Kasey Hartman?

316
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,910
Yeah, she's known him since his glory days with the G Parks.

317
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,230
They stay in heavy contact,

318
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,320
only she's not so clean, she's not so holy.

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,340
I'm thinking she could tell us who the real Dennis is.

320
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,750
You and me.

321
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,420
No one thought to come to me when he was found.

322
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,370
I hear it from those church people

323
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,000
and now you finally come and you just want to know

324
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,240
if he was dealing?

325
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,630
What, since he was screwing me he had to be?

326
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,830
I don't think that.

327
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,930
I think you knew him and...

328
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,760
I think that means you might be able to help us.

329
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,150
Well, I don't know what he was up to

330
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,420
and I don't know anyone named Blair Williams.

331
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,100
Well, Kasey, we're just trying to help.

332
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,690
So anything you could think of would be a big help to us.

333
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,190
It's probably nothing.

334
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,350
You know, a lot of times it's the nothing that helps us most.

335
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,070
I met him for dinner a couple of days ago.

336
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,190
He was late. He's never late.

337
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,170
20 minutes after we were supposed to meet,

338
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,390
a silver Escalade drops him off.

339
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,460
He was upset. Wouldn't say who it was.

340
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,190
I thought maybe-- maybe he fell off.

341
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,490
Okay, you said silver Escalade.

342
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,850
Did you see who was inside?

343
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,780
Nah, the windows were tinted.

344
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,200
But it was some kind of official car.

345
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,880
Had a--a placard and a slogan sticker.

346
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,890
Future--Future Chicago. Something like that

347
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,250
Hank.

348
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,360
Hey, Alicia. Is your husband--

349
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,620
Hey, baby, I told you I had the door--

350
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,690
Hank.

351
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,630
What's going on?

352
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,530
You tell me, Ray.

353
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,510
Special Reserve. You want a glass?

354
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,670
Uh, no thanks. I'm on duty.

355
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,260
So I'll give you a short pour.

356
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,730
So what's going on, Hank?

357
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,220
Reverend Dennis Reed.

358
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,930
- What about him? - How do you know him?

359
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:10,590
Well, he's lived in my ward all his life.

360
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,140
When's the last time you saw him?

361
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:17,550
Hank, the questions, the tone.

362
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,240
Just tell me what the hell is going on.

363
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,780
When's the last time you talked to him, Ray?

364
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,320
A few days ago.

365
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,860
And what did you and the good reverend discuss?

366
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,010
"The good reverend"?

367
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,170
Come on, man.

368
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,150
Dennis Reed is a cold coke-slinging punk.

369
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,520
- That right? - Yeah.

370
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,700
This reverend thing is just a joke.

371
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,620
Hmm.

372
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,460
Well, word was that he was selling product again.

373
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,180
- On his own. - Huh.

374
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,130
So I went to him and said, "Back off."

375
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,920
And, you know, find some new hustle or something

376
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,460
that wasn't gonna get him killed.

377
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,880
It's three weeks away from the election.

378
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,040
I don't need any more bodies being dropped in my ward.

379
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,710
Well, it looks like Dennis didn't heed your advice.

380
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,960
He was found dead in his church.

381
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,590
Shot twice.

382
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,800
Son of a bitch.

383
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,010
He couldn't stay out of his own damn way?

384
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,540
Any idea who might've pulled the trigger?

385
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,220
Well, if he was really, uh, dealing.

386
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,210
I'm guessing the local shot-caller took him out.

387
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,970
Guy by the name of Nate Lewis.

388
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,220
Straight up, cold-blooded gangster.

389
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,190
Hmm.

390
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,550
He's been selling blow and killing young black men

391
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,080
for the last ten years.

392
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,420
If I was a betting man, he's your shooter.

393
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,410
Huh.

394
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,850
Chicago PD!

395
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,240
Nate Lewis, open the door!

396
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,430
Okay, okay. You can stop with all the yelling, man.

397
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,510
- What the hell is this about? - Sir, we just want to talk.

398
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,290
- You got a warrant? - No.

399
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,310
Then y'all can keep stepping. I don't talk to the police.

400
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,990
Well, you know, sometimes talking is a lot easier than not talking.

401
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,770
- Threatening me? - Of course not.

402
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,390
I'm just saying, if you answer a few questions,

403
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,000
you'll save us a lot of time--

404
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,230
What he's really saying, Nate, is either we talk now

405
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,210
or we come back in the middle of the night with a warrant

406
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,210
- and we toss your house and car. - Man, y'all can kiss my ass.

407
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,350
I see drugs on the table in plain view.

408
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,620
Get against the wall! Against the wall!

409
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,110
Man, I got no drugs out here. I'm not an idiot, man!

410
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,990
- You know Blair Williams? - No, never heard of him.

411
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,190
Turn around, put your hands on the wall.

412
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,140
- Man, what the hell, man? - Yo, yo, yo.

413
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,370
I need you to not step up on me.

414
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,640
Turn around and put your hands on the wall.

415
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,610
- Resisting arrest? - No!

416
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,430
That's enough to charge you.

417
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,240
Sit down. I want you to sit down.

418
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,030
Hands up, man. Hands up. Sit down.

419
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,920
Clear.

420
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,340
Ruze.

421
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,600
Lucky.

422
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,100
We got a positive.

423
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,090
Antonio, we're checking the garage now.

424
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,170
Copy that.

425
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,630
Gun.

426
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,300
9mm.

427
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,120
Like I keep saying,

428
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,150
I don't know nothing about those murders or no damn gun.

429
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,330
Yeah, the problem is, bro,

430
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:38,570
that damn gun is the damn murder weapon

431
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,430
of Dennis Reed and Blair Williams.

432
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,920
Blair Williams? I--I never met that dude!

433
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,380
Nate, I don't care if you never met him

434
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,050
or you knew him or you went camping together.

435
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,440
What matters is, you killed him.

436
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,480
I don't know who or what you're talking about.

437
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,600
But you did know Dennis?

438
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,630
Sure, I've known him for years.

439
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:55,000
And you got angry because he started dealing again in your territory.

440
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,650
No, no, no, no. I got upset because he started shaking my ass down

441
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,910
- for donations to his church. - Come on, Nate.

442
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,830
- I never talked to him about drugs! - Nate, Nate!

443
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,240
Listen to me.

444
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,890
We got the murder weapon and we got motive.

445
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,500
You wanted to end the sale.

446
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,190
With your resume,

447
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,210
that's enough to put you away for life. You understand?

448
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,880
So we're trying to do you a favor.

449
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,160
Now give us your version of the story,

450
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,890
the ASA will take that into consideration.

451
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,640
Man, I'm done talking.

452
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,020
Lawyer.

453
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,910
Lawyer or no lawyer,

454
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,360
we got enough to charge him.

455
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,670
Kim, look, I know it's not a perfect result,

456
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,030
but at least it's something.

457
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,740
Yeah, I guess.

460
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,020
I'm not a damn china doll, Adam.

461
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,980
You don't have to keep checking on me

462
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,230
Talk to me.

463
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,240
Just talk to me.

464
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,460
Blair wanted to stay in Chicago,

465
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,730
but I was gonna tell him to leave.

466
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,630
That, you know, I didn't see us together long-term.

467
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,260
I should've told him to stay.

468
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,350
Yeah.

469
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,890
I should've told him I was falling in love with him.

470
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,530
He was a good person. He was an honest person.

471
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,990
There's no way in hell that he was looking into a drug deal

472
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,410
with a half-assed reverend named Dennis.

473
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,490
No way.

474
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,660
This whole case doesn't make any sense.

475
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,750
It doesn't.

476
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,670
No one believes me, but it doesn't.

477
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,290
I believe you.

478
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,860
I believe you and if you tell Voight what you just told me,

479
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,010
he's gonna believe you too.

480
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,600
Thank you.

481
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,610
I'm sorry, Kim.

482
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,530
I'm sorry.

483
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,670
I know that I was, um...

484
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,800
That Blair and I were sleeping together.

485
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,050
That I liked him a lot.

486
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm close to this.

487
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,890
I'm still rational, I'm still a cop,

488
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,200
and I know who he was and who he wasn't.

489
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,580
And he wasn't a drug dealer or a user.

490
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,440
Kim,

491
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,750
we don't have clean evidence any of this is linked to politics.

492
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,480
We do have evidence-- credible evidence--

493
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,750
that it's linked to drugs.

494
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,280
Then the evidence is lying.

495
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,510
The premise, Nate Lewis, something's wrong here.

496
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,200
I know that.

497
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,430
I want 48 hours before you charge Nate.

498
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,850
If I'm wrong about Blair, then I'm wrong,

499
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,460
but let me be sure of it.

501
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,630
I know what this case looks like,

502
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,840
but it's not about drugs.

503
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,220
Blair's vice was politics.

504
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,580
He won every campaign that he ever worked on

505
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,370
and he was gonna win this one too.

506
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,790
He played hard, probably dirty.

507
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,920
Now I'm thinking that the 20k that we found in his trunk

509
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,710
probably had to do with something political.

510
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,360
Yeah, so the question is,

511
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,960
what could Dennis know or have in his possession

512
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,460
that was worth 20k to Blair?

513
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,220
Probably something to do with Price.

514
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,090
Kim, I'm not trying to go against you here,

515
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,010
but we dug into Dennis.

516
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,390
We know he and Price knew each other.

517
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,890
but we didn't find any questionable

518
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,000
or illicit connections between them.

519
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,560
We ran Dennis through Kelton's background,

520
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,040
his campaign through Price's.

521
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,460
Nothing hit.

522
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,260
Jasmine Price.

523
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,150
What about his daughter, Jasmine?

524
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,970
Blair was looking into her. He did a full background check.

525
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,120
All right, Blair was digging into Jasmine.

526
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,020
Why don't we do some digging of our own?

527
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,940
See if there's anything real there.

528
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,790
Are you Vanessa? Can we talk to you for a sec?

529
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,940
- About what? - About Jasmine Price.

530
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,460
Is this about her father becoming mayor?

531
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,550
'Cause I never even met him.

532
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,860
We're not reporters. We're cops.

533
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,140
Sorry. Sure.

534
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,370
Yeah, we can talk.

535
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,660
- Can you cover me? - Yeah.

536
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,020
So you and Jasmine, you were roommates?

537
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,270
Yeah, for two years,

538
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,520
but we were never best friends or anything.

539
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,090
We ran in different crowds.

540
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,240
Just sort of stayed out of each other's way, you know?

541
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,740
Until she left school for a bit.

542
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,740
- Why? What's this about? - Why did she leave school?

543
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,780
I'm not really sure.

544
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,930
She just never came back after fall break.

545
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,680
She kind of just disappeared.

546
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,460
I said the same thing to that other guy about a week ago.

547
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,400
What other guy?

548
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,190
I'm sorry, I forgot his name.

549
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,460
What did he look like?

550
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,040
He was about your age.

551
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,920
Black, Asian. Dressed really nice.

552
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,240
- Blair. - Yeah, that's it. Blair.

553
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,840
He had a lot of questions about Jasmine too.

554
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,260
What kind of questions?

555
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,430
He wanted to know about some guy

556
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,390
she was dating from the city before she took a leave of absence.

557
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,020
I didn't remember his name.

558
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,600
I'd only met him a few times and he was kind of scary.

559
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,630
- A little wild and-- - This him?

560
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,250
Yeah, that's the guy.

561
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,670
Thank you.

562
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,430
I'll call Voight.

563
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,260
So I understand you knew Dennis Reed.

564
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,390
Yes, I knew Dennis.

565
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,750
We sort of hung out for a few months.

566
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,790
It's fair to say it wasn't Jasmine's finest hour.

567
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,750
- That's fair. - Okay.

568
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,130
We met at a party in the neighborhood

569
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,150
and we started dating.

570
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,900
And she started drinking

571
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,110
and partying, got lost.

572
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,470
So we pulled her out of school for a semester

573
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,200
so she could get her head on straight.

574
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,290
And now?

575
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,750
She's on track to graduate. With honors.

576
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,880
Just got accepted to Columbia Law School.

577
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,520
Good for you. That's a hell of a thing.

578
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,590
Thank you, sir.

579
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,220
Let me ask you,

580
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,680
when was the last time you talked to Dennis?

581
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,720
It's been a while.

582
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,520
- About a year? - Okay.

583
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,020
When you two were together, anything unusual happen?

584
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,190
Unusual?

585
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,090
Something you might not want the world to find out about.

586
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,050
Hank, what the hell kind of question is--

587
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,110
Ray, I'm trying to be respectful.

588
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,010
I got two dead bodies.

589
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:56,450
One of the dead guys was in your car the day before he died

590
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,120
and he dated your daughter.

591
00:27:58,930 --> 00:27:59,830
Okay.

592
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,040
Other than partying, no.

593
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,920
Nothing unusual or shameful.

594
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,510
Okay.

595
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,050
All right, then?

596
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,080
If you don't need anything else,

597
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,850
Jasmine needs to get back to work.

598
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,730
- Bye, baby. - See you, Daddy.

599
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,600
- Appreciate it. - Thank you.

600
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,500
Man, she seems like a good kid.

601
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,730
Yeah, she is. I'm very proud.

602
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,030
You should be.

603
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,070
Ray, why didn't you tell me Jasmine and Dennis had dated?

604
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:34,740
I was embarrassed.

605
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,220
I did everything I could to raise her right,

606
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,960
get her into a good college.

607
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,080
And then she starts dating some punk?

608
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,540
Made me crazy.

609
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,750
I tried to block it out.

610
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,420
Just pretend it didn't happen.

611
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,220
- We good, right? - Yeah.

612
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,350
Three more weeks, I'll be mayor.

613
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,900
Hell of a thing.

614
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,320
Me and you, we're gonna do some great things together.

615
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,390
- You talked to Jasmine? - I did.

616
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,720
She admit to dating Dennis?

617
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,660
Yeah, they dated a few months.

618
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,180
Partied more than they should have,

619
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,790
but according to her, that's about it.

620
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,740
So we still don't know

621
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,230
what Blair had on Jasmine or Ray that was so valuable.

622
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,190
If Blair found something,

623
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,360
he found it doing opposition research, right?

624
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,610
- Yeah. - Let's do the same.

625
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:35,490
Just focus on the two, three months Jasmine dated Dennis.

626
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,700
But listen, we soft-shoe this, okay.

627
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,810
Anybody asks, it's just for background.

628
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,100
None of this goes in the report yet.

629
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,560
Let's go.

630
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,250
Guys, September's a bust.

631
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,730
Let's move onto October.

632
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,790
October in a college town.

633
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,860
Gonna be a hell of a lot of police reports.

634
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,550
All right, Evanston, October 2016.

635
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:59,120
We got DUIs, disorderly conduct, drug possession.

636
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,060
Nothing connected to Jasmine or Dennis.

637
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,310
Well, maybe she got picked up, a cop knew who she was?

638
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,020
Well, if that's the case,

639
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,060
not a whole lot Blair can do without an official record.

640
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,310
She may have not been picked up, but she was partying.

641
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,810
She deleted her social media for all of October.

642
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,020
But her iCloud? Look at this.

643
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,280
She looks like a different person.

644
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,030
See, his iCloud, everything that doesn't match

645
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,950
his reverend rebrand got moved or deleted.

646
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,680
- Why not delete everything? - That I do not know.

647
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:23,410
Wait. Wait, who is that?

648
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,250
Do facial rec on her

649
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,100
- because I recognize her from these photos. - Sending.

650
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,320
Got it. Anna Welk.

651
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,150
One prior for possession,

652
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,380
deceased, October 17, 2016,

653
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,470
cocaine overdose.

654
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,300
Yeah, I got an EMT report.

655
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,220
Paramedics respond to a home in Evanston

656
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,560
on the morning of October 17th.

657
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,460
Patient Anna Welk pronounced dead on arrival.

658
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,230
I think I got something. I need a jump drive.

659
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,210
- We got to get this to Voight right away. - Here.

660
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,150
Jasmine Price, the badass bitch of Beverly.

661
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,760
Selling, taking names!

662
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,390
We gonna be rich! Cash money!

663
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,100
All I gotta do is keep selling to my girl, Anna.

664
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,940
Come here, babe. Come here.

665
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,690
Get over here.

666
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,440
Let me get some more vodka, boo.

667
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,240
- What the hell, Anna? - She down!

668
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,300
- Anna, stop playing! - No, no.

669
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,430
Stop playing. Anna!

670
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,080
- Don't--no! - Anna! Oh, my God!

671
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,600
Jasmine, call 911. Jazzy, call 911!

672
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,960
I need to call my dad!

673
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,670
- Anna... - I need to call my dad.

674
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,970
Listen.

675
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,930
I saw the video, Ray. It's bad.

676
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,790
Your daughter brags about selling cocaine to this girl

677
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,230
then she overdoses.

678
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,980
Then she calls you, instead of 911.

679
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,720
There's also no police report.

680
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,370
So I'm guessing you...

681
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,640
made the problem go away.

682
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,290
- She's my daughter. - Ray, what happened, Ray?

683
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,670
Blair found out about the video

684
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,280
or Dennis reach out to him first?

685
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,740
Tell him he had something of value?

686
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,110
Hank, it's not what you think.

687
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,140
Ray!

688
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,140
It's time to come clean right now.

689
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,790
I'm so tired of the lies,

690
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,320
the omissions.

691
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,570
Not knowing who you really are.

692
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,080
You're right.

693
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,710
The young man, Blair, called me.

694
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,170
Told me he knew about the video

695
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,260
and that he wanted me to step down,

696
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,060
to withdraw my candidacy.

697
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,810
And?

698
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,230
I told him to go to hell.

699
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,900
I... am not gonna walk away

700
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,540
just because some Ivy League pimp was extorting me.

701
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,570
Hell no!

702
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,610
So who did the murders?

703
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,740
I...

704
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,740
Who did the murders, Ray?

705
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,080
Ray, who--

706
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,960
Everything okay in here?

707
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,670
Hank and I are just, talking.

708
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:45,550
- It's best you leave us alone. - Yeah.

709
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,200
I said it's best if you--

710
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,010
No.

711
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,270
I don't want to leave you alone.

712
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,310
Not with him.

713
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,850
Not now.

714
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,830
Please, Alicia, just leave.

715
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,480
This smooth-talking prick was gonna ruin our lives.

716
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,760
Alicia, I think your husband's right.

717
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,050
It's better you stop talking.

718
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:08,780
He didn't care about us, our family,

719
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,310
all we had been through, all we were gonna do.

720
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,770
He was just trying to win some damn election.

721
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,520
Okay, Sergeant Voight doesn't want to hear--

722
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,900
I told him he was making a big mistake!

723
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,400
- Alicia, shut your damn mouth! - I--I will not!

724
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,150
- Just shut up! - I re--

725
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,550
Shut your mouth!

726
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,090
Please!

727
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,140
I did what I did.

728
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,850
I had no choice.

729
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,070
I couldn't let him, let them ruin our dreams.

730
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,190
Our family.

731
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,620
So I...

732
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,620
I killed Blair.

733
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,460
And then I killed Dennis.

734
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:18,770
Hank...

735
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,940
I don't know what to say.

736
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,280
- Yeah. - I don't know what to do.

737
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,860
She wasn't right.

738
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,450
She panicked.

739
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,080
You need to stop talking now.

740
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:35,660
Just...

741
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,580
Hank...

742
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,880
What's up? How did it go with Price?

743
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,590
What the hell was that?

744
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,950
I appreciate you meeting me on such short notice.

745
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,930
Sure thing.

746
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,890
Like I said on the phone, I'm here to help.

747
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,450
I got a confession

748
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,230
in the Blair Williams, Dennis Reed murder case.

749
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,570
Is it solid? Did you videotape it?

750
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,650
Got it in writing too

751
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,150
but it's off the record.

752
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,260
Unless we can negotiate a good deal,

753
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,030
it goes away like it never happened.

754
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,770
Go right back to the old evidence and facts we have

755
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,080
which are not perfect.

756
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,060
I think we both know a decent lawyer

757
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,960
could prove reasonable doubt.

758
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,710
Point taken.

759
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,320
So what's the ask?

760
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,760
Murder two, seven years.

761
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,340
Listen.

762
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,620
The offender was highly emotional.

763
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:38,910
Acted impulsively, irrationally.

764
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,160
The offender addresses all that in the video?

765
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,520
It's part of the proffer?

766
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,020
It's all laid out in detail.

767
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,360
And you think it's credible?

768
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,320
I do.

769
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,570
Let me watch the video. We'll go from there.

770
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,620
My name is Ray Price.

771
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,350
I'm talking to Sergeant Hank Voight

772
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,210
of the Chicago Police Department

773
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,880
about the murders of Blair Williams

774
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,210
and Dennis Reed.

775
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,110
When I learned that Blair Williams

776
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,950
was attempting to purchase a video

777
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:16,680
that would embarrass my family, my daughter,

778
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,310
and possibly ruin my chances of becoming mayor,

779
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,890
I tried to make a deal with him.

780
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,730
I tried to persuade him to bury the video.

781
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,480
We got into an argument,

782
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,570
began to fight,

783
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,450
and I ended up shooting him.

784
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,250
And then I shot Dennis Reed in a fit of rage,

785
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,160
panic.

786
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,500
When I'd come to my senses,

787
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,960
when I realized what I had done,

788
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,280
I planted evidence on a known drug dealer

789
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,260
by the name of Nate Lewis.

790
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,350
What I did was cowardly and unforgivable.

791
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,600
I'm deeply ashamed

792
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,310
and filled with regret and remorse.

793
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,570
But what I did,

794
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,320
I did for one simple reason.

795
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,120
I love my family.

797
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,890
They feel the same.

798
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,970
Drugs, politics.

799
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,770
Gone's just gone.

800
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,780
Ray Price, the candidate for mayor?

801
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,700
Yeah.

802
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,820
I'm afraid it's gonna be all over the news.

803
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,800
I think you and your family should brace yourself.

804
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,830
You're going to be asked for a lot of interviews

805
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,270
and, I mean, Chicago politics writ large.

806
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:09,170
Egos, back room deals.

807
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,960
- Right. - Okay.

808
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,880
We're gonna take him back home.

809
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,090
Have the funeral in Connecticut.

810
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,510
He'll be back with family at least.

811
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,510
Thank you for--

812
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,390
Thank you.

813
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,430
Maya?

814
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,570
Blair and I were dating.

815
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,250
I mean, we were just, like, at the beginning

816
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,200
but...

817
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,820
I think it could've been something truly amazing.

818
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,070
- It's not Special Reserve. - Yeah.

819
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,900
Not a headache in the bottle.

820
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,120
The ASA bit. You made the deal?

821
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,580
Seven years.

822
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,090
I was so close, Hank.

823
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,180
Really close.

824
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:54,230
Three weeks away from being the damn mayor of Chicago.

825
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,910
Yeah, it would have been a hell of a thing.
