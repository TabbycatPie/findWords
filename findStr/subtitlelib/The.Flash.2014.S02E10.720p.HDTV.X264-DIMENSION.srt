1
00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:02,899
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,553
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:09,772
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:12,840
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:16,411
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:18,312
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:21,684
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,686 --> 00:00:25,053
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,989
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,524
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,926
When my mother left
us, she was pregnant.

12
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:35,262
Dad, I'm so sorry that I
didn't tell you sooner.

13
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:38,000
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

14
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:40,002
You want Barry to get faster?

15
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:44,639
The more power he has,
the more I can take.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,673
Don't let him take me back there.

17
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,576
I won't.

18
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:49,243
You're going to help me

19
00:00:49,246 --> 00:00:52,581
in return for your daughter's life.

20
00:00:52,582 --> 00:00:55,482
I will help you steal The Flash's speed.

21
00:00:58,121 --> 00:00:59,822
I know I'm moving pretty fast,

22
00:00:59,823 --> 00:01:01,756
but stop me if you've
heard this one before.

23
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,025
Boy meets girl. Happens every day.

24
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:05,593
Except this boy was struck by lightning

25
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:07,695
and became the fastest man alive.

26
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:11,399
So nothing is ever that simple.

27
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:12,600
Oh, my...

28
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,703
Careful!

29
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:16,237
Oh, boy.
- Sorry!

30
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,474
It's all good.

31
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:21,643
Those weren't for me anyway, right?

32
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:22,978
They were.

33
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,579
I didn't realize roses
were so flammable.

34
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:26,281
Oh, my gosh.

35
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:28,316
Well, it's the... it's
the thought that counts.

36
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,019
And, you know, and proper
fire safety management,

37
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,686
that... that counts most.
- Yes.

38
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:36,258
I have spent most of my life

39
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,093
feeling very unlucky.

40
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:40,061
Yeah, and now?

41
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:42,668
Feels like I've been
struck by lightning twice.

42
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,378
Help!

43
00:01:57,414 --> 00:01:59,647
Help me...

44
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,409
Flash, everything you have

45
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:05,820
will be mine.

46
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:07,489
No!
- No!

47
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,092
No!

48
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,771
Okay, so there's my desk.

49
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:26,341
Upstairs is anti-crime
and the CSI lab...

50
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:27,542
that's where Barry works.

51
00:02:27,544 --> 00:02:30,278
And we have the open files...

52
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:31,780
And that is a pencil.

53
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:33,747
That: stapler.

54
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,783
Okay. Sorry, Wally.

55
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:37,686
Obviously, your sister
got the funny genes.

56
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:40,254
Captain. I want you to meet somebody.

57
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:41,856
This is my son Wally West.

58
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,390
Handsome young man, Joe.

59
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:45,093
Hey, he's a West. He can't help that.

60
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,995
Your pops here is a hell of a detective.

61
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:49,831
Obviously not.

62
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:52,901
Well, pleasure to meet you, Wally.

63
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:57,671
Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Wally.

64
00:02:57,674 --> 00:03:00,542
Yeah, I've always wanted a baby brother.

65
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:02,311
What about the White Shadow?

66
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:05,713
You're joking, but yeah,
we did call Barry that.

67
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:07,481
Well, he's been pretty busy.

68
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:09,217
He's doing a whole lot
of running around.

69
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:12,153
But why don't we do dinner?
The whole family.

70
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,955
I... I got plans.

71
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:15,289
Oh, Iris'll cook.

72
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:16,623
Dad, we just met the kid.

73
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:17,825
We don't want to kill him.

74
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:19,294
All right, we do takeout. Chinese.

75
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:20,562
Whatever. Come on.

76
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:22,697
Where are your cuffs, taillights?

77
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,199
Come on, let's go.

78
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,634
You know that kid?

79
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:28,436
No... no.

80
00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:30,472
You know, it's just what they say.

81
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:33,608
I got one of those faces.

82
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,843
I'll see you guys at dinner.

83
00:03:35,846 --> 00:03:37,211
Okay.

84
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,050
Any chance I could chat
with you for a minute?

85
00:03:42,051 --> 00:03:43,651
Yeah, what's up, Detective?

86
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:46,921
Oh... I-I meant Iris.

87
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:49,424
Yeah, you're not needed.

88
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:52,127
I am needed... somewhere.

89
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,495
I'ma... go there.

90
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:57,598
What can I do for you?

91
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:01,669
I just wanted to talk with you...

92
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,473
about Barry.

93
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:07,909
I know that Barry's...

94
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:09,676
you know, practically your brother.

95
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,478
So I understand that your loyalty

96
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,514
is obviously to him, not me.

97
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:16,684
But I was just hoping that maybe
you think I'm good for him,

98
00:04:16,685 --> 00:04:18,653
so you'd want to help me figure him out.

99
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:21,456
Well, I mean, if you did that, you...

100
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:22,957
you would be the first.

101
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,459
Wonderful. That gives me tons of hope.

102
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:28,997
It's just...

103
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:32,600
he's being not distant, but...

104
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,701
Guarded.

105
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,502
Yeah. He's being guarded.

106
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:37,771
And he's waking up from these bad dreams

107
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,374
and not telling me about them.

108
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,644
And I know that we got
close really quick.

109
00:04:42,646 --> 00:04:47,182
It's just... it's like there's
something holding him back.

110
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:49,483
Here's the thing about Barry.

111
00:04:49,485 --> 00:04:52,254
He has a bad habit of

112
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,990
carrying the weight of the
world on his shoulders,

113
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,558
burdens that aren't even his to bear.

114
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,261
But he doesn't have to do that with me.

115
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:01,593
Which is exactly what
you should tell him.

116
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,981
Hey... no! Absolutely not!

117
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:21,682
You don't get to throw
somebody else's stuff

118
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:23,485
when you're pissed off.

119
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:27,555
Thank you.

120
00:05:33,062 --> 00:05:35,562
What is this?

121
00:05:35,564 --> 00:05:38,533
Wrong answers.

122
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:40,235
Maybe you're asking the wrong questions.

123
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:41,935
What does that mean?

124
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:44,172
I've been thinking about
this a lot recently.

125
00:05:44,173 --> 00:05:46,774
We keep trying to come up with
ways to make Barry faster,

126
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:49,911
but I still think we can figure
out a way to make Zoom slower.

127
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,379
We tried that already, remember?

128
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:53,048
Those darts didn't slow him down at all.

129
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,781
Yeah, I know... I'm not talking
about the darts, okay?

130
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:57,084
The darts clearly didn't work.
They just pissed him off.

131
00:05:57,086 --> 00:05:59,053
I'm talking about something else...

132
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:00,922
a way we can steal Zoom's speed.

133
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:07,829
How?

134
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,596
The Turtle.

135
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,033
As some of you may well know,

136
00:06:12,036 --> 00:06:15,269
I've been deeply embroiled in
a secret, one-sided battle

137
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,437
with an invisible enemy.

138
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,872
No, not the Turtle again.

139
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:19,807
What? What is the...

140
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,910
Or who is the Turtle?
- It's Cisco's white whale.

141
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,077
Half whale, half turtle.

142
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,413
No.

143
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:25,579
Do you see what you're doing, Caitlin?

144
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:26,581
Everybody's confused now.

145
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:27,882
Get to it.

146
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,451
I stumbled upon a few of these cases

147
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:31,185
when we were looking
for the Reverse Flash,

148
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:33,487
robberies that were seemingly
committed at high speed...

149
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,856
people holding their
beloved items one second.

150
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,725
Those items were gone the next.

151
00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:38,927
Tell me what you see.

152
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:46,668
So he can... what? Stop time?

153
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,502
No, no, no. Look at the time code.

154
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:51,738
It's still running.

155
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,608
Yeah, okay. So if he's
not stopping time,

156
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,076
what is he doing?

157
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:58,045
He's slowing down everything around him.

158
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:01,283
And that is why we call him the Turtle.

159
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,517
Why have you never mentioned
this guy to me before?

160
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,086
Oh, I don't know, I
think we've just been

161
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:07,021
a little distracted, you
know, what with Captain Cold

162
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:08,490
and the Weather Wizard
and Gorilla Grodd.

163
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,690
Do I need to go on?

164
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:10,992
Okay, so if we can catch him,

165
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:12,759
figure out how he uses his powers...

166
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:15,596
Maybe we can show Zoom what
life is like in the slow lane.

167
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,231
How would you even know
where to find him?

168
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,699
Well, the robberies in the videos

169
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:20,268
all correspond with police reports

170
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:22,437
that were dismissed as
lost or missing items

171
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,605
instead of thefts.

172
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:24,771
The suspect's M.O. being...

173
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:26,975
Items of immense personal value.

174
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:30,417
PRESS RELEASE

175
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,752
It appears that there's a
press conference at CCPD,

176
00:07:38,754 --> 00:07:41,555
because the Vandervoort diamonds
have just been recovered.

177
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:46,961
"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee."

178
00:07:46,963 --> 00:07:49,331
The perpetrators who committed
this heartless crime

179
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:51,733
have been apprehended and
are now in our custody.

180
00:07:51,735 --> 00:07:54,201
And we're happy to report that
the famed Vandervoort diamonds

181
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:56,103
have been returned to
their rightful owner.

182
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:59,574
The real gem is the return of
my great-grandfather's ring.

183
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,242
Getting that returned to the family

184
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:03,011
is what's most priceless to me.

185
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:04,745
Gotcha.

186
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:32,974
The ring is gone. What happened to it?

187
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:35,376
Lock this place down. No
one leaves this room.

188
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,644
Sweep the precinct!

189
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,028
Well, the good new is
whatever the Turtle did,

190
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:45,940
it only affected you temporarily.

191
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:47,398
Yo.

192
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,232
What was it like being in Turtle Time?

193
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:50,366
Yeah, no, it was weird.

194
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,403
It was like waves of inertness...

195
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:54,138
like all the energy was
suddenly sucked out of my body,

196
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,940
and then it would return.

197
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,673
That's because that's
exactly what was happening.

198
00:08:57,676 --> 00:08:59,176
He has the ability to transfer

199
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:01,110
all the surrounding kinetic
energy into himself.

200
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:02,678
Leaving everyone else
in a temporary state

201
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:03,679
of potential energy.

202
00:09:03,682 --> 00:09:05,481
That's right.

203
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:06,817
So why could I still move?

204
00:09:06,818 --> 00:09:08,217
Your speed.

205
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,719
Your speed allows you
to change positions

206
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:11,221
faster than anyone else.

207
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:13,190
So you can convert your
stored potential energy

208
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:14,357
back to kinetic energy.

209
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,658
Excuse me, where are you going?

210
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,893
Trying to figure out

211
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:18,861
how to use this against Zoom.

212
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:21,498
You remember Zoom?

213
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,267
"Cisco, please join me.

214
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,003
"We'll use your idea and take
it to new scientific heights

215
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,136
and save the world."

216
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:28,972
Yes, I'd love to!

217
00:09:28,975 --> 00:09:30,907
Okay.

218
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:33,143
Facial recognition
software found us a match

219
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:35,044
from the press conference footage.

220
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:38,115
The Turtle's name is Russell Glosson.

221
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:40,884
He was a small-time thief
who stopped thieving

222
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,786
after the particle
accelerator explosion.

223
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:44,288
All right, I'm gonna head to work...

224
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:45,621
catch Joe up.

225
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:47,524
Let me know if you find anything else.

226
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:53,830
You okay?

227
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,399
Yeah, yeah, it's just...

228
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,701
It's hard to... look at that

229
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:01,205
and not think about how I
can't help people anymore.

230
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:04,673
Well, we have lots of technology here.

231
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:07,878
Why don't we figure out how
to get your speed back?

232
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:10,080
I'm a scientist too, Caitlin.

233
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:11,481
When I first got here,

234
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:14,317
all I did was work on how
to get my speed back.

235
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,355
Believe me, whatever
test you could run...

236
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,655
I've already done it.

237
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:28,065
The Turtle.

238
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:30,799
Cisco's been looking
for this guy forever.

239
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:32,536
Singh just put an APB out on him.

240
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,239
How did everybody know about
Glosson before I did?

241
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:39,009
Cisco's got a whole list
of unidentified metas.

242
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,443
The boys around here are calling him

243
00:10:40,446 --> 00:10:41,778
Cisco de la Mancha.

244
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,950
Are you good? You seem a
little atle jittery.

245
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,918
A little anxious.

246
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:50,553
Let's be honest.

247
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:52,755
I'm really nervous about
this whole dinner tonight

248
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:54,024
with Wally.

249
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:55,625
Come on, why... why are you nervous?

250
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:57,494
You're, like, the best dad ever.

251
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:59,229
He'll see that.

252
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,498
It'll be a whole lot
easier, you being there.

253
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,399
Joe, I wouldn't miss it.

254
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:07,003
See you tonight.
- All right.

255
00:11:09,774 --> 00:11:11,107
Hey, you.

256
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,609
Hey.
- You got a sec?

257
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,077
Yeah.

258
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,578
I just...

259
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:18,248
I just want to make
sure everything's okay.

260
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,416
Yeah.

261
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:20,951
Yeah, I'm... I'm... I...

262
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:22,219
don't want to nag.

263
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,419
That's not, you know, who I am.

264
00:11:23,422 --> 00:11:25,489
I just...

265
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,825
I don't... I don't want you
to feel burdened by anything.

266
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,126
No, I don't.

267
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,328
Okay.

268
00:11:32,331 --> 00:11:35,698
Hey, wait. Patty...

269
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:37,600
The New Years was always
a hard time for me.

270
00:11:37,602 --> 00:11:40,437
That's when my mom died, so
it's just those memories

271
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,004
all come out, and they're
hard to put away.

272
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:43,440
So if it feels like I haven't
been communicating...

273
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:44,673
I'm sorry, Barry. I'm sorry.

274
00:11:44,676 --> 00:11:45,709
I-I didn't know.

275
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:48,111
No, no, no, no, no.

276
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:53,783
Look... we haven't had a
romantic night in a while.

277
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:57,052
What do you say tomorrow night
we get some dinner and drinks

278
00:11:57,054 --> 00:11:59,523
and maybe a little... kissing?

279
00:11:59,524 --> 00:12:01,158
That sounds like what we need.

280
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,126
Okay. All right, I'll see you later.

281
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,995
Okay.

282
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:12,402
Okay, I think we can call it.

283
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:14,671
Wally is not coming.

284
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:15,839
I'm sorry, Joe.

285
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:17,541
I know how much this meant to you.

286
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:22,879
He's a kid, right? I get it.

287
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,313
He could have at least called.

288
00:12:24,316 --> 00:12:25,881
Well, there could be a number of reasons

289
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:28,051
why he didn't.

290
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:30,386
Thank you for being here.

291
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,221
I love you.

292
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,224
Love you.

293
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:37,226
See you in the morning, Bar.

294
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:38,662
Yeah.

295
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:48,138
Well, West family 2.0 is not
really off to a great start.

296
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:50,706
You've been quiet all evening.

297
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:54,211
The Turtle?

298
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:55,546
How do you know about him?

299
00:12:57,572 --> 00:12:59,749
No...

300
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,619
No, I've just had a lot on my mind.

301
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,821
Patty?

302
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:08,392
We... we may have met for coffee.

303
00:13:08,394 --> 00:13:09,625
Iris...

304
00:13:09,628 --> 00:13:11,461
She really cares about you, Barry,

305
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:14,697
and she's just wondering why
you've been so guarded.

306
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,131
And what did you tell her?

307
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:18,768
I told her to talk to you.

308
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,937
Oh, that's not cool.

309
00:13:20,938 --> 00:13:24,039
You know, she did mention that...

310
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:27,277
you've been having nightmares.

311
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,779
About Zoom...

312
00:13:30,782 --> 00:13:33,616
killing her.

313
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:34,918
Look.

314
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,852
I know that things have

315
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:39,255
been moving pretty fast

316
00:13:39,258 --> 00:13:41,557
between you two.

317
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,028
But you realize you can't keep
things from her forever, right?

318
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:48,097
One day, you're gonna have
to tell her the truth.

319
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,433
That I'm the Flash?

320
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:52,536
I can't do that.

321
00:13:52,538 --> 00:13:56,440
Barry, I wish a year ago
you had told me the truth.

322
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:58,475
So, what, you think that
I should just tell her?

323
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:01,644
I think that if you are serious

324
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:05,042
about being with her,

325
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:06,048
you have to.

326
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,323
All right, then that's
what I'm gonna do.

327
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,926
I'll tell Patty I'm the Flash.

328
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,807
Hey.

329
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:29,041
You guys got anything?

330
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:30,876
I think we found the next target

331
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,080
for our 30-something,
meta-human, not-a-Ninja-Turtle.

332
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,115
How long did it take you
to come up with that one?

333
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,984
It just came out of my mouth...
did you see that?

334
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:39,251
That was amazing.
- That was nice.

335
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,653
Central City Museum

336
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:42,020
is hosting a special
black tie event tonight

337
00:14:42,023 --> 00:14:44,289
showcasing "The Crystal Ball."

338
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:46,158
It's a famous painting, apparently,

339
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:47,994
recently recovered from Markovia.

340
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:49,595
The painting is on loan to the museum

341
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:50,897
from the Silverberg family.

342
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:52,597
Jacob Silverberg himself said,

343
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,334
"The painting's safe
return means more to us

344
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,135
than all the money in the world "

345
00:14:57,138 --> 00:14:59,038
It's like they're begging
Turtle to rob it.

346
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,307
Okay, yes. This is a plan.

347
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:04,309
So the Turtle will make his move,

348
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:07,546
and we can be there
waiting to take him down.

349
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,414
How do you look in a tux?

350
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:11,383
Come on, he's 6'2", he's square-jawed,

351
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:12,350
and he's jacked.

352
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:13,485
I think he looks fine.

353
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:14,620
I'm 6'4".

354
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:15,955
Oh, crap!

355
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,722
Problem?

356
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:21,759
No.

357
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:24,163
An opportunity, maybe. Hold on.

358
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:28,967
Hey, you.

359
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,136
I'm excited to see you tonight.
- Yeah, me too.

360
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,039
Actually, about that... so I know I said

361
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,975
"let's have dinner", but...

362
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,509
you've been wanting me to share more.

363
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,879
So I thought that I would share that

364
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,648
I love art.

365
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,649
Okay, interesting.
- Yeah.

366
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,719
No, I just, you know, I
can't get enough of art.

367
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:48,586
Anyway, there's this event

368
00:15:48,588 --> 00:15:50,688
at the Central City Museum tonight.

369
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:52,524
They're showing this
really famous painting

370
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:54,025
that I've always loved.

371
00:15:54,028 --> 00:15:57,629
Actually, I don't know
anything about art,

372
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,764
but what's the saying?

373
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,399
I know what I like,

374
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,799
and I like you,

375
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:03,235
so count me in.

376
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:05,537
All right, great. I'll see you at 8:00.

377
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:07,072
7:00!
- Or 7:00.

378
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:09,841
I'll see you at 7:00.
- Okay, 7:00 it is.

379
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,409
Bye.

380
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,278
You know, you're a really
great superhero...

381
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,746
Thanks.
- A really great superhero...

382
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:16,615
Thank you.
- But do you think

383
00:16:16,616 --> 00:16:18,384
it's a good idea when
you're fighting crime

384
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:19,918
to bring a date?

385
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:22,376
I'm gonna tell Patty...

386
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:23,879
that I'm the Flash.

387
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:27,158
Is that a bad idea? What do we think?

388
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:31,062
I will say, she put bullets
in King Shark and Harry.

389
00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:32,431
Yeah.
- So as far as I'm concerned,

390
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:33,698
that's Team Flash material to me.

391
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,768
All right, yes. Thank you, Cisco.

392
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,802
Yeah, thank you. Cool.

393
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:39,404
I'm gonna do this...

394
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,206
I'm gonna tell her.

395
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:46,412
Don't tell her.

396
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,253
You care for this woman.

397
00:16:54,254 --> 00:16:55,721
That's nice.

398
00:16:55,722 --> 00:16:58,724
Then keep her as far away
from this as possible.

399
00:16:58,725 --> 00:17:00,225
And here's why.

400
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:03,929
If Zoom finds out who you care for,

401
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:05,897
who you love,

402
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,366
who you live for,

403
00:17:08,368 --> 00:17:10,036
he'll take them from you.

404
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:22,780
JOHN WILLIAM - WATERHOUSE EXHIBIT

405
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:32,691
All right.

406
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:34,926
Keep your eyes open for the Turtle.

407
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,862
A sentence I never thought I would say.

408
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:52,877
Cisco, are you and Harry in position?

409
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,512
I'm the security feed.

410
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:56,281
I've got the facial
recognition software running,

411
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,549
so we'll be able to spot Turtle
before he makes his move.

412
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:00,486
Turtle.

413
00:18:00,488 --> 00:18:02,320
Why do you insist on giving them

414
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:03,788
ridiculous nicknames?

415
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,324
Me?

416
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:08,461
Who's the genius that
came up with "Zoom"?

417
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,365
Yeah, well...

418
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:20,306
I'll tell you, about two years ago...

419
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,974
this is on Earth-2, now.

420
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,510
The CCPD there...

421
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:28,180
they got a 911 call

422
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:30,316
about a hostage situation,

423
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,984
but when the SWAT team got there,

424
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,121
there were no hostages.

425
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,288
It was a trap.

426
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,057
Zoom set a trap

427
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:43,761
in order to show the police
that they could not stop him.

428
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:47,732
And he killed 14 officers.

429
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:51,069
Men and women. Slaughtered them.

430
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:55,207
Left one alive to tell what happened.

431
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:58,376
That officer described

432
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,578
blue lightning

433
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,780
"zooming" all about

434
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:06,984
as his comrades, brothers
and sisters in arms,

435
00:19:06,987 --> 00:19:09,320
were murdered.

436
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:12,223
That officer...

437
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:14,893
considered himself to be a lucky one,

438
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,496
spared in order to tell the tale.

439
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:23,669
Until Zoom went to his house
that night and killed him too.

440
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:28,240
Anyway, that's how he got
the nickname "Zoom"

441
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:39,250
If you ever need me to Vibe...

442
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:40,751
so you can know if she's still alive...

443
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:44,390
She's alive.

444
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,491
Right.

445
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,201
No!

446
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,373
You have a really weird
look on your face.

447
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,909
Do I look weird?
- No, no.

448
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,579
You... look... like a dream.

449
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,981
You look very handsome.

450
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:13,884
I can't wait to see this painting.

451
00:20:13,886 --> 00:20:15,221
What painting?

452
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:16,721
The painting. Yeah.

453
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:19,491
Me too... yeah.

454
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:22,994
How about we talk first?

455
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:24,630
I thought you'd never ask.

456
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:32,069
I can't figure you out, Barry Allen.

457
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:34,640
That is because I work hard

458
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,807
to hide who I really am.

459
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:39,978
You don't have to hide with me.

460
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,779
I just have to

461
00:20:41,781 --> 00:20:44,750
really trust someone

462
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:48,287
if they're gonna know the truth.

463
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,587
Do you?

464
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,692
I trust you, Patty.

465
00:20:55,496 --> 00:20:58,829
I trust you, too.

466
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:01,098
Patty...

467
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:06,438
After I was struck by lightning,

468
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,041
when I woke up...

469
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,680
We've got eyes on Turtle.

470
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:20,553
Barry, you were saying?

471
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,221
I have to go. I'm sorry.

472
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:23,888
What? What?

473
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,324
But Barry...

474
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:29,728
CCPD! Freeze!

475
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,335
What?

476
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:43,974
Are you as fast as the Flash?

477
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:46,679
Oh, no. He is much slower.

478
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:49,847
This is a trap?

479
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,349
I'm slow...

480
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,050
not stupid.

481
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:26,618
Oh, my God!

482
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:30,722
I got it. Come on.

483
00:22:48,093 --> 00:22:49,893
Your pupils are normal.

484
00:22:49,894 --> 00:22:51,461
Your heart rate's a little low.

485
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:53,730
But other than that, no
concussive symptoms.

486
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,898
I really do feel fine.
What about Turtle?

487
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:58,368
No sign of him.
- Or the painting.

488
00:22:58,371 --> 00:23:01,070
He... must have gotten
away with it in the chaos.

489
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:02,630
Yeah, things went a little sideways

490
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,740
after your girlfriend decided

491
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:05,976
to go all "Lethal Weapon"
1 through 4 on Turtle.

492
00:23:05,978 --> 00:23:07,310
Oh, my God.

493
00:23:07,313 --> 00:23:08,944
Patty's gonna think I ditched her.

494
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:10,780
I... no, I got to go.

495
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:12,282
Where are you...

496
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:14,317
finding Turtle is what's
important right now.

497
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,819
Yeah... this is important to me too.

498
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:19,455
But we need to see if
your speed still works.

499
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,157
I think... I think it still works.

500
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,394
We still have to find out how
Turtle drained him of it.

501
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,065
Can I talk to you...

502
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:30,500
for a second?

503
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:42,045
You never got your champagne.

504
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,079
I couldn't find any flutes.

505
00:23:44,082 --> 00:23:45,882
Hope that's okay.

506
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:47,183
Of course.

507
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:48,551
Here you go.

508
00:24:01,098 --> 00:24:03,634
Let me go see if I can
make myself useful.

509
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:18,798
SUBS FROM TUSUBTITULO

510
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,141
MIDWAY CITY UNIVERSITY
DEPARTMENT OF FORENSIC SCIENCES

511
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:43,807
I was right.

512
00:24:43,808 --> 00:24:47,243
I thought that you would
look mad, and you do.

513
00:24:47,246 --> 00:24:50,247
What happened?

514
00:24:53,486 --> 00:24:56,118
I don't really have a good excuse.

515
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,387
Nothing?

516
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,122
Nothing? I mean, come on, Barry.

517
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:01,991
Anything is better than nothing.

518
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:03,626
I mean, come on.

519
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:06,296
Holy crap, I've been a really,
really cool girlfriend.

520
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:08,298
Most girls don't have the self-esteem

521
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:10,401
to handle the... plans?

522
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:12,335
Oh, no plans. That's cool.

523
00:25:12,336 --> 00:25:13,871
Or the... or the...

524
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:16,707
waking up in the middle of
the night screaming again.

525
00:25:16,709 --> 00:25:18,442
Fine, whatever.

526
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:21,076
And then... and then the
really, really fancy plans...

527
00:25:21,078 --> 00:25:22,512
which were awesome.

528
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:25,915
And then you ditched me
right before I almost died.

529
00:25:25,917 --> 00:25:28,684
I mean, when you put it that way, it...

530
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:31,587
I'm actually really upset.

531
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,222
Yeah, I know.

532
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:35,191
Look, we've been having fun.

533
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:37,461
And fun has been so great.

534
00:25:37,462 --> 00:25:40,297
But... I'm moving past fun

535
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:42,365
to the close part.

536
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,401
That's what I want, okay?

537
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:46,135
That's where I'm going.

538
00:25:46,137 --> 00:25:48,872
You need to figure out
what it is that you want.

539
00:25:48,874 --> 00:25:51,642
And do it fast.

540
00:25:56,248 --> 00:25:58,582
Fast is my specialty.

541
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:05,382
Yo, pay up.

542
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:24,768
What?

543
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,836
You got someone tailing me now?

544
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,806
Why didn't you show up
for dinner last night?

545
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:31,441
Couldn't make it.

546
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:34,176
You tell someone you're
gonna be somewhere,

547
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:36,445
you show up.

548
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:40,482
Guess I didn't have my
dad to teach me that?

549
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:43,252
Is this why you came to Central City?

550
00:27:43,255 --> 00:27:45,320
Not to get to know me or your sister,

551
00:27:45,323 --> 00:27:47,457
but this nonsense?

552
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:50,027
No one in Keystone will race me anymore.

553
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:52,962
But I don't actually have
to explain myself to you.

554
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:55,031
Actually, you do.

555
00:27:55,034 --> 00:27:57,400
This is illegal. I'm a cop, remember?

556
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:58,969
Oh, yeah. Yes.

557
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,237
The detective who didn't
know he had a son

558
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:03,440
and who doesn't know anything about me.

559
00:28:03,442 --> 00:28:06,777
I am trying to get to know you, Wally.

560
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:08,344
These races... that car...

561
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:11,582
that I won?

562
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:14,150
That's the only way that I can
pay for my mom's hospital bills,

563
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,986
get her the help that she needs.

564
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,854
You don't have to do this.

565
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:19,990
I have money saved. I can
dip into my pension.

566
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:21,423
I don't need your money.

567
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:25,260
I can take care of
myself and my mom, okay?

568
00:28:25,262 --> 00:28:28,330
I'm the man of our house. That
position has been filled.

569
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:34,704
Go home to your family, Joe.

570
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,684
Barry?

571
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:49,885
Hey...

572
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,839
What?

573
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:14,443
What do you want from me?

574
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:17,313
The thing most precious to the Flash...

575
00:29:17,315 --> 00:29:18,981
you.

576
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:29,755
Patty?

577
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:43,434
No, no, no, no, no.

578
00:29:43,436 --> 00:29:45,471
No.

579
00:29:45,472 --> 00:29:48,374
Come on.

580
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:51,344
No... Joe!

581
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:54,079
Joe... I think the Turtle has Patty.

582
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:57,950
I... Look, just meet me at S.T.A.R.
Labs, all right?

583
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:23,741
What do you want from me?

584
00:30:23,743 --> 00:30:25,676
I want you to stop moving...

585
00:30:27,515 --> 00:30:28,914
Forever.

586
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,415
What do you get out of killing me?

587
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,317
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.

588
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,954
That's much too... fast and messy.

589
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:39,191
I like to take things nice and slow.

590
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:41,359
You don't have to hurt me
to try to prove a point.

591
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:44,163
This isn't about hurting you.

592
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:47,699
This is about hurting
someone who values you.

593
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:50,336
Who, Barry?

594
00:30:50,337 --> 00:30:52,337
No.

595
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:53,739
The Flash.

596
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,673
What does he have to do with this?

597
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,680
I saw the way he saved you.

598
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:03,714
Yes, that's what he does.

599
00:31:03,717 --> 00:31:04,782
He's a hero.

600
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:06,852
He saves people who need saving.

601
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:09,288
That's a waste of time...

602
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:10,455
saving people.

603
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:16,429
They take everything for granted.

604
00:31:16,431 --> 00:31:19,965
So you take the things
that matter most to them.

605
00:31:19,968 --> 00:31:23,836
My wife Rosalyn took me for granted.

606
00:31:23,837 --> 00:31:25,971
She wanted to leave me...

607
00:31:25,973 --> 00:31:27,405
the thing I valued most.

608
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:29,407
So that's what this is about?

609
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,943
You're hurt because your wife left you?

610
00:31:33,913 --> 00:31:35,913
I couldn't let that happen.

611
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:40,118
So I made her mine.

612
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:43,788
Forever.

613
00:32:10,884 --> 00:32:13,152
I do hope I spelled your name right.
- DETECTIVE PATTY SPIVOT

614
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,522
Bar... we'll find her.

615
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:19,191
I'm not getting any leads on this guy.

616
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:20,893
It's like he's totally
fallen off the grid.

617
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:23,028
You know, it... any of
the stuff he's stolen,

618
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,530
I can't find it.
- He keeps them.

619
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:28,299
He keeps them the way a serial
killer collects trophies.

620
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,867
He's stolen a lot of stuff.

621
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:32,471
Which means he needs a lot
of space to store it, right?

622
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:33,605
That's where we start.

623
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:36,008
See if he rented any storage spaces.

624
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:38,144
No, no...

625
00:32:38,145 --> 00:32:40,179
I'm not getting anything.

626
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:41,747
Wait a minute.

627
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:45,151
His ex-wife used to be an
archivist for antiquities

628
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:47,853
at the Naydel Library
before it shut down,

629
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:50,423
and it shut down three months
after the accelerator exploded.

630
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,424
That place is big enough
to hold Turtle's stuff.

631
00:32:52,426 --> 00:32:53,892
Okay, all right.

632
00:32:53,894 --> 00:32:55,294
Wait, Barry... we haven't
even figured out

633
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,028
how to neutralize the Turtle's power.

634
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,164
Well, I'm gonna have
to power through it.

635
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:06,105
All right, I'm outside the library.

636
00:33:06,106 --> 00:33:08,006
Barry, the only way to save Patty

637
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:10,108
is if you grab her in between
each of the Turtle's pulses.

638
00:33:10,111 --> 00:33:11,977
You'll only have 2/10ths of a second

639
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:12,978
to make your moves.

640
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,446
I got it.

641
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,354
No!

642
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:04,695
I guess he doesn't care about you

643
00:34:04,698 --> 00:34:07,633
as much as I thought.

644
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:09,101
No...

645
00:34:13,608 --> 00:34:15,474
No, no... please!

646
00:34:55,748 --> 00:34:57,449
No, it's all right.

647
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:03,289
Thank you. Thank you.

648
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,291
Thank you, whoever you are.

649
00:35:07,394 --> 00:35:11,362
It's okay.

650
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,385
Hey, Turtle.

651
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:29,090
So you want to know my
new definition of irony?

652
00:35:29,092 --> 00:35:32,594
Now you... are our most
prized possession.

653
00:35:39,469 --> 00:35:42,170
Patty okay?
- She is, yeah.

654
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:55,717
Jay?

655
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,719
Yeah?

656
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,724
I know.

657
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,192
Why didn't you tell me that you're sick?

658
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,362
The champagne.

659
00:36:08,364 --> 00:36:10,599
You took my DNA off the glass.

660
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,534
You know I lost my husband...

661
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:15,704
how hard that was for me to move on.

662
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,239
How could you let me get close to you

663
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,875
knowing that soon I'd lose you too?

664
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,545
I just...

665
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:25,112
I didn't expect...

666
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:27,782
this.

667
00:36:27,784 --> 00:36:28,918
I didn't expect you.

668
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,454
Then help me find a cure.

669
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,422
There is no cure.

670
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,092
The only way to save me
is to get my speed back.

671
00:36:38,094 --> 00:36:41,664
And the only way to do
that is to stop Zoom.

672
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,465
Then let's stop him.

673
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,869
Yeah.

674
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,581
Hey.

675
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,916
I think I left my sweater
here the other night.

676
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,717
It's green.

677
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,853
Oh, yeah.

678
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:07,355
I thought that didn't look like Barry's.

679
00:37:12,362 --> 00:37:14,630
Heading back to Keystone tonight.

680
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,965
That's a fast trip.

681
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,833
Yeah, well, it's getting a little hot

682
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:18,867
in Central City for me.

683
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,434
Don't worry.

684
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:23,371
I'll try not to run too many
lights on the way there.

685
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:30,679
You know, if you're
waiting for an apology,

686
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:31,813
it's not coming.

687
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:33,983
No.

688
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,117
No, I'm... I'm the one that should be

689
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:38,853
apologizing to you.

690
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,389
I felt bad

691
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:44,893
not being there while you
were growing up, and...

692
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:48,295
I was pushing this whole
father-son thing.

693
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:50,364
I'm sorry.

694
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:52,501
Let's just slow down a bit.

695
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,302
I won't try to be your instant dad,

696
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,137
and you won't have to pretend that

697
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:58,039
you want to be my son.

698
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:03,746
Deal?

699
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,213
All that food for you?

700
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:07,815
Doesn't have to be.

701
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,885
You like chow mein?

702
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,253
No.

703
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,923
But I like kung pao chicken.

704
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:29,336
Initial and sign.

705
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:31,572
There you go. Thank you, guys.

706
00:38:31,574 --> 00:38:32,974
Patty.

707
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,376
Hey.
- Hi.

708
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:36,945
Can we talk... like, really talk?

709
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:38,512
Yeah... no.

710
00:38:38,514 --> 00:38:40,181
Now's not really an awesome time.

711
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,916
I have a mound of paperwork
on my desk I need to finish,

712
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,152
so I'm sorry, I can't.

713
00:38:43,153 --> 00:38:44,619
No, no, okay. Real... really quick.

714
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,688
So you were right.

715
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,923
You were right about everything.

716
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:50,726
I've been closed off and weird,

717
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,695
and, um, all the things
that you said I was.

718
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:57,632
But mostly, I have not been honest.

719
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:00,601
Barry...

720
00:39:00,603 --> 00:39:02,304
I'm leaving Central City.

721
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,309
What?

722
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:11,646
Before Mardon, and before my dad...

723
00:39:11,648 --> 00:39:13,347
before everything...

724
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:16,284
I always wanted to be a CSI.

725
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:17,920
And four years ago, I was accepted

726
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,253
into the Forensic Science program

727
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:22,891
at Midway City University.

728
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:24,626
That's a really great school.

729
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:25,693
Yeah.

730
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:27,762
Yeah, I know, I just...

731
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:29,130
I didn't go.

732
00:39:29,132 --> 00:39:31,699
You know, I deferred
to become a cop and...

733
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,702
catch my dad's killer.

734
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:37,505
And I've done that.

735
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:40,141
So...

736
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:43,277
so it's time to move on.

737
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,313
From the job?

738
00:39:47,717 --> 00:39:49,684
From everything.

739
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,590
Patty. Patty...

740
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:56,992
Pat...

741
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,670
Journal log entry number 113.

742
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,675
Jess...

743
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:17,980
I'm coming for you soon.

744
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,081
I promise.

745
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:22,251
I was thinking earlier
today about the time

746
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,219
that you were four.

747
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,688
I took you to the
planetarium, just you and me.

748
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,422
I remember because it was the first time

749
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:30,425
I took you out all by myself.

750
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:32,360
The planetarium was crowded,

751
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:35,063
and you held my hand for dear life,

752
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,266
or maybe it was the other way around.

753
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,001
But it was in the Mars
exhibit that I lost you.

754
00:40:40,003 --> 00:40:41,503
Panic.

755
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,271
I had that place locked
down in one minute.

756
00:40:43,273 --> 00:40:45,206
I had every security
guard looking for you.

757
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,242
And I could feel the fear
rise in the back of my throat

758
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:50,945
and something else rising also,

759
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:55,818
some... dark instinct inside me

760
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,686
about what I would do

761
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:00,989
to the person who had taken you...

762
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,090
the things I would do...

763
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:07,394
Unspeakable things.

764
00:41:07,396 --> 00:41:11,565
And it was in that
moment that I realized,

765
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:13,202
for certain,

766
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:18,873
that I would do anything
to get you back.

767
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:52,639
Gideon.
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

768
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,110
Where the hell am I?
