1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,600
Every single one of us at Renault,
our focus is on the stability of the team.

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,960
Pure focus on this season's performance.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>Oh, what's happened
to the Renault here of Daniel Ricciardo?</i>

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,240
<i>Is he stuck in third gear?</i>

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,320
What a mess.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,680
<i>Daniel Ricciardo, out of the race.</i>

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,280
Shit.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,840
We need to be in a position to fight
for podiums and then fight for wins

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,680
and then fight for championships.

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,560
But Daniel has put a stop to all of that.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,840
<i>The big news of the week</i>

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,680
<i>is that Daniel Ricciardo
is on his way to McLaren.</i>

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,040
<i>What do you make of that?</i>

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,360
I've done my best in not being hurt,
in not making it personal,

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,040
Daniel leaving me.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,440
- Hey, dude.
- Hey.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,280
<i>Ricciardo's on a monster salary,</i>

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,800
<i>so from Renault's point of view,
they're sort of thinking,</i>

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,120
<i>"Come on, we've given you
everything you've asked for and more,</i>

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,920
<i>and you've not actually given us a chance</i>

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,680
<i>to prove we're on a better trajectory
than McLaren."</i>

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,120
What's been,
I guess, hurting the most,

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,960
is the fact
that it's not the long-term project

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,080
that I thought we had signed up for.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,400
Why McLaren, do you think?

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,160
Ask him.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
Ask him. Ask him.

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,920
- All right, let's go.
- Let's do it.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,960
- Are we taking the buggy?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,440
Oh, happy days.

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,320
This is a setup, by the way.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,000
- Yeah.
- This is rad.

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,240
Yeah.

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,240
We can just train here.
This is a good little deck.

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,600
I'll get you to do a bit
of original Bagger boxing warm-up, mate.

36
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,120
Why does your hair always look so good?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
- Do you dye it?
- Just don't wash it.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,000
It looks darker.

39
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,320
No shit, actually.
I'm not just saying that.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,000
You look good when you do it too.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,360
- Yeah?
- Mm.

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,000
All right, let's do it.

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
Three, two, one, go.

44
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,280
Obviously, yeah,

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,640
it was my decision to leave Renault.

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,280
But, uh,

47
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
yeah,

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,280
there was a few sleepless nights, I think,
trying to figure out what was best.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,400
I feel you can be honest with yourself
when you're on your own.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,840
I'll get a chance to,
like, reflect on last year.

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,040
The goals when I joined Renault was,
by year two,

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,440
the podium was really
what we believed we could be at.

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
But...

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,880
...it can't get worse than last year.

55
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,840
<i>Here comes
Daniel Ricciardo in the Renault!</i>

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,360
Okay, let's give a big round of applause
to Daniel, please. Thank you.

57
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,480
<i>Ricciardo was promised
a team that could</i>

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
<i>take the fight to the big teams,</i>

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,120
<i>and when he joined it, it was actually
a team that went backwards.</i>

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,400
<i>Oh, a big plume of smoke
from Daniel Ricciardo!</i>

61
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,760
<i>Oh dear!</i>

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Even from that point,
I was asking questions, like,

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,640
"Can I win with all cars finishing?"

64
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
Uh...

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,080
It still hurts to say this.
Like, the reality is no.

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,560
Everything just cut out.

67
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,840
<i>That looks like a massive engine problem.</i>

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,040
Deep down,
I knew that I had to go.

69
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,760
So I chose to leave.

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,520
<i>Daniel Ricciardo leaves Renault.</i>

71
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>They've lost
their star driver effectively.</i>

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,280
Last year, there was always
conversations going on with McLaren.

73
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,400
I think they made the biggest step
out of any team in 2019.

74
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,480
<i>Lando Norris, round the outside!</i>

75
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,160
<i>The Renault looks slower
than a slow thing down the straights.</i>

76
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,800
And I did
take my age into account. I'm 31.

77
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,480
So I can't afford
to chance any more seasons.

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,480
- How are you, dude?
- All good.

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,760
And I just felt McLaren was in
a better place than... than Renault was,

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,640
and that was really what...
what drove me to that decision.

81
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,680
Hello.

82
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,280
<i>Welcome along
ladies and gentlemen to round two.</i>

83
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,640
Hello.

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,880
<i>We're still in Austria,
still at the Red Bull Ring,</i>

85
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,200
<i>but this is the first ever
Styrian Grand Prix.</i>

86
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,040
Okay, you've got five minutes
until the next thing.

87
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,600
- Okay.
- Which will be in your driver room.

88
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Hello.

89
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
Oh. Can I come here or not?

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,040
Of course.

91
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,400
- Hey. How are ya?
- Hello.

92
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,400
Or whatever it is. We could do that.

93
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,000
- You're okay? All good?
- Good, mate. Yeah.

94
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,000
- Feels good to be back into it.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,240
It doesn't feel
like it's been that long actually.

96
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,320
No. It's amazing
how quickly it all comes back, huh?

97
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,880
So tell me, is, uh,
is Cyril talking to you yet?

98
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,720
Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,560
That'd be about right.

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
Oh well.

101
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,760
It's probably
a bit like being dumped by a girlfriend,

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,760
but she hasn't moved out of the house yet.

103
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,960
- All right. I'll go see my guys.
- All right.

104
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,240
All right, boys. Have fun!

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,560
It must be
an odd dynamic for Cyril.

106
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,520
Hello.

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Knowing
for the entirety of the season

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,200
that he's going
to their biggest competitor.

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,600
I'll give you some knuckles.

110
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,760
Can you go away?

111
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,400
Without the microphone.

112
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,760
It is tough.

113
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,480
You naturally shut down
to that individual, because,

114
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,160
you know, they've... they've left you.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,480
Cyril, no doubt,
took that very personally.

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,240
With the breakup,

117
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,840
uh, there was a period of time
where we've not spoken.

118
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,360
Don't forget your mask.

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,240
I am emotional. I am Latin.
I am a bit Mediterranean and French.

120
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,920
So I am emotional.
I'm not going to change what I am.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,440
Frankly, I think he's making a mistake.

122
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,720
Oh, actually, I'll take a water.

123
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,560
The drivers
with the biggest results, biggest success

124
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,400
have also been the ones
that have been able to take their time

125
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,880
and to bring stability in their own life,
in their own career.

126
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,960
But right now I have to accept
that our priority

127
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,680
is to believe in the dynamic with Daniel.

128
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,600
We need to focus on the season
that we need to do together.

129
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Hey.

130
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
All right.

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
Oh well.

132
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Itchy.

133
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,400
<i>Five days since we last
put the cars on this circuit, we go again.</i>

134
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,920
<i>Here comes Daniel Ricciardo.</i>

135
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,960
With Daniel leaving,
deciding to do something different,

136
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,960
it's a very difficult situation.

137
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,040
But on the top of that,

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,680
there is one more layer of complexity
to deal with right now.

139
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,880
<i>There goes Lance Stroll
in the Racing Point</i>

140
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,840
<i>with an awful lot of pace.</i>

141
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
It's only the second race of the season,
but we've got our first controversy,

142
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,680
and it's one that's been brewing
ever since Racing Point unveiled a car

143
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,080
that the paddock quickly nicknamed
the "Pink Mercedes,"

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,640
because the other teams
think it's so similar-looking

145
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,000
to last year's
all-conquering Mercedes Formula 1 car.

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Racing Point insist
they've done absolutely nothing wrong,

147
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,200
the car is completely legal
and within the regulations.

148
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,520
But this sleeping giant, which now has
big funding from Lawrence Stroll,

149
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,560
I think has got a lot of teams scared.

150
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
<i>Here goes Sergio Perez.</i>

151
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,880
<i>He's absolutely flying.</i>

152
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,000
You love racing, it obviously
doesn't get any better than Formula 1.

153
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,640
This year, we're already witnessing
the team, with the right resources,

154
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,520
getting an opportunity
to show what they can do.

155
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,880
<i>Watch out for Perez and Stroll.</i>

156
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
<i>Racing Point certainly have pace.</i>

157
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,560
We have bigger aspirations
than that.

158
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
And that's winning.

159
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,520
He's going well.

160
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,880
This season,

161
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,840
it seems like we've got a good chance
of being better than McLaren,

162
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
than Renault.

163
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,800
We'll have a very good chance

164
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,960
at, uh, finishing either at the top
of the midfield or a little bit higher.

165
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,160
Racing Point,
I want to understand,

166
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,680
um,

167
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
what happened there, frankly.

168
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,800
We have a car that is very much

169
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,600
uh, like the Mercedes car of last year,
painted in pink, obviously.

170
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,240
That's hurting,
because I don't understand.

171
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,080
We've made such big steps
from where we were last year.

172
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,240
It's hard to believe.

173
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,760
And I have, uh,
you know, a great car under me.

174
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,320
So I'm really just riding a good wave.

175
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,040
And, uh, there will always be
controversy in this sport.

176
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,920
There's no peace in Formula 1.

177
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,200
No team should enhance
the competitiveness of another team,

178
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,080
other than as per the regulation.

179
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,560
We'll talk after the race.

180
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,520
- Yes.
- Good.

181
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,480
A number of teams want to
understand exactly what's behind the car.

182
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,000
I think it's the tip of the iceberg,

183
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,000
that, uh, it needs to be looked at
much more closely.

184
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,120
It can give you
a good leapfrog up the order,

185
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,240
and that situation can't occur.

186
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,160
Obviously,
we've been quite vocal this year

187
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,160
that, um, you know,

188
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,400
we don't think what they've done
with their race car this year,

189
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,600
uh, is right.

190
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,440
Yeah, I heard what Zak said.

191
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,600
Quite frankly, I don't think
he's ever engineered a car in his life.

192
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,200
I don't think he's ever drawn a part
in his life.

193
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,120
So for him to say that,
that doesn't hold any water with me.

194
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,200
<i>It's approaching 2 p.m.
About 15 minutes to go till lights out.</i>

195
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,640
<i>The cars are leaving the garage.
You can hear the rev...</i>

196
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,520
Here today, for sure,
there's probably people,

197
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,240
you know, in Renault
who maybe think where you're at,

198
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,120
and kind of where your head is
and where your commitment is,

199
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,280
but my hunger for beating every driver
on the grid is still the same.

200
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,080
Five zero.

201
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,520
Ooh!

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,480
The man is light.

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,960
I'm not just driving
for a paycheck, put it that way.

204
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,280
100% athlete.

205
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,680
From my side, I...

206
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
I 100% want to try and...

207
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,200
get it through to Cyril

208
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,600
that, you know, look, um,
"McLaren is 2021."

209
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,400
"I'm not thinking about that now."

210
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
"I still really, really, really want to do
what I can with you guys."

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,160
It's immensely difficult,

212
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,880
but it's really important
to leave the emotion on one side.

213
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,360
With Daniel and myself,

214
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,920
I don't want
to build bridges artificially.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,920
Right now, our focus, our single focus,
needs to be on beating Racing Point.

216
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,800
<i>We have 20 drivers taking part here.</i>

217
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,800
<i>This is gonna be a helter-skelter...</i>

218
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,800
Cyril and I still have
a whole season in front of us

219
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,960
to get that podium.

220
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,960
So let's focus on

221
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,000
kicking some arse.

222
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,360
<i>71 great laps, I'm sure, to come.</i>

223
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,760
<i>It's the first ever Styrian Grand Prix,
and it's lights out and away we go!</i>

224
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,240
<i>Here comes Sergio Perez.</i>

225
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,000
<i>Is he gonna launch one
right around the outside?</i>

226
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,200
<i>He is. Outrageous pace from Sergio Perez.</i>

227
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,040
<i>Perez, up to fifth now.</i>

228
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,560
<i>Lance Stroll is also going to be
having a go at Ricciardo before too long.</i>

229
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,240
<i>Stroll, 0.6 behind.</i>

230
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,120
Okay. Understood.

231
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,280
<i>Stroll, 0.4 behind you.</i>

232
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,480
<i>Stroll, 0.3 behind.</i>

233
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,480
<i>Final lap. Lance Stroll
goes down the inside of Daniel Ricciardo!</i>

234
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,200
<i>Ooh! He barges his way through!</i>

235
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,680
<i>That was a clumsy move there.</i>

236
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,960
Let's go! Big points in the bag.

237
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,200
Nice one, guys.

238
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,280
I saw him
at the apex at the last moment.

239
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
If I turned in, we'd crash.

240
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,160
Pretty shit day.

241
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Shit. Shit!

242
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,080
I hate those fucking pink cars.

243
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,720
We'll talk
about how Renault got on today.

244
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,520
We're gonna talk first about Racing Point.
Lance, talk us through your race.

245
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,360
Yeah, some,
uh, great points for the team.

246
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,240
Um, there was a lot...

247
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,880
All I thought about
after the race was the battle with Stroll.

248
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,480
A bit of a controversial one.

249
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,840
<i>Stroll went off the track
and Daniel had to take avoiding action,</i>

250
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,280
<i>if Daniel hadn't got out,</i>

251
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,600
<i>he would've been pushed off
and contact would have been made.</i>

252
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,920
I was obviously upset with him.

253
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,480
But I also felt like
the Racing Point is so fast

254
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,560
they're gonna be a threat,
I think, at every circuit we go to.

255
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
Oh, fucking hell.

256
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,680
I was, I dunno, four tenths up
when I came into the pits or something.

257
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,480
- Yeah.
- But, still, the pace. I was...

258
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,600
struggling to hold on
to the Racing Points.

259
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,800
- Which is what we discussed this morning.
- Yeah. Yeah.

260
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,200
- Well...
- Fuck!

261
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,440
A number of teams
in the paddock

262
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,200
have got an issue
with that Racing Point car.

263
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,720
But all it takes is one team to protest,

264
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,120
and the first one that did
was Cyril and Renault.

265
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,440
We have decided to protest
against Racing Point.

266
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,640
We believe that this car is not legal,
doesn't comply with the regulations,

267
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,000
and, as such, should be sanctioned.

268
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,160
Renault have gone after
a part of the car

269
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,280
that you cannot see with the naked eye.

270
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,280
They're focused
on Racing Point's brake ducts.

271
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,160
Last year,
to help us with brake duct design,

272
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,800
we purchased some information
from Mercedes.

273
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,760
Information on listed parts is not allowed
to be passed from team to team,

274
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,200
which means you have to design
and develop 'em yourself.

275
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,360
The brake ducts were
a non-listed part last year

276
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,360
and are a listed part this year.

277
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
I don't think the FIA can point to a rule
that we contravened.

278
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,640
Everything we did was legal,

279
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,520
and for anybody to suggest otherwise,

280
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
um,

281
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,320
is incorrect.

282
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,840
Today,
I have the hearing for Racing Point,

283
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,760
set up by the FIA with the stewards
that will be judging the case.

284
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,760
My responsibility is to...
to make sure that I look after Renault.

285
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,680
We are not fighting
on a level playing field.

286
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,200
Marilyn, how are you?

287
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,120
I'm very well, thank you.

288
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,600
I want to understand
what Formula 1 stands for today,

289
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
and what will it stand for tomorrow?

290
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,720
That's what's at stake.

291
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,280
Not started yet. No.

292
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,320
It's very much the governing bodies
that are leading the show.

293
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,360
The FIA needs to set the tone
of what we will be up and doing.

294
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,120
"Please wait.
The meeting host will let you in soon."

295
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,560
It's not like the race start.
It doesn't start on time.

296
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,960
So, Racing Point.

297
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,960
Racing Point's arguments
are bullshit.

298
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,280
Those parts are what make
the difference in performance.

299
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,720
It's the parts
that increase the performance

300
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,760
and everyone looks after themselves.

301
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,400
That's fundamentally what makes Formula 1.

302
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,880
It's not very cool, all this.

303
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,960
Mm.

304
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
It's not the essence of F1. It's not.

305
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,880
- Yeah.
- Yeah, for sure.

306
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,280
Today, we've gotta deal
with the Renault protest, the verdict.

307
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,800
However, we're good at overcoming
those types of regulations

308
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,720
and extracting the most performance
out of a car.

309
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,080
- I'm gonna go call Lawrence.
- Yeah, okay.

310
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,960
- Good morning.
- Morning.

311
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,400
Lawrence Stroll is someone
who doesn't do things half-heartedly.

312
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,320
And he provided the very good people
at Racing Point with more resource.

313
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,760
I mean, the whole Racing Point saga,

314
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,720
it's just a little bit of, uh, comedy.

315
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,800
We have the hearing
for the protest.

316
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,280
What if it's illegal?
Then what's the next step?

317
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,040
I guess, if it's illegal,

318
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,880
it should be, uh, disqualified from all
the races that we've protested so far.

319
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,320
Yeah, that's good.

320
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,960
For me, it's very difficult,

321
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,680
'cause, you know,
it's all about the politics outside

322
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,280
and the talks and who decides what,

323
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,320
and, you know, it goes out of your control
and that's as simple as that.

324
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,040
- Will they have to change the part?
- They would have to.

325
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,960
- Go. I'll see you guys later.
- Strategy meeting.

326
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,640
- Is it now?
- Uh...

327
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,720
There's always two sides
to a protest in Formula 1.

328
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,840
But Renault feel that what Racing Point
have done this year crosses the line.

329
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,200
So today's judgment,

330
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,640
today's ruling from the FIA,

331
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,840
has massive ramifications
for the future of the sport.

332
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,280
It's been a long time coming,

333
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,240
but we're expecting the results
of the FIA protest any minute now.

334
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,840
As we know, Renault are...

335
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
Okay, we win, but not completely.

336
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,720
- Oh.
- Protest is upheld.

337
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,240
A 200,000 euro fine for each car
and a 7.5 points deduction for each car.

338
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,400
- 7.5 points. From what?
- 7.5 points?

339
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,760
Yeah.
15 points for the constructors.

340
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,960
Out of how many scored?

341
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,160
Forty-two.

342
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,920
And do they make tea all weekend
for all the teams

343
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,200
or is there any kind of forced labor?

344
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
Can I drive Otmar's car?
I think he's got a fantastic collection.

345
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,040
If I can drive his collection of cars,
I'm fine.

346
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,680
No, that's... that's a fucking...
that's fucking bullshit.

347
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,720
Let's be factual.
This decision, frankly, it's unfair.

348
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,880
What we've done
is completely legal,

349
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,080
and our competitors are kicking themselves
for not having thought of doing the same.

350
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,400
Racing Point have been fined

351
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,040
for their use of these brake ducts,
but they're allowed to keep using them.

352
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,120
Renault are not happy,
and they're not the only ones.

353
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,560
McLaren and Williams have joined
the appeal, and, crucially, Ferrari.

354
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,080
Is the penalty the right one?
Just a starting point.

355
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,800
I think, you know,
everyone's got to kind of work together

356
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,360
when we see something in the sport
that we think is outside the rules.

357
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,080
I think this is the, uh, start
of this situation, not the end.

358
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Right.

359
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,800
I know that Racing Point
didn't do anything wrong.

360
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,520
Some people felt under pressure
with their performances

361
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,320
and started on that mission,
trying to find reasons

362
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,400
why their performances were not
at the level they should have been.

363
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,680
We just acknowledged that
they did a good job, and others didn't.

364
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:25,040
Racing Point. Well, Otmar, fined,
points deducted, 400,000 euros.

365
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
Does it feel
like a real knockdown right now for you?

366
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,480
Well, it's not ideal.

367
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,120
It's a shame that the protest was upheld,
but we did absolutely nothing wrong.

368
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,360
Otmar, 24 hours to appeal. Will you do it?

369
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,200
We read the sporting regulations.

370
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,000
There is nothing specific in there
that says we couldn't do what we did.

371
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,520
But the car is legal.

372
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,960
The brake ducts
are compliant with the regulations

373
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,640
and we can continue to run 'em
for the rest of the year.

374
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,400
Um, so are you gonna appeal?
You have 24 hours.

375
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,760
24 hours.

376
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,440
They're saying that you've got
no intentional wrongdoing, is the gist?

377
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,240
Yeah, I think
there's no wrongdoing whatsoever.

378
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,360
It's just the rules were ambiguous,
and still are today.

379
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,960
The verdict itself is flawed.

380
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,000
We invited the FIA into the factory.

381
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,760
We showed 'em all of our designs,
and they were completely fine with that.

382
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,560
So the verdict today was, um...

383
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,280
uh, illogical to me.

384
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,680
We didn't... We didn't contravene one rule.

385
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,960
That's ridiculous.

386
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah, the fine's a joke, isn't it,
to someone like their team owner.

387
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
There he is.

388
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,040
♪ <i>Down at the bottom of the ocean ♪</i>

389
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,080
<i>♪ Down at the bottom of the sea ♪</i>

390
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,680
<i>♪ I will stay down, down ♪</i>

391
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,440
<i>♪ Gone, long gone ♪</i>

392
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,080
Okay,
whenever you're ready to roll.

393
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,680
- In your own time
- Baby, go.

394
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Good morning.

395
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,520
I do not often speak publicly.

396
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,200
However, I'm extremely angry
at any suggestion that we have cheated.

397
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,320
This team, under various names, has
competed in Formula 1 for over 30 years.

398
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,160
Between 2016 and '18,
this was the fourth-best team on the grid.

399
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,160
We've always been a constructor,
and will continue to be so in the future.

400
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,360
Beyond the clear fact that Racing Point
complied with the technical regulations,

401
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,080
I am appalled by the way
Renault, McLaren, Ferrari and Williams

402
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,920
have taken this opportunity to appeal,

403
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,960
and, in doing so, attempted
to distract from our performances.

404
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,840
These accusations
are completely unacceptable and not true.

405
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,680
They are dragging our name
through the mud,

406
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,280
and I will not stand by, nor accept this.

407
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,480
In closing,
we did absolutely nothing wrong.

408
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,640
We stayed within the rules.

409
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,680
And we will demonstrate and prove that
through the appeal process.

410
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,560
Thank you for your time.

411
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,760
- Good?
- Good.

412
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,176
- Very good.
- Nailed it?

413
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,440
Nailed it. Well done.

414
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,080
This whole
"Pink Mercedes" thing is nonsense.

415
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,680
Our competitors, I think
they have to look at their own competence.

416
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,520
They have their own factories.
They have their own guys.

417
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,600
They simply didn't do a good enough job.

418
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,960
Okay, now let's race
and let's fix this problem.

419
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Uh, mate,
he wants us to be ready.

420
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

421
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,680
The Racing Point protest,
at the end of the day,

422
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
I see them as a competitor right now,

423
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,360
and if they're faster,
we've gotta find a way to do better.

424
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,960
<i>We're 40 minutes away
from the start of the British Grand Prix.</i>

425
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,920
<i>Glorious sounds
of engines beginning to rev.</i>..

426
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,120
It's up to us now to demonstrate
what we have to achieve as a team.

427
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,760
And what you want is to win.

428
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,760
And we want to beat them.

429
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,920
- That front wing looks like ours, Cyril.
- Yeah.

430
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,280
We took some pictures.

431
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,400
Fuck!

432
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,560
<i>One minute.
Engines start, and drop the car down.</i>

433
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,960
As of today,

434
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,920
a very basic goal I have for myself
is to leave this track with no regrets.

435
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,440
No hesitations. Just conviction.

436
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,160
Decisiveness.

437
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,400
I want to beat that team.

438
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,520
You have to do it. It's just...

439
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,120
You have to do it.

440
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,960
<i>Great start for Daniel Ricciardo!</i>

441
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,240
Okay, Lance,
Ricciardo close behind.

442
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Okay. Copy.

443
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,080
Okay, Daniel, just keep pushing.

444
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,720
Yep. Understood.

445
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,480
<i>Here comes Daniel Ricciardo</i>

446
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,080
<i>round the outside of Lance Stroll.</i>

447
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,360
Come on, DR!

448
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,480
<i>He's done it. Gets the move done.</i>

449
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Frickin'!

450
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,200
He's pulling away from me..

451
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,880
- <i>Allez!</i>
- Yeah!

452
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,680
Shit. What happened?

453
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,760
Okay, Esteban.
It's Stroll in front of you.

454
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,040
Vettel behind you.

455
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Copy, yeah.

456
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,400
<i>Here comes Sebastian Vettel!</i>

457
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,720
<i>Locks up, can't get past Ocon.</i>

458
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,520
All of us at Renault, we have a vision
for where we want to take the team.

459
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,200
With Daniel leaving,
Esteban is absolutely crucial.

460
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,280
<i>Ocon to the inside
of Lance Stroll into the left-hander.</i>

461
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,480
<i>Wheel to wheel,
Stroll's trying to hang on,</i>

462
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,640
<i>and he manages it.</i>

463
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,320
Ah, c'mon!

464
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,000
<i>Here comes Ocon again!</i>

465
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,800
<i>This time, to the outside.
Stroll squeezes him.</i>

466
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,440
<i>And he still keeps hold of ninth place.</i>

467
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,800
Push all you've got.
Push all you've got.

468
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,600
<i>I am pushing.</i>

469
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,880
This is gonna be tough.

470
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,040
<i>Ooh, there's a lock-up as well.</i>

471
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,560
<i>So is the pressure intensifying, I wonder,</i>

472
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,240
<i>as Esteban Ocon is now
only half a second behind Lance Stroll?</i>

473
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
C'mon!

474
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,920
<i>Two drivers, really going for it.</i>

475
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,640
<i>And Esteban Ocon is past the Racing Point!</i>

476
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
C'mon!

477
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,840
Yes!

478
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,200
<i>Having stared at the back
of that Racing Point all race long,</i>

479
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,040
<i>Esteban's got past
and up into eighth place.</i>

480
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,080
Now we've got a race.

481
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,400
<i>So Hamilton leads from Valtteri Bottas.</i>

482
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,720
<i>Then, in third, comes Max Verstappen.</i>

483
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,880
<i>Behind them though, they're still
squabbling away for position.</i>

484
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,960
Okay, Daniel,
so currently, you're P7.

485
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,920
Same pace as Norris and Sainz ahead.

486
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,640
Understood.

487
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,440
<i>Ricciardo is putting
Lando Norris under pressure.</i>

488
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,960
<i>Ah, brilliant stuff there.
He moves up into sixth place.</i>

489
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,080
Go on!

490
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,760
Come on, DR! Boom!

491
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,920
<i>It's game on now, isn't it?</i>

492
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,240
<i>Okay, nice job.
Sainz in front of you, next one.</i>

493
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,760
Okay.

494
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,760
One thing I must say is that,
watching Daniel,

495
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,160
right now, it's something that's making me
feel the frustration and disappointment.

496
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,760
Not just for what we have achieved
so far together,

497
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,520
but also for what he would achieve
after... after that.

498
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,880
But he decided to make the decision
when he decided to make it,

499
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,200
with just one year together,
in such a short region of time.

500
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,960
<i>You're doing a good job.
Two tenths quicker than Sainz ahead.</i>

501
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,520
Okay, yep. Understood.

502
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,320
<i>Here come the Mercedes,
stretching their advantage out front.</i>

503
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,840
<i>Oh, and what's happened? Bottas.
There's a puff of smoke there.</i>

504
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,880
<i>We'll try and figure out what's happened.</i>

505
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,040
So Bottas has
a front-left puncture.

506
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Understood.

507
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,720
<i>Now, Bottas pits.</i>

508
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,840
<i>Sainz and Ricciardo
go through ahead of Bottas</i>

509
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,200
Okay. Currently, you're P5.
Seeing a few punctures.

510
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,320
<i>How are the tires?</i>

511
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,520
They're okay.
I can hold this for now.

512
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,560
Carlos is struggling
with vibration,

513
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,520
so let's keep the pressure up on him.

514
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Let's go.

515
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
<i>Ooh, Sainz has gone wide.</i>

516
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,520
<i>The same thing's happened to the McLaren.
The tires are failing at Silverstone.</i>

517
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,320
Come on, Daniel!

518
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,800
<i>And Ricciardo's
got through, up to fourth position.</i>

519
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,480
Yeah! Go on!

520
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,040
Nice job, mate.
Let's bring it home now.

521
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,280
<i>Daniel Ricciardo is
on his way</i>

522
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,280
<i>to take fourth position in this race.</i>

523
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,800
<i>What a performance that is.</i>

524
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,760
Woo-hoo!

525
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Fuck.

526
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,960
Nice. Nice. Nice.

527
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,880
He gave everything.

528
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,360
<i>Great race, Daniel.</i>

529
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,800
Got a bit exciting at the end.

530
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,520
Super race. Thanks a lot.

531
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,200
<i>And Esteban Ocon crosses
the line to finish sixth.</i>

532
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,040
Great drive, Esteban.

533
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,840
Awesome. Good points.

534
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,240
<i>Super team result. Super.</i>

535
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,800
The last three laps,
just mayhem, mate.

536
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,680
Mate, good race. P4, boy.

537
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,880
- Yeah.
- You and Esteban were doing well.

538
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,920
You have the perfect lineup

539
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,360
to be ready
for that kind of opportunity, right?

540
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,040
Exactly.
I mean, when the car is reliable...

541
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:42,200
I have to admit that,
with Daniel, I want to move on,

542
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,720
so that we are extremely focused,
150% focused,

543
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,280
on what's going to be
a super-intense season together.

544
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,880
Everyone wants
to talk to you. Everyone.

545
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,960
Maybe another lap or two,
we could be on the podium,

546
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,400
but, uh, we have next week,
another chance.

547
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,560
We all want
to see Daniel on the podium with Renault

548
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,840
as quickly as possible.

549
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,880
Right now, we have a job to do together.

550
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,320
To finish fourth,
it's really cool, so very happy.

551
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,800
Um, yeah,
just feels quite rewarding, this one.

552
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,320
- So close!
- So close!

553
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,696
- So close.
- That's good.

554
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,840
- Thank you for that. Thank you.
- No worries.

555
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,400
And thank you
for a couple of very nice maneuvers.

556
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,960
It was nice.
It was fun, huh? It was a fun race.

557
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,160
- Crazy.
- Thanks for that. Cheers.

558
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,080
Here, today,
after what we have achieved together,

559
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,680
maybe all of us are a bit closer.

560
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,040
I am in the process
of rebuilding my relationship with him.

561
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,880
Even though I have...

562
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,160
I have full confidence
that he will regret his decision.

563
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,240
Sitting here today, I don't know if
it's the best call I've ever made or not.

564
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,680
I've obviously, in a way,
taken a bit of a punt.

565
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,720
It could swing either way.

566
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
I'll need a whiskey.

567
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,960
<i>Pierre Gasly,
what an incredible run of form.</i>

568
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,360
Now we're gonna score some fucking points.

569
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,360
Alex has to prove
he's worthy of that seat.

570
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,040
<i>Albon and Gasly, wheel to wheel.</i>

571
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,680
The fight is on.

572
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,160
Last year, Carlos and Lando
had a great relationship.

573
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,920
This year, is very different.

574
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,920
Carlos, one. Lando, zero.

575
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,480
How do you sum up
our season this year?

576
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,080
It's one short word.

577
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,920
Shit.
