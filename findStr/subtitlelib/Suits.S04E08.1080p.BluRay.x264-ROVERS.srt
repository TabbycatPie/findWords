00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,650
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,161
- You really know him.
- I really do.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,489
- Never?
- No.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,683
- Why not?
- Because you can never go back.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,849
LOUIS: Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,770
through Switzerland and the Caymans
before it comes out on the other side.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,006
And you're obligated to report it.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,730
I didn't. And I'm not going to.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,080
What are you talking about?
Rachel...

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,965
Logan and I kissed.
Mike, no, please. I...

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,209
When I said that it didn't matter
what I do next because I have you,

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,323
I was wrong, because we're done.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,242
That's your fee for
putting this deal together.

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,528
Son of a bitch, you didn't bring me here
for you to sign on the arrows.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,444
You brought me here for me
to sign on the arrows.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,402
Yep.

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,045
You cannot take a job with that man.

18
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,971
What are you going to do about it?

19
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,162
- I hired Mike Ross back at the firm.
- What?

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,681
- You're really going to drop me?
- You're damn right I am.

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,926
I never want to see you again.

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,200
Are you back here?

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,286
No, no. I'm staying
somewhere for a while.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,050
- Mike, please.
- Rachel, whatever you're going to say,

25
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,929
now is not the time to say it.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,930
I'm coming back to work tomorrow.

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,723
If you can't accept that then whatever
you were going to say to me,

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,562
won't matter.

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,322
(SINGING) I told her
this time I'm gone

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,964
It would never be the same

31
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,848
You'll be left all alone

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,880
Only you to blame

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,691
Paralyzed

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,083
Paralyzed

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,048
Running paralyzed

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,961
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,721
So hold me
'cause this is the end

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,331
Life is my guide

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,011
There is no need
for us to suspend

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,689
This feeling inside

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,369
- I thought you might need this.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,684
So, the way I see it,
you've got three options.

43
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,043
You can wear what
you were wearing last night,

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,850
you can go back
to your place and change,

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,169
or you can grab anything
you want from my closet.

46
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,811
Nothing? I thought for sure
you would leap at the chance.

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,564
Mike's coming back
to work today.

48
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,569
- I know.
- What am I going to do?

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,889
You're going to do what you've
been doing since the day Mike left.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,321
You're going to walk into Harvey's office
with your head held high,

51
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,249
- and you're going to do your job.
- Mike's job.

52
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,843
I don't know how to be
near him without being near him.

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,241
I'll tell you how.

54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,081
- Give him space.
- I don't want to give him space.

55
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,530
I want to run to him and hold him
and tell him that I love him.

56
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,325
I know. But, Rachel, if you try
to pull him towards you right now,

57
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,169
all you're going to do
is push him away.

58
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,961
Trust me. Let things be. They'll turn out
the way they're supposed to.

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,610
You don't know that.

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,606
I do know that.

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,770
(SIGHS) okay-

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,566
Rachel, I'm going to tell you something
I've never told you.

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,524
I slept with Harvey.

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,403
Oh, my God.

65
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,251
- But you told me...
- I know what I told you.

66
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,128
It was once and I never would have done
it if we were still working together.

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,531
But then he left the DA's office and...

68
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,804
It happened.

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,570
And then the next time I saw him, he
wanted me to come with him to the firm,

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,011
and I did, and that was that.

71
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,764
Would you have wanted
a relationship with him?

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,769
I would've wanted to try.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,840
But he wasn't ready.

74
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,571
And if I had pushed him to be ready,

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,763
I would be sitting here talking
to somebody else about somebody

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,803
I used to work with a long time ago.

77
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,567
What are you saying?

78
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,768
I'm saying everything turned out
the way it was supposed to.

79
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,850
But you said the reason
that you two never...

80
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,962
ls because you can
never go back.

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,410
I lied.

82
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,888
Oh. I'd let you go,
but I was here first.

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Words to live by, by Harvey Specter,
the most selfish man in the world.

84
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,888
- Don't mind if I do.
- Wait a second.

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,800
- What are you doing here so early?
- I always get in this early.

86
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,371
You never get in this early.

87
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,724
And I know that for a fact, because this is
the time I get in every single day.

88
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,683
You should sleep in once in a while.
It's good for you.

89
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,882
Trust me. I do it every single day.

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,884
It just so happens that this morning,
I have work to do.

91
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,161
What work?

92
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,689
- The "Schmoolkinsberg" brief.
- The "Schmoolkinsberg" brief?

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,531
- That's what you're going with?
- It's not going to write itself.

94
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,642
I'm taking your name off the wall.

95
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,888
Seriously, I'm here for
the Tokyo markets. (LAUGHS)

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,810
- Name one Tokyo market.
- The Nikkei.

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,967
Name another.

98
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,283
Honda, Toyota, Kia.

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,245
- Kia is Korean.
- Yeah, but they're in the same time zone.

100
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,203
Where it is currently dinner.

101
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,205
I'm a little tired of this inquisition.

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,482
This is exactly why
I don't come in this early.

103
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,365
Oh, and the reason that
you're here this early this morning

104
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,801
is because it's Mike Ross'
first day back.

105
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,887
Is it?

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,207
Louis, why are you
here so early?

107
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,961
I am taking this Forstman document
and I am burying it deep

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,765
in the bowels of these files,

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,125
and then I am putting these files
deep in the bowels of our storage.

110
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,811
Louis, please stop saying bowels.

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,684
Katrina, I don't have to time
to give a shit about bowels.

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,131
Because after this,
we are starting fresh.

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,810
And I don't want to hear
about Gillie Industries,

114
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,928
Sean Cahill,
Charles Forstman ever again.

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,610
Well, look who it is.

116
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,206
Bonnie and Clyde.
Just the people I wanted to see.

117
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,529
- What do you want, Sean?
- To serve you with this.

118
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,846
What the hell is that?

119
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,171
He wants all files relating
to the Gillie Industries takeover.

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,487
Oh, I don't want the files.
I'm taking them.

121
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,649
Bullshit. We have 60 days
to fight that or comply.

122
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,921
SEAN: You want to tell him,
or should I?

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,771
It's not a subpoena, Harvey.
It's a search warrant.

124
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,008
SEAN: So, you're going to
give me all the files,

125
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,130
or you're going to head downtown
with these two fine gentlemen.

126
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,720
Okay, Sean.
Have it your way.

127
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,050
You're going to take that hall.

128
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,889
You're going to run into
what appears to be

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,843
the mummified remains
of a legal secretary.

130
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,485
- Her name is Norma.
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,409
She's going to limp you
up to the 60th floor,

132
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,921
where you will find
30 years worth of files

133
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,042
that haven't been sorted
since the Reagan Administration.

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,289
- Or is it the 56th floor?
- It could be the 35th floor for all I know.

135
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,721
The point is, while you're trying
to find the ark of the covenant,

136
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,844
we'll be downtown, in front of a judge,
blocking this bullshit.

137
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,327
You think the threat of you getting
to a judge before I find what I want

138
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,886
- is going to get me to leave?
- Then stay.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,287
But who do you think
is going to get the job done faster,

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,928
you and those two Windbreakers,
or Bonnie and Clyde?

141
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,924
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,687
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

143
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,844
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

144
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,964
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

145
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,324
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

146
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,927
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

147
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,606
All right!

148
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,009
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

149
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,284
The greenback boogie

150
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,281
Welcome home, sailor.

151
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,802
- You were out to sea a long time.
- I was. But now I'm back.

152
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,769
This place hasn't changed a bit.

153
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,241
- Maybe it has.
- Is this a new Spinner's album?

154
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,966
No. And you know it's not new.
You and Harvey joked about it.

155
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,491
I could have sworn
that was a different one.

156
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,125
Said the man with
a photographic memory.

157
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,805
Okay, that doesn't mean
I've seen every album he ever...

158
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,888
- You have no idea where to go, do you?
- Not a clue.

159
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,571
Come with me.

160
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,762
Donna, I went to the bullpen, some guy
with a soul patch was sitting at my desk.

161
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,609
That's because it's
not your desk anymore,

162
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,529
and you're not cool enough
to pull off a soul patch.

163
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,641
I dispute that.

164
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,604
Are you even capable
of growing a soul patch?

165
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,769
I had a goatee in my sophomore year
of never.

166
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,211
Look, it's not your desk anymore,

167
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,765
because you're on the other side
of the bullpen now.

168
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,961
Which other side?

169
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,009
The other side,
like not the side that you were on.

170
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
Towards the door,
or away from the door?

171
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,481
Which door are you talking about?

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,726
- Which door are you talking about?
- You know what?

173
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,211
Just shut up and keep walking.

174
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,881
You're not here five minutes and
you're already a pain in my ass.

175
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,048
(CLEARS THROAT)
This is the other side of the bullpen.

176
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,126
- Are you serious?
- I know.

177
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,480
I fought it tooth and nail.

178
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,961
I mean if it were up to me, you'd
be setting up shop in the file room.

179
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
You did this, didn't you?

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,282
Well, I didn't not do it.

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,571
- Thanks, Donna.
- It's good to have you back, Mike.

182
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,405
Well, some of us have work to do.

183
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,727
And of course, by some of us,
I mean you.

184
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,009
As soon as word got out
that you were coming back,

185
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,881
the partners started taking numbers
to give the boy wonder their work.

186
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,041
Thanks, Donna.

187
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,242
- You already thanked me.
- Not for that.

188
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,971
- For not mentioning Rachel.
- Mike.

189
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,209
Come on, you expect me to believe
you don't know what's going on?

190
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,926
I know enough to know
that it's between you and her.

191
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,371
- Shit, look who's back.
- Shit, look who's still here.

192
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,766
Somebody had to pick up your slack

193
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,644
while you were shitting
the bed on Wall Street.

194
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,006
Which is why it's good
to be back here,

195
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,243
where there's a shitty lawyer like you
to make me look good.

196
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,765
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks, Katrina.

197
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,851
- Don't thank me. Thank Louis.
- Oh, I did, when he hired me back.

198
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,043
I'm sure you did. And I'm sure
he would never tell you this,

199
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,085
but I wanted you to know what
he gave up to bring you back here.

200
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,487
What are you talking about?

201
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,450
Jessica gave Louis one wish
when he closed Forstman,

202
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,921
and he had a whole plan
to manage his work schedule

203
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,170
so he could try to reignite things
with Sheila, and he gave all that up,

204
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,490
because he cared more about
you than he did about himself.

205
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,046
- I didn't know that.
- Well, like I said, I thought you should.

206
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,565
Welcome back.

207
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,561
I have court in 10 minutes.

208
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,489
Now what are you three doing
in front of my face?

209
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,762
We're here because he showed up
in our offices this morning

210
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,847
with a search warrant.

211
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,725
A search warrant, I'm sorry to say,
you have no authority to stop.

212
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,282
Yes, you do, because he deliberately
went outside your authority to get it.

213
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,686
- What?
- Your Honor,

214
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,802
I went to a different judge,
because my office tried to reach you,

215
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,807
but you were unavailable.

216
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,445
Check with your clerk,
there's a record of the call.

217
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,164
Did you make it from
Judge Franklin's house?

218
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,170
Because he's the one who signed
the warrant at 8:30 last night.

219
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,567
The same judge you play
golf with, every Thursday.

220
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,207
And Barack Obama plays basketball
with Eric Holder. Let's arrest everybody.

221
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,243
I'm not interested in everybody.

222
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,850
I'm interested in
why you went around me.

223
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,325
Because I needed a warrant last night

224
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,568
to stop them from destroying evidence
this morning.

225
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,848
And the day someone's guilty
until proven innocent

226
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,691
is the day that argument
holds an ounce of water.

227
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,080
Better get your glass, Harvey.

228
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,850
That day is coming sooner
than you think.

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,927
Well, it's not today.

230
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,160
I'm revoking your search warrant
until we can have a full hearing.

231
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,361
- Your Honor, I'm...
- That's enough.

232
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,689
If you want to go rummaging around
in a law firln's files,

233
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,371
you better come to me
with more than innuendo.

234
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,362
I better get going.

235
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,926
I have to look up the word "innuendo",
if you know what I mean.

236
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,966
Harvey, I'm telling you,
that man is not going to stop coming.

237
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,845
I'm going to suggest
something radical here.

238
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,166
And what is that?

239
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,442
We could just give him
what he wants.

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,410
The fact is, we've got nothing to hide.

241
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,249
Harvey, I don't care that
we have nothing to hide.

242
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,329
A police officer follows
a car long enough,

243
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,010
he's going to find a busted taillight.

244
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,771
And even if he doesn't,
he's going to bust it himself.

245
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,848
- Then what are you suggesting we do?
- I don't know.

246
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,487
But this whole witch-hunt is about Cahill
thinking you colluded with Mike Ross.

247
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,681
So, now that he's back,

248
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,327
why don't you collude with that fraud
and get us the hell out of this.

249
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,282
I see you got yourself an office.

250
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,803
It's not as nice as the one I had, but...

251
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,927
It's still a step up.

252
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,441
You mean because it's smaller,
or because the view is worse?

253
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,927
I mean because it's my old office.

254
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,126
- You're shitting me.
- Look in the top left drawer.

255
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,928
- You're serious.
- I am.

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,206
Donna said she did this.

257
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,041
She had the idea to give you an office.
It was my idea to give you this office.

258
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,491
And it just happened to be empty?

259
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,125
- Something like that.
- Right.

260
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,523
Good to have you back
where you belong.

261
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,010
Okay, enough fun.

262
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,960
Sean Cahill's trying to go through every
file we have on the takeover. You in?

263
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,521
I sure as hell don't want to do
an amicus brief for Paul Porter.

264
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,801
Good. Then figure out a way

265
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,486
to keep Cahill from
getting his hands on our documents.

266
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,489
And do it fast, because
we don't have much time.

267
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,250
Harvey, have you considered the fact

268
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,328
that he's been going after us
for collusion

269
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,761
- and we didn't collude?
- What are you getting at?

270
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,769
Well, why don't we just
give him all the files?

271
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,611
We have nothing to hide and
fighting him makes it look like we do.

272
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,768
That's what I said to Jessica.
You know what she said to me?

273
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,248
A cop follows a car long enough,
he's going to find a busted taillight.

274
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,807
And even if he doesn't, he's going
to bust it himself. (SIGHS)

275
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,970
Speaking of Jessica, you never told me
how she felt about me coming back.

276
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,801
Find a way to beat Cahill
and then ask me that again.

277
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,804
You just had to get to him first,
didn't you?

278
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,961
What'd you give him, a lock of your hair?

279
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,206
What are you talking about, Louis?

280
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,322
You think I didn't notice

281
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,601
you conveniently put Henderson
in my old office

282
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,841
so you could give Mike your old office?

283
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,042
For your information, Louis,

284
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,811
Henderson begged
for your old office, because

285
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,685
he thinks you're the best attorney
that's ever walked the face of this earth.

286
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,926
Oh, bull... Really?

287
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,567
Absolutely.

288
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,411
So you're not just saying
that to butter me up so I'll let this go?

289
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,366
Hand to God.

290
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,404
Or as Henderson would say,
hand to Louis.

291
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,883
Okay, then, just as long as
you're not trying to pull one over on me.

292
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,643
That Henderson is going places.

293
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,891
Don't move.

294
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,485
What... What are you doing?

295
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,090
Taking a mental picture of this moment.

296
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,371
Louis, that's not a mental...
(IMITATES CAMERA CLICKING)

297
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,926
Mike Ross, the prodigal son, returns.

298
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,685
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

299
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,929
And, Louis, I want to thank you again
for bringing me back.

300
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,764
I'm never going to forget it.

301
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,850
And if there's ever anything
that I can do to repay you...

302
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,921
Mike, please don't insult me.
You do not owe me.

303
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,090
And if you really care about me,

304
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,686
you will never mention repaying me
with a favor again.

305
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,924
- I really appreciate it, Louis.
- Good.

306
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,329
Now, I need you to drop
whatever it is you're doing and...

307
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,364
Louis, I can't drop what I'm doing.
Harvey just asked me to...

308
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,606
What do you mean you can't
drop what you're doing?

309
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,846
I just brought you
back here, you owe me.

310
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,450
You just told me never
to mention that again.

311
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,846
What, you think I meant that?

312
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,121
I said that because
that's what people say.

313
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,083
And now what you say is, "Screw
what Harvey asked me to do.

314
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,487
"I don't give a shit about him,
I only give a shit about you, Louis."

315
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,166
Louis, this isn't just for Harvey,
it's for the firm. Okay?

316
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,884
- Sean Cahill is...
- Bullshit.

317
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,241
That's just the kind of thing
that Harvey... Did you just...

318
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,249
Did you just...
Did you just say Sean Cahill?

319
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,931
Yeah. He's trying to get access
to our files on the Gilles takeover.

320
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,247
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

321
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,971
We need to fight this son of a bitch
with the full force of the law, Mike.

322
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,764
- That's what I was doing.
- Then do it.

323
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,850
You don't have time to work on
this case. I need to bring it to Katrina.

324
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,646
- Louis, are you okay?
- No, I am not okay.

325
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,886
Mike, this is an attack on our firm.

326
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,122
And an attack against one of us
is an attack against all of us.

327
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,083
- Get the hell to work.
- You're...

328
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,686
We're in trouble. Sean Cahill
is trying to get the Gillie files.

329
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,525
Louis, you buried that document.

330
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,650
You don't understand. The SEC is going
to have these files forever.

331
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,841
And eventually they're going to see

332
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,803
the money went in one place
and came out the other,

333
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,921
and I'm the person who did it.

334
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,081
What do you need me to do?

335
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,202
I want you to cover up my tracks
as best you can.

336
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,522
- And what are you going to do?
- I'm going to try and fix it

337
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,961
so the goddamn thing never
happened in the first place.

338
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,881
What are you doing here?

339
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,561
I didn't think we had
any further business to discuss.

340
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,650
We don't. We just have a problem
with the business we just did.

341
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,569
Are you here to shake me down
for more money?

342
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,842
- I'm here to give it all back.
- Louis, I told you...

343
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,122
Now, just listen to me, okay.
The SEC,

344
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,005
they're trying to get access to our files.
That happens,

345
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,442
they see that your payout was routed
offshore and you didn't pay taxes on it...

346
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,841
They'll see I haven't paid taxes.

347
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,851
I have until the third quarter of two years
from now to report that income.

348
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,443
- And if I need to, I will.
- Are you crazy? They're not idiots.

349
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,848
Nobody has money wired
through a Swiss Bank and the Caymans

350
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,849
if they're planning on
reporting it to the IRS.

351
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,644
That's not proof of anything.

352
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,764
And the only thing they'll definitely find
if they get a look at those files

353
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,451
is that you've embezzled money.
So get out of my office.

354
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,002
Listen to me, goddamn it!
We need to undo this deal.

355
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,325
I'll tell you what, Louis.

356
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,166
Have a seat.

357
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,046
You want peace of mind?

358
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,090
Draw up the same paperwork
we already signed.

359
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,644
Only this time,

360
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,967
- have Harvey sign it instead of you.
- What?

361
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,526
You're the one who said you'd go to
the ends of the earth to stick it to him.

362
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,849
Taking his client is one thing,
framing him for a felony, that's another.

363
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,610
It's your call.

364
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,485
Use your name, replace it with his,
I don't give a shit.

365
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,042
But the deal is staying in place.

366
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,850
I heard they hired
a new hotshot attorney,

367
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,769
but they never said
how handsome he was.

368
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,484
Look, Rachel, I'm really
swamped right now.

369
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,847
Too swamped to even
stop by and say hello?

370
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,088
Saying hello is just going to lead
to saying a lot more,

371
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,690
and now's not the time
to have it out.

372
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,564
Well, I'm not here
to have it out with you.

373
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,763
I am here to work with you
on fighting off Sean Cahill.

374
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,928
- I don't need any help.
- But you just said you were swamped.

375
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,963
Because I'm trying to avoid
having a conversation with you,

376
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,565
which obviously isn't working.

377
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,761
Well, Mike, I am
Harvey's associate now.

378
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,609
So you're working a case
with him, you're working it with me.

379
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,960
He didn't say anything
to me about it.

380
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,970
Well, he said it to me.
Why do you think I'm here?

381
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,769
I don't care what he said.
It's not a good idea.

382
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,922
What isn't? For us to even be
in the same room together?

383
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,121
Not right now, no.

384
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,569
You're the one who chose
to come back here.

385
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,921
So?

386
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,567
So you don't get to act disappointed
that I work here, too.

387
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,729
Rachel, listen to me,
I told you that I needed space.

388
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,842
What do you call staying at a hotel?

389
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,566
Based on this conversation,
I'd call it a smart move.

390
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,762
Okay, Mike, I'm sorry. Look...

391
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,769
- Where are you going?
- To get some air.

392
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,883
Wow. They hire you back
after helping them break the law,

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,126
and this is what they give you for lunch?

394
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,851
You wouldn't ask that
if you'd ever had one of these bagels.

395
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,008
Maybe not. But let me ask you this.

396
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,282
Remember that game show
called Let's Make A Deal?

397
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,762
Not interested.

398
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,044
- You haven't heard what's in it for you.
- I don't need to hear what's in it for me,

399
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,003
because I know what's in it for you.

400
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,887
You're a smart kid.
I see why they wanted you back.

401
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,047
I need to get back to my bagel,

402
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,562
which is going to taste so much better
when I'm not looking at you.

403
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,927
All right, before you gobble that up,
think about this.

404
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,921
Sooner or later,
I'm going to get those files.

405
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,370
But there's nothing to stop you
from giving them to me all on your own.

406
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,491
If you do that,

407
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,489
any of those files that say Mike Ross,

408
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,810
I'll replace with "anonymous
former employee."

409
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,682
That would be tempting, Sean,
if I actually had something to hide.

410
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,928
Oh, I do have one more
question, though.

411
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,371
Is Harvey footing the bill?

412
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,849
- What?
- For your room.

413
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,291
The Soho Grand.

414
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,290
That's where you're staying, right?

415
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,922
You should try the Cobb Salad.
It's out of this world.

416
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,011
Guess who just got propositioned
by a striking blonde?

417
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,448
- Please tell me it was Kate Upton.
- Isn't she a little young for you?

418
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,369
Last night she told me
I was the perfect age.

419
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,606
To be her father.

420
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,688
When are you going to understand,
they all want a daddy, Mike?

421
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,290
You want to talk about Cahill,
or just keep bragging

422
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,731
about things that never
actually happened?

423
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,041
What did Cahill want?

424
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,447
Well, it's not what he wanted.
It's what he gave me.

425
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,402
Well, let's have it.

426
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,045
Son of a bitch knew
I was staying at a hotel.

427
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,082
What are you getting at?

428
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,804
Didn't you say he sidestepped
Judge Hopkins

429
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,524
to get a search warrant
for our files?

430
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,763
You're thinking he went around Hopkins
to get authorization to follow us?

431
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,008
I'm thinking he never got
authorization at all.

432
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,488
Then we need to get a list of the SEC's
requests for surveillance by tomorrow.

433
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,081
I have a friend at Justice.

434
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,442
Since when?

435
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,049
Okay, I don't.
But I thought it sounded cool.

436
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,687
Mike, this is serious. We need that list
and we need it by tomorrow.

437
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,642
On it.

438
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,041
Good news, Louis. I not only...

439
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,049
misfiled and misdated that document,

440
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,130
I added in 10,000 others
that look just like it.

441
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,211
That thing is as buried
as it's ever going to be.

442
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,971
What the hell difference does it make?
It's all for nothing.

443
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,366
- What happened with Forstman?
- What do you think?

444
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,641
- He didn't go for it.
- No, something else happened,

445
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,125
because you wouldn't be this upset
if he just turned you down.

446
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,725
He wouldn't undo anything.

447
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,204
But he is willing to let me
pin the whole thing on Harvey.

448
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,210
- How would you even do that?
- Well, I don't know.

449
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,322
Make up a new document,
forge his signature.

450
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,330
Doesn't matter,
because I'm not going to do it.

451
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,568
- Louis.
- Katrina, enough.

452
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,128
You did good work, but the truth is

453
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,686
if we have to turn over those files,
they find that transaction,

454
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,649
I'm going to end up in prison.

455
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,401
Then you and I

456
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,960
better figure out a way
to make sure Harvey wins that motion.

457
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,050
Okay-

458
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,488
Don't you have a funny way
of giving someone space?

459
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,442
What?

460
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,211
Not only did you do exactly
what we talked about not doing,

461
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,687
but you lied and you used
Harvey's name to do it.

462
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,128
- I'm sorry.
- No, sorry is not good enough.

463
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,971
This is the second time
we've had this conversation recently,

464
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,321
and I want to know
why the hell we are having it again.

465
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,967
I didn't mean to lie. I just...

466
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,807
- I went to Mike to talk...
- That's my point.

467
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,251
You couldn't even
make it through one day?

468
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,842
I thought that I could. And then,
I saw him sitting there and I just...

469
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,644
Rachel, just because
something's hard to do,

470
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,046
doesn't mean that you can't do it.

471
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,889
Okay. I shouldn't have
brought Harvey into it,

472
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,731
but I am not going to apologize
for talking to Mike,

473
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,763
because he and I aren't
the same as you and Harvey.

474
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,967
Excuse me?

475
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,921
That didn't come out the way
that I wanted it to.

476
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,691
I did not tell you that
for you to just throw it back in my face.

477
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,961
I didn't mean to throw it
in your face.

478
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,569
I respect that you let things
take their natural course,

479
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,411
but I want to make things
work with Mike.

480
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,244
And the only way I know how to do that
is to fight for him.

481
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,124
Fight for him all you want.

482
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,927
But don't lie about Harvey ever again.

483
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,966
(SIGHS)

484
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,044
You missing it in here already?

485
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,770
Just passing through.

486
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,847
I lied to you.

487
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,365
- I know you lied to me.
- Not that.

488
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,810
Harvey never assigned me to your case.

489
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,403
I did it because you left our home
and you came here,

490
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,842
and all I can think
every time I look at you

491
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,644
is how sorry I am.

492
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,561
And the reason I want you
to leave me alone

493
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,648
is all I can think when I look at you,

494
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,726
is him.

495
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,331
Then why did you come back?

496
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,447
I was drowning.
And Louis threw me a lifeline.

497
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,210
I'm your lifeline, too.

498
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,848
A lifeline? You're the one
that threw me overboard.

499
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,287
- Mike.
- Why did it have to be him?

500
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,047
I don't need you
to keep telling me that you're sorry,

501
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,845
or to be charming, or anything else.

502
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,686
I just need to get that image
out of my head.

503
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,970
- Did you get it?
- No.

504
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,844
Little heads up would have been nice.

505
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,009
- I don't exactly have a backup plan.
- Well, good thing I do.

506
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,326
What are you talking about?

507
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,841
It doesn't matter whether
we have proof of our theory or not.

508
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,928
It just matters whether
or not our theory is true.

509
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,361
You typed up a fake list?

510
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,046
- Exactly, brilliant.
- It would have been a little more brilliant

511
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,810
if you didn't get here at the last second.

512
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,287
It wouldn't work if it doesn't look real,
and that takes time.

513
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,171
- Okay. Just give it to me.

Mike, why don't you tell him
what's on there?

Oh, he knows what's on there
and what's not on there,

that make any evidence

Did you want to tell him, or should we?

Your Honor, I'm formally withdrawing
my request to go through their files.

533

that signature isn't fabricated?

Go ahead. Give Mr. Sanders a call.
He'll tell you it's true.

I guess it's going to be sooner.

- What's that?
- It's 50 different ways

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,645
we can stop Sean Cahill in his tracks.

00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,325
- Why did you...
- I told you.

An attack on one of us
is an attack on all of us.

coming after him, he is coming after me.

Louis, it doesn't matter.
There's nothing we can do about it.

00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,250
What do you mean there's
nothing we can do about it?

554

- That's it.
- Thank God. We're in the clear.

558
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,250
Louis, one second ago you said that an
attack on Harvey was an attack on you.

559
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,964
Yeah, yeah. And you just said
there's nothing we can do about it.

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,487
- But that doesn't make it a good thing.
- Doesn't it?

Mike, did you collude
with Harvey or not?

- Of course I didn't.
- That's exactly my point.

00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,720
So as far as I'm concerned,
this matter is done.

You never should have cut
that man loose as a client.

Well, I cut him loose

584
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,411
because I knew he was the kind of
person who would do what he just did.

585
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,161
Bullshit. You cut him loose because you
knew Mike Ross was coming back here.

Well, you're damn right I did and
I'm not going to apologize for it.

You should have
discussed it with me first.

forgiveness than permission.

589
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,281
Forgiveness?

590
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,648
You just said you're not
going to apologize for it.

591
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,642
You know what? I'm not.

592

his company brought in.

going back over two decades?

00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,364
I don't give a shit if it's $100 million.

which clients we keep? I'm happy to.

either going to back me or you're not.

I told you I needed some time.

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,168
And then you told me that you needed
to get that image out of your head.

608
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,001
- Which is why I need...
- No. No, it isn't.

get it out of your head.

- Tess.
- Yes, Tess.

611
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:44,441
And my image isn't made up
and it wasn't of two people kissing.

612
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,645
But I got over it without
getting rid of it, because

You knew how I felt about him.

You knew what it would
do to me and you did it anyway.

Well, I wouldn't know.

can tell me what it's like to be a loser.

stating that we have everything

637
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,360
and if I find nothing, he's going
to file malicious prosecution charges.

638
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,609
Actually, Sean, I'm filing
those charges right now.

in the contents of everything
you've ever asked for,

641

this bullshit search becomes exhibit A.

642
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,283
Your Honor, he has no basis
to file that action.

threat of malicious prosecution or not?

What's the matter, Sean?
Afraid you won't find anything?

647
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,725
Just give me the files.

00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,489
You wanted to see me?

00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,128

where credit is due.

- Yes.

And when he finds nothing,
we'll be done with him.

- Thank you.

you didn't want to.

655
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,649
Would you have wanted to
if you were me?

656
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,325
I did just come up with that fix.

657
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,681
A fix for Cahill coming after you
for colluding with Harvey.

658
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,045
A problem I never would have had
if I'd never met you.

659
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,846
Why did you call me down here?

660
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,440
I want to know why the hell
you came back.

661
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,886
It's funny, if you'd asked me
that this morning,

662
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,446
I would have said
it's because I had no place else to go.

663
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,769
I didn't ask you this morning.
I'm asking you now.

664
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,803
Then it doesn't matter why I came back.

665
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,007
What matters is that I'm staying,
because this is where I belong.

666
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,603
- Hey, just the person I was looking for.
- You heard?

667
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,008
I heard that I just booked a plane ticket
to Boston to surprise Sheila,

668
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,770
and I need you to cover
the McBain hearing tomorrow.

669
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,408
Louis, the McBain hearing is
the least of our worries.

670
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,010
What do you mean?

671
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,724
Harvey went to court this morning

672
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,047
and agreed to hand
over every single document

673
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,770
on the Gillie takeover.

674
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,723
- Including Forstman.
- What?

675
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,207
Why would he...

676
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,482
Because he thinks
we have nothing to hide.

677
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,810
Shit.

678
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,767
Then it's only a matter of time before
I'm marched out of here in handcuffs.

679
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,081
I'm not going to let it
come to that.

680
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,690
Oh, how the hell are you
going to stop it?

681
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,241
By replacing one document
with another.

682
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,451
- I am not framing Harvey.
- This isn't framing Harvey.

683
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,011
- It's freeing you.
- What are you talking about?

684
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,009
This makes it look
like Forstman's payment

685
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,770
never went to any offshore accounts,

686
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,360
- and that you never took a piece of it.
- But that's forgery.

687
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,441
Which is less of a crime
than what you did.

688
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,365
- I didn't ask you to do this.
- Then don't use it.

689
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,007
But you're the one who said
that if we give them those files,

690
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,281
it's only a matter of time.

691
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,731
Louis,

692
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,727
Cahill's looking for dirt on Harvey
and Mike, not you and Forstman.

693
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,890
He won't even give this
a second glance.

694
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,604
But if he does,
it puts Harvey in jeopardy

695
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,082
and I might as well frame him,
just like Forstman wanted me to.

696
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,164
Then you have a decision to make,

697
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,681
because they're turning
everything over first thing tomorrow.

698
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,290
Louis, is everything okay?

699
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,322
Everything's...
Everything's fine, Mike.

700
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,767
Donna.

701
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,961
What can I do for you, Harvey?

702
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,368
Everything taken care of
for the file transfer tomorrow?

703
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,648
It was taken care of
20 minutes before you asked for it.

704
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,808
Great. Here's Howard,
Miller and Klein.

705
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,285
I'd like to get a jump
on these right now.

706
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,966
Oh, it's late, Harvey. We've had
a long day. Maybe we can just...

707
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,289
Come on, we can order from
that shitty Thai place you love.

708
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,609
- Knock this out in two hours.
- Is that an order or a request?

709
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,967
- What are you...
- I have a date tonight, Harvey.

710
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,170
So unless you think we're going to lose
Howard, Miller or Klein, I'm leaving.

711
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,206
- Have a good night.
- Thanks, Harvey.

712
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,881
- Don't forget to use protection.
- Stop right there.

713
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,844
Oh, so when I go out with someone,
you can give me all the shit in the world

714
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,804
- but when you do?
- Yeah. That's exactly how it works.

715
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,406
Get used to it.

716
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,162
What's wrong with you?
You look like you just saw a ghost.

717
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,770
I feel like I did.

718
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,370
- I think we have a problem.
- What do you mean?

719
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,686
We just took step number one

720
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,609
to finally putting
this Cahill bullshit behind us.

721
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,882
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
I don't think it is behind us.

722
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,967
What?

723
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:33,010
I don't know what Louis did,
but I think he did something wrong.

724
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,208
- What are you talking about?
- When he came to me yesterday,

725
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,891
he was chomping
at the bit to help fight Cahill.

726
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,441
That's Louis. He'd take a bullet
for this firm. You know that.

727
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,050
Then why did he immediately
change his tune

728
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,243
after I told him that Logan was only
releasing our communications?

729
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,282
- He seemed relieved?
- He seemed ecstatic.

730
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,882
And before that, he was pissed
that I was working on your stuff,

731
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,321
until he found out
it was to fight Cahill.

732
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,923
What exactly are you thinking
he might have done?

733
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,690
I don't know exactly.

734
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,282
But, I think he cut some
sort of deal with Forstman.

735
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,569
- He did cut a deal with Forstman.
- I'm talking about an illegal deal.

736
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,763
Mike, I know Forstman's a snake,
but this is Louis you're talking about.

737
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,884
Yeah, I know. But you weren't there
when he made me that offer.

738
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,604
I'd never seen him like that.

739
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,769
He was desperate to keep me
from working for that man.

740
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,847
- Mike...
- And on top of that,

741
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,207
I found out what he gave up
to get me back here.

742
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,010
Sheila.

743
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,403
But why would he care
about us handing over everything

744
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,002
if he didn't care about
the communication just between us?

745
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,043
Because if he did make
a dirty deal with Forstman,

746
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,685
it wouldn't have been
in those documents,

747
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,928
it would have been
in the other documents.

748
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,330
The documents we just told the court
we're happy to turn over.

749
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,886
What are you going to do?

750
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,048
I'm going to find out
what the hell Louis did.

751
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,410
Go home, Mike.
There's nothing you can do tonight.

752
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,846
(SINGING) This is a song about
somebody else

753
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,971
So don't worry yourself,
worry yourself

754
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,766
The devil 3 right there,
right there in the details

755
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,527
And you don't wanna
hurt yourself, hurt yourself

756
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,690
By looking too closely

757
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,801
By looking too closely

758
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,770
No, H0, no, no

759
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,686
Put your arms
around somebody else

760
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,209
And don't punish yourself,
punish yourself

761
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,408
The truth is like blood
underneath your fingernails

762
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,241
You don't wanna hurt
yourself, hurt yourself

763
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,848
By looking too closely

764
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,801
By looking too closely

765
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,121
No, H0, no, no

766
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,607
No, H0, no, no

767
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,890
No, H0, no, no

768
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,850
I made a huge mistake.

769
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,327
<i>(SINGING) And I could be wrong
about anybody else</i>

770
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,680
So don't kid yourself,
kid yourself

771
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,888
By looking too close

772
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,804
Mmm, mmm, mmm
