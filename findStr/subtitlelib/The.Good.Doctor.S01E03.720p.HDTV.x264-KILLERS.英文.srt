20
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,970
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,970
How hard can it be to just act like a normal human being?

22
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,070
No!

23
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,400
Will you stop petting that stupid rabbit?!

24
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,200
We're never going home again.

25
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,090
We have each other, and that's all we need.

26
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,160
Your fiancé sure can handle a knife.

27
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,880
He's got a serious deficit.

28
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,620
So, are you proud or disappointed?

29
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,650
Marcus, stop making everything so personal.

30
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,150
You've wanted his job since day one.

31
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,460
Everyone in this room knows that.

32
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,670
- How did you... - It's my department.

33
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,140
It's my job to know everything.

34
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,440
Since I work for you, 

35
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,390
doesn't that make all this actually your fault?

36
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,270
Oh, I'm sorry. I stopped listening after "I work for you".

37
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,440
A surgeon needs to communicate. 

38
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
Can Dr. Murphy do that? Can he do that under stress?

39
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,950
Can he do that knowing that a human life

40
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,740
literally hangs in the balance?

41
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,640
So, I'm in the middle of "Uncharted", and I'm dead.

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,320
Can I borrow some triple A's?

43
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,370
I'm your neighbor.

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,840
Hello.

45
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,710
34?

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,090
I moved in last week. 33.

47
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,100
Yeah, I know.

48
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,660
I work at a hospital.

49
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,140
That's cool.

50
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,160
Yes.

51
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,470
Triple A's, por favor?

52
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,140
Batteries.

53
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,090
Right.

54
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,590
Do you have any?

55
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,450
Triple A batteries.

56
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,650
Thank you.

57
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,030
Piece of advice -- don't feed the cat.

58
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,930
Which cat?

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,210
Feed it once, and it'll never leave you alone.

60
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,520
Thank you for the batteries, neighbor.

61
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,040
You're welcome!

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,210
Surgical.

63
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,440
Well, you're in luck because I'm not a nurse,

64
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,760
I'm a surgical resident.

65
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,870
How can I help you?

66
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,710
We got a liver for Chuck!

67
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,250
- Where? - SF Municipal Hospital!

68
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,340
And how long do we have body-to-body on the liver transplant?

69
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,030
- Eight hours. - Eight hours.

70
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,230
You don't know the longevity of a liver?

71
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,850
This is a teaching hospital, and I'm the teacher.

72
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,760
You and Murphy, you're on organ pick-up.

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,220
Check the health and bring the liver back from SFM.

74
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,310
I was at Chuck's intake. I'd really like to be --

75
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,230
Now you're gonna be at the intake for his new liver.

76
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,820
Jared, get Chuck down here and get him prepped.

77
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,830
We got eight hours on this thing,

78
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,410
and the clock starts ticking now.

79
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,950
Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please.

80
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,170
Dr. Bender.

81
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,430
I'm not interrupting your pre-game, am I?

82
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,480
I think this is my 400th breast reconstruction.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,750
The board should give me a plaque.

84
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:04,560
What's up?

85
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,150
Your 4:00 P.M.

86
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,430
The V.I.P. -- Wannamaker.

87
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,720
Yes! The Free-Flap.

88
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,380
He's checked into the penthouse suite, resting comfortably I'm sure.

89
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,650
I've been working on him for awhile now, and he's close.

90
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,310
He's real close to making the Foundation his tax relief.

91
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,360
That's good to hear.

92
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,800
I want aces on this.

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,460
Everything perfect.

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,320
That's good to know. I was gonna phone it in.

95
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,130
Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please.

96
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,940
Dr. Bender.

97
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,280
Is this the chairman's version of a pep talk?

98
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,290
I'm looking for a fail-safe outcome on the procedure.

99
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,440
I want you to use Dr. Melendez as your second.

100
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,520
That's your fail-safe? Melendez?

101
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm your Chief of Surgery.

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,240
It's just a precaution to guarantee a perfect outcome.

103
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,520
Are you doubting my abilities?

104
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,220
Wannamaker is important.

105
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,760
Everything has to be perfect.

106
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,190
You said that already.

107
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,920
I'm your fail-safe.

108
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,680
The V.I.P. will be fine.

109
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
How you doing?

110
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,910
I know these sounds and everything might be a lot for you.

111
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,720
It's -- it's hard for anyone.

112
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,080
I like helicopters.

113
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,290
I, uh, didn't know you'd been on a helicopter.

114
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,120
I haven't.

116
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,960
15 minutes to San Francisco Municipal Hospital.

117
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,170
Should be a smooth ride.

118
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,030
You do know what this is, right?

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,260
Well, I'll tell you what it is. It's scut work.

120
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,140
Jared gets the golden ticket, and we get...

121
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,980
pizza delivery.

122
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,460
The rotors just go round and round, Shaun.

123
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,760
They don't change.

124
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,420
How do I talk to you?

125
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,940
So, Chuck, any chest pains, shortness of breath?

126
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,640
No.

127
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,450
Any alcohol in the last six months?

128
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,070
No.

129
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,670
-Here comes a quick pinch. -Any swelling in your limbs?

130
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,600
It's Walmart on Black Friday in here.

131
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,110
Things speed way up - when you're having a transplant.

132
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,050
I like it.

133
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:02,380
It's good energy.

134
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,180
So, that's a "No" on the swelling?

135
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,090
No.

136
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,140
I feel lousy all the time, pretty much.

137
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,300
But...I've got a second chance, you know, with this liver.

138
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,050
Sure.

139
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,610
Excuse me. It's my daughter.

140
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,540
I already spoke to Mom.

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,010
A-And Uncle Tommy, too.

142
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,340
Yeah, I need to see your face.

143
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,230
All right.

144
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,600
I love you.

145
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,660
Bye.

146
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,700
She just graduated from law school at Cal.

147
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,000
I told you that.

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Uh, no. Congratulations.

149
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,040
I must've told Dr. Browne, then.

150
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,490
Where is Dr. Browne?

152
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,880
Here's your liver.

153
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,180
I'm going to need you to sign for it.

154
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,340
Standard operating procedure is to leave the liver 

155
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,410
in the safety of the body cavity.

156
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,770
I'm aware of the procedure.

157
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,840
We had a John Doe - at the top of the registry,

158
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,930
but that John Doe died before we could plant.

159
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,460
How long ago did you take it out?

160
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,370
Three hours.

161
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,280
We just lost three hours.

162
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,580
Technically three hours and five minutes.

163
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,490
True clock is on the cooler.

164
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,430
Can't go below 39 degrees or above 47 degrees.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,010
You want to sign for it?

166
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,930
Tissue looks healthy.

167
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,580
What are you doing?

168
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,330
What are you looking for?

169
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,470
-What's he doing? - I'm not sure.

171
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,900
{\an1}Shaun, what are you looking for?

172
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,560
{\an1}Masses? Cysts?

173
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,500
They're clean.

174
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,200
You think we'd miss a tumor?

175
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,570
There's nothing there.

176
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,020
I know.

177
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,570
There's nothing there.

178
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,140
Okay, the liver needs to go back into cold storage,

179
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,190
and we got to go.

181
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,660
...then I'll release the vascular clamp

182
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,800
and let your blood perfuse in your donor liver.

183
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,460
- That's it? - Connect the bile ducts,

184
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,020
sew you up, and then we wait.

185
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,270
Does the new one always take?

186
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,020
Over 70% of the time.

187
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,600
Oh, I can live with those odds.

188
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,290
You get some rest.

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,500
See you later.

190
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,790
He looks at something. I don't know what he's looking at.

191
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,640
Is he, you know, is -- is he curious?

192
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,310
Is he concerned? He won't answer me.

193
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,350
You're having trouble communicating with him.

194
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,220
It's a weekday. It's Shaun.

195
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,070
Hm, let's see. That seems about right.

196
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,960
He seemed different at the hospital.

197
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,840
I could kind of talk to him.

198
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,280
Well, he knows what to expect in the hospital.

199
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,030
Outside, everything's different. Everything's new.

200
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,020
New stimuli.

201
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,380
So, what do I do? I-I...

202
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,490
I don't know what he's thinking.

203
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,740
Claire, you're not gonna figure out what he's thinking,

204
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,850
so don't even try.

205
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,950
In fact, if he's thinking about something in his own mind,

206
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,950
just let him be.

207
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,130
I'd appreciate it if people gave me the same courtesy.

208
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,610
I thought with your history --

209
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,400
Claire, if you want to connect with him,

210
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,710
you're gonna have to figure out your own way in.

211
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:53,960
How's Chuck?

212
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,940
Chuck? Chuck's fine.

213
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,630
He's waiting for a liver.

214
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,070
So come home, please.

215
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:58,900
Okay.

216
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,780
Doctor.

217
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,510
- What's up? - I just wanted to thank you.

218
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,080
I haven't done anything yet.

219
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,230
You have.

220
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,160
You've given my dad hope.

222
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,610
{\an3}You know, Chuck was my first patient.

223
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,870
Six months ago, - first day at St. Bonaventure,

224
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,260
I get a liver failure.

225
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,110
And the nicest guy in the world.

226
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,000
I wanted to be the one to give him the good news.

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,350
We're not leaving.

228
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,370
You said you liked helicopters.

229
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,620
We are not leaving.

230
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,050
We -- We made it here safe.

231
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,420
Yes, we are not leaving.

232
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,530
We're not leaving.

233
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,830
Fog's rolling in too quick.

234
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,220
Does that mean it rolls out quick?

235
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,860
Could be an hour. Could be three.

236
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,790
Don't know.

237
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,480
Okay, uh... We're gonna need a new ride.

239
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,710
{\an3}Excuse me! 

240
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:59,520
{\an3}I need an ambulance to St. Bonaventure.

241
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,170
Sorry. I just don't have the EMS.

242
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,510
I've got a pile-up on I-80 

243
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,860
and four other vehicles out on call.

244
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,480
Not one ambulance?

245
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,680
Let me be clear -- this is emergent.

246
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,720
It's time sensitive.

247
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,170
Honey, this ain't Hertz.

248
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,840
What about a police escort?

249
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,360
That can be arranged.

250
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,020
Of course.

251
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,120
Don't want to ruin the festivities.

252
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,130
But if I could just get a few minutes with my patient, alone.

253
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,230
Mr. Wannamaker.

254
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,820
Dr. Andrews.

255
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,250
How we doing today?

256
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,810
Incomplete.

257
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,290
Let's see what we can do about that.

258
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,370
Look here.

259
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,240
Well, looking not too bad considering we cut out a tumor

260
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,780
less than two weeks ago.

261
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,570
Yeah, I've been walking around with a hole in my mouth.

262
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,470
Ever drink Scotch with a hole in your mouth?

263
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,750
Waste of good Scotch.

264
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,410
We needed to give it time to heal.

265
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,210
Yeah, yeah. You told me.

266
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,430
Have you continued to smoke?

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,800
It constricts the vessels, slows the healing.

268
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,710
I'm not a quitter.

269
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,730
We are going to graft some skin from your leg

270
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,280
and fix that cheek up better than new.

271
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,160
I'm a real estate guy.

272
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,660
There's an old saying -- "You can have it fast.

273
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,670
You can have it good. You can have it cheap. Pick two."

274
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,850
It's not gonna be cheap.

275
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,040
I like doctors like you.

276
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,660
You're good, and you know it.

278
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,220
{\an3}Yes. It was harvested before we got there.

279
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,770
We're waiting for transportation.

280
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,330
The itinerary and the life clock have changed.

281
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,130
Yeah, uh... Four hours and 14 minutes.

282
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,780
Excuse me! Are you talking to the hospital?

283
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,400
Have someone tell - Dr. Glassman 

284
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,360
that I might be late for our lunch, please.

285
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,760
Yeah.

286
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,560
Okay.

287
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,270
So, how did you know about the weather?

288
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,990
Is it some kind of gift?

289
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,280
Come on, I got to know.

290
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,380
What, Shaun Murphy is Zeus?

291
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,740
I watch The Weather Channel.

292
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,000
You my doctors?

293
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,180
Shaun?

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,230
Shaun, we got to go!

295
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,900
You're home.

296
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,230
Your dad and mom have had a tough night with your brother and all.

297
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,770
Come on. Let's go.

298
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,740
No! No!

299
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,740
He -- He promised me!

300
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,210
He...He promised me!

301
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:19,720
He promised! He promised me!

302
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,630
He promised me! He promised me!

303
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,500
I think we'll get there much quicker if we drive, Shaun.

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
C-Could you turn off the flashers, please?

305
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,610
What's the patient's name?

306
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,910
I told you. It's Chuck.

307
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,550
- No. - No?

308
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,210
No. The -- The donor?

309
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,420
What's his name?

310
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,660
What? The liver?

311
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,490
I...

312
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,170
"Oliver"?

313
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,090
Oliver.

314
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,690
Hey, you got a second?

315
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,530
What's up?

316
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,730
Just waiting on a liver.

317
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,430
Transplant. Everyone wants in.

318
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,870
They'd trade their liver to do the liver.

319
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,000
Hey, look, uh, you want some help on this Free-Flap?

320
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:31,910
What's his name?

321
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,370
Wannamaker.

322
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,690
You got the transplant.

323
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,650
That should keep any attending busy.

324
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,100
Well, I can make time.

325
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,290
Aoki come to you about this?

326
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,800
Look, I get it. You're the Chief.

327
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,820
That's right.

328
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,460
Look, this -- this isn't a coup.

329
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,490
What is it?

330
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,860
It's about making sure this hospital is first

331
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,610
on Wannamaker's donation list.

332
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,280
I'm aware of the stakes.

333
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,050
Thanks for coming by.

334
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,400
You know, it doesn't make you any less of a surgeon,

335
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,860
having me in there as your second.

336
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm the Chief. You're my attending.

337
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,620
Can't argue with that.

338
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,580
And we both know what your presence in my O.R. will say.

339
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,830
That's not my intention.

340
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,940
It's the impact. Intention doesn't matter.

341
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,030
Thanks...but I'm good.

342
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,340
These can't be right.

343
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,140
Whatever it is, it's right.

344
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,150
Chuck's labs.

345
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,510
It's got to be a false flag or a bad reading.

346
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,430
For what?

347
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,580
Medications? Foods? I don't know.

348
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,690
Look, if this is right, we lose our transplant.

349
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,690
I'm sorry. That doesn't change the results.

350
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,000
There's alcohol in his system.

351
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,560
He drank.

352
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,100
The blood doesn't lie.

353
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,290
Run the lab again.

355
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,850
{\an3}E.T.A. To St. Bonaventure?

356
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,090
70 minutes.

357
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,310
What are you looking for?

358
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,130
What do you see?

359
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,470
I have a girl neighbor.

360
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,040
Okay.

361
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,360
Is she nice?

362
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,750
What does she do? - Does she...have a boyfriend?

363
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,220
Do you know her name?

364
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,290
What the hell are you looking for on the scans?

365
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,610
What the...

366
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,230
The temperature is going up!

367
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,030
Officer, we need to find a place with ice, like, now!

368
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,350
I tested it, Chuck. And re-tested it.

369
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,340
Talk to me. You know the six-month rule.

370
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,420
- Was it a craving? - It was three days ago.

371
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,960
My daughter's graduation.

372
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,440
Nobody in my family had ever gone to college.

373
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,100
There she was.

374
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,140
My little girl wearing the robes.

375
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:27,330
And for just that day, I...I wanted to be normal.

376
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,340
So, I...I had a glass of champagne.

378
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,180
You're out of ice?

379
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,590
It's broken. Supermarket's about three miles down.

380
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,710
We don't have time.

381
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,390
Okay. Okay.

382
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,470
The temperature's already at 47 degrees.

383
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,000
We can't let it go any higher.

384
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,890
Are you gonna help me?

385
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,220
It's sweet. You'll like it.

386
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,480
What should I do with him?

387
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,700
Child Services is down in Cheyenne.

388
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,060
That's 150 miles, and they'll just turn me around

389
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,740
and send me back to the parents.

390
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,470
The parents don't want him?

391
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,710
I don't know.

392
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,720
He doesn't seem to want the parents, that's for sure.

393
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,100
You can take him to do the hospital.

394
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,410
Social worker there.

395
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,500
That won't work.

396
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,760
How do you know?

397
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,990
Shaun?

398
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,080
You're right. It's not working! Why?

399
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,830
Shaun!

400
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,710
Are you even listening to me?!

401
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,960
Just one drink?

402
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,150
That's what he said.

403
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,270
Should I inform the registry?

404
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,850
How long ago - did Chuck have that drink?

405
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,930
Three days ago.

406
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,010
Give me your marker.

407
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,840
That's...

408
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,650
Estimated blood-alcohol content.

409
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,330
What type of alcohol?

410
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,920
Uh, champagne.

411
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,580
What percentage of alcohol is that?

412
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,650
I don't know. What's the difference?

413
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,020
Take out your phone and look it up.

414
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,800
I don't know why it's not working!

415
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,930
It needs to be submerged to cool.

416
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,830
Every five seconds is an XL.

417
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,650
Why did you answer me the last time, but not before?

418
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,690
Was it because I was angry?

419
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,290
Was it random?

420
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,260
Why can't you answer my questions?

421
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,680
This better work.

422
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,850
It will work.

423
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,750
You answer when I don't ask.

424
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,140
You don't like questions.

425
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,310
I don't.

426
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,940
I didn't do well in calculus.

427
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,230
This is algebra.

428
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,310
With his severe cirrhosis,

429
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,400
his alcohol-clearance rate is one milligram per deciliter per hour.

430
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,700
One drink, say eight ounces...

431
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,300
If it's champagne, six ounces, tops.

432
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,310
Play it conservative.

433
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,460
Eight ounces results in a blood alcohol level

434
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,060
of 39 milligrams per deciliter.

435
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,590
One standard drink.

436
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,170
Now, the purpose of abstinence,

437
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,610
at least according to the transplant registry is...

438
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,530
Patients who kill their livers due to excessive drinking

439
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,720
prove they can be sober.

440
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,000
Let me see that report.

441
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,630
0.02

442
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,890
Chuck was telling the truth.

443
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,770
He did have just the one drink.

444
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,990
He didn't fall off the wagon.

445
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,870
Corporate loves its data.

446
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,360
I'm not sure it'll actually make a difference,

447
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,700
but it does give us an argument.

448
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,550
You are a genius.

449
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,070
You don't like the cafeteria food?

450
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,180
They only make one thing well.

451
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,610
What does it say when the staff sees

452
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,680
the President of the hospital not eating their cafeteria food?

453
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,030
Well, it says the President of the hospital

454
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,590
isn't allowed in the kitchen.

455
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,470
You sat down. What can I do for you?

456
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,560
I'd like your advice.

457
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,330
Really?

458
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,650
Where's Aoki? Did she die?

459
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,890
This was a mistake.

460
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,420
That's insulting. Sit down.

461
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,000
At least hear what I have to say,

462
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,900
and then decide it's bad advice.

463
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,810
Sit.

464
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:24,070
Aoki is pushing Melendez on me for the VIP.

465
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,870
You didn't get the e-mail blast.

466
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,470
Rich people aren't allowed to die in this hospital.

467
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:30,230
You're not the young star anymore.

468
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,380
Melendez is.

469
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,580
I know that.

470
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,210
And you're upset about the "Why"?

471
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,370
Why does Aoki think that?

472
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,580
You should be asking "Who".

473
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,840
"Who"? I know who. Melendez.

474
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,830
Who are you?

475
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,630
Are you a Chief who wants to be top surgeon,

476
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,760
or are you a Chief who wants to be president?

477
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,900
'Cause if it's the latter, take your ego,

478
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,730
shove it in a cupboard somewhere,

479
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,790
and start acting presidential.

480
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,020
Dr. Melendez is going to argue to the board

481
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,980
that you get this liver.

482
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,610
And I think it's a pretty good argument.

483
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,040
Do I deserve it?

484
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,230
I'm... not sure that's relevant.

485
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,580
You know...

486
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,610
when you're dying,

487
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,810
and I've been dying for a long time,

488
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,150
you start to think about your life.

489
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,340
I haven't led a great one.

490
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,720
I could've been a better dad.

491
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,020
A better man.

492
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,550
News flash, I drank too much.

493
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,160
You know, I also have a son.

494
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,310
Yeah. First marriage.

495
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,910
I haven't seen him in three years.

496
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,010
Getting a liver is not a second chance,

497
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,310
and it's not a reward for being perfect.

498
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,230
It's just what we can do.

499
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:01,900
Maybe.

500
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,210
But on the registry,

501
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,200
all of us wait in line together.

502
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,490
And I see these ...

503
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,500
these people here, waiting.

504
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,780
I know their faces.

505
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,190
Even their names.

506
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,090
They all have stories.

507
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,870
We're in it together.

508
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,660
And I...

509
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,790
I broke the...

510
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,790
Chuck? Chuck!

511
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,590
Chuck? Code blue!

512
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,940
Chuck, can you hear me?

513
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,080
He's got blood in his esophagus.

514
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,740
He's got a variceal bleed.

515
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,440
All right. Saline wide open. Type and cross four units.

516
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,240
I'm going to band the vein.

517
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,040
Pressure's coming up.

518
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,580
- Chuck had a variceal bleed. - I was in there.

519
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,950
Portal hypertension, decompensated...

520
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:42,840
Are you finished?

521
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,050
He's got three months to live, maybe.

522
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,540
You have to be six-months alcohol free

523
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,110
before you're registry eligible.

524
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,250
And you said you weren't good at math.

525
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,460
He gets this one or he dies.

527
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,940
You know what this thing looks like at 8:00 A.M.?

528
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,370
I need a police escort to work every  morning.

529
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,880
280 South.

530
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,530
Where are all roads meet.

532
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,910
No, they don't!

533
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,040
- What's wrong with him? - He's autistic, officer.

534
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,130
What's that mean?

535
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,360
Does he need to be in a hospital?

536
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,740
The last place he should be is a hospital.

537
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,900
What are you doing?

538
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:04,940
Shaun?

539
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,740
What are you thinking?

540
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,000
Okay, this isn't a question.

541
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,160
I just...I don't know what you're looking for, Shaun.

542
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,510
Yes, I can feel it. It's firmer.

543
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,390
And?

544
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:24,830
I don't know what that means.

545
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,970
There must be a clot, but there isn't a clot.

546
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,740
The scan showed no clot.

547
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,000
That's because the scans were taken before

548
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,200
they harvested the liver.

549
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,000
Prior to the liver being flushed with UW solution!

550
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,070
It's dying!

551
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,980
To preserve the liver, they replace all its blood

552
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,690
with a solution to protect it from the cold storage,

553
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,920
but they must've left some blood behind, which clotted.

554
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,480
How long to St. Bonaventure?

555
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
- Less than 30 minutes. - Can't wait!

556
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,020
We have to immediately remove the clot and flush the left lobe

557
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,420
to protect it from the ice bath.

558
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,740
We need to stop the car.

559
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,990
- Here? - Yes. Yes.

560
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,000
We need to operate right here, right now.

561
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,680
Flush this from the right.

562
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:21,330
So, the left lobe,

563
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,220
starting at the middle hepatic vein.

564
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,410
Less intrusive cut would be along the falciform ligament

565
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,160
to allow access to Segment III.

566
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,350
When you locate the blockage, I'm gonna have to remove it.

567
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,990
I need a straw to cannulate the vein, please.

568
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,500
There's a straw in my cup.

569
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,660
UW solution will stabilize the cell walls.

570
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,670
Preserve the integrity of the organ.

571
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,320
This is better than having a baby in my car.

572
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,290
How are you feeling?

573
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,250
Like I'm writing a blank check.

574
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,480
You're gonna be fine.

575
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,350
You're the best.

576
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,350
This bleed, these varices -- this isn't good news.

577
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,710
Tells us that your liver failure has progressed considerably.

578
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:01,810
How much?

579
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,880
You have two to three months.

580
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,980
We're getting - the liver today, in an hour.

581
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,920
I don't get it.

582
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,650
You didn't tell them.

583
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,580
What?

584
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:13,930
Your father had a drink.

585
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,060
He had one glass.

586
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,990
Transplant registry doesn't quantify things like that.

587
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,310
So he doesn't get the liver?

588
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,950
I'm gonna try and get it for him.

589
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,470
What are you, a car salesman?

590
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,730
What, you're gonna try?

591
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,850
The final decision is out of my hands.

592
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,670
And if you fail?

593
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,010
I'm gonna do everything that I can.

594
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,320
I am meeting with - the committee in 10 minutes.

595
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,460
Excuse me.

596
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:50,500
{\an1}BGM: American Honey by Lady Antebellum

597
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:52,340
I handed my dad the drink.

598
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,430
Doesn't matter how it happened.

599
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,110
He didn't want it. He just wanted to make me happy.

600
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,070
If you let him die, I will have killed my father.

601
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,290
It was a glass.

602
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,090
A glass of champagne at his daughter's graduation.

603
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,400
I have the labs to prove it.

604
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,840
Chuck didn't fall off the wagon.

605
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,460
He had one drink and never went back.

606
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,590
The transplant registry guidelines don't play

607
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,070
in the gray for a reason.

608
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,480
Those guidelines are so arbitrary.

609
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,730
Have one drink and you die.

610
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,680
A couple pills of ecstasy, no problem.

611
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,270
Hepatitis B from careless sexual practice, nope.

612
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,510
Nothing at all about that.

613
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,450
So, what do you want us to do? Throw out the rules?

614
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,220
I want us not to hide behind them.

615
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,440
We do have a responsibility.

616
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,520
Without the rules, we're playing God.

617
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,510
We need the rules.

618
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,090
Does that help you sleep better at night?

619
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,370
Yes, it does.

620
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,780
We have one liver today, and 800 people in this state need it.

621
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,960
I don't want to be haunted by the other 799.

622
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,320
Your guy hasn't earned it.

623
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,000
He knew the rules, and this...

624
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,560
it's a technicality.

625
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,340
No, the drink is a technicality.

626
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,220
Jessica, what's the legal burden here?

627
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,150
Significant.

628
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,100
If we move forward with this transplant,

629
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,850
we could lose privileges from the registry.

630
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,900
-If it were discovered. -If it were discovered?

631
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,060
How narrow can you be about this?

632
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,440
Dr. Glassman, where are you on this?

633
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,560
I can make a good argument either way.

634
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,890
Go ahead, please.

635
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,430
Better to remove - the arguments all together.

636
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,190
What the hell is he talking about?

637
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,320
All I'm talking about is that we have a patient

638
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,430
in this hospital who needs a liver.

639
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,710
We also just happen to have a liver that needs a patient.

640
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,620
It's not that simple.

641
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,800
It is that simple if you consider the patient.

642
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,810
Rules are secondary.

643
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,540
But is saving this patient worth the risk

644
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,510
of not being able - to save hundreds of others?

645
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,600
I don't have hundreds of patients right now.

646
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,880
I have one, and his name is Chuck.

647
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,180
Blood pressure's steady.

648
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,000
Donor vessel to the facial artery,

649
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,520
and we're ready to close him up.

650
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,910
10-0 polypropylene and vascular forceps.

651
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,540
Nice work, Dr. Andrews.

652
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,050
What do we have here?

653
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,160
hematoma?

654
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,270
I can see that. Let's find its source.

655
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,910
Sponge, stick, and probe.

656
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,240
Sponge, stick, and probe.

657
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,950
It's not my recipient artery.

658
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,190
Heart rate is dropping.

659
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,090
Whatever it is, - it's compressing his carotid.

660
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,720
I can't get deep enough here. I need better access.

661
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,120
We move through zone three from the outside.

662
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,280
Zone three's a minefield.

663
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,270
I'm aware, but we need to do this.

664
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,930
Whatever you're gonna do, do it quick.

665
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,810
It's strangling him from the inside.

666
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,340
Get me Melendez.

668
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,170
We made it!

669
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,300
Yeah, we're here.

670
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,720
Downstairs, coming up.

671
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,020
No, no, no. Jared, you're not gonna believe wh--

672
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,090
Yeah?

673
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,740
Got it.

674
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,920
Chuck's been moved to the bottom of the list.

675
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,720
San Jose Presbyterian are coming to get the liver.

676
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,990
-Oxygen sats tanking. -Up him to 100 % O2.

677
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,380
You have to go through the mandible from the inside

678
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,460
to probe for the source. It's the only way.

679
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,230
Loupes.

680
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,910
We have to be careful in there, or he'll get a stroke.

681
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,210
We'll just have to be careful then.

682
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,580
Give Dr. Melendez - the mandibular channel retractor

683
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,670
and number five bone cutter.

684
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,970
number five bone cutter.

685
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,370
29 minutes. That's a lifetime.

686
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,040
Thank you. This is amazing.

687
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,560
Got to go. The whole team is waiting.

688
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,380
His name is Oliver.

689
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,530
It was a good day.

690
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,080
We saved a life...

691
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,130
just not Chuck's.
