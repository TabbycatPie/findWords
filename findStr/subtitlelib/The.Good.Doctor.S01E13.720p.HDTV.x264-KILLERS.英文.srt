42
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,640
- I was late! - It's okay, sweetie. It's not your fault.

43
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,270
I just wanted to play one more game at Gary's.

44
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,730
Well, you did great. You called 911 right away.

45
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,480
- He looked dead. - Daddy's not dead.

46
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,990
He's gonna be okay, right?

47
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,720
- He had a stroke. - That's not possible!

48
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,600
Well, the CT confirmed a ruptured aneurysm.

49
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,110
We have to operate to clip the bleeding

50
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,080
and reduce intracranial pressure.

51
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,930
No, he had a stroke six years ago.

52
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,500
They put him on diltiazem.

53
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,860
We're gonna take good care of your dad.

54
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,960
Naja Modi -- 28 years old, suffered a burn to her left hand

55
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,090
as a result of a cooking accident.

56
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,140
Are Jared and I being punished?

57
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,200
This is not a very interesting case, is it?

58
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,290
Lesson one --

59
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,730
Don't suggest to the the head of surgery

60
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,910
that working with the head of surgery

61
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,170
is form of punishment.

62
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,980
Dr. Melendez is very unhappy with Jared

63
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,660
for how he got his job back.

64
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,140
And Dr. Melendez is unhappy with me for t-taking --

65
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,690
taking two days off.

66
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,390
I don't think he wants to talk about this, Shaun.

67
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,000
I was an idiot.

68
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,700
It's on the stove. Of course it's hot, right?

69
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,120
You wouldn't believe how often we see these types of accidents.

70
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, there are a lot of idiots.

71
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,970
Okay, what do we need to do here, Murphy?

72
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,660
A superficial partial-thickness burn

73
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,320
should be managed conservatively.

74
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,470
Cleanse the area, debride with soft gauze,

75
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,020
and then cover with an antimicrobial petroleum dressing.

76
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,140
All of which means,

77
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,300
this should heal with minimal scarring.

78
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,630
Naja, are you having chest pain?

79
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,510
I think I'm having a heart attack.

80
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,760
It's hard to breathe.

81
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,490
Just relax if you can.

82
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,460
Put her on oxygen, a 12 lead EKG,

83
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,760
and order a portable chest X-ray.

84
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,790
Murphy, let's move. Come on.

85
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,170
Her vitals are stable.

86
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,930
What the hell is going on here?

87
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,230
I don't know.

88
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,680
But it is interesting.

89
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,280
We've got a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Suction.

90
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,100
I need to isolate the aneurysm.

91
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,780
Poor kid.

92
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,150
Imagine finding your dad like that.

93
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,390
Well, that's exactly how I want to die.

94
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,560
If the dad doesn't make it,

95
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,410
the kid will always remember that moment --

96
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,590
be traumatized by it.

97
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,720
Because he loves him.

98
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,440
The idea of dying without anybody getting hurt --

99
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,250
There's nothing sadder than an empty waiting room.

100
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,620
Okay, what do you see?

101
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,760
A bulge on the anterior communicating artery.

102
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,710
Yeah, the ruptured aneurysm is compromising

103
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,200
blood flow to the frontal lobe.

104
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,360
Prep an 11 millimeter standard clip.

105
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,810
Are you married?

106
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,910
Not anymore.

107
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,560
Turns out he had even worse judgment than I did.

108
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,630
Oh, speaking of creeps, you hear Coyle got transferred?

109
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm so glad they shut him down.

110
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,260
Well, yeah, I guess.

111
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,690
Just wish they'd spent the money on a Pediatric Trauma Pod.

112
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,580
They gave him a raise.

113
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,160
Clip.

114
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,560
The EKG confirmed

115
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,350
you weren't having a heart attack.

116
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,820
I-I wasn't faking.

117
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,070
I wouldn't do that.

118
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,970
We know.

119
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,550
The imaging also confirmed

120
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,370
that you have considerable lung inflammation.

121
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,880
Is it possible you inhaled smoke?

122
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,500
I guess I must have.

123
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,630
There was a minor grease fire.

124
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,610
What happens now?

125
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,160
You need a bronchoscopy.

126
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,530
We put a camera down your throat to see how much damage there is

127
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,060
and what we need to do to repair it.

128
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,280
But don't worry. You'll be sedated.

129
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,180
Please don't.

130
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,750
Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry.

131
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,540
The test is absolutely necessary.

132
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,800
The test is fine.

133
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,820
But, um...

134
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,790
please don't touch me, except for medical purposes.

135
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,790
Yeah, of course.

136
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,530
That does not make sense.

137
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,360
A number of religions have rules about touching.

138
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,310
I don't quite get it, but --

139
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,690
That makes sense.

140
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,240
People shouldn't touch people

141
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,150
unless there's a very good reason.

142
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay, then...

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,260
what doesn't make sense?

144
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,940
The grease fire.

145
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,300
The grease fire explains the whole thing --

146
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,640
the burn, the smoke.

147
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,270
She told us she forgot the stove was hot.

148
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,930
How can you forget something's hot

149
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,390
when it is on fire?

150
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,040
Shaun, I'm sure we would have heard more of the story

151
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,150
if she hadn't suddenly thought she was having a heart attack.

152
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,910
Why didn't you fire him?

153
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,650
Because his story was different than yours.

154
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,970
And you believe his story?

155
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,840
I believe your story.

156
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,890
But you can't prove it.

157
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,460
And we simply can't make a policy

158
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,140
of believing every woman who files a complaint against every man.

159
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,970
After a few thousand years of doing the opposite,

160
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,780
it wouldn't kill us to overcorrect.

161
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,460
And the fact that - your boyfriend assaulted him

162
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,490
took away any leverage I had.

163
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,040
I did what I could.

164
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,020
I got him to take a position

165
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,860
where he has very little contact with staff, with patients --

166
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,010
outreach chair.

167
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,660
And it's a lousy assignment.

168
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,340
Sooner or later, he's gonna quit.

169
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,610
And get a job somewhere else.

170
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,000
If you have any better ideas...

171
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,900
I look forward to hearing them.

172
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,640
You're very lucky.

173
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,470
The aneurysm was in a small communicating artery.

174
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,860
We were able to restore blood flow

175
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,450
to the impacted brain areas.

176
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,460
He's gonna be okay.

177
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,450
Thank God.

178
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,580
Is this what life is gonna be like from now on?

179
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,500
A-are these things just going to keep happening?

180
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,460
We're gonna keep him here for a few days,

181
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,850
do some follow-up testing,

182
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,370
make some adjustments to his medications.

183
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,130
Hopefully, we'll find out why this happened.

184
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,800
I have to go.

185
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,790
Another one?

186
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,490
Post-operative imaging showed a 26-millimeter aneurysm

187
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,990
in the basilar artery.

188
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,070
That size and location,

189
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,690
we're looking at a high risk of rupture.

190
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,520
He must have a genetic predisposition --

191
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,480
maybe a connective tissue disease?

192
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,210
All academic till we repair it.

193
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,230
Through the pharynx

194
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,390
and over - to Grandmother's house we go.

195
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,270
There's the epiglottis and the vocal cords.

196
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,450
I know you're not happy that I sued the hospital.

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,590
But I'm not gonna apologize for that.

198
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,150
That makes it simple.

199
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,540
I did it because I want to be here.

200
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,120
I believe I can learn a lot from you,

201
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,530
even from your doghouse.

202
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,180
I just hope you give me a chance, sir.

203
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,110
There's the carina.

204
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,600
Gonna pass into the mainstem bronchus of the left lung.

205
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,980
Is breaking up with your fiancée traumatic?

206
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,480
When I saw a woman get shot,

207
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,210
everyone told me it was traumatic

208
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,000
and that I should be going home.

209
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,660
Should you be going home?

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,950
Give me a mucosal brush for a cellular sample.

211
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,770
Loading it now.

212
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,730
How long does it take to get over a breakup

213
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,060
with the woman you love?

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,730
I'm seeing a lot of inflammation,

215
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,190
but no smoke damage.

216
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,100
That makes se-sense.

217
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,010
I thought we were doing this because she inhaled smoke.

218
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:44,120
She said she inhaled smoke.

219
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,840
I didn't believe her.

220
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,480
Whatever the cause, the inflammation and the damage are real.

221
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,140
Let's get a mucosal biopsy.

222
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,390
I move down here, we --

223
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,880
The scope breached her bronchial wall.

224
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,890
She's hemorrhaging.

225
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,180
- This is bad. - Prep the O.R.!

226
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,820
Type and cross two units of blood. We've gotta move!

227
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,720
We know there was a burn.

228
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,060
Was it something related to the grease fire,

229
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,990
or separate coincidental injury?

230
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,930
You don't have a theory,

231
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,240
or are you refusing to talk to Jared?

232
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,620
I didn't answer because it doesn't matter

233
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,980
until we can repair this puncture

234
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,750
before bacteria passes through and spreads an infection.

235
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,790
That's true.

236
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,040
Cut this suture.

237
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,330
Let's approximate the edges with forceps.

238
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,480
Are you and Jared even now?

239
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,580
He made a mistake. So did you.

240
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,180
Exactly what mistake did I make?

241
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,620
This breach was your fault.

242
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,860
Is that traumatic?

243
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,690
I had breakfast by myself.

244
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,040
Where were you?

245
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,500
I'm sorry. Were we supposed to have breakfast this morning?

246
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,770
I had an early consult.

247
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:58,830
Yes, we always have breakfast on Mondays.

248
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,880
We do? Every Monday.

249
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,450
Every Monday.

250
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,180
Thank you.

251
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,810
Well, I guess our streak has been broken then, huh?

252
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,750
If someone punctures the bronchus

253
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,100
during a routine bronchoscopy, that's a mistake, right?

254
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,770
Well, I can't imagine how it wouldn't be.

255
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,360
Why? What did you do, Shaun?

256
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,240
I'm wondering if I need to report Dr. Melendez.

257
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,960
Dr. Melendez did that?

258
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,090
The protocol is very clear.

259
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,850
I need to report it.

260
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,440
But I've seen how Jared is being treated.

261
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
Will Dr. Melendez treat me badly

262
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,140
if I report this?

263
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,990
He shouldn't, obviously.

264
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,850
But human nature being what...

265
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,960
Human nature?

266
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,510
Shaun, you know what?

267
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,730
You should make this decision for yourself.

268
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
In fact -- In fact...

269
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,240
you should to make - all your decisions yourself from here on in.

270
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,280
That's what we agreed on, right?

271
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,650
Have you considered an endovascular embolization procedure?

272
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,500
I have.

273
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,630
It's a little less risky,

274
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,780
but I haven't done as many,

275
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,130
so I'm not sure which way we're better off.

276
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,260
You want me to check the roster --

277
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,410
see if there's somebody available with more experience?

278
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,520
I would like to assist, but yes.

279
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,670
Okay, here we go.

280
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,300
No, he's not available.

281
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,930
So make him available.

282
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,190
I got a husband and father

283
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,780
who presented with two aneurysms in the last 12 hours.

284
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,250
I'd rather not.

285
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,610
This particular surgeon was recently...

286
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,930
transferred.

287
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,070
Not a chance.

288
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,460
Coyle is the best available surgeon for the job.

289
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,520
Coyle should've been fired, and if he'd been fired,

290
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,630
he wouldn't be available.

291
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,720
And if he wasn't available,

292
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
you would be the best person for the job.

293
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,430
Our ultimate duty is to the patient.

294
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,170
No, it's not.

295
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,420
You agree he should have been fired.

296
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,170
Of course.

297
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,080
Even if he was the - best doctor in this hospital,

298
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,580
he should have been fired, right?

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,150
Yes.

300
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,930
So some things have to matter more

301
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,730
than who is the most skilled.

302
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,090
If we forgive Coyle just because he's good at something,

303
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,950
what does he do next?

304
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,990
Either he matters or we matter.

305
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,560
Were you upset during the procedure?

306
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,310
Did Murphy tell you that I was "Traumatized"?

307
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,610
You think that I might have almost killed a person

308
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,890
because you dumped me?

309
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:46,090
The fact that you're describing it as "Me dumping you"

310
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,000
suggests that you are upset.

311
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,530
Look, I'm fine. You're fine.

312
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,880
Nobody's upset.

313
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,730
Great.

314
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,060
But you do understand

315
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,110
that I have to ask you these questions,

316
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,900
that I need a statement from you.

317
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,610
Yes.

318
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,850
Here's my statement --

319
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,850
"I wasn't distracted.

320
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,110
I didn't screw up."

321
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,380
You get all that?

322
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,780
Your bronchus was punctured during the procedure,

323
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,900
but it's been repaired.

324
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,370
How? How could that happen?

325
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,970
Why did you lie?

326
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,950
You said that you inhaled smoke,

327
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,930
but there was no evidence of smoke.

328
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,600
So, what do you gain by lying to your doctors?

329
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,680
I wasn't lying.

330
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,790
I was just...

331
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
confused, I guess.

332
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,340
I was in a lot of pain,

333
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,530
and it was all happening so fast.

334
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,980
My stomach!

335
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,970
Naja, what are you feeling?

336
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,100
It's really sore and... I feel like I'm going to--

337
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,170
Can we get some help over here?!

338
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,480
Four milligrams of ondansetron.

339
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,400
Airway inflammation, abdominal pain, nausea.

340
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,030
We need a full blood panel and abdominal ultrasound.

341
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,080
The procedure will seal off the aneurysm,

342
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,940
but there will almost certainly be some brain damage --

343
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,490
anything from mild visual or speech disturbances

344
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,560
to significant paralysis.

345
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,520
But without the surgery, he'll die.

346
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,400
No. I-I won't consent to the operation.

347
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,120
There really isn't a lot of choice here.

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,170
Without the operation --

349
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,510
After his first stroke, it --

350
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,590
it took him so long to recover.

351
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,500
It was frustrating and painful for him.

352
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,560
But he did recover.

353
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,570
He made it clear he'd never want to live compromised.

354
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,520
Excuse me.

355
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,350
Thank you for having breakfast with me.

356
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,850
My pleasure.

357
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,720
People lie a lot, don't they?

358
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,650
No, I-I meant it, Shaun.

359
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,460
I'm happy to spend time with you.

360
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,960
There are seven reasons that I've thought of.

361
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,460
There may even be more.

362
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,160
Do people ever lie without a reason?

363
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,130
No.

364
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,570
Reason number six. I think you just lied.

365
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,280
I think you just lied to avoid something.

366
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,140
You don't like this conversation.

367
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,300
Shaun, n-- Shaun, I'm sorry.

368
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:49,520
I'm just -- just a little distracted.

369
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,760
My aneurysm patient --

370
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,890
We're treating him with blood-pressure meds

371
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,400
to try and avoid a rupture.

372
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,680
You should do - an endovascular embolization.

373
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,920
He doesn't want one.

374
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,340
It could leave him with brain damage.

375
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,490
I thought he was unconscious.

376
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,560
He is.

377
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,560
His wife knows what he wants.

378
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,230
It's amazing. I just --

379
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,860
I don't think I'd be able to do that.

380
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,720
She's sacrificing her happiness, her future,

381
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,750
just because she knows --

382
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,880
She's lying.

383
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,230
She's lying.

384
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,010
It could be either reason number four or --

385
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,670
No, she's not lying, Shaun. She loves him.

386
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,690
She doesn't love him.

387
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,250
You haven't even met her!

388
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,530
You haven't seen what she's like with him, with their son.

389
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,070
I'm not good at reading people.

390
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,650
- Well, I am, and - I think people-reading

391
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,180
embraces personal biases.

392
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,080
I think we should try to avoid biases.

393
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,690
Knowledge of human behavior

394
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,180
can help us make - informed, intuitive decisions.

395
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,820
My way is better.

396
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,490
It's based on actions. She's lying.

397
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,440
All right.

398
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,720
If you love someone,

399
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,580
you'll do anything to prevent their death.

400
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,390
This...situation --

401
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,540
There seems to be a conflict of interest.

402
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,970
So I would like to bring in someone else from legal

403
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,010
to handle it.

404
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,920
Yeah, I agree.

405
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,990
You're an excellent lawyer, but --

406
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,130
But what?

407
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,330
Do you think this is my problem?

408
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,740
It's understandable.

409
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,360
48 hours ago, we were engaged.

410
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,750
And now, suddenly,

411
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,060
you're supposed to be investigating me?

412
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,890
Yes.

413
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,970
And doing crazy things,

414
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,120
like expecting you to give me complete answers

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,500
to appropriate questions.

416
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,990
You were trusting Murphy's judgment over mine.

417
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,450
His judgment about my demeanor.

418
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,660
Seriously?

419
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,750
I asked you a question.

420
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,390
You wanted me to screw up.

421
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,860
You did screw up.

422
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,850
So what?

423
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,090
So we just deal with it.

424
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,850
But if you can't even admit that you're not always perfect,

425
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,410
then I -- - I am not perfect!

426
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,210
Clearly, I have made mistakes in my life.

427
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,690
But not this time.

428
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,420
That punctured bronchus was not my fault.

429
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,040
The nurse says his vital signs are stable.

430
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,840
No change.

431
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:29,770
That's good.

432
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,040
It's...

433
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,480
such a great sacrifice

434
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,610
to respect his wishes enough to let him go.

435
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,840
You must love your husband very much.

436
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,060
But...

437
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,510
there could be another explanation.

438
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,940
Either you love him enough to let him die...

439
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,720
or you hate him enough to let him die.

440
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,150
You don't know - what you're talking about.

441
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,890
There's a doctor here who harassed me.

442
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,060
He made me feel vulnerable, worthless --

443
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,170
neither of which I am.

444
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,040
But he never hurt me.

445
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,740
I can't imagine how I would feel if he did,

446
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,030
what I would do,

447
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,360
what I would want to do to him.

448
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,640
What did your husband do to you?

449
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,330
He's a good father.

450
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,150
No, he's not.

451
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,520
A good father doesn't hurt a mother.

452
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,950
Payton loves him.

453
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,990
All the more reason --

454
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,710
No.

455
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,480
Payton doesn't know anything. He never can.

456
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,380
I know you're afraid he'll come after you,

457
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,050
but there are people who can help.

459
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,060
Payton is better off with the memory of a loving father

460
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,230
than the truth.

461
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,730
Let him die.

462
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,780
Methanol is causing her abdominal pain.

463
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,240
She drank wood alcohol?

464
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,740
People drink whatever they can drink.

465
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,650
Well, she's Muslim -- Wouldn't let me touch her.

466
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,770
Religious people aren't immune to hypocrisy.

467
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,160
There are other ways to explain the presence of methanol.

468
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,010
It's also produced by the liver

469
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,650
when the body is exposed to certain caustic chemicals.

470
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,960
If inhaled, caustic chemicals could also inflame the lungs.

471
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,730
And caustic chemicals also burn,

472
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,640
so it would explain all her symptoms.

473
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,550
Do you happen to have a list

474
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,100
of which caustic chemicals do all that?

475
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,430
Dimethyl sulfate

476
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:19,100
It's used in - the pharmaceutical industry.

477
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:19,780
She's a school teacher.

478
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,150
It's also used in water treatment, industrial pesticides,

479
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,520
and chemical weapons.

480
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,000
She has no reason to be involved

481
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,160
with water treatment or industrial pesticides.

482
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,750
But she could be a school teacher and a terrorist.

483
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,780
- So, what do we do? - The surgery.

484
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,920
We don't have her consent.

485
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,470
Technically, the issue is we don't have his consent.

486
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,760
We go to his wife because we can't get his,

487
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,730
the assumption being that she's operating in his best interests.

488
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,530
Pretty sure that's not happening here.

489
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,440
Go back to the wife, get her to change her mind,

490
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,820
or we'll take it to court.

491
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,080
Okay.

492
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,570
Hey, you look annoyed.

493
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,970
I'm annoyed we're sending him home to keep abusing his wife.

494
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,120
She's a world-class liar.

495
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,910
I mean, for all we know, she wants her husband dead

496
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,230
so that she can run off with her Pilates instructor.

497
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,180
- I'll get the consent. - Thank you.

498
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,100
She refused initial treatment for methanol toxicity.

499
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,280
It's ethanol --

500
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,920
Because she's Muslim, she can't consume it.

501
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,660
She has alcohol in her system

502
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,720
but won't let us put alcohol in her system to treat it,

503
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,690
because she doesn't want alcohol in her system.

504
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,930
- We put her on fomepi - Dr. Murphy...

505
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,260
Is this part of your evidence that she's a terrorist?

506
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,680
Because she's Muslim?

507
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,880
There are billions of Muslims that aren't terrorists.

508
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,680
Is that part of your evidence that she's not?

509
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,190
I think she's a terrorist because it's the easiest way

510
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,500
to explain her symptoms and her lie.

511
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,900
Do you have a way?

512
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,480
She had an accident. It scared her.

513
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,930
Maybe we scare her. Hell, maybe this whole place scares her.

514
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,820
There are a lot of reasons people don't tell the truth

515
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,090
other than criminal activity.

516
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,700
Six other reasons.

517
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,540
If a person comes in with a gunshot wound,

518
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,020
we have to report it.

519
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,340
Why don't we have to report

520
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,180
someone who might be making chemical weapons?

521
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,840
Because unfounded accusations can destroy people's lives.

522
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,390
What does it matter what people speculate

523
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,950
as long as the truth comes out?

524
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,330
Because people make up their minds

525
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,890
before the truth comes out.

526
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,420
Says the guy who played the race card

527
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,080
when he needed an advantage.

528
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,590
Even if you're right,

529
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,420
she's not making bombs while she's in our ICU.

530
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,020
Also, you're wrong. Now, keep me posted.

531
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,900
If she's not better in the next two hours,

532
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,130
I want to know.

533
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,040
We need you to consent to your husband's surgery.

534
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,820
I said "No."

535
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,820
There's a better way, Tessa.

536
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,340
Leave him.

537
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,420
Start a new life.

538
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,080
I'm afraid.

539
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,060
I know.

540
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,610
But...this --

541
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,080
This isn't the answer.

542
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,390
If you don't consent,

543
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,810
we'll take this to the court,

544
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,500
and we'll tell a judge what we know.

545
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,270
I told you those things in confidence.

546
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,550
You are not my patient. Your husband is.

547
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,230
Two things will happen.

548
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,200
We will get the consent,

549
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,230
and Payton will find out the truth.

550
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,040
Tessa?

551
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,520
You are stronger than you think you are.

552
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,770
Your methanol toxicity is abating --

553
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,360
The treatment's working.

554
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,960
Great.

555
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,180
Do you think that I'll be able to leave soon?

556
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,650
All of your symptoms are consistent

557
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,040
with exposure to dimethyl sulfate.

558
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,820
I -- I've never heard of dimethyl --

559
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,800
Dimethyl sulfate is used to make chemical weapons.

560
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,720
I didn't expect this from you.

561
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,670
I made a statement.

562
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,740
You're different.

563
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,550
I have autism.

564
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:16,190
You've experienced bigotry.

565
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,080
Yes.

566
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,840
Have...people refused to serve you?

567
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,440
Have you seen people

568
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,180
change their flight

569
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:30,920
because of you?

570
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,220
Have people cursed you out

571
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,270
before you've opened your mouth?

572
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,460
I'm not prejudiced.

573
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,120
I have evidence.

574
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,750
Nobody's prejudiced.

575
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,400
Everybody has evidence.

576
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,720
And I'm always brown.

577
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,990
Maybe you're not so different.

578
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,090
You're sweating.

579
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,040
Perspiration is a sign of dishonesty.

580
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,250
My chest.

581
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:13,450
Chest pain can be brought on by anxiety.

582
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,400
Oh, but this time, you are having a heart attack.

583
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,870
EKG, stat!

584
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,610
The endothelial lining had moderate inflammation that appeared acute,

585
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,800
and there was evidence of mucosal edema.

586
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,980
I made no extraordinary motions,

587
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,250
nor did I apply any unnecessary force.

588
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,500
And yet, the bronchus was punctured.

589
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,420
Which is a risk, albeit a small one,

590
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,850
with this kind of procedure.

591
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,220
Well...

592
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,390
thank you.

593
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,950
I appreciate the thoroughness of your answers.

594
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,390
Not sure I understood it all...

595
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,710
...but I think I've got what I need.

596
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,320
I probably shouldn't say anything,

597
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,170
but I know you and Ms. Preston

598
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,450
are going through something right now.

599
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,540
That really wasn't relevant.

600
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,090
I-I know. I know. It's just...

601
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,610
I know she'll get through it, but...

602
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,600
it's good you're handling it better.

603
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,120
It's one thing to be distracted while drafting a contract

604
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,600
and a whole other thing entirely doing what you do.

605
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,060
Inject dye.

606
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,070
Injecting dye.

607
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,410
Hanging a left at the vertebral artery.

608
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,690
Okay, withdrawing the guide wire.

609
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,410
Inserting the platinum matrix.

610
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,860
You know, sometimes, you do the right thing

611
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,160
and things get a little better.

612
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,330
And sometimes, things still suck.

613
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,220
Entering the aneurysm.

614
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,870
Okay.

615
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,670
Blood pressure's spiking.

616
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,370
Wait, why?

617
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,140
There's no rupture, no bleeding,

618
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,300
no stroke.

619
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,810
If his BP goes up any higher, he will have a stroke.

620
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,560
I'm terminating the procedure.

621
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,100
Push 20 milligrams of labetalol, stat.

622
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,320
We need to stabilize him before we can retry the procedure,

623
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,880
which means we need to figure out what we missed.

624
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,460
This wasn't our fault.

625
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,540
His BP was stable going in.

626
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,770
He's been on calcium-channel blockers for the last six years.

627
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,070
Well, we missed something.

628
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,200
BP doesn't skyrocket for no reason.

629
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,210
Run a full work-up.

630
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,200
Why would a 28-year-old with no risk factors

631
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,520
have a heart attack?

632
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,760
Her heart is burning.

633
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,010
Burning?

634
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,980
From the caustic chemical!

635
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,450
- Murphy. - It's going through her system.

636
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,470
Unlike thermal burns,

637
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,660
chemical burns get worse over time.

638
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,710
And it also explains the punctured bronchus.

639
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,950
The caustic chemical thinned the bronchial walls.

640
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,880
You did not make a mistake.

641
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,680
That's not the only explanation.

642
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,380
But I'll shut up now.

643
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,650
You think you have a good idea,

644
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,460
but you're going to shut yourself up?

645
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,730
It could be caused by an infection

646
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,260
from bacteria that leaked

647
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,220
as a result of the puncture.

648
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,050
The treatments are diametrically opposed --

649
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,490
antibiotics if it's infection,

650
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,660
steroids if it's inflammation.

651
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:38,690
If she needs antibiotics and she needs steroids instead,

652
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,060
it will suppress her immune system,

653
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,300
causing the infection to flourish and kill her.

654
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,880
If she needs steroids

655
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,620
and we give her antibiotics, then --

656
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,590
I get it.

657
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,260
We'd better be right.

658
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,290
Yes.

659
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,140
Sir, I think we should bring another senior attending in

660
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,270
- to consult on this decision. - Why?

661
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,490
Because if Shaun's right, you're exonerated.

662
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,070
And if I'm right, you may have made the mistake

663
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,240
that could kill this woman.

664
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,460
You don't think I can be objective?

665
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,460
I think you're incredibly professional --

666
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,710
Shut up, Jared.

667
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,040
It is possible that I screwed up.

668
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,760
Let's put her on broad-spectrum antibiotics.

669
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,400
You're wrong.

670
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,620
Making a decision on the assumption you made a mistake is a mistake.

671
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,830
You're very arrogant.

672
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,770
It helps you be a great surgeon.

673
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,940
Fortunately, I don't need your approval.

674
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,350
We've determined what the underlying problem was.

675
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,160
What caused your husband's aneurysm to rupture

676
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,630
and why his blood pressure spiked in the O.R.

677
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,620
According to his labs, he hasn't been taking his meds.

678
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,440
As far as I know, he has.

679
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,020
I mean, that's just not like him.

680
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:02,030
We don't think it's like him, either.

681
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,600
You think I had something to do with this?

682
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,050
That I, what, threw his meds away?

683
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,210
He'd just order more.

684
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,810
But if you emptied his capsules and filled them with sugar --

685
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,730
or, even better, salt --

686
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,190
It would end your nightmare.

687
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,520
I was willing to let him die,

688
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,620
but I could never --

689
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,870
If I were strong enough to kill him...

690
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,160
Is there a chance your son knows more than you think he does?

691
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,030
Her heart rate's 90.

692
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,140
That's in the normal range.

693
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,650
But it was 83. It should be going down.

694
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:22,280
All her other signs are normal.

695
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,380
You were right. This is the proper treatment.

696
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,650
95.

697
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,650
I'm switching her to steroids.

698
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,910
If we give her steroids,

699
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,250
it will suppress her immune system,

700
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,500
causing the infection to flourish...

701
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,450
I'm going to push 40 milligrams of methylprednisolone.

702
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,970
...and she'll die.

703
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,540
This is on me.

704
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,450
I know.

705
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,170
We switched her to methylprednisolone.

706
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,510
It's working.

707
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,200
You were wrong.

708
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,680
Yeah, I got that.

709
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,680
Just about the treatment choice.

710
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,790
You didn't do anything wrong in the O.R.

711
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,040
Don't kiss my ass.

712
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,460
Jared saved her life.

713
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,420
If he hadn't acted so quickly, she would've died,

714
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,990
and that would've been your fault.

715
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,240
Yes, it would've.

716
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,700
You should thank him.

717
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,230
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

718
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,840
Can I help you?

719
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,750
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

720
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,120
You're my new neighbor, number 34.

721
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,770
Yeah, cool.

722
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,470
You wanna come in for a beer?

723
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,380
No.

724
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,420
Nice work.

725
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,440
You, too.

726
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,590
You can have the honors.

727
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,870
This is the first time I'm not looking forward

728
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,110
to telling the family it went well.

729
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,440
You're going to be fine.

730
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,540
The treatment worked?

731
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,290
The second one did. The first one almost killed you.

732
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,450
The fact that you're alive right now is evidence

733
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,300
that you were working with dimethyl sulfate.

734
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,850
You're a terrorist, aren't you?

735
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,910
My brother works for a drug company.

736
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,770
They use dimethyl sulfate to make one of their medications.

737
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:46,870
He stole some for me.

738
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,320
So you could make a chemical weapon.

739
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,500
So I could make perfume.

740
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,090
Smell that.

741
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,770
It's...beautiful.

742
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,130
But very stupid.

743
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,090
Yeah.

744
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,430
Especially since my brother would get fired

745
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,830
if anyone ever found out.

746
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,860
You believe her?

747
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,770
Protecting someone --

748
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,740
reason number three.

749
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,230
So...we good?

750
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,120
Thing is, I'm not sure it really matters.

751
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,290
I've been told I can only have three residents next year.

752
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,640
That's great.

753
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,640
Not really.

754
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,130
Because of Coyle's transfer, I have to take on his.

755
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,280
Reznick?

756
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,720
She's a pain.

757
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,290
Pain can be a hell of motivator.

758
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,860
Good luck.

759
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,360
You were right.

760
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,620
And I think you were right that I wanted you to be wrong.

761
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:06,430
And I'm sorry.

762
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,340
You were right, too.

763
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,020
I kept telling myself that I'm fine, but...

764
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,270
it's been hard.

765
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,920
Got me second-guessing myself,

766
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:20,720
maybe affecting my judgment.

767
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,050
I don't know.

768
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,520
If we're hurting so bad, maybe we made a mistake.

769
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,480
No.

770
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,870
It just means that what we had mattered.

771
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,740
Doesn't mean that it was right.

772
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,320
I've also been thinking that...

773
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,500
arrogance does make me a better surgeon.

774
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,690
But it's not gonna make me a better husband.

775
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,970
I'm sorry.

776
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,800
Kristin?

777
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,140
I'm Claire.

778
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,910
Thanks.

779
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,450
I am doing some research on Dr. Coyle --

780
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,350
on the women who worked with him and then quit.

781
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,630
I got another offer at SF Muni.

782
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,390
I was harassed by Dr. Coyle.

783
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,460
And I think you were, too.

784
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:51,210
Doing the right thing can make things a little better...

785
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:55,800
especially if we do it together.

786
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,770
I have a new neighbor.

787
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,520
So, Lea's really gone, huh?

788
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,150
So, can we have breakfast tomorrow?

789
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,250
I'd love to, Shaun, but...

790
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,110
we...

791
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,830
We talked about this, right?

792
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,320
I-I said that I would back off if you stayed, right?

793
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
More space, less "Fathering."

794
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,850
I don't need a father.

795
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,560
I hate fathers.

796
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,420
Right, so --

797
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,360
I need a friend.

798
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,540
Shaun, I-I am someone who can't help but give advice, you know?

799
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,080
I don't know if I can not do that.

800
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:11,790
So you think I can change and you can't?

801
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,760
I think that we have a certain kind of relationship.

802
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,420
And we can call it something different if we want,

803
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,400
but we can't magically make it different.

804
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,320
You said that you wanted space.

805
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,100
You said that you needed space.

806
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:36,430
I-I think you should be my friend.

807
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,410
Shaun...

808
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,190
Okay.

809
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,130
Shaun?
