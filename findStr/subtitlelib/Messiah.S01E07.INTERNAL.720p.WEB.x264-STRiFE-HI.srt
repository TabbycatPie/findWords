Anna. You saw what we all saw.

Yes, I saw it.

34
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,051
[Felix] We witnessed a miracle.

35
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,720
It did look like a miracle.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,517
It's just a lot to take in.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,645
I know it's a lot,
but the world just changed, Anna,

38

and we're all a part of it now.

39
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,156
What are we supposed to do with all this?

00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,450

Go inside, that way.

00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,820
Brother Zaid is a good man. A teacher.

We studied together.

Sheikh Zaid!

Please come in.

Stay here.

I'm not to leave?

64
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,974
It's for your protection.
There are threats against you.

65
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,602
Not just the Israelis,
but Muslim brothers, too,

66
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,313
who don't like your "al-Masih."

67
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,191
It's from all sides. I'm sorry.

68
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,152
But you'll be safer here.

69
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,570
What about the others?

70
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,156
They are not you.

[Q, in English] <i>No one thought
he was any kind of leader in the camp.</i>

73
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,710
So it was just a moment of desperation
on the boy's part.

74
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,296
Looks that way.
But he's sparked off another wave.

75
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,381
Rioting's spread to the West Bank now.

76
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,799
When will you be back?

77
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,719
Uh, I can't say. I'm onto something here.

78
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,846
Eva, we need you back in Israel.

79
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,349
I'm in Iran for at least another day.

80
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,309
Then you'll need to get back soon.

81
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,518
Keep me posted.

00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,396
[stubbing out cigarette]

83
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,319
[Eva] Payam Golshiri plays
at being this nomadic holy man,

84
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,820
but he's not acting alone.

85
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,989
He has resources.

86
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,243
Intel. The private plane that he took
from Jordan to Mexico was leased

87
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,372
by a shell company
that we traced back to Russia.

88
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,248
And the Russian link gets deeper.

89
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:17,085
Golshiri spent a semester
at Williams College

90
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,712
when Oscar Wallace
was still a professor there.

91
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,882
Now, as you know, Wallace has been
in hiding outside of Moscow

92
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,552
under the Kremlin's protection
ever since he hacked the stock exchange.

93
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,472
Now, his online posts
continue to incite his followers

94
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,892
to carry out acts of social disruption.

95
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,771
What if Wallace cultivated a relationship
with Golshiri at Williams

96
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:37,939
and recruited him?

97
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,982
Converted him to his ideas.

98
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:44,278
What better agent of chaos
than a new messiah?

99
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,323
You're basing this all on the fact

100
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,992
that they happened to be
at the same place at the same time?

101
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,495
Not just that, their ideologies align.

102
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,748
Ideologies? Is there anything actionable?

103
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,796
We have eyes on Golshiri 24/7,
his brother is in Iran.

104
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,924
We're interviewing him.
Maybe he will tell us something.

105
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,553
[sighs] Have you been watching the news?

106
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,891
The West Bank is in full Arab Spring mode
and DC feels like Woodstock.

107
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:18,020
So he has a brother, so he spent a...
a semester abroad. So what?

108
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,357
We need to discredit
this asshole right now,

109
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,444
and I'm not hearing anything
that sounds like real ammunition.

110
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,528
- Sir...
- No.

111
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,614
Give me a photograph
of Golshiri looking like a terrorist,

112
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,076
- building a bomb, cutting off a head.
- You're not gonna find that.

113
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,663
Cameron. We're talking
about something else here.

114
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,331
He didn't blow up a building.

115
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,208
He walked on water.

116
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,836
Every time we crack down
on one form of terrorism

117
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,796
another threat pops up in its place.

118
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,299
al-Qaeda, ISIL, it evolves.

119
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,677
What we're facing now is
a state-sponsored social disruption.

120
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,388
This is a new world.
This isn't just about one man.

121
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,223
This is a war of ideas.

122
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,978
You can call it whatever kind of war
you like, but it looks like we're losing.

123
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,025
The president doesn't care about
your half-baked deep-state conspiracies.

124
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,069
Get us a smoking gun.

Something troubles you.

128
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,009
It's nothing.

129
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,514

131
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,479
Perhaps we have both changed.

132
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,985
These boys will study and learn,
like we did.

133
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,489
They will find purpose here, God willing.

134
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,615
Mm-hm.

00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,527
All right. [sighs] So...

142
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,907
Would you all like to discuss, um...

143
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,119
how you are feeling
about everything that's going on?

144
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,207
- Go ahead.
- All the histrionics, it's BS, right?

145
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,752
Nobody really believes this guy.

146
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:32,840
It's just people want an excuse
to skip class or get high or whatever.

147
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,923
Mm-hm.

148
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,803
I don't know. I...
I think people are being sincere.

149
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,683
I mean, I'm afraid that he's real.

150
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,063
Why are you afraid, Casey?

151
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,692
Think about it. If he's real, like,
what are we supposed to do?

152
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,779
Just give up everything
and then start worshiping him?

153
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,911
What would it mean
for this man to be real?

154
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,414
Well, in Islam, the arrival of the messiah

155
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,584
means a civilization-ending war.

156
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,878
So, if this guy is legit...

157
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,256
we're in for a major bloodbath.

158
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,134
[girl] Well, what if he turns out
to be Christian?

159
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,346
Then this course is irrelevant.

160
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,938
Yeah, no, I wanna check...

Everyone else, stand back.

175
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,478
I'm looking at...

176
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,854
Fox News...

177
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,610
al-Masih! al-Masih!

178
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,077
- [man] We believe in you!
- [woman] Thank you!

179
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,329
[man] He is here!

180
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,959
[man 2] Make way, please.

181
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,467
Excuse us.

182
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,992
I have. Yes, I...

183
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,911
[indistinct chattering]

184
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,919

[clears throat]

187
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,137
Welcome, everyone.

188
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,266
Thank you for coming
to our prayer meeting.

189
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:14,103
As some of you may know,
I'm Reverend Felix Iguero.

190
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,355
- [woman] Where's al-Masih?
- [woman 2] Is he here?

191
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,358
He's gonna address you all again,
in his own time.

192
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,152
Right now, though, we're here to pray.

193
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,381
- [woman 3] Do you speak for him?
- [man] What exactly...

194
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,406
No.

195
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,532
No, I don't.

196
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,577
I, uh... I want to make that clear.

197
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,122
I'm just a preacher
of a small church in Texas.

198
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,625
And though we didn't have
much of anything,

199
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,836
what we did have a lot of...

200
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,755
was faith.

201
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,217
And maybe that's why we were rewarded.

202
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,513
Maybe that's why our town
was touched by God.

203
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:55,769
Now, we all witnessed a miracle.

204
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,939
We are the generation God has chosen.

205
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,319
And we need to think about why.

206
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,157
Why he chose us.

207
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,160
We need to heed his call.

208
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,786
Mm.

209
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,375
Let us pray.

210
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:19,668
[bell pings]

211
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,093
[man on radio] <i>Uh, Dave,
this is Steve here.</i>

212
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,888
<i>Can we get someone down here
on the eighth loading dock?</i>

213
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,307
Can I help you?

214
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,516
We need to see him.

215
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,811
- How did you get into the hotel?
- My daughter is sick.

216
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,024
- Look, miss...
- We drove from Colorado to Texas to here.

217
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,234
We waited like they said to.

218
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,904
But we can't wait anymore.
We're running out of time.

219
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,280
Can you understand that?

220
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,157
Look at her.

221
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,202
I'm not going home
without my daughter seeing him.

222
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,296
I will see your daughter but only her.

223
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,343
Go ahead, sweetie.

224
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,512
Go ahead.

225
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,913
[Eva] Were these cameras here
since the beginning?

226
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,875
Who do you think comped their whole floor?

227
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,378
[Eva] Nothing?

228
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,755
[Will sighs]

229
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,799
This is his first contact.

230
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,095
[Eva] Is he talking to her?

231
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,393
I'm... I'm not gettin' anything.

232
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,317
Who's that girl?

233
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,823
[Will] Her mother's lookin' for a miracle.

234
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,663
Why is he bothering with this charade?

235
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,183
- Thank you so much. Bye.
- Thank you so much, Reverend. Take care.

236
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,259
- Congratulations, Felix!
- Ed. I thought you might be in town.

237
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,011
I've been watching you on the talk shows.

238
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,306
Well, everyone's just looking
for any insight they can find.

239
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,143
You were very collected up there.
I'm impressed.

240
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,645
Not everyone could handle
that kind of spotlight.

241
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,147
Thank you. That means a lot.

242
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,399
But if you really want
to harness all this,

243
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,026
it's gonna be a big operation.

244
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,486
How do you mean, "harness"?

245
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,612
[Ed] Well...

246
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,363
You know, I have a venue.

247
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,407
Broadcast contract.

248
00:17:55,491 --> 00:18:00,120
I can help you. Help you amplify
the message, if you'd like.

249
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,291
Where do you see all this going?

250
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,187
- I'm gonna leave that up to God.
- [bell pings]

251
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,796
Oh, this is me.

252
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:11,507
[Ed] All right.

253
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,550
Okay, then.

254
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,135
We'll talk.

258
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,739
[in Arabic] You are brave, my sons.

259
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,535
It was not easy
to resist that cursed man...

260
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,788
that deceiver.

261
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,959
He could be the false messiah.

262
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,587
God protect us!

263
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,006
His followers are doomed...

264
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,383
in this life and the next.

265
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,303
But you are strong, are you not?

266
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,386
[all] Yes!

267
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,724
That's right.

268
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,520
You are strong.

269
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,064
Peace be upon you.

270
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,568
Peace be upon you, Sheikh.

271
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,695
How are you, my son?

272
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,074
Why do you call me your son?

273
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,826
I wish you were, Jibril.

274
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,621
God honors you.

275
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,084
And you have done great things,
despite your youth.

276
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:57,047
Everything you've done
for your nation... it's astonishing.

277
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,841
It wasn't just me.

278
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,762
I have heard otherwise. But, no matter.

279
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,641
Now...

280
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,727
Please, sit.

281
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:24,032
Do you have a sense of your plan,
in the future?

282
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,329
I will trust al-Masih's plan...

283
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,039
whatever it is.

284
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,086
My son, I'm not asking for his plan.
I'm asking for yours.

285
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,089
What is <i>your </i>will, Jibril?

286
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,719
My will?

287
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,148
[Staci] Hey.

288
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,817
You wanna play the license plate game?

289
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,068
- Huh?
- No.

290
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,448
When he was in the room with you...

291
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,033
what did he do?

292
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,327
I don't know.

293
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,998
- Can you tell me, honey?
- We just sat there.

294
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,211
How do you feel?

295
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,091
I wanna go home. I miss Daddy.

- A bit of a cliché, huh?
- Still managed to take us all by surprise.

307
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,946
God only knows what he'll do next.

308
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,614
Mm.

309
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,617
God knows. Exactly.

310
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,079

[chuckles]

312
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,418
If he was God,
he wouldn't need these parlor tricks.

00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,501
Uh...

314
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,089
That's all that Jesus did.

315
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,259
Right? Walked around, performed tricks.

316
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,677
Gets you an audience.

317
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,180
What was Jesus, after all?

318
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,393
Just a populist politician with an ax
to grind against the Roman Empire.

319
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,061
[laughs]

320
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,521
Wow.

321
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,731
Spoken like a true Jew.

322
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,869
He's connected to Russia.

323
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,708
You know this?

324
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,960
It's a theory.

[chuckles]

326
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,173
You have a lot of theories, huh?

327
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,924
You're so certain.

328
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:34,181
My mentor used to say
there's no room for doubt.

329
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,099
You can't blink.

330
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,396
Lives are at stake. You have
to see things as good or bad. Or...

331
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,814
black or white.

332
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,652
And you believe that?

333
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,655
Yeah.

334
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,119
So, what am I?

335
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,081
Am I a good guy or a bad guy?

[chuckles]

337
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:07,172
You know, I think you're just afraid
of being the bad guy.

338
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,883
Aren't we all?

339
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,554
So, how did your mentor survive all this?

340
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,515
He's dead.

00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,721
Vagabond, yes?

532
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,597
A trickster.

533
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,185
Sometimes, we would travel
with the circus, during the summers.

534
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:43,566
Other times, we'd busk in markets,
run scams. Pickpocket.

535
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,068
We would sleep on the street.

536
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,406
We were always ready to flee
with the rags on our backs.

537
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:56,287
He called himself "Yusuf the Magnificent."

538
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,872
[laughs]

539
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,459
Ah! Can you imagine? Magnificent!

540
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,254
He was proud and cruel.

541
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,675
Put us to work from the very beginning.
Pulled us from school.

542
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,758
Beat us.

543
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:14,305
But he also taught us everything he knew.

544
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,724
English.

545
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,434
Books.

546
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,062
The art of illusion.

547
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,780
Uncle Yusuf was a magician.

548
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:34,033
A master.

549
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,994
And we were his apprentices.

550
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,959
The trick... it's not so much
the mechanics of it.

551
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,254
That's just... practice.

552
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,507
The real trick...

553
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,931
is making you believe.

554
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,150
[bell tolling]

555
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,152
[paper tearing]

556
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,414
[siren wailing]

557
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,660
You're not sleeping in your car anymore?

558
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:00,619
No.

559
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,121
No, found a room.

560
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,039
- In a hotel?
- Yes.

561
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:06,166
- With running water?
- Yes.

562
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,878
Yes. Well, you won't believe it, actually.
It's this hotel.

563
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,921
Really?

564
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,967
[phone chiming]

565
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,391
Uh, what'd you get?

566
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,592
[scraping]
