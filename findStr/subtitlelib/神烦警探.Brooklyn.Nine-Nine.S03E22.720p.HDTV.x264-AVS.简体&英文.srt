What?

19
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:09,259
我把"皮门托"的每个字母以数字表示
I assigned a numerical value to each letter

20
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,560
再将其平方
in the word "Pimento," which I then squared.

21
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:12,629
警监
Oh, Captain.

22
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,830
你居然敢把数学掺和进来
How dare you try and sneak math into this?

23
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:16,199
佩拉尔塔
Peralta.

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,034

00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:21,838
但进展缓慢
but it's slowgoing.

27
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,138
我希望她能快点回来
I hope she comes back soon.

28
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:24,474
你想她了
You miss her?

29

不 我本来要帮她喂鱼
No, I lost the key to her apartment,

30
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,743
但我把她公寓的钥匙弄丢了
and I'm taking care of her fish.

31
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:27,911
它们已经都死了 是吧
They're all dead already, aren't they?

32
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:29,412
- 是 - 该死

00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:31,781
我们的首要目标仍然是找出菲吉斯在FBI的内线

老同事 鲍勃・安德森 帮个忙了
from an old colleague at the bureau, Bob Anderson.

36
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,955
我早就该联系他 但这毕竟是私自行动
I would've contacted him sooner, but this is a rogue op,

37
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,924
而他是个循规蹈矩的人
and he's a real stickler for the rules.

38
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:43,593
有一次他在街上捡到了一分钱 
He once picked up a penny off the street, which he then

39
00:00:43,594 --> 00:00:45,295
然后在报税时算进去了
reported on his taxes.

40
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:46,729
听起来是个有趣的人啊
Sounds like a barrel of laughs.

41
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,131
很幸运 他并不是
Fortunately, he isn't.

42
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,999
我们以前共事过 配合得很好

Would you like to talk?

45
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:56,706
还是别聊了
I'd rather not.

46
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:58,174
同意
Agreed.

47
00:01:18,195 --> 00:01:19,229
天啊
Oh, man.

48
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,797
跟联邦调查局的人秘密会面
A secret FBI meet up?

49
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:21,964
简直一级棒
I love this!

50
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,266
看看那些白痴
Look at all those idiots.

51
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:24,666
完全不知道将要发生什么
They have no idea what's about to go down.

52
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:26,168
你是说那个女人和她的小宝宝吗
You mean that woman and her baby?

53
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:27,469
对 白痴
Yep. Idiots.

54
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,305
鲍勃来了
Oh, here comes Bob.

55
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,707
别淘气
Please behave.

56
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:31,808
你好 鲍勃
Hello, Bob.

57
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:32,842
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

58
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,110
幸会 抱歉
And you. Apologies.

59
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:36,412
在尊驾手下警探面前
It's inappropriate for me to partake in such

60
00:01:36,413 --> 00:01:38,680
进行此等非正式交谈并不合适
informal conversation in front of your detectives.

61
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:40,949
不必过谦 在下亦当自责
It's all right. I am equally to blame.

62
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:42,418
天啊
Oh, my God.

63
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:43,853
他俩一样一样的
There's two of them.

64
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,121
那么 雷蒙德 你有什么证据证明
So, Raymond, what evidence do you have

65
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:46,788
联邦调查局内部有被买通的探员
that there's a dirty agent in the FBI?

66
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:47,891
拿卷宗来看看吧
Let's see the file.

67
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:49,057
我们没有卷宗
We don't have a file.

68
00:01:49,093 --> 00:01:50,292
你在无卷宗情况下工作
You're working file-less?

69
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:51,828
我们看到那人犯罪了
We saw the guy commit a felony.

70
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:53,263
他试图杀死一名警察
He tried to have a cop killed.

71
00:01:53,264 --> 00:01:55,063
性感到爆的警察
Crazy hot cop.

72
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:57,133
他属于很小众的类型
Well, he's a specific type.

73
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:59,402
我们要找的人当时带着滑雪面罩
Look, the guy we're looking for was wearing a ski mask,

74
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:00,904
身高约一米七八 白人
but he's about 5'10". Caucasian.

75
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:02,771
他右手上有个很大的疤
He's got a big scar on his right hand.

76
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,574
我们一直管他叫刀疤乔 就像女演员
We've been calling him ScarJo, like the actress,

77
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,209
斯嘉丽・约翰逊的简称
Scarlett Johansson.

78
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,343
什么 女演员
What? An actress?

79
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,913
我真不知道出处是这里
I didn't know that was where that was from.

80
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,713
鲍勃 我很抱歉
Bob, I'm so sorry.

81
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:14,583
- 没事 我就当没听见 - 好的
- No, I'll look past it. - Okay.

82
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,286
有个探员符合你们的描述
There's an agent that matches that description.

83
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:17,519
他名叫瑞安・ 惠伦
His name is Ryan Whealon.

84
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,155
如果你看到他 能认出来吗
You think you could ID him if you saw him?

85
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:22,357
能 我在二十英里开外都能认出来
Oh, yeah. I'd recognize that scar from 20 miles away.

86
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:23,959
你的视力一定特别好
You must have fantastic vision.

87
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:25,728
也可能是那条疤极其大
Or it's a gigantic scar.

88
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,763
我明显是在夸张
I was clearly exaggerating.

89
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:29,231
你们就不能配合一下吗
Why do you have to ruin everything?

90
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:32,901
施瓦茨医生 我按时来就诊了
Dr. Schwartz, I'm here for my appointment.

91
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:36,104
你好 科尔特斯 安息日平安
Hello, Cortez. Shabbat Shalom.

92
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,974
"安息日平安"
"Shabbat Shalom"?

93
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:40,043
没办法 杰克让我扮成犹太人
I don't know. Jake made me Jewish.

94
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:42,210
莫拉那边进展如何
So how are things going with Maura?

95
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,746
我现在是她手下了
Well, I'm part of her crew,

96
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,181
但她仍不肯提起她的过去
but she still won't talk about her past.

97
00:02:46,517 --> 00:02:48,750
你以前在纽约都干些什么啊
So, what kind of stuff did you used to do in New York?

98
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,499
你问这么多问题干嘛 雷吉斯
What's with all the questions, Regis?

99
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:52,084
其实现在是迈克・斯特拉恩主持了
Actually, it's Michael Strahan now.

100

啥
What?

101
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,857
她太吓人了
She's so scary.

102
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:57,960
我亲眼看到她把自己的牙拔下来扔到另一个女人的眼睛上
I saw her pull her own tooth out and throw it into a woman's eye.

103
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,029
太恐怖了 你猜怎么着
Yeah, that's bad. So guess what.

104
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,331
吉纳维芙刚来短信
Genevieve just texted.

105
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:03,298
我们的领养申请随时会有结果了
We're gonna hear about our adoption any minute.

106
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,134
你们不是去进行治疗了吗
I thought you were doing fertility treatments.

107
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:06,936
是去了 但不太顺利
We are, but it's not going well.

108
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,638
医生说我的不孕症太猛烈
The doctor said my sterility is so aggressive,

109
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,606
- 可能已经把她传染了 - 好吧
- it may have spread to her. - Okay.

110
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:13,643
但是 领养也很好啊 查尔斯 
But, adoption! Charles, that's amazing!

111
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:16,145
- 是啊 - 坏了
- I know! - Oh, no.

112
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:17,279
- 什么 - 莫拉
- What? - Maura.

113
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:22,752
总的说来 科尔特斯小姐 你的阴道看起来很棒
Anyway, Ms. Cortez, your vagina looks great.

114
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:23,786

没有 我都是通过
No. I get all my news

117
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:32,462
我朋友们的群发消息了解新闻的
from a text message chain with my friends.

118
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,164
司法部长可能要辞职了
The attorney general might step down!

119
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:37,900
逗你呢 是一张小兔子吃意面的动图
I'm kidding. It's a GIF of a rabbit eating spaghetti.

120
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:40,770
有一篇关于九九区月度犯罪率的文章
There's an article about the Nine-Nine's monthly crime rate.

121
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:43,338
那些数据本该是下周才公布的
Those numbers aren't supposed to be public until next week.

122
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:45,708
泰瑞 如果你想听到 "我去" 这两个字
Terry, you're gonna have to be more interesting

123
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,409
你得说点更有趣的
if you want to get an "Oh, dang."

124
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,224
九九区有人泄密了
There's a leak in the Nine-Nine!

125
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:50,413

我在一次晨会中公布过那些数据
I presented those numbers in a morning briefing,

127
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:55,685
但我想不出谁会笨到把它们泄露出去
but I can't imagine anyone would be stupid enough to leak 'em.

128
00:03:55,686 --> 00:03:58,020
真的吗 泰瑞斯 看看他们有多笨
Really, Terrence? Look how dumb they are.

You seem real tight with him.

153
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:08,190
不 没什么好的 一点都不熟
No, we're not tight. I barely know him.

154
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,458
那你干嘛要抱他
So why were you hugging him?

155
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:12,894
我的上诉被拒了 他在安慰我
My last appeal got denied, so he was comforting me.

156
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,098
他是个感性的人 可能因为他信犹太教吧
He's a sensitive guy. Maybe because of his Jewish faith.

157
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:18,935
我要跟他谈谈 单独谈
I want to talk to him. Alone.

158
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:22,438
是看病吗 还是...
Oh. About something medical? Or...

159
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,574
我是怎么跟你说问题太多的人来着
What did I tell you about asking too many questions?

160
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:28,811
对了 那是你杀了一群婊子的原因
Right. That's that thing you killed a bunch of bitches for.

161
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:31,079
知道了 对不起
Ah. Got it. Sorry.

162
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:34,150
我们已经监视他一整天了
We've been watching this guy all day.

163
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,618
真不敢相信居然还没逮捕他
Can't believe we haven't even arrested him yet.

164
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:36,786
明明已经确定是他了
We know he's the guy.

165
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,521
我们得先掌握证据
We have to build a case first.

166
00:05:38,522 --> 00:05:43,092
下午四点十三分 目标喝完了咖啡 或者是茶
4:13 p.M. Subject finishes his coffee. Or tea.

167
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,728
把饮料标记为"未知"
Mark the beverage as "Unknown."

168
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:46,763
警探们好
Detectives.

169
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,164
联邦调查局的数据库
What does the FBI database

170
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:50,065
有什么关于惠伦和菲吉斯的信息
tell us about Whealon and Figgis?

171
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,335
他们俩的档案全都被删除了
Both of their files were completely wiped.

172
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,468
我从没见过这种情况
I've never seen that before.

173
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:55,204
那是因为他有罪
Yeah, that's because he's guilty,

174
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:57,439
而我们只是坐在这看他吃桃子
and we're just sitting here watching him eat a peach.

175
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:58,473
那是个油桃
That's a nectarine.

176
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:00,409
不是油桃就是桃子
It's either a nectarine or a peach.

177
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,744
就写"未知有核水果"吧
Just write "Unknown stone fruit."

178
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,980
不可能只有电子档案的
There can't just be digital files.

179
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,213
肯定会有纸质档案
There must be hard copies.

180
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:07,383
那些都锁在档案室里
Those are all under lock and key in the archives.

181
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:09,152
如果我申请查阅 可能会打草惊蛇
If I asked for clearance, they could alert him.

182
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:10,453
有趣
Interesting.

183
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,622
照你这么说 我们只好
So what you're saying is our only option

184
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:16,091
闯入联邦调查局偷走档案
is to break into the FBI and steal the file.

185
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,160
别扯淡了
Don't be absurd.

186
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:19,661
鲍勃 我为他扯的淡向你道歉
Bob, I apologize for the absurdity.

187
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:21,164
我觉得不是扯淡
I see no absurdity.

188
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:23,633
实际上 我认为佩拉尔塔说得对
Actually, I think Peralta's right.

189
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,066
咱们来策划一起劫案吧
Let's plan a heist.

190
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,837
鲍勃
Bob?

191
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,288
联邦调查局纽约总部的设计图
Blueprints for the New York Headquarters of the FBI.

192
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,757
我们要找的资料
The file we're looking for

193
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:37,892
在档案室 这里 地下室
is in the archive room, here, in the basement.

194
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:42,464
就用我兜里的东西代表我们几个吧
We will be represented by these things I had in my pocket.

195
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:44,566
只有绒球 我兜里只有绒球
All I had was lint. Just a pocketful of lint.

196
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:47,435
大家都记住自己的绒球长啥样
Everybody remember what your lint looks like.

197
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,971
我的绒球是圆的
My lint is round.

198
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:52,341
我的绒球直径约一厘米
My lint is approximately 1 centimeter in diameter.

199
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:54,309
- 我的绒球是蓝色的 - 我的绒球是椭圆的
- My lint is blue. - My lint is oblong.

200
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,712
我的绒球长约半厘米
My lint is approximately 1/2 centimeter in length.

201
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:58,013
我的绒球也是蓝色的
My lint is also blue.

202
00:06:58,014 --> 00:07:00,749
都不反对用线头吗 那太好了
Wow, so no pushback on the lint thing? This is great.

203
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,950
我可以让你们顺利进入前门
Now, I can give you clearance to get in the front door,

204
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,220
但要进档案室又是另一回事了
but getting into the archive is another matter.

205
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:10,159
如果能进到这个卫生间 我就能顺着这个通风口
If I go into this bathroom, I could climb through this vent,

206
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,428
顺着爬到档案室 然后盗取文件
drop down into the archive room, and steal the file.

207
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:14,563
你怎么出来呢
How are you gonna get out?

208
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:17,099
爬上去原路返回
Pull myself back up the way I came in.

209
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,202
干嘛 我可以做引体向上 泰瑞会教我的
What? I can do a pull-up. Terry will teach me.

210
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:22,404
这整片区域都由这里的保卫
This whole area is video-monitored

211
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:23,505
视频监控
by this guard here.

212
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:24,773
我可以借聊天分散他的注意力
I can distract him with conversation.

213
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:25,874
你了解他什么情况吗
What do you know about him?

214
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,009
他看很多电视剧
Watches a lot of TV.

215
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,010
我听他提过《欲望都市》
I heard him mention "Sex and the City."

216
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:31,145
那我就跟他聊聊这两部剧
Then I will discuss both of those shows with him.

217
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:33,282
《欲望都市》是一部电视剧
Ooh. "Sex and the City" is one show.

218
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:34,550
不是一部叫《欲望》
It's not a show called "Sex"

219
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:36,350
另一部叫《都市》
and then another show called "The City."

220
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:37,386
好吧 开了个好头
Okay. Good start.

221
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:38,987
现在我就懂了
Now I know that.

222
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,389
我可以关掉监控录像
I can disable the security DVRs,

223
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,457
但我需要设法悄悄靠近操作台
but I need some way of getting to a station unnoticed.

224
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,059
我有个主意能把你偷偷送进去
I have an idea on how to smuggle you in,

225
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,359
不过会有点挤
but it'll be a tight fit.

226
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:46,562
我柔韧性很好 我练了很久瑜伽
I'm flexible. I do a lot of yoga.

227
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:47,963
你练瑜伽
You do yoga?

228
00:07:47,964 --> 00:07:49,531
有助我集中注意力 要是你再问一次
Helps keep me centered. If you ask me about it again,

229
00:07:49,532 --> 00:07:50,966
我会追杀你然后把你脸皮撕掉
I'll hunt you down and rip your face off.

230
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:52,734
行 很好 好计划 我不会再问了
Okay. Great. Good plan. I won't ask you about it again.

231
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:54,036
我负责搞定监控
I got the DVRs.

232
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:57,906
实际上 那是我的绒球 我的绒球是椭圆形的
Actually, that's my lint. My lint is oblong.

233
00:07:57,907 --> 00:07:59,441
我的绒球是蓝色的
My lint is blue.

234
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:01,742
好了 看来我们已经做好了计划 那就开始训练吧
Okay! Sounds like we've got a plan. Let's get to training.

235
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:02,978
她为什么要见我
Why does she want to meet with me?

236
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,613
你觉得我们暴露了吗
You think our cover's blown?

237
00:08:05,648 --> 00:08:07,115
我不知道 不过为了安全起见
I don't know, but, just to be safe,

238
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:08,550
我们来复习下你的背景故事
let's review your backstory.

239
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:12,120
我上的是叶史瓦医学院 在西奈山医院做住院医
I went to Yeshiva med school, residency at Mount Sinai,

240
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:13,555
我最好的朋友是杰科比・佩尔贝格
my best friend is Yacob Peralberg,

241
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,022
我们对彼此畅无不言
and we share everything with each other.

242
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:17,392
没想到会有最后这部分 不过还行
Can't imagine that last part coming up, but okay.

243
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,393
你行的
You got this.

244
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:19,761
伊莎贝尔
Well, Isabel,

245
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:22,431
你的胎儿头部大小正好
your baby's head is the perfect size.

246
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:25,000
谢谢 大夫
Oh, thank you, doctor.

247
00:08:25,001 --> 00:08:28,636
不过生产的时候还是会痛的 做好准备吧
Still gonna hurt when it comes out. Get ready for that.

248
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,339
你就是施瓦茨医生
So you're Dr. Schwartz.

249
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,040
是我 你好啊 我能为你效劳吗
That's me. L'chaim. How can I help you?

250
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:35,444
从你一露面我就在观察你
I've been watching you ever since you showed up here.

251
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:38,013
你似乎跟以前那些医生都不一样
You don't seem like the other doctors that we've had.

252
00:08:38,014 --> 00:08:41,383
有趣... 我最好的朋友杰科比也常这么说
It's funny... my best friend, Yacob, is always saying that.

253
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:42,985
废话少说
Cut the crap.

254
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:46,053
- 你我都清楚我来这的原因 - 是吗
- We both know why I'm here. - We do?

255
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:48,357
你的心跳已超速
Your heart's beating a mile a minute.

256
00:08:48,358 --> 00:08:50,124
并不是因为我紧张了
It's not because I'm nervous!

257
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,395
科尔特斯说你很感性 我喜欢
Cortez says that you're sensitive. I like that.

258
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:55,197
我只跟骗人的渣男在过一起
I've only been with cheating scum.

259
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:57,299
直到现在
Until now.

260
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:00,935
出什么事了吗
Everything okay in here?

261
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,070
- 没事 - 一切正常
- Yeah. - We're all good.

262
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:03,739
他刚在给我检查身体
He was just checking me out.

263
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,207
我会很快再来的 医生
And I will see you soon, doctor?

264
00:09:05,208 --> 00:09:07,175
回见
Later.

265
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:08,610
回见
Yeah. Later.

266
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:11,279
都怪这个完美的屁股
Curse this perfect butt.

267
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:13,047
你怎么能这么说 长官
How dare you, sir?

268
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:15,449
你真的以为我们会故意泄露消息吗
Do you really think we would leak information on purpose?

269
00:09:15,485 --> 00:09:18,419
不 我们认为你们两个笨蛋无意中说漏了
No. We think you're dum-dums and you did it by accident.

270
00:09:18,454 --> 00:09:20,155
好吧 那倒是很有可能
Oh. Well, that's very possible.

271
00:09:20,156 --> 00:09:21,356
是 我觉得也是
Yeah, I could see that.

272
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:22,724
那次晨会是一周前开的
The briefing was a week ago.

273
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:25,293
告诉我们你们之后接触过的所有人
Just tell us everyone you talked to since then.

274
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:28,730
我想想 星期六 我跟朋友们聚会
Well, let's see. On Saturday, I got together with my friends,

275
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:30,032
我们去看了赛狗
and we went to the dog track.

276
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:31,899
名字写下来
We need names.

277
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,702
我撒谎了 其实没几个朋友
I lied. There's not multiple friends.

278
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,671
只有斯库利
It's just Scully.

279
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:38,173
好吧 那你呢 斯库利
Okay. What about you, Scully?

280
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:39,741
我跟一个兄弟去看了纽约尼克斯队的比赛
Well, I went to the Knicks game with a buddy.

281
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:42,576
这个兄弟是不是叫希区柯克
Was this "Buddy" named Hitchcock?

282
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:43,912
是的 而且我们没看球赛
Yes, and we weren't at the game.

283
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:45,212
我们是去看了赛狗
We were at the dog track.

284
00:09:45,248 --> 00:09:46,982
拜托 伙计们
Oh, come on, guys.

285
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:49,583
你们还可能跟什么人聊过犯罪数据
Is there anyone you could've told the crime stats to?

286
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,553
- 犯罪数据 - 等等 你俩有谁
- Crime stats? - Wait. Do either of you

287
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:56,058
知道我们的逮捕人数吗
even know what our arrest numbers were?

288
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:57,359
- 十二个 - 不对
- 12. - No!

289
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,461
- 那就不知道 - 不是他们泄露的
- Then no. - Yeah, they're not the leak.

290
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:06,101
加油 伙计 运用你的肌肉
Come on, man. Use your muscles.

291
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,470
运用我的肌肉 太好了
Use my muscles? Oh, great.

292
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:09,638
为什么我就没想到呢
Why didn't I think about that?

293
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,105
好建议 泰瑞
Great advice, Terry.

294
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,407
这只不过是引体向上而已
You know what? It's a pull-up.

295
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:13,808
根本没什么好教的
There's not much to coach here.

296
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:17,812
人物有凯莉 米兰达 夏洛特和萨曼莎
So there's Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha,

297
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:21,049
不过纽约其实是第五个人物
but New York City is really the fifth character.

298
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,553
史蒂夫呢 他似乎是个好人
Hmm. What about Steve? He seems nice.

299
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:27,522
史蒂夫什么也不是 没人喜欢史蒂夫
Oh, Steve is nothing. No one likes Steve.

300
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:28,522
"史蒂夫什么也不是"
"Steve is nothing."

301
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:33,694
好吧
Okay!

302
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,201
我不懂了 米兰达本来可以跟布莱尔・安德伍德在一起的
I don't get it. Miranda could've had Blair Underwood,

303
00:10:39,202 --> 00:10:40,501
但她却跟了史蒂夫
but she settled for Steve?

304
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:43,504
你其实搞懂了 长官 看 你现在就懂了
Oh, but you do get it, sir. See, now you do.

305
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,841
你那么做对我有什么帮助
How is you doing that helping me?

306
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:51,880
- 斯库利 - 罗莎
- Scully. - Rosa.

307
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:00,722
很棒 你能安静地做一个吗
Good job. Can you do it without screaming?

308
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:03,458
也... 许... 吧
Pro-bab-ly.

309
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:04,493
那我们准备好了
Then we're ready.

310
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:06,094
我们去闯联邦调查局吧
Let's break into the FBI.

311
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:08,096
不是吧 警监 这么重要的时刻
Oh, come on, Captain. This is such a big moment.

312
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:09,331
语气再热烈一点
Say it with more gusto.

313
00:11:09,332 --> 00:11:11,099
的确 应该这样
Indeed. Like this:

314
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,968
我们去闯联邦调查局
let's break into the FBI.

315
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:14,136
我懂了
Oh, I see.

316
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:15,504
我们去闯联邦调查局
Let's break into the FBI.

317
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:17,505
不对 我们去闯联邦调查局
No. Let's break into the FBI.

318
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,840
我们去闯联邦调查局
Let's break into the FBI.

319
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,375
我们去闯联邦调查局
Let's break into the FBI.

320
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,243
我们去闯联邦调查局 我觉得不错了
Let's break into the FBI. I feel like I'm doing it.

321
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:23,512
我们去闯联邦调查局
Let's break into the FBI.

322
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:24,746
我们去闯联邦调查局
Let's break into the FBI.

323
00:11:24,747 --> 00:11:27,082
好了 我觉得可以了
Okay! I think we got it.

324
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,383
现在
Now,

325
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:31,018
我们去闯联邦调查局啦
let's break into the FBI!

326
00:11:39,027 --> 00:11:40,527
早上好
Good morning.

327
00:11:46,768 --> 00:11:49,102
- 你好 这是你的 - 谢谢
- Hi. This is for you. - Thanks.

328
00:11:49,103 --> 00:11:50,971
你这分量可不轻啊
Quite a big package you've got there.

329
00:11:50,972 --> 00:11:53,573
抱歉 我用了双关语
Oh, I apologize for the double entendre.

330
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:54,941
我真像萨曼莎
I can be such a Samantha.

331
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:56,209
真的吗
Really?

332
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,477
你看起来可不像萨曼莎
You don't seem like a Samantha.

333
00:11:57,478 --> 00:12:00,013
其实我是
Well, I'm actually a combination

334
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:01,674
四人的合体
of all four characters.

335
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,216
如果把纽约市算在内的话就是五人
Five if you count the city of New York.

336
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:04,718
没错
Yes.

337
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,285
你也是《欲望都市》脑残粉吗
Another Sex-and-the-Citiot?

338
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:08,322
我认罪
Guilty as charged.

339
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:11,224
我最喜欢的是第三季
My favorite season has to be the third one.

340
00:12:11,225 --> 00:12:12,726
凯莉当时顺风顺水
Everything was going right for Carrie.

341
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:15,796
她的照片上了公交车 专栏也成了热门话题
Her face was on every bus, her column was the talk of the town,

342
00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:18,765
她还认识了大家最爱的家具制造商
and she met everyone's favorite furniture maker,

343
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:20,334
艾登・肖
Aidan Shaw.

344
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,375
当然 他想带她见父母时
Sure, she melted down when he tried to introduce her

345
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:25,105
她崩溃了 然后当她撞见
to his parents, and she flipped out

346
00:12:25,106 --> 00:12:26,907
新婚的大人物和娜塔莎从出租车里出来时
when she bumped into Big getting out of that cab

347
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:29,142
她都快气疯了
with Natasha, whom he had married.

348
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:31,110
也不能怪她
Hmm. Who can blame her?

349
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:32,813
他们几乎不了解对方
They barely knew each other.

350
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:34,541
那一季最好看的一集...
The best episode that year...

351
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,185
是第六集 标题是《我们是荡妇吗》
was episode six, entitled "Are We Sluts?"

352
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:40,087
就那集 凯莉满脑子都在想
You know the one. Carrie was all in her head

353
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:41,822
她和艾登没发生关系
because she and Aidan weren't having sex.

354
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:42,855
与此同时 在城市另一边
Meanwhile, across town,

355
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,558
夏洛特沉溺在性爱中无法自拔
Charlotte couldn't stop having sex.

356
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,595
还有萨曼莎 萨曼莎还是老样子
And Samantha? Samantha was just being Samantha.

357
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:52,475
那一季的最后一集题目是《喔喔喔》
The season finale that year was entitled "Cock-a-Doodle-Do."

358
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,470
喔喔喔 收到
Cock-a-doodle-doo. Roger that.

359
00:12:57,739 --> 00:12:58,905
哎呀
Whoops.

360
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:00,608
我讨厌大人物
I hate Big!

361
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:03,343
凯莉本来应该跟米哈伊・巴瑞辛尼科夫在一起的
Carrie should've ended up with Mikhail Baryshnikov.

362
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:05,905
什么 他扇了她耳光 你傻吗
What? He slapped her! Are you insane?

363
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:13,887
搞定
Bingo.

364
00:13:13,888 --> 00:13:17,457
拿到文件了 准备撤离
Got the file. Preparing for extraction.

365
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,960
不许出声 佩拉尔塔
No screaming, Peralta.

366
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,869
要我说的话 他们根本就不该拍电影
If you ask me, they never should've made the movie.

367
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,764
什么阿布达比 可别费事了
Abu Dhabi? Abu don't bother.

368
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:34,240
这个笑话我用得着
Wow. I'm gonna use that.

369
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,808
- 请尽管用 祝你愉快 - 好的
- Please do. Have a nice day. - Okay.

370
00:13:38,446 --> 00:13:39,913
给你
Hey. Here you go.

371
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:41,981
等一下 站住 你们两个
Whoa, wait. Hold on. Stop. Both of you.

372
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:45,111
那个通行证只能进九楼
That pass is only for the ninth floor.

373
00:13:45,119 --> 00:13:46,753
好了 我要检查那个信封
All right. Let me see that envelope.

374
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:49,322
实际上 我不能给你看 因为...
Oh, actually, I can't show you that, because...

375
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:51,391
没事
It's okay.

376
00:13:51,392 --> 00:13:54,127
是我叫他下来寄东西的
I asked him to come down and mail that.

377
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:56,930
我只要把回邮地址写上去
I just need to put my return address on it.

378
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:59,765
来 给你
And... there you go.

379
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,002
谢谢 我知道应该放到哪里
Thanks. I know just where to put that.

380
00:14:02,003 --> 00:14:04,638
我又萨曼莎上身了
Oh! There's Samantha again.

381
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:21,121
我们成功了
Whoo-hoo-hoo! We did it!

382
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:22,155
怎么 我只是个凡人
What? I'm only human.

383
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:23,890
你不能总是指望
You can't always expect me

384
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:25,124
我做史上最冷静之人
to be the coolest guy ever.

385
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:28,728
史上最冷静之人 跟艾伦・格林斯潘说去吧
Coolest guy ever? Try telling that to Alan Greenspan.

386
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:30,697
吐槽得好 鲍勃
Nice burn, Bob!

387
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:31,865
我应该料到莫拉
I should've known Maura

388
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:33,299
控制不了自己
wouldn't be able to control herself.

389
00:14:33,334 --> 00:14:35,469
强势的女人总是会被我吸引
Strong women, they're just drawn to me.

390
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,803
她们都像直角那么直
You know, they're all right angles,

391
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:38,498
而我却像曲线那样平滑
and I'm nothing but curves.

392
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:40,140
这其实是件好事 伯耶尔
This actually could be great, Boyle.

393
00:14:40,141 --> 00:14:42,776
你可以借机引诱她开口 不过
You could romance her into talking, but you shouldn't

394
00:14:42,777 --> 00:14:44,276
如果你反感的话 那就算了
do anything that you're not comfortable with.

395
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,546
不 我不反感 又不会有身体接触
Oh, no. No, I won't have to. It's not gonna get physical.

396
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:50,083
诱惑的艺术就在于让上钩的人一直候着
You see, the art of seduction is all about making people wait.

397
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,384
- 对 - 我和吉纳维芙
- Right. - Genevieve and I

398
00:14:51,385 --> 00:14:52,719
在做爱之前通常...
often begin our lovemaking sessions...

399
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,954
行了
Oh. Okay.

400
00:14:53,955 --> 00:14:55,255
都会聊好几个小时
With hours upon hours of delicateness...

401
00:14:55,256 --> 00:14:56,590
- 好了 别说了 - 这样会激起...
- Okay. Please stop. - That kind of blow...

402
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,558
警卫
Guard!

403
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,126
- 你明白吧 - 明白了
- You get it. - All right. Yeah.

404
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:03,163
好的  勾人欲望的歌单 有了
All right. Sexy playlist. Check.

405
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:05,298
诱人的声音 也有
Seductive voice. Double check.

406
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:09,870
嘿 花栗鼠
Hey, chipmunk.

407
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:12,539
- 我们来吧 - 好啊
- Let's do this. - That sounds fun.

408
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,842
但先让我签一些表格
But first, I need to sign some charts,

409
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:20,780
因为我是名非常 好的 医生
because I am a really... good... doctor.

410
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,315
赶紧把你的翘臀送过来

411
00:15:23,351 --> 00:15:25,117
好 我会的
Oh, I will!

412
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:28,155
谁是吉纳维芙
Who is Genevieve?

413
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:30,823
没谁
No one!

414
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:32,124
是我的脊椎按摩师
My chiropractor.

415
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,727
- 那接电话吧 - 接电话 
- Then answer it. - Answer it?

416
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:35,495
可是我们何不享受此时此刻
I mean, why don't we just stay in the moment?

417
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:37,764
为什么要拘泥于这些小盒子
Why are you such a slave to these little boxes?

418
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:40,799
接电话 开扩音
Answer the phone, and put it on speaker.

419
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:43,236
你好
Hello?

420
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:45,005
亲爱的 领养申请已经批准了
Honey, the adoption papers went through!

421
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:46,339
你要成为父亲了
You're gonna be a daddy!

422
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,276
我的天 我要有孩子了
Oh, my God! I'm having a baby!

423
00:15:49,277 --> 00:15:52,212
你打错了 别再打过来了
I mean... this is the wrong number. Don't call here again!

424
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:53,380
你死定了
You're dead.

425
00:15:53,381 --> 00:15:55,481
是你死定了 求你别打我 
Maybe you're dead. Please don't hurt me.

426
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:00,053
在干嘛 警长
Sup, Sarge?

427
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:02,289
像正常人一样挖垃圾吗
Just digging through the garbage like a normal person?

428
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,250
我在查谁是泄密者
I'm trying to find out who our leak is.

429
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:06,293
你怎么就这么确定有人泄密
What makes you so sure that there's a leak?

430
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:08,762
也许只是那个记者很称职呢
It might've just been that the reporter was really good

431
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:12,031
就像TMZ八卦网那个性感的金发冲浪者一样
at his job, like that hot blond surfer was at TMZ?

432
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:13,199
可能是你泄露的
Maybe you leaked it.

433
00:16:13,234 --> 00:16:14,469
什么
Excuse me?

434
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:17,337
我不是说你有意泄露
I'm not saying you did it on purpose.

435
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:19,773
你可能把文件落在地铁上了
Maybe you left the file on the subway.

436
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:22,576
你工作态度不是很严谨
I mean, you don't take your job very seriously.

437
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:23,977
哇 现在我们要
Whoa. We're about to have

438
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:25,879
像两口子一样吵架了吗 泰瑞斯
our first fight as a couple, Terrence.

439
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,615
首先 我有很认真工作
First of all, I take my job very seriously.

440
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:30,283
因此我才会在这里帮你
That's why I'm here right now, helping you,

441
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,885
而且只有我一个人帮你
and I'm the only one doing it.

442
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:35,222
直到你侮辱我之前都是
Or, I was, until you insulted me.

443
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:36,723
现在看我离去的背影吧
Now watch me walk away.

444
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:43,896
我说了看着我
I said watch me!

445
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:46,533
难怪惠伦清除了数据
Wow. No wonder Whealon wiped the database.

446
00:16:46,534 --> 00:16:48,068
看这里
Look at this.

447
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:50,737
他终止了FBI和纽约警局
He quashed all FBI and NYPD operations

448
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:52,071
与菲吉斯有关的所有行动
relating to Figgis...

449
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:54,274
贩毒 绑架 谋杀
drug running, kidnapping, murder...

450
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:56,409
多重要的案子啊 为什么你们要终止调查
those are the best crimes; why would you quash them?

451
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,912
等待的时间已经结束
Time for waiting is over.

452
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,512
现在是时候直击对方要害了
Now is the time for groin-stomping.

453
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:02,148
对 正是如此
Damn right, it is!

454
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:04,551
我们去抓那个臭小子
Let's go arrest that punk.

455
00:17:04,552 --> 00:17:06,151
他说"臭小子"的口气好像你
He says "Punk" Just like you.

456
00:17:06,187 --> 00:17:09,421
你以为他是跟谁学的 臭小子
Where do you think he learned it, punk?

457
00:17:11,792 --> 00:17:13,693
纽约警察
NYPD!

458
00:17:13,694 --> 00:17:15,395
- 有人来过这里 - 尸体
- Somebody's been here. - A body!

459
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:17,364
- 发现尸体 - 该死的
- We got a body! - Damn it!

460
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:19,566
他死了 菲吉斯先找到他了
He's dead. Figgis got to him.

461
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:21,234
等等 他还有脉搏
Wait a minute. He's got a pulse.

462
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:22,669
不 等等 是我的脉搏
No, wait. That's my pulse.

463
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,471
不 是他的脉搏 不对 是我俩的
No. It's his pulse. Nope, it's both our pulses.

464
00:17:24,472 --> 00:17:28,341
他还没死 我也没死 我们都没死
He's alive! I'm alive! We're all alive!

465
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:29,942
这案子要真相大白了
This case just got busted wide open.

466
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,641
好消息
Good news.

467
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:35,074
医生说惠伦不会死
The doctors say Whealon's not gonna die.

468
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:37,411
谢天谢地 但愿他受尽痛苦折磨
Thank God. I just hope he's in a lot of pain.

469
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:39,980
他们说惠伦会在十二小时内醒过来
They say he'll be out of the coma within 12 hours.

470
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,615
太好了 他绝对会指证菲吉斯
Great. That means he'll definitely testify

471
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:43,584
而这也就意味着
against Figgis, and you know what that means:

472
00:17:43,585 --> 00:17:46,219
是时候来条巧克力棒庆祝一下
time for celebration candy bars!

473
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:47,787
医院那些辣鸡自动贩卖机
Stupid hospital vending machines

474
00:17:47,822 --> 00:17:49,989
不知为啥都不卖酒 来一条
didn't have alcohol for some weird reason. Here.

475
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:53,427
有何不可 我今天真想放纵一回
Why not? I really have embraced my wild side today.

476
00:17:53,428 --> 00:17:54,929
我也是
As have I.

477
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,131
坚果巧克力
Chocolate and nuts.

478
00:17:57,132 --> 00:17:58,564
还是有点过分了
Actually, that's overkill.

479
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,667
太过分了
Indeed.

480
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,235
我在这里等
I'll wait here,

481
00:18:01,236 --> 00:18:02,835
这样他一醒我就能问他话
so I can interrogate him when he wakes up.

482
00:18:02,871 --> 00:18:04,171
我和你一起
I'll keep you company.

483
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:05,940
你们两个回家洗洗睡吧
Why don't you two go home and get some sleep?

484
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,074
好 长官
Good idea, sir.

485
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:08,309
我们先去酒吧喝得烂醉
We'll head to the bar, get super drunk,

486
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,543
然后回家倒头大睡
and then head home and get some sleep.

487
00:18:09,544 --> 00:18:11,044
对 好主意 长官
Yeah. Good idea, sir.

488
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:16,349
事实证明 你那个感性的医生并不是那么回事
Turns out your sensitive doctor isn't who he says he is.

489
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:18,284
什么 你什么意思 怎么说
What? What do you mean? Why?

490
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,287
因为他和他的脊椎按摩师要一起领养孩子
'Cause he's about to adopt a baby with his chiropractor.

491
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:23,623
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God...

492
00:18:23,658 --> 00:18:26,893
你不用再为这段感情 这个混蛋
that you didn't invest more time in a relationship

493
00:18:26,928 --> 00:18:28,696
投入更多时间
with that jerk.

494
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:30,330
我怎么就找不到好男人呢
Why can't I find a good man?

495
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:32,333
也许是因为你因谋杀而入狱
Could be because you're in prison for murder.

496
00:18:32,334 --> 00:18:34,534
- 不可能 才不是 - 对 绝对不是
- Nah. That's not it. - Yeah, that's not it.

497
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:37,938
进来之前 我和我哥帮派里的朋友
Before this, I used to date all my brother's friends

498
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:39,006
全都约过
from the mob.

499
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,941
狗也是
All dogs too.

500
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:42,742
算了 你不想听这些的
Never mind. You don't want to hear about them.

501
00:18:42,777 --> 00:18:45,045
不 我想听
No! I do want to hear about them.

502
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:48,181
来吧 全都说给我听
Please. Tell me everything about them.

503
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:51,819
谢了 你真好
Thanks. That would be nice.

504
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,787
啊 你不喜欢别人碰你 明白
Ahh! Not a toucher. Totally get it.

505
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,456
我会管好自己的手
I'll keep my hands to myself.

506
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:57,924
怎么样了 警长 找到泄密的人了吗
What's going on, Sarge? You find that leak yet?

507
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,527
是啊 我躲在咖啡机后 监视办公室里的每一个人
Yes. I'm hiding behind a coffeemaker, spying on everyone

508
00:19:00,528 --> 00:19:02,428
因为我已经找到泄密的人了
in this office, because I found the leak.

509
00:19:02,464 --> 00:19:05,399
哎呀 泰瑞 冷嘲热讽的形象真的不适合你
Aww, Terry. Sarcasm is not a good look on you.

510
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,134
但你知道什么适合你吗
But you know what would be?

511
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,204
- 紧身的亨利衫 - 真是谢谢你了
- A really tight Henley. - Very helpful.

512
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,504
我知道是谁泄密了
I know who your leak is.

513
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:12,906
啥
What?

514
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:15,275
我查了那个报道犯罪数据的记者		
I looked up the reporter who published the crime numbers,

515
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:17,577
我发现你们俩互相关注了
and I noticed you two follow each other online.

516
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:19,613
是他先关注我的 你也知道
He followed me, and you know I'm

517
00:19:19,614 --> 00:19:22,181
我这人最喜欢回粉
a proud member of team follow-back.

518
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:23,417
所以我查了你的主页
So I went through your feed

519
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:24,718
看看你都发了什么
to see what you were posting.

520
00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:27,487
很多你孩子的照片 并没有人在意
Lots of pictures of your kids. Nobody cares.

521
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:30,557
然后我发现了上周你发的这张图
And then I found this picture you posted last week.

522
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:33,527
"享受#优格 生活"
"Living that #YOGURT life."

523
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,294
真是无语
Embarrassing.

524
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,498
不过泰瑞 更让人无语的是
But what's even more embarrassing, Terry,

525
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:42,035
逮捕人数就在照片上 写得清清楚楚
is that the arrest numbers are in the photo, clear as day.

526
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,871
我的天
Oh, my God!

527
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,340
是我泄露的
I was the leak!

528
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:47,541
我得删掉那张照片
I got to take that picture down.

529
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:50,477
吉娜 很抱歉我错怪你了
Gina, I am so sorry I blamed you.

530
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:52,679
我早就知道你会这么说
And I knew you would say something like that,

531
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,515
所以我提前替你给自己
so I went ahead and bought myself a cake

532
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:55,816
买了个蛋糕
on your behalf.

533
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:57,884
瞧
Check it out.

534
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,252
我去
Oh, dang.

535
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:01,822
这蛋糕都放在这里半小时了 警探大人
And this has been here for the last half-hour, detective.

536
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:03,290
居然都没察觉
Didn't even notice it.

537
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,093
天哪 老是要帮别人做事 真受不了
God, I'm so sick of doing everyone's job for them.

538
00:20:06,094 --> 00:20:08,094
谁来帮我一点忙啊
It's like, help me out a little bit.

539
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:10,163
百年都难得一次
Just once in a blue moon.

540
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:11,665
我们做到了
Well, we did it.

541
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:12,866
有那么一瞬间 我还以为
For a second there, I didn't think

542
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:14,101
我们完不成任务了
we were going to pull it off.

543
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:16,636
- 我知道我们可以 - 我们也是 干杯
- I knew we could. - And we did. To us!

544
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:18,171
你们俩在庆祝什么
Oh. What are you guys celebrating?

545
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:19,773
泰瑞对我们乱发脾气 但我们
Terry was mad at us, but we didn't know

546
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:21,575
不知道他在说什么 然后他就走了
what he was talking about, and he went away.

547
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:23,744
真是个大日子 
Huge day.

548
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:27,147
是艾米
It's Amy.

549
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:28,448
嘿 亲爱的
Hey, girlfriend.

550
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:29,683
杰克 莫拉跟我说了
Jake, Maura told me

551
00:20:29,684 --> 00:20:31,717
FBI里为菲吉斯办事的那个人
who Figgis has working for him in the FBI.

552
00:20:31,753 --> 00:20:32,986
我已经知道是谁了
Yeah, I already know who it is,

553
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:34,521
因为我刚刚抓到他了
because I just caught him:

554
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:36,123
是特工瑞安・ 惠伦
Special Agent Ryan Whealon.

555
00:20:36,124 --> 00:20:38,258
我还做了个引体向上呢
Also, I did one full pull-up.

556
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:39,927
等你回来我就成猛男了
I'm gonna be so buff when you get back.

557
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:41,894
酷 宝贝 你们抓到另一个人了吗
Cool, babe. Did you get the other guy?

558
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,497
- 什么另一个人 - 名叫鲍勃・安德森的家伙
- What other guy? - Someone named Bob Anderson.

559
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,835
鲍勃
Bob?

560
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:48,969
我的天
Oh, my God.

561
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,371
艾米 我得挂了
Amy, I have to go.

562
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:53,640
- 鲍勃在给菲吉斯办事 - 什么
- Bob is working for Figgis. - What?

563
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:55,642
肯定就是他删掉了电子档案
He must've been the one who deleted all those digital files.

564
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:57,010
他还想杀掉惠伦
And he tried to have Whealon killed.

565
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:58,245
可他帮我们盗取了文件
But he helped us with the heist,

566
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,813
而且他的档案也没什么异样
and there was nothing about him in the paper file.

567
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:01,849
因为那份不是真的档案
Yeah, because that wasn't the real file.

568
00:21:02,984 --> 00:21:06,053
我只要把回邮地址写上去
I just need to put my return address on it.

569
00:21:06,054 --> 00:21:08,722
来 给你
And... there you go.

570
00:21:08,723 --> 00:21:10,390
谢谢
Oh, thank you.

571
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,891
我们得联系霍尔特
We have to call Holt.

572
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:17,064
快 警监 快接啊 
Come on, Captain. Pick up. Pick up.

573
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:22,736
别接电话 雷蒙德
Don't answer that, Raymond.

574
00:21:22,737 --> 00:21:25,405
我现在不得不杀了你
And now I'm going to have to kill you.

575
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:27,649
噢 鲍勃
Oh, Bob.
