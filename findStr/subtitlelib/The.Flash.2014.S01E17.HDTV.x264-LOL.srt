00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:57,574
Who are you?

717
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,976
My name is Eobard Thawne,

718
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:02,579
But that name
doesn't matter.

719
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,714
Not anymore.
It won't matter for many years.

720
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:08,518
The only thing that really
matters is who you are.

721
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,120
Harrison Wells.

722
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,122
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

723
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:16,726
In the year 2020,
you and your wife, Tess Morgan,

724
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,162
Successfully launched
a particle accelerator

725
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,930
That changed the course
of history.

726
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:24,134
I need it to happen a bit sooner
if I'm going to get back.

727
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:27,704
Much sooner.

728
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,340
- What is that?
- My way home.

729
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,776
[police sirens approaching]

730
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:36,946
You see, they're not coming
to save you.

731
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:41,051
They're coming to save me.

732
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:41,851
[grunts]

733
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:45,055
[sirens continue]

734
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,293
[grunting]

735
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,067
[both screaming]

736
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,185
[exhales]

737
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,695
Hey, Joe.

738
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,230
Desk sergeant said
you were looking for me.

739
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,899
Eddie, yeah.
Uh...

740
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,406
Sit down.

741
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:39,642
It's about Iris.

742
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,145
She's looking into
Mason Bridge's disappearance.

743
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:44,080
We can't let that happen.

744
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,021
Detective.

745
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:10,306
Eddie, we need your help.

746
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,912
Brazil?

747
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,683
Why... why would
Mason move to Brazil?

748
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:22,952
Apparently there was
a girl involved,

749
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:27,757
And he decided to go hike
the amazon with her for a year,

750
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,459
You know,
live off the grid,

751
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,894
Write his memoirs
or something.

752
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,763
Wow. I guess you really
don't know anyone.

753
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,765
No, you don't.

754
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,066
(West)
Hey, baby, everything good?

755
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,768
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

756
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,604
Um, dinner will be ready
in a jiff, okay?

757
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,072
Okay.

758
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,146
She buy it?

759
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,015
I think so.

760
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,150
Keeping her in the dark,
it's for her safety.

761
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:57,487
That is debatable,
and we will have that debate.

762
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,623
But for right now,
what's our next move?

763
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,560
How do we figure out
what wells is up to?

764
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:07,997
When wells was talking me
through phasing

765
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,567
So I could get the trickster's
bomb off my wrist,

766
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:14,804
The way that he described
my being The Flash, running,

767
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:19,776
Feeling the wind
and the power,

768
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:23,446
It's like he was talking
from experience.

769
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:24,681
What are you saying?

770
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,316
I don't know how...

771
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,052
But he's the man
in yellow.

772
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:32,555
Harrison Wells
is The Reverse-Flash.

773
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,528
I got an 11-80,
possible 10-54,

774
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,431
County Road J,
requesting immediate assistance.

775
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:44,567
(man on radio)
Copy that.
Units en route to your location.

776
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:47,070
[grunting]

777
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,172
Sir, we're gonna get you
out of here.

778
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,540
Can you tell me
your name?

779
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:54,277
Do you know
who you are?

780
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,713
My name...

781
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:59,616
Is...

782
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:03,386
Harrison Wells.

Greg, move your head.
