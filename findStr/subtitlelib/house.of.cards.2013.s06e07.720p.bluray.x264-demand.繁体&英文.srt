45
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,920
我都沒有參與

46
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,120

00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,680
那你為什么沒有合法收養我
Why didn't you legally adopt me?

49
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,050
他不是咱家的人
He's not one of us.

50
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,230

You're a coward.

我希望你快死
Well, I hope you die.

60
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,100
痛苦分兩種
There are two kinds of pain.

61
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,580
一種讓你變得更強
The sort of pain that makes you strong.

62
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,350
另一種毫無價值
Or useless pain...

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,440
只是徒添折磨
the sort of pain that's only suffering.

64
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,670
我對沒價值的東西也沒耐心
I have no patience for useless things.

65
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,600
我回頭望向她
I turn around and see her,

66
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,040
我親愛的妻子  倚靠在前廊上
my darling wife, poised on the front stoop.

67
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,980
她肯定都看見了
Surely she saw everything.

68
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,290
所有的殺戮  相關的謊言  但她未置一詞
The killing, the lying about it, but doesn't say a word.

69
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,110
她只是若無其事地回到房子里
She just enters the house in quiet compliance.

70
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,590
這就是愛
This is love.

71
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,980
每個人都應該
Everyone should be so--

72
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,620
我親愛的同胞們
My beloved Americans.

73
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,860
我現在百感交集
My heart is very full today.

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,060
我今天來談談未來
I am here to talk about the future.

75
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,470
未來已經變得極度私人化
And the future has become very personal.

76
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,120
我們聚集在偉大祖國的中心
We are gathered here at the very center of our great nation

77
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,320
來慶祝這個歷史性的女性集會
to celebrate this historic Women's Conference.

78
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,830
這一刻對于美國人民影響深遠

79
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,520
但這也是危險的時刻  朋友們
But it's also a perilous time in our history, my friends.

80
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,870
因為一些國內的寡頭們
Because the American oligarchs out there,

81
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,010
正對我們虎視眈眈
they are coming for us.

82
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,240
他們正試圖剝奪憲法賦予我的
They are trying to strip me of my constitutional power

83
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,920
身為三軍統帥的權力
as your Commander In Chief.

84
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,020
下級法院作出了對我有利的判決
Now the lower court ruled in my favor,

85
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,360
但他們正要把此案
but now they've taken this case

86
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,700
上訴至最高法院
all the way to the Supreme Court.

87
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,470
他們要把我的手指從核按鈕上挪開
And they want my finger off the nuclear button.

88
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,850
我想問問
And I have to ask...

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,180
你覺得他們為什么要這樣
Why do you think that is?

90
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,770
這些寡頭
These oligarchs,

91
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,100
通過一個看似無害的應用
through an innocent seeming app,

92
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,950
正試圖通過偷窺你的手機
have been trying to steal the midterms

93
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,050
侵犯你的隱私
by crawling your phones,

94
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,550
指揮你如何投票
invading your privacy

95
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,650
來竊取中期選舉的勝利
and telling you how to vote.

96
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,730
那么  你會讓他們為所欲為嗎
Now, are you gonna let them get away with it?

97
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,160
不
No!

98
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,510
我們得讓他們清醒過來
We need to tell them to wake up!

99
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,670
跟著我一起說  堪薩斯州黎巴嫩的民眾
Say it with me, Lebanon, Kansas.

100
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,690
國會應該
It is time for Congress to...

101
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,170
醒醒了
Wake up!

102
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,780
最高法院應該
And it's time for the Supreme Court to...

103
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,210
醒醒了
Wake up!

104
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,260
我的目標是讓美國更上一層樓
Now, my purpose is to elevate America,

105
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,010
為她奮斗
fight for America,

106
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,920
如果有必要的話  為她犧牲
and if it ever came to it, die for America.

107
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,870
我會成為大家的父親  母親  領袖以及朋友
I will be father, mother, leader and friend.

108
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,060
非常感謝
Thank you so much.

109
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,340
父親  母親  領袖
Father, mother, leader...

110
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,150
騙子  殺手
liar, killer.

111
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,320
安息吧  瑞秋
Rest in peace, Rachel.

112
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,010
這是什么時候的錄像
When's the footage from?

113
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,550
幾天前的
It's from several days ago.

114
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,280
他一直待在一個小屋里
He's been staying at a cabin.

115
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,490
他小時候住過的地方  待了三四周
Childhood cabin for three or four weeks.

116
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,450
我們懷疑他潛藏在洛賽瑞歐斯外的山里
We suspect he's in the mountains outside Los Cerillos now.

117
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,170
他找到埋她尸體的地方了嗎
And did he find where he buried her?

118
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,020
我們還不確定
We're still not sure.

119
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,950
女士  我收到一名前探員的爆料
Ma'am, I got a tip from a former agent.

120
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,250
他曾受謝潑德兄妹指使去加夫尼打探
One of the ones poking around Gaffney on behalf of the Shepherds.

121
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,060
道格最近聯系了賽斯·格雷森
Doug recently reached out to Seth Grayson.

122
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,360
我們知道他們談了什么嗎
Do we know what was discussed?

123
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,660
不  但這是你上次和他談話后
No, but it's the first time he's contacted

124
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,770
他第一次與謝潑德家族
anyone connected with the Shepherds

125
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,640
有關的人聯絡
since you last spoke to him.

126
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,290
如果他這么想被抓的話  那就抓住他
Well, if he's trying to get caught, let's catch him.

127
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,710
鄧肯·謝潑德到底會不會去作證
So is Duncan Shepherd testifying or not?

128
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,800
他的律師還在談條件
His lawyers are negotiating the terms.

129
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,120
他們希望他能不公開作證
They're hoping that he could meet behind closed doors.

130
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,380
那他必須得被傳喚
Well, then he needs to be subpoenaed.

131
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,790
我們會見過的每個議員
Every congressperson we've spoken to

132
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,090
-都同意如此  但是  -他們在拖延
- agrees he should be and yet-- - They're delaying.

133
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,310
他們并不真想
I mean, there's no real desire

134
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,180
推動針對應用的調查
to move this app investigation along.

135
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,460
他們想保護自己人
They're protecting their own.

136
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,470
是眾議院要求舉行聽證會的
The House asked for these hearings.

137
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,260
他們需要走過場
The theatre is good for them.

138
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,210
但我們在跟委員會的
But we are in constant contact

139
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,200
民主黨成員密切聯系  女士
with the Democratic members of the committee, ma'am.

140
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,330
給他們壓力
They're feeling the pressure.

141
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,530
顯然壓力還不夠
Well, clearly, not enough.

142
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,420
我們可以先逮捕幾個議員
We can start arresting congresspeople.

143
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,340
有必要的話  把他們從眾議院拉出來
Pull them out of the chambers if we have to.

144
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,120
-舉行聽證會的意義  -是什么  打太極嗎
- The whole point of the hearings-- - Is what? Obfuscation?

145
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,130
怎么  這可是侵犯隱私的事
What? We're talking about invasion of privacy here.

146
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,000
聯邦檢察官要證據確鑿才肯
The US Attorney is resistant to pressing any kind of charges

147
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,900
-提出訴訟  -應用本身就是確鑿證據
- without hard evidence. - The app is the evidence.

148
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,220
-這就是起訴理由  諾拉  -也許吧
- This is grounds for prosecution, Nora. - Yes, maybe.

149
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,560
但聯邦檢察官不會同意
But the US Attorney would argue--

150
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,350
那就換掉聯邦檢察官
Replace the US Attorney.

151
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,590
這件事她拖了好幾個月了
She's been dragging her feet on this for months.

152
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,190
女士  我們還得走正當程序
Ma'am, we still live in a world of due process.

153
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,330
這會發出令人不安的信號
That would send a chilling message--

154
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,110
我們需要發出保護民主的信號
The message is we need to protect our democracy.

155
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,110
出于實際考慮  我們要取消今天的第四站行程
On a practical note, we're canceling the fourth stop today.

156
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,220
我們斟酌后覺得去了克利夫蘭就不用去托萊多了
Upon reflection, we decided Toledo would be redundant with Cleveland.

157
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,310
帕姆  沒事  不妨直說
Pam, it's fine. You can be honest.

158
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,420
三軍統帥
The Commander In Chief

159
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,220
今天有些迷糊而已
is feeling a little woozy today. That's all.

160
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,860
而且還有點暴躁  但沒什么的  真的
And yes, maybe a little cranky, but nothing serious. I promise.

161
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,880
我們一到得梅因
When we touch down in Des Moines,

162
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,690
諾拉  你就可以直接回華府了
Nora, you can head straight back to DC.

163
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,700
斯克斯基  你是斯拉夫人嗎
Is it Slavic, "Skorsky"?

164
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,360
我是波蘭裔
Polish, in my case.

165
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,400
你很孤獨吧
You must be lonely.

166
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,360
我讓記者團乘第二架飛機
I asked the press corps to take the second plane,

167
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,350
我們就好私下見面
so that you and I could meet privately.

168
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,120
四個月前  你見了兩個人
Four months ago, you met with two people.

169
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,710
現在一個人失蹤了  一個人死了
One of them's missing and one of them is dead.

170
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,600
我最近總是遇到不幸
My life has certainly been punctuated with loss lately.

171
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,420
但也有運氣
And just a bit of great luck.

172
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,330
但湯姆·漢默施密特就不走運了
Tom Hammerschmidt was not lucky.

173
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,270
沒錯  確實很悲慘
No, he wasn't. That was tragic.

174
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:56,030
所以我覺得你該繼承他的衣缽
That's why I think you should pick up his mantle.

175
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,760
完整地講述弗蘭西斯的政治生涯
And tell the full story of Francis' political career.

176
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,610
你在逗我嗎
Are you messing with me?

177
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,830
不  我說真的
No. Far from it.

178
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,850
你調查并曝光了謝潑德自由基金會
You did a great job investigating and exposing

179
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,180
應用的事  這非常出色
the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app.

180
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,680
曝光其非法用途
Its nefarious uses.

181
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,940
我們不能讓議員逍遙法外
We can't let congresspeople get away with things like that.

182
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,380
我懷疑最高法院廢了你之前
I wonder if you'll get them in line

183
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,100
你能不能控制住他們
before the Supreme Court takes your power away.

184
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,860
我和湯姆·漢默施密特最后一次談話時
Tom Hammerschmidt and I, the last time we spoke,

185
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,420
談到了我丈夫
we talked about my husband.

186
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,320
我希望可以跟你說完
And my hope is I could pick it up with you.

187
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,320
我有很多關于弗蘭西斯的事要說
I have a lot that needs to be said about Francis,

188
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,110
他大大小小的罪過
his crimes and misdemeanors.

189
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,540
你想不想聽我說
You want my story or don't you?

190
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
又是輕微宮縮
Oh, it's these mini contractions.

191
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,910
這叫希克斯假陣縮
They're, um... called Braxton Hicks.

192
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,430
你有孩子嗎
Do you have kids?

193
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,310
沒有
No, I don't.

194
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,150
這胎兒動靜真大
Oh, the baby's really moving now.

195
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,850
寶寶在踢  你想摸摸看嗎
It's kicking. Do you want to feel?

196
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,610
不用了  謝謝
No, thank you.

197
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,200
這感覺真奇妙
Such a strange feeling.

198
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,650
要對另一個生命負責
To be wholly responsible for the life of another.

199
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,220
我還聽說  等你有了孩子
Also, I hear, when you have kids, you never...

200
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,080
就沒法像以前一樣睡覺了
sleep quite the same again.

201
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,180
痛苦分兩種
There are two kinds of pain.

202
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,070
道格·斯坦普給我發了條信息
Doug Stamper sent me that text,

203
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,950
他說這是你丈夫日記里的話
he said it comes from your husband's diary.

204
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,070
我要問你
Now, I ask you,

205
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,260
我該采訪你  還是他
who should I interview, you or him?

206
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,110
我知道你們有些人過來
I know that some of you are here

207
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,080
是因為不確定
because you're not sure 

208
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,550
明年的聚會我是否還會健在
I'm gonna be around at next year's gathering.

209
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,580
沒事  我從你們的表情里
Oh, no, no, I can see it on--

210
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,030
看得出  沒錯
On your faces. And it's true.

211
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,900
過去幾個月  我反思了一下
These last few months, I've had to look back.

212
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,530
但我很興奮  真的
But I'm excited. I am.

213
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,440
正如我妹妹所言
As my sister told you,

214
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,850
這個國家接下來幾個月會迎來改變
there are changes coming to this country in the next few months.

215
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,300
我為之努力了20多年
The kind that I haven't been able to accomplish

216
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,100
依然沒有實現
in the 20 plus years that I've been at it.

217
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,730
為人們去監管  給每個人一個機會
It'll cut regulation for the people, give every man a chance.

218
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,300
你授人以漁
You lead a man to fish, and he--

219
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,750
卻可能為此身陷囹圄  那就來吧
You want to lock me up in prison for that, then so be it, but...

220
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,540
還凍結我的資產
Seize my assets.

221
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,230
你們知道嗎
Did you read...

222
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,250
雀鳥也做夢
finches dream?

223
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,950
是啊
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,490
它們可以
They can-- They have the--

225
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,820
它們可以在入睡時為自己歌唱
They can sing to themselves when they sleep.

226
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,440
我說到哪兒了
Where was I?

227
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,310
我這邊有些議員想要退出
I have congressmen who want to break away.

228
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,290
從這件事里脫身
Separate themselves from this.

229
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,810
見風使舵嘛
Well, deflect and compliment.

230
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,260
這就是我在國會時的生存之道
That's how I survived the Hill.

231
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,050
這些聽證會會讓我們完蛋的  馬克
These hearings will blow up on us, Mark.

232
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,110
不管怎樣  我們都用過那個破應用
Now, one way or another, we all used that motherfucking app.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,030
他們確實對我們不錯
And yes, they've been good to us, but...

234
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,220
但是我們憑什么要為那小子犯的錯買單
why do we all have to pay for what the son set in motion?

235
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,900
你對鄧肯有意見
Anything you want to say about Duncan,

236
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,970
跟安奈特說去
you say it to Annette.

237
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,370
我在請求你去說
Well, I'm asking you to say it.

238
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,390
時隔這么多年  真不敢相信
I can't believe I'm looking to you

239
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,630
我又再次向你求助
for help again all these years later.

240
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,810
你曾是副總統
You were vice president.

241
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,110
我東山再起了至少三次  布雷特
I've rebuilt my career at least three times, Brett.

242
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,190
有必要的話我還能卷土重來
And I will continue to do so as long as I have to.

243
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,570
可惜簡·戴維斯沒這個機會了
Too bad Jane Davis won't have that chance.

244
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,480
"我在克萊爾和佐伊面前是不同的人"
"What I am to Claire is not what I am to Zoe."

245
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,730
你明白這句話的意思嗎
Do you know what it means?

246
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,570
他覺得你能明白嗎
Does he believe you should know what it means?

247
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,820
是的  他補充道  "這是他留給我的"
Yes. He added, "And that's what he left me..."

248
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,990
這是弗蘭西斯日記上的話
It belongs to some diary that Francis kept.

249
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,730
但不是來自他的總統文件嗎
But not part of his presidential papers?

250
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,750
不管是什么  安德伍德總統
Whatever it is, it's information that President Underwood--

251
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,170
黑爾總統都不希望它曝光
President Hale wants kept out of the light.

252
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,740
道格暗示她為了
Doug implied that she got pregnant

253
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:35,300
奪去本屬于他的東西而懷上孕
so as to keep him from what was rightfully his.

254
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,260
你接下來什么時候能跟他通話
When will you speak with him next?

255
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,230
我猜是他下次找到公用電話或是一次性手機的時候
My guess is the next time he finds a payphone or a burner.

256
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,200
我要見他
I'd like to meet with him.

257
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,380
-安奈特  -你會出名的  布雷特
- Annette. - You're going to be famous, Brett.

258
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,930
出名也分美名遠揚
Well, there's fame...

259
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,060
和臭名昭著
and then there's notoriety.

260
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,870
你幾個月前簽署的法案
The bill you had your name on all those months ago...

261
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,870
會得到最高法院的支持
will be upheld in the Supreme Court.

262
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,170
這是阿布魯佐法官的多數判決
This is Judge Abruzzo's majority ruling.

263
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,670
-你怎么...  -是我們幫他寫的
- How did you-- - We helped him write it.

264
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,080
這個判決措辭犀利
It's worded in such a way

265
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,710
她的權力將會被慢慢地
that her powers will be diminished...

266
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,040
全部瓦解掉
over time and across the board.

267
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,560
馬克告訴你我們的計劃了嗎
Mark gave you a sense of what we're thinking?

268
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,430
說了一點
A bit.

269
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,450
你只需要拖延這些聽證會
You just need to run out the clock on these hearings.

270
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,530
中期選舉之后  你就可以強勢出手了
After the midterms, you can send a powerful message.

271
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,810
這些年我們有幸
Over the years, we've been lucky enough

272
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:39,510
扶持了一批富有才華
to support an array of talented

273
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,560
與我們志同道合的政治家
and like-minded politicians.

274
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,210
我們就像第三黨一樣
We've essentially operated like a third party.

275
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,200
總有一天
And one day,

276
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:49,830
在不遠的將來  我們會正式成立黨派
in the not too distant future, we'll make it official.

277
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,040
布雷特  你將成為黨的領袖
Brett, you will be the leader of that party.

278
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,500
你會入主白宮
You'll be our man in the White House.

279
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,780
我向布雷特表達了我們
I told Brett how thankful we are

280
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,710
對于他讓鄧肯免受媒體關注的謝意
for keeping Duncan out of the spotlight.

281
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,730
我不會忘記你為他做的事
I won't forget all you've done for him.

282
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,290
事實上  那是個很好的問題  鮑勃
Well, that's actually a very good question, Bob.

283
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,310
我們國家在世界上排名如何
Where do we rank as a country in the world?

284
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,500
如果你非要問的話  我們排第17
You have to ask that. We're 17.

285
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,700
這就是我們  第17
That's where we are. 17th.

286
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,680
-這簡直是恥辱  -說到恥辱
- That is a disgrace-- - Speaking of disgrace,

287
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,330
我有個問題問你  先生
I have a question for you, sir.

288
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,740
你生病是因為你家族的
Did your family make you sick

289
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,470
化學工廠和有毒地區嗎
with their chemical plants and their toxic sites?

290
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,420
把她帶出去
Get her out of here.

291
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,630
你是自作自受
You made yourself sick.

292
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,960
你會害死我們所有人
And you're killing all of us.

293
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,190
-來人把這位小姐帶出去  -當然了
- Somebody take care of this young lady. - Of course

294
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,700
他要趕我出去  你正在害死我們所有人
he's going to take me out. He is. You're killing all of us.

295
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,960
"我不打算說假話  我討厭小孩
"I'm not gonna lie, I despise children.

296
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,360
我就這么說了"
There, I've said it."

297
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,080
你搞什么鬼
What the hell is wrong with you?

298
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,470
"30分鐘前  佐伊給我發了條短信
"Thirty minutes ago I received a text from Zoe.

299
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,150
毫無疑問  她想道歉"
She intends to apologize, no doubt."

300
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,430
等等  等等  這話是哪來的
Wait, wait, what's that from?

301
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,780
我不是在說嗎
That's what I'm saying.

302
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,650
道格  來我這里  我們見一面
Doug, come here. Let's meet.

303
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,340
"誰都不聽話
"Rebellion on all fronts--"

304
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,070
克萊爾  佐伊  羅素  我不能失去決心"
"Claire, Zoe, Russo. I must not lose my resolve."

305
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,880
別說了  你在哪
Hey, stop. Where are you?

306
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,440
不  不  不  那是行不通的
No, no, no. That's not how this is gonna work.

307
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,800
道格  我們能找到你
Doug, we can find you.

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
用不了多久
It won't take very long.

309
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,630
我現在就告訴你我在哪
I'll tell you where I am right now.

310
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,160
就在一個鳥不拉屎的地方
Right in the middle of nowhere.

311
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,260
我五分鐘后就會離開這里  我要受不了了
I'm five minutes from out of here and out of fucking mind.

312
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,480
她只是想和你坐下談談
She just wants to sit with you.

313
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,310
我會告訴你我想讓什么被說出來和怎么說
I'm going to tell you what I want said and how.

314
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,420
他們有律師  有錢  我沒有
They have the lawyers, the money. I don't.

315
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,840
他們按我說的做
They do what I tell them,

316
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,130
那我們就可以見面
then I know we can meet.

317
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,300
你的要求都會得到滿足的  我保證
You will get everything that you are due. I'll make sure of it.

318
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,430
你什么時候再聯系我
When will I hear from you again?

319
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,790
抱歉他們把你叫到飛機上來  拉森醫生
I'm so sorry that they called you onto the plane, Dr. Larson.

320
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,360
我現在感覺好多了
I feel fine now.

321
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,260
但是依你現在的情況
All the same, you're getting close to a time

322
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,310
對你和孩子來說  飛來飛去可不是很好
where jumping on and off a plane may not be the best idea.

323
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,100
你說你覺得很累
You said you'd been feeling run down.

324
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,770
是的  有點  但...
Yes, a little bit. But--

325
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,630
我認為我們應該回華府
I think we should get you back to DC

326
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,620
驗一下血  以防萬一
to do some blood work as a precaution.

327
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,000
好  可以
Okay, that's fine.

328
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,590
但如果沒有威脅到孩子的安全
But unless I'm putting the baby in danger,

329
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,590
我今天還得再去兩個地方
I've got two more appearances today.

330
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,180
我建議你不要這么做
I'd advise against that.

331
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,130
我不能做請病假的總統  拉森醫生
I cannot be the indisposed president, Dr. Larson.

332
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,250
我相信你沒什么問題
I'm sure you're fine,

333
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,920
但是你的化驗結果顯示你有點脫水
but your sample tells me you're a bit dehydrated.

334
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,930
至少讓我給你輸點液
At least let me get you on an IV.

335
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,900
用不了多長時間的
It won't take long.

336
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,300
能讓你的體液回到正常水平
We'll get your fluids back to normal.

337
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,140
這真的有必要嗎
Is this really necessary?

338
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,830
他是個成年人了
He's a grown man.

339
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,140
如果你更愿意讓賽斯
If you'd rather have Seth

340
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,890
把簽好的文件拿給我  那也可以
bring me the signed documents that's fine, too.

341
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,970
安妮  你得承認
Annie, you have to admit

342
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,370
-這真是太荒謬了  -那是爸會說的話
- this is the most cockamamie thing-- - That's Dad's word.

343
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,650
還有拜托別把我當成
And please don't confuse me with someone

344
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,040
愿意繼續聽你的狗屁意見的人
who's willing to listen to one more of your goddamn opinions.

345
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,470
我們都要合法收養他
Each of us will legally adopt him.

346
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,230
等我們死了  就是鄧肯...
And when we're dead and gone, it will be Duncan...

347
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,090
繼承掌管
who is the face, voice and embodiment

348
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,460
謝潑德無限責任公司
of Shepherd Unlimited.

349
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,040
我是為你這么做的
I'm doing this for you.

350
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,770
-我要遲到了  -我在簽了
- I'm late. - I'm signing.

351
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,340
你想繼續避開我嗎
Is it your plan to keep avoiding me?

352
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,060
-比爾  -天啊  我到底怎么你了
- Bill. - Lordy, what exactly is it I did to you?

353
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,030
你覺得你知道什么是對我最好的
You think you know what's best for me.

354
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,800
我不是我們的父親
I am not our father.

355
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,080
如果你早點意識到這點多好
Would have been swell if you'd realized that sooner.

356
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,460
很高興你能和你的朋友
So glad you got to spend some time

357
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,040
度過如此美好的時光  比爾
with your friends like this, Bill.

358
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,600
我沒法不去想那個女人
I can't get that woman out of my head.

359
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,390
你覺得她說的對嗎
Do you think she was right?

360
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,470
我們害了自己
Did we poison ourselves?

361
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,070
阿布佐可以被彈劾嗎  是的
Is Abruzzo impeachable? Yes.

362
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,810
參議院會定他的罪嗎
Would the Senate convict him?

363
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,580
誰知道呢
Who knows?

364
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,650
但又有什么關系呢
But what does it matter?

365
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,790
你需要讓他害怕  這個辦法可能有用
You need him scared, and this might do it.

366
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,340
他在裁定一件
He received an interest-free loan

367
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,890
涉及謝潑德某子公司的案子時
from a Shepherd-owned entity

368
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,400
從謝潑德旗下的另一家機構
for a lake house at the same time

369
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,950
獲得了用于買湖邊別墅的
that he was ruling on a case that involved

370
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,780
無息貸款
another part of that company.

371
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,360
你沒事吧
Is everything all right?

372
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,830
沒事  抱歉  我只是有點脫水
Yes. Sorry. I'm just a little bit dehydrated.

373
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,260
為什么之前沒人說起過這件事  沃爾特
Why hasn't this ever come up before, Walter?

374
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,570
阿布佐并未被全面審查過
Abruzzo was never fully-vetted.

375
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,950
你  任何人都沒全面審查過他
By you, by anybody.

376
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:45,100
從某種程度上講  他被這樣強推上位
In a way, the fact that he was railroaded through

377
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,760
恰好為你提供了機會
has proved to be your opportunity.

378
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,080
最高法院的其他人呢
And the rest of the court?

379
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,660
板上釘釘了
Locked in.

380
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,000
阿布魯佐是搖擺票
Abruzzo's the swing vote.

381
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,660
謝潑德自由基金會
We at the Shepherd Freedom Foundation,

382
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,510
自由是關鍵詞
freedom being the operative word there,

383
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,410
堅信個人主義
believe in the individual.

384
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:06,340
可以說  我們基金會的理念
I could argue that our foundation is

385
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,850
比那些所謂的進步議程
more inclusive, more forward-looking

386
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,180
更具包容性和前瞻性
than any so-called progressive agenda.

387
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,230
聽啊
Oh, listen.

388
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,780
聽聽你們的聲音  你們全被洗腦了
Listen to you. You are so programmed

389
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,510
以至聽不進我的觀點
that you can't hear my argument.

390
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,070
納森  我也想幫你
Nathan. I wish I could help you.

391
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,700
在正在進行的調查中
Withholding information from

392
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,110
隱瞞證據可是犯罪
an ongoing investigation is a crime.

393
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,140
如果你知道他的所在
If you know anything about his whereabouts,

394
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,070
我建議你向我坦白
suggest you tell me.

395
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,090
這一切都結束后你準備做什么
What are you gonna do when all this is over?

396
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,860
你好好想想
I mean, think about it.

397
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,390
再過多久你會變成
How long before you become

398
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,010
那個掌握了太多秘密的人
the one with too many secrets?

399
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,190
我們的總統讓我害怕
Our president scares me.

400
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,830
如果還有誰清楚她的勾當  那就是你了
If anyone knows what she's been up to, it's you.

401
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
你還有孩子  對吧
You have children, right?

402
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,500
結過幾次婚
How many wives?

403
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,150
別把我的家人牽扯進來
Leave them out of it.

404
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,130
你能做到嗎
Can you?

405
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,950
我父親是名警察
My father was a cop.

406
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,000
我媽媽是名寡婦
My mom's a widow.

407
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,950
世道艱難  納森
It's a hard life, Nathan.

408
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,270
在局里待了這么多年
All those years at the Bureau.

409
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,560
你投入的時間  那些經驗  這都是很寶貴的
The time you put in, all that experience, it's valuable.

410
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,170
道格在哪里
Where's Doug?

411
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,720
這些活動有個特點
The thing about these events,

412
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,780
到處都是攝像頭
there's cameras everywhere.

413
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,540
賽斯
Seth.

414
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,100
別想岔  下面我要轉向攝像頭
No, because this is where I turn to the camera.

415
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,920
說一句
And I say,

416
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,750
我不知道
I don't know.

417
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,470
我很遺憾  但是有一家俄羅斯水軍公司
I'm sad to say, but there is a Russian troll factory

418
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,430
正在詆毀你丈夫的成就
that has begun to manipulate your husband's accomplishments.

419
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,540
那太糟糕了
That's awful.

420
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,260
不  我們抓到他們了  但是
No. We caught them. But for instance,

421
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,990
他在哈佛上學的記錄  他在桑蒂諾學院的記錄
records of his years at Harvard, his years at the Sentinel,

422
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,230
都幾乎查不到了
are virtually impossible to track down.

423
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,200
而是只有針對他的誹謗
Now, instead you find fabrications about him.

424
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,130
這么說吧  他們搞得烏煙瘴氣的
They filled the air with noise, so to speak.

425
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,080
我們上次會面時  你就擔心
I know from last we spoke, you were concerned

426
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,910
會出現這樣的局面
something like this could happen.

427
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,750
是的
Well, I was.

428
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,700
有人跟我說過這樣的可能性
That someone had mentioned the possibility to me.

429
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,570
但是我沒想到會成真
But I had no idea it could be done.

430
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,060
很不幸我們已經進入了新時代
We have unfortunately entered an era

431
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,290
數碼事實很容易被歪曲
where our digital truths are vulnerable.

432
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,760
這樣的話
In that case,

433
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,000
這些網絡水軍也能夸大我丈夫的罪行吧
couldn't these trolls amplify my husband's crimes as well?

434
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,720
沒錯
Yes.

435
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,210
這些言論的影響將很難消除
And those would be very difficult stories to take back.

436
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,900
維克多  如果真是如此那就太糟糕了
Viktor, that would be terrible if that were to happen.

437
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:33,170
如今的歷史由出價最高者書寫
History belongs to the highest bidder now.

438
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,330
希望后人記住的不會只是他的罪行
Well, I hope his reputation can survive his crimes.

439
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,550
我還希望
And I hope--

440
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,010
不  現在可不行
No, no, no, no, no, no, not now.

441
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,600
克萊爾  出什么問題了
Claire, something wrong?

442
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,670
-她怎么樣了  -心跳過快
- How's she doing? - She's tachycardiac

443
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:52,620
呼吸急促  Q5級宮縮
with elevated respirations, Q5 contractions.

444
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,940
你已經懷孕26周了  總統女士
You're 26 weeks pregnant, Madam President.

445
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,070
我們需要給她打4克含鎂注射液  開始靜脈點滴
We need to give her four grams of mag. Start the drip.

446
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,430
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
Francis Underwood?

447
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,210
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
Francis Underwood.

448
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,010
弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
Francis Underwood?

449
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,380
你為什么要這么說他的名字
Why do you say his name like that?

450
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,550
你為什么要跟他訂婚
Why would you get engaged?

451
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,320
我沒訂婚
I'm not engaged.

452
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,510
-格雷琴說  -格雷琴應該少管閑事
- Gretchen said-- - Gretchen should mind her own business.

453
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,580
我還沒答應他
I haven't answered him yet.

454
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,850
跟他做愛肯定不怎么樣
The sex can't be great with him,

455
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,940
事實如此
it just can't.

456
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,560
和你做愛感覺很棒
The sex is great with you.

457
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,840
我還以為我們會日遍歐洲
I thought we were gonna fuck our way across Europe

458
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,700
中國  還有非洲什么的
and China and Africa or wherever.

459
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,160
誰說我們不會了
Who says we won't?

460
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,780
天殺的弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
Francis fucking Underwood.

461
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,250
里德  別鬧了好嗎
Reed. Would you stop?

462
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,060
拜托  他根本不是你喜歡的類型
I mean, come on. The guy's not your type.

463
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,440
那你就是
Oh, because you are?

464
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,590
你父母喜歡我
I'm your parents' type.

465
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,910
但如果他們真了解我  就不會喜歡我了
But I wouldn't be if they really knew me.

466
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,610
這就等于"是"了吧
Which I guess is another way of saying yes.

467
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,420
我就是你喜歡的類型
I am your type.

468
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,110
弗蘭西斯是動物的守護神
Francis is the patron saint of animals.

469
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,680
他總是說個沒完
He never stops talking.

470
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,970
我每次見到那家伙  他都在滔滔不絕
Every time I see that guy, his mouth is running.

471
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,640
因為他總有聽眾
Because he always has an audience

472
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,940
你永遠料不到他要說什么
and you never know what he's going to say.

473
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,870
克萊爾·黑爾
Claire Hale.

474
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,550
你想要什么
What do you want?

475
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,190
什么
What?

476
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,980
我要...
I want...

477
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,780
每扇門都大敞開
every door to be wide open

478
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,470
一直敞開
and stay that way.

479
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,910
那就給他打電話
Then call him...

480
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,860
說你跟他結束了  因為你要跟我走
and tell him it's over, because you're coming with me.

481
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,290
是嗎
I am?

482
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,830
弗蘭西斯  是我
Hi, Francis, it's me.

483
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,060
我五分鐘之后到
I'm five minutes away.

484
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,030
得有人把事情查清楚  總統女士
Someone will have to get to the bottom of it, Madam President.

485
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,040
我是說
I mean...

486
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,550
催產素能誘發分娩
Pitocin induces labor.

487
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,260
她再也別想執業了
She'll never practice again.

488
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,790
孩子會沒事的吧
Is the baby gonna be okay?

489
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,920
孩子沒事
The baby is fine.

490
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,930
你看
Here we go.

491
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,910
你想知道性別嗎
Would you like to know the sex?

492
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,410
喂
Hello.

493
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,800
臭婊子  是女孩
You fucking cunt. It's a girl.

494
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,920
我來找你了  克萊爾
I'm coming for you, Claire.

495
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,420
我不會逃跑的  納森
I'm not gonna run, Nathan.

496
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,400
北緯35度28分22秒
35 degrees, 28 minutes, 22 seconds north,

497
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,200
西經106度8分58秒
by a 106 degrees, 8 minutes, 58 seconds west.

498
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,230
你說什么呢
What are you talking about?

499
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,990
瑞秋·波斯納就埋在那里
It's where Rachel Posner is buried.

500
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,190
我問你  納森
Let me ask you something, Nathan.

501
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,150
經過這么長時間
After all this time.

502
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,470
經過這么多年  我們一起為弗蘭克做的一切
All these years together. Everything that we did for Frank.

503
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,130
盧卡斯
Stuff with Lucas,

504
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,670
麥卡倫
Macallan,

505
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,640
搞恐襲的那小子
the terrorist kid.

506
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,070
我們做的一切
Everything we ever did.

507
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,450
你真的要說  你要選她嗎
Are you seriously telling me, you're gonna choose her?

508
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,360
其實  我只關心能全身而退
Literally, all I care about is getting out of this alive.

509
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,900
上車
Get in.

510
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:40,730
怎么可能還沒找到他
How is it possible we still haven't found him?

511
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,250
上次有人看見他
Last time anybody saw him,

512
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,580
他在新墨西哥的邊境檢查站附近
he was in New Mexico near a border checkpoint.

513
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,720
你真相信他出國了
You honestly believe he's out of the country?

514
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,450
說不通  納森  逃跑不是他的作風
It just doesn't fit, Nathan. It's not like him to leave.

515
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,290
他最后一次和謝潑德兄妹聯系是什么時候
When's the last time he had contact with the Shepherds?

516
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,820
他似乎確實又向格雷森先生轉述了一些奇怪的話
I gather he did convey a few more curious quotes to Mr. Grayson.

517
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,820
但現在  他的話
But at this point, the feeling is

518
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,400
似乎更像是瘋子的胡話
they're like the ravings of a crazy person.

519
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
之后再談
We'll speak later.

520
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,130
他怎么...
How did he get--

521
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,910
不不不  寶貝
Oh, no, no, no, sweetheart.

522
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,960
你父親的苦果
I will not reap...

523
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,770
不會由我來收
what your father has sown.

524
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,350
沒事吧  總統女士
Is everything all right, Madam President?

525
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,430
沒事
Yes.

526
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,040
我在找東西
I was just looking for something.

527
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,730
女士  科爾議員來了
Ma'am, Congressman Cole's here.

528
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,530
要請他進來嗎
Shall I send him in?

529
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,410
好
Yes.

530
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,400
-總統女士  -布雷特
- Madam President. - Brett.

531
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,140
我想請你幫個忙
I wonder if you would do me a favor.

532
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,030
喬治·華盛頓的畫像
The George Washington painting.

533
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,870
可以幫我掛回壁爐上嗎
Would you mind hanging that back up over the mantle?

534
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,190
當然
No.

535
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,150
非常感謝  也謝謝你能來
Thank you so much and thank you for coming.

536
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,360
請坐
Please have a seat.

537
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,890
謝潑德兄妹是從什么時候開始支持你的
Now, the Shepherds started backing you when?

538
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,840
是在你和那個可憐女子的出軌悲劇
Was that during or after your tragic affair

539
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,540
發生時  還是之后
with the poor young woman?

540
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,400
我妻子知道我出軌
My wife knows about the affair.

541
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,400
-我沒法預知...  -別慌
- There was no way I could have predicted-- - Don't worry.

542
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,780
我沒打算利用那個污點對付你
I wasn't planning on using that nasty little piece of business.

543
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,010
我只想估計一下還要多久
I just wanted to gauge how long this was going to take.

544
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,850
先不談參議院
So, putting the Senate aside,

545
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,790
眾議院有多少人在用那個應用
how many members of the House were using that app?

546
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,720
說個近似數就行
Ballpark figure is fine.

547
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,570
司法聽證會就正在調查人數
That's what our judiciary hearings are trying to determine.

548
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,950
如有必要  我會直接逮捕
I'll go straight to arrests if I have to.

549
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,310
這是叛國  布雷特
This is treason, Brett.

550
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,380
會有人因此垮臺的
Somebody will go down for it.

551
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,830
那真正的問題就是  你會嗎
So, I guess the real question is will you?

552
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,380
因為我知道  這房間里  你努力想坐的椅子
Because I know the chair in this room that you're gunning for

553
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,800
并不是你的屁股現在坐的那把
is not the one your ass is currently warming.

554
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,120
原諒我的用語
Forgive me.

555
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,840
懷孕讓我變得粗俗了
I think pregnancy has brought out the sailor in me.

556
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,670
那么
So.

557
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,890
等這次會面結束
What you're going to say to the press

558
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,670
你要和媒體怎么說
as soon as this meeting is over.

559
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,460
你要說  你要求見我
You're going to say that you asked to meet with me

560
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,140
是為了匯報你最近注意到的一些
so that you could report some good old-fashioned quid pro quo

561
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,540
屢見不鮮的等價交易
that came to your attention.

562
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:31,800
我最近任命的最高法院法官
That my recent Supreme Court appointee

563
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,830
曾為了湖邊別墅而做出了偏私的裁決
was found trading a favorable ruling for a lake house.

564
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:38,530
令人震驚
Shocking.

565
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,780
你我都清楚
And that you and I both knew

566
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,980
那樣的話  你只能
that the only choice you then had

567
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,870
去國會  啟動...
was to go to congress and initiate--

568
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:47,340
從未有最高法院法官被彈劾過
No Supreme Court justice has ever been impeached.

569
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,560
那這位阿布佐法官
The good Justice Abruzzo

570
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,740
肯定不想成為第一個  對吧
wouldn't want to be the first then, would he?

571
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,650
阿布佐法官
Justice Abruzzo...

572
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,880
是黑人
is black.

573
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,330
那就讓這件事更...
Which makes this all the more--

574
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,930
又說到這個詞了  悲劇
There's that word again, tragic.

575
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,590
總統女士
Madam President.

576
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,400
你先別跟我說  我們不該見面
Before you explain to me how we shouldn't be meeting

577
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,580
或者布雷特不該在這里
or how Brett shouldn't be here,

578
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,690
三權分立等等
separation of branches and all that.

579
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,040
我們正在審理的案子
We are considering a case

580
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,550
能直接影響到總統職位
that will directly affect the office of the presidency.

581
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,030
我知道  一個以布雷特參與簽署的重要法案
I know, a case based on the monumental piece of legislation

582
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,870
為基礎的案子
co-signed by Brett.

583
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,640
但我們三個今天碰面
But the three of us standing here right now

584
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,190
跟那無關
have nothing to do with that.

585
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,990
對不對  議員
Isn't that right, Congressman?

586
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,080
對  總統女士
Yes, Madam President.

587
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,140
我會讓議長解釋的
I'll let the speaker explain.

588
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,480
因為有幾項選擇供你考慮
'Cause you have a number of options to consider.

589
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:53,010
我想讓你知道這件事讓我多尷尬
And I want you to know how truly embarrassing it is for me.

590
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,200
我為最高法院選的人竟要面對如此悲哀的命運
The sad fate of my choice for the court.

591
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,650
另外  我愛尚普蘭湖
And by the way, I love Lake Champlain.

592
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,810
我只去過兩次
I've only been there twice,

593
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,030
但我永遠忘不了湖水濺在腳上的冰冷
but I'll never forget the thrilling shock

594
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,000
是多刻骨銘心
of the cold water on my feet.

595
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,330
我孫子得了多發性硬化癥  他必須游泳
My grandson has MS. He needs to swim.

596
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,390
我不妄作評論  阿布佐法官
I don't judge, Justice Abruzzo.

597
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,720
不對  除了對謊話
I'll correct that. Except for mendacity.

598
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,680
我沒法支持謊話
That I can't support.

599
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,890
還有  布雷特  你跟謝潑德兄妹匯報時
And, Brett, when you report this back to the Shepherds,

600
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,700
替我代好
give them my best.

601
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,200
作為謝潑德家族的一員  你知道自己有責任
As a Shepherd, you know it's your duty to

602
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,010
回報藝術事業  回報你所在的社區
give back to the arts and the communities you're involved in.

603
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:47,810
我們在加德納分析做的一切
You know, everything we've ever done at Gardner Analytics

604
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,050
都是為了服務用戶
is to serve the user.

605
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,920
你已經說的很清楚了  沒錯
You've made that clear, yes.

606
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,750
但你知道用戶授權給了你們
And yet, you were aware of the amount of data

607
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,050
多少數據
the user was essentially signing over to you.

608
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,880
并不比其他應用多
No more than any other application.

609
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,830
但白宮聲稱
But the White House is saying

610
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,460
謝潑德自由基金會應用
that the Shepherd Freedom Foundation app

611
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,310
比其他應用更過分
went beyond any other application.

612
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,800
它讓國會競選團隊
That it allowed congressional campaigns

613
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,990
獲得用戶手機的全部權限
complete access to the user's phone.

614
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,010
有人甚至說
Some are even saying that

615
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,500
這款應用能操控人的精神
the app is essentially mining peoples' psyches.

616
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:11,280
是這樣
Look.

617
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,250
我們設計了應用
You design the thing, but at the end of the day,

618
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,440
但無從知道人們會怎么使用它
you have no idea how it will be used.

619
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,190
謝潑德先生
Mr. Shepherd.

620
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,500
我能失陪一下嗎
Could you excuse me for one moment, please?

621
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,140
我是聯調局的斯雷特探員
I'm Agent Slater with the FBI.

622
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,310
有什么事嗎
What's this about?

623
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,160
請跟我們來一趟
Please come with us.

624
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,050
在通知律師之前我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere until I call my lawyer.

625
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:32,600
謝潑德先生  請吧
Mr. Shepherd, please.

626
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,640
你最好配合一點
It'd be best if you cooperated.

627
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,210
阿布魯佐正申請回避
Abruzzo is recusing himself.

628
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,740
為什么
On what grounds?

629
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,800
利益沖突
His conflict of interest.

630
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,440
這可事關總統之位的未來
This is about the future of the presidency.

631
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,340
他用自己在部隊服役的事當借口
He's using his military service.

632
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,880
把他叫過來
Get him over here.

633
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,340
太遲了  他不能撤回申請了
It's too late, he can't reverse himself.

634
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,610
遲不遲由我來定
I decide when it's too late.

635
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,800
我不會讓這個裁決通過的
I will not have that ruling upheld.

636
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,560
我們還能去找誰
Who else can we get to?

637
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,560
巴里
Barry.

638
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,140
安奈特  別開電視
Annette, do not turn on the TV.

639
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,050
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

640
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,910
他們把他帶走了  他們帶著逮捕證闖了進來
They took him. They came in with a warrant.

641
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,240
你說他被帶走了是什么意思
What do you mean they took him?

642
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,700
他們以應用為由
They're using his work with the app

643
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,510
控訴他犯有叛國罪
as grounds to charge him with treason.

644
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,020
我向你保證  我們會極盡所能去救他
I promise you, we will do everything we can.

645
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,450
但所有與這款應用有牽連的人
But anyone connected with the app

646
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,510
都在和它  還有你撇清關系
is distancing themselves from it and you.

647
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,040
這一刻終于來了
It's finally here.

648
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,180
稿子都是誰改的
Where did these changes come from?

649
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,960
謝潑德家族直接改的
Directly from the Shepherd family.

650
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,660
是他媽媽嗎
His mother?

651
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,480
只管做好你的工作  開始錄像吧
Look, just do your thing. Let's get it on tape.

652
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,880
納粹一般的策略
Nazi-like tactics?

653
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,420
除非話題有關二戰
You bring up Nazis in any situation

654
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,010
不然你一提起納粹
other than the Second World War,

655
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,680
就已經輸掉辯論了
you've already lost the argument.

656
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,440
得了吧  我們都知道鄧肯干了什么
I mean, come on, we all knew what Duncan was doing.

657
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,260
還有誰沒料到嗎
Is anybody really surprised?

658
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,790
-認真的嗎  -梅樂蒂
- I mean, really? - Melody...

659
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:19,940
怎么了
What?

660
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,430
-你這是  -不干了
- What are you-- - No.

661
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,380
民調顯示她的支持率達75%以上
She's polling in the high 70s.

662
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,370
到中期選舉時可能達到近80%
We're looking at close to 80 by the midterms.

663
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,340
反企業浪潮
The anti-corporate rant

664
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,640
也在愈演愈烈
is gaining traction.

665
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,830
她在拿女權主義當武器
She's weaponized her feminism,

666
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,060
這讓人越來越厭煩
and it's grown tiresome.

667
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,730
"我是個母親  也是個將軍"
"I'm a mother, I'm a general."

668
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,370
拉倒吧
Spare me.

669
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,450
像她這么受歡迎的人對民主是有害的
Anyone that popular is bad for democracy.

670
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,850
馬克
Mark.

671
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,850
先說有利之處
So, the pros.

672
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,140
她死后  副總統的位子空缺
After her death, with the vice presidency vacant,

673
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,500
我們的朋友布雷特·柯爾會成為總統
our friend Brett Cole will be president.

674
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,020
我們猜想到時人們會呼吁安定和團結
We suspect we'll get a call for stability and unity.

675
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,610
治愈這個國家  套路大家都清楚
Heal the nation, we all know the drill.

676
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,900
不利之處是  我們會在中期選舉受到打擊
The cons. We're gonna take a hit in the midterms.

677
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,930
我覺得眾議院還能保住
I think we hold on to the House.

678
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,770
參議院就難說了
The Senate is a long shot.

679
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,700
市場會波動一段時間
The markets will fluctuate for a while.

680
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,700
為此我叫了洛琳來
I've brought Lorraine in for that.

681
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,770
她做了一些很不錯的
She's got some impressive

682
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,090
計算機模型和預測
computer models and projections. But...

683
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,070
總而言之  我們有信心承受
all in all, we're confident we can absorb

684
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,510
刺殺所能引發的
whatever financial hit

685
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,770
經濟波動所導致的金融損失
an assassination would have on the economy.

686
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,220
GDP總值可能最多會損失
We're talking about a quarter point loss

687
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,340
四分之一個百分點
in the GDP, at the most.

688
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,800
那可能引發的陰謀論呢
And what about all the conspiracy nonsense we'll be hearing?

689
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,760
這些論調可以分散人們的注意力
The theories are a useful distraction.

690
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,360
最終都會不了了之
And eventually, they consume themselves.

691
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,060
這在歷史上有先例可循
History will back us up on that.

692
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,000
還有個重大的障礙
There's one hiccup. It's a big one.

693
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,210
她懷了孩子
She's with child.

694
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:53,320
這是一個我們不知道如何
That is a variable we don't know

695
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,890
在我們的模型中計算或預測的變量
how to account for in our models or predict.

696
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,970
我們要利用它
We use it. Play into it.

697
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,010
我們要讓她成為烈士
We'll make her a martyr.

698
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:03,390
時代的犧牲品
A victim of the times.

699
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,340
女權主義的偶像
A feminist icon.

700
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,870
天哪  她甚至可能被印到硬幣上
God, she might even end up on a coin.

701
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,280
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}意外拍攝到肯尼迪被刺殺場景的路人

702
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,280
只要不再出現一個澤普魯德
As long as another Zapruder doesn't show up.

703
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,760
杰克  這不好笑
Jack, that's not funny.

704
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,060
我想知道的就這么多
Well, that's as much as I want to know.

705
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:22,590
是的  我想你們最好現在就走吧
Yes, I think it's best if you all leave now.

706
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,210
接下來交給我
I'll take it from here.

707
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,070
把他帶進來
Bring him in.

708
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,640
到最后關頭了
It's 11 o'clock, as they say.

709
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,900
你想要我手里的東西
You want what I have.

710
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,600
事實上  我希望你繼續拿著
Actually, I want you to hold on to it.

711
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:39,330
我告訴過賽斯  我再告訴你一次
I told Seth, and I'll tell you again.

712
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,430
我想把她搞垮  而不是弗蘭西斯
I want to bring her down, but not Francis.

713
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,890
難道你不知道那是不可能的嗎
Don't you know that's impossible?

714
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,070
即使殺她丈夫的人就是她
Even if she killed her husband?

715
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,400
道格...
Doug...

716
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,320
我們兩個的目標是一致的
my goal and yours have become the same.

717
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,290
她叫你道格嗎
Does she call you Doug?

718
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,810
還是像她叫弗蘭西斯一樣
Or does she do that Francis thing of hers.

719
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,410
道格拉斯
Douglas.

720
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,000
你知道我們需要做什么
You know what we need to do.

721
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,450
你總是把我想錯
You keep mistaking me for someone I'm not.

722
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
我不在乎你  也不在乎你想要什么
I don't care about you or what you want.

723
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,400
但你確實在乎弗蘭克想要什么
But you do care what Frank wanted.

724
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,830
現在你該承認了
And it's time you admitted it.

725
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,980
弗蘭克想讓她死
Frank wanted her dead.

726
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,550
這對你來說似乎更像是私人恩怨
This seems too personal for you.

727
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,840
所有政治都是私人恩怨
All politics is personal.

728
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,800
你是最該知道這一點的人
You of all people know that.

729
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,610
你也希望她死
And you want her dead, too.

730
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,130
我們兩個人都不能單獨做成這件事
And neither one of us can do it alone.

731
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,970
你很快就會想明白的
You'll come to your senses soon.

732
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:48,460
你不是傻瓜
You're no fool.

733
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,810
你想保護他留給你的東西嗎
You want to protect what he left you?

734
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,570
這是唯一的辦法
It's the only way.

735
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,520
我要為法院即將做出的判決祝賀你
Congratulations on the ruling coming out of the court.

736
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,200
他們還沒有決定
They still haven't decided.

737
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,010
但我們都知道結果會如何
But we all know how it's going to go.

738
00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:18,310
請坐
Please, sit down.

739
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,340
諾拉·卡弗蒂...
Nora Cafferty...

740
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:25,670
有一個秘密
has a secret.

741
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,190
您說什么
Excuse me.

742
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,150
我以為你是在擔心胎兒的事
I assume you were worried about the scare with the baby.

743
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,010
我跟佩特羅夫總統談過
I spoke to President Petrov.

744
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:35,990
他告訴我
He's informed me that

745
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:39,870
哈里發國正在試圖獲取核設備
ICO is trying to acquire a nuclear device.

746
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,090
對  確實
Yes. They are.

747
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:44,880
那你為什么沒告訴我
So why didn't you tell me?

748
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,710
我完全信任你  諾拉
I have full confidence in you, Nora,

749
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:52,020
也信任你的能力  但這讓我擔心
and your abilities, but this concerns me.

750
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,380
你在任何情況下都不能
You cannot under any circumstances

751
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,040
隱瞞對我們國家安全至關重要的信息
withhold information that is essential to our national security.

752
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,260
我曾對你有很高的期待
I had such high hopes for you.

753
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,140
你說什么
I'm sorry.

754
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,840
我本不想把這話說出來
I didn't want to have to say this.

755
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:15,970
我本希望最高法院的判決對你不利
I was hoping the Supreme Court would rule against you.

756
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,070
希望他們剝奪你控制核武的權利
That they would take away the football.

757
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,430
我不是唯一一個開始有這種感覺的人
And I'm not the only one who's starting to feel it.

758
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,460
這是我的地盤  我要你出去
This is my house, and I want you out.

759
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,580
她準備要譴責她丈夫了
She's ready to condemn her husband.

760
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:53,660
那你為什么不那樣做呢
So why aren't you?

761
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,510
殺死湯姆的不是小偷
It wasn't a thief who killed Tom.

762
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,100
不是
No.

763
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,140
我覺得不是
I don't think it was.

764
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,350
聽著  我和湯姆當時在...
Look, Tom and I were working on--

765
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,490
得了  我知道他在干什么
Okay, I know what he was working on.

766
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:21,080
我花了將近一個月才找到
It took me almost a month to find it,

767
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,830
但那東西在狗的項圈上
but it was on his dog's collar.

768
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:23,900
他做的事情跟
It was the same thing

769
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,580
盧卡斯和之前佐伊做的事一樣
Lucas was working on and Zoe before that.

770
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,140
總是遇到同樣的問題
Always with the same problem,

771
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,190
沒有人肯相信
no one will believe it.

772
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:34,350
-我都跟他說了  -沒有任何證據
- Look, I laid it out for him-- - Without any evidence.

773
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,530
難道你有證據嗎
Or do you have any?

774
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:45,730
全都是你的說辭
All there is, is your word.

775
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:47,950
現在那還有什么價值
And what is that even worth these days?

776
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:53,150
你到底在保護什么
I mean, what the hell are you protecting?

777
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,330
我可以繼續開  沒關系的
I can keep driving. I don't mind.

778
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:09,990
或者你可以幫我完成湯姆  盧卡斯
Or you can help me finish the story of Tom, Lucas,

779
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:12,240
佐伊  你  還有...
Zoe, you and...

780
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,130
也許還有我的報道
maybe me.

781
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,620
我試探了你
I tested you.

782
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,140
你通過了
And you passed.

783
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:29,640
我就是這么看的  總統女士
That's basically how I see it, Madam President.

784
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,150
你好無禮
You're impertinent.

785
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,830
從一開始就特別明顯
That was clear from the start.

786
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,310
不  我有野心
No, I'm ambitious.

787
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,990
我一直都很敬佩你的野心
Which is something that I've always admired,

788
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,490
哪怕我在遠處
from afar, about you.

789
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,970
你攻擊我也是出于敬佩嗎
Even when you were attacking me?

790
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:45,380
原諒我  我緊張的時候會咄咄逼人
Forgive me. I become aggressive when I'm nervous.

791
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,370
老毛病了
It's always been that way.

792
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,700
我們可以重新來過嗎
Can we start over?

793
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,190
因為我好像終于理解了你
Because I think I finally understand you

794
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,060
理解了你想為這個國家做的
and what you're trying to do for this country.

795
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,200
我可以當你的傳聲筒
I can help you get your message out.

796
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,300
好啊
Sure.

797
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:01,850
-好了  準備好  各位  -開始吧
- All right, settle, people. - Okay, let's begin.

798
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,150
四  三  二...
Let's go in four, three, two--

799
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:07,560
首先
First things first.

800
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,380
不管賭局猜是哪種性別
Despite what the odds-makers have decided,

801
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,980
是個女孩  我就要當媽媽了
I am going to be the mother of a baby girl.

802
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:16,590
-恭喜  -謝謝
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

803
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,140
你想好給她取什么名字了嗎
And have you picked out a name?

804
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,750
還沒有
Um, not yet.

805
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,610
我得先見到她的小臉
I need to see her face first.

806
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:30,100
你最希望美國人民了解你的哪一點
What do you most wish the American people knew about you?

807
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,580
出人意料的一面
Something surprising.

808
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:37,190
我最喜歡大笑了
That I like nothing more than to laugh.

809
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,790
即將成為母親
And what does the prospect of becoming a mother,

810
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,960
同時又是自由世界的領導  是什么感覺
while being the leader of the free world, feel like?

811
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,610
苦中帶甜
Bittersweet.

812
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:51,110
我當然沒想過會以遺孀的身份生下弗蘭西斯的孩子
I didn't expect to deliver Francis' child as a widow, of course.

813
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:56,230
但我有責任要盡  為了我尚未出世的孩子
But I have things to do for my unborn child,

814
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,650
為了這個不成熟的國家
for this unformed nation.

815
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,690
我想創造出進步而高效的黑爾政治遺產
I want to create a progressive and productive Hale legacy

816
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,820
并影響后世
for the ages.

817
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,290
說到這點
Speaking of which.

818
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:08,760
你為什么重新用娘家姓了
Why did you return to your maiden name?

819
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,720
答案就在你的問題里
Well, I think your question answered itself.

820
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,620
娘家姓[少女名]
Maiden name.

821
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,000
這種稱呼的背后含義
The assumptions behind that expression

822
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,200
讓我回歸了我的本名
led me back to what I can only call my name.

823
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,880
黑爾總統
President Hale,

824
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,980
為什么副總統空缺
why the delay in nominating a replacement

825
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,120
遲遲不做提名
for the vice presidential vacancy?

826
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,950
有兩個原因  其一  是因為憲法
Two reasons. One, constitutionally,

827
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,070
要求國會確認人選
Congress needs to confirm the choice

828
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:37,030
但現在  國會烏煙瘴氣
and our current Congress is dirty.

829
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,530
我們得看中期選舉的結果
We'll have to see what happens with the midterms.

830
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:45,410
其二  要說我從搭檔關系中學到了什么
And two, if I've learned anything from partnerships,

831
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,830
你必須選一個甘愿為你擋子彈的人
you have to choose someone who'd take a bullet for you.

832
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,470
還有  梅樂蒂  有件事我想澄清一下
And, Melody, I'd like to come clean on something.

833
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:54,520
請講
Please.

834
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,730
真相是  雖然說出真相讓我很痛苦
The truth is, and it pains me to say this,

835
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,590
但真相是  這個國家
but the truth is, this country

836
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:03,850
從未有機會了解真正的弗蘭西斯·安德伍德
never got to know the real Francis Underwood.

837
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,720
連我自己都未必真了解他
I'm not sure I ever really knew him myself.

838
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,880
我知道你也看出來了
I know you saw it, too.

839
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,770
他無法被看透  就跟其他騙子一樣
He was impossible to know, like all con men.

840
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,430
他把我們都耍了
He played us all.

841
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,910
來找我啊  道格
Come and get me, Doug.

842
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,680
她讓我別無選擇
She leaves me no choice.

00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:33,900
*劃呀劃  劃小船*
*Row, row, row your boat*

*Life is but a dream*

847
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:51,630
*劃呀劃  劃小船  順溪流  緩緩流*
*Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream*

848
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,160
*瞧見鱷魚*
*If you see a crocodile*

849

*記得叫喊*
*Don't forget to scream*

{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}"核武橄欖球"可追溯到冷戰時期  在核戰爭一觸即發的形勢下
美國總統出行時開始攜帶可以下令發動核武攻擊的"核按鈕"
但其實  "橄欖球"是一個標準的Zero Halliburton牌鋁制保險箱
外套一個黑皮公文包
箱內主要物品是總統考慮發動核打擊時的打擊方案  啟動警報的程序
以及最重要的  一個印有密碼的塑料卡片  用來驗證總統身份
這個卡片被叫做"餅干"
利用包內的物品  美國總統可以同五角大樓的指揮中心聯系
在驗證身份后  下令實施核打擊
總統出行時  "橄欖球"由一名經過最嚴格背景調查的武官攜帶保管
這名武官被要求必須時刻緊跟總統左右  但也會有意外情況發生
里根總統遇刺后  被專車迅速送往醫院進行緊急手術
而攜帶"橄欖球"的武官卻沒有立刻隨車前往
事后人們還發現  里根當時把帶有驗證碼的"餅干"放在了自己的襪子里
而手術期間這個可以發動核戰爭的塑料卡片被護士丟在了醫院的地板上

00:56:01,300 --> 00:57:01,300
{\an5}{\pos(193,147)}在美國的媒體江湖中  絕大部分的主流媒體
如《紐約時報》《華盛頓郵報》《時代周刊》
NBC  CBS  ABC三大電視網  CNN  MSNBC等有線新聞臺
都在意識形態上不同程度左傾  偏向民主黨  對民主黨政客也呵護有加
只有《華爾街日報》和福克斯新聞網是共和黨的盟友
但正因為右派媒體少  所以支持共和黨的民眾都集中在這兩家媒體
再加上經營有方  福克斯新聞和《華爾街日報》都在同行競爭中占優勢
而這兩家媒體的老板是同一個人  新聞集團的主席默多克
在巨大的受眾群體的支持下  這兩家媒體在政治輿論戰中舉足輕重
默多克家族在美國政壇自然也影響巨大  呼風喚雨
奧巴馬執政期間  福克斯新聞對民主黨政府一直苛責不斷
而特朗普上臺后  福克斯新聞則成了新政府最好的朋友
特朗普在競選期間  就經常找默多克商量競選事宜
搬入白宮后  也經常給默多克打電話咨詢政務  還常邊看福克斯新聞邊發推特
以至于全美國關心政治的媒體公眾也跟著成了福克斯新聞的觀眾
福克斯的一些主持人在默多克的默許下  成為特朗普的親密戰友
在節目中夸贊新政府的豐功偉績  攻擊起特朗普的政敵則毫不留情
