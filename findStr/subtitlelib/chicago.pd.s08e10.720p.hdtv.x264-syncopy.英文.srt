9
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,130
How we doing, Pops?

10
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,200
You know, like I got a week to figure out

11
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,040
the hell I'm gonna do with my days.

12
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,180
30 years, and my only hobby was bitching about my job.

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,160
Ah, that's the cop way.

14
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,850
- You'll figure it out. - Yeah.

15
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,660
Gentlemen.

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,470
- Bob! - Rizzy!

17
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,380
- Old man. - Hey, Bob.

18
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,910
You remember my boy, Adam.

19
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,670
With scruff on his face, I don't.

20
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,560
Hey, Duff.

21
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,680
We just wanted to stop by, see how you usually do it.

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,950
Yeah, we got these things down pretty good, I think.

23
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,480
Figure you don't need the whole place, right?

24
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,580
No, no. 15, 20 max.

25
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,100
Well, we'll get that area closed off,

26
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,260
set aside for you, put out some snacks.

27
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,410
Won't be too complicated.

28
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,300
Usually take a little deposit.

29
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,190
200 maybe?

30
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,140
- Seems fair. - Uh, yeah, yeah, hang on.

31
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,910
Hang on.

32
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,220
Dad, I got it.

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,900
Yeah?

34
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,790
You don't pay for your own retirement party.

35
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,630
Come on.

36
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,950
Bob Ruzek.

37
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,920
Finally putting you out to pasture.

38
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,810
Well, better than being taken behind the barn and shot, I guess.

39
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,070
That's right.

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,460
What does it say about the Chicago Police Department

41
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,110
that you turkeys serve up the best coffee in the building?

42
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,660
Nothing good, Sarge.

43
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,690
I saw the flyer downstairs about Disco Bob's party.

44
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,380
Yeah, this weekend. No obligation.

45
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,100
Are you nuts? I don't go to those things.

46
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,940
Years ago, when we were babies working at the 13th,

47
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,460
your dad would show up for his shift

48
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,370
reciting your stats from your game the night before.

49
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,610
"Adam went three for four last night

50
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,650
with a double and two RBIs."

51
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,260
Well, we should definitely keep doing that.

52
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,950
Adam went three for four last night

53
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,110
with a hoagie and two beers.

54
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,490
And a sacrifice pickle.

55
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,270
Heyo.

56
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,220
Something for your old man.

57
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,780
Thanks, boss. You didn't have to do that.

58
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,790
I know you had your issues with him over the years.

59
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,900
30 years of service to the city of Chicago

60
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,120
is 30 years of service-- end of story.

61
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,200
Appreciate it.

62
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,040
What are you hungry for for dinner?

63
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,220
Let's go to that place on Clybourn.

64
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,640
What do you call it? Platonic Pizza?

65
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,880
Platonic Pie.

66
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,570
Oh, 'cause that's so much snappier.

67
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,870
It's a skillset.

68
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,880
Swing by my dad's house quick.

69
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,550
All right.

70
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,780
I'll just run this inside,

71
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,310
and then we'll go pick up Makayla.

72
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,090
Okay?

73
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,690
Actually, you know what?

74
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,500
Why don't you come in, see the old man?

75
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,120
He'd be happy to see your face.

76
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,070
Come on.

77
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,960
- You sure? - Yeah, come on.

78
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,460
- Sure, sure? - Yeah.

79
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,000
Have you told him about...

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,190
All the times you broke my heart?

81
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,690
No. You're good.

82
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,530
Are you protecting me from his wrath?

83
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,820
No, I just figured if he was ever forced to make a choice,

84
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,680
he'd pick you over me.

85
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,440
I mean, that's the choice I would make.

86
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,040
Pops, I hope you're decent.

87
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
Coming in with the girl.

88
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,050
Dad?

89
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,910
Hey, Dad?

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,590
Dad?

91
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,770
Bob?

92
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,070
Adam.

93
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,440
All right. I'm gonna call him.

94
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,340
Yeah.

95
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,190
All right. It's ringing.

96
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,630
What the hell is this?

97
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,760
Dad?

99
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,610
- More blood down here. - Yeah...

100
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,560
Dad!

101
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,140
That blood is fresh, Adam.

102
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,290
You got anything?

103
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,600
Uh, sort of.

104
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,630
I spoke to a neighbor.

105
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,120
She said she saw two men pull up to the back of the house.

106
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,520
White, possibly Hispanic. They entered.

107
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,360
Then they left about 20 minutes ago.

108
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,140
It's a start. Call it in.

109
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,330
What?

110
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,580
It's just, Kim, my dad, you know,

111
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,250
he's made some pretty crappy choices over the years.

112
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,610
I don't know what happened in here,

113
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,290
but there's a decent chance it was self-inflicted.

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,130
Maybe.

115
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,960
But you gotta call it in.

116
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,010
5021I
5021 Ida.

117
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,210
Go ahead, Ida.

118
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,420
I need you to roll a crime lab

119
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,390
to 221 North Oleander.

120
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,170
Possible home invasion, possible kidnapping.

121
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,290
Copy that. Crime lab en route.

123
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,290
What up, dog? You good?

124
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:06,780
I've been better.

125
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,170
I don't know what happened there, boys,

126
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,880
but it wasn't good, whatever it was.

127
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,370
Well, you know, whatever it is, we gonna figure it out.

128
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,300
We got you.

129
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,320
Appreciate it, fellas.

130
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,290
I told you to get that van out of here.

131
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,350
Copy, Sergeant.

132
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,900
All right. Everybody, listen to me.

133
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,930
The last thing Bob Ruzek needs

134
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,410
is his face on the evening news.

135
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,950
That's how people get hurt.

136
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,930
Send patrol away.

137
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,950
We're working this as a 99 Confidential.

138
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,800
Only OCD in the loop.

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,130
But that means this is all on us.

140
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,580
All right? Where are we?

141
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,420
Okay. We got a struggle inside the house.

142
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,220
There's blood in the kitchen

143
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,520
which leads to the backdoor.

144
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,180
Pretty clear my father left in a hurry

145
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,580
and it wasn't his idea to do so.

146
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,300
I mean, his car is here. The TV was on.

147
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,300
His keys, his wallet, service revolver,

148
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,460
his phone, which I just started going through.

149
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,880
Password was his badge number

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,540
'cause who would've thought of that?

151
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,700
Okay. Anything jump out?

152
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,370
No, it's all just normal stuff.

153
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,230
I mean, here I am texting him about the retirement party.

154
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,790
What?

155
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,420
Talk to me.

156
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,260
It says,

158
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,390
Tuesday, 6:13,

159
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,360
"You don't deliver, it's over."

160
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,720
It's a restricted number.

161
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,300
All right, any idea who might send something like that

162
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,360
to your old man?

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,360
No.

164
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,930
Tech said that the footprints

165
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,800
and the blood leading to the back door

166
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,700
were made by somebody wearing socks.

167
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,550
So if this is what it seems, somebody grabbed him.

168
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,470
Didn't even give him a chance to put his shoes on.

169
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,130
All right. Keep canvassing this block.

170
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,160
Find some cameras.

171
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,710
Scrape together enough to get a BOLO out on that car.

172
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,930
- Kim. - Yeah.

173
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,070
I want a full scrub of all of Bob Ruzek's cases,

174
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,870
top to bottom.

175
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,300
Something like this happened to one of us,

176
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,800
the first thing we'd think it's related to a case somehow.

177
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,530
- Right. - Revenge,

178
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,370
- somebody seeking information-- - Boss.

179
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,030
My pop spent the last 20 years directing traffic

180
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,080
at afternoon Sox games, not kicking in doors.

181
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,500
I mean, I don't think Kim's gonna find anything there.

182
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,060
Okay, he's still a police officer.

183
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,360
That man spent a lot of time on a lot of streets.

184
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,310
Do the work.

185
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,360
Now, I'm on it.

186
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,230
- Can I help you? - Gonna see Benny.

187
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,750
Hey. You can't go back there.

189
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,180
No. Nope.

190
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,270
- Nope. - Benny.

191
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,550
Adam.

192
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,040
Benny, we need to talk.

193
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,280
Everybody, out.

194
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,470
Adam, the hell is this?

195
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,920
There's no Adam here, Benny.

196
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,420
Not tonight.

197
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,230
There's just a cop up your ass.

198
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:52,140
- Where's my father, Benny? - What?

199
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,420
I know you texted him, told him to deliver.

200
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,480
- I didn't-- - Where is he, Benny?

201
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,290
- That wasn't me; I swear. - No, no, no, where is he?

202
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,910
- I--I don't-- - Benny.

203
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,910
Hey, hey. Did you hurt my dad?

204
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,100
No, no. I did not.

205
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,500
- Did you hurt my dad? - No, I did not.

206
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,820
Listen to me.

207
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,880
Now you just take a breath.

208
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,960
I will tell you exactly what happened,

209
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,420
and you are not gonna do anything bananas.

210
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,270
Deal?

211
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,450
Tell me what happened.

212
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,470
Your pops-- I am not gonna lie--was in trouble with me.

213
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
- Bad. - How bad?

214
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,070
Like real bad.

215
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,380
Truth is, you know it. I know it.

216
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,440
He's the worst gambler I ever knew.

217
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,950
Got into a hole and just kept digging deeper

218
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,060
until I finally cut him off.

219
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,220
Benny, just tell me how much.

220
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,600
80 grand.

221
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:39,490
80 grand?

222
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,160
Benny, how could you let it get that bad this time?

223
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,720
- I mean, if you said hey, I-- - Listen to me.

224
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,410
I did not lay a finger on your father.

225
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,550
And the reason is simple.

226
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
He paid. All of it.

227
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,660
What are you talking about?

228
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,300
- In cash. - No.

229
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,540
Walked in one night, dropped it,

230
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,140
walked out, I ain't seen him since.

231
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,310
- Yeah? When's this? - About a month ago.

232
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,970
Date's in the ledger book if you need it.

233
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,420
Sorry, Benny.

234
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,350
What, are you following me?

235
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,900
Yes. Yes.

236
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,890
Look, you were clearly lying to Voight

237
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,250
when you saw that text at your dad's house.

238
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:23,760
I wanted to make sure

239
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,560
you weren't doing something extracurricular,

240
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,500
just plain ol' stupid. Were you?

241
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,850
Yeah. That'd be fair to say.

242
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:30,650
And?

243
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,550
And, well, it turns out a few weeks ago,

244
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,170
my father paid down an 80 grand debt.

245
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,460
A few hours ago, he couldn't put down

246
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,520
a $200 deposit on a bar.

247
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,990
And now he's gone.

248
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,970
Okay. Okay.

249
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,190
You know how he got the 80 grand?

250
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,470
No, I don't.

251
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,840
I thought I knew what was going on.

252
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,730
I don't.

253
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,170
Hey. We're gonna figure it out.

254
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,310
Yeah.

255
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,400
It's the same restricted number.

256
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,450
It's a video.

257
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,340
- Hello, son. - Oh, my God.

258
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,790
I'm okay. I'm all right.

259
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,900
I just, um-- I'm in a bit of trouble here.

260
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,030
These guys--Los Tiranos--

261
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,160
I don't need to tell you who they are.

262
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,700
They got a problem.

263
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,020
A snitch.

264
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,480
Someone on the inside

265
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,660
that's giving them trouble.

266
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,850
So they need you-- I need you--

267
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,360
to find out who it is.

268
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,960
And then give them the name, okay?

269
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,350
Or I'm gone for good, son. I'm gone.

270
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,710
We'll be back in touch.

271
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,930
We got a Chicago cop missing 12 hours.

272
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,380
Tell me something good.

273
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,810
We looped in OCD?

274
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,610
We got trap-and-trace on Officer's Ruzek's phone,

275
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,490
but so far, nothing.

276
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,070
Okay. What's the latest on the scrub of his police work?

277
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm into it, Sarge.

278
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,870
It's just not a lot of meat on the bone.

279
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,800
Okay, so, Sarge, this is the claim territory of Los Tiranos,

280
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,440
the Hispanic gang that's holding down Bob Ruzek.

281
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,740
So these guys are an umbrella gang,

282
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,990
- cartel-connected. - Okay.

283
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,390
They got hundreds of foot soldiers,

284
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,660
dozens of cliques, each one is a silo.

285
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,430
It's gonna take some time to put a face to this.

286
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,510
Right, so they occupy the Lower West Side,

288
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,940
the South Loop, Marshall Square,

289
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,690
but the heart of it happens right here in Pilsen.

290
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,650
So we got reason to believe

291
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,150
these guys know what they're talking about.

292
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,720
I mean, Los Tiranos was running unchecked for a long time,

293
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,820
but the last couple months,

294
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,030
they've taken some hits.

295
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,670
CPDs punched 'em in the face a few times.

296
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,150
Hit a couple of their stash houses

297
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,350
and a couple bank accounts.

298
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,070
We're thinking that there has to be an informant on the inside--

299
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:30,910
a snitch.

300
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,830
Just got the bloodwork back from the scene.

301
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,740
So some of the blood definitely belongs to Officer Ruzek.

302
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,220
But the good news is most of it belongs to someone else,

303
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,800
and we got a hit on CODIS.

304
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,350
This is Hector Alvaro Santiago,

305
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,290
date of birth 03/30/88.

306
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,320
He's in the gang database.

307
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,890
He's a known member of Los Tiranos.

308
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,410
He's got an LKA in Pilsen. 539 South Allport.

309
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,050
Nice work. Let's move.

310
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,910
Chicago PD!

311
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,530
Chicago PD. Hands up.

312
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,860
- You walk towards me. - What?

313
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,550
Hands in the air. Step towards me.

314
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,430
- No! - Get away from him.

315
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,320
Get up.

316
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,180
- No, no, no, no, no, no. - Where is Bob Ruzek?

317
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,170
- Who? - You know who--Bob Ruzek.

318
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,940
I don't know who that is.

319
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,900
Who else is in this house?

320
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,910
Hey. Where's Bob Ruzek?

321
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,800
I need you to hear me. Where is Bob Ruzek?

322
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,670
Tell me where he is.

323
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,810
Officer Bob Ruzek.

324
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:22,920
Your blood's all over his house.

325
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,910
We need to know why. Hey!

326
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,630
House is empty. He's not here.

327
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,870
Help him!

328
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,240
Don't you die on me.

329
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,260
Don't you die on me.

330
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,940
Where's my dad?

331
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,710
Hector!

332
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,500
- Where's my father? - Adam.

333
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,130
No!

334
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,580
5021E
5021 Eddie.

335
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,830
Roll a crime lab and ambo to 539 South Allport.

336
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,100
Okay, Elena, you and Hector were together for a year.

337
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,230
That's a very long time, okay?

338
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:00,310
That's a long time.

339
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,690
But I need you to remember. I need you to think.

340
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:06,100
Do you ever remember Hector using the name Bob Ruzek?

341
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,790
You keep saying that name.

342
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,230
Who is that?

343
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,660
All right. Tell me this.

344
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,060
When's the last time you saw Hector before he got injured?

345
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,350
Yesterday morning.

346
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,690
It was a regular day.

347
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,150
Dropped him on my way to the clinic.

348
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,100
The clinic?

349
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,440
Arden Family Health. I'm a nurse.

350
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,560
Got home from work, and I found him bleeding.

351
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,250
Okay. You're a nurse.

352
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,900
And you didn't bring him to the hospital?

353
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,180
Help me understand that.

354
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,420
He told me it was going to be up to me to save his life or not.

355
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,410
I knew he was going to bleed out eventually.

356
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,830
Begged him to go to the hospital.

357
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,470
- He wouldn't go. - Elena.

358
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,340
You're a nurse. Your man's bleeding out,

359
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,530
and he won't go to the hospital.

360
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,310
That didn't strike you as odd?

361
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,780
It didn't bring up any questions in your mind?

362
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,370
Did you know that he was in a gang?

363
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,140
- What? - Yes.

364
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,050
Hector was in a gang.

365
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,070
That's why he didn't want to go to the hospital.

366
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,910
Because he knew that if he showed up at an ER

367
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,890
bleeding out, someone like him was gonna start

368
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,530
getting asked questions that he didn't wanna answer.

369
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,940
- You lie. - No, he lied.

370
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,210
Did you know anything about the man?

371
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,040
Can I get a sec?

372
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,020
- Did you ask any questions at all? - Adam.

373
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,610
Voight was right to do the scrub.

374
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,520
I tracked everything that your dad tried to access

375
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,280
in the computer database, every keystroke.

376
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,720
Something there.

377
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,100
Something bad.

378
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,660
Three days ago, at the end of his shift,

379
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,490
your dad logged in to the gang database

380
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,190
and accessed the list of documented members of Los Tiranos.

381
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,430
Your dad doesn't work with gangs.

382
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,780
He doesn't work major crimes.

383
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,920
There's no reason that he would need that information.

384
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,660
- Right. - But it doesn't end there.

385
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,170
Because once he has the names,

386
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,630
he uses them to pull the field reports

387
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,900
for the recent operations targeting the gang.

388
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,660
And?

389
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,500
And one of those reports mentions a CI,

390
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,410
goes by the codename Merlin.

391
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,760
All right, but he doesn't know this Merlin, right?

392
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,380
- He said in the video-- - Adam.

393
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,160
He doesn't know who he is,

394
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,720
but it's not for lack of trying.

395
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,410
He tried to get Merlin's real name.

396
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,730
But he's just...

397
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,140
He's a patrol cop, and he doesn't have security clearance.

398
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,030
All right. All right.

399
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,040
I'm just gonna take a look at this.

400
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,170
I wanna retrace his steps again.

401
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,730
Adam.

402
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,600
Time's up, son.

403
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,240
We gotta do this.

404
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,850
Or not.

405
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,540
- You have a minute? - Yeah.

406
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,930
They sent a second video.

407
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,310
They put a clock on it.

408
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,660
They want the name of the snitch that's giving them trouble,

409
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,770
and they want it by noon tomorrow.

410
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,680
So we work all night.

411
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
We'll do whatever we gotta do--

412
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,130
Boss, boss, there's more.

413
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,560
My father's been doing favors for this gang--

414
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,360
at least he's been trying.

415
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,850
I just retraced his steps.

416
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,670
He used the arrest database to find his way to the snitch,

417
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,930
codename Merlin, and then he tried

418
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,660
to find the snitch's real name.

419
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,160
Um, if that's true...

420
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,150
It's a complete betrayal of the badge, I know.

421
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,310
But, uh, just because he tried doesn't mean he succeeded.

422
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,840
Story of Disco Bob's life.

423
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,450
No, he thinks you can do what he couldn't--

424
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,790
figure out who this Merlin is.

425
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,670
Well, he's not wrong.

426
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,340
I mean, we have higher clearance than Patrol.

427
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,960
I already got past the wall that he ran into.

428
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,880
Merlin works for a DA task force

429
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,050
that investigates cartels including Los Tiranos.

430
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,110
I mean, this CI, he's indexed in over 30 cases.

431
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,910
He is very good at what he does, whoever he is.

432
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,600
Okay, so...

433
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,190
Say you're me, right?

434
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,340
What happens next?

435
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,770
We find Merlin's real name. We make the trade.

436
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,190
So we make the trade.

437
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,960
Your old man walks out alive.

438
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,850
I mean, that's-- that's the hope, right?

439
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,230
But Merlin's dead.

440
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,670
That's for sure.

441
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,450
We're talking about trading one life for another.

442
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,510
But one life is Merlin, who's a gang member.

443
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,440
He's a rat.

444
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,120
Boss, you don't get to the position that Merlin's in

445
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,530
by living some clean life.

446
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,480
Adam.

447
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,610
You don't get to the position your father's in

448
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,480
by leading a clean life.

449
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,810
Do you?

450
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,680
No, sir.

451
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,560
But he's my father.

452
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,620
I would make the same trade for you every time.

453
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,390
I'm gonna go to the task force.

454
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,570
You stay out of this part.

455
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,450
- I'm taking Hailey. - All right.

456
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,160
Adam, listen to me.

457
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,780
I'm gonna get that name

458
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,090
because it's our best chance to find your father

459
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,920
on our own before the deadline

460
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,760
without making that trade.

461
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,900
You understand?

462
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,860
We're not in the business of signing execution papers.

463
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,970
So these pricks want Merlin's name.

464
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,970
Yeah, if we don't give it to 'em, they're gonna kill him--

465
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,110
the Chicago cop--tomorrow.

466
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,040
Well, we got some real problems here.

467
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,090
Who's that?

468
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,370
That's Merlin.

469
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,260
What?

470
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,050
Now she climbs the Tiranos ladder, but she works for us.

471
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,290
She's a gold mine.

472
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,060
She gets killed, that's two years of work up in smoke.

473
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,010
We're talking cartel-connected gangs from here to St. Louis.

474
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,140
Look--we don't want that any more than you do.

475
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,760
But a cop's life's on the line here,

476
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,920
and we're hoping that you can meet us in the middle.

477
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,330
How about instead of Merlin's name,

478
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,970
you give us someone else's?

479
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,090
Who?

480
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,930
The person who wants Merlin dead.

481
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,280
Give us that name.

482
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,620
Then we'll use that information to find Bob Ruzek.

483
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,570
We'll bring him in and protect your source.

484
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,860
Merlin's work has made one man's life a living hell.

485
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,240
His name is Lucas Barela.

486
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,100
Date of birth: 11/08/71.

487
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,540
Barela's the juice man of the gang.

488
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,190
His arm of the business is to launder money

489
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,460
by issuing cash loans to desperate people

490
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,640
at high interest rates.

491
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,300
Like cops with gambling issues.

492
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,790
Yeah. Like that.

493
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,360
Okay, remember, Lucas Barela is also a desperate man.

494
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,020
His life's at stake here too.

495
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,470
Yeah, so it was Barela's money houses that were hit by the cops,

496
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,330
Barela's bank accounts that were frozen.

497
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,930
We can thank Merlin for that.

498
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,700
So the task force has wiretaps up,

499
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,380
and we know that Barela's bosses have given him one more chance

500
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,410
to get his house in order, or he's dead.

501
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,100
Sarge, the grand jury transcripts you had me pull for the scrub.

502
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,150
- The guy who died, Hector Santiago... - Right.

503
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,020
His cousin is Barela. Also, his muscle. They were tight.

504
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,810
Hold on.

505
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,400
Santiago's girlfriend told me

506
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,200
she used to drop him off at some warehouse for work

507
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,200
on her way to, uh, Arden Family Health.

508
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,120
Arden Family Health.

509
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,310
Arden Family Health is on Bishop and 21st in Pilsen.

510
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,520
So why don't we run all the warehouses

511
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,480
between the clinic and Santiago's house?

512
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,890
Yeah. 19th and Aberdeen.

513
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,580
Closed three years ago.

514
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,390
Barela liquidated.

516
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,390
Got it. Barela's parents owned it before it went under.

517
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,830
The name's still on the deed.

518
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,560
Strap up. Go hit it.

519
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,030
All right, Coop, get 'em high.

520
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,910
Get 'em high.

521
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,240
Right there.

522
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,520
There you go.

523
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,060
I got you there. You got me here.

524
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,940
Copy.

526
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,270
We're in.

527
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,770
Dad?

528
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,350
I found him alive. Roll an ambo. Park it a block away.

529
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,020
Unknown number of offenders in the building.

530
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,040
Copy that.

531
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,210
Dad?

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,540
Here. Let's get you warm.

533
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,480
Here you go. Let's get you warm.

534
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,150
You're all right.

535
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,640
I knew it. I knew you'd come.

536
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,260
Keep your voice down.

537
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,710
- You're all right. - Yeah. All right.

538
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,130
Just be quiet.

539
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,420
How many are there? How many are there?

540
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,480
I don't know. I don't know.

541
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,370
Is it Barela--is that the one that did this to you?

542
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,200
I'm not sure.

543
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,390
They didn't use names.

544
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,450
- You okay to move? - Yeah, I think so.

545
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,770
Get up. Let's go home.

546
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,450
Okay.

547
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,910
I got you.

548
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,740
Go ahead. I got you.

549
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,500
- I got movement, lower level. - Copy.

550
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,290
Lucas Barela, don't move!

551
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,560
He's running west through the building--cover those exits.

552
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,030
Copy. We're coming around!

553
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,610
Stop!

554
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,870
All right, all right. Move with me.

555
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,210
Let's go wide. Go wide.

556
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,780
We got motion right here.

557
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,930
Chicago PD! Barela, stop!

558
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,810
- Out of the way! - Come on, move.

559
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,670
- Out of the way! - Stop!

560
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,280
- Come on, keep it moving. - Get out of the car.

561
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,060
Get out of here. Get out the way!

562
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,230
Move. Help her!

563
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,550
Help her! Help her!

564
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,760
Barela going down 19th in a civilian vehicle!

565
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,670
- Hey, Joy. - Adam, hey.

566
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,570
How's he doing?

567
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,020
Two broken ribs, some hypothermia.

568
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,130
He went through hell, but he'll be fine.

569
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,060
All right. That's good.

570
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,740
He okay to put on some real clothes?

571
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,130
Mm, close enough. He'll be out of here soon.

572
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,430
Thank you, Joy.

573
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,850
Officer.

574
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,380
Pa.

575
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,990
Ah, there he is.

576
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,180
Thanks, son.

577
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,120
All right, Pops.

578
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,110
Truth time.

579
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,770
You gotta tell me everything so we can find Lucas Barela.

580
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,080
Oh, the guy who took me?

581
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,980
Yeah.

582
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,810
Lu--Lucas? Wh--

583
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,860
- What'd you say? Barela? - Stop what you're doing.

584
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,120
You know exactly who he is.

585
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,230
You arrested him 25 years ago.

586
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,350
He got a reduced sentence in exchange for information.

587
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,440
He worked for you.

588
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,040
So you know exactly who Lucas Barela is, Dad.

589
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,160
Talk to me.

590
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,440
You're good, kid.

591
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,730
Back then, I was the guy in charge.

592
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,970
Barela was a street rat.

593
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,160
And over the years, you know, things changed.

594
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,280
I stayed right where I was,

595
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,170
but Barela, he climbed to the top.

596
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,880
And that's how paid off your debt with Benny.

597
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,220
You went to Barela, right?

598
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,620
Yeah.

599
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,050
- 10% a week. - Oh, my God.

600
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,350
What the hell is wrong with you?

601
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,450
You couldn't pay that off in a million years.

602
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,670
- What are you thinking? - I know.

603
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,300
He knew--he knew when he gave me the loan.

604
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,050
He knew when I couldn't pay him back,

605
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,330
he had me over a barrel.

606
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,550
He had a cop over a barrel.

607
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,940
That's worth more than--

608
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,290
more than any money.

609
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,300
So that's when he, uh--

610
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,480
he demanded that I, um,

611
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,180
find out the name of the snitch.

612
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,520
- And I-- - Came up short. I know.

613
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,320
So time was up.

614
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,800
And, uh, Barela and his guy...

615
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,660
- Hector Santiago. - Yeah.

616
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,940
They came to the house.

617
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,950
I fought like hell.

618
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,520
I probably hurt that Santiago pretty bad too,

619
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,990
but I--I couldn't get to my piece.

620
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,490
And...

621
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,520
Barela put a gun to my head.

622
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,580
Then--

623
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,080
and then that was-- that was it for me. I...

624
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,520
He was ready, and I...

625
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,310
And what, Dad?

626
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,960
I wasn't.

627
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,140
And I broke.

628
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,240
I did the only thing I could think of

629
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,750
to save my life-- I sold out my own son.

630
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,150
I told him that you were a cop, that you were a real cop,

631
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,860
that you were a better cop than I ever was,

632
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,980
and that you could find the name of that snitch.

633
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,460
I should've just taken the bullet.

634
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,490
I need to find Barela.

635
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,760
Now.

636
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,920
No.

637
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,110
What, Dad? What? No.

638
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,110
The man almost killed you.

639
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,080
What the hell are you talking about?

640
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,160
- You gotta let him walk. - I'm not letting him walk.

641
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,390
Why--why would you even say that, man?

642
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,450
Adam,

643
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,320
I've been borrowing money from him for years--

644
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,240
drug money.

645
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,120
And then trying to get the name of the informant?

646
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,930
You bring Barela in, that all comes out.

647
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,240
That's the end of me.

648
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,040
They'll bring charges. That'll be the end of my pension.

649
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,780
Our name will be destroyed.

650
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,050
Our name.

651
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,210
How is he?

652
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,750
Yeah. He'll be fine.

653
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,210
It's all right. Leave it open.

654
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,730
Sarge, um,

655
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,220
you know, if we find Barela and we bring him in,

656
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,540
what would really be gained by that?

657
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,950
Is that a real question?

658
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,150
It's just...

659
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,660
All this crap comes out, it's ugly.

660
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,240
My father's career, his pension.

661
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,380
Adam.

662
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,700
You gotta stop covering for him.

663
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,690
You gotta start taking care of you.

664
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,800
I am.

665
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,100
The name Ruzek's gonna stain this department,

666
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,750
and I gotta lug that around long after my dad is gone.

667
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,630
All the people that matter,

668
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,050
they know who you are.

669
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,500
I'm asking.

670
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,140
The answer's no.

671
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,680
We've been down this road before

672
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,790
with your old man, haven't we?

673
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,660
- Done things we had to do. - Yeah, I know.

674
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,240
And this is how he repays the favor?

675
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,360
Gets in bed with a new drug dealer.

676
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,270
Now you want me to just walk away?

677
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,400
We gave it a shot? We're moving on?

678
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,570
Olinsky told me my dad and you had beef.

679
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,670
He was a dog cop!

680
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,690
You think I'm not hearing you because of some beef

681
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,280
I had with your old man 20 years ago?

682
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,420
No.

683
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,610
Let me tell you something.

684
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:05,190
You do this to a cop--

685
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,050
put a gun to his head, pull him from his home--

686
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,350
you're not doing that to Disco Bob;

687
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,990
you're doing it to the Chicago Police.

688
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,480
You understand?

689
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,530
And we--we're gonna find Lucas Barela.

690
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,800
You can participate or not.

691
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,620
And I will be watching to see what you choose.

692
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,140
All right. What did we hear from our CIs?

693
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,750
Buttoned up pretty tight, Sarge.

694
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,040
So we're nowhere.

695
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Okay. The vehicle Barela stole?

696
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,660
Patrol found it. Torched.

697
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,780
Right. Safehouses, stash houses.

698
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:48,000
Barela's on the run. He's gotta be somewhere.

699
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,910
We've gone through every inch of intel.

700
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:52,240
- So we're nowhere. - Maybe not, Sarge.

701
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,090
This is the last piece from the scrub I did

702
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,960
- on Bob Ruzek's activity. - Okay.

703
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,100
This is the data from the chip from his squad car.

704
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,620
Now every single one of his patrol stops

705
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,070
can be justified as an on-duty call--

706
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,840
all except for this one.

707
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,230
2451 South May. It's in Pilsen.

708
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,550
- In the heart of Los Tiranos. - Exactly.

709
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,010
Bob Ruzek stopped there five times.

710
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,300
Never called it in. Always off the books.

711
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,290
Hold on, you guys. 2451 South May.

712
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,050
We've got Barela in that stolen civilian car on a traffic cam,

713
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,860
and he was a block away from there headed in that direction.

714
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,200
Let's move.

715
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,400
The cases we bent the rules on over the years.

716
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,020
The crooks we sent into the wind

717
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,180
because bringing 'em in was more trouble than it was worth,

718
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,570
but this one, we cling to like a dog on a bone.

719
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,470
The name Ruzek's gonna be a joke from here on out.

720
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,630
My dad's a jackass, but he's right about one thing.

721
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,240
Everybody'd be better off if Lucas Barela just...

722
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,570
went away.

723
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,990
We're four minutes out.

724
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,480
Move on the house but quiet till we're all there.

725
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,230
All right. Here we go.

726
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,740
On scene.

727
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,630
- I'll take the back. - Wait.

728
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,770
Hey. Back inside.

729
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,030
Get back inside now.

730
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,150
Adam!

731
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,540
Adam!

732
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,540
Adam!

733
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,120
What did you do?

734
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,310
5021I
5021 Ida.

735
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,820
Shots fired by the police. One offender down.

736
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,490
Roll the crime lab to our location.

737
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:45,060
Copy.

738
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,430
Street Deputy and IRT are on their way

739
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,830
to open the investigation.

740
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,080
All right. Good.

741
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,170
You wanna talk it through?

742
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,660
Yeah, sure.

743
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,780
Went to apprehend Barela.

744
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,970
He reached for his piece, so I put him down.

745
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,010
Shot three times, hit him three times.

746
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,170
Twice in the back.

747
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,000
It was a good shoot, boss.

748
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,480
IRT and COPA want to talk to me

749
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,160
about your state of mind.

750
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,110
I know I didn't see the shooting,

751
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,340
but they want my version.

752
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,680
Well, you didn't see it.

753
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,310
So what is there to say?

754
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,200
Right.

755
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,070
- It was a good shoot. - I hope so.

756
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,780
Yeah. What does that mean?

757
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,750
It means that I'm worried about you, okay?

758
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,690
I'm worried.

759
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,410
I have seen you going

760
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,860
through some stuff lately, and now this--

761
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,160
Kim, stop dancing around with me.

762
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,410
Say to me what you're really thinking.

763
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,230
Say it.

764
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,710
They got a video of the shoot.

765
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,980
Security camera, house next door.

766
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,580
Play it.

767
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,050
What's he saying to you?

768
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,950
He told me he knew who I was.

769
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:39,800
I wouldn't bring him in

770
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,830
because my father already promised to let him go,

771
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,680
and he'd ruin my father's career.

772
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,410
And that I was a little bitch like my old man.

773
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,090
I told him he was wrong.

774
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,000
He reached for his gun.

775
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,620
He was moving fast, and the first shot spun him around.

776
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,040
Second and third shots went through his back.

777
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,950
Good shoot.

778
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,270
That went down exactly like you said,

779
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,840
exactly as you reported to IRT.

780
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,620
- That's good work, Ruzek. - Thanks.

781
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,130
- Nice shoot. - Thanks.

782
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,360
Hey, Adam. How is he?

783
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,240
Oh, yeah. He's gonna be fine, Sarge.

784
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,530
He got out of the hospital yesterday, so.

785
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,200
- Thanks for asking, Sarge. - Yeah.

786
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,080
Hey, you know that stuff you said

787
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,330
about my old man coming into shift talking

788
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,570
about my little league games?

789
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,720
Yeah?

790
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,910
Total BS.

791
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:54,240
What?

792
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,350
Yeah. He made it up.

793
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,010
That was his shtick.

794
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,030
Couldn't be the real police.

795
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,320
Couldn't be the first guy through the door

796
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,990
because he was a family man.

797
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,940
Even if it hurt his career, he had to be home for dinner

798
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,120
and in the stands for my games.

799
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,540
He made it all up.

800
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,980
He was at the bar making bad bets.

801
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,730
I knew you weren't that good a hitter.

802
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,150
- Thanks, Sarge. - Yep.

803
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,070
Taking that over to the Deputy Supe?

804
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,870
Yeah, you know. Case like this, I gotta.

805
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,060
Yeah.

806
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,800
All it says is the truth.

807
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,500
Officer Ruzek was abducted

808
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,190
because the offender was under the mistaken belief

809
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,030
he knew the identity of a CI.

810
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,290
Anything else,

811
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,080
that'll die with Lucas Barela.

812
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,230
Boss.

813
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,970
I don't know what to say.

814
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,510
That's the best news I've had all day.

815
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,140
You must be damn proud, Adam.

816
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,360
Hell of a legacy to carry on.

817
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,230
Sure is.

818
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:17,500
Thanks, Duff.

819
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,500
We need to clear the air.

820
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:55,900
All right.

821
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,970
- Adam-- - When you ran up on me

822
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,980
after I shot Barela,

823
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,380
you could've asked me if I was okay,

824
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,950
if I was hurt-- that's not what you did.

825
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,760
- Adam, listen. - You said, "What did you do?"

826
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,960
Yeah, I did.

827
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,650
"What did you do?"

828
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,700
Kim,

829
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,120
one of the many reasons that I fell in love with you

830
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,260
is that I felt like you believed in me.

831
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,480
Like you believed in me

832
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,410
in a way that nobody in my entire life has.

833
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,010
I did.

834
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:30,450
- Even me. - I do.

835
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:31,910
I'm not so sure.

836
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,190
You have to see how what I said made sense in the moment.

837
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,370
You have to see that.

838
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,770
I don't.

839
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,670
After everything that you and I have been through,

840
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,880
there just should have been something that...

841
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,140
Held you back from the edge of assumption.

842
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,950
Some sort of guardrail

843
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,700
that kept you from going over that ledge.

844
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,150
I mean, if this situation is reversed--

845
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,610
I'm you; you're me--

846
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,930
and I run up on you.

847
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,620
You're standing over Barela holding the gun.

848
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,880
If I got close to the ledge, fine--I wouldn't go over.

849
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,010
Not ever.

850
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,550
I just...

851
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,950
'Cause I know your heart.

852
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,490
And I know that there's not a world in which

853
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,290
you'd kill a man in cold blood,

854
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,500
that you'd shoot him in the back as he's running away.

855
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,630
For what--revenge? For your family name?

856
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,780
Come on.

857
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,480
That's what you meant

858
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,220
when you said, "What did you do?"

859
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,890
And in that moment,

860
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:37,020
I'd have thought you'd know my heart.

861
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,050
You're supposed to know.

862
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,590
I do know your heart. I do.

863
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,970
And I am sorry.

864
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,500
- Just-- - I--

865
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,060
Thanks for stopping by.
