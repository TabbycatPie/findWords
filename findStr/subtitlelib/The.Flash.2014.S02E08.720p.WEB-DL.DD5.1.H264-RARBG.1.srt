1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,910
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,912 --> 00:00:05,930
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,932 --> 00:00:07,398
To the outside world,

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,350
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

5
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:12,236
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R Labs,

6
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:15,690
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:17,658
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,059
but in doing so,

9
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,228
I opened up our world to new threats.

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,565
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

11
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,667
I am The Flash.

12
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:29,754
Previously on "The Flash" and "Arrow"...

13
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:32,907
The person who broke into my facility
last night was Harrison Wells.

14
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,876
Dr. Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon,

15
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:37,929
meet Dr. Harrison Wells from Earth-2.

16
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:39,430
I came here to help you, Barry.

17
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:41,749
He may not be Harrison
Wells from your Earth.

18
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,851
He has just as many
secrets as the one you knew.

19
00:00:43,853 --> 00:00:46,771
I get these feelings
sometimes, these vibes.

20
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:50,108
I'm not sure what triggers
it. Sometimes it just happens.

21
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:54,428
You can always talk to me.

22
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,781
- Partners?
- Partners.

23
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:58,232
This is a million dollars.

24
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:00,485
That money is yours once you tell Oliver

25
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:02,770
that you've lost the baby.

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,774
I've been running a lot lately,

27
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:09,160
trying to go faster than
I've ever gone before.

28
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:10,912
Because there's someone out there

29
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:14,549
who's better, faster,
and stronger than I am,

30
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,551
and I need to be ready.

31
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:20,721
But no matter how much I try
or how hard I push myself,

32
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:23,057
I keep running into the same problem.

33
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,563
He just hit 1,375.

34
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:30,798
What's the fastest Barry's run?

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,635
Little over Mach two,
when he ran back in time.

36
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,237
That's not good.

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,824
That's good, Barry.

38
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:42,643
We have our work cut out for us.

39
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,079
- I'm not getting faster, am I?
- Well...

40
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:46,948
No, you're not.

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,200
All right, well, let's fix this, right?

42
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:50,835
I mean, I can't beat Zoom at this speed.

43
00:01:50,837 --> 00:01:52,486
It felt like I was
standing still next to him.

44
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,671
That's because you practically were.

45
00:01:53,673 --> 00:01:55,256
Zoom is at least three, four times

46
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:56,924
faster than you at this point.

47
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:59,544
How is he so much faster
than Barry is and Jay was?

48
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:03,931
Physiology, form, strength,
could be a number of things...

49
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,633
Attitude, diet.

50
00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:07,602
Okay, all right, well,
there's got to be something

51
00:02:07,604 --> 00:02:10,354
we can do about it, so
let's just figure it out...

52
00:02:10,356 --> 00:02:11,973
fast, okay?

53
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:14,559
All right, I got to go. I'm meeting Patty.

54
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:17,895
I'll see you. Thank you.

55
00:02:17,897 --> 00:02:19,680
So how are we going to help Barry?

56
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,232
I'm out of ideas,

57
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:22,683
and we've tried everything
you've suggested.

58
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:26,120
Well, not everything.

60
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:48,742
Welcome home.

61
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:50,410
- Any trouble?
- Nah.

62
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:52,680
But believe it or not, we
got ourselves a stowaway.

63
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,414
- He give you his name?
- Didn't say.

64
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,416
Sat in the brig silent for three weeks.

65
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:58,919
He was all decked out in
this when we found him.

66
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:02,923
- Jeez, how many are there?
- 32.

67
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:05,192
And I'll polish them
all in blood before long.

68
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:08,729
I've waited a long time for this hunt,

69
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:12,266
and you have brought me
very close to my prey.

70
00:03:12,268 --> 00:03:17,154
Mister, you're not going to do
any hunting in those handcuffs.

71
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:21,275
Oh, but, Captain, you're wearing the cuffs.

72
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,384
Who taught you that... Houdini?

73
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,169
Actually, I taught him.

74
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:04,001
Soon another sacrifice will be made.

75
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,172
I feel you out there.

76
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,934
Man, this was a bloodbath.

77
00:04:19,936 --> 00:04:21,835
Done by one person.

78
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:23,387
One person did all this?

79
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:25,189
Oh, yeah, you can see
from the blood pattern.

80
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:28,442
This guy was shot first,
then the police chief,

81
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,227
then these three were stabbed

82
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,229
before finishing off the captain.

83
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,514
Wow. Do you think a meta-human did it?

84
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,116
I don't know, but I found this

85
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:38,068
in all of the stab victims' wounds.

86
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,853
It's some type of cryptocrystalline...

87
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:41,355
Flint, most likely...

88
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:43,357
Probably broke off the
blade during the fight.

89
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,125
I'll run it to make sure.

90
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,294
Let's see what stores sell
those kind of flint knives.

91
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:48,879
Will do.

92
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,465
And, uh, I'll call you later.

93
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:53,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

94
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:54,969
So cute.

95
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,338
You guys are trying not to be
affectionate in front of me.

96
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,341
Oh, no, we're just showing
some professionalism.

97
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,142
Yeah.

98
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:13,520
Advantages of a trusting manager.

99
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:19,393
Oh, a lot's gone down in this place.

100
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:21,996
Nice.

101
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:23,163
So what's up?

102
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:27,084
I thought we were gonna go to dinner.

103
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,337
What's going on here?

104
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,873
I couldn't decide which
restaurant to go to,

105
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:36,043
so I thought we would create our own.

106
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,428
Voilà.

107
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,081
Short rib, Yukon gold puree, and asparagus.

108
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,416
Got to have a vegetable.

109
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:43,684
This is nice.

110
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:45,269
I like to cook.

111
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:47,554
I didn't know if you
like red or white, so...

112
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:48,856
I got you both.

113
00:05:48,858 --> 00:05:50,357
Ooh, two bottles.

114
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,893
That's kind dangerous, don't you think?

115
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,778
You're not gonna run away
all of a sudden, are you?

116
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,898
Trust me, I'm staying by
your side as long as possible.

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,567
Good.

118
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,270
You know, it's been really great

119
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:05,122
hanging out these last few weeks.

120
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:08,375
And it's helped make the
move a lot easier, so...

121
00:06:08,377 --> 00:06:09,443
thanks.

122
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:12,329
You're very welcome.

123
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,384
Sorry. How did you get in here?

124
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,003
Hey, man, this place is closed.

125
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:23,123
You are just as beautiful
in this life as any other,

126
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,391
Priestess Chay-Ara.

127
00:06:24,393 --> 00:06:25,643
Priestess?

128
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:27,895
You're going to have to go, dude.

129
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:30,731
Oh, not without her...

130
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:32,299
dude.

131
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:34,568
Oh, my God. Cisco.

132
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,803
I don't understand. What do you want?

133
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:39,523
I believe I was clear.

134
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,309
_

135
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,979
_

136
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:48,782
Kendra's not going anywhere
with you, Highlander.

137
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,334
Oh, is that your name now?

138
00:06:50,336 --> 00:06:53,954
Kendra... Quite boring.

139
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:57,041
I believe it allowed you
to blend in for a while.

140
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,843
Now, give her to me, and
I'll make your death fast.

141
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,962
It ain't gonna happen.

142
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:07,667
You are done here, pal.

143
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:09,470
So is he!

144
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:26,987
Thank God, Barry.

145
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:31,125
Dude, come on.

146
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,460
I can't believe you're The Flash.

147
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:35,629
And that you work with The Flash.

148
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,331
Yeah, let's keep that on the DL.

149
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,716
This is the same knife

150
00:07:38,718 --> 00:07:40,300
that was used to kill the men at the docks.

151
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,585
Residue is a perfect match.

152
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:42,970
- So it is the same guy.
- Definitely.

153
00:07:42,972 --> 00:07:45,005
But the thing is, these blades are old,

154
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,640
centuries old.

155
00:07:46,642 --> 00:07:48,809
Do you have any idea why
this guy would be after you?

156
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:51,562
No, I've never seen him before in my life.

157
00:07:51,564 --> 00:07:53,313
Well, he was certainly
acting like he knew you.

158
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,649
He kept calling her Priestess Chay-Ara.

159
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:56,883
That's Coptic.

160
00:07:56,885 --> 00:07:58,652
- You mean Egyptian?
- That's right.

161
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:00,887
Well, I grew up in Wisconsin,

162
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:04,158
and I've never even left the States, so...

163
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,744
This guy, he's clearly
incredibly dangerous,

164
00:08:06,746 --> 00:08:09,246
so I need you to at least
let us try to protect you.

165
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:10,581
I can put a detail on her.

166
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,898
You didn't see this guy, Joe.

167
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,117
No offense, but I don't think a cop

168
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,835
is going to be able to protect her.

169
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:18,172
No, but we do have a few
friends who could lend a hand.

170
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:19,739
But we're going to need
to leave Central City.

171
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,409
And go where?

172
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,344
You really want to go to Star City?

173
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:26,296
Come on, we don't need Team Arrow's help.

174
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,015
Yeah, I think we do, man.

175
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:29,633
Man, you've fought
meta-humans with abilities

176
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,301
a lot worse than knife-throwing.

177
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,770
I don't think this guy's a meta-human.

178
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:35,088
There's something different about him,

179
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,524
something, ah, mystical.

180
00:08:37,526 --> 00:08:39,226
Mystical, really?

181
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,061
We stop meta-humans
because we're scientists.

182
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,980
We can figure out what
their weaknesses are,

183
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,599
but we don't have any experience
when it comes to guys like this,

184
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,401
with magic.

185
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,452
They do.

186
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:49,570
This wouldn't have

187
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,038
anything to do with Zoom, would it?

188
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,372
No.

189
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:53,607
I'm just trying to keep Kendra safe.

190
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:54,992
This is the best way to do that.

191
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,960
Right. Okay, I'm with you.

192
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:59,213
But how do we even know Oliver and them

193
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:00,914
even have time to help us?

194
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,382
How busy can they be?

195
00:09:08,457 --> 00:09:10,174
Oh, gosh, that's fun.

196
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:12,092
I really could do this all day.

197
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:15,062
Open it up.

198
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:17,631
They could've at least tried
to hide this chemical bomb.

199
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:20,901
Serves them right, it getting
stolen and used against them.

200
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:27,107
Oh, you brought arrows to a gunfight.

201
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,942
What guns?

202
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,532
Oh, that was actually pretty clever.

203
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,584
Kill them.

204
00:09:45,677 --> 00:09:48,512
"Felicity, the magnetic-arrow
gag will never work."

205
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:50,830
Yes, it will, my love,

206
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:53,100
because I am really smart.

207
00:09:53,102 --> 00:09:55,302
And guess what, Oliver. It did work.

208
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,221
Felicity, honey, it's a
little hard to fight

209
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,772
with you doing that in my ear.

210
00:09:58,774 --> 00:10:00,774
Oh, I totally forgot that
this was an open line.

211
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:03,110
Keep doing what you're
doing. Make smart decisions.

212
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,668
Ooh! You know, I got to be honest.

213
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,138
I really thought we'd be
doing this dance a lot longer.

214
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
Night-night.

215
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,715
What was that?

216
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:46,520
Damn it.

217
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:48,155
Every time.

218
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:50,107
It's The Flash.

219
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,609
Did I know we knew The Flash?

220
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,661
We know The Flash. Okay.

221
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,663
- I didn't know we knew The Flash.
- Thank you.

222
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:59,032
But I don't think you ran all
the way here to protect us.

223
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,568
No, not to protect you.

224
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,921
I need to protect a friend.

225
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:12,227
Wow.

226
00:11:12,229 --> 00:11:15,230
Nice new digs.

227
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,899
Also, I just noticed, no sleeves.

228
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:18,434
Don't you get cold?

229
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:20,169
I spent the better part
of five years on an island

230
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:21,420
in the North China Sea.

231
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:22,788
I don't get cold, Barry.

232
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,906
Barry, it's so good to see you.

233
00:11:24,908 --> 00:11:26,875
Felicity.

234
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:28,610
Good to see you, Felicity.

235
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:30,345
How come you didn't tell
me Zoom broke your back?

236
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:33,715
- I...
- Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

237
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:35,050
So this is what it's like dating her?

238
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:37,252
More bruises from her
than from Deathstroke.

239
00:11:37,254 --> 00:11:41,306
Okay, S.T.A.R. Labs is
impressive, but this is...

240
00:11:41,308 --> 00:11:44,026
This is completely wrong!

241
00:11:44,028 --> 00:11:46,311
Did you guys even look
at the specs I sent over?

242
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:47,863
This is a tragedy.

243
00:11:47,865 --> 00:11:49,865
I'm mourning for the death of engineering.

244
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:52,734
Copper wiring to handle
the processing speed

245
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,036
from the Palmer Satellite,

246
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:56,438
or else your system is gonna overload.

247
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,939
Yeah, but that hasn't happened.

248
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:59,458
I mean, it hasn't happened since last week.

249
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,993
I mean, it didn't... It happened yesterday.

250
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:02,494
- Hi.
- I'm Felicity.

251
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:06,882
I'm Kendra Saunders. I'm Cisco's...

252
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:10,219
She's, uh, my, uh, new, beautiful friend

253
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:13,305
who kisses me occasionally.

254
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:17,593
Right. I'm Thea.

255
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:19,928
This is John Diggle and my brother.

256
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,979
Oliver Queen.

257
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:22,397
- Yeah, I know.
- Hi.

258
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,149
Wow. Okay, first to meet The Flash

259
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:26,685
and now the Green Arrow.

260
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,070
Do you have any other surprises for me?

261
00:12:28,072 --> 00:12:30,822
Please, no more surprises.

262
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:32,641
Barry said that you need our help.

263
00:12:32,643 --> 00:12:34,693
Somebody very dangerous is after you.

264
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:37,329
Yeah, and I have no idea why.

265
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,314
What does this guy even look like?

266
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:41,483
Hold on.

267
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,090
Okay, this is him.

268
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:50,375
Yeah, see, that's something
I would never think of.

269
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:52,844
Hey, kind of rocking
that Dothraki look... hot.

270
00:12:52,846 --> 00:12:54,846
Let's see if facial
recognition can find a match.

271
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:04,022
- That's him.
- Yeah, strange.

272
00:13:04,024 --> 00:13:06,108
This picture's from 1975.

273
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,110
Which would make him about
80 years old right now.

274
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:10,696
Okay, what else can you tell us?

275
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,481
He said we've known each other for ages,

276
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,366
but I've never met the man before.

277
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:16,318
There has to be some kind of connection.

278
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,036
Not one I can think of.

279
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:20,706
I just moved to Central
City six months ago.

280
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,124
Why'd you move there?

281
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:24,793
I just felt drawn to the city, I guess.

282
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:27,028
Kendra, there is a reason
this guy's after you.

283
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,630
Think.

284
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:30,666
Look, man, we just came out
here to hide out for a bit

285
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:33,252
until we figure things out,
so you can just take it down...

286
00:13:33,254 --> 00:13:34,586
You came here because you need our help.

287
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:36,305
This is what my help looks like.

288
00:13:36,307 --> 00:13:38,257
Oliver, I just saved you
guys from whatever the hell

289
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,508
Flock of Seagulls was about to do.

290
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,709
The least you can do is...

291
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:42,477
Barry, none of us have superpowers.

292
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,146
You brought Kendra into our world

293
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,597
without knowing who she is

294
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,882
or what this dude that is
after her is looking for.

295
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:49,818
You made all of us unsafe.

296
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,320
So maybe you ask the questions.

297
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:57,159
We're all friends here, right?

298
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,360
Why don't we go back to our place

299
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:00,495
and have some drinks, and we can talk?

300
00:14:00,497 --> 00:14:01,947
Cool.

301
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:05,066
What you working on?

302
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:07,252
This is a formula

303
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:10,038
meant to increase a speedster's velocity

304
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,072
that I've been developing

305
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:13,342
since Zoom showed up on my Earth.

306
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:16,628
Ironically, this was meant
to help out Jay Garrick.

307
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,764
You want to give Barry a
drug to make him run faster?

308
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,717
Temporarily enhance the Speed
Force in his system, yes.

309
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:24,102
So you're trying to make
nitrous oxide for speedsters.

310
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,554
Good analogy. Yes, I tried.

311
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:27,389
Five times I tried. Five times I failed.

312
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,358
That's what you get when
your background is technology

313
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,525
and not biochemistry.

314
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,394
Well, then you are lucky I am here.

315
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:33,595
What does that mean?

316
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:34,929
You've been thinking of this

317
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:37,232
as a mechanical problem,
not a biomechanical one.

318
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:38,483
And what does that mean?

319
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:40,068
When a speedster runs, they consume

320
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,287
an extraordinary amount of oxygen,

321
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,156
so we just need something
to give an extra boost

322
00:14:44,158 --> 00:14:45,407
of oxygen during that time.

323
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,075
Like an oxygen generator.

324
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:48,126
Exactly.

325
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,745
So we just need a chemical

326
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:52,280
that's rich in oxygen that would release it

327
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:55,083
as a nearly pure gas as it decomposes...

328
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:56,218
Something like...

329
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,803
Sodium chlorate.

330
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:00,339
Then all we'd need is
heat to release the oxygen.

331
00:15:00,341 --> 00:15:02,174
Which a speedster generates naturally

332
00:15:02,176 --> 00:15:04,726
in the form of lightning.

333
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:06,478
I think something like
this just might work.

334
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,230
You think you can help me figure it out?

335
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:10,465
I can certainly try.

336
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:13,134
I'm not changing my nickname.

337
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,486
I like Speedy.

338
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:16,154
Are you familiar with my body of work?

339
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,407
If you are, then you know
I can come up with something

340
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:20,692
so much better than Speedy.

341
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:23,245
Why don't you get a haircut?

342
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:25,080
And then maybe we can talk about it.

343
00:15:25,082 --> 00:15:26,748
I think you're just mad
because my conditioner game

344
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,999
is on point.

345
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:30,752
So the CEO of Palmer Technologies

346
00:15:30,754 --> 00:15:32,537
is living with Oliver Queen.

347
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:35,040
It's insane how much life
can change in six months, huh?

348
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,708
Which you would know better than anyone,

349
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,660
considering that there's another Flash,

350
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:42,297
another Dr. Wells, from another... earth.

351
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:43,632
I mean...

352
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:45,667
Yeah. No, it's been trippy lately.

353
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:47,269
I wonder what Oliver's
doppelganger would look like.

354
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:51,005
- Bald, pot-bellied...
- Uh-huh.

355
00:15:51,007 --> 00:15:55,343
Agreeable.

356
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:56,445
You seeing anyone?

357
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:58,697
- I am, actually.
- Good.

358
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,115
Patty is her name.

359
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,616
She's amazing.

360
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,518
You deserve someone amazing.

361
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Thanks.

362
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:08,240
My pigs in a blanket!

363
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:10,375
Hey, Ollie, um...

364
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:13,328
look, I'm sorry that I
laid all of this on you.

365
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,130
- I know that it wasn't fair.
- It's okay.

366
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:16,865
I'm sorry if earlier I was a little...

367
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:18,500
Snippy?

368
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:19,918
I have been called worse.

369
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,169
No, but I'm glad that you're here.

370
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:22,537
I'm glad you reached out.

371
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:24,473
It shows a real maturity,
and I would know that

372
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:26,308
because I've never been that mature.

373
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:29,311
I'm always here for you.

374
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,645
Thank you.

375
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:32,647
I got to say, this isn't the same

376
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:34,215
Arrow team I'm used to seeing

377
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,017
or the same Oliver Queen.

378
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,436
- You seem really...
- Happy?

379
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:39,738
- Happy, yeah.
- I am happy.

380
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,656
I finally have everything
that I've ever wanted.

381
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:46,278
Being with Felicity has given
me a real sense of peace,

382
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,330
something that I haven't
had in a long time.

383
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:51,232
Didn't you tell me that guys
like us don't get the girl?

384
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:52,751
Yep.

385
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:54,202
I was wrong.

386
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,707
I would like to propose a toast.

387
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,544
I wish it wasn't just the dark
times bringing us together.

388
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:05,413
But it is friends like you

389
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:07,933
that make those dark times worth having.

390
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,184
What a guy.

391
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:10,886
Steals my drinks, steals my words.

392
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:12,971
As I was saying, it's good to see everyone.

393
00:17:12,973 --> 00:17:14,055
- Yes.
- Cheers.

394
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:14,973
Cheers.

395
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,608
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

396
00:17:20,262 --> 00:17:21,813
Look, don't worry, all right?

397
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:22,864
We're gonna keep her safe.

398
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,866
- I promise.
- Yeah, I know.

399
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,402
Look, there's something I never told you.

400
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:30,772
The first time I kissed
Kendra, I got a vibe.

401
00:17:30,774 --> 00:17:32,240
No, not like that kind of vibe.

402
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:34,459
Like, I vibed vibed.

403
00:17:34,461 --> 00:17:36,127
Remember the man with wings?

404
00:17:36,129 --> 00:17:37,412
It wasn't a man.

405
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:39,080
It was Kendra.

406
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:41,082
She was, like, a bird.

407
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:42,634
You think that she's a meta-human?

408
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,171
Wait. Why didn't you say
anything about this sooner?

409
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:47,422
Well, I didn't think it was related,

410
00:17:47,424 --> 00:17:50,141
but I guess now it has to be.

411
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:54,796
Look, I don't want her
to know about my powers.

412
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,132
I have this great thing going with her.

413
00:17:58,134 --> 00:18:01,570
She laughs at my jokes,
and she loves movies,

414
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:03,772
and...

415
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:05,991
I just... I've never felt like this before,

416
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:09,310
and I don't want to sabotage it.

417
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:10,745
I get the feeling.

418
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:13,164
Look!

419
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,673
I will always find you, Chay-Ara.

420
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:27,379
- Don't move.
- Then how will I kill you all?

421
00:18:59,695 --> 00:19:01,496
Yeah, I can do that too.

422
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:15,060
Thea, no!

423
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:23,685
What did you do?

424
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:25,553
I ended it.

425
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:30,058
This is why we ask questions.

426
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,332
Wait. W-where did he go?

427
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:41,620
Oh, boy.

428
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:51,276
Okay.

429
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,361
Thanks.

430
00:19:53,363 --> 00:19:57,348
All right, Lance is gonna call
if he gets any information on...

431
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,534
whoever that is.

432
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,820
I know where we can get some info.

433
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:09,694
Kendra, I have powers.

434
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:13,865
I get these vibes from people.

435
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:17,302
They're visions of meta-humans,

436
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:19,037
and I had one of you.

437
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,557
So, A, you're saying you're a meta-human,

438
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,225
and, B, she's a meta-human?

439
00:20:24,227 --> 00:20:25,644
I don't know.

440
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:29,097
In these visions, you could fly.

441
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,817
It was like you were a bird of some sort.

442
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:35,320
- A bird?
- Yeah.

443
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:36,738
What else did you see?

444
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,525
That's it... just you with wings.

445
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:43,411
Oh, I did not see that one coming.

446
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,836
Oh, I think there's a
lot you didn't see coming.

447
00:20:51,838 --> 00:20:54,572
- Great. More surprises.
- Who the hell is this?

448
00:20:54,574 --> 00:20:56,174
It's my dad.

449
00:21:05,851 --> 00:21:07,552
I think I did it.

450
00:21:11,757 --> 00:21:13,191
What do you know, Snow?

451
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:15,026
I think you did do it.

452
00:21:18,197 --> 00:21:20,598
Velocity-6?

453
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,283
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?

454
00:21:22,285 --> 00:21:25,403
You get me to come here so
I can take your speed drug?

455
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:26,705
That's right.

456
00:21:26,707 --> 00:21:28,623
- You knew about this.
- Of course she did.

457
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,909
She figured it out.

458
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:32,944
I thought this was to help Barry.

459
00:21:32,946 --> 00:21:34,546
It is to help Barry, which is why we need

460
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:35,880
to do test runs on subjects

461
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:38,083
who once had the Speed
Force in their system.

462
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:39,951
The Speed Force doesn't work like that.

463
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:42,721
It's not something you can create in a lab.

464
00:21:42,723 --> 00:21:44,806
How do you think you
became The Flash, Garrick?

465
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:46,257
By me and a lab.

466
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,394
Science is what did this
to you, to Barry, to Zoom,

467
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:51,229
and science is what we need to stop Zoom,

468
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:52,230
and this is our only option.

469
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:53,865
Find another one.

470
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,567
The Speed Force can't be
replicated or enhanced.

471
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:56,851
It's a living thing.

472
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:58,570
It's a gift that was given to me.

473
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:00,355
That drug... you have no
idea what it's gonna do.

474
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:01,823
I'm not going to let another
one of your experiments

475
00:22:01,825 --> 00:22:03,324
mess with me again, Harrison.

476
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:05,076
You find someone else
to be your guinea pig.

477
00:22:05,078 --> 00:22:06,528
Jay.

478
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:10,415
Caitlin, keep that serum away from Barry.

479
00:22:10,417 --> 00:22:12,283
- Where are you going?
- To pick up what we need.

480
00:22:12,285 --> 00:22:14,485
Wait. Jay just said we
shouldn't give it to Barry.

481
00:22:14,487 --> 00:22:17,655
We're gonna do what we need.

482
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:23,711
The man you're looking
for is Vandal Savage.

483
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:24,763
Vandal Savage? Never heard of him.

484
00:22:24,765 --> 00:22:26,431
Well, who is he?

485
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,383
Some say he was the most
trusted adviser to Genghis Khan.

486
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:29,684
Others say he guided Julius Caesar

487
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:31,052
through the Gallic Wars.

488
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:34,639
But one thing the League knows for sure...

489
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:35,840
He was there for all of it.

490
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:37,192
So what are you saying?

491
00:22:37,194 --> 00:22:38,476
He's like a vampire or something?

492
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:41,396
Not a vampire, an Immortal.

493
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:43,481
Okay, we've officially
stepped into crazy town.

494
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:44,732
Immortality?

495
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:46,451
Wait. No, no, no, this makes sense.

496
00:22:46,453 --> 00:22:50,371
This explains why he looks
the same as he did in 1975.

497
00:22:50,373 --> 00:22:51,906
This can't be possible.

498
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:55,710
There's nothing you can do to save her now.

499
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:57,862
Kendra, do not listen to him.

500
00:22:57,864 --> 00:23:00,465
I... I just need some air.

501
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:07,555
Hey, we're gonna do

502
00:23:07,557 --> 00:23:09,307
whatever we have to to keep Kendra safe,

503
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,176
whether you think we can or not.

504
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:12,760
Hey, Joe, it's Patty.

505
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:14,846
I just interviewed a weapons
expert about the flint knife

506
00:23:14,848 --> 00:23:16,214
our attacker used.

507
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:18,266
Found out something pretty interesting,

508
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:20,185
so call me back.

509
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:27,325
Harrison Wells?

510
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:28,693
Kendra!

511
00:23:28,695 --> 00:23:32,247
Hey, you going to be all right?

512
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:34,165
It's just a lot to take in right now.

513
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,234
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about me before.

514
00:23:36,236 --> 00:23:39,403
I didn't want things to
be different between us.

515
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:40,922
It's not that, Cisco.

516
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:42,790
If what everyone's saying is true...

517
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:44,509
And it's beginning to seem like it is...

518
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:47,378
My whole life just changed,

519
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,297
and I am so not ready for that.

520
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:52,383
I hear what you're saying. I do.

521
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:57,188
When I first learned about my powers,

522
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,141
I remember feeling that exact same feeling,

523
00:24:00,143 --> 00:24:02,093
and sometimes I still feel that way,

524
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:05,429
and all I can say is...

525
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:10,285
every day gets a little bit more normal.

526
00:24:11,987 --> 00:24:13,204
I promise you.

527
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,792
Thank you.

528
00:24:17,794 --> 00:24:19,244
You're so welcome.

529
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,782
- Aah!
- Kendra!

530
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:26,968
Help!

531
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,027
Guys, did you find anything?

532
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,428
I'm on it!

533
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,264
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is my house.

534
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:43,283
Don't worry. We're going to find her.

535
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:55,778
Wow. You look as beautiful as ever.

536
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,048
Chay-Ara, it's me, Khufu.

537
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,509
Do you remember?

538
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:11,460
Look at me.

539
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:15,148
- You need to wake up.
- What are you talking about?

540
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,632
I don't know who you are.

541
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,351
You will once you emerge.

542
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:20,019
Until then, you need to stay by my side

543
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,354
so that I can protect you.

544
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,189
Protect me? From what?

545
00:25:23,191 --> 00:25:26,860
The man who's hunting you, Vandal Savage.

546
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,695
I got them! 57th Street tower.

547
00:25:28,697 --> 00:25:30,280
I'm right near there.

548
00:25:30,282 --> 00:25:31,981
Always a pleasure watching you work, Smoak.

549
00:25:31,983 --> 00:25:33,416
Yeah!

550
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:34,784
- Ow.
- That was pitiful.

551
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:36,452
I know this is a lot to take in,

552
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:38,454
but you sort of just kind
of have to trust me on this.

553
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:39,856
I...

554
00:25:39,858 --> 00:25:42,292
Just one second.

555
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:43,626
Stay right there.

556
00:25:51,602 --> 00:25:53,186
I got eyes on him.

557
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:11,120
- Give me the girl.
- Not gonna do that, Robin Hood.

558
00:26:11,122 --> 00:26:13,990
- You're making a big mistake.
- I'll take my chances.

559
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,994
Barry, change of venue.

560
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:20,529
Birdman and Oliver are at
54th and Motor now... hurry!

561
00:26:20,531 --> 00:26:21,714
On my way!

562
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,858
- We need to expose his wings.
- I'm open to suggestions.

563
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,361
- Now you're listening to me?
- It's your city, Oliver.

564
00:26:51,363 --> 00:26:52,363
All right.

565
00:27:38,826 --> 00:27:40,943
That's new.

566
00:27:40,945 --> 00:27:43,579
Yep, comes in handy.

567
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,170
We can't use that serum on Barry.

568
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:53,139
That's up to him, isn't it?

569
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:57,293
If Barry wants to stop
Zoom, this is what he needs.

570
00:27:57,295 --> 00:27:58,794
Jay said it could hurt Barry.

571
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:00,430
Well, Jay's a coward.

572
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,899
Jay's a scientist who knows
a lot about speedsters.

573
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:04,984
- You're a scientist, Snow.
- You've been watching Barry.

574
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:07,520
You know he's nowhere near
as fast as he needs to be.

575
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:09,906
This other mentor, this
other Harrison Wells,

576
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:12,492
did not want him to reach
his full potential... I do.

577
00:28:12,494 --> 00:28:14,477
You know, you're really starting to sound

578
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,828
a lot like him.

579
00:28:18,449 --> 00:28:21,534
Put your hands in the air.

580
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:23,953
- Who are you?
- You're under arrest.

581
00:28:23,955 --> 00:28:25,088
Doctor McGee was right.

582
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,123
- She did see you.
- Christina McGee?

583
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:29,158
At Mercury Labs.

584
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,676
You're Harrison Wells.

585
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:31,928
Yes, I'm Harrison Wells.

586
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,162
- I'm not the Harrison...
- Stop!

587
00:28:33,164 --> 00:28:34,297
You move closer, and I'll shoot.

588
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,765
Give me that...

589
00:28:46,443 --> 00:28:48,844
Oh, my God, what have you done?

590
00:28:48,846 --> 00:28:49,846
Harrison?

591
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:52,148
Harrison, stay with me.

592
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,897
Harrison, Harrison, stay with me.

593
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:00,568
Stay with me, Harrison, come on.

594
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,320
- Why did you shoot him?
- I thought that was a gun.

595
00:29:02,322 --> 00:29:03,822
- I'm sorry. I'll call 911.
- No, don't!

596
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:05,457
- Why?
- Because this...

597
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,008
Didn't Joe West explain this to you?

598
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,676
- No.
- Just call Joe.

599
00:29:08,678 --> 00:29:10,728
Okay.

600
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:25,660
Where is she?

601
00:29:25,662 --> 00:29:26,861
What's your name?

602
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:28,413
You're putting her in danger,

603
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:29,864
and I'm the only one capable of saving her.

604
00:29:29,866 --> 00:29:31,649
You have a very interesting perspective

605
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:33,368
on what the word "saving" means.

606
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,036
She's the love of my lifetime, sweetheart.

607
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,422
I was not gonna hurt her.

608
00:29:37,424 --> 00:29:39,624
You need to let me go.

609
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:45,296
Chay-Ara.

610
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:47,498
My name is Kendra Saunders.

611
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,883
In this life.

612
00:29:48,885 --> 00:29:51,135
And I am... was Carter Hall,

613
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,170
but that is not who we are.

614
00:29:53,172 --> 00:29:54,973
What does that mean?

615
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:57,609
You're Priestess
Chay-Ara. I'm Prince Khufu.

616
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,143
And we're lovers.

617
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,562
Soul mates.

618
00:30:00,564 --> 00:30:03,147
We've been partners for 4,000 years.

619
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:04,899
We're drawn to each other in
each life, and after we die,

620
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,952
we reincarnate to find each
other again and again and again.

621
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:10,705
And now that I've found you, we
should really get out of here.

622
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:13,374
Okay, Romeo, why don't you pump the brakes?

623
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:16,211
These people cannot protect
you from Savage any longer.

624
00:30:16,213 --> 00:30:19,714
Do you know who Vandal Savage is?

625
00:30:19,716 --> 00:30:23,751
In every lifetime, he
hunts us down and kills us.

626
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:25,870
He's done it 206 times,

627
00:30:25,872 --> 00:30:27,805
and I'm not planning to make it 207.

628
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:29,591
Why does he kill you?

629
00:30:29,593 --> 00:30:32,810
His life force is tethered to ours.

630
00:30:32,812 --> 00:30:34,512
Every time he kills us,
he becomes more powerful.

631
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:35,647
You do the math.

632
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:37,181
You're 0 for 206,

633
00:30:37,183 --> 00:30:39,484
and you still think
you're her best bet, hmm?

634
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:41,986
Okay, so what we need
to do is just find Savage

635
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:43,855
and get rid of him.

636
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:46,441
Well, you can't get rid of him, my friend.

637
00:30:46,443 --> 00:30:49,077
Oh, yeah? Watch us.

638
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,945
It might be harder than you think.

639
00:30:50,947 --> 00:30:54,198
Is that the only way this
guy knows how to enter a room?

640
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,335
My associates tell me Savage
left Star City a few hours ago.

641
00:30:57,337 --> 00:30:58,953
- For where?
- We're not quite sure.

642
00:30:58,955 --> 00:31:00,538
But I assume after his run-in with you,

643
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,740
he realized he needed
something more powerful

644
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:04,876
to complete his mission.

645
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:07,629
We think he's trying to
locate the Staff of Horus.

646
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:09,580
Sorry, what is that?

647
00:31:09,582 --> 00:31:11,248
It's a relic from our past...

648
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,636
An ancient and powerful weapon.

649
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:16,554
If Savage gets his hands on it,

650
00:31:16,556 --> 00:31:18,523
it's going to be nearly
impossible to stop him.

651
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:20,224
Since when did our lives suddenly become

652
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:21,943
an "Indiana Jones" movie?

653
00:31:21,945 --> 00:31:23,260
- Felicity?
- Yeah?

654
00:31:23,262 --> 00:31:24,729
- Think you can find it?
- Yeah.

655
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:26,263
It's probably at some museum somewhere.

656
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:29,567
I'll, work my magic,
see what I can find.

657
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:31,953
We're running out of time.

658
00:31:31,955 --> 00:31:34,539
You need to emerge now.

659
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,991
Come on, what is it gonna
take for you to believe me?

660
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,576
You saw my wings.

661
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:40,945
I know you know this is true.

662
00:31:40,947 --> 00:31:43,114
Please, just let me show you how.

663
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,140
- How's he doing?
- He's losing oxygen.

664
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:53,624
- I need you to leave.
- Joe, I...

665
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:56,511
Patty, go.

666
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:58,479
There's a bullet in a branch
of his pulmonary artery

667
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:01,432
that's blocking off most of the
blood flow from the left lung.

668
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:02,767
Are we able to get the bullet out?

669
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:04,435
Not without causing too much damage.

670
00:32:04,437 --> 00:32:05,987
I need Jay's help.

671
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:20,385
So...

672
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:23,454
you just want me to jump.

673
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:25,757
Fall, jump, swan dive, whatever suits you.

674
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,675
Just, do it.

675
00:32:27,677 --> 00:32:29,961
Okay, this isn't the X Games.

676
00:32:29,963 --> 00:32:31,679
And this is how she emerges...

677
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:35,016
She just falls towards her death?

678
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:38,102
Yep. 4,000 years of experience
says that's exactly how.

679
00:32:38,104 --> 00:32:39,336
Just watch and learn.

680
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,688
No, I'm sorry. What are we doing?

681
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,640
Why are we listening to this guy?

682
00:32:42,642 --> 00:32:43,975
Come on, Oliver, you're supposed to be

683
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:45,560
the one who asks questions.

684
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:48,780
Okay, but after what we
saw, after what Cisco said,

685
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:52,016
I cannot believe I'm going
to say this, but it...

686
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:54,518
kind of makes sense.

687
00:32:57,689 --> 00:32:59,457
Hey, hey, hey!

688
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:06,464
- I need to try.
- Are you serious?

689
00:33:06,466 --> 00:33:08,549
Yes, she is.

690
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:11,502
Barry!

691
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:18,709
- What the hell was that?
- Saving her life.

692
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:19,877
You should have emerged.

693
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:21,396
Something is blocking you.

694
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:22,847
Well, we should just try
again and see what's...

695
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:24,148
- No!
- Yeah, no, no, no, no.

696
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,549
We're not doing that again.

697
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:26,818
Kendra, you don't have to do this.

698
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,853
Oliver, we can stop Savage, okay?

699
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:30,221
Barry. Barry!

700
00:33:30,223 --> 00:33:33,574
What?

701
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:36,727
Talk to you for a second?

702
00:33:36,729 --> 00:33:37,695
Okay.

703
00:33:37,697 --> 00:33:38,996
Keep an eye on him.

704
00:33:42,234 --> 00:33:43,835
What is going on with you?

705
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:45,286
I'm trying to keep her alive.

706
00:33:45,288 --> 00:33:47,422
- Then I think we let her jump.
- Are you kidding?

707
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:49,240
Barry, I get that you're desperate to help

708
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,458
and you want to be the hero

709
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,009
and you want to save her yourself,

710
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:54,912
but I think she has to
have a part in it too.

711
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,183
It's just... the rules keep changing.

712
00:33:59,185 --> 00:34:00,852
One day I have to run through time,

713
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:02,804
the next I'm fighting a telepathic gorilla,

714
00:34:02,806 --> 00:34:04,722
and now we're what?

715
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:07,358
We're chasing down an
immortal madman on a rampage

716
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,528
against down a reincarnated
warrior priestess?

717
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,198
I just never thought I'd have superpowers

718
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,567
and feel more powerless than
I ever have in my entire life.

719
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:18,035
That part I understand.

720
00:34:18,037 --> 00:34:20,437
But you have already helped Kendra.

721
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:22,457
You have kept her alive.

722
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:24,075
So now let's help her get her wings,

723
00:34:24,077 --> 00:34:27,044
and then she can give you
a lift back to Central City.

724
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:32,416
Central City.

725
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:33,835
What?

726
00:34:33,837 --> 00:34:35,753
You need to check Central
City for the staff.

727
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:37,054
Kendra, you said you were drawn there.

728
00:34:37,056 --> 00:34:38,723
Yeah.

729
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:40,091
I think you're drawn to
things that destroy you

730
00:34:40,093 --> 00:34:41,342
the same way you two
are drawn to each other.

731
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:42,510
That's why it wasn't

732
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:43,928
in any museum or private collection,

733
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,346
because it was consecrated eight months ago

734
00:34:45,348 --> 00:34:46,848
at St. Mark's in Central City.

735
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,483
We've got to get it before Savage does.

736
00:34:48,485 --> 00:34:51,352
- Carter, stay here.
- I'm not going anywhere.

737
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:52,770
Call Thea and Digg,

738
00:34:52,772 --> 00:34:53,988
and we'll have them hold down the fort

739
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,323
in case Savage shows up.

740
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:57,408
Kendra, last year, I lost my powers.

741
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,160
The only way I could get them back

742
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:01,412
is if I just forgot about
everything happening around me

743
00:35:01,414 --> 00:35:03,197
and focused on who I was.

744
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,817
Just believe in yourself, and
your true self will emerge.

745
00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:08,252
Thanks.

746
00:35:08,254 --> 00:35:11,289
Hey, are you sure that you want to do this?

747
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:13,007
If this guy's immortal

748
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:16,844
and Merlyn's right about
how powerful this staff is...

749
00:35:16,846 --> 00:35:18,346
We'll be fine.

750
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:19,680
Kiss her.

751
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:21,766
We'll be fine.

752
00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:26,270
- Careful.
- Let's go.

753
00:35:41,093 --> 00:35:42,477
Now what?

754
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,839
His systolic pressure's dropping.
He's gonna code.

755
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:47,899
How bad is it?

756
00:35:47,901 --> 00:35:50,151
There's a bullet in his pulmonary artery.

757
00:35:50,153 --> 00:35:52,320
Can you close the wound if I get it?

758
00:35:52,322 --> 00:35:54,539
- Yes.
- How are you going to do that?

759
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:58,376
What is that?

760
00:35:58,378 --> 00:35:59,878
It's a serum called Velocity-6.

761
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,463
It could give Jay temporary speed.

762
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:02,881
He can phase through Doctor Wells' chest

763
00:36:02,883 --> 00:36:04,132
and remove the bullet.

764
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,500
Yeah, but I told you, I have no idea

765
00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:06,584
what's gonna happen if I use that.

766
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,052
It's our only option.

767
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:09,838
If you don't do this, Dr. Wells will die.

768
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:23,935
It's working.

769
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,001
BP and oxygenation is rising.

770
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:43,371
Blood flow's returning to his lungs.

771
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:46,090
Thank you.

772
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,395
I was just thinking...

773
00:36:50,397 --> 00:36:54,732
all the moments of my
life when I felt different,

774
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:58,937
like something was wrong with me.

775
00:36:58,939 --> 00:37:02,106
Now I know why.

776
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:05,109
It's gonna be all right.

777
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:07,028
Okay?

778
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,981
Look, I... I know what
it's like to have your life

779
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:12,450
suddenly change like this.

780
00:37:12,452 --> 00:37:15,036
I... I can help you get through this.

781
00:37:15,038 --> 00:37:18,022
I don't know if you can.

782
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:21,876
Cisco, there's a whole
other life inside me,

783
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:25,997
hundreds of lives, that
I need to know about.

784
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:30,301
I think I need to do it by myself.

785
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:32,337
I have to...

786
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:35,039
embrace my destiny.

787
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:38,343
I have to believe.

788
00:37:41,565 --> 00:37:43,648
You don't have to do this.

789
00:37:50,023 --> 00:37:51,889
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

790
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:54,275
I just like to speed into rooms, usually.

791
00:37:54,277 --> 00:37:56,744
Uh-huh. Where do you
think we find this thing?

792
00:37:56,746 --> 00:37:59,247
I haven't been in one of
these places in a while.

793
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:04,202
We're too late.

794
00:38:04,204 --> 00:38:06,704
Something you're not
used to saying very often,

795
00:38:06,706 --> 00:38:08,673
I'd imagine.

796
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:11,426
You tried those arrows
once before, remember?

797
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:14,095
They didn't quite finish
the job, now, did they?

798
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:15,880
I'm not gonna make that mistake again.

799
00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:17,348
You're gonna leave Kendra alone.

800
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,633
I can't do that.

801
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:20,751
While my destiny is to live forever,

802
00:38:20,753 --> 00:38:24,255
Chay-Ara's is to die, as is yours now.

803
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:40,038
- Any ideas?
- Oh, now you'll listen to me?

804
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
It's your city.

805
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:48,413
All right, let's just try to get the staff.

806
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:51,115
- All right, on my mark.
- All right.

807
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,421
Carter was right.

808
00:38:56,423 --> 00:38:57,889
Something's holding me back.

809
00:38:57,891 --> 00:38:59,974
Maybe it's Central City or you

810
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:01,926
or what I thought my life was gonna be,

811
00:39:01,928 --> 00:39:04,962
but I'm never gonna become who
I really am unless I let go.

812
00:39:04,964 --> 00:39:06,147
I have to do this.

813
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:17,408
In all my countless years,

814
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,862
I've never encountered
anybody with your capabilities.

815
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:23,481
Astonishing!

816
00:39:23,483 --> 00:39:25,483
No!

817
00:39:33,593 --> 00:39:35,710
Chay-Ara.

818
00:39:35,712 --> 00:39:37,428
Oh, my God!

819
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:40,665
Whoo-hoo!

820
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,500
I used to enjoy slow deaths.

821
00:39:42,502 --> 00:39:45,637
Now I just find them boring.

822
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:57,615
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

823
00:39:57,617 --> 00:39:59,283
Any chance he blew himself up in there?

824
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:00,485
Not likely.

825
00:40:00,487 --> 00:40:02,286
So that's, like, a tie, right?

826
00:40:02,288 --> 00:40:05,206
- I guess.
- I will take it.

827
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:06,208
Whoo!

828
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:20,888
Hey.

829
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,507
You okay?

830
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:26,310
I'm gonna have to learn
how to use these things.

831
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:29,347
You'll get the hang of it, Hawkgirl.

832
00:40:36,406 --> 00:40:38,406
Dr. Wells?

833
00:40:38,408 --> 00:40:41,892
You're gonna be okay.

834
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:43,778
That's good news.

835
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,749
You will probably be very sore
for a little while, though.

836
00:40:47,751 --> 00:40:50,418
Sore is better than dead.

837
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,537
Yes, it is.

838
00:40:57,342 --> 00:40:59,844
How are you doing, Garrick?

839
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:02,296
Your serum's out of my system,

840
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:05,600
and I will never take it again.

841
00:41:10,556 --> 00:41:14,142
Jay...

842
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:15,893
thank you.

843
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:20,114
You can thank me by keeping
that Velocity-6 away from Barry.

844
00:41:29,374 --> 00:41:30,875
That was Oliver.

845
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:32,410
Savage has the Staff of Horus.

846
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:35,129
He wants us all in Central
City as soon as possible.

847
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:37,331
Okay, well, Laurel's already
there visiting her mom,

848
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,217
so I'll call her and let
her know we're coming by.

849
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:40,951
If Savage is in Central City,

850
00:41:40,953 --> 00:41:42,587
then why are we going back there?

851
00:41:42,589 --> 00:41:44,005
So we can end this.

852
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,306
And if anybody's gonna take down Savage,

853
00:41:45,308 --> 00:41:46,424
it's going to be Barry and Oliver.

854
00:41:46,426 --> 00:41:47,809
Plus, you've emerged.

855
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:48,793
It's going to be much harder for him now.

856
00:41:48,795 --> 00:41:50,144
And together, all of us,

857
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:51,629
we can take him down once and for all.

858
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:55,233
Okay, so how are we gonna get there?

859
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:56,567
Did I mention I'm the CEO

860
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:59,237
of a big company with a private jet?

861
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:11,649
Since when is that a thing?

862
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:13,951
About eight months.

863
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:17,205
Maybe if you save Star
City, you might get one too.

864
00:42:17,207 --> 00:42:20,658
By the way, we still need to get Savage.

865
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,843
We'll get him.

866
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:26,597
Watch yourself, buddy.

867
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:31,803
You don't want to lose this guy.

868
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:33,337
- Thanks, Mister.
- Yeah.
