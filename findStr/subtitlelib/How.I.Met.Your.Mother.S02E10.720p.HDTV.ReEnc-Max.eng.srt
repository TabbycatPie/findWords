1
00:00:00,743 --> 00:00:02,613
Kids, there's nothing
more wonderful

2
00:00:02,619 --> 00:00:04,399
than New York City
in the winter...

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,590
except the view of New
York City in the winter

4
00:00:06,597 --> 00:00:08,457
through your apartment window.

5
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:11,393
In the winter of 2006,
Marshall, Lily, Robin and I

6
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:13,992
were all deep in couple
hibernation mode.

7
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:16,699
Sadly, this left Uncle
Barney out in the cold.

8
00:00:16,705 --> 00:00:18,885
Okay. All-night rave,

9
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,745
abandoned tire
factory in Newark.

10
00:00:20,762 --> 00:00:22,522
We're on the list. Who's in?

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,250
- Nope.
- No.

12
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:30,208
Private jet. Teeterboro Airport,
skinny-skydiving. Who's in?

13
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:31,688
- Nope.
- No, thanks.

14
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:38,539
One beer. Bar, downstairs,
15 second walk. Who's in?

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,030
Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye.

16
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:47,016
It got so bad,
Barney tried to be his own wingman.

17
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:49,411
Hi. Have you met me?

18
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:54,055
Finally, he decided to
bring in reinforcements.

19
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:55,507
- No.
- No.

20
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:58,269
Yes. And do you know why?

21
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:01,835
Hang on to your bedsores,
grandparents from Willy Wonka,

22
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:05,077
because guess who's on his way
up to this apartment right now?

23
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:07,912
My... wait for it...

24
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:10,525
brother, James. React.

25
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:11,706
- Hey!
- Hey!

26
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,209
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:17,431
He's the "awesome-est," most best
"looking-est," greatest guy ever.

28
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,376
He's exactly like Barney.

29
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:20,918
That's what I just said.

30
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:24,319
Well, Barney and his brother
aren't exactly alike.

31
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,821
James is gay.

32
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:27,753
Really? I never in
a million years

33
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:30,406
would I picture you with a gay brother,
that's awesome.

34
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,149
Yeah. I just wanted
you to have a heads up,

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,610
so you don't act all
surprised when he gets here.

36
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,314
Here he is.

37
00:01:38,468 --> 00:01:40,258
What up, New York.

38
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:44,383
Thanks for the heads up.

39
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,418
Sync by vNaru

40
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:02,812
How in God's name did it never come up
that Barney has a gay, black brother?

41
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:04,406
Is he black?

42
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:07,225
I guess I'm the kind of person that
focuses on who people are on the inside

43
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,589
rather than the
color of their skin.

44
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,582
I'm kidding,
I just wanted to see your face.

45
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,888
Yeah, so now the
wedding's back on.

46
00:02:14,898 --> 00:02:16,618
Anyway, James,
how have you been?

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,140
Awesome, as per "yoozh."

48
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:21,124
I just went
skinny-skydiving. Legendary.

49
00:02:21,135 --> 00:02:23,925
And my laser tag team,
just made it to regional finals.

50
00:02:23,948 --> 00:02:25,688
"Legendarier."

51
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,701
And by now you've
noticed the suit--

52
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,762
go 'head, touch it.

53
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,443
Handcrafted by
Pietro Dellacamera,

54
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:35,268
Milan's famous
101-year-old tailor

55
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,571
who upon completing
the very last stitch

56
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,593
in this suit dropped dead,

57
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:42,625
which is ironic because that
is how gorgeous I look in it.

58
00:02:42,638 --> 00:02:43,868
C'mon.

59
00:02:48,766 --> 00:02:49,986
Gimme five.

60
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:51,618
Is "gimme five" back?

61
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,019
Oh, yeah.
I put it in my blog this morning.

62
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,574
Guys, "gimme five" is back!

63
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:58,687
Oh, James,
this is my girlfriend, Robin.

64
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:01,108
- Hey. It's so nice to meet you.
- You, too.

65
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:03,908
So, I have to ask,
there's a story here.

66
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,695
Please.

67
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,746
The truth is,
Barney and James got a lot of...

68
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,139
different explanations from
their mom over the years.

69
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:13,322
Well, boys, you look different

70
00:03:13,335 --> 00:03:15,355
because when I was
pregnant with you,

71
00:03:15,376 --> 00:03:17,586
I only ate vanilla ice cream.

72
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,579
And when I was
pregnant with you,

73
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,721
can you guess what kind
of ice cream I ate?

74
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:23,803
- Coffee?
- No, James,

75
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:26,126
I ate chocolate ice cream.

76
00:03:26,146 --> 00:03:29,936
But I did drink tons of coffee when
I was pregnant with both of you.

77
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:32,092
Can't smoke without my coffee.

78
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,896
I don't know, boys,
I guess it's just one of those things.

79
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:39,291
Stop asking me!

80
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,182
You know what you two are?
You're little racists!

81
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,134
So what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

82
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:45,698
I'll tell you what
James is gonna do.

83
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:47,721
He's gonna do the job
you've been neglecting.

84
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,620
And, as always, he'll do it a
lot better than you ever did.

85
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:52,914
Ted...

86
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:56,038
James is my wingman now.

87
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:57,971
Okay.

88
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:02,244
Last time James was in town,
Barney got slapped once,

89
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:03,916
lucky twice, and...

90
00:04:03,938 --> 00:04:05,778
whose penthouse hot
tub did you end up in?

91
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,160
Ah, public figure,
confidentiality agreement.

92
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,484
But I will say this:

93
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:11,124
way more back hair than any guy

94
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,289
who can afford laser hair
removal should have.

95
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:18,432
And then there was the time they
scored the brother/sister combo.

96
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:20,026
It was everything
we ever dreamed of

97
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:21,869
when watching Donnie and Marie.

98
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,769
She was a little bit country.

99
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:26,551
He was a little bit
way into black guys.

100
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:30,023
Yeah, Barney and James together
was a lethal combination.

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,440
Since there was never
any crossover in targets,

102
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:35,561
James was always there for
Barney with the assist.

103
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:42,089
Whoa. Your scarf...

104
00:04:42,103 --> 00:04:44,013
it is fierce!

105
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,603
Thanks. H & M.

106
00:04:45,616 --> 00:04:47,116
What? I would never know,

107
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:51,499
'cause it is so hot that my eyes
are melting. Oh, I can't see.

108
00:04:51,822 --> 00:04:54,082
Hey! You know,
speaking of things

109
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,875
that would look good
wrapped around you,

110
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:58,316
have you met my straight
brother, Barney?

111
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:02,799
Oh, he is fab--
don't you go nowhere-- "ulous." Okay?

112
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,285
And Barney always
returned the favor.

113
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:06,848
Help, I don't think
he's breathing.

114
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,590
Does anyone
know mouth-to-mouth?

115
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,592
Oh, my God, I do!

116
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:13,445
Okay, great.
How 'bout you instead?

117
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,507
Oh, man,
I am so excited that you're here!

118
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:18,641
It has been forever since
I have been around anyone

119
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,302
even remotely fun.

120
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,254
Uh, yes offense.

121
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,986
You guys are still going
out with us tonight, right?

122
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,610
- No.
- Jammies.

123
00:05:26,623 --> 00:05:28,983
Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...

124
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:31,012
I have warm soup belly.

125
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:34,016
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys...

126
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,809
you are young,
attractive people here

127
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,301
in the greatest city on earth.

128
00:05:39,316 --> 00:05:40,766
There are boys and girls

129
00:05:40,788 --> 00:05:43,538
in Nobody Cares, Wyoming,
wishing they could be here.

130
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:46,841
But instead, they are in someone's
basement drinking bad malt liquor,

131
00:05:46,852 --> 00:05:49,552
debating whether or not they're
going to spend their Saturday night

132
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,078
in the parking lot
of the feed store

133
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,389
or in some other
dude's basement.

134
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,861
You owe it to them to rise up

135
00:05:55,957 --> 00:05:58,237
and shimmy your lazy
asses into something hot,

136
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:01,423
and you go out there and
you live their dream!

137
00:06:01,434 --> 00:06:03,194
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

138
00:06:03,327 --> 00:06:05,767
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"?
- Hell, yeah!

139
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,451
- Can I get a "woo-woo"?
- Woo-woo!

140
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:10,603
Go do it for Wyoming! Yes!

141
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,376
Testify!

142
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,579
So that night,
Barney got his wish.

143
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,731
We all went out.

144
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,240
Daddy's home!

145
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:19,861
Yeah.

146
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:24,208
All right, bro.
What do you like?

147
00:06:24,226 --> 00:06:26,396
Guy in super tight black T?

148
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:28,085
Super tight black guy?

149
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:29,676
Guy who looks like Mr. T?

150
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:33,047
Mmm, yes, yes, and...
talk to me after two martinis.

151
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:35,111
Let's focus on you, my man.

152
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:37,203
I'm feeling lazy.

153
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:38,915
How 'bout girl with
the chocolatini?

154
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:41,867
Oh... boom, back tattoo.

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,590
Hero and the pig?

156
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,511
- Let's ride.
- Fo' 'sho.

157
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:50,717
Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!

158
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:52,391
- Get off me, you pig!
- Hey! Hey!

159
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,582
Her body art is not an
invitation to grope her,

160
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:56,684
it's an expression
of her inner self.

161
00:06:56,696 --> 00:07:00,726
I'm sure, in many ways,
she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.

162
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,261
- What? What?
- What? What?

163
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:04,004
Cool.

164
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:07,917
Let me know if he
bothers you again.

165
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,460
Thanks. You should stay close...
just in case.

166
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:14,361
Sure. If it'll make
you feel safer.

167
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:15,868
I'm Barney.

168
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:19,348
Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy,
crowded bar,

169
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:22,232
you can always tell the
difference between the singles

170
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:23,814
and the couples.

171
00:07:23,827 --> 00:07:26,187
You just have to
look for the signs.

172
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:28,008
- Break.
- Boiling hot.

173
00:07:28,023 --> 00:07:30,283
Singles stay on their
feet for maneuverability.

174
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:31,735
- Hey!
- Hi, how are ya?

175
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:34,486
Have you met my brother?

176
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:37,440
Oh, hello. Have a drink.

177
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,130
Nice to meet ya.

178
00:07:41,566 --> 00:07:44,616
Couples, exhausted by the
sheer act of leaving the house,

179
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,049
are obsessed with finding
a place to sit down.

180
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,244
There are a lot of
other indicators, too.

181
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,424
From choice of
social lubricant...

182
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,252
...to basic body language.

183
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,982
But the point is,
there are many ways to tell

184
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:01,107
whether someone
has Single Stamina

185
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:02,556
or Couples Coma.

186
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,151
I wish I would've
worn sneakers.

187
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:07,002
I just got finished running
from some fat, hairy guy

188
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:09,465
who was periscoping out
of his pleather pants.

189
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:12,018
Permission to come
aboard denied.

190
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:13,991
I miss my jammies.

191
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:16,303
I can't believe I
wore a bra for this.

192
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:19,303
Bras suck.
They're so confining and unnatural.

193
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:21,506
Yeah, they're like
a boobie zoo.

194
00:08:21,522 --> 00:08:24,072
Well, why don't you take it off
then and let those puppies breathe?

195
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,205
Oh, please go sweat
on someone else.

196
00:08:27,046 --> 00:08:28,396
Poor guy.

197
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,749
Poor guy? Poor my boobs.

198
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:32,669
Well, it takes a lot of
guts to approach a girl

199
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,183
and you just crushed him.

200
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:37,544
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He looks all broken up inside.

201
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:39,358
Whatever, you guys have
no idea what it's like

202
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,959
to be on the receiving end.

203
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,500
"Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl

204
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:46,487
and everybody everywhere
wants to buy me drinks

205
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:48,068
and have sex with me."

206
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:48,961
Waa.

207
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:51,851
"Oh, poor me.
I get to order yummy, pink drinks

208
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,895
with chunks of real fruit
that guys secretly like,

209
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:55,675
but can't order because
they'll be made fun of."

210
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,370
- Dude.
- They're delicious!

211
00:08:58,243 --> 00:09:00,913
Excuse me. Join me in a shot?

212
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:02,826
Oh, no thanks. I've had enough.

213
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:07,751
He's too in shape,

214
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:10,823
we'd spend all night talking
about his body fat content.

215
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,667
Now, if you'll excuse me,

216
00:09:12,688 --> 00:09:15,878
I'm gonna go have a yummy,
pink drink with fruit in it...

217
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:17,591
because I can.

218
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:21,315
You know, that was,
like, the third hot guy

219
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:23,039
that James blew off tonight.

220
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:25,473
Yeah, he's turning down shots,
he's yawning,

221
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:27,225
he's whining about his feet.

222
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:28,986
He's as bad as we are.

223
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:30,188
He is.

224
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:33,848
Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are.
You guys don't think that James is...

225
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:35,233
in a relationship?

226
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:37,934
No. There's no way.
He's Barney's brother.

227
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:39,508
Look at that.

228
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
He's texting!

229
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,714
Oh, my God!

230
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,405
He is in a couple.

231
00:09:46,428 --> 00:09:48,428
This is gonna kill Barney.

232
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:49,948
What's gonna kill me?

233
00:09:50,152 --> 00:09:51,772
What's going on?

234
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:53,743
B-Barney?

235
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:58,016
Have you noticed anything...
different about James?

236
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,089
No.

237
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,260
I mean, he's glowing from his peel,
if that's what you mean.

238
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,546
We have reason to believe
that James is, uh,

239
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,071
maybe hiding
something from you.

240
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,420
I-I know you're not gonna
like hearing this, but...

241
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,873
Barney...

242
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:14,084
your brother is...

243
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,698
monogamous.

244
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:20,003
That's ridiculous!

245
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,604
Just because he's
a little sleepy,

246
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,828
and he hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall...

247
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:31,171
He hasn't had sex with
anyone in a bathroom stall.

248
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:33,498
And, Barney...

249
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:36,341
I hate to be the one to
tell you this, but...

250
00:10:37,274 --> 00:10:38,794
he's texting.

251
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,135
No, he... No!

252
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,630
That... is impossible.

253
00:10:48,576 --> 00:10:51,826
Excuse... Excuse... Ex...

254
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,250
Hey, bro.

255
00:10:54,264 --> 00:10:55,954
Don't change the subject.

256
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,135
Let me see your phone.

257
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:57,897
Why?

258
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,598
I just want to see your phone.
Let me see your phone.

259
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:01,798
No, it's just a phone.
It's just a phone!

260
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,030
And it's got Internet access,
and it's got a camera on it,

261
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:05,785
and you can surf the Web
and do the whole thing.

262
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:08,346
It's so amazing how far
technology has come.

263
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,438
What kind of phone do you have?

264
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,618
I got...

265
00:11:15,606 --> 00:11:16,756
Who is this?

266
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:20,128
And the answer better be:
"I don't remember his name."

267
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,412
That is Tom.

268
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,094
And he's my fiancé.

269
00:11:32,797 --> 00:11:33,857
Hey.

270
00:11:35,453 --> 00:11:37,193
I don't support this.

271
00:11:37,244 --> 00:11:38,344
Gay marriage?

272
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:41,016
Not gay marriage-- marriage!

273
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,638
How can you do this?

274
00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,562
We were raised in the same house,
with the same values!

275
00:11:46,933 --> 00:11:50,013
Believe me,
I fought this for a long time.

276
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,079
Come on, it's embarrassing.

277
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:55,578
Look, this felt unnatural to me,
too, at first.

278
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:57,995
But I fell in love.

279
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:00,635
And Tom and I realized
you can't fight love.

280
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:01,868
Oh, God.

281
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,339
Is that what you two do together?
You sit around the house

282
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:08,064
and talk about love?
I think... I'm gonna be sick.

283
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:09,786
Okay, okay, look,

284
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:11,479
I need you to wrap your
head around this, okay?

285
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:13,443
Because it is happening.

286
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,443
And I want you to
be my best man.

287
00:12:16,457 --> 00:12:19,137
What? No way.

288
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,766
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

289
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,082
I hope you change your mind.

290
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:39,569
Two beers, one shot.

291
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,083
Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.

292
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:48,556
Oh, sweetie!
Did you make that for me?

293
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,400
Yes.

294
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,944
Clam Bake.
Staten Island. Who's in?

295
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:59,518
Okay, I didn't have high
hopes for that one.

296
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:01,423
Okay, here's my thing.

297
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:03,084
If gay guys start
getting married,

298
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:05,397
then suddenly the whole
world's gonna be doing it.

299
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:07,009
That's how it works.
They start something,

300
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:09,729
then six months later,
everyone follows.

301
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:12,314
Like now everyone
gets manicures.

302
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,674
I don't get manicures.

303
00:13:13,688 --> 00:13:16,818
Okay, then like how...
Like getting your chest waxed.

304
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,509
You get your chest waxed?

305
00:13:18,522 --> 00:13:20,252
You know what I mean!

306
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:23,186
Gay marriage is going
to cause single life,

307
00:13:23,207 --> 00:13:25,387
as we know it, to die out.

308
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,859
Think of how the American
family will be strengthened.

309
00:13:28,873 --> 00:13:31,153
Barney, I'm sorry you're upset,
but you got to suck it up

310
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:32,285
and be a man about this.

311
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:33,338
No.

312
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:37,058
It's always been me and him together,
being awesome,

313
00:13:37,074 --> 00:13:39,514
while the rest of
you walked two-by-two

314
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,288
onto your ark of
sexless boredom.

315
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,140
Just because James
is getting married

316
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,950
doesn't mean things
are going to change.

317
00:13:45,963 --> 00:13:49,283
Yeah. Like things haven't
changed with you people.

318
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,629
Look, my sister married
a guy I didn't like.

319
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,060
Sandals and socks--
come on, buddy.

320
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:57,222
But I took her out,
we celebrated.

321
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,587
It was the right thing to do.

322
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,359
You got to support him.

323
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:04,173
You're right, Ted.

324
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:07,023
This is a cause
for celebration.

325
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:10,445
We need to take him out and
celebrate the commitment

326
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:12,762
he and Tom are about to make.

327
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:17,374
Yeah. This is where
we're celebrating

328
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,899
the commitment that Tom
and I are about to make?

329
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,239
What? Yeah!

330
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,461
See, that cage represents
your commitment.

331
00:14:29,753 --> 00:14:33,703
Oh, my God. Freedom
has never tasted so delicious.

332
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:34,966
Hey.

333
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:36,636
You work out?

334
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,080
I do.

335
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,880
And thank you for noticing.

336
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:42,102
You're obviously in very
good shape yourself.

337
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,665
Well, I try.

338
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:45,287
So you want to dance?

339
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:48,008
You know what?
I'm very flattered, and, objectively,

340
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:51,193
you're a very attractive man,
but this is actually my fiancée.

341
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:53,845
I'm sorry.
You know, I saw your drink and I...

342
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,719
No, no, this isn't my drink.
This is hers.

343
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,583
No, it isn't.

344
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,435
Whatever.

345
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:01,764
How 'bout you?

346
00:15:01,778 --> 00:15:03,328
Oh, I'm straight, too.

347
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:05,289
But I thank you for your time,

348
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:08,291
and I appreciate your
interest in my body.

349
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:11,525
You see that?

350
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:13,567
Being hit on doesn't
have to be terrible.

351
00:15:13,592 --> 00:15:16,762
I feel flattered,
and everyone left with their dignity.

352
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:21,077
Hey, I really like
your sweater.

353
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:23,848
Wow. You actually do,
don't you?

354
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,300
You're not checking out
my boobs or anything.

355
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,636
My name's Gay Ken,
what do you think?

356
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:30,996
I love this place! Let's dance!

357
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,660
- And not be groped!
- Whoo! Thank you.

358
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:38,717
- Damn.
- Thank you!

359
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,810
- We're hot.
- Totally.

360
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:44,994
And then Tom says to the dealer

361
00:15:45,006 --> 00:15:48,796
that the handmade Georgian
clock has a chip on the corner.

362
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:51,981
Blam, we get that puppy half price.
What up?!

363
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:53,255
Bam!

364
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:58,026
Sounds like you really rocked
that arts and crafts fair.

365
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,428
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

366
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:02,323
Hey, oh, my God.
This is so liberating,

367
00:16:02,334 --> 00:16:04,514
being able to talk
about this to you.

368
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,107
I cannot wait for
you to meet Tom.

369
00:16:06,127 --> 00:16:08,647
And I cannot wait for you
to meet my good friend...

370
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:10,052
this guy.

371
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:12,463
Excuse me, do you know anyone
who would like to buy

372
00:16:12,474 --> 00:16:15,484
my incredibly muscular, fun,
large-handed brother a drink?

373
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,450
Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you,
Barnaby. Okay.

374
00:16:20,734 --> 00:16:24,614
All right. I spy a group of women
who have let their defenses down

375
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,451
because they are in a gay club.

376
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,040
You see that chick right there?

377
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,475
She looks like she'd fall for
sports agent and football player.

378
00:16:31,495 --> 00:16:32,855
Okay, I'm in.

379
00:16:32,878 --> 00:16:34,398
Which one am I?

380
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,870
Please.

381
00:16:37,754 --> 00:16:40,354
He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil,
and drops his pants

382
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:42,968
after three dirty martinis.
Now go, man, go!

383
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:51,636
I just never thought I'd
see Barney so vulnerable.

384
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:54,408
Well, I guess no one wants to feel like
they're going through the world alone.

385
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,172
Look at me,
in a yummy sandwich!

386
00:16:57,184 --> 00:17:00,324
Okay, we're actually right in the
middle of something right now, so...

387
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:03,191
Ooh, I know what I want to be
in the middle of. Thoughts?

388
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,593
God, can't two straight guys
come to a gay dance club,

389
00:17:05,606 --> 00:17:08,336
enjoy some techno and good
conversation without being bothered?

390
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:14,901
How's it going, guys?
Still enjoying the attentions of men?

391
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,736
That's like the eighth guy
who's hit on us in ten minutes.

392
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:20,217
It's like, hello,
my eyes are up here.

393
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,680
And it's never the hot ones.

394
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:24,011
It's always the losers.
Bums me out!

395
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:26,577
Looks like the boys
learned their lesson.

396
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,208
Do you totally
miss being hit on?

397
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:30,021
Oh, totally.
Let's go find a sports bar.

398
00:17:31,713 --> 00:17:34,493
James, James,
since you like arts and crafts,

399
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:38,116
look at what Charles here
made with cherry stems.

400
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,011
He did it with his tongue.

401
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,215
Yeah.

402
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:41,944
Barney.

403
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:45,234
So, Charles, why don't you put
your number in my brother's phone,

404
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:46,461
and once he's in
a funner mood...

405
00:17:46,492 --> 00:17:48,312
Barney, Barney,
I don't want his number.

406
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:51,133
I don't want anyone's
number, okay?

407
00:17:51,146 --> 00:17:52,636
I'm getting married.

408
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,169
Wow.

409
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:56,347
- Best of luck to you both.
- Thank you.

410
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,931
My number's in here.

411
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,684
I'm very discreet.

412
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:02,788
Okay, okay, excuse me.

413
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,540
Barney, family talk.

414
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,712
Okay, dude,
you have got to stop this, okay?

415
00:18:06,722 --> 00:18:09,672
I know that my getting married is
threatening to your way of life...

416
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:11,205
Oh, so now it's my way of life?

417
00:18:11,227 --> 00:18:13,407
I thought it was
our way of life.

418
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,630
You've completely
turned your back on it.

419
00:18:15,643 --> 00:18:17,353
Look at you,
not even suited up.

420
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,695
Do you remember why
we suit up, James?

421
00:18:19,717 --> 00:18:20,927
To get laid.

422
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,000
To show people that
we are different

423
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:26,439
from the millions of T-shirt
and jeans lemmings out there.

424
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:29,044
The suit shows that we are
a force to be reckoned with,

425
00:18:29,057 --> 00:18:31,587
a two-person army that
plays by its own rules.

426
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,110
But you've taken off the uniform,
you've crossed enemy lines,

427
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,285
and you've abandoned me.

428
00:18:35,306 --> 00:18:36,656
Well, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

429
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:40,356
It's not too late to back out
of this stupid marriage thing!

430
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:42,032
You don't have to do this, bro!

431
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:43,304
- Yes, I do.
- Why?!

432
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:45,923
Because Tom and I are
gonna have a baby.

433
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,968
What? There's gonna be a baby?

434
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,291
Yes. We're adopting.

435
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:56,013
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna be an uncle?

436
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,917
For the rest of your life.

437
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,885
And that's how Barney
became Uncle Barney.

438
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,905
A year later,
at James's wedding,

439
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:07,848
Barney could not have
been more proud.

440
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:09,531
To James and Tom.

441
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,111
May you have a long and
happy life together.

442
00:19:12,126 --> 00:19:15,326
And may I always have the skin
and libido of a much younger man.

443
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:16,919
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

444
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,103
Nice one.

445
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:22,514
Thanks. I decided to leave
out the hetero college phase.

446
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,927
No one wants to
hear about that.

447
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,319
It was perfect.

448
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:27,582
You even made Tom's dad cry.

449
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:30,544
Might have been doing that
because he's a Republican.

450
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,096
Whoa.

451
00:19:33,118 --> 00:19:34,598
It's 9:00.

452
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:37,081
We should be getting back.
You guys want to split a cab?

453
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,982
Uh, no, I think I'm gonna
stay a little bit longer.

454
00:19:39,014 --> 00:19:41,084
Yeah, me, too.
I'm not tired at all.

455
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:43,389
All right, well, it's getting late.
Got to get the wife home.

456
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:45,751
Oh, stop calling me that.
It makes me sound fat.

457
00:19:47,064 --> 00:19:49,584
Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.

458
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:05,755
- May I?
- Yeah.

459
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:13,512
Hey, buddy.

460
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,653
Your parents are married.

461
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:17,555
Now, listen, you.

462
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:20,107
Just because you're being
raised by married people

463
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,629
doesn't mean you have to
choose that lifestyle.

464
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:23,774
High-five.

465
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:26,748
Luckily, you got me.

466
00:20:26,918 --> 00:20:30,428
In 20 and a half years,
you'll be 21,

467
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,291
and I will be...

468
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:35,046
Well, I haven't decided
how old I'll be yet.

469
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:39,416
But we are gonna bro out,
uncle and nephew style.

470
00:20:39,464 --> 00:20:41,104
Stick with me, kid.

471
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,145
I am gonna teach
you how to live.

472
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,309
Great suit, by the way.

473
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,356
Who is the cutest?

474
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,455
I don't get it.

475
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:04,569
Tom liked my breasts
in tenth grade.

476
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,562
Why doesn't he like them now?

477
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:09,814
Why?

478
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:14,057
Rosa, why always be attracted
to the unavailable ones?

479
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:16,342
Why not accept the fact that
you're a beautiful woman

480
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:18,384
who is worthy of love?

481
00:21:18,396 --> 00:21:20,666
Are you brave enough
to hear that?

482
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,910
You...
