00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,126
(HARVEY READING)

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,005
I want you to go back over your work
with a fine-tooth comb.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,645
We're as protected as we can be.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,923
Every partner at this firm goes
over their work if I say so.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,441
I'm not every goddamn partner.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,891
I made a deal with Forstman.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,844
This has got to be the most genius thing
you have ever done

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,884
in your entire, wonderful life.

9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,804
Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,685
- through Switzerland and the Caymans.
- Louis, that's illegal.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,928
You didn't see the look on Harvey's face
when he found out

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,690
that I was the one who saved the day.

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,003
And I am not gonna see the look on
his face when he finds out that I didn't.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,925
There isn't enough money in the world
for me to ever trust you again.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,008
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me!

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,480
You're fired.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,210
- No, I can't.
- Rachel. Rachel!

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,402
- What the hell is this?
- A job offer.

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,964
I am going to tell Mike what happened.

20
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,970
If you do this, you will be risking
your whole life with Mike.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,003
I am risking it if I don't.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,245
What is this pulling
tugging at my

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,570
Limbs so heavy,
dragging me down again

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,246
Into the depths of
cold blue water

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,048
But don't believe me,
I swear this isn't me

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,322
- I heard.
- How?

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,687
- Amy.
- (SIGHS) Why would she say...

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,167
So that you wouldn't have to.
Here.

29
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,809
Shit.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,688
I didn't even think about
what would happen to her.

31
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,451
Mike, you don't have to think about
anyone except for you right now.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,091
I don't want to think about me.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,044
All I've done is let everyone down,
including you.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,964
You have not let me down.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,365
You don't even know what I've done.

36
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,563
- Whatever it is, it can't be as bad as...
- As I think?

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,208
Rachel, I lost my job.

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,611
I lost the takeover.
I lost Walter Gillie his company.

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,530
I cut a deal to sell out the man
who gave me a chance in the first place.

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,087
And to top it all off, the guy who made
me do that called me "his guy"

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,403
and offered me a job.
So, what does that make me?

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,164
It makes you a human being.

43
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,369
Oh my one,
Swear I'm trying

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,330
What good would it do lying?

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,762
Oh my one,
Swear I'm trying

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,002
- I don't know what to do.
- I don't either.

47
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,801
But we don't have
to do anything tonight.

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,091
Louis, you need to calm down.

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,931
- I broke the law.
- Please keep your voice down.

50
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,486
Why? Let any man judge me.
So says the good book.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,931
- No, it doesn't.
- You know what?

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,246
I think I know what
the goddamn good book says.

53
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,210
Listen to me.
You did what you had to do.

54
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,647
Oh, really? Well, that's not what you said
when you found out.

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,091
You said, "Louis, that's illegal."

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,969
Because I was trying to get you
not to go through with it.

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,482
But you made a decision. I understand
why. And now that it's done,

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,171
I'm not going to let you
beat yourself up about it.

59
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,925
Yeah, well, you may not.
But what do you think Harvey

60
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,491
and Jessica are gonna do
when they find out?

61
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,490
Louis, you have been
a hero again and again.

62
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,568
And if the one time
they actually treat you like one

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,445
you crossed a little line to get there,
that doesn't make you horrible.

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,080
It makes you Harvey.

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,084
You know what? You're absolutely right.

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,204
And as of this second, I'm gonna
start acting like the hero that I am.

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,330
Hey, jerk-off. Who do I have to blow
to get some more nuts?

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,809
It turned out he knew
all about the crop report.

69
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,890
So you know what I did? I nailed him
on six counts of mail fraud.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,286
(ALL LAUGHING)

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,527
Did you tell them the one

72
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,961
about how you got your head stuck up
Eric Woodall's ass?

73
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,730
(mum-nus)

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,764
Excuse me, boys.

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,844
What the hell are you doing here?

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,526
You think you're the only person
who can have someone followed?

77
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,881
- You have no right.
- Oh, I have every right.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,525
I just didn't need to hire someone.

79
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,564
Because it turns out, you come
to the same shithole every night,

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,126
telling the same stories
to the same people

81
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,208
because you have no place else to go.

82
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,281
If you're thinking you can bait me
into taking a swing at you,

83
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,367
you might be right.

84
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,041
- Why don't you take a swing at this?
- Oh, you're trying to bribe me now.

85
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,891
That's a certified letter outlining
everything that's happened

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,561
since you started targeting me.
Every bullshit move you've made.

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,808
It's not bullshit.
It's an ongoing investigation.

88
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,208
And it's turned up bullshit,
which I've outlined for Judge Hopkins.

89
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,369
Everything from targeting my clients
to having me followed.

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,450
So, now you have 10 days to dispute
my accounting of events.

91
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,006
And when they're done,
I expect to never see you again.

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,851
You don't know me that well.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,324
Sean, anytime you want to put the badge
down and fight me man to man,

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,764
you know where to find me.

95
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,809
See the money, wanna stay
for your meal

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,606
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

97
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,929
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

98
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,328
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,171
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

100
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,843
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

101
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,726
All right!

102
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,091
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

103
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,284
The greenback boogie

104
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,562
How's the job hunt going?

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,887
- What do you want, Forstman?
- Oh.

106
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,324
Now that you don't want
my money, it's Forstman?

107
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,721
No "mister"?

108
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,802
What happened to the obsequious
little shit who approached me

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,729
in that coffee shop
with his hand out?

110
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,490
He realized that
you don't deserve any respect.

111
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,726
I don't need your respect.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,684
I need an answer on my job offer.

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,165
I thought I was pretty clear.

114
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,451
Your mouth said one thing.
Let's see what your eyes have to say.

115
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,608
- A million dollars. Is this a joke?
- It's your signing bonus.

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,688
Are you ready to come
work for me now?

117
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,761
I thought I was an obsequious little shit.

118
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,731
You are. But so was I
when I was your age.

119
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,171
And look what happened to me.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,731
You can make it 10 million, Charles.

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,082
- I don't want your money.
- I'm not gonna make it 10 million.

122
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,804
The offer is one
and that's where it's staying.

123
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,730
You have a day.

124
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,724
If you decide not to take my offer,

125
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,687
I will know you're not only an asshole,
you're a fool.

126
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,726
Let's go.

127
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,684
Jessica. To what do I owe the honor?
What can I do for you?

128
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,410
Louis, I am coming to you

129
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,241
because the question isn't what you can
do for me, but what can I do for you.

130
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,684
Harvey and I were very impressed
by what you did with Charles Forstman.

131
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,008
I'm impressed that you understand
how impressive it was.

132
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,727
And since we couldn't figure out how
best to show our gratitude,

133
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,601
I'm here to ask you what you would like.

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,531
I'm sorry. Um.
(CLEARS THROAT)

135
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,130
- You want to give me...
- A reward.

136
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,691
- Anything I want?
- All you have to do is ask...

137
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,370
Pearson Specter Litt.

138
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,211
- Excuse me?
- I think I was clear.

139
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,651
I want my name on the door.
It can go third.

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
Louis, name partner isn't
something I can just hand out.

141
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,847
- But you just said I saved the day.
- You just said you saved the day.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,684
I said we wanted
to show our gratitude.

143
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,410
By telling me I get to choose
whatever I want,

144
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,090
except for the one thing I really want.

145
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,281
Maybe I should have been more clear.

146
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,971
Maybe you should have. I mean,
you're a goddamn lawyer, after all.

147
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,885
Louis, then let me be clear right now.

148
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,328
I am giving you an opportunity

149
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,600
to accept a well deserved
thank you with grace.

150
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,722
You can either take it,
or you can turn it into a personal snub

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,723
and ruin all the goodwill that you've
just earned with me and Harvey.

152
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,450
The choice is yours.

153
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,484
- Can I get back to you on that?
- I'm sorry, what?

154
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,011
Can I get back to you on that?

155
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,649
That's all I can hope for, Louis.

156
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,690
Hey. So, I just wanted to run
through your schedule

157
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,007
- for the rest of the week.
- Go ahead.

158
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,886
You've got Ellis at 4:00 today,
McKinney at 10:00 tomorrow,

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,483
Chamberlin at 2:00, and when should
I pencil you in to go see Mike?

160
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,921
- See him for what?
- To be a friend.

161
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,209
Donna, as far as he's concerned
I sold him out to win the takeover.

162
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,084
I am the last person
he wants to see right now.

163
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,289
And I would agree with all of that
except for that fact that Mike got fired.

164
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,568
- What? When?
- Last night.

165
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,762
And I wasn't gonna tell you because
you should be hearing it from him.

166
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,651
But men are idiots and they
would rather be alone and miserable

167
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,240
than ever run the risk
of being accused of needing someone.

168
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,521
He has Rachel.

169
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,371
Who is the one person Mike believes
will stand by him no matter what.

170
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,006
Which makes her the one person

171
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,090
he won't believe when she says
he didn't completely fail.

172
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,649
How important is
the meeting with Ellis?

173
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,844
- He says it's urgent.
- Tell him I have to reschedule.

174
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,002
That's weird. I already did.

175
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,081
Rachel or Donna?

176
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,291
Who told you to check up on me?

177
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,807
- You don't think I'd do that on my own?
- No, I don't.

178
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,487
Well, I wouldn't have,
because I didn't think you'd need it.

179
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,125
Then I found out that you got fired.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,402
So what? People lose theirjobs
every single day.

181
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,809
Yeah, not people like you. Something's
going on. Why did you get fired?

182
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,366
You mean, other than the fact
that I picked a fight I couldn't win?

183
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,167
I don't care how it turned out.
You went 15 rounds on your first shot.

184
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,011
No way Jonathan Sidwell
lets you go after that.

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,490
It was Forstman, wasn't it?

186
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,287
I only got his money if I agreed
to cut Sidwell out of the deal.

187
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,810
And Sidwell found out.

188
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,285
He didn't just find out.
Forstman told him.

189
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,640
That son of a bitch.

190
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,730
Yeah, there's more.
That son of a bitch has offered me a job.

191
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,845
- Mike, you can't do it and you know it.
- What choice do I have?

192
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,170
I was an investment banker
for 10 minutes

193
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,487
and I blew the only deal
I'm ever going to get near.

194
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,841
Well, that sounds
exactly like the kind of bullshit

195
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,201
Forstman tells people
to wrap them around his finger.

196
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,084
- That doesn't mean it's not true.
- Yes, it does.

197
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,407
I can get you five interviews
before tomorrow.

198
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,609
- And how are you gonna do that?
- By making five goddamn phone calls.

199
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,007
And what are you gonna say
when they answer?

200
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,885
You gonna tell them I was a Harvard
educated lawyer working for you?

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,765
Because you do that,
I might as well go back to being a fraud.

202
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,640
What if I can get Jessica
to take you back?

203
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,603
What... What if you could bring
my parents back to life?

204
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,451
Because both of those things have about
the same chance of happening.

205
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,324
- Mike, I'm trying to help you.
- And I appreciate that.

206
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,488
But I only have two references, Harvey.

207
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,886
You, who has to lie for me,

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,207
- and Jonathan, who wants to kill me.
- Mike...

209
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,924
Harvey, it's enough.

210
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,251
As much as you want to help me,

211
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,887
you have no idea what it is
to have been a fraud

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,482
- and have to start all over.
- I don't.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,411
But someone else does.

214
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,770
Well, well.

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,884
If it isn't employee number 7611053.

216
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,682
- You still remember that.
- I may have lied on my resume.

217
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,802
I never lied about
having a head for numbers.

218
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,007
And I never said how sorry I was
for what happened to you.

219
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,604
You don't need to be sorry, Mike.
The truth is, I should be thanking you.

220
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,290
- What?
- You know what I do now?

221
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,924
- Statistical analysis for fantasy baseball.
- (LAUGHS) That's awesome.

222
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,041
You don't know the half of it.

223
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,164
In my old "better" job,
I sat in my office,

224
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,404
crunched my numbers,
made a lot more money,

225
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,841
and barely knew the name
of one person on my floor.

226
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,611
Now my best friends are
the people I work with.

227
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,881
(CHUCKLES)

228
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,283
Well. Why did you call me?

229
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,488
The last time I saw you,
you had no idea

230
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,762
what you were gonna do
with the rest of your life.

231
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,930
You had to completely start over.

232
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,401
- And it looks like you did. I guess I...
- Want to know how.

233
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,924
- You start by starting.
- What does that mean?

234
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,727
It means for six months,
I threw myself a giant pity party

235
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,248
and wondered how the hell I was going
to get out of the mess I was in.

236
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,208
And then, one day
I said enough is enough.

237
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,927
And instead of asking questions,
I started looking for answers.

238
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,965
And you found fantasy baseball.

239
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,287
No, I found out
that how much money you make

240
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,641
is not the most important thing
in the world.

241
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,922
Who you spend it with every day is.

242
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,363
- Thanks, Stan. I appreciate it.
- Whoa, Mike.

243
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,966
Why exactly is it
you need to start over?

244
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,482
(CHUCKLES)
It's a long story.

245
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,446
- I have time.
- Another day, Stan.

246
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,885
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

247
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,651
- Clear your schedule tonight.
- Done. Why?

248
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,804
Jessica offered me anything I want
as a reward for my heroism

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,161
and we're gonna
figure out what that is.

250
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,926
- What's to figure out? Name partner.
- No, not that.

251
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,602
Anything but that.

252
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,881
What do you mean,
"Anything but that"?

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,490
There isn't anything but that.

254
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,886
Oh, you think I didn't ask for it?

255
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,287
The words were out of my mouth faster
than Esther when she was 13.

256
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,890
Louis, I don't care
about your slutty sister.

257
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,201
You deserve name partner.

258
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,687
And I don't care that you don't care,
because it's not gonna happen.

259
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,169
Now, we were given a chance
to take the high road.

260
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,811
And that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

261
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,049
If I were ever going to be attracted
to you, now would be the time.

262
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,527
Instead, I'll prepare a list of demands
befitting a hero.

263
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,126
Good. And don't ever talk about
being attracted to me again.

264
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,685
It weirds me out.

265
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,206
- The answer's no.
- You don't even know what I'm here for.

266
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,885
I know what you're not here for.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,889
To tell me after a long night
of soul searching,

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,401
you've decided to give me full control
of Gillie Industries.

269
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,922
You're right, I'm not. But I am here
to give you full control of this.

270
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,608
- This isn't public information.
- It will be in 24 hours.

271
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,120
So, it's legal to give it to you.

272
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,483
And it gives me a 24-hour edge
if I decide to act on this information.

273
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,605
Which, as you can see from that filing,
would be a very profitable thing to do.

274
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,882
And all I have to do in return
is use your law firm?

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,889
I don't care what law firm you use.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,082
I just want you to have
Mike Ross run point on the deal.

277
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,726
Then we're back where we started and
you can get the hell out of my office.

278
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,481
Jonathan, I know what he did.
But he thought he had no choice.

279
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,290
When a person thinks he has no choice
is when you see his true character.

280
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,723
And you think you have no choice
other than to be vindictive right now.

281
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,683
This isn't vindictive, it's common sense.

282
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,924
And where I come from, you don't give
the fox another run at the henhouse.

283
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,088
You wouldn't have even had
a shot at the henhouse

284
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,441
if it wasn't for him getting you out
from under Tony Gianopolous.

285
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,891
And I repaid him for that

286
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,923
by giving him his first shot
at investment banking.

287
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,044
And where I come from,
the way you really repay someone

288
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,322
is by giving them
a second goddamn shot.

289
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,363
Then go the hell back
to where you came from.

290
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,204
And hey. If you think he's so great,
take him back there with you.

291
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,530
Louis, do you have a minute?

292
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,450
Not really. I'm in the middle
of some very important gift choosing.

293
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,002
- What?
- Yeah, wouldn't you like to know?

294
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,930
But you never will
because a person only gets gifts

295
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,929
when they fix the mistakes
that Jeff Malone's made.

296
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,690
Actually, Louis, that's why I'm here.

297
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,047
I wanted to thank you for catching
that error on the Wexler stock.

298
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,849
- You want to thank me?
- Yes, Louis, I do.

299
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,884
Look. I know you don't trust me.

300
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,249
But you got us out of a jam and
I'm here to thank you, man to man.

301
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,522
Bullshit.
You're here to kiss my ass

302
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,688
because you found out that I'm now
above you in the pecking order.

303
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,928
Louis, I don't care
about the pecking order.

304
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,407
And all I found out
is that you fixed this thing for Harvey,

305
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,409
and I am here to thank you.

306
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,931
I'm not talking about Harvey
and you know it.

307
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,883
- No, Louis.
- Don't play dumb with me.

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,570
I'm talking about Jessica Pearson.

309
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,603
The woman whose ass
you've really been kissing.

310
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,930
The very same woman who came to me
and asked me to check your work.

311
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,241
Yeah. Uh-huh.

312
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,087
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
some Lipizzaner stallions to look at.

313
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,483
You had Louis Litt check my work?

314
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,568
I was wondering
when we might get into this.

315
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,762
Well, the wondering is over
because it's now.

316
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,121
And if you were gonna do something
like that, you should have discussed it

317
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,481
with me first
before going behind my back.

318
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,726
I did discuss it with you,

319
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,411
and you stood right there
and said your work was perfect

320
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,646
and I should trust you.

321
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,604
You see, that's the problem right there.
You don't trust me.

322
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,848
And now you're just rubbing
my mistake in my face.

323
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,522
If the goal was to rub it in your face,

324
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,325
I would have done that already and
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

325
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,044
In that case, maybe we should
keep our conversations

326
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,889
on a professional level for a while.

327
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,845
You were the one
who wanted to do both.

328
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,564
And maybe I was wrong.

329
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,646
I never said I didn't trust you.

330
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,881
I said I didn't trust your work on Wexler.

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,321
That's the difference between us,
Jessica.

332
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,881
You see, when I say trust me,
I mean trust the man

333
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,885
who works for you
and the man that's with you.

334
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,005
You wanted to see me?

335
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,243
- You don't seem in a good mood.
- I'm not.

336
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,566
We can talk about it later.

337
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,126
I walked all the way down here.
We can talk about it now.

338
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,489
Well, I was just going to ask
how Louis' talk went.

339
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,127
Bullshit. That is not an "I have to come
talk to you," conversation.

340
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,164
I want to bring Mike back.

I ever want to have.

- Harvey.

I haven't slept better since his last night,
except for every night since.

345
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,691
And I am not going back.

346
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,448
And in case you really were wondering,
Louis took his thank you like a dick.

347
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,603
And if that's all, I'm going home.

and I make it awesome.

that his spaghetti sauce...

Oh, my God.
That's amazing.

Not every single guy
was raised by his grandmother.

355
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,447
Mmm. Now, you sit down, shut up,
and tell me about your day.

356
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,523
- What got you in such a good mood?
- Oh, you know, nothing.

357
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,769
Just spent the afternoon figuring out
what I'm gonna do with my life.

358
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,011
Well, that sounds like quite
the afternoon. What did you figure out?

359
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,729
Well, I figured out I don't want
to take the job with Forstman.

360
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,004
And I don't want to be
an investment banker.

361
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,770
So, what do you want to be?

362
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,761
I don't know.

363
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,691
But I know I want to be with you.

364
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,326
- What are you saying?
- I want to start over.

366
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,208
Rachel, when I met you,
I had nothing in my life

367
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,527
except what came from being a fraud.

368
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,286
And nowl have nothing in it
except being with you.

369
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,482

it won't be to tell me to stay away.

she loved it.

- You don't know that he won't.
- You don't know that he will.

this will bore a hole in his head.

to find a way to trust him with the truth.

Of course you can.

- I'm not saying you have to.

stuck it in your face like that?

to get in my head.

that's all it is?

did it to you before and I let him

gonna let him do it to you now.

come of that?

I need to know
that I can trust you.

it didn't mean anything, but he said...

- Mike, please.
- Did it mean something or not?

Okay. Look.

00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,881
Okay. I made a huge mistake.
But you just asked if you could trust me.

You didn't tell me about this for a week.

you lied.

446

before I could tell you the whole story.

The whole story?

448
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,924
There's no way you were gonna
tell me that whole story.

- He said that you loved it!

what I do next because I have you,

- You and Sheila loved each other.

neither of you had done anything wrong.

I did something wrong.

And now he doesn't trust me. And
I can't make him trust me or forgive me.

474

I love him, okay? Because...

or didn't mean to happen.

It happened.
And I know why it did.

- What are you...
- You told him because...

Deep down inside,
you want to be with me,

487
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,571

this would make it happen.

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,162
- That has nothing to do with this.
- Rachel.

491
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,204
And since you obviously came here
to find out where it is we stand,

492
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,207
let me tell you.

493
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,449
There is no "us."
There will never be an "us."

494
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,687
And no matter what happens
between me and Mike,

495
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,407
this is the last time that you and I are
ever gonna have a conversation again.

496
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,689
- You're my lawyer.
- Not anymore, Logan.

497
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,043
So, whatever real or fake meeting you
have with Harvey, you can go to it now.

498
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,001
But I won't be in it. Or any other meeting
you have here in the future.

499
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,605
Because we're done.

500
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,809
Louis, I'm glad you're here.

501
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,923
I just got off the phone
with Charles Forstman.

502
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:24,489
He wants to cross the "T's", dot the "I's",
and be done with this deal. And so do I.

503
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,087
Believe me, Jessica, nobody wants
to be done with that man more than me.

504
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,601
I'm actually heading
over there in an hour.

505
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,769
But before I do, I just wanted to tell you
that I finally figured out

506
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,884
- what I want as my reward.
- And what is that?

507
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,685
I want to amend my contract

508
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,610
to allow for telecommuting
whenever I deem appropriate,

509
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,122
and a month's more vacation every year
to be used at my discretion.

510
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,010
- Anything else?
- I want it in writing.

511
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,881
And I want my partnership protected
for as long as this situation persists.

512
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,481
Okay. Before I give you
what you're asking...

513
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,204
Jessica, you said I could have
whatever I want.

514
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,560
You're not gonna talk me out of this.

515
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,205
I'm not trying to talk you out of anything.

516
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,564
I just want to say that the fact
that name partner isn't happening now

517
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,529
doesn't mean it never will.

518
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,127
And I'd hate to see you throw in
the towel because you've lost faith.

519
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,569
Well, the only thing I'm throwing
is my hat in the ring for Sheila's heart.

520
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,043
- I don't understand.
- I love her. And I miss her.

521
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,010
And I want to try to win her back.

522
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,528
And I need these things
to make that happen.

523
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,610
Then, you have them.

524
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,844
- Rachel, are you okay?
- I don't know.

525
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,282
- Where are you going?
- I don't know. I just can't be here.

526
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,050
And I can't be at home.
I can't be anywhere.

527
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,647
- Go see him.
- I don't even know where he is.

528
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,326
- Yes, you do.
- I did see him.

529
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,086
He came here and
everything went to shit.

530
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,124
And I tried to explain,
and he wouldn't listen.

531
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,728
And then he said we're just done.

532
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,890
- Rachel...
- I'm sorry, Donna.

533
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,846
If it's about Mike, I'm busy.

534
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,844
Harvey, I know about
your issues with infidelity, but...

535
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,124
- Donna, stop right there.
- No, I'm not gonna stop.

536
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,447
Because you need to go talk
to Mike about Rachel.

537
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,689
- "Need"?
- Yes, need.

538
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,327
Listen to me,
because I'm only gonna say this once.

539
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,608
What she did is between
the two of them.

540
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,291
And I'm not gonna get
in the middle of it one way or another.

541
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,081
But if I did, it sure as shit
wouldn't be to defend her.

542
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,405
Harvey, your lack of emotional
awareness never ceases to amaze me.

543
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,851
What the hell are you talking about?

544
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,644
I'm not asking you
to do this for Rachel.

545
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,325
I'm asking you to do this for Mike.

546
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,405
Like I said, I'm busy.

547
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,730
May I?

548
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,763
Since when do you need permission?

549
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,123
- To come in, I don't.
- No, you don't.

550
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,642
And I'll come back when you're
in a more receptive mood.

551
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,722
What exactly am I being receptive to?

552
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,887
You are not just any partner in this firm.

553
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,691
You are the man I am involved with.
And...

554
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,451
I need to take that into consideration
from now on.

555
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,406
You sound like you're saying
that as damage control.

556
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,284
I'm saying it because I mean it.

557
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,523
Then why does it still sound
like you're talking to your employee?

558
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,881
Because it's hard for me

559
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,010
to say that I don't want to lose you
over some stupid work bullshit.

560
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,281
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

561
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,450
So you just wanted
to make it hard for me.

562
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,569
I just wanted to hear you say it.

563
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,883
It being hard for you is on you.

564
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,645
So, we're good.

565
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,890
Oh, yeah. We're good.

566
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,450
All right.

567
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,645
Jessica, one more thing.

568
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,209
If you don't want to lose me
over some stupid work bullshit,

569
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,211
then please don't do
stupid work bullshit.

570
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,405
You're fired.

571
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,723
Accept all terms and conditions,
blah blah, blah blah.

572
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,723
Yeah, it's all there. You just
need to sign by the arrows.

573
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,762
Mmm-hmm.

574
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,961
Walk me through this one more time.

575
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,566
It says Sanders International agrees to
pay you the aforementioned amount.

576
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,365
Through a Swiss account
or the Caymans?

577
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,290
Both. Per your instructions.
Now, are we done?

578
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,210
You went to a lot of trouble
to shelter some money for me.

579
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,609
- Because you forced me to.
- Which got me to wondering.

580
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,004
What's to keep you
from walking out of here,

581
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,849
growing a conscience,

582
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,247
and telling someone
about our little arrangement?

583
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,364
Because if I do, I'll be admitting to my
own guilt, which you damn well know.

584
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,531
Right.
But what exactly are you guilty of?

585
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,362
What is this?

586
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,131
That's your fee for putting
this deal together.

587
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,446
- I don't want a fee.
- That's exactly why you're gonna take it.

588
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,566
Son a bitch. You didn't bring me here
for you to sign on the arrows.

589
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,011
You brought me here for me
to sign on the arrows.

590
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,649
Yep. And I don't give a shit
what you do with the money

591
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,842
after it goes into your account,
but it's going in there.

592
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,522
- I won't.
- It's up to you.

593
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,888
Now, you can either close this deal,

594
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,005
or go back to writing in your diary

595
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,441
about what a loser
Harvey Specter thinks you are.

596
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,650
Sign it, pal.

597
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,282
I can't see where
you comin' from

598
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,851
But I know just what
you runnin' from

599
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,527
And what matters ain't
the "whet baddest" but the

600
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,486
The ones who stop
fallin' from your ladder, we know

601
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,888
This ain't no place
for no hero

602
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,290
This ain't no place
for no better man

603
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,087
This ain't no place
for no hero

604
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,847
To call home

605
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,565
- Mike, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

606
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,245
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

607
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,686
- I'm here to take a job.
- Wait, what?

608
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,850
No, no. You can't do that.

609
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,928
- What do you care?
- Mike, listen to me.

610
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,604
I know I am mad at you about Sheila.

611
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,288
But I don't care about that right now.
You cannot take a job with that man.

612
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,721
I don't have
any other options, Louis.

613
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,327
And I'm in this position
because you paid that man greenmail

614
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,965
to walk away from my deal
in the first place.

615
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,967
Believe me, I wish I hadn't.

616
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,849
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

617
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,802
[RUE

618
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,366
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

619
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,324
- None of it matters.
- This is about Rachel, isn't it?

620
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,850
She told me she hurt you.

621
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,122
Believe me, I understand.

622
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,242
But you cannot do this
because of that.

623
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,801
This is a job, Louis.
All right? I'm not robbing a bank.

624
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,809
It's not a job. It's a decision.

625
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,008
- And I'm not gonna let you make it.
- Yeah?

626
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,206
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Anything I have to.

627
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,007
- You wanted to see me?
- I thought you wanted to see me.

628
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,004
I wanted to see you both.

629
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,481
Louis.

630
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,961
Is this about implementing
your request with Sheila?

631
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,889
No, it's about retracting
my request with Sheila.

632
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,889
- What happened? I, I thought...
- Nothing happened.

633
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,002
- I hired Mike Ross back at the firm.
- What?

634
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,521
If Sheila and I are meant to be,
we'll make that work.

635
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,282
But Mike was gonna do something
that I could not let him do,

636
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,091
so I'm using my reward on him.

637
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,369
- Okay, Louis, I, I...
- It's a great choice. I'm proud of you.

638
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,769
Why don't you give me
a minute with Jessica

639
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,844
and see if we can't get him an office?

640
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,962
Thank you, Harvey.
Thank you both.

641
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,846
Is that it?

642
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,006
I'd still like to be able to take
Rosh Hashanah off, if that's okay.

643
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,124
I think we can work something out.

644
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,080
- No way.
- Jessica...

645
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,770
Mike Ross is not coming
back to this firm.

646
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,484
You heard Louis.
He already gave him the job.

647
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,161
- He can ungive him the job.
- It's too late for that and you know it.

648
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,362
Well, it damn sure didn't help
when you jumped on in there

649
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,921
- and told him it was a great choice.
- It was a great choice.

650
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,122
And if I hadn't jumped in
and let you speak your mind,

651
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,891
you know what he would have heard?
Something's wrong with Mike Ross.

652
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,889
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do. And so do you.

653
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,684
This is Louis we're talking about.

654
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,804
- And you rejected his first request.
- Because it was unreasonable.

655
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,890
And the only way you're gonna
convince him that this is unreasonable,

656
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,048
- is to tell him why.
- Harvey...

657
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,447
Jessica, the only way to make
him take that offer back

658
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,641
is to force him to do it.

659
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,047
Because he's gonna ask you
why again and again.

660
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,686
And no matter what you say,
he's gonna know you're full of shit.

661
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,889
And then, how long do you think
it's gonna take him

662
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,525
to remember that last year,

663
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,961
he wondered if Mike
even went to Harvard?

664
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,690
You could at least pretend
to hide how happy you are.

665
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,525
I may be happy about it,
but you know I'm right.

666
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,243
And the truth is, I never should have
let him go in the first place.

667
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,846
(DOOR OPENING)

668
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,649
You look a lot better
than the last time I saw you.

669
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,922
Oh, didn't you hear?
I got a new job.

670
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,003
Oh, I heard.

671
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,329
- What are you getting at there, Harvey?
- What am I getting at?

672
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,525
Louis hires you, you don't run it by me,
you don't even tell me it's happening.

673
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,089
All I am anymore to you
is a clean set of sheets.

674
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,090
Speaking of which, you might
want to up the thread count.

675
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,042
And "run it by you"?

676
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,810
You were practically begging me
to come back yesterday.

677
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,891
I didn't beg shit. I posited a theory. We
both knew it was never gonna happen.

678
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,490
I was just trying
to make you feel better.

679
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,841
Well, I guess it took Louis
to do what you couldn't do.

680
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,089
Hire an unqualified fraud?

681
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,091
I did that already.

682
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,526
Seriously, Mike, it's good
to have things back to normal.

683
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,042
Yeah, normal.

684
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,891
Mike, I'm gonna say something to you
that I have never told you before.

685
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,169
I admire what you have with Rachel.

686
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,084
- Harvey...
- No, let me finish.

687
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,526
It's real,

688
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,043
it's hard to come by, and all you have
to do to keep it is forgive her.

689
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,849
So, if you want to stay here tonight,

690
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,840
by all means.
But I think you should go home.

691
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,200
Where are you going?

692
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,729
I have to take care of something
I should have days ago.

693
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,691
(DOOR CLOSING)

694
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,446
- Harvey, you wanted to see me?
- Yes.

695
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,007
I wanted you to take a look at a draft of
the paperwork to wrap up your deal.

696
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,771
- Why would you...
- Because I wanted to let you know

697
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,251
how things are gonna be
moving forward.

698
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,324
You're gonna sign these papers
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

699
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,283
And at 8:01...

700
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,331
...you're gone.

701
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,801
Harvey.

702
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,571
Look, I don't give a shit
how much business you give my firm.

703
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,806
I never want to see you again.

704
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,601
- You're really going to drop me?
- You're damn right I am.

705
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,446
And if you go to Jessica
to try to overrule me,

706
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,531
the next time, it won't be Mike
you get in a fight with. It'll be me.

707
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,446
You are the abstract art
of pain and poem

708
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,848
When our propaganda
makes everything clear

709
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,084
You are the thirsty throat,
the desert defeat

710
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,327
When there's water

711
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,167
Everywhere

712
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,447
- You're home.
- I am.

713
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,045
Why aren't you at work?

714
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,807
Because I spent the whole day
moving from one place to another

715
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,570
and I just had to talk to you.

716
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,843
How'd you know I'd be here?

717
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,202
I didn't. I just went to Harvey's.

718
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,404
Yeah. I'm not there anymore.

719
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,961
- Are you back here?
- No.

720
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,085
No, I'm going to, um,
stay somewhere for a while.

721
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,281
Mike, please...

722
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,085
Rachel, whatever you're
gonna say now is not the time to say it.

723
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,967
If you want there to be
a chance for us,

724
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,485
at all,

725
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,967
just go back out for a little longer
and let me get my things together.

726
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,005
One more thing.

727
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,322
I'm coming back to work tomorrow.

728
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,924
If you can't accept that, then whatever
you were gonna say to me

729
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,321
won't matter.

730
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,923
You are the stranger
in the nighttime

731
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,930
Throwing us to the ground

732
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,125
When all we wanna do

733
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,963
Is get away

734
