<i>OLDER TED: When your Uncle Marshall
was 10 years old,</i>

3
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:17,978
<i>he read a book called
Life Among The Gorillas.</i>

4
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:22,479
<i>It was written by an anthropologist
named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,</i>

5
00:00:22,575 --> 00:00:24,203
<i>and it told the story of the year she spent...</i>

6
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:27,715
<i>living among the western lowland gorillas
of Cameroon.</i>

7
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,535
<i>When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez...</i>

8
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:32,090
<i>came to the local community college
to give a lecture,</i>

9
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:34,197
<i>Marshall, the youngest member
of the audience,</i>

10
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:36,688
<i>raised his hand with a question.</i>

11
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:39,688
What advice do you have
for a budding anthropologist?

12
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,508
So, you want to be an anthropologist?

13
00:00:41,604 --> 00:00:44,957
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live
with the gorillas just like you did.

14
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:47,543
<i>OLDER TED: What she said next
changed his life.</i>

15
00:00:47,639 --> 00:00:50,704
Oh, that's wonderful,
but I'm afraid you can't.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,077
They'll all be dead by then.

17
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:58,271
And if economic sanctions
and trade restrictions aren't enforced,

18
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,154
the destruction of the rainforests
will continue,

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:03,157
and over a million species
will be wiped out.

20
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:04,752
So you don't want coffee?

21
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:07,275
I'm saying that the coffee industry
is causing irreversible...

22
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,829
- All right, I'm pouring it out.
- Okay, one cup.

Kid needs to be alert.
First day on the job and everything.

24
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:15,034
Still can't believe you're going
all corporate on us.

25
00:01:15,128 --> 00:01:17,325
The Kid has become the man.

26
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:19,758
Okay, it's just an internship
to make a little money.

27
00:01:19,854 --> 00:01:22,281
After law school,
I'm still gonna work for the NRDC.

28
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:24,005
They're gonna stop global warming.

they did their best.</i>

30

(CHUCKLING)

32
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,817
Okay. I love you because, one,
you made me a sack lunch,

33

every time you say the word 'sack.'

Uh-oh.

38
00:01:43,992 --> 00:01:46,353
- Ted?
- Oh, no!

39
00:01:46,546 --> 00:01:49,612
- No, she didn't.
- Yeah. Yeah, she did.

40
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,496
Another care package?

41
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:53,092
<i>OLDER TED: Another care package.</i>

<i>Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.</i>

44
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:03,213
- How many is that so far?
- Three.

45
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:05,830
And how many have you sent her?

46
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:08,433
In the mail or in my mind? Zero.

47
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:09,917
She's up three-zip.

48
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:12,343
Oh! Cupcakes. Great.

49
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,119
I bet they're delicious, too.

50
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,552
Yeah. They're delicious.

51
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,878
Damn it!

52
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:24,236
I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes.

53
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,251
God, I hate myself right now.

54
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:29,735

<i>Altrucel was most well-known
for making the yellow fuzzy stuff...</i>

<i>on the surface of tennis balls.</i>

58
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:44,631
<i>I mean, this was a huge company,
so they did other things.</i>

59
00:02:45,422 --> 00:02:48,615
<i>But mostly, they wanted the public
to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff.</i>

60
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,776
<i>Anyway, Marshall managed to score
an internship in their legal department...</i>

61

Oh, and don't worry. Yours is in the mail.
I sent it a couple days ago.

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,187
But how's she gonna feel
in a couple of years...

166
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,933
when she's supporting you
on a kindergarten-teacher's salary,

167
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:06,497
while you're off in court,

168
00:08:06,593 --> 00:08:11,122
defending some endangered
South American flying beaver.

169
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:14,510
I know.

170
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:17,119
- She'll be happy.
- Okay.

171
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:19,716
But will you be happy,

172
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:23,472
knowing you could have
made her a lot happier?

173
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:28,017
And all four are totally naked.
You gotta choose one.

174
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:30,027
What do you do? Go.

175
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:34,530
I guess, uh, Bea Arthur.

176
00:08:34,658 --> 00:08:35,647
(IMITATING BUZZER SOUNDING)

177
00:08:35,743 --> 00:08:37,657
Wrong. Betty White.

178
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,199
Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.

179
00:08:43,722 --> 00:08:45,957
So, did she get
the awesome care package, yet?

180
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,297
Yep. Yesterday.

181
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,203
- Did she love it?
- Oh, she loved it.

182
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,213
So, what's the problem?

183
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,673
So, I was taIking to her last night,
and I should tell you,

184
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,302
we've been taIking on the phone
every other night,

185
00:08:56,398 --> 00:09:01,665
for, like, an hour and a half.
Eventually, you just run out of stuff to say.

186
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:04,252
What did you have for lunch today?

187
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:05,337
Mmm-hmm.

188
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:07,347
Oh, rye bread.

189
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:09,421
Oh.

190
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:11,532
(SIGHING)

191
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:13,541
Mmm-hmm.

192
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,745
Yeah.

193
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:17,755
Mmm.

194
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:23,345
Oh, Teddy boy.

195
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,197
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend,

196
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:27,496
but this never-seeing-each-other thing,
it's a bitch.

197
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:29,667
Maybe it just can't be done.

198
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:32,189
I think it's clear what I have to do.

199
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,199
It's pretty clear.

200
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,234
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.

201
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:41,559
Totally what I was thinking.
Get out of my head, man.

202
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,143
Barney, how do I get these idiots
to leave me alone?

203
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,841
Marshall, consider the penguins.

204
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,694
- The penguins?
- On the wall.

205
00:09:59,487 --> 00:10:03,351
'Conformity. It's the one who's different
that gets left out in the cold.'

206
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,171
This is a motivational poster?

207
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,182
Look at yourself, Marshall.
You're not happy.

208
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,120
And you know why?
Because you're different.

209
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:12,450
Now, I suppose you could learn
to love yourself...

210
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:15,036
for the unique little snowflake that you are.

211
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:17,528
Or you could change
your entire personality,

212
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:19,982
which is just so much easier.

213
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:25,126
Change your personality? That is so awful.
And not at all motivational.

214
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:27,904
Not necessarily.
Okay, at first, I was appalled.

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,180
But then I realized...

216
00:10:29,276 --> 00:10:32,916
<i>it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez
in Life Among The Gorillas.</i>

217
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,151
No, I have to gain the acceptance
of the herd...

218
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:37,354
by behaving exactly like one of them.

219
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:40,165
It's an anthropological study.
Isn't that cool?

220
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:42,271
Well, it sounds kind of like peer pressure.

221
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:45,273
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological.

222
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,508
And it's cool. And I'm doing it.

223
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:51,850
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure.
We have an assembly every year.

224
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,992
I'm portraying someone
who succumbs to peer pressure.

225
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:57,237
All right.

226
00:10:57,237 --> 00:11:01,229
But if those guys try to pressure you
to smoke, what do you say?

227
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:04,009
- Only when I'm drunk.
- Good boy.

228
00:11:04,326 --> 00:11:05,922
<i>OLDER TED: And so,
to fit in with the gorillas,</i>

229
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:08,317
<i>Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla.</i>

230
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:10,488
<i>And that meant gorilla lessons.</i>

231
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:14,352
Okay. I'm psyched about this.
But if I'm gonna mentor you,

232
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:16,107
I need to know
you're psyched about this, too.

233
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:18,141
Oh, I am. I'm psyched.

234
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:23,706
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it.
It's another thing to show it.

235
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:25,716
Show it.

236
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,314
I'm psyched.

237
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,740
What was that?

238
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,042
Marshall, I should feel
tremors of psychetude...

239
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:40,467
rock my body like a seizure.

240
00:11:40,564 --> 00:11:45,545
That was like a declawed, pregnant cat
on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly...

241
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,837
on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

242
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:53,151
- Wow, that was really specific.
- Show me you're psyched!

243
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:57,006
Let's do this!

244
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,496
- That hurt!
- So badly!

245
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:03,553
And then you slip it to the guy
with a discreet handshake,

246
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,628
- and he'll get it done.
- Right.

247
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,810
Get what done?

248
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:10,158
- Whatever.
- Cool. And what guy is this?

249
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:13,961
- There's always a guy.
- Okay. All right. I, uh...

250
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,781
- I think I'm ready.
- You sure?

251
00:12:15,877 --> 00:12:18,910
You want to practice your story
one more time?

252
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,920
All right.

253
00:12:22,933 --> 00:12:26,988
So, dude, check it. I'm in San Diego
with two of my brosephs from Kappa,

254
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:30,788
and they're all,
'Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs!'

255
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,055
So, I'm like, 'A-snappa-doo!'

256
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,514
So we find this choice nudie nest
near the airport.

257
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:38,482
And that is when the bouncer
kicked us out.

258
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:41,739
Now, I have no idea
if Svetlana ever got her green card,

259
00:12:41,835 --> 00:12:44,274
but, dudes, fake diamond ring?

260
00:12:44,613 --> 00:12:46,527
Worth every penny, bro.

261
00:12:47,837 --> 00:12:52,496
Eriksen, that was steak sauce!

262
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,692
- Awesome, bro.
- Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:57,823
- Get out!
- Great story.

264
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,802
<i>OLDER TED: The next morning,
I was about to buy my ticket to Germany,</i>

- So?
- So, she's gonna dump me.

Has anyone ever said,
'Listen, I've been thinking,'

273
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,119
and then followed it up
with something good?

274
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:37,100
It's not like, 'Listen, I've been thinking,
Nutter Butters are an underrated cookie.'

275
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,313
What else could it be?

276
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,411
What could she possibly have to say to me
that she couldn't write in an e-mail?

277
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:43,540
I cut off all my fingers.

278
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:48,722
Ted, you're a great guy. I know it.
You know it. She knows it.

279
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:52,234
I would bet you a gazillion dollars.
No, I'm even more confident.

280
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,290
I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars
that she's not calling to break up with you.

281
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,972
Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy.

Why?

332
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:17,210
What do you say?

333
00:16:21,906 --> 00:16:23,151
- Yes!
- My man!

334
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:25,961
- I told you he would.
- BILSON: We are gonna have a hoot.

- We're gonna own the office.
- Steak sauce.

336
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:34,059
Okay, that was gross.

337
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:37,315
When were you gonna tell me
you changed your entire career path?

338
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,987
Nothing has changed, okay?
I still want to help the environment.

339
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:44,275
I just thought that maybe
I can make some money for a few years.

340
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,915
We could buy an apartment,
send our kids to good schools.

341
00:16:48,011 --> 00:16:50,150
You could quit your job
and focus on your painting,

342
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:52,194
I know that you say you don't need it,

343
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,641
but I love you
and I want to give it to you anyway.

344
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:57,846
I want to give you the package.

345
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,345
The package?

346
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:03,656
You've already given me the package.
You've got a great package, Marshall.

347
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:05,316
I love your package.

348
00:17:05,412 --> 00:17:08,413
Lily, you're the most
incredible woman I know...

349
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:10,949
and you deserve a big package.

350
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:14,476
Your package has always been big enough.

351
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,672
You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen,

352
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:20,208

Okay, you're making yourself crazy.

358
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:37,404
It's Saturday night.
Go out and do something.

359
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,331
No, what's the point of going out?
I got a girlfriend. For now.

360
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,832
Besides, if I go out,
who's gonna watch the news?

361
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:43,981
I'm like half your viewership.

362
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:46,887
Oh, I'm flattered
you think we have two viewers.

363
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,632
She's not gonna break up with you, Ted.
You're awesome.

364
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:53,241
Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00.
I should let you go.

Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you
in a month.

372
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,307
Yeah.

373
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,471
Yeah. How're you doing?

374
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:29,607
I think Victoria's about to break up with me.

Oh, God. I'm sorry, man.

376
00:18:31,746 --> 00:18:33,659
Yeah, well,

377
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,525
honestly, I'm having trouble
remembering what she looks like.

378
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,793
The more I try to picture her,
the more I can't.

379
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:44,613
Like, I remember how she makes me feel,
I just don't completely remember her.

380
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:48,171
It's like I'm trying to preserve something
that's already gone.

381

Preserving something that's already gone.

382
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,591
Sounds like environmental law.

00:18:53,056 --> 00:18:54,398
I don't know.

384
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:57,047
I mean, we struggle so hard
to hold on to these things...

385
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:59,314
that we know
are gonna disappear eventually.

386
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,263
And that's really noble.

387
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:04,550
But even if you save every rainforest
from being turned into a parking lot,

388

well, then,
where are you gonna park your car?
