18
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,710
Severe Winter Weather Advisories

20
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,290
have been issued from Kansas to western Minnesota.

21
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,280
Severe ice and snow reported.

22
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,850
Temperatures will likely reach below 20 degrees,

23
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,680
and wind chill...

24
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,330
Shaun.

25
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,500
Shaun.

26
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,980
There is a severe weather warning in Minnesota.

27
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,260
You haven't been at work in three days.

28
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,140
I want to be left alone.

29
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,880
I'm sorry she hurt you.

30
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,390
But you are strong.

31
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,480
You're the most determined man I know.

32
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,170
You're gonna get through this.

33
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,550
I wish I was...

34
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,530
normal.

35
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,970
Everyone wishes they were normal, Shaun.

36
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,930
You need to get up.

37
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,180
You need to do your exercise routine,

38
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,440
then shower, shave, and get to work.

39
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,130
And not because your patients need your help,

40
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,810
but because it'll make you feel better.

41
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm not leaving without you.

42
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,730
Your sleep apnea is worse than we'd thought.

43
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,350
You have a condition related to your pseudoachondroplasia

44
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,360
that is narrowing the base of your skull

45
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,230
and compressing the part of your brain

46
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,840
that controls your breathing.

47
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,020
People always say I'm too full of myself.

48
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,330
Guess it's actually true.

49
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,790
Finn, this is serious.

50
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,790
Don't worry. I'm gonna be fine.

51
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,670
We can remove bone from the wall of your skull

52
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,870
and resect a small section of your cerebellum

53
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,500
to reduce brain-stem pressure.

54
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,650
You're -- you're gonna cut out a piece of his brain?

55
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,570
It won't affect your intellect,

56
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,820
but it will cause a speech impediment

57
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,600
and some difficulty with balance.

58
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,100
I'd rather you knock a few points off my IQ.

59
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,170
Stop it.

60
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,430
I'm serious.

61
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,120
My "Gift of gab" is what you love about me.

62
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,480
Uh, w-what's option two?

63
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,330
I'm sorry, there is no other option.

64
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,010
I'm a salesman. I don't hear the word "No."

65
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,630
Th-there's always another way.

66
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,570
You just got to think outside the box.

67
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,980
We've already done that,

68
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,780
which is how we came up with this surgery.

69
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,240
It's the only way to keep you alive,

70
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,480
so you have no choice but to accept it.

71
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,150
Dr. Murphy is being rude and insensitive...

72
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,410
but he's also right.

73
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,310
Finn, please, I love you.

74
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,190
And I will always be here for you

75
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,870
no matter how you talk or walk.

76
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,600
But you have to listen to your doctors.

77
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,720
I love you, too.

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,850
Do whatever you think's best.

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,770
Let me guess.

82
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,680
I'm gonna need another surgery.

83
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,500
What's that now, my tenth?

84
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,420
Eleventh.

85
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,460
And I still can't work the farm;

86
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,230
can't drive a tractor, pull a combine lever.

87
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
I can't even twist open a bottle of beer.

88
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,780
When we met, you were in an ambulance

89
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,800
and your arms were still in your harvester.

90
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,290
Today you have sensation and almost full mobility.

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,330
Now we just need to treat the neuropathy

92
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,280
and improve your strength.

93
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,900
So how do we do that?

94
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,030
I'm thinking a gracilis muscle transfer.

95
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,560
That should improve his grip and relieve some of the pain,

96
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,000
but there's only one way to eliminate all of it.

97
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,020
Tyson, have you given any more thought to amputation

98
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,320
and osseointegrated prosthetic arms?

99
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,330
They'd attach directly to the bones and nerves in your forearm,

100
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,460
and you can control them just like your own hands.

101
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,110
Function would be reduced in some respects.

102
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,050
Less dexterity, no sensory feedback.

103
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,990
But others, like grip strength, would be better.

104
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,150
And more importantly, you'd be pain-free.

105
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,190
I want to be a farmer,

106
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,500
not a cyborg.

107
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,450
Okay.

108
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,080
The pain's getting worse.

109
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,710
Probably because I've been crazy busy in the O.R.

110
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,410
with Murphy out till today.

111
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,930
He's back?

112
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,250
Only because Brown went to his apartment

113
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,630
and dragged his ass in.

114
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,820
She shouldn't have done that.

115
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,450
He's trying to work this out on his own.

116
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,800
That's a good thing.

117
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,970
DMARDs aren't working.

118
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,760
I know.

119
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,890
Which is why I've been thinking about synovectomy surgery.

120
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,770
You're gonna remove the joint linings in your fingers?

121
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,940
That'll resolve the pain temporarily.

122
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,650
Then what?

123
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,590
It'll give me at least ten years.

124
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,390
And then you're gonna be bone on bone;

125
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,330
every joint in your hand will be mangled and deformed.

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
What's your plan then?

127
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,710
Who knows what treatments will be available in ten years?

128
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,760
Have you thought about oncology?

129
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,280
Surgeons do the real work.

130
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,210
They cut out the tumor; they cure the patient.

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,060
Oncologists just sweep up after.

132
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,680
You want to know an even better job?

133
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,910
Starting pitcher for the Oakland A's.

134
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,050
You want to know why I didn't get that job?

135
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,660
Because the scouts didn't like the way you wore your hat?

136
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,260
Yeah, that, and I was born with this arm.

137
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,530
You were born with those hands.

138
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,390
What are you gonna do,

139
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,290
practice surgery for a few more years

140
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,570
and then spend the rest of your life

141
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,430
not being able to pick up a pencil?

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,920
You can pursue another specialty.

143
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,260
You can practice for the rest of your life.

144
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,340
You get rear-ended on the way to work

145
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,980
or you just hate little people?

146
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,850
Neither. EKG is normal.

147
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,730
So you got dumped.

148
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,850
No, I didn't.

149
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,130
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

150
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,090
We were never even going out.

151
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:01,840
Finn?

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,120
I've been worried sick.

153
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,830
Take it easy.

154
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,550
I told you to stay home. There's nothing to worry about.

155
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,180
Stop trying to act so tough.

156
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,140
You shouldn't have to go through this alone.

157
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,540
Sorry, baby, but you should wait outside.

158
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:23,490
Let the doctors finish up, and I'll be right out.

159
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,170
He's not going to the O.R. for a while,

160
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,660
so there will be plenty of time to visit when we're done.

161
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,410
Okay.

162
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,270
I'll be right outside.

163
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,660
Is there any way you could make sure

164
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,170
she and Nathalie stay in separate waiting rooms

165
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,040
and aren't allowed to visit at the same time?

166
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,040
No. We're not helping you cheat.

167
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,520
I'm not cheating.

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,590
I've always made it clear I'm not ready to settle down,

169
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,300
but sometimes women m-make assumptions.

170
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,620
Oh, and you don't feel the need to correct that?

171
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,290
I understand you don't approve,

172
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,530
but all I'm asking

173
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,910
is for you to help me get through brain surgery

174
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,250
without emotional turmoil

175
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,940
that I assume would be harmful to my recovery.

176
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,470
Okay.

177
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,980
Thank you.

178
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,070
Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing?

179
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,760
The tendons are encased in scar tissue.

180
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,310
The gracilis muscle transfer isn't gonna work.

181
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,670
It still could.

182
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,870
If we attach the muscle

183
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,070
further down the forearm and bypass the scar ball.

184
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,440
It wouldn't hold.

185
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,070
There'd be too much tension on the graft.

186
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,300
We can figure out a way to work around that.

187
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
Let's wake him up and put him back in his room

188
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,900
and pull every paper on free-muscle and nerve transfers.

189
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,390
His only option is double amputation

190
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,260
and the osseointegrated prosthetics.

191
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,990
We don't have a choice.

192
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,940
Yes, we do.

193
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,500
And as Chief of Surgery, I just made it.

194
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,000
He doesn't really look the part.

195
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,160
He's a handsome guy with a great sense of humor

196
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,410
and a high-paying job.

197
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,040
He means because women don't like

198
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,230
to be in relationships with men who are weird.

199
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,910
He's not weird. And neither are you.

200
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,700
And a week ago, you were juggling two women,

201
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,720
so stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

202
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,610
Have you ever dated anyone who wasn't tall,

203
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,200
handsome, and neurotypical?

204
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,940
It's not about me.

205
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,620
- Talk to me. - He stopped breathing,

206
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,960
and I haven't even administered the paralytics.

207
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,820
What just happened?

208
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,630
Pressure on the medulla must be getting worse.

209
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,630
He's lucky he didn't wait any longer to come in.

210
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,960
Let's tube him and get to work.

211
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,810
Wait.

212
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,100
Flex his head into position again.

213
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,300
Extend his neck.

214
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,240
What's going on?

215
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,680
Flexing the neck offsets the posterior compression.

216
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,990
But that should take the pressure off,

217
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,940
not make it worse.

218
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,160
Doesn't make any sense.

219
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,910
And we're not gonna do brain surgery on him until it does.

220
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,110
I don't see anything different in the flexed-neck views.

221
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,650
Should his C2 bone be curved inward like that?

222
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,110
It could exacerbate the narrowing on the front of his --

223
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,270
It's not significant.

224
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,830
Well, if his apnea's getting worse

225
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,970
because of pressure from the front as well as the back --

226
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,140
The treatment is the same.

227
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,420
Surgery to create more room in the skull base.

228
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,710
It's not the same, and stop interrupting me.

229
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,660
If we drill off the C2 in the front,

230
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,940
as well as open the back,

231
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,510
we might not have to resect the cerebellum.

232
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,410
He wouldn't have any speech impediment or balance issues.

233
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,880
We'd have to approach through his mouth;

234
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,750
a bacteria-rich environment,

235
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,230
which can't be fully sterilized.

236
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,550
There would be too high a risk of a post-op brain infection.

237
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,650
So we figure out another approach.

238
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,680
There's only one safe way to access the C2.

239
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,170
Okay, so come up with something outside the box.

240
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,900
No, that's a stupid expression.

241
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,930
There is no box.

242
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,370
And you are wasting valuable time

243
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,290
just because you want to be nice to her.

244
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,650
- Murphy - We should do the cerebellar

245
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,610
surgery before he has a fatal apnea --

246
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,490
Murphy.

247
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,180
I'm not being nice.

248
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,670
I'm using my experience and judgment to make the call.

249
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,390
That's my job.

250
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,680
- You are being nice. - And you're being a jerk.

251
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
You've got the night.

252
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,810
If you two can't come up with a solution by morning,

253
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,650
we'll proceed with the original plan.

255
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,640
Your patient's in desperate need

256
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,320
of an Oklahoma weather report?

257
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,620
I didn't even want to be here today.

258
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,500
You should try a martial arts class.

259
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,880
Focused distraction is key to dealing with stress and heartbreaks.

260
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,020
That's just avoiding the problem.

261
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,060
Don't obsess over what you've lost,

262
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,290
focus on what you've gained from the relationship.

263
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,790
I hate to interrupt group therapy,

264
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,460
but what if we approached through the side of the neck?

265
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,440
We could transpose the vertebral artery,

266
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,960
open up the spine laterally to drill off the C2.

267
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,170
It would leave his spine permanently unstable

268
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,540
and could cause a stroke.

269
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,470
There might be a way to mitigate stroke risk.

270
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,340
And he'd still have the instability and --

271
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,410
Come on, Shaun.

272
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,700
I need help, not criticism.

273
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,980
I have always supported you

274
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,230
when you were trying to come up with

275
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,770
an unconventional treatment option.

276
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,890
You supported me when you thought I was right.

277
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,970
What do you guys think?

278
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,860
We gotta go.

279
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,670
We do?

280
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,930
We remove the scar tissue and the nerves.

281
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,560
Then harvest nerves from his upper arm

282
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,780
to rewire his forearms.

283
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,000
It'll improve his grip,

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,290
and with the scar tissue removed,

285
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,490
the pain should decrease, too.

286
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,940
Does nothing to solve the blood-flow problem

287
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,070
that's causing the scarring.

288
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,230
I'm sure we can come up with a solve for that.

289
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,140
That's what you said last time.

290
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,050
And I was right. We're making progress.

291
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,890
Would you two give us a moment?

292
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,940
We'll meet you in the Residents' Lounge when we're done.

293
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,700
Are you so against the prosthetics

294
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,350
because you think it's in Tyson's best interest?

295
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,750
Or because it's my idea?

296
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,190
You think I care whose idea anything is?

297
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,980
You're a competitive person

298
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,380
working with the guy who used to hold your job.

299
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,870
I'll admit my competitive drive may kick up a notch

300
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,250
when we work together.

301
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,730
I'll also admit that I admire the courage

302
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,750
of a guy who stumbled a half-mile back to his house

303
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,540
after his arms were ripped off by a combine.

304
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,230
He opened a door with his mouth

305
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,250
and dialed 911 with his nose,

306
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,160
and as long as he wants to keep fighting,

307
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,730
I'm gonna fight along with him.

308
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,340
Which has nothing to do with my ego.

309
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,980
Good.

310
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,070
That's all I wanted to confirm.

311
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,140
But I'm gonna start prepping for the amputation

312
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,440
because that's the only rational choice we have,

313
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,700
which I'm confident you'll realize soon enough.

314
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,980
Make any progress?

315
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:39,730
Yeah, I figured out a lateral approach,

316
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,170
but Shaun thinks it would leave his spine unstable

317
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,890
and increase his risk of stroke.

318
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,900
- I agree. - Yeah, me too.

319
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,780
There has to be a way to mitigate the --

320
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,570
Dr. Browne?

321
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,170
These just got delivered.

322
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,180
- Enjoy. - Thanks.

323
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,580
Dash is a romantic.

324
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,500
Thought you hated romantics.

325
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,920
Yeah, he's -- he's teasing me.

326
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,260
I told him I thought guys who sent flowers were lame.

327
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,610
We haven't even kissed yet.

328
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,330
What are you waiting for?

329
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,430
I don't know.

330
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,920
I enjoy being with him.

331
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,810
Actually, I forgot how funny he is.

332
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,340
Just...hasn't seemed like the right time.

333
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,300
I'm more worried about the stroke risk

334
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,830
than spinal instability,

335
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,530
so focus on fixing that.

336
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:44,280
Okay.

337
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,010
And, Claire, if he's the right guy,

338
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,960
stop holding out for the right time.

339
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,320
Your vitals are stable.

340
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,760
The nurses will monitor you during the night.

341
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,880
Your problem's simple to solve.

342
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,910
You just need to ask someone else out.

343
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,470
Lea was special.

344
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,450
I'm sure she was.

345
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,370
But there are so many others, just as special.

346
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,850
You just have to get to know them.

347
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,730
No, I don't want to.

348
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,050
Yes, you do.

349
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,150
You think I don't know how you feel?

350
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,090
Afraid of being rejected because you're too...

351
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,110
different.

352
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,270
Finally I decided, screw it.

353
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,590
I started talking to every woman I saw.

354
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,150
Street corners, elevators, grocery stores.

355
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,270
And I learned I'm pretty good at it.

356
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,860
That's my gift.

357
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
Everyone has one.

358
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,920
They just...

359
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,150
have to figure out what it is...

360
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,270
Okay. Code Blue!

361
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,670
Code Blue!

362
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,820
Murphy and I just inserted a diaphragmatic pacemaker on Finn.

363
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,140
It'll only trigger shallow breaths,

364
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,910
so he's at high risk for pneumonia.

365
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,350
You got anything?

366
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,850
Yeah, I was thinking of using

367
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,480
a more inferior transatlas approach.

368
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,310
That would minimize stroke risk.

369
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,790
That won't work.

370
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,330
It would destabilize the C1-2 joint.

371
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,640
You did all you could.

372
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,440
Go home.

373
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,660
We'll do the original cerebellar surgery

374
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,970
first thing in the morning.

375
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,950
So I'll be able to work the farm.

376
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,800
We still need to find a way to increase blood flow.

377
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,860
You should regain most of your grip and forearm strength,

378
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,920
but you'd still be in some pain.

379
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,860
I-I can handle it.

380
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,200
Can you?

381
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,840
How can you know for sure?

382
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,970
As the years go by and the pain doesn't stop...

383
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,310
will you change your mind?

384
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,920
Because it'll be too late.

385
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,550
What's wrong? What are you -- what are you feeling?

386
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,230
Like a horse just kicked in my chest.

387
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,160
I need an echo and pulmonary cath kit!

388
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,570
And page Lim, stat!

389
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,570
I think the last time

390
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,700
that I was at an actual punk-rock show was, uh...

391
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,270
College.

392
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,050
Patti Smith.

393
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,860
Oh, my God!

394
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,750
I completely forgot about that.

395
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,470
You forgot getting your ass tossed offstage

396
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,230
by a 60-year-old woman?

397
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,100
Yeah.

398
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,020
Remember what you said when we picked you up?

399
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,830
Uh, oh, something about her being, uh, thin but strong?

400
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,300
"Thin but wiry."

401
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,340
- Wiry. - Wiry.

402
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,120
Okay, well, I, um...

403
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,400
I have an early surgery, so I should probably get going.

404
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,010
- Okay. - Okay.

405
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,570
Have a good night.

406
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,620
Good night.

407
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,250
I got an idea.

408
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,950
Actually, you had it first.

409
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,280
It's the right approach, just the wrong route.

410
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,490
We go in from the back, posterior transdural,

411
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,580
gently move your spinal cord out of the way

412
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,770
so we can drill off the misshaped C2.

413
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,440
There is a risk of paralysis,

414
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,340
but we would be monitoring your spinal functions

415
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,180
to help avoid any nerve injuries.

416
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,260
Let's do it. Where do I have to sign?

417
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,830
You shouldn't sign anything.

418
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,290
Consenting to this surgery

419
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,070
would be incredibly shortsighted and reckless.

420
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,680
It is one thing

421
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,340
to take your bad mood out on your colleagues,

422
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,530
but to try and undermine my surgical advice --

423
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,240
My opinion's valid.

424
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,540
Well, thankfully, he disagrees.

425
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,460
He's risking paralysis to be charming.

426
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,350
Because people expect everyone to be perfect.

427
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,830
Everyone's opinion is valid

428
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,130
all the way until we go into the patient room.

429
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,520
We are a team with one opinion.

430
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,550
I...

431
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,560
I don't feel better!

432
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,900
I feel worse!

433
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,710
And doing the wrong surgery

434
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,000
is not going to help anyone.

435
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,500
I don't want to do it; I'm going home.

436
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,660
You're not walking out on your patient or your team.

437
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,330
I still have two sick days

438
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,560
and 76 hours of unused P.T.O.

439
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,290
You're not sick,

440
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,550
and you're in the middle of a case.

441
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,040
I don't care about the case or the patient.

442
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,850
I don't care about anything.

443
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,990
I've had my heart broken twice in the last few years.

444
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,120
You want to know what I did?

445
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,640
I came to work every day

446
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,790
and pretended everything was fine.

447
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,130
Until, eventually,

448
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,500
I wasn't pretending anymore.

449
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,300
That's not helpful at all.

450
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,310
How about this?

451
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,200
Go back in there

452
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,950
and help Claire prep Finn for surgery,

453
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,560
or you won't be my resident.

454
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,440
Or anyone else's at St. Bonaventure.

455
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,240
And I know you care about that.

456
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,550
We were able to clear the clot,

457
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,390
but due to the restricted arteries in your arms,

458
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,620
we're gonna need to keep you on blood thinners...

459
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,940
indefinitely.

460
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,770
Okay.

461
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,820
The blood thinners make the reconstructive surgery impossible.

462
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,240
We have no choice but to amputate.

463
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,870
I'm sorry.

464
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,000
No.

465
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,040
I'm not letting you cut off my arms.

466
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,590
I don't want false limbs.

467
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,400
I don't want to be that guy.

468
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,840
I want to be who I am.

469
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,770
You are the toughest,

470
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,350
most tenacious person I've ever met.

471
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,160
And that is not gonna change

472
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,770
because we replace your hands with titanium.

473
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,490
It's time to let go.

474
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,000
Okay.

475
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,040
Okay.

476
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,030
Any way you could draw a skull

477
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,720
with a cobra coming out of its eyes while you're back there?

478
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,910
Would you settle for a lame smiley face?

479
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,440
Because that is the only thing I can draw.

480
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,360
There's my favorite nurse.

481
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,370
Did you check out that Ethiopian place

482
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,460
I told you about last night?

483
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,960
Actually, I did, and the kik alicha was delish.

484
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,380
Now, if you want a truly life-changing meal,

485
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,380
you need to try Lennon's on Sixth.

486
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,080
- Is it expensive? - Outrageously.

487
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,330
But worth it.

488
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,310
Now, it's all white tablecloths and candles,

489
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,790
so you'll need a date.

490
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,300
How 'bout Dr. Murphy?

491
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,820
You told me yourself he's a gifted surgeon.

492
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,510
That's pretty high praise.

493
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,600
And he told me you're cute.

494
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,620
Good luck today.

495
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,610
Thanks.

496
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,540
I totally teed you up.

497
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,340
All you had to do was take a swing.

498
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,570
I'm not interested in her.

499
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,090
If she's not your type,

500
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,300
I'm sure there are plenty of other cool nurses

501
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,390
roaming around here

502
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,060
who could make you feel better about yourself.

503
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,180
He's miserable because he's had two relationships blow up.

504
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,130
I don't think jumping into another one is the answer.

505
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,300
No, no, no!

507
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,020
Finn, you can't exert yourself like this.

508
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,060
Just take it easy.

509
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,190
I ran into a woman in the cafeteria.

510
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,210
Real nice. But seemed stressed.

511
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,070
Turns out that her boyfriend is having spinal surgery, too.

512
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,410
Big coincidence, huh?

513
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,660
But get this.

514
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,870
He also has pseudoachondroplasia.

515
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,330
I mean, what are the chances?

516
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,130
Nathalie, don't you dare.

517
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,630
Stop!

518
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,090
Just slow down.

519
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,220
You called me the love of your life!

520
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,530
I do love you!

521
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,510
Don't say that!

522
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,930
I don't want to hear any more of your garbage.

523
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,410
Please...

524
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,850
you have to...listen.

525
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,940
You need to get back to bed now, or you'll pass out.

526
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,960
What's up?

527
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,500
What are you doing in here?

528
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,900
Once you get a patient on the table,

529
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,420
there's too much going on to appreciate what this place is.

530
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,340
It's nice.

531
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,850
It's perfect.

532
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,390
Time to scrub in.

533
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,440
This will be my last surgery.

534
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
Five months ago,

535
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,200
I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.

536
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,990
I'm not responding to medication.

537
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,680
Why did you do that?

538
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,100
I felt like it.

539
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,810
It didn't change the fact that he cheated on you.

540
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,560
It won't make your life any better.

541
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,530
You can't control how you feel about someone.

542
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,900
But you can control what you do with those feelings.

543
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,530
I ended the relationship on my terms.

544
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,250
More importantly...

545
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,710
it made me feel better.

546
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,440
A Louisville Slugger to a Porsche?

547
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,050
It was insane.

548
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,050
I like her.

549
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,970
What is to like?

550
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,850
I don't know.

551
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,600
I just do.

552
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,750
A sudden complete loss of any SSEP and MEP signals.

553
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,370
B.P. and heart rate are tanking. We've injured his cord.

554
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,000
Push high-dose steroids and pressors.

555
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,030
Remove the retractor to take the pressure off.

556
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,660
That's the last of the vessels and nerves ligated.

557
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,450
Mayos.

558
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,210
Specimen bag.

559
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,640
We have healthy bone-anchor sites.

560
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,890
Same here.

561
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,350
Time to give him functional arms.

562
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,860
Not me. Give it to her.

563
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,010
She's a third-year resident --

564
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,970
a talented one, but I wouldn't --

565
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,170
I'm sure she's read every article written on osseointegration,

566
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,430
spent countless hours in the Skills Lab,

567
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,690
and could probably do this

568
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,840
with one of her own arms tied behind her back.

569
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:16,010
Blindfolded.

570
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,470
Get to work.

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,730
Push another milligram of atropine.

572
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,970
We may have just paralyzed him trying to avoid a stutter.

573
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,040
We won't know anything until we wake him up.

574
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,430
Where's the pressure still coming from?

575
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,220
Laterally now.

576
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,480
So if we remove the joints of the C1 and C2 bones,

577
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,650
that should make enough room

578
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:55,900
so we could drill off the odontoid.

579
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,360
We could replace them with screws and rods to stabilize his spine.

580
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,550
That's...

581
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,180
a good idea.

582
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,600
Yes, it is.

583
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,980
If he's not already paralyzed.

584
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,610
Colleen Brown.

585
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,860
Freshman year.

586
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,110
I took her to the roller-skating rink

587
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,870
'cause I thought that's what you're supposed to do --

588
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,800
take girls to the roller-skating rink.

589
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,200
I didn't know how to roller-skate,

590
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,500
she ended up leaving with Bobby K's little brother.

591
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,380
Broke me up.

592
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,170
Couldn't go to school for a week.

593
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:39,840
Convinced my mom that I was sick for the first three days,

594
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,530
and the last two I spent in a double feature all day --

595
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:45,280
"Where's Poppa?" and "Twelve Chairs."

596
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,310
To this day, I can quote both films verbatim.

597
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,490
So you think I should've stayed home

598
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,950
for two more days?

599
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,370
No, I don't think it would've mattered.

600
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,900
It doesn't make a difference.

601
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,000
And then I made a list

602
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,250
of all the things that annoyed me about her.

603
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,290
The way she chewed her gum,

604
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,800
the way she used to sit in the front row of every class

605
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,720
so that the teacher would call on her when she raised her hand,

606
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,660
the way she said, "Excuse me?" instead of just "What?" or "Huh?"

607
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,120
None of it makes any difference.

608
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,960
Then why are you telling me?

609
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,940
Maybe it'll make you feel a little bit better to know that,

610
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,070
what you're going through,

611
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,780
every other young man in the history of the world

612
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,180
has gone through.

613
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,910
You're trying to make it work with Lea and with Carly,

614
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,950
and you're getting a little beat up,

615
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,020
and that's okay.

616
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,600
Join the club.

617
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,960
You're in the mix.

618
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,190
That's a good thing.

619
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,690
I'm proud of you.

620
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,460
You ready?

621
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,670
It's gonna take some getting used to.

622
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,840
But they're the same nerves you used before.

623
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,900
All you have to do is think about using the arms

624
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,510
the way you normally would.

625
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,150
That's pretty cool.

626
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,740
It's not a beer,

627
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:31,490
but you got to start somewhere.

628
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,590
Now pinch your forefinger and thumb and twist off the cap.

629
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,980
I-I can't feel the thing.

630
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,700
You'll get used to it. You got this.

631
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:25,630
Nice.

632
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,640
You want me to say you were right?

633
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,020
About the patient, or you?

634
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,080
When you offered me a job,

635
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,230
you said it was to help me get back on the horse.

636
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,150
But what you really wanted was a mentor.

637
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,000
Which I'm fine with,

638
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,820
but I think maybe you feel threatened by that need.

639
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,820
Well, maybe that's true.

640
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,740
But maybe also you enjoy it a little too much.

641
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,510
Maybe because you're having a hard time

642
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,000
giving up being Chief.

643
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,670
Maybe we're both right.

644
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,670
How did it go?

645
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,550
Can you lift your arms for me?

646
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,690
Okay.

647
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:27,400
I'm gonna push your arm, and I need you to resist.

648
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,360
Good. More.

649
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,530
Stronger.

650
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,240
That's great.

651
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,200
You should make a full recovery.

652
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:38,450
Thank you.

653
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,790
H-how's Nathalie's hand?

654
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,890
There was no nerve or tendon damage.

655
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,170
She'll be fine.

656
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,050
She's a good person.

657
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,840
A little spirited, but that's what I loved about her.

658
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,260
Are you going to try to win her back?

659
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,140
I'm confident but not stupid.

660
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,980
You gotta know when to call it, Dr. Murphy.

661
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,540
I mean, there's a-a whole world

662
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,610
of amazing people out there.

663
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,530
Don't get bogged down with this notion of a soulmate.

664
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,460
Finn's exam was normal.

665
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,750
But I am not sure it was worth the risk.

666
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,170
We did a good thing today.

667
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,800
Mostly because of you.

668
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,180
That's kind of you to say but...

669
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,850
Your commitment to your patients...

670
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,400
reminds me of why I got into medicine.

671
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,360
Being around you makes me a better surgeon.

672
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,700
A better person.

673
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,290
Well, good night.

674
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,410
Good night.

675
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,720
You did good work today.

676
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,350
And I understand you're leaving surgery.

677
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,040
And I know that's a -- that's tough.

678
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,400
But it's the right call.

679
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,950
No, I don't think it is.

680
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,630
I love operating.

681
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,530
So I'm gonna keep doing it as long as I can.

682
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:47,880
I'm gonna have the synovectomy surgery.

683
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,420
That's really stupid.

684
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,590
That's incredibly... stupid.

685
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,340
Not every dream comes true.

686
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,530
You have other opportunities.

687
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,990
You have another chance.

688
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,450
Not everybody does. Be grateful for that.

689
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,230
Pick another passion and pursue that.

690
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,570
I'm doing the surgery.

691
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,050
Enjoy.

692
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,220
Another, please.

693
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:45,100
Well, that's one way to start the night off right.

694
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,560
Hello, Nurse Fletch.

695
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,110
You can call me Julie.

696
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:54,280
Are you here alone, or are you meeting someone?

697
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,440
I'm alone.

698
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,450
Well, to us.

699
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,910
You have beautiful eyes.

700
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,960
Thank you.

701
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,770
Or did someone just tell you that

702
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:19,590
that's a good opening line?

703
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,080
It's right in our backyard, and I've never even been there.

704
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,640
- Have you? - No.

705
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:33,400
It's, uh, time we unleash our inner tree-hugger.

706
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,670
You're off next weekend.

707
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,000
I think we should go to Yosemite.

708
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,900
What do you think?

709
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,320
Yeah, sounds fun.

710
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,410
I need to get me some hiking boots.

711
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,200
And, uh, like a fleece.

712
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,380
Beanie.

713
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,550
I'm rocking the full lumbersexual look.

714
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,640
'Cause I gotta blend in.

715
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,920
I hear a bear can spot a tourist a mile away.

716
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,090
You okay?

717
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,930
Uh, you're, uh --

718
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,010
you're here, but, you know, not.

719
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,370
You're right. I'm sorry.

720
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,450
It's -- it's just been a long week.

721
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,140
I'm a bit exhausted.

722
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,860
Yeah, I think I might call it an early night.

723
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,070
Oh, you sure?

724
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,210
I -- you know, we don't have to go to the club.

725
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,840
We can chill here. We can watch a movie.

726
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,280
I'm sorry. I just...

727
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,580
I just think I should go home.

728
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,660
Okay.

729
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,260
Shaun?

730
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,260
I want to smash your car up.

731
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,720
I think that's a bad idea.

732
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,650
I want to hurt you the way you hurt me.

733
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,420
I'm s-sorry.

734
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,320
You...

735
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:06,660
You...

736
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,290
You're...

737
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,550
I can't. 

738
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,890
I can't.

739
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,360
You acted like you cared about me...

740
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,240
...but you don't even respect me.

741
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,530
You're flaky.

742
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,540
And...

743
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,330
And you can't keep a boyfriend.

744
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,790
Ang you can't keep a job.

745
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,920
And no one likes you.

746
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,530
And -- and you're going to end up alone,

747
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,900
and you deserve it!

748
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,890
Because you're a superficial,

749
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:15,890
selfish, and prejudiced person!

750
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,540
You ready to tell me what's on your mind?

751
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,290
Not really.

752
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,180

753
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,060
I think I'm in love with my boss.
