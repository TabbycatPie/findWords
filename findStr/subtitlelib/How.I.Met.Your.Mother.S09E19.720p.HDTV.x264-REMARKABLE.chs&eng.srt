谢谢你带我来这里
Thank you for bringing me here.

13
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,630
幸好我们及时赶到
I am so glad we made it.

14
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,860
暴风雪越下越大了
That snowstorm was getting really bad.

15
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,560
你觉得这就算暴风雪了吗
Wait, you think this is a snowstorm?

16
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,100
这不算什么  我告诉你什么是真正的暴风雪
This is nothing. I'll tell you about a snowstorm.

17
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,000
大一那年的寒假
It was winter break, freshman year of college...

18
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,640
马修和我是室友  但是我们
Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't

19
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,110
-还不是好朋友  -等一下  打住
- really good friends yet. - Wait, stop.

20
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,550
这个故事你已经说过了
You've told me this one before.

21
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,580
说过了吗  什么时候
I have? When?

22
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,720
我想想啊
Uh, let's see. It was...

23
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,270
-整天听你说  -真的吗
- All the time. - Really?

24
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,130
你和马修开车回学校
You and Marshall drove back to school...

25
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,000
第2季第17集

26
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,890
一路单曲循环《五百英里》
"500 Miles" played on a loop.

27
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,330
你们选了一条小路  后来汽油没了
You took a back road, ran out of gas,

28
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,650
你们被困在暴风雪中  相拥取暖
got stuck in a snowstorm, spooned to stay warm--

29
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,920
至少你故事里是这么说的
at least that's your story--

30
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,390
最后你们成为了好朋友
and at the end of it, you were best friends.

31
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,540
好吧  没关系  不过你知道吗
Okay. Okay, that's fine, because guess what.

32
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,370
那还不算最严重的暴风雪
That wasn't even the worst snowstorm ever.

33
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,760
最严重的那年是2008年
It was 2008...

34
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,990
-巴尼和我  -当了一晚酒吧主人
- Barney and I... - Took over the bar,

35
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:52,220
遇见了亚利桑那州理工大学的行军乐队
met the Arizona Tech marching band--

36
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,270
"加油  母鸡队"
"Go Hens!"--

37
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,270
第4季第13集

38
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,610
马修去机场接莉莉的时候
And they played "Auld Lang Syne" when Marshall

39
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,130
他们还演奏了《友谊地久天长》
picked up Lily at the airport.

40
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,590
好吧
Okay.

41
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,330
我有跟你说过马修那次...
Have I told you about the time that Marshall...

42
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,360
想在莉莉祖父的房子上挂圣诞彩灯
tried to put Christmas lights on Lily's grandparents' house

43
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,360
第7季第12集

44
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,740
后来隔壁的熊孩子
And the little ragamuffin from next door

45
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,040
害他被困在房顶上了
left him stranded on the roof?

46
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
-莉莉告诉你的吗  -对
- Did Lily tell you that one? - Yeah.

47
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,580
"熊孩子"这词是莉莉说的
Lily used the word "ragamuffin."

48
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,550
看来我的故事都跟你说过了
So I've told you all my stories.

49
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,740
恐怕是  不过幸运的是
I'm afraid so. But luckily,

50
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,390
我还有大把你没听过的故事
I have plenty of stories that you don't know yet.

51
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,520
比如我和大学的室友
Like the one where my college roommates and I

52
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,660
跑去脱衣舞男吧
went to this male strip club...

53
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,680
你们的朋友"老二鼻"被一根老二
And your friend Dongnose got smacked on the nose

54
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,660
打到了鼻子
with a dong?

55
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,150
我听过了
I know that one.

56
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,750
好吧
Okay.

57
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,790
那说过为什么"老二鼻"叫...
What about the story that explains how...

58
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,550
"老二鼻"这个绰号吗
Dongnose got her nickname "Dongnose"

59
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,850
而且那与被老二扇到鼻子的事件完全没有关系吗
and that it had nothing to do with the dong-smacking incident?

60
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,220
听过了  很喜欢
Heard it, loved it,

61
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,370
我把它称为21世纪最精彩的巧合
called it the greatest coincidence of the 21st century.

62
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,120
我所有的故事你都听过了
You know every one of my stories.

63
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,380
我所有的故事你也听过了
And you know every one of mine.

64
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,300
这就正式说明
I guess it's official.

65
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,020
我们是老夫老妻了
We're an old married couple.

66
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,030
-太好了  -我们做到了
- Nice! - We did it!

67
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,720
这不是莫斯比夫妇嘛
Well, well, if it isn't the Mosbys.

68
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,930
来这里享受一个远离孩子们的浪漫周末
Here for a romantic weekend away from the kids.

69
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,920
幸好你们房间两边都没有住人
it's a good thing there's no guests on either side of you,

70
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,310
因为床垫的弹簧会像奶酪工厂的老鼠一样
'cause those bedsprings are gonna squeak like mice

71
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,220
吱吱叫个不停  对吧
in a cheese factory. Am I right?

72
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,740
千万别像你的朋友
Just don't break any of the lamps

73
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,570
巴尼和罗宾那样搞到打碎台灯  好吗
like your friends Barney and Robin, okay?

74
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,390
-其实事实并非如此  -当然不是
- That's not how the lamp broke. - Of course not.

75
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
好了  你们玩开心
All right, you have fun, you two.

76
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,570
什么台灯
What lamp is this?

77
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,880
婚礼那天罗宾打碎的台灯
The lamp Robin broke the day of the wedding.

78
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,420
天啊  这个故事你没听过
Oh, my god. You don't know this one.

79
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,460
我的老天
Oh, man.

80
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,690
这可是个好故事
This is a good one.

81
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,100
我是指什么刺激情节都有
I mean, it's got everything.

82
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,900
阴谋  背叛  台灯
Intrigue, betrayal, lamps.

83
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,630
这可是个跌宕起伏的故事  请系好安全带
It is a ripping yarn, so buckle your seatbelt.

84
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,880
-快讲故事  -好吧
- Just Tell the story. - Okay.

85
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,740
故事是这样的
Here goes.

86
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,650
罗宾打碎了一个台灯
Robin broke a lamp.

87
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,870
够了  不许玩了
Okay, this has to stop.

88
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,100
别啊  我们正玩得起劲呢
Come on, we're just having fun.

89
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,550
这是个漫长的周末
It has been a long weekend.

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,430
这是我放松的方式
This is how I relax.

91
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,290
是吗
Really?

92
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,690
这是你放松的方式吗
This is how you relax?

93
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,590
整个早上一个球都没进过吗
By not getting a single shot past me the entire morning?

94
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,220
你真逊  特布罗斯基  你打球像个老太太一样
You suck, Scherbatsky, you shoot like my grandma.

95
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,900
特布罗斯基  老虎的屁股你也敢摸
Okay, Scherbatsky, you just poked the dragon.

96
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,210
等着  新娘要发力了
Here comes the bride.

97
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,880
好了好了  不如我们
Okay, okay. How about we switch to an activity

98
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,900
换个更适合今天要
that's more suited to somebody who's,

99
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,690
结婚的人的活动  好吗
you know, getting married today?

100
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,380
我们要去喝一杯吗
We gonna go chug some Labatts?

101
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,850
不如我们喝一杯回忆的美酒吧
I was thinking we could chug some memories instead.

102
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,430
"巴尼和罗宾
"Barney & Robin:

103
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,520
永生永世的爱人
Lovers forever and ever and ever:

00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,130
爱情故事"
a love story."

105
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,400
听起来好俗气
Sounds cheesy.

106
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,560
我永生永世都要吐了
I'm gonna go barf forever and ever and ever.

107
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,050
再见啦  姐儿们
See you, hosers.

108
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,590
哪里俗气了
It's not cheesy.

109
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,570
瞧
See?

110
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,650
能告诉我住在九号房的客人是谁吗
Uh, can you tell me the name of the guest staying in room nine?

111
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,800
抱歉
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,020
这有违酒店的隐私政策
That would violate hotel privacy policy.

113
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,530
或许我的老朋友林肯先生
Well, maybe my old friend Mr. Lincoln...

114
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,530
五元钱上印的头像是林肯

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,530
能让你透露下信息
can emancipate that information.

116
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,650
抱歉  我没说清楚
I'm so sorry, I wasn't clear.

117
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,470
我不能违反酒店的隐私政策
I can't violate our hotel privacy policy.

118
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,500
就为了5美元
For five dollars.

119
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,120
上面有数字2的就可以了
Something with a two on it is fine.

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,890
这是少有的20美元  我是走运才能搞到这张呢
But those are super rare and the one I have is kind of lucky.

121
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,790
痛快点  莫斯比先生
Just give me a 20, Mr. Mosby.

122
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,310
那个房间住的是西衫・川上女士
That room belongs to a Ms. Susan Tupp.

123
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,720
我的老天
Oh, boy.

124
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,920
天啊  你太漂亮了
God, you're gorgeous.

125
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,150
我等不及要[穿]上你了
Oh, I can't wait to be inside you.

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,550
巴尼  快出来  今天可是你结婚的日子
Barney. Get out here, this is your wedding day.

127
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,620
-她在哪里  -谁
- Where is she? - Who?

128
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,260
我刚花了一大笔钱打听到
Look, I just grossly overpaid for some information

129
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,080
这个房间的住客  所以肯定是正确的
about this room, so I know it's accurate.

130
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,740
那个房间住的是西衫・川上
This room belongs to Susan Tupp.

131
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,800
谁
Who?

132
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,660
西衫・川上
Susan Tupp.

133
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,680
-谁  -西...
- Who? - Sue...

134
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,170
川上
Tupp.

135
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,510
-穿上西装  -我不正努力着吗
- Suit up. - I'm trying to.

136
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,090
我要你帮我挑一件
I need you to help me pick the suit

137
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,510
走结婚红毯时穿的西装
I'm gonna wear when I walk down the aisle.

138
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,140
要走红毯的是罗宾  你只需在尽头等着
Okay, Robin walks down the aisle, you wait at the end of it.

139
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,820
好吧  那就挑一身大家都站起来
Okay, then the suit I'll be wearing

140
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,380
迎接我进礼堂时穿的西装
when they all stand as I enter the chapel.

141
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,080
-那也是她  -是吗
- That's also her. - Really?

142
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,820
老天  男同胞在婚礼中
Man, the fellas sure do get boned

143
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,940
-真是一点地位都没有啊  -好了
- on the whole wedding thing, don't they? - Okay.

144
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,910
我们好好帮你挑一件吧
All right, well, let's, let's pick you a suit.

145
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,330
你最中意的是哪几件
What are... What are the top contenders?

146
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,210
经过仔细的考量
Well, after careful consideration,

147
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,430
我把选择目标缩小到了
I have narrowed it down to

148
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,070
这一排...
these ones...

149
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,400
和这一排...
and these ones...

150
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,350
以及这房间里所有剩下的
and the other ones in this room

151
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,090
和隔壁房间里的所有的西服
and all the ones in the adjoining room.

152
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,800
所以你把范围缩小到你所有的西装上了
So you've narrowed it down to all your suits.

153
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,350
没错  我们死定了
Yeah, we're screwed.

154
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,470
这张照片是你和巴尼
And this is a picture of the restaurant

155
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,140
在第一次约会的餐厅
where you and Barney had your first date.

156
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,310
现在你俩都要结婚了
And now you're getting married.

157
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,840
这张是你和巴尼
And this is the receipt from the meal

158
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,630
第一次约会时的用餐收据
you and Barney ate at that restaurant on your first date.

159
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,570
现在你俩都要结婚了
And now you're getting married.

160
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,240
我们待会儿再看好吗
Can we look at this later?

161
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,610
待会  哪里还有待会
Later? There is no later.

162
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,130
罗宾  今天这日子一生只有一次
Robin, this is a day you only get to do once.

163
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:38,740
你应该马上认识到它的重要性
You need to appreciate the importance of it right now.

164
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,660
我的天
Oh, my God.

165
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,130
我怎么到现在才意识到
How did I only just now realize this?

166
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,180
姐们儿  这家旅馆的点播台
Dude, this hotel has the Wedding Bride 2

167
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,410
有《新娘快跑》第二集呢
on pay-per-view.

168
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,930
《新娘快跑》第二集之蜜月迷情  售价14.99

169
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,900
中大奖啦
Score.

170
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,620
这真是我人生中最开心的一天呀
This is the best day of my life!

171
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,270
我知道罗宾不是特别女性化的女人
I mean, I know Robin's not the girliest girl,

172
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,200
可原以为到了结婚的那一天
but you'd think on her wedding day,

173
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,360
她至少会有点多愁善感吧
she'd be at least a little sentimental.

174
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,310
每个人处理婚礼的方式都不一样
Everyone deals with getting married differently.

175
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,730
我理了一个我认为是史上最难看的头发
I got what I thought was the worst haircut ever.

176
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,020
直到我帮自己修剪出了真正最难看的头发
Till I fixed it with the actual worst haircut ever.

177
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,440
所以我们才有了史上最难看的婚礼照片
Which led to the worst wedding photos ever.

178
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,200
但至少你结婚那天有被吓昏头
But at least you had a wedding day freak-out.

179
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,340
宝贝  不要担心
Baby, Don't worry.

180
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,920
用不了多久  罗宾就会被
Any minute now, Robin's gonna get smacked in the face

181
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,330
"天啊  今天我结婚"的事吓得惊慌失措
with her own "holy crap, this is my wedding" moment,

182
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,480
她绝对会吓得上蹿下跳  我保证
and then she's gonna wedding out all over the place. I promise.

183
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,650
可这事不能着急  必须顺其自然
But you can't force it, it has to just happen.

184
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,830
她一看到点播台有《新娘快跑》第二集
Mm, I don't know. I mean, she bailed on my scrapbook

185
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,680
就把我的剪贴簿丢到一边去了
when she found out the Wedding Bride 2 Is on pay-per-view.

186
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,640
点播台有《新娘快跑》第二集吗
The wedding bride 2 is on pay-per-view?!

187
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,840
打扰一下
I'm sorry, did...

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,090
你们是不是在聊《新娘快跑》
Did I hear you guys talking about the Wedding Bride?

189
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,730
-又来了  -你们是在说电影还是
- Oh, God. - The movie or the...

190
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,350
轰动一时的百老汇歌舞剧
smash broadway musical?

191
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,230
轰动  现在一部只上演了
Smash? Oh, oh, oh, I-I guess a show's a smash now

192
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,080
96周的戏也可以算轰动了  是吧
if it closes after only 96 weeks.

193
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,270
《新娘快跑》是我老公的
So my husband's ex-fiance's husband

194
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,390
前女友的老公写的剧本
wrote the screenplay for the wedding bride.

195
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,190
"杰德・莫斯理"就是以泰德为原型的
"Jed Mosley" was based on Ted.

196
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,160
杰德的原型不是我
Okay, Jed was not based on me...

197
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,330
那可不是玩具  熊孩子
That is not a toy, you ragamuffin.

198
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,530
那是我在文艺复兴大会上赢的货真价实的流星锤
That is an authentic flail I won at the renaissance fair.

199
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,120
不完全是
...Entirely.

200
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,020
但不管怎样
But, regardless, there's...

201
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,710
我心里还是有挥之不去的伤痛
there's still some lingering pain there and...

202
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,550
你大概也可以理解
well, as you can imagine,

203
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,190
我的朋友们都答应我永远不会看这电影
my friends promised me that they'd never watch it.

204
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,510
他们真是够义气
Those are some good friends.

205
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,720
他们是最棒的
Oh, they're the best.

206
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,340
我的小弟弟
My wiener!

207
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,430
真不敢相信杰德要我们发誓不看这电影
I can't believe Jed made us promise not to watch this.

208
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,640
等等  你是想说泰德吧
Wait, you mean Ted.

209
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,960
无所谓了  都是同一个人
Whatever. Same guy.

210
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,310
我还以为你会有一套为了婚礼
See, I would have expected you to have an extra-special suit

211
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,780
特意找裁缝做的西服
tailor-made just for this occasion.

212
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,650
我有啊
Oh, I did.

213
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,120
蒂姆・古恩  《天桥霓裳》顾问

214
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,120
我的兄弟蒂姆・古帮我做了一套完美的西装
I had my boy Timmy G make the perfect wedding suit.

215
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
你听说过"量身定做"吗
You ever heard of "bespoke"?

216
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,450
这件西装简直是"百里挑一  美轮美奂"
This suit was be-freaking-screamed.

217
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,990
可我今早试穿的时候
But then I tried it on this morning

218
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,190
那西服特别不舒服  又痒又不合身
and it was uncomfortable and itchy and completely wrong.

219
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,950
就像是专门给体形难看
It was like a suit made for someone with terrible posture,

220
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,200
没品钱少的人做的
no taste and limited funds.

221
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,790
来  给你吧
Here, you take it.

222
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,250
剩下的问题就是
The only question is,

223
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,810
其他件西装里我该挑哪一件呢
which of these other suits do I pick?

224
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,110
好衣服太多  难以抉择啊
There are so many great ones to choose from.

225
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,710
这一件怎么样
Uh, how about this one?

226
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,580
很好  很好  就这件了
Yes. Yes, that's the one.

227
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,420
问一下  我曾经穿着它上了一个马术女小丑
Oh, hey, quick question: Is it weird to get married in a suit

228
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,460
现在再穿着它结婚  会不会很奇怪
that you may have worn while banging a female rodeo clown?

229
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,400
我知道你在想什么
I know what you're wondering.

230
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,550
没错  上面的头发和下面的"头发"颜色一样
Yes, the carpet matched the drapes.

231
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,430
当然很奇怪  每一个细节都很奇怪
Of course that's weird. Every part of that is weird.

232
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,780
那么  这一件怎么样
Uh, what about this suit? Huh?

233
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,050
我曾经在这件西装里"塞了不少小兔子"
Let's just say I stuffed a lot of bunnies in that suit.

234
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,880
巴尼  你非得说得这么淫秽吗
Ugh, Barney, do you have to phrase it that way?

235
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,110
是真的小兔子  泰德  这是我的魔术服
Actual bunnies, Ted. This is my magic suit.

236
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,680
你的思想不要那么龌龊好吗
Get your mind out of the gutter.

237
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,990
不过  我的确穿着它参加过花花公子的派对
Though, I did once wear it to the playboy holiday party and, uh...

238
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,880
我曾经穿这件西装"塞"了不少"兔女郎"呢
Let's just say I stuffed a lot of bunnies in that suit.

239
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,940
-那这一件呢  -天啊
- How about this one? - Oh, man,

240
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,860
我穿着它和一个"伴游"玩得可疯狂了
I went crazy on an escort in that one.

241
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,200
巴尼  够了
Barney, come on.

242
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,540
是福特的伴游车  泰德我是在车上搞的
A Ford Escort, Ted, I did it on a car.

243
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,590
和一个我可能付了钱可能没付钱的伴游妹
With a woman who I then may or may not have paid.

244
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,000
所以这一件也不行
Yeah, that one's out, too.

245
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,040
你的婚礼几小时后就要开始了
Okay, so your wedding's in a few hours.

246
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,140
现在还在看这么糟糕的电影
Kind of strange to spend those hours

247
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,800
有点太奇怪了吧
watching a terrible movie, right?

248
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,720
糟糕  莉莉  这电影简直是意外的惊喜
Terrible? Lily, this movie is a revelation.

249
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,720
真不敢相信泰德一直不准我们看呢
I can't believe that Ted wouldn't let us see it.

250
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,400
是啊  他为什么对这部电影这么不满
Yeah. Why was he hanging so much beef on this movie?

251
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,440
就因为有个角色的原型是他吗
Just 'cause there's a character based on him?

252
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,670
对了  我要让所有婚礼都违法
Of course. I'll make all weddings illegal.

253
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,390
这样斯黛拉就永远当不成新娘了
Then Stella can never be a wedding bride.

254
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,130
不行就是不行  小宝贝
No-can-I-do's-ville, baby doll.

255
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,260
我想说  "放轻松  泰德
It's like, "relax, Ted,

256
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,760
没什么大不了  你应该感到荣幸好吗"
It's no big deal. You should be flattered."

257
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,120
现在我要拿出珍藏已久的巧克力蛋糕
And now to celebrate with that piece of chocolate cake

258
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,350
来庆祝一下啦
I've been saving.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,240
什么  谁吃了我的蛋糕
What?! Who ate my cake?!

260
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,730
什么蛋糕
Uh, what cake?

261
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,200
奶修
Narshall!

262
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,340
奶修
Narshall?

263
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,360
奶修  好大的胆子啊
Narshall. How dare they?

264
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,570
那简直是又无礼又荒谬
That is insulting and ridiculous

265
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,150
我跟那个角色根本不一样
and I am nothing like that character.

266
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,050
我要起诉与参与这部电影的所有有关人员
I'm gonna sue everyone involved with this film.

267
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,350
所以你起诉他们的理由是
So, you're-you're gonna sue them on the grounds that

268
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,680
那块蛋糕般的事情从未发生过吗
nothing like that cake thing has ever happened?

269
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,630
要是泰德不希望我吃那块蛋糕
If Ted didn't want me to eat that cake,

270
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,600
就应该在上面写张卡片
he should have put a note on it.

271
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,990
-外婆好  -罗宾  亲爱的
- Oh, hi, grandma. - Robin, sweetheart.

272
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,800
我想把这个给你
I wanted you to have this.

273
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,980
是我和你外公结婚时的照片
It's me and your grandpa on our wedding day.

274
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,990
好窝心啊
Aw, that's so sweet.

275
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,410
看到我的捧花了吗
See my bouquet?

276
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,460
这些野花...
Those wildflowers--

277
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,400
本应该是绣球花的
They were supposed to be hydrangeas,

278
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,730
但是花店那边出了点状况
but there was a mix-up at the florist's.

279
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,230
我当时好生气
I was so upset.

280
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,910
你外公就去教堂后面
Your grandpa went behind the church

281
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,950
摘了这些野花给我
and picked those wildflowers for me.

282
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,840
-而现在他被埋在了...  -同家教堂后面
- And now he's buried... - Behind the very same church,

283
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,690
他的坟墓被同样的野花环绕着
surrounded by the very same wildflowers.

284
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,310
外婆  我们在看电影  先这样啦
Okay, grandma, watching a movie. Got to go.

285
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,480
每个假期  我外婆都给我讲这个烂故事
Every single holiday, that same dumb story.

286
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,240
抱歉外婆  这故事没你想得那么感人
Sorry, grandma, not as touching as you think it is.

287
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,320
就在同家教堂后面吗
At the very same church.

288
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,030
现在我们来看看
Now, I want to see

289
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,310
杰德能否从那个保温瓶里拿出那根香肠
if Jed can get his wiener unstuck from that thermos.

290
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
不行就是不行  小宝贝
No-can-do's-ville, baby doll.

291
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,080
不好意思  请问你这是
Uh, I'm sorry. Did you just

292
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,310
在婚礼当天不让新娘好好看电影吗
turn off the bride's tv on her wedding day?

293
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,800
是吗  今天你结婚啊
Oh! Oh! Is this your wedding day?

294
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,080
抱歉  完全看不出来
I'm sorry. I couldn't tell

295
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,890
你表现得好像今天就是一个普通的周日
because you're acting like it's any other Sunday morning,

296
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,490
但其实不是
and it's not.

297
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,630
莉莉  如果你一直在等着
Lily, if you're waiting for me to suddenly turn

298
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,140
我会变成待嫁小女子 你还是放弃吧
into th-th-the wedding bride, you just give up.

299
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,850
-我就不是那种人  -好吧
- That's just not me. - Fine.

300
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,190
也许我们都应该不把这场婚礼当回事
Maybe we should all just act like this wedding's no big deal.

301
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,440
我甚至都不想穿上那套伴娘礼服
Maybe I don't even feel like wearing my bridesmaid's dress.

302
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,900
很好  不就是一场婚礼吗
Great. It-it's just a wedding.

303
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,180
没有人会在意穿着
Who cares what people wear?

304
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,380
-就穿这件吧  -对不起  我做不到
- Say yes to the suit! - I can't! I can't.

305
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,240
太好了  因为我刚好准备了另一套裙子
Great. Because I actually brought a different dress

306
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,070
-正想试试看呢  -好啊
- that I'd like to wear. - Fine.

307
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,740
不是吧
Oh, no.

308
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,150
不如我现在就去换上吧
Maybe I'll go put it on right now.

309
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,730
-去吧  -怎么了
- Go right ahead. - What?

310
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,880
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

311
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,210
什么  怎么了
What, why?

312
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,240
-这个故事我也听过  -真的吗
- I know this story, too. - Really?

313
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,080
对  罗宾和莉莉大吵了一架
Yeah. Robin and Lily get in a big fight

314
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,580
几分钟后  有人敲门
and then, a few minutes later, there's a knock at the door.

315
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,100
你好啊
Hello.

316
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,300
-我以前给你讲过这个  -讲过几次吧
- I've told you this one before. - A few times.

317
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,590
我现在就是
I'm just...

318
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,680
一个总是讲老掉牙故事的无聊老男人
a boring old man who won't stop spinning yarns.

319
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,300
别这么说  我很喜欢听你的故事
Oh, hey. I love your yarns.

320
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,770
我很希望你一直这样讲下去
I hope you never stop spinning them.

321
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,160
但是...
But...

322
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,650
你是我一生挚爱  泰德熊
You're the love of my life, pooh bear.

323
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,380
我只是担心你
I just worry about you.

324
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:39,800
我不希望你变成一个活在过去里的人
I don't want you to be the guy who lives in his stories.

325
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,180
人生只能向前走  不能回头
Life only moves forward.

326
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,600
那后来怎么样了
So what happens next?

327
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,060
我是说莉莉和婚纱的事
With Lily and the wedding dress, I mean.

328
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,830
是这样  她带了那套裙子
Well... She brought the dress

329
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,270
是为了和马修重新拍几张婚纱照
so that she and Marshall could get new wedding photos taken.

330
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,390
因为在我听过的另一个故事里...
Because in yet another story that I know...

331
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,110
不要啊
No!

332
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,410
要不是这些故事占了这么多空间
What kind of space would I have in my brain

333
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:07,170
我的脑子里能放多少东西啊
for other things if I didn't know all this?

334
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,020
算了  说不定也就记点无聊的东西
Eh, probably just state birds or some crap.

335
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,210
莉莉想借用一下罗宾的摄影师
So, uh, Lily wanted to borrow Robin's photographer.

336
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,550
应该没什么问题
That shouldn't be a problem.

337
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,270
没什么问题  罗宾
Shouldn't be A problem, Robin?

338
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,210
这当然有问题
Of course it should be a problem.

339
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,600
今天是你的婚礼啊
This is your wedding.

340
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,180
你不能让别人借用你的摄影师
You can't let somebody borrow your photographer.

341
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,800
别担心  她是开玩笑的  罗宾
Don't worry. She's not serious, Robin.

342
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,190
当时我们婚礼时那套西装  我没带着
I didn't even bring the suit that I wore to our wedding.

343
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,000
你带了  在房间里放着呢
Yes, you did. It's in our room.

344
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,880
去穿上  我们一定要拍
Go put it on. We're doing this.

345
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,480
罗宾  既然你不介意的话
And, Robin, since you don't seem to care,

346
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,690
那我就穿着这套婚纱去参加婚礼啦
I think I'll be wearing this to the ceremony.

347
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,990
-好  -好
- Fine! - Fine!

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,070
好
Fine.

349
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,040
这问题有很简单的解决方法
There's a very simple solution here.

350
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
我们面对现实吧
We might as well just face it.

351
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,220
海军陆战队结婚时必须穿军服  所以...
U.S. Marines have to get married in uniform, so...

352
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,450
我要去参军了
I'll just go enlist.

353
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,930
兄弟
Dude,

354
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,920
我们可以一起参军  那是我们的梦想
we can enlist together! That's the dream!

355
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,860
-这算什么梦想  -不知道能不能自己选室友
- That's not the... - I wonder if they let you pick bunkmates.

356
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,650
但愿可以吧
I hope they do.

357
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,870
虽然我可能会要单间房  你会交到朋友的
Although I might want to request a single. You'll make friends.

358
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,710
真是够了
Look, enough of this.

359
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,390
蒂姆给你做了这么棒的西服
Tim made you this amazing suit.

360
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,650
穿上
Put it on.

361
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,730
感觉好奇怪
This feels weird.

362
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,220
因为是新西服
That's because it's new.

363
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,270
从来没被人穿过的西服
It's a suit that's never been worn before,

364
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,370
你甚至做梦都没想到会穿上它
A suit you never dreamed you'd wear.

365
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,690
与这套西服有关的记忆还没有发生
All of this suit's memories are still ahead of it.

366
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,950
你想象一下
Look, picture it, huh?

367
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,370
婚礼现场
The ceremony.

368
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,050
-众人为我起立吗  -是为新娘起立
- When everyone stands up for me? - They do that for her.

369
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,180
应该的
They should.

370
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,810
她会犹如仙女下凡
She's gonna look amazing.

371
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,860
当然是这样
You'd better believe it.

372
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,090
她走向圣坛
She walks down the aisle,

373
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,280
你们说出婚誓
you say your vows,

374
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,480
然后去婚宴
you go to the reception,

375
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,870
跳起婚后第一支舞
you have your first dance.

376
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,940
在不知不觉间  就像魔法一样
And before you know it, just like magic,

377
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,210
你发现
you realize...

378
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,930
这是最完美的选择
It's a perfect fit.

379
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,230
你说得对  泰德
You're right, Ted.

380
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,510
就是它[她]了
This is the one.

381
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,310
谢谢
Thanks.

382
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,050
那么
So...

383
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,330
皮带
Belts.

384
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,940
莉莉  好漂亮的婚纱
Hey, Lil. Nice dress.

385
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,600
你俩真是天生一对
you two were made for each other.

386
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,940
难道没人在乎我穿着婚纱吗
Like, does no one care that I'm wearing this dress?

387
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,080
我在乎
I care.

388
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,890
好了  没事了
Okay. Now you're good.

389
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,740
听着
Okay, look,

390
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,160
我知道今天是你们的大喜之日
I know this is your wedding, but this is

391
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,520
但今天对我们来说都很重要
a big moment for all of us.

392
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,150
这也许是我们所有人最后一次相聚
This may be the last time we're all hanging out together

393
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,030
下次再见谁知道是什么时候
for who knows how long.

394
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,010
明天一早
I mean, tomorrow morning,

395
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,420
泰德就要去芝加...
Ted's leaving for Chicag...

396
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,230
-糟糕  -莉莉
- Oh, boy. - Lily.

397
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,740
慢着  你已经知道了
Wait, you already know.

398
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,450
你已经知道了
You already know.

399
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,200
你娶了莉莉  这意味着
You're married to Lily, which means...

400
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,420
你告诉她时  她就用口袋做掩护发短信给我了
She pocket-texted me while you were telling her.

401
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,270
那么
So...

402
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,390
大家都知道  我明天要搬去芝加哥
Everybody knows I'm moving to Chicago tomorrow.

403
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,560
莉莉是对的
Lily's right.

404
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,820
我们不知道下次何时再聚
We don't know the next time that we'll all be together.

405
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,190
然后我想大家都意识到
And then I think it hit all of us.

406
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,620
我们不知道下次何时再聚
We didn't know the next time we'd be together.

407
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,250
就是这样了
This was it.

408
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,060
很好笑
And it's funny.

409
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,180
在那样的时刻
In a moment like that,

410
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,120
要面对的事情太过情绪化时
when what's really happening is too intense to deal with,

411
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,970
有时候最好就是
sometimes it's best...

412
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,250
一切尽在不言中
To leave it unspoken

413
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,650
把握最后相聚的快乐时刻
and just enjoy each other's company instead.

414
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,050
我一直想看这部电影
You know, I've been wanting to see this movie.

415
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,470
太棒了  电影时间到
Yes, movie time.

416
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,250
新娘在婚礼前
So it's not bad luck for the...

417
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,270
看到新郎的礼服  会不会带来噩运啊
bride to see the groom in his wedding suit?

418
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,830
不会的
No, I think it's fine.

419
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,320
-好帅气的领带  -谢谢
- Nice tie. - Thanks.

420
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,770
我差点就选了一条浅蓝色的
There was a cornflower blue one I almost went with.

421
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,960
那会让你的眼睛更漂亮
That would've brought out your eyes.

422
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,260
你不止带了一条领带对吗
You brought more than one tie, right?

423
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,820
我想尽量少带点行李嘛
I was trying to pack light.

424
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,200
这样吧  也许
Hey, you know what, maybe the,

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,520
伴郎团应该去吃点东西
uh, groomsmen should go get some food.

426
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,400
我不想让泰德忍受这部电影
I don't want Ted to have to sit through this movie.

427
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,140
太感谢了  奶修
I appreciate that, Narshall.

428
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,530
你不是吧  该死的
Really? Aw, damn it.

429
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,090
抱歉  我在飞机上看了
Sorry, I saw it on a plane.

430
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,380
这么说现在这个成槽点了吗
What, so this is gonna be, like, a thing now?

431
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,620
就是槽点了  奶修  对吗
Yeah, It's gonna be a thing now, Narshall. Right?

432
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,500
-奶修  -哥们
- Narshall. - Dude,

433
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,700
淡定  斯瓦尼
settle down, Swarley.

434
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,180
没错  斯瓦尼・西伦  放轻松
Yeah. Yeah, Swarlize Theron, take it easy.

435
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,450
我今天结婚  给点面子好吗
Man, this was supposed to be my special day.

436
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,950
我们熬过暴风雪了
Hey, we survived the storm!

437
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,710
奶修  是你干的好事吗
Oh, Narshall, did you do that?

438
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,980
不  不是我
Nope. Wasn't me.

439
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,100
那是谁啊
Well, then who was it?

440
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,550
大猩猩  大猩猩
A gorilla! Gorilla!

441
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,810
泰德真碰到这种事了吗
So that really happened to Ted?

442
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,150
这是真事
That is exactly what went down.

443
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,720
证据确凿
Chapter and verse.

444
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,520
-没有冰块了  -我去拿
- Out of ice. - I'll get it.

445
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,050
不用  我去  你坐
Oh, no. Got it. Sit down.

446
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,290
而且自动贩卖机投币口松了
Plus, the, uh, vending machine's got a loose coil.

447
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,520
我要去用屁股猛撞几下
I'm gonna try to hip check my way

448
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,340
弄些免费的彩虹糖
into some free tropical skittles.

449
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,350
你姐姐和大多数新娘不同  对吗
Your sister's not like most brides, is she?

450
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,500
她是特布罗斯基家的人  才不会因为结婚
She's a Scherbatsky. She's not gonna lose her timbits

451
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,500
timbit是著名的加式点心

452
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,130
就大乱阵脚惊慌失措呢
just 'cause she's getting married.

453
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,310
我想有些人就是不可能拥有
I guess some people just never have that

454
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,920
"哎呀妈呀  我要结婚了"这种时刻
"Holy crap, this is my wedding" moment.

455
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,670
妈
Mom?

456
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,420
故事就是这样
That's the story.

457
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,350
有一个意外的结局
Right down to the surprise ending.

458
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,650
这真的是意外吗
Is that really such a surprise?

459
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,170
得了吧
I mean, come on.

460
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,380
她当然会去
Yeah, of course she showed up.

461
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,680
什么样的母亲会错过女儿的婚礼
What mother is gonna miss her daughter's wedding?

462
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,020
别  别这样
No. Come on.

463
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,840
没事  没关系  我很好
It's okay. I'm fine. I'm okay.

464
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,410
巴尼真的穿着潜水服进了酒吧吗
Did Barney really wear a scuba suit into the bar?

465
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,250
这个故事我跟你讲过无数遍了
I've told you that story a million times.

466
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,740
但巴尼从哪里弄到的潜水服
Yeah, but where did Barney get the scuba suit?

467
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,100
他偷的
He stole it.

468
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,870
什么
What?

469
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,680
是的
Yeah.

470
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,610
真不敢相信我忘了
I can't believe I forgot that.

471
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,810
他走进体育用品店
He... Walked right into a sporting goods store,

472
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:08,110
试穿了潜水服  大摇大摆地从大门走了
tried on a scuba suit, and walked right out the door.

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,030
走了20条街回到家
Walked all the way home in it, like, 20 blocks.

穿着潜水服的人

475
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,910
走在百老汇大街上
just walking down Broadway.

476
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,480
他应该坐牢
He should be in prison.

477
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,670
对  他坐牢的原因可多了
Well, yeah, for lots of reasons.

478
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,020
-我们中最会偷东西的是莉莉  -不是吧
- You know, the thief of the group is Lily. - No.

479
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,380
-我的天  莉莉  -"她偷了我的心"那种
Yes. Oh, my god. Lily... No. She stole my heart.

480
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,220
不  我告诉你  莉莉
No, n-no, I'm telling you, Lily,

481
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,090
比方说...
from like, uh...

482
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,610
鲍勃・迪伦 《若你遇见她 代我问声好》
