21
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,220
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

22
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,650
Is there something you're not telling me?

23
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,850
When we're in meetings together,

24
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,900
don't ever call my ideas "Ridiculous."

25
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,400
Come on. I'm being serious.

26
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,250
So am I.

27
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,130
Merrill's son asked for personal advice.

28
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,060
- And he picked you. - I know, right?

29
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,120
A surgeon needs to communicate. Can Dr. Murphy do that?

30
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,200
Can he do that under stress?

31
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,730
Can he do that knowing that a human life

32
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,510
literally hangs in the balance?

33
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,870
Thank you, Dr. Kalu.

34
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,830
You're welcome. It's a special blend.

35
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,350
I roast the beans myself.

36
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,320
Smells like leather.

37
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,420
Then none for you, Murphy.

38
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,370
I don't drink coffee.

39
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,970
It is dead in here.

40
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,130
That's why they call it the graveyard shift.

41
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,020
Oh, well, I call it paradise. You my trauma virgins?

42
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,060
Ah, Doctors Murphy, Kalu, Browne --

43
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,610
meet Dr. Audrey Lim,

44
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,200
your attending for the evening.

45
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:53,860
Coffee?

46
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,740
He roasts the beans himself.

47
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,920
Kiss ass.

48
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,050
E.R.

49
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,820
How long? Got it.

50
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,890
Listen up, everybody!

51
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,340
We got a mass cas coming in.

52
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,280
It's a bus crash, two dozen passengers.

53
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,450
Transfer all patients waiting for beds up to the nursing units.

54
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,130
Have maintenance bring down cots.

55
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,180
We're gonna convert the waiting room into triage.

56
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,110
No one goes home till we're all clear!

57
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,770
Page everyone on call. I don't care what department they are.

58
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,610
Tonight, everybody's trauma. Glove up and line up.

59
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,210
EMTs will have triaged onsite,

60
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,170
so the patients are gonna come in tagged.

61
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,400
I love these blank faces right before Armageddon.

62
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,960
Trauma color coding -- who knows it?

63
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,030
Green -- walking wounded. Yellow -- observation.

64
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,330
Red needs immediate attention.

65
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,960
And black go straight to the morgue.

66
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,650
All right, red tags, front of the line!

67
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,040
Red tags, front of the line.

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,980
Wedding bus blew a tire and flipped!

69
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,400
26-year-old female.

70
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,230
Second- and third-degree burns to her neck, chest, and left arm.

71
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,350
Kalu, you're up.

72
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,560
Trauma Six.

73
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,390
Guy was ejected 30 feet from the vehicle.

74
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,410
Multiple chest contusions,

75
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,940
acute respiratory distress on the scene,

76
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,140
sluggish pupillary response.

77
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,810
- How long have you been doing CPR? - 12 minutes.

78
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,080
- Have you shocked him? - Three times.

79
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,860
We got to crack him. Dr. Browne, I got this.

80
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,970
You take the next one. All right, Bay Five.

81
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,470
We secured the foreign object and staunched the bleeding,

82
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,190
but didn't want to touch it otherwise.

83
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,030
- Good thing. It nicked her carotid. - What is it?

84
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,520
Right now it's a little Dutch boy keeping her from bleeding out.

85
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,830
Pulse ox is dropping. She's at 87.

86
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,070
O2 sats down to 83.

87
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,640
Forget about the neck, Claire.

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,770
Treat her like any other patient.

89
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,970
What are the first steps?

90
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,750
Airway, breathing, circulation.

91
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,260
Good. Grab a kit.

92
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,390
I need help here! Somebody, help!

93
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,370
Murphy, go!

94
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,220
Let's go.

95
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,350
Trauma Three.

96
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,470
I can't stop the bleeding.

97
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,440
- He's bleeding out. - Do something.

98
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:01,760
I need a urinary catheter, 14-gauge needle,

99
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,650
arterial guide wire, occlusion balloon,

100
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,190
and 20 cc of saline, stat.

101
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,880
- What's he doing? - I have no idea.

104
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,260
A what?

105
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,600
REBOA
A REBOA.

106
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,590
Is that even a word?

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,090
A REBOA will occlude the damaged artery and stop the bleeding.

108
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,600
Release the pressure.

109
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,610
BP is stabilizing. 90 over 60.

110
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,290
Nice work, Dr. Murphy.

111
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,910
I made a REBOA.

112
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,770
Oxygen is dropping to 89.

113
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,690
All right. Light.

114
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,450
Open wide for me.

115
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,430
Throat's swollen from smoke inhalation.

116
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,200
Cric kit.

117
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,390
- Do you see soot in her mouth or nose? - No.

118
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,710
She doesn't need a cric. She needs an escharotomy.

119
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,300
Sats are going back up. 92 and rising.

120
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,730
Circumferential neck burns.

121
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,530
The shrinking charred skin is acting like a noose.

122
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,680
Escharotomy relieves the constriction.

123
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you getting enough air now, ma'am?

124
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,970
Yes. Thank you.

125
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,390
Now get her out of this petri dish

126
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,740
and into an isolation ward in the burn unit ASAP.

127
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,540
Yes, sir.

128
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,830
Your heart's a bit muffled.

129
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,720
Am I having a heart attack?

130
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,610
No, but it's not completely good news.

131
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,710
Cardiac tamponade.

132
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,010
He needs a pericardiocentesis.

133
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,600
Yes, I'm aware of that.

134
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,320
18-gauge and 55 cc syringe, please.

135
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,120
We need a FAST ultrasound in here.

136
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,260
They're both in use.

137
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,550
You don't have imaging. You could puncture his heart.

138
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,530
Is the xiphoid in the same place as it was 20 years ago?

139
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,870
REBOA
A REBOA.

140
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,820
Ballsy.

141
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,520
Could've gone really wrong.

142
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,250
Yes, well, it didn't.

143
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,710
It's a cowboy move --

144
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,640
something you would never even dream of trying.

145
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,800
How many times is Shaun gonna have to prove himself

146
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,290
before you give him a shot?

147
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,770
Dr. Rolendez, O.R. 6.

148
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,620
What happened in the E.R.?

149
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,050
Swan girl came in and you hesitated.

150
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,370
I wasn't hesitating. I was thinking of a game plan.

151
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,390
Murphy was thinking of the game plan.

152
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,750
You got overwhelmed.

153
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,250
I wasn't.

154
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,190
First trauma, it happens.

155
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,210
You have to think clearly, quickly, methodically.

156
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,180
You need to think a little more like Shaun.

157
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,640
A little more. Not identically.

158
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,190
How you doing?

159
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,900
Sorry.

160
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,790
Sorry. That's a stupid question.

161
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,030
You're maxed out on morphine.

162
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,090
I'll hold off until it reloads.

163
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,580
How bad is it?

164
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,010
We're making good progress.

165
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,410
I'll have to... debride any deroofed blisters

166
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,850
to prevent a secondary nosocomial and then --

167
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,910
I need a mirror.

168
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,620
It's the least you can do

169
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,660
since you can't even look me in the eye.

170
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,610
Oh, my God.

171
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:56,740
Do you know how many hideous $300 bridesmaid dresses

172
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,070
I've had to buy in the last two years?

173
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,750
I decided that when I got married,

174
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,990
my bridesmaids are gonna wear black cocktail dresses

175
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,520
so they can use them again, you know?

176
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,460
But now...

177
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,330
now I-I'm Freddy Krueger.

178
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,350
Who's gonna want to marry this?

179
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,350
I'm gonna find a nurse,

180
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,990
have her adjust your... your morphine drip.

181
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,040
Okay.

182
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,560
You hit your face.

183
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,220
Your jaw got stuck. It hurts.

184
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,210
So, this shot I just gave you is gonna knock you out

185
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,300
so that I can fix that.

186
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,150
Hang tight.

187
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,830
- Crash patients status check? - 23 people total.

188
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,020
One fatality on site, lost one in the E.R.

189
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,920
Examined all the red tags.

190
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,100
Got 13 yellow and green still in the waiting room.

191
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,550
- I'll take whoever's up next. - Marco Magallenes...

192
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,370
severed femoral artery, crushed femur.

193
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:00,500
I did the REBOA and then installed a temporary shunt.

194
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,230
Here are his CT and MRI results.

195
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,690
Find someone else for whoever's up next.

196
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,530
Oh, finally.

197
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,710
Excuse me. Are you Marco's family?

198
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,460
Yes.

199
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,460
We just found out that my cousin didn't survive the accident.

200
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,510
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,680
- It's a bit much. - I'm so sorry.

202
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,470
I'm Dr. Melendez, and this is Dr. Murphy.

203
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,100
I'm Ricardo.

204
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,020
I'm M-Marco's father.

205
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,630
This is, uh, his mother, Lorena, and this is Sonia.

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,780
They were getting married tonight.

207
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,390
How's my son?

208
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,330
Marco's femur was completely shattered,

209
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,600
and his lower leg isn't getting enough blood.

210
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,460
Can you save his leg?

211
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,180
Marco suffered too much bone fragmentation.

212
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,640
We can't fix it.

213
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,550
Our only choice is to amputate.

214
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,090
Mija.

215
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,910
Bay Five needs a grade three hyphema.

216
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,400
Head CT and page ophthalmology?

217
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,490
You read my mind.

218
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,470
Been a while.

219
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,640
How you holding up pulling an all-nighter?

220
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,300
I'll manage, but if you can find me a caffeine IV,

221
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,870
- Please move! - it'd be helpful.

222
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,850
- Tough night. - Yeah.

223
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,830
Thanks for coming.

224
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,080
It's part of the job.

225
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,670
So, when's the big day?

226
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,850
We haven't set it yet.

227
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,690
Oh, where is it gonna be?

228
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,320
We'll figure it out.

229
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,430
Maybe a beach somewhere.

230
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,880
We should talk about this later.

231
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,520
What? I like beaches.

232
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,500
If you have a more romantic idea...

233
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,360
My family likes churches.

234
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,040
We should talk about this later.

235
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,740
Dr. Lim, I think one of your yellows is about to turn red.

236
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,740
I've got my wedding all planned out.

237
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,050
I've got the dress, and I've got the flowers.

238
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,780
All I need is a groom.

239
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,860
You available, Dr. Murphy?

240
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,270
No.

241
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,190
You don't want some love?

242
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,120
No. No, I don't. I don't want love.

243
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,770
Dr. Glassman, neural consult, bay three.

244
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,810
Thank you.

245
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,840
I was here first.

246
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,970
Shaun.

247
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,150
Shaun!

248
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,370
My patient's scans are very important.

249
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,820
Well, my patient's important, too.

250
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,080
I need to see my patient's scans.

251
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,590
Is your patient pre-op or post-op?

252
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,400
Pre-op.

253
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,640
Okay, I'll give you the computer,

254
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,050
but you need to apologize first.

255
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,970
Okay, I'm sorry. Turn it on.

256
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,830
Why was Marco's family crying when Dr. Melendez

257
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,100
told them his leg would need to be amputated?

258
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, their son's leg is about to be cut off.

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,550
It's sad. Crying is normal.

260
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,210
But when your options are amputation or death,

261
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,920
amputation is good news.

262
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,770
People need time to adjust to big changes.

263
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,130
Marco's family didn't even get a chance to pray for a miracle.

264
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,880
It's not possible.

265
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,720
The bone damage is too severe.

266
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,390
A rod implantation won't work.

267
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,570
There's nothing to anchor into,

268
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,040
and the shunt won't last long enough to do reconstruction.

269
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,740
There are no other options.

270
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,960
What if we could replace the entire femur?

271
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,190
We're making him a new femur.

272
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,860
With a 3D printer?

273
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,990
3D-printed bones have only successfully been done with the mandible.

274
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,960
We know.

275
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,040
- That's a fairly small bone. - We know.

276
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,160
A femur has to support the weight of the entire body.

277
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,640
This one will be titanium. It can work.

278
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,020
It's an interesting idea...

279
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,880
but I need to think on it.

280
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,900
Right now we still got seven yellow tags waiting.

281
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,120
What do you have to think about?

282
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,890
- It's a good idea. - It's a brilliant idea.

283
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,250
The kid has brilliant ideas. That doesn't mean --

284
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,580
No, it was my idea,

285
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,780
and I'm aware of the risks --

286
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,850
infection, clotting, hardware failure...

287
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,610
Death.

288
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,000
- It wasn't your idea. - It was my idea!

289
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,530
And the risks are significant,

290
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,840
but isn't that their call?

291
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,790
- Don't we have to... - Maybe he said something,

292
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,130
and then you said something, and together, you --

293
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,090
My idea. Completely my idea.

294
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,070
The "brilliant" idea is 100% my brilliant idea.

295
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,550
Why is that a problem for you?

296
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,850
Maybe because I've known you for six months.

297
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,690
Every day we learn new things.

298
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,490
Today, you learned I'm brilliant.

299
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,230
The idea was brilliant.

300
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,220
And it was mine.

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,860
And if anyone can do this brilliant surgery,

302
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,480
it's you.

303
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,140
Flattery --

304
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,400
also brilliant.

305
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,380
Sleeping on the job?

306
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,890
Just needed some fresh air.

307
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,090
Feels like I'm suffocating in there.

308
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,380
She's in pain, spilling her guts out,

309
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,700
and every time I open my mouth,

310
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,790
I sound like an idiot.

311
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,590
Dr. Kalu -- unable to talk to women.

312
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,730
There's a first.

313
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,790
If you're not gonna be helpful, Claire, just leave.

314
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,530
You don't need to talk. Just listen to her.

315
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,610
You get to come out here, clear your head.

316
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,690
She's trapped in there,

317
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,690
alone with her thoughts, her fears.

318
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,250
You don't think she wants to get out?

319
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,570
You are her escape.

320
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,640
You want to put a fake femur into Marco's leg?

321
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,580
It's not fake. It's real.

322
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,140
It's not a real bone. We're making it out of titanium.

323
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,070
It's still real.

324
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,260
That's incredible.

325
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,210
And Marco will be able to walk, run, climb?

326
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,370
And swim.

327
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,510
Hopefully. That's the intention.

328
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,050
Well, have you done the surgery before?

329
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,620
- I haven't. - We'll be the first.

330
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,750
Well, nobody has ever attempted this surgery

331
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,670
with a bone as large as the femur.

332
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,490
I believe it's a viable option, but there are risks.

333
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,980
Risks? Could Marco die?

334
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,890
In my estimation, there's a 10% chance he won't make it.

335
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:45,750
Then no.

336
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,360
I'm not losing my son.

337
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,220
Wait. If there's a chance we can save Marco's leg,

338
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,680
we should at least discuss this some more.

339
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,850
That's what he'd want.

340
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,230
He'd want to live.

341
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,800
He'd want to have a life.

342
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,490
I know him.

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,630
He'd want to take the chance.

344
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,950
I will never forgive myself if Marco died

345
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,850
because I made a reckless decision.

346
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,960
Whose decision is this?

347
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,540
Does he have a healthcare proxy?

348
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,170
I don't know what that is.

349
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,150
When the accident happened,

350
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,040
were you on the way to your wedding or on the way back?

351
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,690
We were headed to the wedding.

352
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,640
Marco's parents are the next of kin.

353
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,870
They decide.

354
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,200
Please...

355
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,100
amputate our son's leg.

356
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,710
Murphy.

357
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,660
Why is the primary closure on the stump so vital in amputation surgery?

358
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,360
For a proper prosthetic fitting.

359
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:49,860
Why are you marrying Jessica?

360
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,160
Why does anyone get married?

361
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,150
I don't know.

362
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,290
I love her.

363
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,670
I don't understand why having someone to love

364
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,370
is so important to everyone.

365
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:06,630
You have to stand down.

366
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,200
- You can't amputate Marco's leg. - Why not?

367
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,410
I filed an emergency injunction to stop the surgery.

368
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,800
You were in a car accident.

369
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,310
Your neck was punctured.

370
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,210
The repair surgery went well.

371
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,600
You're gonna have to stay put for a week

372
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,960
before we can release you.

373
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,970
You're very lucky to be alive.

374
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,610
My wife, Jenna Hensel -- is she okay?

375
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,910
Can I see her?

376
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,160
She's not listed.

377
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,270
That's a good thing.

378
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,050
She's probably still in the waiting room.

379
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,890
I'll find her and bring her up.

380
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,880
She'll be relieved to know you're okay.

381
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,960
Okay.

382
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,580
What the hell am I supposed to do with an unconscious patient

383
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,790
whose leg is a ticking time bomb?

384
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,040
Judge Singh is en route.

385
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,910
She wants to hear from both parties and the doctors on the case.

386
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,520
I have to testify?

387
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,650
- Hopefully not. - Hopefully not.

388
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,150
I thought you would be happy.

389
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,030
You thought you could save the leg,

390
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,100
and I didn't want that not happening because the parents

391
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,280
are afraid to make a tough call.

392
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,700
It's their call to make.

393
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,400
And if the accident happened an hour later,

394
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,910
it would be the wife's.

395
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,360
And she wants the fake leg.

396
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,650
It's not fake.

397
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,770
I thought you didn't believe in just blindly following protocol.

398
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,980
He's their son.

399
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,570
Nobody's gonna love him more than them.

400
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,570
Seriously?

401
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,780
All parents love all children more than anybody else?

402
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,560
People get divorced all the time.

403
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,130
How often do they give up their kids?

404
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,470
So, if this was us,

405
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,340
you'd want your parents to decide over me?

406
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,270
- I didn't say that. - You kind of did.

407
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,230
I was saying, there needs to be rules,

408
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,620
that there needs to be bright red lines telling us

409
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,250
who gets to make these calls.

410
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,040
It's the parents' call.

411
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,010
Not anymore.

412
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:54,760
Now it's the judge's.

413
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,640
How much time does Marco have left on the temporary shunt?

414
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,880
Three hours,

415
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,660
and then his leg will die.

416
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,350
Okay.

417
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,630
Dr. Torture returns.

418
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,510
Thought I'd scared you off for good.

419
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,990
Pick a movie.

420
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,200
You deserve to get out of this room for a little while, too.

421
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,810
You think "Groundhog Day" is gonna make a difference?

422
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,840
"I'm torturing you, but, hey, you get to watch a funny movie."

423
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,310
That is sort of what I was going for, yeah.

424
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,660
I'm sorry.

425
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,580
I wish there was something else I could do.

426
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,890
How do you know there isn't?

427
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,510
This is protocol. This is what they teach us.

428
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,670
I lucked out.

429
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,330
I got the world's greatest expert on burn victims?

430
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,780
You know everything that can be done.

431
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,190
He loves to rock-climb, scuba dive, bungee-jump.

432
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,650
This is insane.

433
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,300
His leg is literally dying while we sit here reminiscing.

434
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,420
Please. We're trying to figure out what your son would want.

435
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,180
- He would want to live. - I want that, too,

436
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,260
but if there's a way that we can save Marco's leg,

437
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,260
he'd want me to do it.

438
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,340
Mija, Do you know what he wanted most of all?

439
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,650
He wanted to marry you.

440
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,010
He wanted to spend his life with you, have children with you.

441
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,020
Now, he can do all that.

442
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,750
He can be happy with a prosthetic leg.

443
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,100
He's young, and he's strong.

444
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,740
Mija, he can get through this.

445
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,860
- When we met -- - I don't care about your stories.

446
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,760
I don't care that you met rock-climbing

447
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,780
or kayaking or whatever.

448
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,820
- I just want -- - We met in rehab.

449
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,640
Hey, are either of you Jenna Hensel?

450
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,930
I haven't seen Jenna since we took pictures at the hotel.

451
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,720
But she got on the bus?

452
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,870
Yeah, she was sitting with Noomi.

453
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,760
I think she's still out there.

454
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,920
- Hey, guys! We've got to go back. - Where?

455
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,230
To the crash site. Now.

456
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,690
He never wanted you to know.

457
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,700
He's an addict.

458
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,970
He replaced one addiction for another one -- a healthier one.

459
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,060
- But he needs -- - What?

460
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,350
He needs to wakeboard or he'll drink himself to death?

461
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,300
- This is ridiculous. - No, it's not!

462
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,150
We talked about it a lot.

463
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,340
It's pretty much all you do in rehab.

464
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,420
Marco has clarity for the first time in his life.

465
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,540
He knows what makes him happy.

466
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,260
He knows his weaknesses.

467
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,060
He's not as strong as you think.

468
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,850
And that's okay, but --

469
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,630
Marco cheated on you.

470
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,460
It was about a month ago.

471
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,740
He was overwhelmed with the wedding and the planning.

472
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,360
He ran into an ex-girlfriend.

473
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,120
It only happened once.

474
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,290
You're lying.

475
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,600
You're upset that he had secrets from you, so --

476
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,300
No, she's not lying.

477
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,590
Mija, he -- he was -- he was so upset.

478
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,590
He does love you.

479
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:42,180
Okay, maybe we're digressing here a little bit.

480
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,560
And we really don't have the time.

481
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,830
It matters.

482
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,600
She doesn't know him like --

483
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,090
maybe none of us do, but...

484
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,160
but we are his parents, and you're not his wife. Yet.

485
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,120
Okay. Get the cops. Check everywhere --

486
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,100
other side of the road, bushes, trees.

487
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:18,990
If she was ejected from the bus,

488
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,950
she could be 40, 50 feet in any direction.

489
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,040
Jenna!

490
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,740
I found her! I need some help!

491
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,440
Okay, she's got a brain bleed.

492
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,360
We need to get her out of here now!

493
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,200
Dr. Andrews.

494
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,980
I think Celez may be eligible

495
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,700
for an experimental bone treatment.

496
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,010
Sell it to me.

497
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,340
Well, I've been doing some digging.

498
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,600
San Diego Community Hospital's burn unit

499
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,700
has been following a Brazilian hospital's protocol

500
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,350
to wrap burns in tilapia skins.

501
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,120
Now -- Now, I know fish skins sound a bit crazy,

502
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,220
but -- but I was thinking we could do the same thing here.

503
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,100
Dr. Kalu, I applaud your thinking.

504
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,840
- But we -- - Tilapia skins contain more collagen proteins --

505
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,150
both types 1 and 3 -- than even human skin,

506
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,430
which aids in tissue repair,

507
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,940
- negating the need for grafts. - Dr. Kalu.

508
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,330
- It's shown to accelerate healing, would reduce... - Dr. Kalu.

509
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,890
the risk of infection and cut down on the patient's physical pain.

510
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,800
Are you finished, or would you like to cut me off again?

511
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,520
Okay, let's follow this through, shall we?

512
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,470
You have to come up with a proposal for the experimental treatment,

513
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,730
get it approved by our institutional review board,

514
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,280
get your hands on medical-grade tilapia skins, and then we...

515
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,370
Well, I thought you could help expedite the process.

516
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,670
You think I could bring it down from three months to two hours?

517
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,630
You finish the debridement?

518
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,470
- Okay, I'll take over from here. - Okay.

519
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,990
Keep thinking outside the box.

520
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,480
Initiative is good.

521
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,300
I'm in. Bag her.

522
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,390
Did you get me the drill?

523
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,860
The fire truck had one. What's going on?

524
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,860
Her pupil's blown.

525
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,140
She has a subdural hematoma,

526
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,050
causing increased intracranial pressure.

527
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,220
If I don't alleviate it now,

528
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,380
there's no way she makes it to the hospital alive.

529
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,950
Okay.

530
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,180
Unconscious female. Flail chest.

531
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,940
I had to do a burr hole in field.

532
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,010
Her sats are in the low 70s.

533
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,490
She's good to go to the O.R.

534
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,710
Subdural hematoma?

535
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,040
She had decerebrate posturing, a blown left pupil.

536
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,570
When I passed the drill bit through her skull,

537
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,030
a whole lot of blood pooled out.

538
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,930
Good call.

539
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,650
San Diego Community Hospital called.

540
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:13,150
They're sending the tilapia skins.

541
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,410
They're medevacing them in.

542
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,490
Should be here within the hour.

543
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,970
Celez...

544
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,650
you meet the criteria for an experimental treatment

545
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,560
that I think will prevent you from having to undergo skin grafts.

546
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,780
Hold up. How did this even happen?

547
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,720
Well, I found out San Diego's trial

548
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,770
allows for multi-site collaborations.

549
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,810
So, there's no need for us to get our own I.R.B.

550
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,110
They give us the skins, we provide the patient data.

551
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,410
Fish skins?

552
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,880
The tilapia skins have been cleaned and sterilized.

553
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,150
They're perfectly safe.

554
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,000
You'll do it?

555
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,120
I'll do it.

556
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,800
Well done, Dr. Kalu.

557
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,170
Well done.

558
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,510
So help you God?

559
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,340
Yes.

560
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,580
- Dr. Melendez can tell you -- - He has.

561
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,360
But the fake femur is yours, though, right?

562
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,960
- How confident are you in its design? - It's not fake!

563
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,420
- Shaun, she needs to know -- - I know what she needs to know.

564
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,630
She needs to know will it work.

565
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,260
She needs to know how long it will last.

566
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,310
Yes.

567
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,210
Okay.

568
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,160
He's his doctor?

569
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,170
He is a surgical resident. He's very gifted.

570
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,460
Is he going to answer my questions?

571
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,950
Shaun, I really need you to focus.

572
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,090
- Marco is running out of time! - Just let him answer!

573
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,200
No, we already know the answer. They don't know.

574
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,710
This thing has never been done before.

575
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:46,770
Be quiet!

576
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,590
His toes are changing color.

580
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,740
He's clotting. That's bad. Page Dr. Melendez stat!

581
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,590
- Murphy, what do we got? - The shunt is clotting.

582
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,670
It's restricting blood flow. It is failing.

583
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,030
All right, we need a decision now.

584
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,700
Are we cutting off the leg or replacing the bone?

585
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,510
There's no doubt in my mind that Marco's parents

586
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,380
and fiancée all love Marco, but it's become clear --

587
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,140
Now. I need a decision now.

588
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,250
His parents know him as their child.

589
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,880
Sonia knows him as a man.

590
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,970
Replace the femur.

591
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,170
Let's go!

592
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,090
Thank you! Thank you.

593
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,340
- And there's the bleed. See it? - Yes, sir.

594
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,020
You ever clip an intracranial artery before?

595
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,780
No, sir.

596
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:55,380
Go for it.

597
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,900
Just like every first time --

598
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,700
you're a little excited, a little nauseous.

599
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,330
Hopefully nobody gets hurt.

600
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,240
Is it good to go?

601
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,680
It's very good.

602
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,650
Forceps.

603
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,940
You ready?

604
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,880
Yes.

605
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:19,360
Be careful the clip blades don't catch any perforated arteries.

606
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,360
I don't seen any vessels in the way.

607
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,680
Then what are you waiting for?

608
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,430
Very nice.

609
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,370
Thank you.

610
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,060
Everything's dry.

611
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,640
Say goodbye and close the roof.

612
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,100
We need to get blood back into his leg

613
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,620
in the next minute or so,

614
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,020
or I'm gonna have to amputate after all.

615
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,840
Insulin's hanging, loaded him with calcium.

616
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,950
Best I can do.

617
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,360
Let's release the clamps.

618
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,420
Check for capillary refill.

619
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,110
Blood flow is restored.

620
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,420
EKG is normal.

621
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,510
Okay. Kim, I want to hear words like "Variability" and "Delta".

622
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,580
Give them to me.

623
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,610
I'm waiting patiently.

624
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,430
I'm not getting anything.

625
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,540
Show me.

626
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,870
Check the leads.

627
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,200
Still nothing.

628
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,130
Maybe there will be some neuroplasticity.

629
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,480
Her brain -- I-it could rewire itself.

630
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:56,840
No.

631
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,270
Zero brain activity.

632
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,030
I don't know why, but she's gone.

633
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,840
What?

634
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,060
Your neurosurgery patient that died tonight --

635
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,630
there's something you should know.

636
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:26,890
What?

637
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,100
Now, Marco, I want you to try and move your toes.

638
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,790
I can't.

639
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,020
Is he okay?

640
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,990
We're not sure if the bone --

641
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,890
He's not gonna die?

642
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:54,600
H-He's not gonna get an infection?

643
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,400
- His body's not gonna reject -- - No, no.

644
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,280
We're monitoring him very closely.

645
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,080
- The biggest threat is behind -- - He moved.

646
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,060
He moved.

647
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,370
It worked.

648
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,290
You'll have a long recovery ahead --

649
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,040
months of physical therapy.

650
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,760
But for now, all you have to do is rest.

651
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,770
Thank you.

652
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:21,140
Thank you for saving my life -- for saving my leg.

653
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,070
- Thank you. - You're welcome, sir.

654
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,200
Are you ready to finish what we started?

655
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,700
Get well first.

656
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,850
There's plenty of time for a wedding.

657
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,930
- Thank you. - You're welcome, sir.

658
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,180
Thank you.

659
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,180
You look good.

660
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,530
Tough. Like Aquaman.

661
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,600
I look like sushi.

662
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,470
Everybody loves sushi.

663
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,520
It's only for six months.

664
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,730
Your new skin should have completely grown in by then.

665
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,190
Should have minor scarring.

666
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,860
Thank you.

667
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,590
I misjudged you.

668
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,210
You judged me just right.

669
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,000
Is she still sleeping?

670
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,140
- You haven't told her yet? - No.

671
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,470
Can I have a moment please?

672
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,280
Of course.

673
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,730
How soon after you found Jenna at the crash site

674
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,400
did you intubate her?

675
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,760
Almost immediately.

676
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,940
I did a sternal rub.

677
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,680
She had decerebrate posturing.

678
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,370
Her left pupil was blown.

679
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,000
I knew she had a subdural hematoma,

680
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,660
so I intubated, did the burr hole.

681
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,440
She also had a flail chest.

682
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,290
Did you check her breathing after you intubated her?

683
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,030
Yes.

684
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:22,370
Well, at least I-I think I did.

685
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,570
Dr. Lim told me that when Jenna came into the E.R.,

686
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,510
she wasn't ventilating properly.

687
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,450
You inserted the tube too deep

688
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,220
into her right main stem bronchus

689
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,390
of her injured lung.

690
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,260
We had no way of knowing

691
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,650
how long she was hypoxic before we gave her the EEG.

692
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,190
I drilled a perfect burr hole into her skull

693
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,570
on the side of the road in the middle of the night,

694
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:02,390
and I-I-I screw up her intubation?

695
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,630
Yes.

696
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,900
It was tough conditions for anyone --

697
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,110
resident or not.

698
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,600
Any one of us could have made the same mistake.

699
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,520
I had a woman come into the E.R. once...

700
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,270
a mother, 51 years old.

701
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,150
Francine Parker.

702
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,180
She had two boys.

703
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,640
She had a cough --

704
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,200
a bad one -- but a cough.

705
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,270
I checked her out,

706
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,140
gave her some antibiotics, sent her home.

707
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,300
Six hours later, she was rolled into the E.R..

708
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,850
She had had a heart attack, and I missed it, and...

709
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,350
she died.

710
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,050
Not one day...

711
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,810
goes by when I don't think about her.

712
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,670
She was your first.

713
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,800
My fourth, actually.

714
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,500
You're not gonna forget this.

715
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,790
You never forget.

716
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,240
But I don't know, maybe we're better off for it

717
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,600
the next time around.

718
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,300
You got to find a way to keep going.

719
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,360
Go home. Get some rest.

720
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,090
I haven't even told her yet.

721
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,460
You're not going to.

722
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,560
You made a mistake. You're too close to this.

723
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,800
I'm not gonna allow you to talk to the family

724
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,980
or anyone else outside this hospital about this.

725
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,050
Do we understand each other?

726
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,330
Yes, sir.

727

for including us in their study.

734
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,920
They said they were happy to do it.

735
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,230
And they asked that I pass along their thanks to you

736

737

I don't begrudge that, but you...

can't open your wallet every time a patient's in need.

My healthcare proxy.

Jess, nothing's gonna happen.

748

Really? That's good to know.

Been a doctor for a long while --

Why did Nurse Farrar ask if I wanted love?

760
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,200
'Cause she's a nosy...

761
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,800
Shaun, you really don't want love?

762
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,910
I loved Steve and my rabbit.

763
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,930
Not anymore.

764
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,070
You don't love them anymore?

765
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,430
No, I don't. They're dead.

766
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,060
You can't love someone if they're dead.

767
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,710
Well, I've lost people I love.

768
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,150
I miss them, and it hurts, but I still love them.

769
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,740
I don't want love.

770
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,620
Okay.

771
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:04,830
You want breakfast?

772
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,210
Can I have four pancakes instead of three?

773
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,310
You can have five.

774
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,360
I only want four.

775
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,550
Okay.

776
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,610
Okay.
