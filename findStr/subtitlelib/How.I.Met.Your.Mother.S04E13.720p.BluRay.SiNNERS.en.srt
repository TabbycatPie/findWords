1
00:00:02,957 --> 00:00:04,822
<i>Kids, in our sophomore year
of college,</i>

2
00:00:04,926 --> 00:00:06,723
<i>when Aunt Lily came back
from spring break,</i>

3
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:09,296
<i>Uncle Marshall surprised her at the airport.</i>

4
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:12,390
<i>And she surprised him
with a six-pack of locally brewed beer.</i>

5
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:15,095
Fort Lager-Dale! Get it?

6
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:17,229
<i>And with that, a ritual was born.</i>

7
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:20,941
<i>For the next 11 years, whenever
either of them would fly anywhere...</i>

8
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:23,671
Minne-Cider! Get it?

9
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:26,442
<i>...the reunion was always commemorated
with a chauffeur sign</i>

10
00:00:26,549 --> 00:00:28,414
<i>and a six-pack from wherever they'd been.</i>

11
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,386
Aspen Yards Ale! Get it?

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,753
- Actually, no.
- Me, neither. I was hoping you would.

13
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:39,788
<i>But then, one night in January of 2009,
the unthinkable happened.</i>

14
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,331
- I'm not picking her up.
- What?

15
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,628
Lily doesn't want me taking a cab
all the way to the airport

16
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:47,226
just to take a cab
all the way back, you know?

17
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,498
But the six-pack thing.

18
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:51,769
Ted, that stuff was fun
when we were younger,

19
00:00:51,876 --> 00:00:56,610
but we've grown past that. As we mature,
the relationship matures with us.

20
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,309
But, I mean, you guys are such
an inspiration to the rest of us,

21
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:01,851
how you're so devoted and connected.

22
00:01:01,953 --> 00:01:05,548
I look at you guys,
and that's all I want in the whole world.

23
00:01:05,657 --> 00:01:08,148
Ted, there's two college girls outside,
and they look easy!

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,256
So, Arizona...

25
00:01:12,365 --> 00:01:15,801
You know, I've always wanted to see
what an Arizona driver's license looks like.

26
00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:17,699
I already ran that play, bro.
They're 21. We're good.

27
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:20,328
Thank God.
So, what brings you guys to town?

28
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,838
Our band's got a gig.

29
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:24,672
You're in a band?
Hey, maybe we can come see you play.

30
00:01:24,778 --> 00:01:26,575
Excuse us for a sec.

31
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:29,507
Ted, what the hell is the matter with you?

32
00:01:29,616 --> 00:01:32,176
- We're not gonna go see them play.
- Why not?

33
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:35,653
If we see them play, we're no better
than the bleach-blonde bimbos

34
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:38,317
who flash their boobs
at a Van Halen concert.

35
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:41,520
Yeah, but don't those girls get to have sex
with Van Halen after the show?

36
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:44,689
If you want to have sex with Van Halen,
do it on your own time, Ted.

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,427
We are not the
"maybe we can come see you play" guys.

38
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:48,524
We're the other guys,

39
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:53,301
the older guys who never showed up
and whose approval they now crave.

40
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:57,042
- So, we're their dads?
- Exactly.

41
00:01:57,146 --> 00:01:58,306
Okay.

42
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:02,146
It's a big meeting,
so I don't think we're gonna make it.

43
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,151
Maybe next time, kiddos.

44
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:05,720
But if you guys want
to meet up after your show,

45
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,916
- maybe we could exchange numbers...
- Excuse us for a minute.

46
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:14,329
Ted, have you gone completely insane?
We don't want their phone numbers.

47
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,867
Yeah. I don't know what I was doing.
I guess I panicked out there.

48
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:20,061
When you exchange numbers with a chick,

49
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,731
you give them the ability
to call and cancel.

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,071
If you set a date without a number,
they have to show up.

51
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,543
Check and mate!

52
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,546
The only digits I need are these.

53
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:34,545
Honka.

54
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,547
Are you still their dad?

55
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,021
So, why don't we just meet here
tomorrow night around 10:00?

56
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:45,858
I think it's supposed to snow.
What do we do if there's a blizzard?

57
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:49,365
- Either way, we'll be here.
- Snow problem.

58
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:52,968
Excuse us just one last second.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,831
What is the problem now?

60
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,565
Nice one.

61
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,201
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

62
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:00,746
All right, we'll see you tomorrow night.

63
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,576
- Totally.
- Awesome!

64
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,976
"Totally. " "Awesome!"
Man, these college chicks sound stupid.

65
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,145
- Totally.
- Awesome.

66
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:13,420
So, here's the thing, tomorrow night,
dress to move, it's gonna be a mess!

67
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,927
I still think
we should've gotten their numbers.

68
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,464
You always assume something
is gonna go wrong.

69
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:22,002
Ted, I promise you,
nothing is gonna go wrong.

70
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:24,537
Hey, it's starting to snow.

71
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,728
<i>Kids, the blizzard of '09
was a monster.</i>

72
00:03:52,836 --> 00:03:57,705
<i>It snowed for three days straight,
which led to three amazing stories.</i>

73
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:59,105
<i>I'll start with me and Barney.</i>

74
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:01,871
It's pretty nasty out there.
I don't think they're coming.

75
00:04:01,978 --> 00:04:04,004
Of course they're coming. They have to.

76
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:08,313
If I can land just one of these girls,
I'll have party school bingo.

77
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:16,888
- Come on, Ted. You're the only one here.
- Oh, sorry. What's party school bingo?

78
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:22,127
<i>Every year, Playboy releases a list
of the top party schools in the country.</i>

79
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:26,102
I take the top 25,
and I make up a bingo card.

80
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:30,701
All I need is Arizona Tech, which is crazy.

81
00:04:30,809 --> 00:04:34,007
In league play, that would normally
be designated a free space.

82
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:37,811
So, how many people are in
on this party school bingo thing?

83
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:40,943
- Oh, it's just me.
- So what's the point, then?

84
00:04:41,054 --> 00:04:43,955
The point is to get five in a row.

85
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:47,993
And what do you get
when you get five in a row?

86
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,795
I get bingo.

87
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:55,098
Thanks for coming by.

88
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:57,295
I monkeyed around with the thermostat
for about an hour

89
00:04:57,404 --> 00:05:01,774
- before I realized it was the intercom.
- Yeah, I heard you swearing downstairs.

90
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:06,371
Hey, so, Lily's flight's coming in tonight.
You're really not gonna go pick her up?

91
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:13,250
Robin, Robin, like I said, as we mature,
our relationship matures with us.

92
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:17,918
Yeah, well, if I know your wife,
she's gonna get you that six-pack anyway.

93
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:23,261
Marshall? Marshall?

94
00:05:24,066 --> 00:05:28,935
Puget Stout.
A most exquisite Seattle microbrew.

95
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,234
And speaking of six-packs...

96
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:40,049
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the airport.

97
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,119
How could I be so stupid?
Of course she's bringing me a six-pack!

98
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:46,314
But this time, I didn't bring him a six-pack.

99
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:50,622
Because as we mature,
the relationship matures with us.

100
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:54,089
Well, he sounds like a nice young man.

101
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:58,163
I'll bet he surprises you
and picks you up anyway.

102
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:03,264
- Oh, baby.
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

103
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:07,705
- Where's my beer?
- We said we weren't gonna.

104
00:06:10,249 --> 00:06:11,409
I have beer.

105
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:14,681
Wow. A six-pack
and you're an appropriate height for me.

106
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,585
Let's go, New Lily.

107
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:20,649
Oh, man, I got to get some beer.

108
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,318
<i>Folks, this is your captain speaking.</i>

109
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:25,330
<i>Looks like we're going to be arriving
an hour early.</i>

110
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:26,558
Yes!

111
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:29,969
Drink up, boys. I'm closing the bar.

112
00:06:30,071 --> 00:06:33,700
- Whoa, no! It's only 9:00.
- And this place is raging, yo!

113
00:06:35,543 --> 00:06:38,740
Guys, I'm really sorry, but I got to go
set up cots in the church basement.

114
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,814
It doubles as a shelter
on snowy nights like this.

115
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,315
You selfish bastard!

116
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:44,942
There are two very hot girls
coming here to meet us.

117
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:46,918
Can't you just leave the place open
a little while longer?

118
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,513
- We'll keep an eye on everything.
- You two? No way.

119
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,525
You wouldn't know the first thing
about running a bar.

120
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:55,222
- Serve the hotties first?
- Here's the keys.

121
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,800
Here's the keys.

122
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:05,271
As soon as your girls show up,
you turn off the lights and you lock up.

123
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,809
And I don't want to come back here
and find this place trashed.

124
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,105
- Wow, seriously?
- I can trust you guys.

125
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:12,842
<i>To understand what it meant
to us to get the keys to MacLaren's,</i>

126
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,681
<i>I have to take you back a few years,
to the night that I uttered five little words</i>

127
00:07:16,787 --> 00:07:19,415
<i>that every man, at some point in his life,
will say.</i>

128
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:23,050
- We should buy a bar.
- Of course, we should buy a bar!

129
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,358
- We should totally buy a bar.
- We should totally buy a bar.

130
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:32,130
- Our bar would be awesome.
- And dude, dude, dude, dude,

131
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:36,770
the name of our bar, Puzzles.

132
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:40,309
People will be like,
"Why is it called Puzzles?"

133
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,244
That's the puzzle.

134
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:45,817
That is

135
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,386
a great name for a bar!

136
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:52,821
- And also, at Puzzles, no last call.
- No last call!

137
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:57,158
Only when every single person is finished
having the greatest night of his or her life

138
00:07:57,264 --> 00:07:58,697
do we stack the chairs on the table

139
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:02,235
and power down
the three-story margarita waterfall.

140
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:05,134
- We should buy a bar.
- We should buy a bar.

141
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:07,468
<i>And like the other ill-advised
five-word sentences</i>

142
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,509
<i>every man eventually says in his life...</i>

143
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:11,942
I can jump that far.

144
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:14,071
I'm gonna win her back.

145
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:15,942
I can trust you guys.

146
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,144
<i>...we would come to regret it.
We just didn't know it yet.</i>

147
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:23,257
<i>Aruba, Jamaica
ooh I wanna take ya</i>

148
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:27,261
<i>Bermuda, Bahama
come on pretty mama</i>

149
00:08:27,363 --> 00:08:30,628
<i>Key Largo, Montego
baby why don't we go</i>

150
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,759
<i>Ooh I wanna take you
down to Kokomo</i>

151
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:37,863
<i>We'll get there fast
and then we'll take it slow</i>

152
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:43,139
<i>That's where we wanna go
way down in Kokomo</i>

153
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:48,283
You have it? Awesome, I'll be right there.

154
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,087
- Ranjit!
- Hello.

155
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:55,317
- I'm Rachel Sondheimer.
- Wait a minute, Lily.

156
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:59,021
If you are getting off the plane,
where is Marshall?

157
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,495
And where is your six-pack?

158
00:09:00,598 --> 00:09:05,501
That's the problem. I have to get to
Brewniverse in East Meadow in an hour.

159
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:08,095
- To the Town Car!
- Thank you.

160
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,036
- Barkeep, Triple Sec.
- Coming right up, tap-minder.

161
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:15,201
- Hey!
- Hey!

162
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:18,273
We'll get one.

163
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:22,350
- Order up!
- Order up. Okay.

164
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:28,690
- We'll get one.
- Oh, thank God you're still here.

165
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,729
<i>I don't know if you guys
have ever seen Star Wars,</i>

166
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,458
- but it's like Hoth out there.
- Dibs.

167
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:37,970
It reminds me of when I used
to go sledding with my dad, before he left.

168
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:41,666
- And dibs.
- So, can we warm you up with a drink?

169
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:45,506
Sure. Oh, by the way, I invited the rest
of the band to come and meet us.

170
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:48,410
We were hoping to get drunk.
I mean, really drunk.

171
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:52,509
- Like my dad used to.
- Dibsity, dibsity, dibsity.

172
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:55,453
Well, I guess we could keep the place open
a little bit longer.

173
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:57,525
As long as it's just you and the band.

174
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:03,163
Melissa, what kind of band is this?

175
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:06,063
We're the Arizona Tech
Fighting Hens Marching Band.

176
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:08,068
- Go, Hens!
- Go, Hens!

177
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,694
<i>And then,
your Uncle Barney and I</i>

178
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:12,296
<i>had one of our telepathic conversations.</i>

179
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:17,038
<i>Dude, Carl's gonna kill us if we don't
kick everyone out of here right now.</i>

180
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:21,241
<i>Aruba, Jamaica
ooh I wanna take ya</i>

181
00:10:21,418 --> 00:10:24,910
<i>Barney, I'm serious. We promised
we wouldn't mess the place up.</i>

182
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:29,014
<i>Bermuda, Bahama
come on pretty mama</i>

183
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:30,888
<i>All right, I guess you have a point.</i>

184
00:10:32,362 --> 00:10:34,354
The bar is open!

185
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,859
Who wants a beer, huh?

186
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:42,770
I still say this is stupid.

187
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:46,401
What happened to, "As we mature,
the relationship matures with us"?

188
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:50,004
<i>That's just something
Lily read in Psychology Today.</i>

189
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:55,049
<i>All right, she read it in Cosmo.
All right, I read it in Cosmo.</i>

190
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:58,020
<i>All right, it was Cosmo Girl!
Just drive, okay?</i>

191
00:10:58,123 --> 00:11:01,854
I just don't get why it's such a big deal
that one little ritual goes by the wayside.

192
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,624
It's not just this, okay?
It's all of our little rituals.

193
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,358
Do you know what we used to do
every day, the second I got home?

194
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,961
Man, I don't want to hear
about your crazy monkey sex.

195
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,169
We would tell each other
what we had to eat that day.

196
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:21,572
Two eggs, a slice of cheese pizza
and some steamed veggies.

197
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,582
Everything bagel, chicken breast,

198
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,812
some celery sticks
and a spoon of peanut butter.

199
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,248
- Crazy monkey sex?
- Crazy monkey sex.

200
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:37,856
Lily, TMI, too many informations.

201
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:41,527
And you know what else I miss?
Our lunchtime phone call.

202
00:11:42,137 --> 00:11:44,799
Hey, baby, it's lunchtime, and I love you.

203
00:11:45,607 --> 00:11:47,735
I reciprocate in principle,

204
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:52,576
although with the caveat that there seems
to be a bit of a surplus here on my end.

205
00:11:52,682 --> 00:11:55,207
No, I love you more.

206
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:59,953
Do we need to get in a room together
and bang this thing out?

207
00:12:02,693 --> 00:12:07,790
Those sound like agreeable terms,
although I may need to adjust my briefs.

208
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:11,825
Love you, too.

209
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:17,405
But today when she called,
I let it go to voicemail. Voicemail!

210
00:12:17,508 --> 00:12:18,873
How could you?

211
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:22,174
The thing I miss most is kissing
at midnight on New Year's Eve.

212
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:26,408
It was a New Year's tradition.
But you know what we did this year?

213
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:29,252
- Crazy monkey sex?
- No.

214
00:12:32,992 --> 00:12:35,483
Okay, all these cute, adorable little rituals?

215
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:37,061
- Yeah.
- They're stupid.

216
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:41,292
Telling each other what you had to eat?
You're like children playing house.

217
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,427
Well, maybe you just think they're stupid

218
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:46,300
because you've never been
in a relationship

219
00:12:46,406 --> 00:12:48,067
long enough to develop them.

220
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:50,642
- What?
- Yeah, you don't understand love, okay?

221
00:12:50,744 --> 00:12:54,475
You're like some robot
who sees a person crying and says,

222
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:57,175
"Why is that human leaking?"

223
00:12:57,283 --> 00:12:58,945
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

224
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:00,850
Well, then, robot initiating

225
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:05,619
pull-over-to-the-side-of-the-road-
until-jackass-apologizes-to-me sequence.

226
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,197
My robot was, like, a million times better.

227
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:22,304
Hey, just so you know,
the trough in the bathroom is overflowing.

228
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:26,871
There's no trough in the bathroom.
And you just came out of the kitchen.

229
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:31,418
Ted, what's in a gin and tonic?
What's in a gin and tonic?

230
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:34,183
Okay, running a bar sucks.
Let's just close up.

231
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,087
No! No! There's no last call.

232
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,554
Puzzles, go for Barney.

233
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:40,660
Good. You're still there. I'll be there in five.

234
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:43,759
Last call!

235
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:52,133
Robin, there's a snowplow coming.
We have to get back on the road.

236
00:13:52,242 --> 00:13:55,302
You think the only way to be in love
is to have pet names.

237
00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:57,438
Or leave each other stupid, little notes,

238
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:01,144
or go charging off into a blizzard
for no good reason.

239
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:03,152
Do you understand what's
gonna happen if that plow comes by?

240
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:04,243
You know what you are?

241
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:05,515
- You're a love snob.
- Okay.

242
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:07,784
There's lots of ways
to be in a relationship,

243
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:10,828
and you would know that if you ever
left your little love snob country club.

244
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,592
We're going to get buried by snow.
That's going to happen.

245
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:17,362
No, screw this.
I'm not going to sit here and be insulted.

246
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,995
We're not going to the airport.
We're going home.

247
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,172
What just happened?

248
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:34,053
Hey, hey, hi. We called earlier
about the Seattle microbrew.

249
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:37,715
Yeah, good thing you called when you did.
I was getting ready to close up.

250
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:40,020
Storm of the century out there.

251
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:44,997
Of course, it's only '09, so storm of the
century might be a little bit premature.

252
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:48,967
Let's say storm of the year.
Although, it is only January.

253
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,528
We're kind of in a hurry,
so we'll take the beer now.

254
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:54,606
You are a cute couple.

255
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,473
- Thank you.
- We're not a couple.

256
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:58,944
Thank God. That would be weird.

257
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:04,675
Well, here she is. Supersonic Tonic.

258
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,289
No. This is a keg. I need a six-pack.

259
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,416
- A keg's all I got.
- We'll take the keg.

260
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:14,019
What? Oh, no.
Last time I had one of these in the car,

261
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,396
I wound up chipping dried vomit
off the seat with a putty knife.

262
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,995
I'm sorry, Ranjit, but this is a ritual,
and I am bringing him this beer.

263
00:15:24,975 --> 00:15:27,569
If you could just put it in the car.

264
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:30,947
- I'll give you 50 bucks.
- To the Town Car.

265
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:39,948
Look, Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot.

266
00:15:41,226 --> 00:15:44,127
I mean, if you are,
you're an incredibly advanced model,

267
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:47,062
and the human race
doesn't stand a chance.

268
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:52,300
You just don't choose to show your love
through corny rituals, and that's fine.

269
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:55,203
But maybe the reason Lily and I do
is because we always have,

270
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:58,004
and we don't know any other way.

271
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,070
One thing I do know is that
if she's there sitting at the airport alone,

272
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:06,481
I have to go get her. Those are the rules.

273
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:11,149
Marshall, close your eyes.

274
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:14,694
I don't know how you heard any of that
as me hitting on you, but...

275
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:16,194
Just do it.

276
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:26,566
Now, let's go get your woman.

277
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,376
All right, come on.

278
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:32,412
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

279
00:16:32,513 --> 00:16:35,175
I've always wanted to say that.
I mean, in a bar.

280
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:37,548
I say it all the time at home.

281
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:40,654
Dude, someday we should buy a bar.

282
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:44,283
And when we do,
we are never going to have last call.

283
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:49,691
Come on, Barney. We said no last call.
We got to mean it.

284
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:53,428
Well, what are we supposed to do?
Carl's going to be here any minute.

285
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:54,969
Only one thing we can do.

286
00:16:58,108 --> 00:17:03,273
Dude, running a bar is a pain in the ass.
We should just stick with what we know.

287
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:07,484
- We should start a band.
- Of course we should start a band.

288
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:09,485
How have we not started a band yet?

289
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:16,284
<i>Kids, sometimes in life,
the planets align, everything links up,</i>

290
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:18,487
<i>and your timing is perfect.</i>

291
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:20,724
- Marshall?
- Lily?

292
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:23,565
Marshall?

293
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,130
Lily?

294
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,187
<i>This wasn't one of those times.</i>

295
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,721
- Where is she?
- Seattle.

296
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:50,922
- What?
- Her flight's canceled. It never took off.

297
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:53,727
No, no, she would've called me and...

298
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:01,832
Hey, baby, it's me. My flight's been
canceled because of some snowstorm

299
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:07,074
and they couldn't rebook me till Thursday,
so I'm stuck here for another two days.

300
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:09,946
<i>But it's lunchtime, and I love you.</i>

301
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:14,146
<i>Like I said,
this was a three-day storm.</i>

302
00:18:14,255 --> 00:18:15,449
<i>Tuesday...</i>

303
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:16,819
I still say this is stupid.

304
00:18:16,925 --> 00:18:18,553
<i>Wednesday</i>

305
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:21,024
<i>and Thursday.</i>

306
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,119
...microbrew.

307
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:24,631
<i>So, on Tuesday,
when Marshall heard that message...</i>

308
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:26,998
She's not coming in till Thursday.

309
00:18:27,103 --> 00:18:30,163
I mean, we came all the way down here,
and she's not coming in till Thursday.

310
00:18:30,272 --> 00:18:31,934
I feel so stupid.

311
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:36,309
Look, let's just...
Let's not tell Lily about any of this, okay?

312
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,574
Especially the part
about you hitting on me.

313
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:41,150
- I didn't hit on you.
- Exactly.

314
00:18:42,986 --> 00:18:44,453
<i>Then on Wednesday...</i>

315
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:47,046
Oh, man, I can't believe
you drove all the way out there.

316
00:18:47,158 --> 00:18:48,125
Now you're just going to turn around

317
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:49,989
and drive all the way out there
again tomorrow.

318
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:52,961
Yeah, no.
This whole thing was a sign, you know?

319
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:56,659
It's time to put that old ritual to bed.
I'm not going to pick her up.

320
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:01,433
- And Robin really hit on you?
- Dude, it was weird.

321
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:07,474
Bros, this party is awesome!
You are true friends of the Fighting Hens.

322
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:11,242
If you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

323
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,978
Is the flute section seeing anyone?

324
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,457
So, wait, you're really
not gonna pick her up?

325
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:19,525
Yeah, really.

326
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,959
So, the New Year's kiss,
the lunchtime phone calls,

327
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:28,296
the whole "this is what I ate today" thing,
you're really letting it all go?

328
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,230
I really am.

329
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,306
<i>Which brings us to Thursday.</i>

330
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:17,947
A muffin, a pastrami sandwich
and a bag of chips.

331
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:21,183
And I know it's way past lunchtime,
but I love you.

332
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:26,558
More and more each day, I love you, Lily.
Happy New Year.

333
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:34,163
Wait, does this mean that I have to bring

334
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:35,534
a marching band
to the airport from now on?

335
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,006
- Absolutely, it does.
- Oh, crap.

336
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:51,249
<i>Go, Hens!
Go, Hens!</i>

337
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,825
- Puzzles.
- That is a great band name.

338
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:02,926
Hey, have you seen Amanda?

339
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:05,134
Bingo!
