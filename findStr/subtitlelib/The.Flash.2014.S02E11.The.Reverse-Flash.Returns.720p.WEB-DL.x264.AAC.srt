1
00:00:00,888 --> 00:00:02,321
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,323 --> 00:00:05,091
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:08,900
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:08,902 --> 00:00:11,903
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:15,020
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:17,409
I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:21,279
but in doing so, I opened up
our world to new threats,

8
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,149
and I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:26,465
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,462
Previously on "The Flash"...

11
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:29,897
I stabbed your mother in the heart

12
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,432
and I was free.

13
00:00:31,434 --> 00:00:32,867
Eddie is his ancestor.

14
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:34,401
If Eddie dies, he'll never be born.

15
00:00:34,403 --> 00:00:36,370
He's being erased from existence.

16
00:00:36,372 --> 00:00:38,072
- Gideon?
- Yes, Professor Thawne?

17
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:39,807
- Where the hell am I?
- I was accepted

18
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,932
into the forensic science program
at Midway City University.

19
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:44,089
I'm leaving Central City.

20
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,558
Joe, you have a son.

21
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,493
Hi, I'm Wally. I'm Francine's son.

22
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,094
These races? That's the only way

23
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:50,729
that I can pay for my
mom's hospital bills.

24
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,598
Jesse's my daughter. Zoom has her.

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,833
Daddy? Please help me.

26
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:55,301
Don't let him take me back there.

27
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:57,770
I would do anything to get you back.

28
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:02,942
There are many reasons why we run,

29
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:06,612
but usually it's to avoid
what's right in front of us...

30
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:07,913
A decision to be made

31
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:10,015
or a dilemma we have to face.

32
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:14,854
Lately, for me, it feels like
running is all I've been doing.

33
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:16,422
What you got for me, Cisco?

34
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:18,457
You've been playing Good
Samaritan all morning.

35
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:19,825
Take a break.

36
00:01:19,827 --> 00:01:21,861
Are you sure you don't
want to get to CCPD,

37
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:24,215
- give Patty your attention?
- No, I can see her later.

38
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:26,025
'Cause we cannot afford
to waste any more time.

39
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:27,266
What, 'cause we've just been

40
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:28,934
sipping Mai Tais since you got here?

41
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,502
I don't know what you been
sipping since I got here,

42
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:32,471
but Barry needs to get
better, stronger, faster.

43
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:34,707
We need to train to prepare for Zoom.

44
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:36,141
Oh, I see.

45
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:37,877
You haven't had your coffee this morning.

46
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,645
I had my coffee this morning.
Don't slurp.

47
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:41,080
Don't. Don't.

48
00:01:41,082 --> 00:01:44,283
Don't.

49
00:01:46,487 --> 00:01:49,021
Runaway chemical transport
truck heading south on Kester.

50
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:50,289
On it.

51
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,208
Hey, I can't stop the truck!

52
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,710
Somebody rigged it!

53
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:13,045
Sorry!

54
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:14,680
You can't let that truck crash.

55
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:16,115
If you do, you'll take
out a whole city block.

56
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,316
Great. Thank you.

57
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:19,585
Thank you for that.

58
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,390
That was close, that was close.

59
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:26,825
Oh, and the plot thickens.

60
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,193
Dead-end up ahead.

61
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:29,395
You got to get out of there!

62
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:30,521
Oh, come on.

63
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:33,309
Yes!

64
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:53,552
That one was a little close.

65
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:56,996
Nice! Now can you please,
please take a break?

66
00:02:58,359 --> 00:02:59,927
- How's that for training?
- Great.

67
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:02,728
Look, we're gonna catch Zoom.

68
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,563
We got Turtle locked up in the pipeline.

69
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:06,565
All we got to do is use him
to figure out how to steal

70
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:09,468
Zoom's speed and then we'll
get your daughter back.

71
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,770
That might take longer than we thought.

72
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:12,772
Why's that?

73
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,873
Because Turtle's dead.

74
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:20,179
Barry, we need you back here stat.

75
00:03:20,181 --> 00:03:21,547
All right. I'm on my way.

76
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:27,686
Gideon.

77
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,723
Was the trip a success, Professor Thawne?

78
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:34,826
I believe it was. I've finally figured
out what time period The Flash is from.

79
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:37,842
Now let's figure out a way to get home.

80
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,330
- sync and corrections by Caio -
<b><font color="#32a615">WEB-DL resync by</font> kinglouisxx</b>
- www.addic7ed.com -

81
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:46,681
He better not be pulling a Juliet.

82
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:49,741
Yeah, that's right. I see plays.

83
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:52,644
- He's dead, Cisco.
- How'd this happen?

84
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:55,714
Preliminary brain scan shows
an acute brain aneurysm.

85
00:03:55,716 --> 00:03:58,650
The night we captured him.
How's that for timing?

86
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:01,787
What does that mean? You
think I did this, Garrick?

87
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,223
This man is the key to us stopping Zoom,

88
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,524
the key to me saving my daughter.

89
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:06,959
Why would I want that?

90
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:08,927
Never understood why you
do anything, Harrison.

91
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:11,029
That's fine with me, Garrick.

92
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:13,283
Guys, look.

93
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,634
We need to figure out how to stop Zoom.

94
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,536
Everything we've tried so far has failed.

95
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:19,171
We need to start thinking
outside the box.

96
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:20,472
I mean, we haven't even figured out how

97
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:21,773
to close the breaches yet.

98
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,208
Maybe that's where we should start.

99
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,576
That's a good idea.

100
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:26,478
- I'll get on that.
- I'll help.

101
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:29,815
I've got to get to the CCPD.

102
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,821
I'll check in with you guys later.

103
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:31,831
Okay.

104
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:36,088
Every time you think that
Wells is on your team,

105
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,768
something happens that
makes you doubt it.

106
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:44,496
Hey, I just wanted to see if you
could run this trace for me.

107
00:04:44,498 --> 00:04:46,832
Someone messed with an ethanol
transport truck this morning.

108
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,854
They cut the brake line and
tampered with the gear shafts.

109
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:51,416
Okay, yeah.

110
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:53,029
Okay.

111
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:55,946
Wow. Backed up, huh?

112
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:57,931
I am, yeah.

113
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,812
Yeah, I guess I'll find
out what that's like

114
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:02,347
once I finish CSI school.

115
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:03,627
Yeah, you will.

116
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:05,171
- Yeah.
- I guess.

117
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,687
Look, Barry, I know that you're upset,

118
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:11,275
but I was hoping it wouldn't
be like this between us.

119
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:17,174
What did you think
it was gonna be like?

120
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:21,400
I ju... I just thought we could
at least talk before I left.

121
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:23,302
You're moving. I don't know.

122
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:27,441
I mean, it just doesn't feel like
there's much to talk about now, right?

123
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:30,111
I guess not.

124
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,314
Hi.

125
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,830
- Hey.
- Hey.

126
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:43,989
I sort of overheard some of that.

127
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,827
Patty's going to CSI
school in Midway City.

128
00:05:48,829 --> 00:05:51,129
She's moving in two days.

129
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,165
I mean, you don't have to let her leave.

130
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,700
She's wanted to be a CSI her whole life.

131
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,369
I'm not gonna stand in the way of that.

132
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:58,037
Hey.

133
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:02,808
What's wrong?

134
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,541
Just went to see Francine and...

135
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,012
she doesn't have much time.

136
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:08,775
I already said my good-byes, if...

137
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,041
If you want to do the same.

138
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:23,221
It's not gonna work.

139
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:27,635
Closing the breaches, that's
like solving Einstein's riddle.

140
00:06:28,068 --> 00:06:29,893
I solved Einstein's
riddle when I was ten.

141
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,503
Yeah, well, maybe Earth-2 Einstein

142
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:32,904
wasn't as clever as ours.

143
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,838
You realize this Earth
is my Earth-2, right?

144
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:38,244
Listen to this.

145
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:43,148
What if we can figure out
how to control my powers?

146
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,350
We could find Zoom, get the jump on him.

147
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:47,719
That's a good idea. You
should get on that.

148
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,221
I need your help, Harry.

149
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:50,989
What you need, Ramon,

150
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,724
is to figure out what
triggers your vibes.

151
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,760
Exactly, and I don't
know what triggers them.

152
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,495
It's completely inconsistent.
Sometimes it's when I touch

153
00:06:56,497 --> 00:06:59,664
something that belongs to a breacher,
sometimes it just happens.

154
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:02,000
There's always a cause. Cause, effect.

155
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:03,535
Doesn't take Einstein to figure that out.

156
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:05,804
Okay, so what is the cause?

157
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:07,339
You saw when I tried to vibe Dr. Light,

158
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:10,459
when I tried to vibe you,
took a while to work.

159
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:13,346
Yes.

160
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:16,115
Yes, it did.

161
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:17,885
Meet me in the Time Vault.

162
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,408
For what?

163
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:29,061
Hello?

164
00:07:31,532 --> 00:07:32,611
Hello?

165
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:36,565
Harry?

166
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,742
Of course, now he's gonna make me wait

167
00:07:43,744 --> 00:07:46,945
in this freaky-ass braille room.

168
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,583
Hi, Cisco.

169
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:53,652
Stop! Don't do that!

170
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:56,986
I figured out your trigger.

171
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:00,657
A rush of adrenaline.

172
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:04,033
Dopamine floods the brain.

173
00:08:05,866 --> 00:08:09,367
And the quickest way to
achieve that result...

174
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:12,605
Fear!

175
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:17,642
Do not move!

176
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:18,644
You can't be.

177
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:33,692
What did you see?

178
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:36,761
The Reverse-Flash.

179
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:37,763
He's here.

180
00:08:50,226 --> 00:08:51,826
Oh, my God!

181
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,061
Christina McGee.

182
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:55,441
Who are you?

183
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:57,743
You're coming with me.

184
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,777
Flash.

185
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,029
Eobard Thawne.

186
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,114
You know who I am?

187
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:04,116
You died!

188
00:09:04,118 --> 00:09:05,918
Good to know.

189
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,786
And guess what, Flash.

190
00:09:07,788 --> 00:09:10,147
I know what time period you're from.

191
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:15,894
So that means very soon... you will die.

192
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:29,475
No.

193
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:31,631
You okay, Bar?

194
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,446
I'm good, yeah. It's just a lot.

195
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:37,816
Eddie Thawne died, so Eobard Thawne

196
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:40,786
should have been erased
out of existence, right?

197
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,405
Not necessarily.

198
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:45,090
It's possible Eobard was
in the Speed Force,

199
00:09:45,092 --> 00:09:47,526
protecting him like a bomb shelter,

200
00:09:47,748 --> 00:09:49,261
keeping him alive and
his time line intact.

201
00:09:49,263 --> 00:09:51,330
It's what's known as a
"time line remnant"

202
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,831
A what now?

203
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,534
Here, let me... show you.

204
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:57,336
This?

205
00:09:57,338 --> 00:10:01,206
This... is now.

206
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,975
Here, today.

207
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,645
This is the time Thawne comes from.

208
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,783
This is the moment you all
erased him from existence,

209
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:13,185
but since Thawne is from the future,

210
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:16,321
this is where his time line begins.

211
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,123
That's why he's still alive.

212
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,858
This Thawne has not yet traveled back

213
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,460
in time to kill Barry's mother.

214
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,629
He's here now in this time
period for the first time.

215
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:25,197
"Time line remnant."

216
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:26,899
Explains why nothing's changed.

217
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:29,209
Yeah, it also explains why
he didn't know my name

218
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,247
or that we have met before.

219
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:33,338
To him, you hadn't. Not until the future.

220
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,842
If Thawne dies before he
can time travel again,

221
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,210
will that save Barry's mother?

222
00:10:38,212 --> 00:10:40,779
No. That's not how it works.

223
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,182
In our time line, Barry's
mother is already dead,

224
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,550
and her death is a fixed point.

225
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:45,818
Nothing can change that.

226
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,586
All right, well, I'm gonna end this,

227
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:49,688
him, in this time once and for all.

228
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,690
Let's find Dr. McGee,
then we'll figure out

229
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,393
what to do about Thawne, okay?

230
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:56,562
I got to go check on Iris.

231
00:10:58,889 --> 00:10:59,889
Ramon.

232
00:11:03,971 --> 00:11:05,804
Caitlin, I know you're
worried about Dr. McGee,

233
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:07,372
but we're gonna get her back.

234
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:09,264
It's not that. It's Jay.

235
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:10,442
What about Jay?

236
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:13,245
He's sick, and it's getting worse.

237
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:15,781
When Zoom stole his speed,

238
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:18,951
it affected him on a cellular level.

239
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,787
We need to do something about it.

240
00:11:20,788 --> 00:11:22,187
All right, like what?

241
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:25,090
I think we should replace his dying cells

242
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:27,811
with healthy ones
indistinguishable from his.

243
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:29,862
How do we do that?

244
00:11:30,178 --> 00:11:32,297
We find his Earth-1 doppelganger.

245
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,834
There.

246
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:37,269
Tachyons?

247
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:40,105
A man in a yellow suit tried to steal

248
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:43,675
another tachyon prototype last year.

249
00:11:43,677 --> 00:11:45,677
I must have gotten stuck here once before

250
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,114
and not been able to access
enough of the Speed Force.

251
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:50,415
Tachyons should do it.

252
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:51,850
I want you to isolate and accelerate

253
00:11:51,852 --> 00:11:53,485
their energetic properties for me.

254
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,053
I don't know if I can do that.

255
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:03,629
If you want to stay alive...

256
00:12:03,631 --> 00:12:04,997
learn.

257
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:16,748
Franny.

258
00:12:17,244 --> 00:12:19,022
Hey.

259
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,380
How you feeling today?

260
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,506
Better now.

261
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,381
I'm gonna let you two talk, okay?

262
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:29,795
Okay.

263
00:12:38,623 --> 00:12:40,432
Can I get you anything?

264
00:12:40,434 --> 00:12:42,467
Oh, just that brother of yours

265
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:45,897
so all of us can be together
for the first time.

266
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,053
Yeah, he should be here.

267
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:51,303
His mother is leaving him.

268
00:12:52,413 --> 00:12:55,436
Can't blame him for
being angry about that.

269
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,287
I just wish he'd get all that anger out

270
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:00,240
while I'm here to help.

271
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,451
Same thing goes for you, Iris.

272
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:06,525
One thing you learn when you're dying

273
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:09,787
is not to hold anything back.

274
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:13,806
You want to say something to me?

275
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:17,369
You need to say it while you can.

276
00:13:26,547 --> 00:13:30,053
I have so many great memories
from when I grew up.

277
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,685
Now when I think about those memories,

278
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,520
I can only wonder what
it would have been like

279
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:37,569
if you and Wally would have been there.

280
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm not angry at
you anymore for what happened.

281
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:48,667
I just wish you would have
come back to us a lot sooner.

282
00:13:50,804 --> 00:13:52,933
Because I would have forgiven you then...

283
00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:55,745
just like I'm forgiving you now.

284
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,078
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,441
Thank you. Thank you.

286
00:14:18,465 --> 00:14:20,165
I don't know why this is so hard.

287
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,867
I barely even know her.

288
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,309
The facial recognition
software at S.T.A.R. Labs

289
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:32,811
didn't find anything either.

290
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:34,846
No, but there's still
more databases to check.

291
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:36,281
We'll find his doppelganger.

292
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:37,649
- Thanks, Barry.
- Yeah.

293
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:40,471
Hey. Hi, Caitlin.

294
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:41,621
Hi.

295
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:43,955
Can we... talk?

296
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,590
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

297
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:47,559
I'll let you know what I find.

298
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:48,815
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

299
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,019
What's up?

300
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,499
I didn't know you were
working with S.T.A.R. Labs.

301
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,846
Yeah, um, uh, yeah.

302
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:01,353
Joe and I help out every once in a while.

303
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:02,673
Really?

304
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:04,776
Yeah, I probably shouldn't tell you this,

305
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:08,595
but there's a lot of weird
stuff that happens over there.

306
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,806
Is that what you came to tell me?

307
00:15:18,492 --> 00:15:22,267
You're just rolling with the
whole "me leaving" thing.

308
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:25,664
Yeah, well, I don't know
what to tell you, Patty.

309
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:30,168
Everyone in my life that I
love leaves at some point.

310
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,003
Kind of getting used to it.

311
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:35,888
You... never told me you loved me.

312
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,845
Yeah, I guess I don't
get that chance now.

313
00:15:39,847 --> 00:15:41,972
I don't understand.

314
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:44,950
What is it? What's going on with you?

315
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:46,551
Why are you being like this?

316
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:49,454
My life is complicated,
and I don't want you

317
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,789
to have regrets, all right?

318
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,591
I don't want you to miss out

319
00:15:52,593 --> 00:15:54,693
on something that you've
always wanted to do.

320
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:59,097
And I wish that things were different

321
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:00,707
for both of us.

322
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:04,058
You know, but they're not.

323
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:07,405
Sorry.

324
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:10,575
Me too.

325
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,292
So what did you do to my goggles?

326
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:29,795
I added a wavelength trigger

327
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:33,231
to stimulate the fear
receptors in your brain.

328
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:36,401
Then I took what you already
had to induce slow-wave sleep,

329
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:38,570
upgraded it to get you
to stage-four sleep.

330
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:39,938
No, this is good.

331
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,768
- This will give us more control.
- Okay.

332
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:44,442
Now I'll be able to dictate
how long you vibe for.

333
00:16:45,043 --> 00:16:46,066
Put 'em on.

334
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:47,712
What am I gonna see?

335
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,714
I don't know. Never done this before.

336
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,566
You'll have to tell me so I can
steer you where you need to be.

337
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:57,238
Ramon, you want to find Reverse-Flash,

338
00:16:57,991 --> 00:16:59,675
put on the goggles.

339
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:04,082
- Okay.
- Attaboy.

340
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:09,602
Go ahead.

341
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,545
Oh-ho-ho, yeah, man.

342
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,914
I'm in full-on vibe mode right now.

343
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,183
- What do you see?
- It's hard to explain.

344
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:27,152
It's different events.

345
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:28,987
Different events in time.

346
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:31,690
Concentrate on The Reverse-Flash.

347
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:33,825
Okay.

348
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,096
I see him.

349
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,298
Move toward him.

350
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:44,269
Okay, now what?

351
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:48,874
Try to picture him with Christina McGee.

352
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:51,843
Where the hell am I?

353
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:55,180
It's charged. You can go now.

354
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:57,249
You said you'd release me.

355
00:17:57,251 --> 00:17:59,818
Yes, I did. Didn't I?

356
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:03,696
No!

357
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:11,485
Well, what is it?

358
00:18:12,478 --> 00:18:14,478
She's dead.

359
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,793
Dr. McGee is dead?

360
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,691
Harry and I were trying to
hone my powers to find Zoom,

361
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:29,173
and then we ended up using them,
finding The Reverse-Flash,

362
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:31,926
and that's when I saw him kill her.

363
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:34,262
And then he left.

364
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:36,064
He left? What do you mean, he left?

365
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,700
McGee built him some
kind of speed machine

366
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,469
and he ran into and got
flung back to the future.

367
00:18:43,273 --> 00:18:45,507
You'd need superluminal energy
to send someone through time.

368
00:18:45,509 --> 00:18:47,776
- You mean like tachyons?
- Tachyons.

369
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:51,312
We can track their location
once they've been activated.

370
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:56,317
Anything? Nothing.

371
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,253
Cisco, you're sure that's what you saw?

372
00:18:58,255 --> 00:18:59,854
- I'm positive.
- All right.

373
00:18:59,856 --> 00:19:01,356
What else did you see?

374
00:19:01,358 --> 00:19:03,158
There was all sorts of
weird tech everywhere.

375
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,492
There was a clock.

376
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:08,163
What time did the clock say?

377
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:09,697
9:52, I think.

378
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:10,999
How... how is that relevant?

379
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:14,502
It's 6:00 now.

380
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:16,471
Are you telling me I can see the future?

381
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:17,972
That's exactly what I'm telling you.

382
00:19:17,974 --> 00:19:19,808
Those goggles are getting
named immediately.

383
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,609
But that means Dr. McGee is alive.

384
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:23,311
- That's right.
- Yeah, okay.

385
00:19:23,313 --> 00:19:26,381
We have 3 hours, 52 minutes to
find her and stop Reverse-Flash.

386
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:27,649
Let's do it.

387
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,854
- Spivot.
- Hey.

388
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:34,622
Can't get away from
those case files, huh?

389
00:19:34,624 --> 00:19:36,825
Oh, just following up on a hunch.

390
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:38,707
You're gonna miss the action, right?

391
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:40,620
Maybe. A little.

392
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:44,917
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Miss you too.

393
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:48,136
- It's nice to know someone will.
- Wait, we talking about Barry?

394
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:50,238
'Cause it sounds like we're
talking about Barry.

395
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,207
He kept telling
me there was stuff

396
00:19:52,209 --> 00:19:55,243
he couldn't share with me and
I've been going a little crazy

397
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:57,011
trying to figure out what that stuff is.

398
00:19:57,013 --> 00:20:00,285
Yeah, Barry's not great at sharing.

399
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,051
- Neither are you.
- What do you mean?

400
00:20:03,053 --> 00:20:05,086
Barry just told me that, you know,

401
00:20:05,088 --> 00:20:08,857
sometimes he helps you out with S.T.A.R.
Labs stuff.

402
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,459
Yeah, he does when he has
a few extra minutes.

403
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,894
I didn't know that.

404
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:14,929
I mean, the whole time
I've been working here

405
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:19,868
you never mentioned it to me,
but then I realized why.

406
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:22,604
I went through some of Barry's old cases.

407
00:20:22,606 --> 00:20:25,907
All of them involved The
Flash saving the day

408
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:30,912
with details that Barry couldn't
have possibly even known.

409
00:20:30,914 --> 00:20:33,281
That's weird.

410
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:36,232
Yeah, it... It is weird.

411
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,807
The only thing that does make sense

412
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,590
is that Barry is The Flash.

413
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:43,861
Have you ever seen Barry run?

414
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:46,528
He waddles like a slow-ass duck.

415
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,196
There's no way he's The Flash, Patty.

416
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:49,731
You know, when I started this job,

417
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:52,667
you told me I had to learn
how to lie to do it.

418
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,802
You're a terrible liar, Joe.

419
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,174
See you.

420
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:08,583
Nice nitrous kit.

421
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:10,051
You're gonna get caught
one of these days.

422
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:11,925
You know that, right? Get thrown in jail?

423
00:21:12,822 --> 00:21:15,425
I'll stop racing when these
hospital bills stop coming in.

424
00:21:16,126 --> 00:21:19,079
I saw Mom today. She says you
haven't been by in a while.

425
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:20,261
Yeah, she knows why.

426
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:22,063
She thinks it's because
you're angry with her.

427
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:24,399
I have every right to be angry.

428
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:26,801
Nothing for 20 years,
then out of nowhere,

429
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:28,870
she tells me I have a sister, I have...
I have a father.

430
00:21:28,872 --> 00:21:31,272
Yeah, the same thing happened
to me too, remember?

431
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:32,941
But that shouldn't keep
you from seeing her

432
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,277
before you can't anymore.

433
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:37,045
No. Look... that's not what it is.

434
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,852
Then what is it, Wally?

435
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,382
I got to go.

436
00:21:42,652 --> 00:21:45,011
Last year, my fiancé died...

437
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,690
unexpectedly.

438
00:21:49,593 --> 00:21:53,378
One moment he was here, the next... gone.

439
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:57,165
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye to him,

440
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,073
to tell everything he meant to me,

441
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:00,878
That he was my world...

442
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:03,620
that he was loved.

443
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,542
But today I got to say
good-bye to your mom.

444
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:08,911
My mom.

445
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,846
And it helped us both find peace

446
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:13,589
with what happened to our family.

447
00:22:14,184 --> 00:22:15,750
Wally, don't make a mistake
you're gonna regret

448
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:17,685
the rest of your life.

449
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:21,222
Go see your mom while you still can.

450
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,033
No sign of tachyon activity.

451
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:34,202
We're running out of time.
We've got to find them.

452
00:22:34,204 --> 00:22:36,237
It'll take a few minutes for
the device to reach full power

453
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,705
once it's activated, but when we find it,

454
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:39,607
you're gonna have to get there fast.

455
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,301
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah?

456
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,351
Have you found out anything
else about Jay's doppelganger?

457
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:47,240
There's no Jay Garrick on this Earth.

458
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:50,231
That's so weird. Everyone
has a doppelganger.

459
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,359
Maybe just ask Jay.

460
00:22:53,102 --> 00:22:54,196
He's a good guy.

461
00:22:54,524 --> 00:22:57,025
Just ask him. I'm sure he'll tell you.

462
00:22:57,707 --> 00:22:58,707
Okay.

463
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,988
Hey. Hold on.

464
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:03,032
What's up?

465
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,302
We got a problem. Patty
knows you're The Flash.

466
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:09,037
- What?
- She caught me off guard.

467
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,406
I mean, I played it off, but
come on, she's a smart girl.

468
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:12,707
Anyway, she was going
through some case files

469
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:13,941
and you were acting all squirrely.

470
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:15,510
This is my fault now?

471
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,478
- No, it's nobody's fault.
- Oh, my God.

472
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:19,982
- Maybe you should tell her.
- No.

473
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:22,183
- Patty's trustworthy.
- It's not even about that, Joe.

474
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:25,987
I-I don't want another person
that Zoom or Reverse-Flash

475
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:29,357
or any of these meta-humans
can use against me.

476
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,427
I don't want it. Patty
can't get hurt over this.

477
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,175
Tachyons! 87th and Avenue J.

478
00:23:41,137 --> 00:23:43,037
Must be one of Mercury
Labs' off-site facilities.

479
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,238
Hack into their se...

480
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,807
I've hacked in the security feed.

481
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:47,875
- And once that...
- I'm one step ahead of you.

482
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,615
Barry, hurry up!

483
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:56,651
It's charged.

484
00:23:56,653 --> 00:24:00,154
You can go now.

485
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:02,824
You said you'd release me.

486
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:05,626
Yes, I did. Didn't I?

487
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,731
He's gonna kill her.

488
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:21,109
- You okay?
- Yeah.

489
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,377
Okay, get out of here, all right?

490
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:24,178
Go! Go!

491
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:30,138
That was my way home!

492
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,054
You're not going anywhere.

493
00:24:38,822 --> 00:24:40,088
You haven't won here, Flash.

494
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,523
I'll find another way back.

495
00:24:42,427 --> 00:24:44,427
You're gonna have to
get through me first.

496
00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:46,629
You really think you're
fast enough to stop me?

497
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:49,198
Let's find out.

498
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
Catch me if you can.

499
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:55,405
Oh, it's on.

500
00:25:10,622 --> 00:25:12,321
Get him, Bar.

501
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:24,801
Not fast enough, Thawne.

502
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:26,502
I will never lose to you again.

503
00:25:33,878 --> 00:25:36,245
This war between us, it ends now!

504
00:25:38,316 --> 00:25:40,650
Bar, you got to stop!

505
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:43,319
Bar, don't kill him! Just bring him in!

506
00:25:50,862 --> 00:25:51,894
Get the cell ready.

507
00:25:58,582 --> 00:26:00,768
Hey, he can't...?

508
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:03,473
Phase his way out? No, he can't do that.

509
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:05,635
It's the same cell we used to hold Dr.
Wells last year.

510
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,310
Barry, where you going?

511
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:09,130
- I'm going down there.
- No, you're not.

512
00:26:09,914 --> 00:26:11,247
The more he learns about you,

513
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:12,648
the more you will alter the time line.

514
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,317
He killed my mom!

515
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,818
He's from the future. He
hasn't done that yet.

516
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,086
He doesn't even know you're The Flash,

517
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:18,521
and you need to keep it that way.

518
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:19,655
You already said that his mother's

519
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:21,157
gonna die no matter what we do.

520
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,392
There's ramifications
any time anybody messes

521
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:25,194
with the time line, and
it's impossible to predict

522
00:26:25,196 --> 00:26:27,330
what those ramifications are going to be.

523
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:29,398
Barry, you caught him and you stopped him

524
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,934
from killing Dr. McGee.

525
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:33,870
In my book, that's a win.

526
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:35,538
This doesn't feel like a win.

527
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:40,142
I got to go.

528
00:26:53,802 --> 00:26:55,430
So, what'd you want to talk to me about?

529
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:00,368
My dad had multiple sclerosis.

530
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:04,467
Every day for years, I watched

531
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:09,739
this amazingly strong man fight
for his life... and lose.

532
00:27:09,741 --> 00:27:14,343
So, I can't sit by and watch
another man I care about

533
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:17,747
fight for his life and not
do something about it.

534
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,749
I tried to find your doppelganger.

535
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:22,496
Same DNA, same cellular structure.

536
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:27,227
I could replace your dying
cells with his living ones.

537
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,896
But... you don't have a
doppelganger on this Earth.

538
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,571
Caitlin, there is a good explanation.

539
00:27:36,181 --> 00:27:38,601
Meet me at Hofherr Park
tomorrow and I'll show you.

540
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:39,936
Why can't you just tell me?

541
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:41,946
Because you need to see for yourself.

542
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:59,288
How'd you get your suit in your ring?

543
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,424
Who are you?

544
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,059
My name is Cisco Ramon.

545
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:05,494
And we know each other well, don't we?

546
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:06,796
We have a history together.

547
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,064
You could say that.

548
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:10,166
And that's all you want to know?

549
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:13,035
How I got my suit in my ring?

550
00:28:13,037 --> 00:28:16,105
I want you to know that I'm the one

551
00:28:16,107 --> 00:28:18,641
who figured out you were back.

552
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:21,410
I helped stop you.

553
00:28:21,412 --> 00:28:23,479
Me.

554
00:28:23,481 --> 00:28:24,614
And how'd you do that?

555
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:27,717
I have powers.

556
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:31,354
And I helped track you down
and I put you in here.

557
00:28:33,791 --> 00:28:36,525
That's quite the ability
you've been given.

558
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:39,929
And here's what's so ironic about it.

559
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:42,164
You gave me these powers.

560
00:28:44,268 --> 00:28:48,237
Have fun thinking about that
while you rot away in this cell

561
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:52,341
that you helped me build.

562
00:28:52,343 --> 00:28:53,743
Bye, Felicia.

563
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Hey.

564
00:29:21,472 --> 00:29:22,538
Hey.

565
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,906
Got your text.

566
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:25,975
I wasn't sure that you would see me,

567
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:28,044
considering you've been
avoiding me lately.

568
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,993
Patty, I haven't been avoiding you.

569
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:34,532
No, just, uh, busy...

570
00:29:35,553 --> 00:29:37,735
you know, speeding around Central City.

571
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:43,192
- I know you're The Flash, Barry.
- Patty, come on.

572
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:45,194
Please don't make me feel any more stupid

573
00:29:45,196 --> 00:29:46,629
than I already do.

574
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,297
Look, I'm a detective and
I should have known.

575
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:51,167
I was just... I was so smitten with you.

576
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:53,102
Okay, look, what...

577
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:54,852
What you're saying, it's insane.

578
00:29:55,073 --> 00:29:57,506
Look, you don't have to
lie to me anymore, okay?

579
00:29:57,508 --> 00:30:01,410
I understand... I understand why
you didn't want to tell me.

580
00:30:01,412 --> 00:30:02,912
I understand why you've been distant.

581
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:04,580
Look, I understand everything.

582
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,549
But just tell me the truth now.

583
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:08,150
Just be honest with me.

584
00:30:08,152 --> 00:30:12,988
Just... admit to me you're
The Flash and I'll stay.

585
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,458
I can't do that. I'm not him.

586
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:21,623
It's too bad. It would
have been nice to stay.

587
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:24,366
Fight crime during the day

588
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:26,168
and be with you at night.

589
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,970
But I was... I was wrong.

590
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:29,171
Take care, Barry.

591
00:30:42,787 --> 00:30:45,329
Is that you, Flash?

592
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:48,063
Why do you hate me so much?

593
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:50,610
I didn't always.

594
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:56,398
I was obsessed with you.

595
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,609
For so long, I wanted to be The Flash.

596
00:31:00,169 --> 00:31:02,974
I spent years figuring
out how you came to be.

597
00:31:04,308 --> 00:31:08,243
Duplicated the reaction... and it worked.

598
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,523
I became like you.

599
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:14,165
Right, so what happened?

600
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:19,477
This ability to travel through
time revealed a truth.

601
00:31:20,424 --> 00:31:23,492
My fate was to become
your greatest enemy.

602
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:26,000
I was never going to be The Flash,

603
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:29,038
so I became the reverse of
everything that you were.

604
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:33,235
The more people you saved,
the more you were loved,

605
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:35,304
the more I had to take from you.

606
00:31:35,306 --> 00:31:38,461
That is why you killed my mother?

607
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:41,219
That's why you ruined my life?

608
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,780
Because you couldn't be me?

609
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:46,555
I became better than you!

610
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:53,255
I am the one thing you
cannot stop, Flash!

611
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:55,858
No, no, no.

612
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,326
Not anymore.

613
00:31:57,328 --> 00:31:58,383
Our race is over.

614
00:32:00,198 --> 00:32:01,282
And you lost.

615
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:06,302
I've learned what time
period you're from, Flash.

616
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:10,406
And one day soon, I'll learn your name.

617
00:32:13,544 --> 00:32:15,548
We need you in the cortex now!

618
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,253
What's happening?

619
00:32:24,255 --> 00:32:25,487
He's experiencing an
uncontrollable amount

620
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:27,156
of electrical energy in his brain,

621
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,358
putting him in a prolonged
state of chronic seizing.

622
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:30,583
What? Can you stop it?

623
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:32,005
I don't know.

624
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:41,604
- Hold him down!
- We're trying!

625
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:43,572
- Sedate him, Snow, now!
- Come on! Come on!

626
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:45,608
Benzodiazepine. This should do it.

627
00:32:51,212 --> 00:32:52,212
Finally.

628
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:56,516
What? What was that?

629
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,651
What's going on? Where the hell am I?

630
00:32:58,653 --> 00:33:00,386
- Cisco!
- It's the time line.

631
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:01,988
What? What are you talking about?

632
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,290
When you... when you
captured Reverse-Flash,

633
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:05,858
we ruptured the time line.
That's what this...

634
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,361
All the blood and the
seizures and that and all...

635
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:11,064
Cisco is being affected to... to...

636
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:12,665
By the changes to the time line.

637
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,400
The changes to the past or the
changes to the present...

638
00:33:14,402 --> 00:33:15,868
This is what this is. We
need to do something.

639
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,670
- We need to do it fast.
- Like what?

640
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:19,005
We need to restore the time line.

641
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:21,007
Barry, you need to get Reverse-Flash

642
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:23,009
and send him back to the
future as quickly as possible.

643
00:33:23,011 --> 00:33:24,544
- What? Are you...
- Barry...

644
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,179
I just caught him! You
want me to let him go?

645
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,214
Keeping him here is killing Cisco!

646
00:33:28,216 --> 00:33:29,916
Barry, if this is the
only way we can save him,

647
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:31,284
you got to do it!

648
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:33,086
- You got to let go of Thawne!
- I can't.

649
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:34,687
Okay, all right, look.

650
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:36,789
I destroyed the tachyon
drive in the speed machine.

651
00:33:36,791 --> 00:33:38,391
There's no way it'll
reach a speed necessary

652
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:39,559
to send him back home.

653
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,094
- You can.
- What?

654
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:43,362
Your speed coupled with Thawne's speed,

655
00:33:43,364 --> 00:33:45,798
that'll be enough to catapult
him through the time continuum.

656
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,166
You can do it.

657
00:33:50,004 --> 00:33:51,237
All right. All right.

658
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,573
Let's do it. Let's do it.

659
00:33:58,813 --> 00:33:59,879
Time to send you home.

660
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:02,282
The time paradox. Yeah.

661
00:34:02,717 --> 00:34:05,157
You've all messed with something
you don't understand.

662
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:08,154
Can you do me a favor and just shut up?

663
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:14,160
And how exactly are you
going to send me home?

664
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:15,375
Don't worry about it.

665
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:17,727
You fixed Dr. McGee's tachyon device?

666
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,400
No, I came up with a different method.

667
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:25,638
Is that so?

668
00:34:27,742 --> 00:34:28,808
Who are you?

669
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:37,250
No one of consequence.

670
00:34:37,252 --> 00:34:39,852
No.

671
00:34:39,854 --> 00:34:41,020
I doubt that.

672
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:48,461
I win again, Flash.

673
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:51,631
All you have to do is provide
him with enough momentum

674
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,299
to get him past the space-time barrier.

675
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,735
- All right.
- Hey, listen to me.

676
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:58,404
Thawne knows about you.

677
00:34:58,406 --> 00:35:01,207
Right here, right now.

678
00:35:01,209 --> 00:35:04,043
This is where he learns
about you, all of you.

679
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:05,678
It's how he knows about S.T.A.R. Labs,

680
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,547
how he knows about me...

681
00:35:07,549 --> 00:35:09,348
The Harrison Wells from this Earth.

682
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,784
And there's nothing I can do about it.

683
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:13,386
There's nothing you can do about it.

684
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:17,323
This is his origin story,

685
00:35:17,325 --> 00:35:20,727
and it's going to happen
no matter what you do.

686
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:25,180
But right here, right now...

687
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,196
you can send him back to his time.

688
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,037
You can save your friend.

689
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,908
You can save Cisco and then
move on with your life.

690
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,077
This could be a good thing.

691
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,713
You can finally let go of him.

692
00:35:40,715 --> 00:35:42,715
I could throw him three
centuries from now.

693
00:35:42,717 --> 00:35:44,083
He'll always be a part of me.

694
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,622
Time to send you back where you belong.

695
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,164
We'll meet again soon, Flash.

696
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,699
I know.

697
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,501
And every time, I'll be ready for you.

698
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,990
Hurry.

699
00:36:50,618 --> 00:36:51,918
He did it.

700
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,840
He's gonna be okay.

701
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:25,603
I don't understand what we're doing here.

702
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:27,467
Well, just like you, I
thought that if I could find

703
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:29,436
my doppelganger on this Earth,

704
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:32,839
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

705
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:35,676
And believe me, I was
just as shocked as you

706
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:38,345
when I couldn't find a
Jay Garrick anywhere

707
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:39,391
on this planet.

708
00:37:41,984 --> 00:37:45,508
Took me a while to figure it out...

709
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:47,516
but eventually I found him.

710
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,893
His name is Hunter Zolomon.

711
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,461
Hunter Zolomon?

712
00:37:54,463 --> 00:37:56,229
Why doesn't he have the same name as you?

713
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:57,497
From what I could gather,

714
00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:59,433
his mother died during childbirth.

715
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:01,435
He bounced around from family to family,

716
00:38:01,437 --> 00:38:04,304
but eventually was adopted
and raised by the Zolomons.

717
00:38:07,657 --> 00:38:09,618
But why does that mean he can't help you?

718
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:12,954
My DNA was mutated when
I became a speedster.

719
00:38:14,617 --> 00:38:17,751
There's only one way to reverse
what's happening to me.

720
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,055
If we can catch Zoom, I
can get my speed back.

721
00:38:22,057 --> 00:38:25,826
Then let's finally figure out
the best way to do that.

722
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,806
- Wally, hi.
- Hey.

723
00:38:39,808 --> 00:38:42,175
Do you want to come in?

724
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:44,077
No, I-I can't stay. I just...

725
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,580
I wanted to tell you that
I'm gonna take your advice

726
00:38:46,582 --> 00:38:47,852
and go see my mom.

727
00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:49,884
Okay.

728
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,223
Iris, I was... I was wondering

729
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:58,370
if you would come with me.

730
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:01,518
Yeah, yeah, I would... I would love that.

731
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,163
- Yeah?
- Okay.

732
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:14,299
My head feels like it's in a vise.

733
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:18,549
What happened?

734
00:39:20,182 --> 00:39:22,807
I think you vibed one
too many dimensions.

735
00:39:23,085 --> 00:39:25,152
Maybe I should stop doing that.

736
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,221
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

737
00:39:28,223 --> 00:39:32,192
How did you... get
the vibing to stop?

738
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:34,643
We sent Thawne back to his time.

739
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:38,026
You let him go?

740
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,480
I couldn't let him take
another person I cared about.

741
00:39:44,606 --> 00:39:46,510
- Thank you.
- Of course.

742
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:51,278
Okay, I think I need a Big Belly burger.

743
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,946
- Anyone?
- I'm good, thank you.

744
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:55,682
- Yeah, no pickles.
- Two triple triples, please.

745
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,017
You got money?

746
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:01,062
Rest up, all right? I'll be out here.

747
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:07,694
So, Patty... she's on a train
to Midway City right now, huh?

748
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,430
Mm-hmm, I had to let her go too.

749
00:40:10,432 --> 00:40:13,934
Mm-hmm, I was thinking
about what you said,

750
00:40:13,936 --> 00:40:18,371
that part of being The Flash
is that you have the ability

751
00:40:18,373 --> 00:40:21,341
to do amazing things
that nobody else can do.

752
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:23,376
And we see now that a
hundred years from now,

753
00:40:23,378 --> 00:40:25,145
you'll still be doing them.

754
00:40:25,147 --> 00:40:26,463
But the other part is,

755
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:29,175
you're gonna be loaded with sacrifices,

756
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:33,216
and you're gonna have
hard choices to make,

757
00:40:33,288 --> 00:40:36,893
and there's gonna be a lot
of things where eventually

758
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,760
you'll have to let 'em go.

759
00:40:40,662 --> 00:40:42,065
You got to be ready for that.

760
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,074
I am. I'm ready.

761
00:40:48,604 --> 00:40:49,604
That's my boy.

762
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:56,973
That's weird.

763
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,881
- Hey.
- Barry, I'm on the train.

764
00:41:00,883 --> 00:41:02,682
There's a... there's a man with a gun.

765
00:41:02,684 --> 00:41:05,652
All right, hold on.
I-I-I'll get you help.

766
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:15,698
- Is everyone okay?
- Everyone's fine.

767
00:41:17,497 --> 00:41:19,239
It was a false alarm, but...

768
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:22,903
thanks for coming so fast, Flash.

769
00:41:28,744 --> 00:41:31,342
Just want to make sure
everything's okay before I go.

770
00:41:33,382 --> 00:41:34,682
Don't worry.

771
00:41:35,617 --> 00:41:36,917
Everything's good.

772
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:54,535
Good-bye, Barry.
