1
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:24,067
- Why do you do that?
- What?

2
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:25,329
- The never leaving
things out thing?

3
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:26,896
We've lived together
for a month,

4
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,072
and you've never once left
anything out in the apartment

5
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,856
- Are you kidding me?
Do you not see us?

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,033
- Come and search me, po-po.
- Is that an undercover thing?

7
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,035
- Nah, I learned it
before that.

8
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,558
It's a 32 foster homes thing.

9
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:38,081
You want to survive,
you keep it tight.

10
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:39,474
Play by the rules.

11
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:41,128
- Yo, look who it is!
Nina!

12
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:44,348
What up, rat?
- What's up, Bryce?

13
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,176
How many times you think
we're gonna have to explain

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,526
the difference between
undercover officer and snitch?

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,572
- Thanks.
- No, thanks, I'm good.

16
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:51,703
- Sorry.
Habit.

17
00:00:51,747 --> 00:00:54,054
- Sure,
that's one name for it.

18
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,794
- What do we got?

19
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,231
- Turf dispute.

20
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:58,841
Corner boy was dealing
south end of the courts.

21
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:00,451
It sounds like he ran into
another corner boy,

22
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:01,974
this one dealing unsanctioned.

23
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:04,020
Witnesses say they heard
yelling and then gunshots.

24
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,978
- He's young.
- Seventeen.

25
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:08,590
Multiple GSWs.
Torso, shin, back.

26
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,201
Wild, sporadic shots
he was running.

27
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:12,681
ID puts him living out
in Maywood,

28
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,857
so he was dealing
a long way from home.

29
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,206
- Anything on the shooter?

30
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,729
- Yeah, he's over here.

31
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:19,079
Kids shot each other.

32
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,384
Guns were still warm

33
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:22,082
when paramedics and patrol
rolled up.

34
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,570
- These boys were fighting to
survive for the same territory.

35
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:35,747
Both pulled out their guns,
both dead at 17.

36
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,054
- No doubt Homicide's gonna
rule this mutual combatants.

37
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,577
Why'd they call us?

38
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,926
- I don't know.

39
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,145
We're guessing it's got to do

40
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,016
with whatever the hell's
going on over there.

41
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,280
- All right, come on.
- Okay.

42
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:48,151
- We've got a bit
of a situation.

43
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:51,241
Unsanctioned corner boy who
was shot wasn't dealing dope.

44
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:53,591
He was dealing carfentanil.

45
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,202
- It's confirmed?

46
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:59,031
- Stamps on the drugs match
bags ISP identified last week.

47
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:02,122
Strain about 100 times
stronger than fentanyl.

48
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:03,427
Pinhead of this stuff
will kill you,

49
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:05,168
and whoever's dealing it

50
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:06,300
they're cutting it
with soap,

51
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:07,692
they're cutting it
with cat litter.

52
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:10,173
So I guess they know
what they're doing.

53
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:11,740
- He's still lying?
He's there?

54
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:14,264
- All right, Intelligence
can back Narcotics.

55
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:16,223
- No, no.
I want you running this.

56
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:18,312
Narcotics has had it
for a week, and all we got

57
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:20,792
are these two 17-year-old
corner boys now dead.

58
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,621
- Long-term drug investigations
from dead bottom take time.

59
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:27,451
- This batch has four ODs.
We're fresh out of time.

60
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,061
If carfentanil
truly hits Chicago,

61
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:31,368
we're gonna be stacking
dead bodies in freezer trucks

62
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:33,501
outside the morgue.

63
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:36,156
- You want me to try and jump
a few rungs on the ladder?

64
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,158
- I sure as hell hope you can.

65
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,943
It's his neighborhood.

66
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:42,988
Get it done.

67
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:55,523
- Work hard, okay?

68
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:08,405
- That is a long drive
from home for ballet class.

69
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,062
I know how to do heat runs,
Darius.

70
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,585
No one followed me.

71
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,240
You're a cooperating defendant.
You're no good to me dead.

72
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:23,377
Oh, I assume you remember
the deal we made.

73
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:30,862
It's time to start working
for the police.

74
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,561
Look, the way this works,

75
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:37,347
I come to you with a case
and you help.

76
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,349
Help goes in your file,

77
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,918
keeps you out of jail
until the next time I show up.

78
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:45,050
- You don't have to work
so hard to be polite.

79
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:47,357
I get it.
I'm a snitch.

80
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:50,969
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

81
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,711
I need the name of whoever's
running carfentanil

82
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,365
unsanctioned
in your neighborhood.

83
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:00,240
- Don't know it.
- Hmm.

84
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,154
That's the wrong answer.

85
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,678
You see, if you don't know it,

86
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,768
I just keep coming back until
you find it, you understand?

87
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:08,552
Darius.

88
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:12,164
I'm making this first one
real easy.

89
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,557
It's one thing to deal dope,

90
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:16,734
a whole other
dealing carfentanil.

91
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:18,823
You and I both know there's
no way you want that crap

92
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:21,739
on the streets
of your neighborhood.

93
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:25,090
So just give me a name
and I'm gone.

94
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:35,231
Idiot kid's testing
his new product at the courts.

95
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,190
Name's Book Barr.

96
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:40,236
- See how easy that is?

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,759
Thank you.

98
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,895
- So the tip Darius gave us
checks out.

99
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:49,593
Book Barr, 26,
with a long-ass rap sheet.

100
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,160
He's got two pops
for possession,

101
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:53,902
one with intent to distribute,
and a domestic on the side.

102
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,904
- Narcotics has him listed
as a current frequent

103
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:57,340
to Washington Courts,

104
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,473
and he has a hook into
our unsanctioned corner boy.

105
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:00,778
They grew up together
in Maywood.

106
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,214
This is our guy.

107
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:03,825
- Do we have a last known?
- No.

108
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,262
And no registered cell phone,
no social media, keeps low.

109
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,611
- Other than
our dead corner boy,

110
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:09,700
this guy's got a big zero
in associates.

111
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,920
Everybody he's been booked
with is long dead.

112
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:14,401
CHRIS system's got him linked
to three separate gangs,

113
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,490
AKA they couldn't pin
who he was working with.

114
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,230
- All right, so he must go
where the weight is.

115
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,362
Sounds like he's independent.

116
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:20,798
He's cutting
and supplying it himself.

117
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,191
- If he doesn't have any boys,

118
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:24,280
then there's not gonna be
anybody for us to work.

119
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,542
- Well, then we make
an access point,

120
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:27,501
but we gotta take this guy
quick and easy.

121
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:30,112
I think our best bet
is we set up a buy from him.

122
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,505
Anybody?

123
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,463
- I may have someone
that can set up an intro.

124
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,117
Old CI of mine out of Maywood.

125
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,119
I popped him when he was 18
on a burglary, flipped him,

126
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,034
then he fell in love
with working for the police.

127
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,035
Never stopped.

128
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:41,341
- He's like
a professional CI now?

129
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:42,820
- Yeah, he makes
a living shaking tips.

130
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:44,039
CPD, DEA, FBI.

131
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,084
You name letters,
he's sold to 'em.

132
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:47,608
- So what's the hesitation?

133
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,392
- If you ask me, he loves
the chase more than we do,

134
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,351
and it's not always worth
the trouble.

135
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,570
- Well, we need an in,
but he's your CI,

136
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,572
so it's your call.

137
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:57,487
Can you handle him?

138
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,184
- Yeah, I can handle him.

139
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:00,838
- Okay, let's go.

140
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,318
- Let's go.

141
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,842
- Cam.

142
00:06:04,886 --> 00:06:06,714
I'll be damned, be damned.

143
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:10,326
Hailey Ann Upton, light
of my sorry ass little life.

144
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,110
I knew you couldn't
stay away from me.

145
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,503
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:14,852
You're just playing hard
to get.

147
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,550
- It's not because I thought
you lost your mind?

148
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,726
- Nah, my mind still visits
from time to time.

149
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:21,076
We got one of them
timeshare things going.

150
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,686
So what's up?
We scraping together or what?

151
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,905
- Maybe.
- What you need?

152
00:06:23,948 --> 00:06:26,386
- An intro to a dealer,
Book Barr.

153
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:28,431
- Done.
- Really?

154
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,259
- Hell yeah.
Book Barr?

155
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:31,739
I use him like butter.

156
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:34,132
He a strange bird, though.
Hustles then dips.

157
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,525
Always changing color.

158
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,309
Guy don't like his ties
to last.

159
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,443
I can muscle an intro, but
price tag's gonna be steep.

160
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:42,227
- Of course it is.
- Value, baby.

161
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:43,577
I got it, I know it.

162
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,057
You pay me three,
I'm all yours.

163
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,537
- I'll pay you 500 now,

164
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,539
and 1500 when
we make an arrest.

165
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,758
- Plus two for every kilo
we seize.

166
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,412
- CPD's never gonna go
for that.

167
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,152
- Then pay me out your pocket.

168
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:55,676
What?
I know you.

169
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,591
You go to work, you go home.
What the hell are you buying?

170
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,114
- Ah, cute.
Not gonna happen.

171
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:01,464
Grand a key.
- 1500.

172
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:03,161
- 12 and you have to promise
to listen to me.

173
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,643
- Done.

174
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:07,949
You wanna shake on it?

175
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,429
Or we can have a quickie
to seal it.

176
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:10,604
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

177
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,170
- Come on,
we can have some fun.

178
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:14,434
- Uh-huh.

179
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:24,052
- What is this you're wearing?

180
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,402
- It's my going-out outfit.
- Yeah?

181
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,838
When is the last time
you went out?

182
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,840
- Youoh.

183
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:33,017
- Man, I missed you!
- And I did miss you.

184
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,629
Not too many people in my life
who know me anymore.

185
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:36,760
You play close to everyone

186
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,458
means you're not really close
to no one.

187
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,592
My new discovery.

188
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,289
Best place to do
a meet and greet

189
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,118
is surrounded by people so
damned diced out of they minds,

190
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,468
they can't think straight.

191
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,775
- Guy sounds like a cop.

192
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,212
- Thin line between
a pro CI and undercover.

193
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,044
I got eyes on Book.

194
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,962
- Copy, see it.
Haley, you guys are up.

195
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:07,530
- Yo, Book!

196
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,622
Book, been a minute, man.

197
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,145
How you doing?

198
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,147
- Why the hell you got me
meeting you here?

199
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,627
- Dollar beers!

200
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,847
And I swear, you stand in
one place long enough,

201
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,544
some girl's gonna
come rubbing up to you

202
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,720
telling you how soft
your hair is.

203
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,505
This is my friend I was telling
you about, Hailey.

204
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,723
- Hey.

205
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,464
- I met her up
in Brighton Park.

206
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,031
I tried dealing
her half-assed roxies,

207
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,902
then I realized
I was on her set.

208
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,079
- Cam says
you got something new.

209
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,646
I've been looking
for something new.

210
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,650
- Why's that?

211
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,957
- 'Cause new
usually means cheap.

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,654
- Man, you know
I wouldn't bring you no one

213
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,960
who couldn't back it.

214
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,352
She got demand,

215
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:48,571
and most of her demand
is white

216
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:50,225
and too stupid
to know street rates.

217
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,053
So we all can't go wrong.

218
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:55,578
- Yeah, I don't think no pretty
white girl can handle uncut.

219
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:59,147
- Huh, I'd actually pay more
for uncut.

220
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,545
20% uptick.

221
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,111
- What, you're gonna give
all your money

222
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,678
to a guy you don't know?

223
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:12,073
- Look, I already tried your
stuff from Washington Courts,

224
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:13,770
and I know Cam.

225
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,119
He says you're good,
you're good.

226
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,730
And I'm pretty sure
he's already told you

227
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:19,733
that I'm good,
so it's on you.

228
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,261
Yeah, all right.

229
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,003
I could use you.

230
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:32,006
Let me get a drink,
then we can talk.

231
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:47,151
- Why's it dealers
can't keep a clock?

232
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:50,938
- Let's take this extra time to
go over everything, shall we?

233
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:54,942
Drugs and cash exchange hands,
what do you do?

234
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,858
- I let your cop buddies crash
and beat me up real good,

235
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,600
and I don't swing back
too much.

236
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,689
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,179
- Yo, you see them numbers
on your phone?

238
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,616
They a clock.

239
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:17,791
- Yeah.

240
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,706
We got a bit
of a change in plans.

241
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,884
I want you to meet
my boy first.

242
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:27,496
If we cool, then we deal.

243
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:29,585
- What boy?
- Don't matter.

244
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,891
Guy I'm working with,
all right?

245
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,110
- The hell is this?

246
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,286
- He talking about his source?
- I don't know.

247
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,288
I guess nobody's truly
independent anymore.

248
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:38,812
- I thought we were doing
this today.

249
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,378
- We are.
We can go right now.

250
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,513
Why?
Is there a problem?

251
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,688
- Nah, it's cool.

252
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:46,776
Just don't love
being surprised.

253
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,343
- No, it is a problem.

254
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,432
I already talked price with you
and I'm not gonna debate it.

255
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:52,652
- No, I'm not gonna change
the price, all right?

256
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,479
I'm just...

257
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:55,785
I just want you to meet him.

258
00:10:58,483 --> 00:11:00,529
- Is everybody hearing this?

259
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,749
- Yeah.
We're good on GPS.

260
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:05,447
We're up on Hailey
and Cameron's COH and phones.

261
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,798
So if she wants to go mobile,
then we're good to go.

262
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,452
- Listen, I'm headed there now.

263
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,497
So you either in or you out.

264
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,372
- Fine.
In.

265
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,940
- Hey, back up.

266
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,855
Get in the front.

267
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:27,599
- All right, we're moving.

268
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:28,818
We're gonna take
the follow spot.

269
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,385
You guys run parallel,
stay wide,

270
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,692
don't lose the eye.
- Copy that.

271
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,437
- Where are we meeting him at?

272
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,917
You guys set a meet spot?

273
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:42,658
- It ain't far.

274
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,879
- Okay.

275
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:55,976
- Okay, we got Book
turning north on Parnell.

276
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:58,413
- Copy, we'll follow him
on South Normal.

277
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,079
- All right, looks like Book
is trailing a blue Civic.

278
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,776
We got to hang wide.
Kev, you up?

279
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,778
- Yes, sir.
Over and again now.

280
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:17,824
Two blocks over,
about to hit Lowe street.

281
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,100
- Is this the guy
we're meeting?

282
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:34,623
- You armed?

283
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,494
- Why the hell would
I need to be?

284
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:37,887
- Yo, Book, what's going on?

285
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:44,198
- Oh, we're not meeting anyone.
You're ripping.

286
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:45,852
- Whoa, whoa!
- Book!

287
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,425
- Hailey, down!

288
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,344
- Hurry, get down!
Stay down!

289
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:11,921
- Put the gun down!
Put the gun down!

290
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,532
- Chicago PD!
Drop your weapon!

291
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,883
Book, put the weapon down now!

292
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,193
Back up!

293
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,761
- Hailey?
- Hailey, you good?

294
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,197
- Stay back!
Stay back!

295
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,199
There's carfentanil all
over the street, it's uncut.

296
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,810
He's overdosing.
I need Narcan and gloves.

297
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,246
- Yeah, glove box.

298
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,813
5021 George.
Emergency.

299
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,554
We need hazmat, Fire, and an
ambulance to 65th and Parnell.

300
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:38,469
We got one OD victim,
possibly more.

301
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,123
We got uncut carfentanil
on the street.

302
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,256
Have patrol setup
a one-block perimeter...

303
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,866
- No, no, no!
You're staying here.

304
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,650
- It's too late.
We in it.

305
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,137
- Here, take these.

306
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:56,531
- Come on, let's do it.
Let's do it.

307
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,275
- Come on.
Come on.

308
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,847
It's not working.
Give me another one.

309
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,978
- Come on, man.
Stay in it.

310
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,066
Stay in it.
Come on, brother.

311
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,068
- Stay in it.

312
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,765
Come on.
Come on.

313
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:14,897
Don't go.
Come on.

314
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,681
Stay in it, stay in it,
stay in it.

315
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:33,742
.

316
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:36,701
- All right, levels are good.
You guys were lucky.

317
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:38,442
If you feel any worse symptoms

318
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:39,879
like dizziness
or shortness of breath,

319
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,532
then take another dose
and get to a hospital

320
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,970
just in case.
Understood?

321
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:48,496
- You good?
- Good.

322
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,628
You?
- Yeah.

323
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,282
Thanks for having my back.

324
00:14:52,326 --> 00:14:53,631
- I got you.

325
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,503
Front, center, sideways.

326
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,722
So what's our next play?

327
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,811
- I don't know.
- I do.

328
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:02,466
You go press the driver,
I'll go back.

329
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,815
I'll flip some cats,

330
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,426
ID whoever the hell
Book was ripping.

331
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:06,906
Damn idiot had to know them.

332
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:09,952
- No, it's not your call
and it's not mine either.

333
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,301
- Yo, that wasn't on us.

334
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,956
That thing flipped,
was chopped from the jump.

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,698
- Yeah, well, I gotta go
get my ass handed to me.

336
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,308
A tact officer's
gonna drive you home, okay?

337
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:19,919
- Whoa, whoa.

338
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,051
At least rap with me about
what our next move's gonna be.

339
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:24,010
- I can't, Cam.
You're a CI.

340
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,446
You can't be here.

341
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,752
You need to go now,
all right?

342
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,711
See you later.

343
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,107
- It looks like Book
was a one-man robbery crew,

344
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,935
ripping the supply of someone
he was working for.

345
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,849
- The driver of the Civic
was driving scared.

346
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:39,503
There was no way
this was Book's first rip.

347
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,244
My guess is he was told
to look out

348
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,680
for a black male tailing him.

349
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,508
- That's why he wanted
a white girl in the front seat.

350
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:45,814
- Gets him close enough
to do the rip,

351
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:48,338
then he kills Upton, her CI,
takes their cash,

352
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,818
doubles his score,

353
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,385
makes it look like
they did the rip.

354
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:52,908
No ties.

355
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,692
- Well, at least someone
was being smart.

356
00:15:54,736 --> 00:15:56,651
- We got 600 grams of
uncut carfentanil

357
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:58,261
and the driver in custody.

358
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,611
- And another body
and another street shut down.

359
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:02,396
- We got Book for you.

360
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:04,006
Just turned out
he was a small fish.

361
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,181
We'll get the big one.

362
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,922
We'll keep jumping the ladder.

363
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,707
It may not be pretty,
but it'll be worth it.

364
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,494
- That is what you told me.
- Uh-huh.

365
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:16,410
- All right.

366
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,631
- Driver of the Civic's
terrified.

367
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:23,721
Gave up his boss
as soon as we sat down.

368
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:26,724
This is Mackie Carter, 30.
The guy's a heavyweight.

369
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,030
- Heavy enough to have
six whole blocks.

370
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,553
He runs a section
of the G Park Lords,

371
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:30,902
deals dope, rocks, and loud.

372
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,687
And until now,
the driver said

373
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,297
that Book was
Mackie's enforcer.

374
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,864
He actually knew the routes.

375
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,953
- So Book steals uncut product
from his boss,

376
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,260
then cuts it himself and sells
it in Washington Courts.

377
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:41,870
Causes 4 ODs.

378
00:16:41,913 --> 00:16:44,612
- Yeah, but the problem is
Mackie is as organized as hell.

379
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,527
He's got an actual network
to move that carfentanil

380
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,355
smooth and fast as he cuts it.

381
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,183
- All right,
so let's get ahead of him.

382
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,576
Driver of the carfentanil,
he got an in with Mackie?

383
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,622
- Nah, kid's a nobody.

384
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:56,450
He just picks up cars,
drops off cars.

385
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:57,886
No contact with the boss.

386
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,584
- Boss,
we might have a problem here.

387
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,064
I ran Mackie through Narcotics;

388
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,110
they've got the G Parks up
on a title three.

389
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:05,937
They don't got much
from Mackie on the wire,

390
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:08,070
but they were able to get
a half-dozen covert cams

391
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,029
on his corners.

392
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:16,426
- When's this from?
- Two days ago.

393
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,993
- All right, get up on Mackie.

394
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,561
I want you to flood his turf
with undercover buys.

395
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:22,128
Any of that carfentanil drops,

396
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:25,000
we clear every single corner
he's got.

397
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,872
Send me that footage.
- Got it.

398
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,148
- Man, who do you think I am?

399
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,498
- What's wrong with you?

400
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,716
- You think I'm
one of your boys,

401
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,805
you can just
yank me around?

402
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:49,285
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

403
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,461
- No?

404
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:52,897
You trying to tell me

405
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:55,465
you don't know where
Book was getting his drugs?

406
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,122
Hmm?

407
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,691
- The way I remember it,
you asked me a direct question

408
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,388
and I gave you
a direct answer.

409
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:08,130
It's not my job to trace
where he's getting his product,

410
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,436
that's yours.

411
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,484
- You don't want to play
with me, Darius.

412
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,313
You understand?

413
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:20,708
'Cause I don't play.

414
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:26,540
Turn around.

415
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,150
Turn around.

416
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,196
Give me your hands.

417
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:32,328
You're under arrest.

418
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:40,293
.

419
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:53,175
- I left out Mackie
because we do business.

420
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:56,352
Lease our border corners
when product's low.

421
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:01,444
Made sense to give you Book;
he was a problem.

422
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:04,621
Made no business sense
to give you Mackie.

423
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:07,972
Not when I can
handle him myself.

424
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:10,627
- Okay.

425
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:13,021
Well, that all may
or may not be true...

426
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,981
But we're here now.

427
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,722
I need Mackie.

428
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:20,942
You've got to give him to me.

429
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:22,465
- No.

430
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,120
- Darius,

431
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,209
I'm not asking.

432
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:33,476
- I do that, I'm dead.

433
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:38,220
Let me worry about that.

434
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:42,050
I'll find a way to make sure
we all stay upright.

435
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,008
That's my job.

436
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:10,600
You know...

437
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,350
At some point, you and I,
we're gonna have to start

438
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:22,873
trusting each other
a little bit.

439
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,879
Or there's nothing in this
for either of us.

440
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:37,627
- This is a pinhole camera.
It's your COH.

441
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,368
It means we'll have eyes
and ears on you at all times

442
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,848
even when you can't see us.

443
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,371
- Which is gonna be most of it.

444
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:45,069
Voight wants to play this safe,
so no ghost inside

445
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:46,723
and no surveillance
for a two-block radius.

446
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,247
- Okay.

447
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,118
Where are the cops
who worked my case?

448
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:53,208
Uh, Nina or Vanessa
and Kevin?

449
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,602
- Working.

450
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,692
It's a tactic.
You're a new CI.

451
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:02,565
Voight wants to keep things
calm so you're not...

452
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:04,785
distracted.

453
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,134
- Um, all right.

454
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,267
She's gonna get
the video feed up and running,

455
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,746
and I'm gonna check
your levels, all right?

456
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,922
So let me just speak
at normal volume...

457
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,055
- What are you doing?

458
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:21,454
What the hell are you doing?
- I've been hitting the courts,

459
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:22,977
couple of crash pads out there.
- What?

460
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,414
- It's sounding like Book
was gunning for a regent there.

461
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,547
Prick's name is Mackie.
- Cam, have you lost your mind?

462
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,027
- I can get an intro.
- Stop, stop!

463
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,551
The first rule of being a CI

464
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,117
is to not walk into
a damn police station.

465
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,118
- Whoa, hey, relax.

466
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,598
- You were just seen.

467
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:37,731
Jesus, I don't even know
how you got inside.

468
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:40,168
- No, you don't got
to do me like that.

469
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:41,691
Don't treat me like
you gotta keep me in line.

470
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:43,650
I ain't working off a case.
I know what I'm doing.

471
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:44,999
I know people here.

472
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:46,740
I made it look like I just
got popped from holding.

473
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:48,350
- Cam, you might have
just burned yourself.

474
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:50,613
- I didn't
- I can't use you.

475
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:54,443
- Are you kidding?
- I don't have a choice.

476
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,445
You have to leave town
and lay low for a while.

477
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:58,360
- Look, I'm not burned.
- It's done.

478
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,406
- You can't just decide that.

479
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:03,278
It's my job.
It's what I got.

480
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,802
If I'm not reliable,
I don't get jobs no more.

481
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:07,630
You can't pull me
before we're paid out.

482
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,284
- Yes, I can.

483
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,460
It's my job to pull you.

484
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,244
I'll pay you for the drugs
we seized,

485
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:15,029
but then you have
to leave town.

486
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:16,247
We're done.

487
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,392
We're up.

488
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,440
- Sarge,
Darius has some company here.

489
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,659
Male, black, 30s,
unidentified.

490
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:39,401
- It's got to be
Darius' enforcer, security.

491
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,794
- You want us to run
an intercept?

492
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,056
Kev's, like,
three blocks down.

493
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,188
He can do a drive by.
- No, let it play.

494
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,150
- We need to talk.

495
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,983
- All right, let's go talk.

496
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:59,029
- No, no, no.
We could talk right here.

497
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,423
Your new product is still
in my neighborhood.

498
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:04,557
Washington Courts, four ODs.

499
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,515
- I ain't be dealing that.

500
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,518
It's your product.

501
00:23:09,562 --> 00:23:12,434
You let your product
get ripped.

502
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,916
You let that product run
into my neighborhood.

503
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,134
You getting it, Mackie?

504
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:20,790
Your product, your problem.

505
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,575
- Yeah, we already on it,
homie.

506
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:24,577
- Oh, no, homie.

507
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,100
See, the solution is gonna be

508
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:29,930
that I buy the rest
of your carfentanil supply.

509
00:23:30,974 --> 00:23:32,454
- The hell you are.

510
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,805
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

511
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:38,068
- What the hell?
- Are we moving, Sarge?

512
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:40,244
- We're trusting Darius.
Hold.

513
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,246
- You sure you wanna do that?

514
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:05,748
- Do you know why
you have corners, Mackie?

515
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:10,927
Because I let you.

516
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,886
I gave them.

517
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,453
I will take them.

518
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:20,850
So the rest
of your carfentanil.

519
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm gonna give you
a good price.

520
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:24,811
You won't lose money.

521
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,294
You guys free tomorrow?

522
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:33,123
Hmm?

523
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,517
You guys?

524
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,868
Mackie?

525
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:42,481
- Yeah.

526
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,744
Noon, lot off 73rd.

527
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,267
- My man.

528
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,797
- We're in.

529
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:56,625
- This guy might have
more power than we thought.

530
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:58,584
"Because I let you"?
He sounded like Voight.

531
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,676
- You've got to be kidding me.

532
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:05,852
- I thought you kicked him.
- I did.

533
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,382
- I know, I know.

534
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:15,514
Relax, you're gonna be happy.

535
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:16,863
- I wasn't playing
with you, man.

536
00:25:16,906 --> 00:25:19,343
- I got something good, girl.
Something real good.

537
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:21,041
Your new CI Darius

538
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,526
5021 Henry, 10-1, 10-1.

539
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,788
Shots fired at the police.

540
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,311
I got a civilian down

541
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,661
I'm pinned at 1310 West Racine.

542
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:35,142
I'm a plainclothes officer.
I need backup.

543
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:36,839
- Units in 21
and units on the citywide,

544
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:38,580
we have a 10-1 being called.

545
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:40,016
1310 Racine.

546
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,801
Plainclothes officer
taking fire.

547
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:44,107
Everyone stay off the air
and start heading that way.

548
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:47,546
- 5021 Henry, shots are coming
from the upper levels.

549
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,069
I believe it's one shooter.

550
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:50,679
How far out is my backup?

551
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,594
- Rolling your way.
A minute out.

552
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,030
- Copy that.

553
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:55,336
I'm going around back
of the building, going dark.

554
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:57,033
- Copy.

555
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:17,445
I'm the police!
Gun!

556
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,360
- You good?
You cleared the building?

557
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,928
- No, you clear it.

558
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:24,887
Back up.
Hey, back up!

559
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:25,714
Get back!

560
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:26,933
- Back up.
Back up.

561
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:28,064
Back up, guys.

562
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:50,565
.

563
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,436
- Hey.

564
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,787
- Hey.

565
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,005
Patrol transported
the shooter in?

566
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:57,224
- Yeah, I just logged him in.

567
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:58,617
He's in Intelligence.

568
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,184
Voight and Halstead
are having a run at him.

569
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:03,012
Uh, his name is AJ Flores.

570
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,971
Multiple priors,
affiliated with

571
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:07,538
hey, Hailey.
Hailey?

572
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:08,888
Take a second.

573
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:11,064
- To what?
Calm down?

574
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,240
- To read the file.

575
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:14,676
- I don't need to read
the file.

576
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,982
I know what just happened.

577
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:20,769
He killed my CI right
in front of me, Trudy.

578
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:23,859
That's what just happened.

579
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:29,212
- Cameron was a snitch,
deserved to die.

580
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,692
So I followed him
and then I shot him.

581
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:33,216
- You can keep saying that.

582
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,349
It's still not gonna be
the news you think it is.

583
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,612
- We already got you on that,
AJ.

584
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:41,834
- Y'all don't need
any more police.

585
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,183
I shot him.

586
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:45,533
Cameron was a snitch,
deserved to die.

587
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:47,274
So I followed him
and then I shot him.

588
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:49,885
- How'd you know
he was a snitch?

589
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:52,061
How?

590
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:54,150
Someone told you.
Who?

591
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,590
Was it this guy?

592
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,122
Darius Walker told you
he was a snitch

593
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:11,080
and he ordered the hit,
didn't he?

594
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:14,431
- Cameron was a snitch,
deserved to die...

595
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,216
- I don't want
your rehearsed garbage.

596
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,696
Did he order the hit?

597
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,133
- Cameron was a snitch,
deserved to die.

598
00:28:20,176 --> 00:28:22,657
So I followed him
and then I shot him.

599
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,180
- Okay, I'll give you a deal.

600
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:25,747
- Cameron was a snitch...
- What do you want?

601
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,488
Come on, we'll put it
in writing right now.

602
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:28,707
- Hailey.

603
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,057
- So then I followed him
and then I shot him.

604
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:34,582
I'd like
my public defender now.

605
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,891
I can sign whatever
you want me to sign,

606
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:40,588
but I said what I'm gonna say.

607
00:28:45,462 --> 00:28:48,248
- The kid's been in lockup
one too many times.

608
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:49,640
He's not gonna say
more than he wants.

609
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:52,861
- Then we bring Darius in
and arrest him now.

610
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,428
He saw Cameron.

611
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:56,604
He knew Cameron
could ID him as a CI

612
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,301
and he had him killed.

613
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:04,003
All right.

614
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:05,787
What do we got on him?

615
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,181
- Well, we ran the shooter's
phone against Darius',

616
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,139
and absolutely no contact.

617
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:13,752
CHRIS system, social media,
jail logs, last knowns.

618
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,318
There's no connection
to Darius at all.

619
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:17,146
- AJ runs with
the Latin Players,

620
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,974
Darius with
the Southside Hustlers.

621
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:20,193
I mean, they're worlds apart.

622
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:21,672
- They could've met in person.

623
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,152
- We had eyes on Darius
all day

624
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:24,588
except for about an hour
and a half.

625
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:25,851
- Ballistics?

626
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,591
- It does link up
to two unsolved shootings,

627
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:29,202
but they're both hooked up
to Latin Players.

628
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:30,681
No connect to Darius.

629
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:32,683
- But we do have the shooter
connected to Cameron.

630
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:34,555
I mean, Cameron's worked him
on a case before.

631
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,818
- Yeah, but did Cameron
ever work Darius?

632
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,168
- No, and if he found out
who Cameron was

633
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:40,691
after seeing him
in the roll up,

634
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,084
we can't prove it.

635
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,651
- Hailey,

636
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:46,567
chances are this shooting's
got nothing to do with Darius.

637
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,526
- All this proves is
that Darius is smart.

638
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,528
Cameron figured out
who Darius was in three hours.

639
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:53,182
There's no way that Darius
didn't figure out

640
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,489
who Cameron was
in less than that.

641
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:58,100
We need to bring Darius in,
we hold him for 48,

642
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,275
and we press him.

643
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,842
- We have this buy set
with Darius.

644
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,888
- Who the hell cares?

645
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:04,150
We're still gonna use him

646
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:05,804
even though he might've
just offed a CI?

647
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,766
We're still gonna use him?

648
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,812
- Cameron was a pro CI.

649
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,162
He worked hundreds of cases.

650
00:30:16,205 --> 00:30:18,251
This might not have been
the one that caught him.

651
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:21,863
- Sarge, if we use him,
we might be losing evidence.

652
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:25,301
- If we don't use him,
we will lose the carfentanil.

653
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:28,261
And we've got to go
with what we got now.

654
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:31,003
We'll deal with the rest
when we're done.

655
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:32,700
Okay?

656
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:36,573
Now this buy, it balances
on a razor's edge

657
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:39,620
'cause we've got to bust Mackie
without burning Darius.

658
00:30:51,632 --> 00:30:53,286
- All right, we've got eyes
on Darius and Mackie

659
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:56,202
from the north end.

660
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:58,813
- All right, we're up.

661
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,772
Everyone keeps tight
and keeps back

662
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:04,340
until you get the word
"go" from me.

663
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,255
Nice and easy here.

664
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,257
We let Darius play this one.

665
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,348
- Right on time.

666
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:27,320
- It'd be real easy to move on
them both right now.

667
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:29,496
Burn Darius,
can't use him anymore.

668
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,193
He'd be booked,
do his original time.

669
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:33,456
- Yeah, for drugs.

670
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,068
- 30 years is 30 years.

671
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,129
- All right,
we got eyes on the drugs.

672
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:55,826
Half dozen half-keys.

673
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,741
- Copy that.
Nobody move.

674
00:31:57,785 --> 00:32:00,179
We wait for Darius
to make his play.

675
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,007
We wait until "go."

676
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:05,010
- We're trusting
we're protecting a killer.

677
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:08,317
- Hailey,
I'd follow you anywhere.

678
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:11,712
But I know right now you would
tell me to trust Voight.

679
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,896
- The hell is he doing?
Why is he not moving?

680
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,554
Come on, man.

681
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:42,873
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.

682
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,150
What is this?

683
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,891
- What?

684
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:03,198
Why do you have a tracker
on your car?

685
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:08,029
Are you...

686
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,726
are you playing me?

687
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,380
Mackie, are you working
with the police?

688
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,121
- What the hell
you talking about, man?

689
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:15,558
- Why do you have a bug
on your car?

690
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:17,212
- Itit ain't bugged.
Man, I didn't

691
00:33:17,256 --> 00:33:18,561
- It is.

692
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:21,477
There's a tracker on your car.

693
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:23,914
There's a wire on you.
- I ain't no snitch, man!

694
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,612
- Well, if you're not,
they're working you.

695
00:33:25,655 --> 00:33:27,309
- That's not possible, dawg!

696
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:28,658
- Hey, if they got
your car bugged,

697
00:33:28,702 --> 00:33:30,399
it means they got you bugged.

698
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,793
Mackie,
we're about to get jammed.

699
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:33,881
So move.

700
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:35,274
- But there's nobody here
though, man.

701
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:36,971
- Mackie, get in your car
and move!

702
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,242
- Chicago PD!

703
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:48,591
- Chicago PD!
Don't move!

704
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:50,767
Stay right where you are.
- Hands up right now!

705
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,596
Put your hands up!
Put 'em up!

706
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,081
Put your hands on the car!

707
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,083
- Tell me someone's got eyes
on that second vehicle.

708
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,085
- Negative.
Car's in the wind.

709
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:06,348
I repeat, we do not have eyes.

710
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:08,350
Calling it over
to citywide now.

711
00:34:14,052 --> 01:08:28,746
.

712
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:17,403
- There was another car there,
Mackie.

713
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:20,188
Okay, who was it?

714
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:22,147
- We got all night.

715
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,976
- Who were you selling to?

716
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,981
- By the time you come
stumbling out the joint,

717
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,548
the whole game
will be dried up.

718
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:34,376
You'll be an old ass man,
Mackie.

719
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,031
- All your corner boys dead
or gunning for somebody else.

720
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,120
- You think the streets are
still gonna have love for you?

721
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:41,949
- Unless you wanna lower
your sentence; talk to us.

722
00:34:41,992 --> 00:34:43,603
Tell us who
you were selling to.

723
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:45,039
We can help you out.

724
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,345
- Help.

725
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:48,521
Help is as easy as
a 99 confidential agreement.

726
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:49,739
All you got to do is cooperate.

727
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,045
- Ask me one more time.
- Sit down!

728
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,481
- I ain't no bitch-ass snitch,
man!

729
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,830
Hey, I don't work
for the police, man!

730
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,136
- Shut up, man!

731
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:58,792
- I ain't no bitch-ass snitch!
- Shut up!

732
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:00,924
- Well, I'd say that's a win.

733
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,578
That guy has no idea
we played him.

734
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:09,063
Hailey?

735
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,674
Cameron forgot
which way was up.

736
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,339
- Well, I think we are good.

737
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:28,822
Mackie definitely bought it.
You weren't made.

738
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:30,954
- Okay.

739
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:34,349
- We aren't done yet.

740
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:38,136
I'm gonna ask you
a direct question.

741
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,746
You need to give me
a direct answer.

742
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:46,492
Did you order the hit
on Cameron Balow?

743
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:53,107
I'm not an 18-year-old
corner boy

744
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,328
you popped with a dime bag.
- I know.

745
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:01,028
- We've both been on
the streets a long time.

746
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:03,422
Maybe different ends,
but street's the same.

747
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:09,210
We both know that every time
you stand across from a CI,

748
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:10,603
you lie.

749
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,039
You can't protect them.

750
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:16,652
Nine times out of ten,
the house wins,

751
00:36:16,696 --> 00:36:20,090
and the person
in my seat is dead.

752
00:36:21,918 --> 00:36:25,357
I know that, you know that.

753
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,361
Cameron damn well knew that.

754
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,302
- Anything new?
- No.

755
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:59,086
No, we're at the same place
we were.

756
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,218
There's no evidence.

757
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:04,222
- Sarge, what's your call
on Darius?

758
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,136
- I wanna keep him in play.
He's valuable.

759
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:11,141
He probably saved us
hundreds of ODs, right?

760
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:14,014
Look, the rest is simple.

761
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,409
It's one murder we never make.

762
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:21,761
He may not even be involved.

763
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:23,980
- There's no way
you believe that.

764
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:35,296
My office?

765
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,961
Sit down.

766
00:37:48,004 --> 00:37:50,311
- I don't care
if we can't make the case.

767
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:52,400
You and I both know
he was involved.

768
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,315
You can't trust him.

769
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:55,838
- I don't.

770
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:58,798
- There's a thousand things
that we don't know about him.

771
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:00,147
- I'm sure that's true.

772
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,367
- He should be held
accountable.

773
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,543
- Cameron walked into
a police station.

774
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:06,588
He knew he could be made.

775
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,242
Then he went directly out
on the streets

776
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,983
- Look, no, no.
I'm not defending him.

777
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,811
I'm not saying
he was a good guy,

778
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:13,508
a smart guy,
a right guy.

779
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:16,337
But he was my guy.

780
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,513
He was my CI.

781
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:21,211
I put him out there.

782
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:23,344
He was mine.

783
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:26,956
- Why don't you tell me
what you want?

784
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,523
I mean, right now.

785
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,352
You want me to yell at you?

786
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:33,354
Or do you want me
to make you feel better?

787
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,443
Hmm?

788
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,663
- Hailey.

789
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:44,191
You're a good cop.

790
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,933
So you know I made
the right decision tonight.

791
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:57,378
He was yours,
and his death is yours.

792
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,211
Listen, never once have
we made a deal with an angel,

793
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:07,519
someone we can trust.

794
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:08,955
It's not how CIs work.

795
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:13,829
I shouldn't have
to explain that to you.

796
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,443
It's a necessary part
of the job.

797
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:19,966
I mean, it's...

798
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:27,495
We keep one foot in a world
we don't belong in,

799
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:32,500
and we ask our CIs
to do the exact same thing.

800
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:39,159
Only...

801
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,900
you're the cop.

802
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:42,858
Cameron was a snitch.

803
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:49,430
So I'm sure his death is

804
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:52,477
the cost of the game,
but...

805
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,656
You're the one who
has the carry it.

806
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:06,012
That is on you.

807
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,692
- How do I do that?

808
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:38,087
How do I carry it?

809
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,968
I still have no idea.
