1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,190
喂  伴郎
Hey, best man.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,900
《摩登家庭》前情提要

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,190
是啊  我也觉得你应该叫我"伴人"
Yeah, I think I might go with "Best person."

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,430
又是老妈的事吗  我说过了  我没事
Is this about mom again? I told you, I'm fine.

5
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,780
我只是有点同情你
I was just a little sad for you.

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,880
老妈爽约了
Mom's a no-show,

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,960
你和老爸又几乎不说话
and you and dad are hardly even speaking.

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,980
我要抛弃你
I'm leaving you!

9
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,130
但我要先抛弃你
Not if I leave you first!

10
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,630
你干了什么
What did you do?!

11
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,900
注意  各位请注意
Attention! Attention, please!

12
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,860
大火已经漫过高速了
The fire has jumped the freeway.

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,550
等等  等等等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

14
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,790
如果你们要疏散整个区域
If you're evacuating the whole area,

15
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,350
能不能最后疏散我们
can't you just do us last?

16
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
恐怕你们还没意识到
I don't think you realize

17
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,290
你们离实际火源有多近
how close you are to actual flames.

18
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,770
你好  我是胡娇・萨茨曼
Hello. Pepper Saltzman.

19
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,820

我收藏了你们所有的年历
Have all your calendars.

21
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,060
我们已经等了10年
We've waited 10 years.

22
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,630
能给我们一个小时吗
Can we please have an hour?

23
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,040
只能给你们30分钟
I can give you 30 minutes.

24
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,700
那样就够了
We can make that work!

25
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,800
婚礼稍微简化  继续进行
The wedding will go on just in a slightly pared-down version.

26
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,760
克莱尔  你到前面去
Claire, you're up front.

27
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,830
花童  撒花去
Flower girl, strewing.

28
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,160
新郎们  跟我来
Grooms, come with me.

29
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,120
他们看起来好帅啊
"Ooh! Ahh! They look so handsome!"

30
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,780
四重唱  四重唱  四重唱
Quartet, quartet, quartet!

31
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,500
萨尔该你了  五行打油诗就别念了
And cue Sal. Start after your limerick.

32
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,000
天呐  不
Oh, God, no!

33
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,020
我们都得牺牲一些  亲爱的
Ugh! We're all making sacrifices, dear.

34
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,150
我那还有一车的帝王蝶
I have a Prius full of monarch butterflies

35
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,320
看来是要跟我回家了
who are apparently coming home with me.

36
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,040
不是吧
Aah! No!

37
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,930
她羊水破了
Her water broke!

38
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,880
不  没有破  我才刚刚怀孕
No! No, it did not! I am barely pregnant!

39
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,070
感谢各位莅临这个大喜的日子
Thank you all for being here on this joyous occasion.

40
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,340
曾有一个基佬名叫塔克
There once was a homo named Tucker --

41
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,090
萨尔  快停下  不行  你要分娩了
Sal, stop. No, you're going into labor!

42
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,920
行行好  快停下吧
Also, just stop!

43
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,370
但我们才在一起四个月啊
But we've only been together four months.

44
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,050
我太爱你了
I just love you so much,

45
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,790
迫不及待想要生出你的孩子
I can't wait to have your baby.

46
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,100
天呐  孩子把一切都毁了
God! Kids ruin everything!

47
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,060
是啊  没错
Yeah, they sure do.

48
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,010
我带你去医院  生下我们的奇迹宝宝吧
Let's get you to the hospital and have our miracle baby.

49
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,820
好
Okay.

50
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,030
只是要告知你一下
Just so you know,

51
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,150
有时这么早产的孩子
sometimes when babies come this early...

52
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,230
生出来是黑皮肤的
...they're black.

53
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,740
彻底灾难了
Okay, this is a disaster!

54
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,290
没人为我们证婚了
We have no one to marry us!

55
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,530
亲爱的人们  这确实是个问题
Dearly beloved, that is a problem.

56
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,480
是啊
Yep.

好牧师菲利普・汉弗莱・邓菲

60
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,850
去年一整年  我都在向米奇和小卡暗示
Over the last year, I've dropped a few subtle hints

61
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,900
我也可以当婚礼主持
to Mitch and Cam that I was available.

62
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,070
你们决定让谁做主婚人了吗
Hey, have you guys decided who's gonna officiate your wedding?

63
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,430
我在网上获得牧师资格了
'cause I got ordained online.

64
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,280
天呐  那儿有小袋鼠
Oh, my God. A wallaby!

65
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,240
天呐
Oh, my gosh!

66
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,390
未完待续
To be continued!

67
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,350
菲尔  你真是大救星  谢谢你
Phil, you're a lifesaver. Thank you.

68
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,040
不必感谢
No thanks necessary.

69
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,190
卡梅隆  为你证婚[娶你]
Cameron, marrying you would

70
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:02,230
让我成了世上最幸福的男人
make me the happiest man on earth.

71
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,390
各位  请注意
Everyone, attention, please!

72
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,620
消防队长刚通知我
I've been informed by the fire chief

73
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,370
我们得马上撤离
we need to leave immediately!

74
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,170
-风向变了  -什么
- The winds have shifted! - What?

75
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,660
但我们有30分钟的啊
But w-we have 30 minutes!

76
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,080
一个婚庆策划同事通知我
A fellow wedding facilitator has informed me

77
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,880
有个美丽的场地刚刚空出来了
a beautiful space just became available.

78
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,710
大家都去摆渡车那里
To the shuttles!

79
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,770
但我们完全不了解那地方的情况
But we don't know a thing about this place.

80
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,830
我的错
Oh, my mistake.

81
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,800
我们快速了解一下
Let's go over it.

82
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,210
那是个古雅充满田园风情的地方
It's a quaint, rustic spot,

83
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,410
但其主要卖点是
though its chief selling point

84
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,150
那里不会变成烧窖
is it's not about to become a kiln!

小卡  把大家从停车场
Cam, where are the shuttles

98
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,730
载到山上的摆渡车都哪儿去了
that brought everyone up from the parking lot?

99
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,700
显然是有别人也订了
Apparently they were double booked.

100
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,570
胡娇已经尽力了
This is the best Pepper could do.

101
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,310
我们就让大家这样去婚礼会场吗
This is how we're getting everyone to the wedding?

102
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,240
我们有一半的来宾是基佬
Half our guests are gay.

103
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,140
他们终于可以有一次
We're finally giving them

不受欺负的校车回忆了
a good memory on a school bus.

105
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,410
那边没有完全缝好
That doesn't look completely sewn on.

106
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,680
你最好找个东西遮一下
You might want to get something to cover that.

107
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,880
好主意
Oh, good idea.

108
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,000
谢谢
Thank you.

109
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,550
你跟莫尔说了什么让他想抛弃巴布
What did you say to Merle that make him want to leave Barb?

110
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,350
我不知道啊
I have no idea!

111
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,820
我们闲聊而已
We were just shooting the breeze --

112
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,040
聊婚礼  迪迪
Wedding day, DeDe,

113
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,750
还有娶了你我有多幸福
how happy I am now that I'm with you.

114
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,570
你为什么要说那些
Why would you say something like that?

115
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,500
你这样可伤透了某人的心
Now you're breaking somebody's heart.

116
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,360
我没想伤害巴布
I didn't mean for her to get hurt.

117
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,050
不是巴布  是莫尔  当他意识到
Not her, him when he realizes

118
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,500
不是每个人的第二任妻子都能有这种身材
that not every second wife looks like this.

119
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,020
谢谢你把外套借给我  杰
Thank you for lending me your jacket, Jay.

120
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,260
知道这世上还有绅士  我很欣慰
It's good to know there are still gentlemen in the world.

121
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,340
是你啊  巴布
Oh, it's you, Barb.

122
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,750
我的美好未来在前方闪耀
I didn't see you there on account of

123
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,060
我都没注意到你
my bright future.

124
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,660
谢谢你  歌洛莉亚
Thank you, Gloria.

125
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,350
勇敢抵抗那个老混蛋[山羊]
Standing up to that old goat

126
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,940
是我做过最棒的事
was best thing I ever did.

127
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,960
那是怎么回事
What's all that about?

128
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,100
不不  是她跟我讲的一个山羊的故事
No, no. The thing is that she told me a story about a goat

129
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,610
山羊很老了  后来这只山羊
and it's very old and then the goat --

130
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,300
别糊弄我
Oh, don't give me that.

131
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,070
我让她勇敢表达自己
I told her to express herself.

132
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,340
我相信一段和谐的婚姻中
I believe that in a good marriage,

133
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:47,840
女人能够表...
a woman can ex--

134
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
好吧  无所谓  我来解决
Fine. Whatever. I'll undo it.

135
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:55,190
我们不能让小卡知道他父母的情况
We can't let Cam know what the situation with his parents is.

136
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,920
他非常敏感的
He's very delicate.

137
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,230
难以相信  我竟然
I can't believe I'm involved

138
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,140
又一次参与了破坏他人婚姻的事
in breaking up yet another marriage.

139
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,030
什么
What?

140
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,180
你还好吗
Hey, hey. How you holding up?

141
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,370
不是很好
Uh, I've had better days.

142
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,190
但你跟我  我们没事吧  
But you and me -- we're cool, right?

143
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,040
有些事情我们可能需要谈一谈
We probably have some things that we should talk about,

144
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,800
但是留在压力没这么大的日子谈吧
but maybe we save it for a less-stressful day.

145
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,590
顺便说一句  这不是你的错
This is not your fault, by the way.

146
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,840
火是不可抗力
the fire was an act of God.

147
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,840
不是说上帝搞了个火球
Not that God sent a fireball down

148
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,360
不让男人和男人结婚  但是...
to keep a couple guys from getting married, but, uh...

149
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,510
我表达得不太好
I didn't say that right.

150
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,410
今天所有的一切都绝不可能
There's no way that this -- any of this --

151
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,730
是上帝的安排
is part of God's plan.

152
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,900
留到敬酒时再说吧  老爸
Save something for the toast, dad.

153
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,980
该死
Damn it.

154
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,250
你想把这个放在哪里
Where do you want this?

155
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,270
五号巴士  你的声音怎么了
Bus five. What's wrong with your voice?

156
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,870
我们三个自驾游去了
The three of us just took a road trip.

157
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,000
去德州边境的路上
We sang Broadway tunes

158
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,690
我们一直在唱百老汇的歌
all the way to the Texas border.

159
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,040
从德州另一面去佛罗里达的路上也是
And then from the other side of Texas to Florida.

160
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,070
所以你是牧师吗
Hey, so you're, like, the minister?

161
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,560
差不多吧  萨尔走后
Kinda. When they lost Sal,

162
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,050
事情变得不费脑筋[没脑子]
the situation was a no-brainer,

163
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,340
所以他们想到了我
which made them think of me.

164
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
要证婚不是要记住很多东西吗
Isn't there a lot you have to remember to marry people?

165
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,600
没有啦  都是一样的词儿
Not really. They all follow the same basic pattern.

166
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,130
我们今天齐聚一堂  参加两位新人的
"We're gathered here today to join these two

167
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,060
神圣婚礼
"in holy matrimony.

168
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,350
你愿意让他做你的合法配偶吗
Do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse?"

169
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,250
第一个人说
And the first person says --

170
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,440
-我愿意  -对
- I do? - Right.

171
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,730
然后我问第二个人
Then I ask the second person,

172
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,400
你愿意让他做你的合法配偶吗
"Do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse?"

173
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,760
-你们知道这一套吧  -对[我愿意]
- You know the drill, right? - I do.

174
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,040
然后我说  根据加利福利亚州
Then I say, "By the powers vested in me

175
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
赋予我的权力
by the state of California,

176
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,170
我宣布你们结为合法配偶
I now pronounce you legally wed."

177
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,530
噼里啪啦砰  这婚就结成了
Bingo, bango, bongo, you're married.

178
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,450
太棒了
Awesome.

179
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,840
真的很棒
Really awesome.

180
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,450
巴布  我理解你现在的经历
Look, Barb, I know what you're going through.

181
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,210
你和莫尔的婚姻走到了十字路口
You and Merle are at a crossroads in your marriage.

182
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,850
感觉像是世界末日
It feels like the end of the world,

183
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,190
但是不久后  你会觉得这是...
but in time, you'll see it more as a --

184
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,460
对啊
Right.

185
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,380
就像打嗝一样的小插曲  谁都会经历
A little hiccup that we all go through.

186
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,160
我的建议是  什么都别做
My advice -- don't do anything.

187
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,390
花点时间  喘口气
Just take some time and breathe.

188
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,860
从鼻子里呼气比较好
Maybe through your nose.

189
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,670
你在我的口袋里找到了什么吗
Did you happen to find anything in one of my pockets?

190
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,620
你这样问真奇怪[酒瓶]
Funny you should "Flask."

191
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,570
这个给我吧
Maybe I'll just take that.

192
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,620
不好意思
Excuse me.

193
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,690
现在轻多了  对吧
Well, it's much lighter now, isn't it?

194
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:50,630
是啊
Yeah.

195
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,980
真奇怪
Okay, this is weird.

196
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,000
我觉得这就是我去学校路上时
I think this is the same seat I used to nervously scratch at

197
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,000
紧张抓挠的座椅
on my way to school.

198
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,540
真可怜
Oh, poor thing.

199
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,430
是啊
Yeah.

200
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,120
我那时就觉得要做到完美好有压力
Even then I felt such pressure to be perfect.

201
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,330
安迪的航班又延误了
Andy's flight is delayed again.

202
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,340
好吧  很接近了
Okay. That was close.

203
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,710
我们差点就在人类水平上有交流了
We almost connected on a human level.

204
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,860
他在做蠢事
He's doing the dumbest thing.

205
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,050
他女朋友和他分手了
His girlfriend broke up with him,

206
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,200
他要飞过去赢回她的心
and he's flying out to win her back.

207
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,510
听起来好浪漫
That sounds so romantic.

208
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,630
太软弱了
It's so weak.

209
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,950
这女生一发脾气  他就跑过去
This girl throws a fit, he goes running.

210
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,360
如果他们复合了  她就大权在握了
If they get back together, she has all the power.

211
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,330
天啊  你喜欢他
Oh, my god. You like him.

212
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,430
不  我才没有  什么啊
No, I don't. What?

213
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,460
太搞笑了
This is so hilarious.

214
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,680
他完全不是你喜欢的类型
He's totally not your type.

215
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,610
闭嘴
Shut up.

216
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,730
拜托  你一直想着他  查看他的情况
Please. You can't stop thinking about him, you're checking on him.

217
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,140
他甚至不像个真人
He's not even like a real person.

218
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,400
他就像个提线木偶
He's like a muppet.

219
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,120
我都不明白萨尔写的一些话
I don't even get some of Sal's remarks here.

220
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,620
婚姻就像是高速公路
"Marriage is like a freeway --

221
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,900
很凌乱  但如果你们交流  就很值得
Messy, but if you communicate, it's so worth it."

222
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,340
亲  那不是"高速公路"[threeway: 三人式]
Honey, that does not say "Freeway."

223
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,670
我不能用这个
I can't use any of this,

224
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,660
但我不想让这场婚礼很普通
but I don't want the whole ceremony to be generic.

225
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,480
应该要有些魔力
There needs to be some magic in it.

226
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
你可以读一首诗或者
Well, you can read a poem or maybe --

227
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,440
等等  往回倒
Hold on. Back up.

228
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,210
我喜欢你的上一个主意  变魔术
I like your last idea -- a magic trick.

229
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,200
我没有提议要变魔术
I did not suggest a magic trick.

230
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,950
毕竟  有什么比魔术
After all, what's better than magic

231
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,210
更能象征婚姻的美好呢
to symbolize the wonder of marriage?!

232
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,320
抱歉  我在和你说话呢
Excuse me. I'm talking to you.

233
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,000
好吧
Yeah, yeah.

234
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,310
在商店里你穿起来还不错
They looked good on you in the store,

235
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,640
但现在你不确定了
but now you're not sure.

236
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,450
那是十分钟前的话题
That was the topic 10 minutes ago.

237
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,280
也许我把体育版贴到我头上
Well, maybe if I stapled the sports page to my head,

238
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,240
你就会注意到我了
you'd pay attention.

239
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,850
只要能盖住你的嘴
As long as it covered your mouth.

240
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,190
-什么  -没事
- What? - Nothing.

241
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,860
我们什么时候才能到啊
Ugh, when are we going to be there?

242
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,790
快了  亲爱的  很快了
Soon, honey. Very soon.

243
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,150
来  笑一个
Come on. Give us a smile.

244
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,270
记住  这是你爸爸们生命中
Remember, this is the happiest day

245
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,920
最快乐的一天
of your dads' lives.

246
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,510
蝴蝶在吃我
The butterflies are eating me!

247
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,630
谁要你碰那个盒子的
Well, who told you to jostle the crate?!

248
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,180
一只飞进了我嘴里
Oh, blah. One got in my mouth.

249
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,910
真是一群小孩
What a bunch of babies.

250
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,610
胡娇说这里很棒  希望我们会喜欢
Pepper said it was nice. I hope we like it.

251
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,140
小卡  不管帘子那边是什么样
Cam, Cam, listen, whatever's on the other side of this curtain,

252
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,320
我们都不能失望
we cannot be disappointed.

253
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:38,910
你说得对
You're right.

254
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,640
今天的重点不是花朵或其他肤浅的事
Today is not about flowers or superficial things.

255
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,540
对  好吧
Right. Okay.

256
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,380
-谢天谢地  -好漂亮  我害怕死了
- Oh, thank god. - It's pretty. I was so scared!

257
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,790
我超喜欢  我都要哭了
Oh, I love it, I love it. I could cry!

258
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,690
别哭了  会把脸上打的修容粉毁掉的
Oh, don't cry. You'll streak your bronzer.

259
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,310
大家请就坐
Everyone, please take your seats!

260
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,360
我们五分钟[西语]后开始
We'll be starting in cinco minutes,

261
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,700
也就是最多十分钟
10 at the most.

262
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,830
你有没有发现罗纳多的
Do you ever notice with Ronaldo

263
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,860
语言障碍时不时会发作是吗
how his language barrier sort of fluctuates?

264
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,600
这地方是怎么订到的
How is this place even available?

265
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,070
可怕的故事
Oh, dreadful story.

266
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,570
新娘跑了  新郎闹自杀  世仇家族
Runaway bride, suicidal groom, feuding families.

267
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,930
相比之下我们的小问题真是不值一提
It really puts our mundane problems in perspective.

268
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,260
灯光不能调暗
Oh, we can't dim the lights.

269
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,150
那就打碎几盏
Then break some.

270
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,790
他们已没有年轻人那么无敌的皮肤了
These are not young men!

271
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,440
你们去梳洗打扮一下吧
Why don't you two go freshen up?

272
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,170
等等
Wait.

273
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,940
为什么四重奏只来了一半
Why am I seeing only half a quartet?

274
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,480
埃德和吉姆是志愿消防员
Ed and jim are volunteer firemen.

275
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,600
可不是嘛
Of course they are.

276
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,330
你们尽量找面镜子对着弹吧
Try to play in front of a mirror.

277
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,520
-幸运之吻  - 好吧  好吧

279

280
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,250
幸好我们已经出了火灾区
Oh, oh, good thing we're out of the fire zone.

281
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,830
要知道你爸爸给了我个婚礼小帮手
Well, you know your dad gave me a little wedding helper.

282
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,450
我不知道我外套里面还有一个
I didn't know the jacket still had a --

283
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,360
酒瓶  是啊  真好
Flask. Yeah. Oh, that's nice.

284
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,510
你知道  在仪式结束时
You know, at the end of the ceremony,

285
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,140
我要亲一个男人
I kiss a man,

286
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,260
所以你把酒瓶装满做好准备吧
so you might want to fill 'er up.

287
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,660
你就这么解决问题吗
This is how you try to fix things?

288
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,020
-把她灌醉  -别怪他
- You get her drunk? - Don't blame him.

289
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,080
自从她去了那个
She's been a loose cannon

290
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
十点半开始祈祷仪式的教堂
ever since she started going

291
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,890
她就变成了一个定时炸弹
to that church service that starts at 10:30.

292
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,390
他们还弹吉他呢
They play guitar music.

293
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,080
那是个庆祝活动
It's a celebration.

294
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,610
那是个罪恶之城
It's gomorrah.

295
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,660
牧师还戴着麦当娜唱歌用的麦克风呢
The pastor wears one of them madonna microphones.

296
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,180
什么麦当娜唱歌用的麦克风
Oh, madonna microphones.

297
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,380
我的小玉米须哪里去了
Where's my little corn silk?

298
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,020
这事结束之后你想去做点儿有意思的事吗
Hey, you want to go out and do something fun after this thing?

299
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,330
不  我想今晚在家呆着
No, I was thinking about staying in tonight

300
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:06,570
好好陪陪乔
and spending some time with joe.

301
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,080
自从有了那孩子
Ugh, you never want to do anything

302
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,850
你就什么都不想做了
since that baby came along.

303
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,050
-你怎么样  -我很好
- How are you? - I'm good.

304

结婚证  戒指  签字笔  祝酒词吗
Marriage license, rings, signing pen, toast?

306
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:15,990
是的  当然都带了
Yes, of course.

307
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,660
不然怎么会叫我伴人[最棒的人]呢
There's a reason I'm the best person.

308
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,440
这只是在今天才有的称呼而已
You know that's just a title for today, right?

309
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,390
是的  我是这个婚礼上最棒的人
Yeah, I'm the best person at this wedding.

310
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,500
我还是会听到...  那是什么
I'm still kind of hearing -- what is that?

311
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,640
我的天  我的上帝

312
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,580

314
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,780
-亲爱的  -别看我

315
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,990
我只有那一个胸花

316
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,010
你姐姐哪去了
Where's your sister?

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,580
海莉
Haley?

318
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,870
安迪  你还在这里呢
Andy! You're still here?

319
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,740

因为天气原因我的航班一直被推迟

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,290
等等  火灾算天气原因吗
Wait. Is fire weather?

323
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,110
-着火了吗  -是的
- There was a fire? - Yeah.

324
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,680
怪不得你的裙子热辣得冒烟
Guess that explains that smoking dress.

325
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,020
注意分寸  安迪
Line, Andy.

326
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,440
那个  如果你想打发时间
Well, if you're -- if you're just killing time,

327
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,220
新的婚宴场地就在附近
the new wedding venue is nearby.

328
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,190
你完全可以过来转转
You could totally come and hang.

329
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,370
我觉得我的穿着不太合适
I don't think I'm exactly dressed for it.

330
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,220
当然如果我跟你在一起
Of course, if I was with you,

331
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,720
没有人会去看我的
no one would even look at me.

332
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,410
好了
Wow, okay.

333
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,980
你馅饼吃得够多了  年轻人
That is quite enough pie for you, young man.

334
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,360
我得回去了
Ugh. I've got to get back.

335
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,560
那个  我来这里不是为了喝咖啡的
Um, look, I didn't come here for coffee.

336
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,710
安迪  我觉得你不应该
Andy, I don't think it's a good idea

337
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,740
上这班飞机
for you to get on that plane.

338
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,370
我不觉得贝丝值得你这样付出
I don't think Beth is worth it.

339
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,790
你根本不了解贝丝
You don't even know Beth.

340
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,930
我想我了解
I think I do.

341
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,390
我想我之前和她一样
I think I've been her.

342
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,450
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

343
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,840
你写十封信她只回一封
For every 10 letters you write, she writes one.

344
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,780
她永远是先挂断电话的那个人
She's always the one who ends the phone call.

345
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:35,380
你不经意间提起你自己的生日
You happen to mention when your birthday's coming up

346
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,710
因为你心里知道她早已经忘了
because you know deep down she's already forgotten it.

347
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,810
与此同时  她给你的刚好够拴住你的心
Meanwhile, she gives you just enough to keep you on the hook.

348
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:48,840
喂
Hello?

349
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,330
我当然没走  妈妈

几秒钟前你才从我身边路过

我想说的是  你值得拥有更好的

352
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,830
我的天啊
Oh, my god!

00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,340
我正跟你招手呢
I'm waving at you!

354
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,070
站着别动
Stay where you are!

355

你是花童
You're the flower girl.

359
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,440
给别人花是你的工作
It's part of your job.

360
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,610
好好读读你的合同  谢谢
Read the fine print. Thank you.

拜托拜托  快来
Come on, come on, come on.

365
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,270
亲爱的  我不确定该不该变魔术
Oh, honey, I don't know about the magic trick.

366
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,250
你不觉得大家应该把注意力
Don't you think people should be

367
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,770
集中在小卡和米奇身上吗
focused on Cam and Mitch?

368
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,040
我正希望是  他们是完美的掩饰

370
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,940
-你拿着戒指  -好吧
- You hold the rings. - Okay.

371
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,070
我说  "人们说最好的婚姻
I say, "They say the best marriages

372
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,880

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,090
我们举起手臂
We hold up our arms.

374
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,120
你放开戒指
You let go of the rings.

375
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,430
戒指顺着线滑下来
They slide down the thread

376
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,240
仿佛神奇地飘过来一样
as if mysteriously floating

377
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,970
一路滑到  中间位置
all the way -- half the way to me.

378
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,110
莫尔  我知道你和杰谈过之后

"星期二快乐  是吧"
And say, "Happy Tuesday, huh?"

393
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,800
酒保回答说
The bartender replies,

394
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,000
你想说的是"圣诞快乐"吧
"Don't you mean 'Merry Christmas'?"

395
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,690
看到了吧  莫尔
You see, Merle?

00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,380
第二喜欢
Second?

408
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,760
我最喜欢你生日穿的那套
Right after your birthday suit.

409
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,650
别说了  人家都是已婚男人了
Hey. Cut it out. I'm practically a married man.

410
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,870
我知道
I know.

411
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,800
我刚刚被你爸说的话吓到了
You know, you scared me earlier with what your dad said.

412
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,670
怎么了
W-what?

413
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,850
就是关于山火
Well, just about the fire, you know...

414
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,810
预示着我们不该结婚的事
being a sign we shouldn't get married.

415
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,790
有点末日预言的感觉
It was kind of apocalypticy.

416
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,470
-才不是呢  -然后天就黑了
- No. - Then the sky turned dark.

417
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,800
没错  因为有山火
Yeah, because of the fire.

418
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,840
然后发了"洪水"
Well, and then we had a flood.

419
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,680
你懂的  萨尔的羊水破了
You know, Sal -- sploosh.

420
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,070
我觉得你脑洞开得有点大
I think you're stretching just a little bit.

421
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,060
因为我们花钱订了房间
Because we paid for this room!

422
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,440
卢卡斯夫妇  我们只要20分钟
Mr. and Mrs. Lucas, we just need 20 minutes!

423
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,660
把音乐停下
Cut the boy soprano.

424
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,580
不行  让这些人都出去
No, we need these people out of here!

425
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,640
你还是想逃婚对不对
I can see you want to run again, don't you?

426
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,820
追随你的心
Follow your heart.

427
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,510
各就各位  预备  过自己的生活去吧
On your mark, get set, live, baby!

428
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,560
你不需要这个
You don't need that!

429
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,610
你不觉得这又是一个上帝的旨意吗
You don't see this as another biblical sign?

430
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,220
乔治・卢卡斯: 其公司出品的一款星战游戏
不允许同性角色之间产生恋情

431
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,220
一大群卢卡斯们
A swarm of "Lucases."

432
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,790
各位  安排有点小变动
Slight change, everyone!

433
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,670
不用担心
Don't worry!

434
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,550
我们有第三套备用方案
There's always a plan "C"!

435
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,110
天呐  到处都是蝴蝶
Oh! They're everywhere!

436
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,820
你们都是什么毛病啊
What is wrong with you people?

437
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,760
别去动盒子了
Leave the box alone!

438
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,710
要是把那个拿进来
Oh, if that thing is coming in,

439
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,070
更多宾客就得站到草坪上去了
we need to put a few more people on the lawn.

440
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,800
这个地方还算舒适吧
Okay, this place is cozy, right?

441
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,420
没错  没错  没错
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

442
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,640
这里很好  一切都会好的
It's fine. It's -- oh, it's going to be fine.

443
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,210
就是  就是  就是
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:51,960
不过我们可能需要
Although we may need to

445
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,440
让一部分宾客坐到楼上
sit some of the overflow guests upstairs.

446
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,150
楼上不是我们的
Oh, we don't -- we don't own the upstairs.

447
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,000
是吗
Really?

448
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,950
我一直以为你家还有更好的地方
I always assumed there was a nicer part

449
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,310
没让我看过
you weren't showing me.

450
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,400
确保他们把账单都付清
Make sure their checks have cleared.

451
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,360
再找一个餐饮服务商来
Just get another caterer here

452
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,880
不然这些人就只能喝蝴蝶汤了
or these people will be eating butterfly bisque!

453
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,100
我在尝试冷静下来
Okay, I'm trying to remain calm,

454
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,250
可是你不觉得这又是一个凶兆吗
but you realize that's another sign of the apocalypse, right?

455
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,060
饥荒吗
Famine?

456
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,670
他听起来跟斯蒂芬和斯特凡
He sounds as bad as Steven, Stefan,

457
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,390
和朗吉娜一样糟
and Longines.

458
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,390
末世论中天启四骑士分别代表瘟疫  战争  饥荒和死亡

459
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,450
你是想说我们有四个
Oh, so what you're saying

460
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,960
嘶哑的男人[骑士]吗
is we have four hoarse men?

461
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,430
别皱着眉头了
Stop with the frowning.

462
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,990
今天要为你们的儿子保持笑容
Today, you smile for your son.

463
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,790
明天你们想做什么都可以
Tomorrow, you can do whatever you want.

464
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,690
明天我大概就搬出去了
Tomorrow, I might just move out.

465
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,790
现在我感觉到笑意了
Oh, now I feel a smile coming on.

466
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,750
天啊  你在给安迪发短信吗
Oh, my god. You're texting Andy now?

467
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,340
我只是告诉他愿意的话可以来玩
I'm just letting him know he can hang out here if he wants.

468
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,130
海莉  我希望你知道自己在干什么
Haley, I hope you know what you're doing.

469
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,500
我什么也没做
I'm not doing anything.

470
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,680
你要是真的喜欢他是一回事
I mean, it's one thing if you're actually into him,

471
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,570
可如果你只是想
but if you're just playing around with him

472
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,640
跟他玩玩
for the fun of it...

473
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,970
对于安迪这种单纯善良的人来说
Here's the thing about nice, quiet dorks like Andy.

474
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,930
我们需要花比你多得多的时间
You get over us much faster than

475
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,030
放下一段感情
we get over you.

476
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,920
不好意思  真对不起
Hi. Sorry. So sorry.

477
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,960
不好意思  里面是我老公
Excuse me. It's my husband.

478
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,210
人们说最好的婚姻
"They say the best marriages" --

479
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,350
我不是要催你
I don't mean to rush you,

480
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,490
可是外面已经排了有80多个人了
but there's like 80 people waiting to get in here.

481
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,510
不不不  你来了正好
No, no, no. I'm so glad you're here.

482
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,110
我刚想到了一个新的魔术
I just worked up a new magic trick.

483
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,220
我先说  "人们说最好的婚姻
I start by saying, "They say the best marriages

484
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,080
需要一点点魔力"
contain just a little bit of magic."

485
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,810
而袖子里装着我从莉莉柜子里找到的
Then in my sleeves, I've rigged two confetti poppers

486
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,380
两管彩色纸屑
that I found in Lily's closet.

487
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,620
到时我一抬手
So when I raise my arms...

488
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,320
真的吗  你怎么不说"别这么做"
Really? You're not gonna say, "Don't do that"?

489
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,660
不  我不觉得这是个好主意
No, I mean, I don't think you need the magic trick,

490
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,770
可是如果你要做  效果一定会很好
but if you do it, I'm sure you'll be great.

491
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,920
亲爱的
Oh, honey.

492
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,030
天啊  别动我来  亲爱的  不
Oh, god, let me get that. Honey! No!

493
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,470
亲爱的  不  小心
Honey, no! Hey!

494
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,890
菲尔  不
Phil! Oh, no!

495
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,480
不要  水开了  水开了
No, no, water's on! Water's on!

496
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,680
不  你
No! You --

497
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,670
-请稍等  -请稍等
-Just a minute. - Just a minute.

498
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,180
-你好  安迪  -你好
-Hey Andy. - Hey.

499
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,730
婚礼开始了吗
Has the wedding started yet?

500
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,350
开始好几次了
Oh, yeah, lots of times.

501
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,490
-怎么了  -没什么
-What's up? - Oh, nothing.

502
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,970
你之前说的关于我值得更好的人
Hey, that thing you said before about me deserving better,

503
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,300
你就那么一说  对吧
you just meant, like, in general, right?

504
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,720
你不是在说某个特定的人对吧
You weren't thinking of anyone in particular?

505
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,490
对  不  我的意思是你值得拥有幸福
Yeah, no, I-I just meant you deserve to be happy.

506
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,810
如果这个女孩能让你幸福  再好不过
And if it's this girl, great.

507
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,910
如果不是她  那也很好
If not, great.

508
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,130
有些时候  最难的事
Um, sometimes the hardest part

509
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,870
是弄清楚自己想要什么
is just figuring out what you want.

510
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,590
我也是这么想的
Yeah, that's what I thought.

511
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,650
玩得开心
Well, enjoy the wedding.

512
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,310
谢谢  一路平安
Thanks. Have a nice trip.

513
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,430
再见
Yeah. I'll see you.

514
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,610
新婚

515
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,480
真高兴我们做到了
I'm so glad we did this.

516
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,870
那当然  我们这么认真
I know. Who were we kidding?

517
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,230
必须能做到
It was so gonna happen.

518
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,350
实在太搞笑了
I can't get enough of this.

519
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,670
不  米奇没事  不过还在生我的气
No, Mitch is fine. Still mad at me, though.

520
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,320
你也知道他有时是多么敏感易怒  迪迪
You know how touchy he can be, Dede.

521
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,570
你还记得在他第一次参加完滑冰比赛后
Remember when we tried to cheer him up

522
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,860
我们试图哄他开心的事吗
after his first ice-skating competition?

523
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,190
我们怎么知道第三名是好事啊
How were we supposed to know third place is a good thing?

524
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,120
还记得他穿着旱冰鞋
Remember he tromped off

525
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,210
在泥地里乱踩的场景吗
across that muddy field in his skates?

526
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,020
他像个猛犸象一样陷了下去
He sunk like a woolly mammoth.

527
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,600
对了迪迪  如果你国庆节时有空的话
Hey, Dede, if you're around the fourth of July,

528
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,710
就过来观看一下婚礼录像吧
you should come by and watch the wedding video.

529
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,810
不  我们八月会出城
No, we're out of town in August.

530
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,910
好吧  很快的  好的
All right. Well, soon. Okay.

531
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,610
迪迪  我好像没有你的新...
Oh, Dede, I don't think I have your new --

532
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,280
好了  见证奇迹的时刻到了
Okay, it's magic time, everyone!

533
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,540
菲尔  请在庄严的拱门下就位
Phil, please take your place beneath our majestic arch.

534
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,090
开始演奏吧
Cue the quartet.

535
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,600
还有一个人去哪儿了
Where's the other one?

536
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,960
他跟那个把货车开翻了的餐饮承办员跑了
He rode with the caterer who flipped his truck.

537
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,340
为什么大家都摊上了好事  就我没有呢
Why do good things happen to everyone but me?

538
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,680
赶快派上花童吧
Let's send the flower girl

539
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,510
再等她就长成花季少女了
before she's a flower teenager.

540
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,710
好悲伤
Oh, so sad.

541
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,590
抱歉
Sorry.

542
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,260
-搞毛  -行了  搞得像问题出在我身上一样
- What is ... - Yeah. Like I'm the problem.

543
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,610
你爸在这儿吗
Is your dad here?

544
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,860
是的  他应该很快就...
Yeah, he should be right --

545
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,520
天啊
Oh -- oh, my god.

546
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,000
他在外面人行道上打电话呢
He's out on the sidewalk on the phone.

547
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,390
你需要我去叫他吗
Do you want me to go get him?

548
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,760
不  不想  我们就...算了
No, no, I don't. Let's just -- come on.

549
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
我们直接开始吧
Let's just do this.

550
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,060
米奇尔
Mitchell.

551
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,450
你真的想就这样完成婚礼吗
Is this really how you want to get married?

552
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,510
是不理想
Well, it's not ideal.

553
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,270
不行  人们都没有米可抛洒
No, people don't have any rice to throw

554
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,380
因为他们都饿得吃生米了
because they're chewing it raw out of starvation.

555
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,370
一半的宾客在外面的草坪上
Half of our guests are on the lawn and...

556
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,160
洒水车来了
There go the sprinklers.

557
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,700
好吧  我们宣布"婚礼死亡"算了吧
Okay, let's just call time of death on this.

558
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,000
好吧
All right, yeah.

559
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,300
那个  大家  非常感谢你们
Hey, everybody, um, thank you so much

560
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,370
今天承受这么多的折腾
for, uh, for dealing with all this today.

561
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,270
那对我们意义重大
It means a lot to us.

562
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,200
但不幸的是  这场婚礼实在...
But unfortunately, this is not gon--

563
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,970
停  你不能这么做
Stop. You can't do this.

564
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,790
我已经赶在你前面停止了
I'm way ahead of you, dad,

565
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,880
谢谢你能赏光过来
and thank you for stopping by.

566
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,990
我的意思是  你不能像这样草草就结婚
What I mean is, you can't get married like this.

567
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,390
你们两个值得拥有一场
You two deserve the kind of wedding

568
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,030
你们在过去的9个月中
you've been talking about nonstop

569
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,280
不停挂在嘴边的梦幻婚礼
for the last nine months.

570
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,090
你这是什么意思
What do you mean?

571
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,300
你们一有机会就会谈论婚礼
You bring it up every chance that you get.

572
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,850
我知道"不停"二字是什么意思
I know what nonstop means!

573
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,200
相信我  好吗
Trust me, okay?

574
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,130
我们都站在这儿干嘛啊
Now, what are we all standing around for?

575
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,320
我儿子今天要结婚了
My son's getting married today.

576
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,860
恭喜  杰
All right, Jay.

577
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,620
那正是这所高尔夫俱乐部需要的
It's what this golf club needs.

578
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,480
改变一下旧风貌
Shake it up a little.

579
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,250
上吧  小宝贝
Go on, dear.

580
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,330
爸爸们能结几次婚啊
How often do your fathers get married?

581
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,490
目前已经结了一次  两次
So far, one, two...

582
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,040
你赶紧给我滚出吧
Why am I still seeing you?

583
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,400
你可以坐下了  老爸
You can take your seat, dad.

584
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,500
我们要开始了
We're about to start.

585
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,130
我觉得我们父子俩要小走一段
Actually, I thought you and I would take a little walk.

586
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,990
我感觉一切仿如昨日
I remember it like it was yesterday --

587
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,550
米奇尔被从医院抱回的那天
The day that Mitchell came home from the hospital

588
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:10,000
身上裹着土的掉渣的白色尿布
in a very unfashionable white diaper

589
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,140
头上是三缕杂乱分布的头发
with three strands of scraggly raggedy andy hair.

590
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,420
如果他要牵儿子走红毯  那我也要
If he's doing it, I'm doing it.

591
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,650
你一起来吗  巴布
You coming, Barb?

592
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,970
你可真是老甜心
You old sweet talker.

593
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,430
等等我
Wait for me!

594
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,190
我们从此变得不可分离
We were inseparable.

595
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,680
我是他的大姐
I was his big sister,

596
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,560
也是他的大哥  他的死对头
his big brother, his nemesis,

597
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,290
他的保护人  也是他最亲密的朋友
his protector, his best friend.

598
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,860
我的他的第一个搭档
I was his first partner.

599
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,130
我享受当中的每一分每一秒
And I loved every minute of it.

600
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,470
感谢大家参与这一盛大的喜事
Thank you all for being here on this happy occasion.

601
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,800
人们常说最好的婚姻都蕴含着一丝魔力
They say the best marriages contain just a little bit of magic.

602
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,570
相信我
Believe me.

603
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,290
我深有感触
I know.

604
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,230
我们相聚在此  参加一对璧人的婚礼
We're gathered here today to join two amazing people.

605
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:02,290
自然  在由谁来取代我这件事上
So naturally, I was a little picky

606
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,390
我会表现得有一点吹毛求疵
when it came to who was going to be replacing me,

607
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,380
然后我认识了这个叫小卡的人
And then I met this Cam.

608
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,530
当然  他很温暖  风趣  有爱
And sure, he was warm and funny and loving.

609
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,360
卡梅隆  你愿意让米奇尔成为你的丈夫吗
Cameron, do you take Mitchell to be your husband?

610
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,280
我愿意
I do.

611
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,000
卡梅隆  请你为米奇尔戴上戒指
Cameron, would you please place this ring on Mitchell's finger?

612
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,070
米奇尔  你愿意让卡梅隆成为你的丈夫吗
Mitchell, do you take Cameron to be your husband?

613
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,950
我愿意
I do.

614
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,610
那么凭借加州政府授予我的权力
Then by the powers vested in me by the state of California,

615
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,100
我宣布你们结为终身配偶
I am privileged to pronounce you spouses for life.

616
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,420
你们可以行"夫夫吻"了
You may now kiss your husband.

617
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,470
我也曾疑惑
I wondered,

618
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,570
"他真的是我期望
"Was he really

619
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,910
与我弟弟幸福相伴的那个人吗
everything I wanted for my brother?

620
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,460
他真的是最棒的那个人吗"
Was he really the best person?"

621
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,710
不  我才是"伴人"
No, I'm the best person.

622
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,700
现在我想举起杯子
And now I am very pleased to raise a glass

623
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,740
第一次隆重地向大家介绍
And introduce for the first time ever --

624
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,070
尽管这已经是第4次尝试了
on our fourth try --

625
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,030
天造地设的一对夫夫  米奇和小卡
great husbands, Mitch and Cam.

626
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,810
恭喜
Yes!

627
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,920
我看到了
I saw that.

628
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,780
什么啊
What?

629
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,580
你看我老姐的眼神
The way you look at my sister.

630
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,700
你老是这么色眯眯的
You do it all the time, you know.

631
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,750
我才没有呢
I do not.

632
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,470
别当着我的面这样  好吗
Just not in front of me, okay?

633
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,590
你两位老爸去度蜜月了  有跟你联系吗
So, have you heard from your dads on their honeymoon?

634
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,140
你一定很想他们吧
You must really miss them, don't you?

635
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,020
抱歉  我有点小题大做了
Sorry. I was being dramatic.

636
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,260
怎么会  你说得很对
No, you were right.

637
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,440
你会自厌自弃的
You'll hate yourself.

638
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,440
又来了
Right again.

639
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,720
就像他们根本没离开一样
It's like they never left.
