1
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:10,135
- Stop by tonight?
- Three nights in a row.

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,303
That'd be four nights in a row.

3
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:12,490
Well then, forget it.

4
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:13,729
You're gonna cut me off
at three nights in a row?

5
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:14,863
- Three?
- Uh-huh.

6
00:00:14,897 --> 00:00:16,642
There's no way.

7
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:18,310
- Good night.
- Hey.

8
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:19,962
- Hey.
- Hey.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,814
Long day, huh?

10
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:23,916
Did you guys hear,

11
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,651
the detective exam was just announced?

12
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:27,152
Yeah, I heard something about that.

13
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:29,254
Oh, man, that exam is brutal.

14
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:30,722
- Really?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:32,424
If you're gonna take it,
start studying now.

16
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,693
Oh, that's encouraging.

17
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:40,199
So can I walk you out?

18
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,567
Do men still do that?

19
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:43,335
That's not sexist or anything, right?

20
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:44,875
Look at that, it's a gentleman's arm.

21
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:47,906
- Stop it.
- Stop it?

22
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:50,008
Been talking to my dad, he's not so sure

23
00:00:50,043 --> 00:00:51,843
the detective thing's a great idea.

24
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:53,579
More lawsuits. More eyes.

25
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:56,014
But that big city badge...
that would look...

26
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:57,249
pretty good on my hip.

27
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:58,750
How 'bout you?

28
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:00,185
I don't know. I'm thinking it over.

29
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,520
You're "thinking it over?"

30
00:01:01,554 --> 00:01:04,223
You've been dreaming about this since
your first day in the Academy.

31
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:06,692
- I don't believe you for a second.
- Officer Burgess?

32
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:08,360
First Deputy Brennan would like a word.

33
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:09,528
With me?

34
00:01:09,562 --> 00:01:11,563
Yes, ma'am. This way.

35
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:14,349
What happened?

36
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,374
Gun violence isn't the whole story.

37
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:24,876
Overall crime is down 9%.

38
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:26,745
No, it's not fake news. Do you know what?

39
00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:29,047
I am sick of people
saying it's fake news.

40
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:30,324
I gotta jump.

41
00:01:30,917 --> 00:01:32,217
Hi, Kim.

42
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,053
I wanted to congratulate you

43
00:01:35,088 --> 00:01:36,555
on the Jorge Luna bust.

44
00:01:36,589 --> 00:01:39,157
I read all the IPR's and
the supplementary reports.

45
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:40,726
You read all of our reports?

46
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,461
I read everyone's reports.

47
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:45,330
That's how I know you got
those kids out of harm's way.

48
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,599
That was a team effort, ma'am.

49
00:01:47,634 --> 00:01:49,401
Don't run away from a compliment.

50
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:51,178
Gets you nowhere.

51
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,874
I need a favor.

52
00:01:57,944 --> 00:01:59,269
Last week...

53
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,913
I met a pastor... Aqueela Barnes.

54
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:03,448
- Have you heard of her?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:04,950
She has quite a following
on the West Side.

56
00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:06,251
Yes, she does.

57
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:08,086
Her daughter wants to be a cop.

58
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,590
Oh. Okay, I can arrange
a ride along with Patrol.

59
00:02:11,624 --> 00:02:13,892
Or you could take her out yourself.

60
00:02:15,295 --> 00:02:17,329
As a part of his campaign,
Kelton is rebooting

61
00:02:17,363 --> 00:02:18,930
the Explorers Program.

62
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:21,333
We've put a lot of time,
a lot of resources into it.

63
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:22,834
I wanna show it off.

64
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:24,770
Preferably with an up-and-coming young,

65
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:26,905
female cop on our most elite unit.

66
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:31,385
Here's her card.

67
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:34,446
In case you find
the time in your schedule.

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,265
Yeah.

69
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:42,554
Whoa-oh, look at you,
sporting the old blues.

70
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:45,624
Just like old times.
They look a little tight.

71
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:47,225
Don't expect a coffee run.

72
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,960
Your ride along's here.
You clear it with Voight?

73
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:50,729
Yes. I know what I'm doing, Trudy.

74
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:52,664
You remember the rules.
Civilian in the car.

75
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,367
Do not engage. And bring me back a latte.

76
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:56,635
Real milk.

77
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,036
Hey, Kendra.

78
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,738
Hi, I'm Officer Kim Burgess.
How you doing?

79
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:01,640
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

80
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:02,974
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

81
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:04,376
I know how busy you must be, ma'am.

82
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,244
Ooh, let's lose the "ma'am," okay?

83
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,514
Oh... sorry.
My mom likes me to be formal.

84
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:11,416
That's okay. Grab your backpack.

85
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:13,151
It's cute. K for Kendra?

86
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,887
Nah. It's actually um...
it's actually K for Kendrick.

87
00:03:15,922 --> 00:03:17,823
I like it.

88
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:20,525
So why do you wanna be a cop, Kendra?

89
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,662
I'm just tired of people being shot.

90
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:26,064
So, rather than bitch
and moan and just...

91
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,835
Oh, sorry.

92
00:03:29,869 --> 00:03:32,504
That's okay. Cops are allowed to curse.

93
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:36,575
Well, rather than complain,

94
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:38,677
I just figured I'd do something about it.

95
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:40,612
You know? Try to make a difference.

96
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:42,381
Just like your mom.

97
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,516
Mmm... not exactly.

98
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,304
I mean, I believe in God and everything,

99
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:49,221
but he's not gonna
fix Chicago all by himself.

100
00:03:49,255 --> 00:03:51,189
<i>I got a hit on a robbery crew.</i>

101
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:53,859
<i>Guy named Clay Young.
Drives a red 2004 Mustang.</i>

102
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:57,129
<i>Illinois tags. 1-4 Eddie Paul Sam 9-6.</i>

103
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:58,730
<i>My CI thinks they're going to hit a house</i>

104
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,365
<i>on Stone Street, like soon.</i>

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,134
Stone Street. We just passed that.

106
00:04:02,168 --> 00:04:04,536
<i>If anyone's close, take a
peak. Stay in the shadows.</i>

107
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,538
We're gonna check it out, right?

108
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:08,140
No, not with you in the car.

109
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:09,270
Come on, Officer.

110
00:04:09,304 --> 00:04:11,143
No, Kendra. It's not a good idea.

111
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:14,112
But how am I supposed to
learn if I don't see anything?

112
00:04:16,516 --> 00:04:18,049
Please.

113
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:30,595
<i>Now we're gonna put your
police skills to the test.</i>

114
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,901
Okay Kendra. See that red Mustang?

115
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,135
- Yeah.
- Does that match the plates

116
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,237
- we're looking for?
- Sure does.

117
00:04:39,272 --> 00:04:41,606
EPS. Eddie, Paul, Sam.

118
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,808
Whoo. Nice work, Officer.

119
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:44,309
Jay. I got our Mustang.

120
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:45,911
<i>Any sign of our suspect, Clay Young.</i>

121
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,579
<i>Male, white, six-feet tall?</i>

122
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:48,780
No. The car's parked on the corner.

123
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:50,782
No one's inside. I gotta head out.

124
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:56,388
Get down! Get down!

125
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,591
5021 Eddie.
Emergency, multiple shots fired

126
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,259
coming from 1520 West Stone Street.

127
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:03,195
I am pinned in. I got one down.

128
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,429
Roll an ambulance!

129
00:05:05,898 --> 00:05:07,165
Kendra? You stay here!

130
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
You understand me? Stay here!

131
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:14,272
- Sir, are you hurt?
- No.

132
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,440
Get behind me, now!

133
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:16,775
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:18,210
That's right... go, go, go, go!

135
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:19,945
Sir, I saw you're hurt.
I saw you're hurt.

136
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,480
I'm coming to you. Can you hook my arm?

137
00:05:21,514 --> 00:05:23,682
Let's go, come on.
Let's do this together, buddy.

138
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:25,217
You got this! Help me out.

139
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:27,719
All right. Don't worry,
an ambulance is coming.

140
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:28,954
Okay? You stay with me.

141
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:30,655
All right. Hold on, okay?

142
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,624
Hold up... Chicago PD!

143
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:35,327
Drop that weapon!

144
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,729
10-1, 10-1! Shots fired by
offender and the police.

145
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:39,197
Offender on foot in the alley,

146
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:42,167
heading eastbound towards
State. Gray hoodie.

147
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:43,969
Sir! I'm coming back to you, sir!

148
00:05:44,003 --> 00:05:46,004
You're okay. You're okay.

149
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:47,472
Stay with me. I'm not leaving you.

150
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:49,708
Stay with me.

151
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:56,181
What do we got?

152
00:05:56,215 --> 00:05:58,683
He took one to the chest.
Clear that house!

153
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:01,586
Copt that.

154
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,155
Kendra! Are you all right?

155
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,591
Kendra? It's me, okay?

156

159
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:31,116
Two offenders broke in
through the back door.

160
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,685
They entered the dining room,
started opening drawers.

161
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:36,254
Homeowner comes in, surprised 'em.

162
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,523
Yeah, he took two to the chest.

163
00:06:38,558 --> 00:06:40,191
Name's John McCaffery.

164
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,395
Looks like the third shot missed,
went through the window.

165
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:45,697
And that's the one
that hit the pedestrian?

166
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,532
Yeah, bad time for a walk.

167
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:50,107
McCaffery fires back,
clips Offender Number One.

168
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,369
Meet Clay Young.

169
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:52,871
Do we know what happened
to the second offender?

170
00:06:52,905 --> 00:06:54,439
He hightails it through a side door,

171
00:06:54,473 --> 00:06:55,874
engages with Officer Burgess.

172
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:58,076
- Okay. Anything else?
- Talked to Robbery.

173
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,611
They think this is the same crew

174
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,913
that's been hitting the Gold
Coast the past few weeks.

175
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:03,381
Yeah, I figured.

176
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:04,583
All right, thanks, Cullen.

177
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:06,217
Hey, uh, what about the wife?

178
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:09,888
Once the shooting started,
I hid in the bathroom.

179
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:11,323
I should have done something.

180
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:13,058
No, no. You didn't do anything wrong.

181
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:15,560
- I tried to save him...
- Detective?

182
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:17,062
She needs to get to Med.

183
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:19,431
I'm so sorry for your loss.

184
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,602
Hey. Where's Burgess?

185
00:07:23,636 --> 00:07:25,236
I don't know.

186
00:07:25,804 --> 00:07:27,138
All right, what do we got?

187
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:28,406
Two offenders that we know of.

188
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:29,614
They came in through the back courtyard.

189
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,142
The wife didn't see much.

190
00:07:31,177 --> 00:07:33,111
We've got two DOAs inside.

191
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:35,814
The homeowner, John McCaffery,
and one of the bad guys.

192
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:39,184
A, uh, Clay Young, male, white, 37.

193
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:41,853
He's got a long sheet.
Burglary. Meth distro.

194
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:43,254
No gang ties, though.

195
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:45,590
Wife said her husband had a gun,

196
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,026
and he's the one that opened
fire on this Clay Young guy.

197
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,761
And during the shootout,
a bullet came through

198
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:51,196
the window and hit a civilian here.

199
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,731
Wife get a look a look
at the other offender?

200
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,265
She caught a glimpse, but
she ducked into the bathroom

201
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,494
when the bullets started flying.

202
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,102
She said, white male, tall, gray hoodie.

203
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:58,803
Same guy that opened up on Kim.

204
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:00,305
I have two witnesses that saw a big guy

205
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:01,806
with a gray hoodie run out of the house,

206
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:03,375
shooting at a police officer.

207
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:05,276
All right, chase Young's
knowns, dump his phone.

208
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:08,146
Talk to neighbors, check all nearby PODS.

209
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,949
- Excuse me!
- Hey! Are you all right?

210
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:13,051
Look, it all happened really fast, okay?

211
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,519
There was a man down, bleeding.

212
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:16,077
I told Kendra to duck,
to stay in the car...

213
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:18,123
Hold on a second, the girl
was in the car with you?

214
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:20,158
Yeah, I was on a ride along.

215
00:08:20,525 --> 00:08:21,960
But now I can't find her.

216
00:08:21,994 --> 00:08:22,936
I went back to check on her,
and she's gone...

217
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:24,129
Go find her now.

218
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:26,114
We'll talk about the other stuff later.

219
00:08:29,902 --> 00:08:32,137
Excuse me, sir, have you seen this girl?

220
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:33,338
Uh-uh, no, sorry.

221
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:34,906
Why? Did something happen to her?

222
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,741
If you do see her,
can you please call me?

223
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:38,176
Oh, sure, sure. I'll ask around.

224
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,978
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

225
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:42,147
Yo. I heard you took fire.

226
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:44,349
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

227
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:47,919
Kim. Kim, look at me.

228
00:08:48,386 --> 00:08:49,988
You don't look fine.

229
00:08:50,022 --> 00:08:51,306
Are you sure?

230
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:55,460
I had a ride along with me, she ran.

231
00:08:56,228 --> 00:08:58,355
- Well, just find her.
- I've been looking.

232
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:01,833
It's okay. Um...

233
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:04,152
There's a bus stop right there.
Maybe she took the bus home.

234
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:06,771
Let me see the picture.

235
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:08,031
Maybe...

236
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,513
Can I help you?

237
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:17,615
Mrs. Barnes, I'm officer Burgess.

238
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,685
We spoke yesterday.
There's been an incident...

239
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,520
Kendra! Are you okay?

240
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:24,789
Mrs. Barnes, may I please come in?

241
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,299
I would love to speak to Kendra.

242
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:30,929
I'm sorry about all of this.

243
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:32,363
When that guy started shooting at you,

244
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:33,398
I got scared.

245
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:35,033
So, I ran into a coffee shop,

246
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,868
and I started freaking out a little bit.

247
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,737
But then this nice lady
walked into the bus stop.

248
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:40,472
Gave me some money,
and told me to go home.

249
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:42,073
So, let me get this
straight, Officer Burgess.

250
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:44,042
You were out with my daughter on a ride,

251
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:46,111
and you drove smack-dab into a shootout?

252
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:48,046
- How does that happen?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Barnes.

253
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,647
I certainly didn't mean
for this to happen.

254
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,950
There was an emergency call,
a man was shot.

255
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,418
I did what I thought was right...

256
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,320
No disrespect, Ms. Barnes, but my partner

257
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:57,822
is being extremely humble.
She tried to save a man's life.

258
00:09:57,857 --> 00:10:00,492
And almost got my daughter
killed in the process.

259
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:01,826
Mom.

260
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,128
I appreciate you stopping by.

261
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,262
But if there's nothing else...

262
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:05,964
- There is.
- I'm sorry.

263
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:07,432
Kendra, I have to ask you:
did you happen to see

264
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:09,601
the man with the gun?
He was wearing a gray hoodie.

265
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:14,723
No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

266
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,547
There.

267
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:18,443
Thank you.

268
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:22,914
So, we recovered a laptop
in Clay Young's apartment that

269
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:25,450
traces back to a Gold Coast
robbery from two weeks ago.

270
00:10:25,484 --> 00:10:26,951
Well, that's good. But Young's dead.

271
00:10:26,986 --> 00:10:28,987
Do we have anything on
the second offender?

272
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,922
- Nothing so far.
- Nah, we got a name.

273
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:32,590
This is, uh, Trent Stow.

274
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,260
Techs found his fingerprints
all over the Mustang.

275
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,162
- Record?
- Long and impressive.

276
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:38,696
He's a repeat violent offender, this guy.

277
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:41,132
Two armed robberies,
three narcotics charges.

278
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:42,767
Looks like he's into
meth, coke, and heroin.

279
00:10:42,802 --> 00:10:44,602
All right. That makes sense,
'cause the M.E. said

280
00:10:44,637 --> 00:10:46,504
they found high doses
of meth in Young's system.

281
00:10:46,539 --> 00:10:48,640
All right. So we've
got two hopped-up junkies

282
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:50,275
robbing to support their habit.

283
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:53,478
Besides drugs, we find
a nexus between Stow and Young?

284
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:56,181
Yeah, they were busted
ten years ago for a robbery

285
00:10:56,215 --> 00:10:57,649
when they were in college at CCU.

286
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,551
Stow actually played
quarterback for a season.

287
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:01,352
He was a pro prospect until he beat

288
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:02,954
a kid into a coma at a bar.

289
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:05,523
The judge was an alum,
so he got off with probation.

290
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:07,192
He's been busted a few
times for robberies,

291
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:08,493
never convicted. This kid's been getting

292
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,228
a free pass his entire life.

293
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:12,197
Hey Kim, you recognize this guy?

294
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:13,865
No. All I saw was a hoodie.

295
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,801
All right. Bring in Trent Stow.

296
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,470
See if the wife of the victim can ID him.

297
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:22,123
Burgess.

298
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:26,344
How's your ride along doing?

299
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:28,146
Oh, she's fine, thank God.

300
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,981
I never should have engaged
with her in the car.

301
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:31,983
Technically, yes, but, you did

302
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,218
what you thought was right.

303
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:35,153
Yeah. Well, let's hope the review team

304
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:36,487
feels the same way.

305
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:38,223
- When you meet with them?
- Tomorrow.

- Yeah, just tell the truth.

But since he's so innocent, I'm assuming

418
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,169

it of his own free will.
