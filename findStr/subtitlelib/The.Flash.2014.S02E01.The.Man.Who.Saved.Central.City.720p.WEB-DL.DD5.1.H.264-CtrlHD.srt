How to get
your medical license back

698
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,923
So you could start
your practice up again,

699
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:16,459
Or, if you wanted, come work
with us at s.T.A.R. Labs.

700
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,695
I don't know.
I mean--

701
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:21,398
What's wrong? You okay?
- Yeah, it's a party.

702
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,733
Come on, we can talk about
all this tomorrow.

703
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:30,340
- Talk about what?
- Barry...

704
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:34,978
- Are you not planning
on sticking around?

705
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,947
- Okay.

706
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,083
Okay, do you think--

707
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:46,323
Can you be all that
you are becoming...

708
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,893
With me here?

709
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,061
- [chuckles]

710
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:58,601
You're the only family
that i have left.

711
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,507
- Well, that's not
really true, is it?

712
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,544
Don't you have another
family in this room?

713
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:11,281
They need
your help too, barry.

714
00:39:11,283 --> 00:39:14,651
When you need me,
i will be here,

715
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,419
But right now,
central city doesn't need you

716
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,221
To be henry allen's son.

717
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:22,759
It needs you to be
the flash.

718
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:26,996
My kid.

719
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,368
The superhero.

720
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,473
[sighs]

721
00:39:38,176 --> 00:39:40,710
I have to go.

722
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:49,986
I need you to tell me
that it's okay.

723
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,654
- Yeah.

Just feels like every time

Gideon showed us.

00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,964
I was thinking, you know,

744
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,966
You shouldn't fear the future
anymore, right?

745
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,869
- No, and it'll be here
faster than we think.

749
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,945
Increased security

Nothing is getting through here

in and out of here.

The man asked you
a question.

Who the hell are you?
