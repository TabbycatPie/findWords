1
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:11,765
<i> Oh! Someone's had a big off.</i>

2
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,805
<i>Renault made contact there with Haas.</i>

3
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,285
<i>That was a terrorist attack.</i>

4
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:23,525
<i>He just turned into me, mate.</i>

5
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:26,765
<i> Yeah, they're not getting very</i>
<i>close on the walk back there, are they?</i>

6
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:29,765
<i>The midfield this year has been</i>

7
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:32,245
<i>one of the most thrilling battles</i>
<i>we've had in a long time.</i>

8
00:00:34,245 --> 00:00:35,765
<i>There's millions of dollars to play for.</i>

9
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:38,885
<i>And all of it's really boiled down</i>
<i>to just two teams...</i>

10
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,285
<i>Renault and Haas.</i>

11
00:00:43,605 --> 00:00:46,525
<i>It's old Europe</i>
<i>versus the New World.</i>

12
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:50,405
<i>French royalty versus raw American power.</i>

13
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:55,605
If Haas beats us, it would be a disaster.

14
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:58,805
I think it's a great fight.
We're ready to go to war.

15
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:04,325
<i>This battle for fourth place,</i>
<i>it's brilliant and brutal.</i>

16
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:05,885
<i> He pushed me off the track.</i>

17
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:08,525
<i>their drivers don't get on.</i>

18
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:12,725
<i>Magnussen</i>
<i>on the inside with Hülkenberg.</i>

19
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:16,765
<i> Magnussen just ran me</i>
<i>off the track. What a cock!</i>

20
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:19,485
Once again
the most unsporting driver on the grid.

21
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:21,365
-Suck my balls, mate.
-Very good, man.

22
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:22,845
It's a tough rivalry.

23
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:26,205
<i>Renault</i>
<i>really don't wanna be beaten by Haas.</i>

24
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,245
It's a mighty, mighty fight.

25
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,845
<i>Racing, in America, it's in the blood.</i>

26
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:58,525
<i>NASCAR, IndyCar, it's a long history.</i>

27
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:02,285
<i>At Haas F1, we want our drivers</i>
<i>to have that same American passion.</i>

28
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:06,085
<i>You ready for this?</i>

29
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:08,005
I have no idea. We'll see.

30
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:09,045
How's it going?

31
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,525
You'll have fun.

32
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:12,325
What's the worst that can happen?

33
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:18,925
- Piece of cake.
- We've got the ambulance ready, so...

34
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,365
<i>This kind of team</i>
<i>works for me,</i>

35
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:26,085
'cause some Formula One teams go racing
with money

36
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:29,045
and other, you know, Formula One teams
go racing with their heart.

37
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:33,565
<i>Haas is clearly one of those teams</i>
<i>you don't feel like you're racing</i>

38
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,285
for commercial reasons.

39
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:38,405
-So, is the car ready?
-Yeah.

40
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:40,165
Do you know what to do?

41
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,565
Yeah. Flat out.

42
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:50,245
<i>Haas F1 is the first</i>
<i>American team in more than 30 years.</i>

43
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:04,685
<i>When we started it,</i>
<i>everybody told us we would fail.</i>

44
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:08,845
<i>"Why should you guys in America succeed?"</i>

45
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:11,285
Whoo hoo!

46
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:16,765
It's not easy to put together a team
and make it work.

47
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:19,685
<i> Kevin Magnussen's really got</i>
<i>the bit between his teeth.</i>

48
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,805
<i>Haas rise to the occasion once more.</i>

49
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:24,405
<i>Haas have done that in NASCAR.</i>

50
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:28,365
Now in our Formula One third year,
we're already fighting the big boys.

51
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:31,085
- <i> Sensational from Haas!</i>
- Awesome!

52
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,085
Boy, I need a... drink.

53
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:42,845
I don't know what I need.

54
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,245
You just have
to drive like that again this weekend.

55
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:51,765
Are you gonna give me a rub down?

56
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,925
Uh, no.

57
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,005
<i>We're deep in the heart of Texas,</i>

58
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:06,165
<i>the Circuit of the Americas.</i>
<i>It is the United States Grand Prix.</i>

59
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:15,365
Whoo! USA! USA!

60
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:21,165
<i>And for Formula One's</i>
<i>only American team,</i>

61
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:23,165
<i>isn't it great to be back home?</i>

62
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,845
Grosjean! Grosjean!

63
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:32,925
Haas have had
a really up and down season.

64
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:36,525
At the start,
you had Romain Grosjean really going

65
00:04:36,605 --> 00:04:38,405
to pieces in the early races in the year.

66
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,885
<i>But he's found his form</i>
<i>and come back on song.</i>

67
00:04:45,725 --> 00:04:47,965
<i>Grosjean comes home fourth.</i>

68
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:49,685
Whoo hoo!

69
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:56,365
<i>Now both drivers are secured</i>
<i>for another season into 2019.</i>

70
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:59,645
Everything seems
to be coming together for them.

71
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,925
<i>They're confident.</i>
<i>They're hungry to fight.</i>

72
00:05:05,885 --> 00:05:09,765
But coming into Austin,
it really is a massive one.

73
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:14,565
<i>If they can maintain the great performance</i>
<i>that they've shown over recent races,</i>

74
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:18,245
<i>they might just be able</i>
<i>to put one hand on that fourth place</i>

75
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:19,365
in the championship.

76
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,245
What's the general vibe
around the team at the moment?

77
00:05:29,325 --> 00:05:30,325
What's the atmosphere like?

78
00:05:30,405 --> 00:05:32,405
Yeah, the atmosphere is great.
The team is going well.

79
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,485
Very much looking forward to the race.

80
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,885
And I'll just try to bring
some good points back home

81
00:05:37,965 --> 00:05:39,805
and a great show for our fans.

82
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,285
<i>It's very satisfying.</i>

83
00:05:43,805 --> 00:05:46,525
This year, we've got a really good car
for the first time

84
00:05:46,605 --> 00:05:47,605
coming in a home race.

85
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:53,965
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>Austin is a great place for us.</i>

86
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:58,205
We're gonna see a lot of Haas T-shirt,
cap, you know, and flags.

87
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:00,165
Whatsoever we can see on the track.

88
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:05,005
So, we're here for the the fight
with Renault, ready to go to war.

89
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:08,325
Because you wanna fight Renault,
of course.

90
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:09,965
Yeah, that's the big target.

91
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:12,765
I think it's a great fight
and it's a great challenge for us.

92
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:17,565
Yeah, you are fighting Renault, who
is a huge car brand all over the world.

93
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,085
So, how do you see this fight?

94
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:20,285
Well, you're right.

95
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:24,005
You know, Renault's a huge brand,
but they're not the biggest brand

96
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,685
in the United States, I can tell you that.

97
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:29,165
All, uh... regimes come to an end
sooner or later.

98
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:35,405
For Haas to finish fourth
in only their third season would be...

99
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:38,005
uh, frankly it would be--
it would be unbelievable,

100
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:42,325
<i>because the team they're up against</i>
<i>Renault... is one of,</i>

101
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:46,325
if not the biggest auto manufacturer
in the world.

102
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:51,125
<i>They have a wealth of experience</i>
<i> in not just competing in Formula One,</i>

103
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,325
<i>but winning world championships.</i>

104
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:56,765
<i>It is however, at the moment,</i>
<i>a midfield team</i>

105
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:59,045
<i>trying desperately to rebuild itself.</i>

106
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:04,645
And in the balance of where we are
from a competitive standpoint right now,

107
00:07:04,725 --> 00:07:08,405
Renault lost their momentum
and they need to get it back.

108
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:13,005
<i>Renault seem to have stalled a bit</i>
<i>in terms of their point scoring of late.</i>

109
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,365
<i>They're still hanging on</i>
<i>to fourth place, but only just.</i>

110
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:20,845
<i>Eight points separate them</i>
<i>from their American rivals.</i>

111
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:24,245
<i>And if their recent form</i>
<i>is anything to go by,</i>

112
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:26,525
<i>it's not looking good for the French.</i>

113
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:33,725
<i> Oh, no.</i>

114
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,725
<i>Nightmare for Renault.</i>

115
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,885
<i>And that's Nico Hülkenberg into the wall.</i>

116
00:07:49,405 --> 00:07:50,605
Where are Renault
at the moment?

117
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:53,685
Because it does look as though it's been
a bit of a struggle the last few races.

118
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,165
Well, we are where we are. I mean...

119
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:57,805
But in terms of the true form
of the team, though,

120
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:03,325
you were looking so strong
in fourth and now... it's not ideal.

121
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:04,925
Um...

122
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:08,885
<i>What has happened?</i>
<i>Oh, the Renault goes wide.</i>

123
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,445
<i>Is he gonna try and launch?</i>
<i>Oh, no!</i>

124
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:13,925
<i>The Renault's made contact there.</i>

125
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:18,445
<i>Carlos Sainz is out of this race.</i>

126
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:25,325
We are fourth. That's the reality,
but it is a very tough midfield.

127
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:29,205
And since Barcelona,
they've been a faster car than us,

128
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:32,485
really, so, uh, that's worrying.

129
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:35,845
<i> Renault, at the moment,</i>
<i>is in a very tricky situation.</i>

130
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:39,725
I think if, if Haas beats us,
it would be a disaster.

131
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:43,765
I think we all know how important
that fourth place is for Renault.

132
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:47,525
I think we all feel it inside the team.
We feel the pressure.

133
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:52,605
What you have to understand about Renault
is that they've invested millions

134
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,725
in their pursuit of the top three teams.

135
00:08:54,805 --> 00:08:56,845
That means there's a huge amount
of expectation on them,

136
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:59,565
not only from their shareholders,
but from the whole of France.

137
00:09:01,405 --> 00:09:06,125
Renault's connected to the French people.
It's a partly state-owned company.

138
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:10,645
Um, so it's a huge responsibility,
so you don't want to mess it up.

139
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:14,925
<i>This year, fourth is very important to us.</i>

140
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:18,965
We need to show to the world
that our ambition to become a top team

141
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:21,605
and fight with the best is credible.

142
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:24,645
<i>I just hope you see</i>
<i>it's a stepping platform</i>

143
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:26,685
<i>if we want to join the top three.</i>

144
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:31,205
<i>But coming in to Austin,</i>
<i>it's difficult to hide the fact</i>

145
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,885
we've lost confidence.

146
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:43,285
Proper music, huh?

147
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,205
Welcome to Texas.

148
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:48,925
Bleh.

149
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:52,205
When the weather is like this here,
it's like...

150
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:56,485
Let's talk a little bit
about the threat of Haas. Have they...

151
00:09:56,565 --> 00:09:58,365
Haas? Who are they?
I've never heard about them.

152
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:01,045
They're just
this other little American team.

153
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,605
-There is an American team?
-I think so, yeah.

154
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:05,445
Did you know?

155
00:10:07,965 --> 00:10:09,285
<i>I'm Nico Hülkenberg.</i>

156
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:11,325
<i>I'm 30 years old from Germany</i>

157
00:10:11,405 --> 00:10:13,885
<i>and I drive</i>
<i>for Renault Sport Formula One team.</i>

158
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:18,045
<i>Well, the atmosphere could be better.</i>

159
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:20,205
<i>It's challenging. Everyone realizes that.</i>

160
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:24,005
Um... many things didn't go
the way we wanted them to go.

161
00:10:24,765 --> 00:10:27,445
<i>But we have to focus on what is ahead.</i>

162
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:30,605
It's all about the race.
The race is the only thing that counts.

163
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:35,605
Nico Hülkenberg!

164
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:38,925
You're famous!

165
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:42,605
Hello. How are you guys?

166
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,005
Wait, how much races did you win?

167
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,365
- None yet, unfortunately. Yeah.
- Oh, wait, really?

168
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:48,925
How are you famous?

169
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,845
-Wait, you didn't win any?
-No.

170
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:55,165
Do you have a good mindset?
Do you think you will win?

171
00:10:56,165 --> 00:10:58,765
It's not so easy. It's very hard
to achieve, you know.

172
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,205
So, how many races
 have you ever won?

173
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,165
Quite a few.

174
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:04,525
- Microsoft! I wanna play games.
- But in Formula One, not so many!

175
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,005
- They're disappointed.
- This Sunday!

176
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:07,645
This Sunday, I'll try. I'll go for it.

177
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:19,445
<i> Expectations, you know...</i>
<i>I've had to deal with them all my career.</i>

178
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:25,725
<i>My personal expectations to myself</i>
<i>are probably higher than anyone else.</i>

179
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,645
<i>This is what I've been dreaming about</i>

180
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:31,045
<i>and worked towards</i>
<i>since I am eight years old.</i>

181
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:34,605
Nico...

182
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:38,845
Nico Hülkenberg has been viewed

183
00:11:38,925 --> 00:11:43,285
as this champion-in-waiting for a decade.

184
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,085
<i>Phenomenally successful in junior career,</i>

185
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:52,765
<i>but just never achieved what everybody</i>
<i>thought he would in Formula One.</i>

186
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:57,245
This is a guy who now holds the record
for the most races without a podium.

187
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:01,885
<i> Oh, dear. Boom!</i>
<i>Front wing just fell off.</i>

188
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:03,565
<i> That is dreadful luck.</i>

189
00:12:04,485 --> 00:12:07,205
<i>Hülkenberg goes off the track,</i>
<i>losing his left wheel.</i>

190
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:13,805
<i>Hülkenberg, for the second year</i>
<i>in a row, is out of this race.</i>

191
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,565
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh!

192
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:18,165
<i>He is frustrated.</i>

193
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:21,725
<i>He is frustrated, having been,</i>
<i>most of his life, a midfielder.</i>

194
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:29,405
All of these years spent
without podium, without wins.

195
00:12:30,325 --> 00:12:33,765
<i>I mean, no, Nico, given the right car,</i>
<i>is capable of being world champion.</i>

196
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:37,885
He is world champion material,
there is no doubt about that.

197
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:41,165
<i>I'm getting older,</i>

198
00:12:41,245 --> 00:12:43,325
<i>but, you know, I still have</i>
<i> that aim and the goal</i>

199
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:45,885
<i>to become Formula One world champion</i>
<i>and to win races.</i>

200
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,245
<i>I wanna-- You know,</i>
<i>I will keep going and not lift off</i>

201
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:49,765
<i>till I have achieved that.</i>

202
00:12:51,285 --> 00:12:53,605
<i>And now with Renault, you know,</i>
<i>I have a team and a partner,</i>

203
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:54,965
<i>because believe I can.</i>

204
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,925
<i>But first we have to get</i>
<i>to that fourth place.</i>

205
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,445
And beat Haas.

206
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:10,045
<i> Ladies and gentlemen, Gene Haas.</i>

207
00:13:12,565 --> 00:13:15,885
It looks like an incredibly competitive
weekend for your boys.

208
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:19,045
Yeah, our competitors are just
pains in the butt.

209
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:21,085
- Yeah, but--
- So you just get out of the way.

210
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:25,085
Are you optimistic?
Renault's having a bit of a wobble.

211
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:27,085
-What do you think?
-Yes.

212
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:28,405
Correct.

213
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:30,085
Thank you. Thank you.

214
00:13:30,165 --> 00:13:32,925
<i>Coming into race day, there'll</i>
<i>be a massive feeling of excitement</i>

215
00:13:33,005 --> 00:13:33,925
<i>in the Haas F1 camp.</i>

216
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:38,005
They might have been underdogs earlier
in the season, but they're not anymore.

217
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,565
<i>Remember, they've got a Ferrari engine,</i>
<i>and the way they've developed this car</i>

218
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:43,805
<i>during the year</i>
<i>has now made them much faster</i>

219
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:45,325
<i>than their French counterparts.</i>

220
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:49,125
You would really have to say
that this race is theirs for the taking.

221
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:55,325
We all know that we're
in the fight for fourth.

222
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:59,205
It's getting tight now. For sure,
Renault will try to win it as well.

223
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,405
I'm confident
with the performance of the car.

224
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:04,525
Just keep focused, do what you're doing.

225
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:07,965
Do not change anything.
Just do always-- get to the best,

226
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:10,045
and, uh... we will finish fourth.

227
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:14,565
You know, a lot of people wouldn't have
given us any chance to achieve this.

228
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:18,405
Renault has got three or four times
the amount of people we have got.

229
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:19,885
More than double the budget we have got.

230
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:24,965
But I think Renault has realized
that, at the track, they cannot beat us.

231
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:29,125
Hey, you know, Kevin,
you'll get a chance to beat Nico as well.

232
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:31,765
That, I think, means a lot to him.

233
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,725
There's a bit of history
between Magnussen and Hülkenberg,

234
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:41,685
and part of it stems
from Magnussen's own history with Renault.

235
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:43,405
<i>He used to drive for that team</i>

236
00:14:43,485 --> 00:14:46,365
<i>and felt Renault didn't have enough faith</i>
<i>in him to try and keep him.</i>

237
00:14:47,445 --> 00:14:49,605
<i>He was replaced by Nico.</i>

238
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:52,285
<i>So, Kevin Magnussen's</i>
<i>definitely had a point to prove.</i>

239
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:57,965
<i>It's going to be a dirty race.</i>

240
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:02,605
Kevin and Nico don't get on... at all.

241
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,525
<i>Magnussen just ran me off the track.</i>

242
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:16,845
How can I-- How can I say?
It's-- It's a tough rivalry.

243
00:15:17,725 --> 00:15:20,125
When it comes to racing, he's just nasty.

244
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:23,445
And what he does is just, you know,
ruthless, being an asshole, basically.

245
00:15:23,565 --> 00:15:25,765
<i> It's no secret.</i>
<i>I can't wait to beat him.</i>

246
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:30,085
It's a big target for me, personally.
You know, it is what it is.

247
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:34,805
<i>A lot of people say Kevin</i>
<i> is the bad boy of Formula One.</i>

248
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,365
<i>But he's a pure racer.</i>
<i>He fights for everything.</i>

249
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:39,285
<i>He doesn't leave anything behind.</i>

250
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:40,605
<i>You know, he would never give up.</i>

251
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:44,205
And he can be
one of the best in Formula One.

252
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,485
<i>So, it all comes down to this.</i>

253
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:55,965
<i>The outcome of this race</i>
<i>could transform the fortunes</i>

254
00:15:56,045 --> 00:15:57,565
<i>of one of these teams.</i>

255
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:04,885
<i>On the grid,</i>
<i>Renault and Haas are side by side today.</i>

256
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,365
<i>Who's got the fastest pace?</i>

257
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:09,765
<i>Who can show what they're made of</i>
<i>when it really matters?</i>

258
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:44,645
<i>We've been</i>
<i>very neck-and-neck the whole year.</i>

259
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,725
<i>But I feel like this is the chance</i>
<i>to actually prove which of us</i>

260
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:52,605
<i>is better as individuals,</i>
<i>as racing drivers.</i>

261
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,925
<i> Radio check, mate.</i>
<i>Radio check.</i>

262
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:10,005
<i>Track temperature was 29 degrees.</i>

263
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,845
<i>You're just sitting there,</i>
<i>you know, waiting.</i>

264
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:14,965
<i>It's so fucking intense.</i>

265
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:24,645
<i>You feel, like, your heart, you know,</i>
<i>pumping, "boom, boom"</i>

266
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:26,685
<i>and it feels like it's kind of</i>
<i>in your mouth.</i>

267
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,045
<i>At that moment, you just need to function.</i>

268
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:39,365
<i> Everything that</i>
<i>I've worked towards in my career so far</i>

269
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,525
<i>has come purely down to this moment.</i>

270
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:57,365
<i>Very good start indeed</i>
<i>by Nico Hülkenberg in the Renault.</i>

271
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:00,125
<i> Oh, for fuck's sake.</i>

272
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:02,725
<i>Into turn one...</i>

273
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:05,005
<i>Oh! There's contact.</i>

274
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:10,565
<i>Carlos Sainz going wide in the Renault.</i>

275
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:14,685
<i> Fuck! Come on!</i>

276
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:22,005
<i>Fuck.</i>

277
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:26,245
<i>Oh! Grojean's hit Leclerc.</i>
<i>Leclerc's spinning. Grojean's got damage.</i>

278
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:27,525
No!

279
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,085
Oh.

280
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:37,405
<i>Fuck! Front wing.</i>

281
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,005
Box now. Box now.

282
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,685
<i>We have our first retirement</i>
<i>and it's the home team, Haas.</i>

283
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:47,245
<i>- Too much damage on Grosjean's car.</i>
<i>- Oh, that is such a shame.</i>

284
00:18:47,885 --> 00:18:48,805
<i>Sorry.</i>

285
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:52,125
<i> Lap one and Haas</i>
<i>are already a car down.</i>

286
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,245
<i>You think this cannot happen.</i>

287
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:01,805
<i>It's just like realizing</i>
<i>that there was a big opportunity</i>

288
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:03,685
<i>and you cannot make it right again.</i>

289
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:10,285
<i>I was just thinking,</i>
<i>"Please, not again."</i>

290
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:13,685
<i>I was really trying to be careful,</i>

291
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,845
<i>but of course, when it's your home race,</i>
<i>you want to do well.</i>

292
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,845
<i>So, maybe I pushed too hard.</i>

293
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:23,085
You're talking about, "Maybe I brake
two-tenths of a second too late."

294
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:26,045
But at that speed, it's about ten meters

295
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,805
and ten meters means
that you have contact or not.

296
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:34,045
<i>I apologized to all the team.</i>

297
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,285
<i>Obviously, not what we wanted</i>
<i>in the fight with Renault,</i>

298
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:39,445
<i>and, you know, the most painful</i>
<i>at that point</i>

299
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,525
<i>is seeing that Renault,</i>
<i>I think they were sixth and seventh.</i>

300
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:44,445
<i>A big gap for Kevin to, uh, close.</i>

301
00:19:48,765 --> 00:19:52,125
<i>There's more contact.</i>
<i>And another car spinning off.</i>

302
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,125
<i>Wow!</i>

303
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:59,325
<i>You're doing a great job, Nico.</i>

304
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:04,925
<i>Grosjean out of the race.</i>
<i>Magnussen is P-10.</i>

305
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:07,645
<i>You know, you need to</i>
<i>be really focused in that moment.</i>

306
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:11,845
<i>You might have a good start,</i>
<i>but Kevin is quick.</i>

307
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:14,565
He's always gonna be
a serious, you know, threat to us.

308
00:20:16,445 --> 00:20:20,325
<i>Stay positive,</i>
<i>stay positive. It's a long race ahead.</i>

309
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:22,885
<i>With one driver...</i>

310
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:26,405
sure, it's more difficult now,
but in racing, you never give up.

311
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:31,405
<i>In situations like this,</i>
<i>you race hard, you know.</i>

312
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,245
<i>Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i>turning it up a notch.</i>

313
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,925
<i>If he wants to catch those Renaults,</i>

314
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:41,005
<i>he's gonna have to fight his way</i>
<i>through that midfield.</i>

315
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:44,325
<i>All the responsibility</i>
<i>is on you...</i>

316
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:48,765
<i>and I'm not willing</i>
<i>to make any compromises.</i>

317
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:53,405
<i> Fucking hell.</i>
<i>They're just really slow.</i>

318
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:56,165
<i>Keep on pushing, Kevin.</i>

319
00:20:58,365 --> 00:20:59,805
-Go on, mate.
-Go on.

320
00:21:02,005 --> 00:21:04,445
<i> Kevin Magnussen</i>
<i> is closing the gap.</i>

321
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,045
<i>But with both Renaults</i>
<i>in point-scoring positions,</i>

322
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:17,205
<i>Haas have a mountain to climb.</i>

323
00:21:23,565 --> 00:21:26,525
Sainz was after the curb
on turn one, you know?

324
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:30,085
So you think Sainz got
an advantage by doing this?

325
00:21:31,245 --> 00:21:32,925
It's a big advantage to them.

326
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:36,365
Can you please have a look
at the start of Sainz,

327
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:39,165
because he apparently cut
the corner totally,

328
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:40,885
you know, to get an advantage.

329
00:21:42,565 --> 00:21:44,485
<i>What were we supposed to do?</i>

330
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:45,885
The Renaults were in front of us.

331
00:21:45,965 --> 00:21:49,245
We cannot sit back and just see,
"Oh, maybe we get lucky

332
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:51,045
<i>and they retire</i>
<i>and then we get the points."</i>

333
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:52,605
No. You need to go
and attack at that point,

334
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,045
because there's nothing left to lose.

335
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,565
<i>Carlos, we have a situation.</i>

336
00:21:58,205 --> 00:21:59,205
<i> What?</i>

337
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,325
<i> Carlos has a five-second penalty</i>
<i>for going off the track.</i>

338
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,525
<i>You could not script this moment</i>

339
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:17,725
<i>if you sat down at the start</i>
<i>of the season and you tried it.</i>

340
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,045
<i>Ah, what a shame.</i>

341
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:29,845
<i> Carlos Sainz, at the moment,</i>
<i> is up into seventh place.</i>

342
00:22:29,925 --> 00:22:31,165
<i>When he comes into his pit-stop,</i>

343
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,045
<i>he'll have to stay stationary</i>
<i>for five seconds.</i>

344
00:22:34,485 --> 00:22:37,205
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>
<i>I was thinking,</i>

345
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:40,925
<i>"Why? Why? Why? Why?</i>
<i>And how is it possible?"</i>

346
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:47,325
<i>A five-second time penalty.</i>

347
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:49,205
<i>He'll serve it in his pit-stop.</i>

348
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:53,845
<i>This will cost him time and could cost him</i>
<i>and Renault an awful lot of points.</i>

349
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:57,085
<i> We were in a good position.</i>

350
00:22:58,965 --> 00:22:59,885
<i>Five seconds...</i>

351
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,405
<i>it feels like forever.</i>

352
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:07,805
<i> With Sainz held up in the pits,</i>

353
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:10,365
<i>Magnussen is able</i>
<i>to get ahead of him.</i>

354
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:13,605
Yes!

355
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:21,805
<i>The Haas driver is</i>
<i>giving it everything.</i>

356
00:23:24,405 --> 00:23:27,125
<i>And into the pits comes</i>
<i>the other Renault of Hülkenberg.</i>

357
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:30,325
<i> Standby, Nico.</i>

358
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:34,845
<i>Unbelievable.</i>
<i>What a turnaround for Haas.</i>

359
00:23:34,925 --> 00:23:37,445
<i>Magnussen has made it up to sixth place.</i>

360
00:23:37,525 --> 00:23:39,165
- Oh!
- Yes!

361
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:44,005
<i> Great job.</i>
<i>You are pulling away from Hülkenberg.</i>

362
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,645
<i>Magnussen is in front, right?</i>

363
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,725
<i>Magnussen is in front.</i>

364
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:56,005
<i>Now is the time to push</i>
<i>as hard as you can.</i>

365
00:23:56,605 --> 00:23:57,765
<i>Push like hell.</i>

366
00:23:58,325 --> 00:24:02,285
<i>The battle for best of the rest</i>
<i>has come down to these two drivers,</i>

367
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:04,325
<i>these two rivals,</i>

368
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:06,645
<i>these two men with everything to prove.</i>

369
00:24:08,725 --> 00:24:10,205
<i>Hülkenberg on a very good lap.</i>

370
00:24:10,285 --> 00:24:13,125
<i>Yeah. He's picking up the pace now.</i>

371
00:24:13,205 --> 00:24:14,285
<i>We're under threat.</i>

372
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:19,685
<i> Hülkenberg chasing down Magnussen.</i>
<i>This is a massive scrap.</i>

373
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:22,205
<i>They are both pushing</i>
<i>to the absolute limit.</i>

374
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:24,405
<i>Oh, no.</i>

375
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:27,285
<i>We've got a problem, Nico.</i>

376
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,965
<i>You are losing</i>
<i>a little bit of performance.</i>

377
00:24:29,605 --> 00:24:31,325
<i>So, look after the rear tires.</i>

378
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:33,485
<i> Annoying.</i>

379
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:35,925
<i>Right rear</i>
<i>is not looking very good.</i>

380
00:24:36,005 --> 00:24:40,085
<i>I think it's got some light blistering</i>
<i>in the middle of the right rear tire.</i>

381
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:41,885
<i>Fuck!</i>

382
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,965
<i>And Magnussen is starting to pull away.</i>

383
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,165
<i>- </i><i> Fuck.</i>
<i>-  Sorry, Nico.</i>

384
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:51,445
<i>The pace is slow.</i>

385
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,525
<i>All of a sudden, the car has problems.</i>

386
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:56,205
<i>You're like, "This can't be true."</i>

387
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:00,125
Some one thing was wrong
in a split second

388
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:03,445
and everything is, you know--
everything is suddenly much harder.

389
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,325
<i>Losing the rear more and more now.</i>

390
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:10,565
<i>Magnussen has boxed.</i>
<i>Magnussen has boxed.</i>

391
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,845
<i>Twenty seconds, 20 seconds.</i>

392
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:16,485
<i>So Magnussen</i>
<i>has been called in for his pit stop.</i>

393
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:23,245
<i>Hülkenberg has a chance</i>
<i>to regain his advantage.</i>

394
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:27,165
<i>Hülkenberg retakes the position,</i>

395
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:30,645
<i>but with the Renault's rear tire problems,</i>
<i>can he hold onto it?</i>

396
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:37,365
<i>We need to fight until the end.</i>
<i>Keep on pushing.</i>

397
00:25:38,725 --> 00:25:40,925
<i>You just have to focus on yourself.</i>

398
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:44,845
You know, our battle is probably gonna
go down to the last lap.

399
00:25:45,365 --> 00:25:47,165
<i>It's gonna go down to the very end.</i>

400
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:50,885
<i> Will Magnussen catch Hülkenberg?</i>

401
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:53,445
<i> How many laps to go?</i>

402
00:25:54,165 --> 00:25:55,805
<i> Eleven laps to go.</i>

403
00:25:58,405 --> 00:26:00,365
<i> Give me everything.</i>
<i>I need everything.</i>

404
00:26:02,245 --> 00:26:04,565
<i> A very dramatic final few laps.</i>

405
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:08,325
<i>Can Hülkenberg keep going on these tires?</i>

406
00:26:08,925 --> 00:26:10,285
<i> Seven laps to go, Nico.</i>

407
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:15,085
<i>Gap to Magnussen</i>
<i>behind you is 7.3.</i>

408
00:26:16,365 --> 00:26:19,445
<i>Oh! Locking up there.</i>
<i>Hülkenberg's in real trouble.</i>

409
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,445
<i> Tires are struggling.</i>

410
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:25,325
<i>Hang on, Nico.</i>

411
00:26:26,325 --> 00:26:29,005
<i>You know,</i>
<i> if you do a mistake, it's gonna hurt you.</i>

412
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:32,325
<i> You're doing a great job</i>
<i>in the circumstances, Nico.</i>

413
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,605
<i>Just need a few more laps,</i>
<i>you're doing a great job, mate.</i>

414
00:26:35,685 --> 00:26:37,245
<i>I think we're fucked.</i>

415
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:42,805
<i> You might be in front,</i>
<i>but you're burning through your tires.</i>

416
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:45,205
<i>And you can see,</i>
<i>you know, the defeat is coming.</i>

417
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:06,205
<i>You think about all these times</i>
<i>you have bad luck in your career.</i>

418
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:13,885
<i>I can't really lose much more.</i>

419
00:27:20,045 --> 00:27:21,605
<i>But fortunately...</i>

420
00:27:21,685 --> 00:27:22,925
not this time.

421
00:27:26,005 --> 00:27:26,845
Whoo!

422
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:31,165
<i>Hülkenberg crosses the line</i>
<i>ahead of Magnussen.</i>

423
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:33,925
<i>Somehow, he managed to hold on.</i>

424
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:36,365
<i>Absolutely brilliant, Nico.</i>

425
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:39,405
<i>That was beautifully judged there.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

426
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:41,285
<i>Thanks, mate.</i>

427
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:44,805
<i>The Renault</i>
<i>crosses the line in sixth.</i>

428
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:48,685
<i>Those points should be enough to ensure</i>
<i>Renault take fourth</i>

429
00:27:48,765 --> 00:27:51,325
<i>in the Constructor's Championship</i>
<i>this season.</i>

430
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,485
<i>Making Renault best of the rest.</i>

431
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:55,365
Wow! Thank you.

432
00:27:57,205 --> 00:27:58,645
How are you doing?

433
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,445
<i>You know, I needed that.</i>

434
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,965
You know, it was
really important for myself,

435
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:07,085
for my own confidence, you know,
and I just, like...

436
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:09,045
You feel free suddenly again, you know?

437
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,125
You got all that weight from your chest,
from your shoulders and...

438
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:14,965
a very great feeling.

439
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:21,565
What Hülkenberg did in Austin
really is a huge moment for Renault.

440
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:25,125
<i>Not only do they win</i>
<i>best of the rest for 2018,</i>

441
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,125
but they keep that dream alive

442
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,965
that they can and will be
world champions once again.

443
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:37,405
<i>Fucking hell.</i>

444
00:28:39,405 --> 00:28:40,925
<i>You know, it's embarrassing.</i>

445
00:28:41,005 --> 00:28:43,925
<i>During the last laps,</i>
<i>I thought it would be fine.</i>

446
00:28:44,005 --> 00:28:45,925
<i>But we've lost-- lost out.</i>

447
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:50,085
We just gotta, you know,
take that on our shoulders

448
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:52,285
and try and do better next year.

449
00:28:56,085 --> 00:28:57,765
<i>You know, I believe we can do better.</i>

450
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,085
Fuck. Fucking hell!

451
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,245
I'm afraid to get off the fucking pitwall.

452
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,405
Fucking hell.

453
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:19,965
<i> You sit there, like, beaten up</i>
<i>on your seat and just think,</i>

454
00:29:20,045 --> 00:29:23,845
<i>"How did we do this all wrong?</i>
<i>We should have done better."</i>

455
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:26,365
<i>Everybody in Haas wants to do better.</i>

456
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:31,645
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe it just wasn't our time.</i>

457
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:34,685
Thank you.

458
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:38,805
Do you think, next year,
you're gonna have more races like that?

459
00:29:38,885 --> 00:29:40,685
Well, of course.

460
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:43,125
We want to close the gap
to the top three teams.

461
00:29:43,205 --> 00:29:44,925
You know, it's, obviously, a challenge.

462
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:47,685
Of course, everybody
is working and pushing hard for that.

463
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:48,685
Thank you.

464
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:53,365
I think Nico, with his talents,

465
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:56,805
evidenced by his performance in Austin...

466
00:29:57,885 --> 00:30:00,445
<i>it shows that there is some things</i>
<i>that doesn't work right now</i>

467
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:01,485
<i>in Formula One.</i>

468
00:30:03,165 --> 00:30:07,405
<i>You can't have a driver like Nico</i>
<i>not on a podium.</i>

469
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,045
Thank you.

470
00:30:10,765 --> 00:30:12,845
<i>He's world champion material.</i>

471
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,285
<i>He deserves a car</i>
<i>that can match his skills.</i>

472
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:21,645
<i>And I just hope that one day</i>
<i>we can see that in action,</i>

473
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:25,005
<i>because he deserves it.</i>
