19
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,660
I followed Gordon Ramasy's recipe,

20
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,200
for the perfect scrambled eggs.

21
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,290
Thank you. This looks amazing.

22
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,250
Except I cut the tomatoes in half.

23
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,710
The recipe says to saute them whole,

24
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,380
but I once had a patient who almost choked to death on a...

25
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,470
Oh, my God.

26
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,810
These are perfect.

27
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,850
I'm glad you like your breakfast.

28
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,270
I read that if I made you feel loved and cared for,

29
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,770
it could help us work out your insecurity.

30
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,650
Over my friendship with Lea.

31
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,530
Shaun.

32
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,570
You don't have to do any more research.

33
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,410
I am fine with you and Lea being friends.

34
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,960
But you can keep making me eggs anytime you want.

35
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,010
You're late.

36
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,560
I made Carly a special breakfast this morning.

37
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,600
And then she wanted to have sex.

38
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,190
So we did.

39
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,400
That's great, Shaun.

40
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,820
Next time, feel free just to say you missed the bus.

41
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,610
Women don't like it when you kiss and tell.

42
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,280
Even though they do it all the time.

43
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,610
Not at work.

44
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,160
Apparently, you've never been in the nurses' break room.

45
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,120
What were you doing in there?

46
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,540
Delivering the donuts.

47
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,040
Best lesson I learned as a cop,

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,960
better to feed down than kiss up.

49
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,090
It's my fault we haven't started our rounds.

50
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,760
I missed the bus.

51
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,630
It's all right.

52
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,640
I'm glad you're all here.

53
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,310
Because I want to apologize.

54
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,730
Dr. Lim told me she received a complaint

55
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,400
about me playing favorites.

56
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,650
She obviously didn't reveal any names,

57
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,530
but I want to assure you all

58
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,450
that I don't have any favorites.

59
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,660
And if I did anything to give that impression,

60
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,290
it's my mistake.

61
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,740
It won't happen again.

62
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,620
We're a team.

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,540
And we need to be able to communicate

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,790
and trust each other in order to be our best.

65
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,590
So in the future, if you have any concerns,

66
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,670
you can come to me directly.

67
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,260
Absolutely.

68
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,640
She got blindsided, never saw it coming.

69
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,020
Thank God a woman driving by had pepper spray in her purse,

70
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,100
or the dog would've killed her.

71
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,150
- Brave woman. - Loosen the tourniquet.

72
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,650
Okay.

73
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,900
We need an OR stat. Page Dr. Melendez.

74
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,610
Right away, Doctor.

75
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,910
And start empiric antibiotics.

76
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm gonna guess this dog wasn't big on flossing.

77
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,450
On it.

78
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,370
Wasn't that funny.

79
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,410
Donuts. Best 10 bucks you'll ever spend.

82
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,800
Cory's upper trachea never fully developed in the womb.

83
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,720
His upper airway is totally blocked,

84
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
and he has no larynx at all.

85
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,230
The trach tube he needs to breathe

86
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,480
continues to cause reoccurring infections and pneumonias.

87
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,490
He says it tickles when you touch his neck.

88
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,450
Sorry.

89
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,780
Not much I can do about that,

90
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,160
but I'll try to make it quick.

91
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,870
Why are you signing?

92
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,450
He's mute, but he's not deaf.

93
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,250
It helps us stay mindful of what he's going through.

94
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,250
What did he say?

95
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,340
He says when we get mad, we don't sign... We yell.

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,430
And when we play soccer together.

97
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,510
So keep your room clean

98
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,510
and pass your dad the ball every once in a while,

99
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,970
and then they won't have to yell.

100
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,390
The good news is his lungs are clear

101
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,100
and I don't see any sign of infection.

102
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,020
- Thank God. - The better news is

103
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,650
he's a good candidate for the surgery we discussed.

104
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,070
Yes, it seems a bit experimental.

105
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,110
It's shown great results.

106
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,280
If we can excise the scar tissue and open up the airway,

107
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,030
he still won't be able to talk,

108
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,370
but he'll finally be able to breathe normally.

109
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,500
It's a complicated procedure,

110
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,460
but given the severity of the infections he's been dealing with,

111
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,590
I think it's definitely the best option.

112
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,130
He says he'll do anything

113
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,550
to get rid of the tube sticking out of his neck.

114
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,600
And you two?

115
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,400
Okay, now you're the one yelling. We hear you.

116
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,240
What do you think?

117
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,120
Let's do it.

118
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,390
Fran?

119
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,040
Fran, I'm Dr. Melendez.

120
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,250
This is Doctors Park and Browne.

121
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,800
You were attacked by a dog, almost bled to death.

122
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
You remember?

123
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,180
Yes.

124
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,470
We had to repair a severed artery in your arm.

125
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,310
So, am I okay now?

126
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,810
The surgery went well.

127
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,770
Dr. Park.

128
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,150
We were able to stop the bleeding,

129
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,860
which had caused you to go into shock.

130
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,520
But we still need to go back in,

131
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,940
stabilize the shattered bone, repair nerve damage,

132
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,660
and do skin and tissue grafts.

133
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,570
But after that?

134
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
I'm a firefighter. I need my full strength.

135
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,040
With plenty of physical therapy,

136
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,630
we should be able to get you pretty close.

137
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,640
It must be hard for him to communicate.

138
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
My friend's 12-year-old daughter

139
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,350
took a signing class at summer camp.

140
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,680
She picked it up pretty fast.

141
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,020
Non-verbal communication is definitely more confusing.

142
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,360
That's why Carly and I always talk out our problems.

143
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,480
Sorry to break it to you, Murphy,

144
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,360
but it doesn't matter how explicitly Carly speaks.

145
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
She's saying a lot more silently.

146
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,990
And it's often the opposite of what she said out loud.

147
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:22,540
Why would Carly lie?

148
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,790
It's not lying.

149
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,750
It's communicating indirectly.

150
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,670
Everyone does it, but women way more than men.

151
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,340
Most of the time, we don't realize it.

152
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,840
That sounds sexist.

153
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,180
You gonna report me to HR or listen and learn?

154
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,220
Has she ever told you that she didn't want to have sex

155
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,560
because she had a headache?

156
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,850
No.

157
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,100
And I thought you didn't want to hear about my sex life.

158
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,310
Fine.

159
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,810
But if you ever get the feeling she's upset about something

160
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,730
and she insists nothing's wrong,

161
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,280
something's wrong.

162
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,030
Humerus isn't broken.

163
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,620
It's...pulverized.

164
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,210
Who do you think complained to Lim?

165
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,830
No idea.

166
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,670
And we're gonna need internal fixation

167
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,130
with locked intramedullary nailing

168
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,840
to stabilize the fractured pieces.

169
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,170
It must be Morgan.

170
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,340
She's always looking for a competitive advantage.

171
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,720
Let's focus on the patient.

172
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
You can start your whistleblower investigation

173
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,930
as soon as we're done.

174
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,050
How does she expect us to trust her

175
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,810
if whenever something doesn't go her way,

176
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,810
she just goes to the boss...

177
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,190
It wasn't Morgan.

178
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,440
It was me.

179
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,190
Why?

180
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,570
You're the least competitive of all of us.

181
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,690
That's not true, and I didn't do it to help me,

182
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,070
I did it to help you.

183
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,780
If people see you're getting special treatment,

184
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,280
even if it's not your fault, they'll resent you.

185
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,250
I'm not getting special treatment.

186
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,580
And I don't need your protection.

187
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,880
Fine. My mistake.

188
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,630
So you can yell at me

189
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,720
or we can get back to work.

190
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,850
Just what the doctor ordered.

191
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,220
- W-w-what? - You.

192
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,400
I need a double dose of Shaunie, stat.

193
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,690
Glassy is driving me crazy.

194
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,730
What is it with old people and technology?

195
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,190
Don't worry. I just need to vent for a minute.

196
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:19,030
And I'll scram if Carly comes.

197
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,950
It's okay.

198
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,700
I think Carly's not insecure about you anymore.

199
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,750
Really? That's awesome.

200
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,330
I added the "I think"

201
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,420
because Morgan thinks

202
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,880
women sometimes say the opposite of what they think.

203
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,420
But I don't think Carly would hide what she thinks.

204
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,220
What do you think?

205
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,020
Nobody always says what they think.

206
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,930
So...

207
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,730
Morgan's right?

208
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,270
Except for the sexist part?

209
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,190
No.

210
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,110
I think Carly is very in tune to how you communicate.

211
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,990
If she was unhappy, I'm sure she wouldn't hide it.

212
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,910
Yes. I agree.

213
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,080
Lunch is over. We have a surgery to do.

214
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,160
Morgan. Love your boots.

215
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,000
Thanks. Love your sweater.

216
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,290
Thanks.

217
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,180
Nice work.

218
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,430
Look at that. On the bone.

219
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,310
Teeth marks.

220
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,470
Must've been a huge dog.

221
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,770
During "no knock" searches,

222
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,100
I was more afraid of dogs than guns.

223
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,560
Gangsters have horrible aim,

224
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,230
but their dogs never miss the target...

225
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,650
Which was our crotches.

226
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,860
Damn. How many times they get ahold of you?

227
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,410
Never. Another benefit of martial arts training.

228
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,070
You kicked the dogs?

229
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,370
Like I needed a 60-yard field goal to win the Super Bowl.

230
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,660
That's awful.

231
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,000
It's self-defense.

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,960
Totally.

233
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,000
I need 9-0 nylon microsutures.

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,010
Next step is to suture in the interposition graft.

235
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,050
Dr. Park's doing great. Might as well continue.

236
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,380
I... I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty.

237
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,140
Let's see how Park does with this first.

238
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,600
Make sure your stay sutures are at six and twelve o'clock.

239
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,530
You are very efficient.

240
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,660
And you're very clever,

241
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,450
introing your insult with a compliment.

242
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,990
Your "helping me out"

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,450
appears to have conveniently helped you out.

244
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,790
I was expecting worse.

245
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,330
Melendez is bending over backwards to avoid anything

246
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,960
that might convey the slightest bit of appreciation for my work.

247
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,250
Because it couldn't possibly be

248
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,960
that I was actually doing a better job than you.

249
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,630
Right. You're probably buying him donuts, too.

250
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,590
I did what I thought needed to be done,

251
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,760
and you're accomplishing nothing

252
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,970
by continuing to badger me about it.

253
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:52,600
Thanks, Dad.

254
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,930
You're welcome, child.

255
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,810
The boy's obstructed cricotracheal segment

256
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,440
looks bigger than what we saw on imaging.

257
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,530
I chose to be aggressive with resection.

258
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,070
Murphy, flex the neck to mobilize the ends

259
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,280
and reduce tension on the anastomosis.

260
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,780
Are you sure we're gonna be able to cinch it closed?

261
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,160
Not "we." You.

262
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,250
Step on up.

263
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,500
Four-o vicryl sutures on a needle driver.

264
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,750
Place lateral traction sutures

265
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,670
at the proximal and distal airway.

266
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,310
- You all right? - Yeah, it's just,

267
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,720
I... I hit my finger with a hammer last night.

268
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,480
I was trying to hang a painting.

269
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,600
Murphy, take over.

270
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,350
It's all right. I can...

271
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,270
Move. You're a surgeon, not a hockey player.

272
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,110
We don't play through our injuries.

273
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,320
Next time, hire a handyman.

274
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,040
Those fingers are your livelihood.

275
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,370
Got it.

276
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,960
I know Carly says she's not jealous anymore,

277
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,840
but based on what I saw at lunch,

278
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,630
I'm thinking maybe she should be.

279
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,720
I think Murphy's old enough

280
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,800
to handle his own girlfriend trouble.

281
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,140
I don't have any girlfriend trouble.

282
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,350
That "eating off the plate" move

283
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,060
is the oldest trick in the book.

284
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,730
Lea was hungry.

285
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,640
It looked more like she was claiming territory

286
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,060
than satisfying hunger.

287
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,820
She might as well have peed on your leg.

288
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,650
You, shut up.

289
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,280
And you, keep a smaller gap between the sutures.

290
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,530
We're gonna need a solid anchor

291
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,620
to get the anastomosis airtight.

292
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,580
That's better. Good job.

293
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,250
- Good work today. - Thanks.

294
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,540
See you tomorrow at the track.

295
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,340
I, uh...

296
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,430
I... I wanted to talk to you about that.

297
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,760
We can't do this anymore.

298
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,640
It's just a run on a public track.

299
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,480
It's not like we're meeting at a hotel.

300
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,980
I just shouldn't be socializing with residents outside of work.

301
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,060
Any of you.

302
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,020
Neil.

303
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,110
I've been going through a tough time.

304
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,690
Our friendship, having someone I can talk to,

305
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,700
it helps.

306
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,570
I'm not abandoning you.

307
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,200
I'll be there to support you at work.

308
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,080
You've got your therapist. You're gonna be fine.

309
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,660
This is exactly why women have such a hard time finding mentors.

310
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,960
No one questions when guys hang out,

311
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,420
but anytime a woman wants to build

312
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,000
a totally appropriate relationship with a male colleague,

313
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,670
the stupid rumors start.

314
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,680
I agree.

315
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,090
But the rumors have started.

316
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,320
I'm gonna plug the trach tube,

317
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
and I want you to try to take a breath.

318
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,280
Nice and easy.

319
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,510
He says it hurts,

320
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,850
but it's the best feeling he's ever had.

321
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,900
What's wrong?

322
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,820
You don't like it?

323
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,570
It's delicious.

324
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,990
I hear delicious, but I see disappointed.

325
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,910
It's not the chicken.

326
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,630
It's my patient.

327
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,040
We fixed his airway,

328
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,090
and he can breathe without the trach now.

329
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,050
That's fantastic.

330
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,880
But he still can't talk.

331
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,340
He can talk. He just does it with his hands.

332
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,100
But only with people who can also sign,

333
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,770
and they have to be looking at him, and...

334
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,020
Well, could you do a cadaveric larynx transplant?

335
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,640
No.

336
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,100
I've heard that's worked for some throat cancer patients.

337
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,310
No, Dr. Lim ruled that out years ago.

338
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,980
The risk of tissue rejection

339
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,780
is too great in a child his age.

340
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,440
Well, could you wait till he's older?

341
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,280
No!

342
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,950
If he doesn't learn to speak soon,

343
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,870
he'll never be able to.

344
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,830
Okay.

345
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,340
I need to do some reading.

346
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,300
Come on, Shaun.

347
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,050
You should at least eat something first.

348
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,800
No.

349
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,470
I'm hungry,

350
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,180
but I will do the reading first.

351
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,690
You're in early.

352
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,610
What's the haps?

353
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,030
Are you serious?

354
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,900
I didn't even know

355
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,530
Michelle Obama was in SEAL Team Six.

356
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,120
Have you ever noticed how Glassy grinds his teeth

357
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,740
when he's listening to someone talk?

358
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,200
It's like a cow chewing on...

359
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,910
You never used to do that.

360
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,120
Do what?

361
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,420
Eat food off my plate.

362
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,500
I used to work full time at a place with private chefs.

363
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,170
Now I work part time in a place

364
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,260
with hard-boiled eggs in a vending machine.

365
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,180
She said it's like you're peeing on my leg.

366
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,350
You're gonna have to expand on that.

367
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,850
Morgan thinks your body language says

368
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,850
you're trying to assert your dominance over Carly.

369
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,940
Morgan is one twisted biatch.

370
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,230
Is she right?

371
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,360
No.

372
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,980
Not even close.

373
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,940
I promise you my voice and body language

374
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,860
are communicating the same thing,

375
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,580
which is pure, non-threatening, platonic friendship.

376
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,210
Shaun?

377
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,040
He also snores.

378
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,540
Really loud.

379
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,550
Glassman?

380
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,630
I have to go!

381
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,060
Okay.

382
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,360
Incision sites look good.

383
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,740
And skin and tissue grafts appear to be taking hold nicely.

384
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,490
We were able to reattach your bicep muscle and tendon.

385
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,370
That's good to hear.

386
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,610
Can you lift your arm?

387
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,710
No. I... I can't.

388
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,960
Because it hurts too much?

389
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,420
It doesn't hurt at all.

390
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,050
I figured that was because of the pain meds.

391
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,890
You feel that?

392
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,180
No.

393
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,110
Vocal cords aren't the only way

394
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,780
a person can create sounds with their mouth.

395
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,200
You want the kid to learn

396
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,620
to burp his way through his conversation?

397
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,990
I don't think it would be possible

398
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,620
to sustain enough air output to...

399
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,290
It was a joke, Murphy.

400
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:00,790
Snoring is a better model anyway.

401
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,630
Soft palate tissue is what vibrates,

402
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,880
making the sound when people snore,

403
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,340
but it's not stiff enough to replace the vocal cords.

404
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,090
But we could use his own costal cartilage

405
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,100
to act as vocal cords.

406
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,220
The larynx is a complicated piece of anatomy.

407
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,060
Basically, a tiny musical instrument.

408
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,110
We can remove two of his ribs

409
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,860
to create the anterior and posterior larynx frame

410
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,400
and then stretch the cartilage across it.

411
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
And then cut open a trachea we worked so hard to close?

412
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,080
We could destroy everything we just fixed.

413
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,080
Yes.

414
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,580
I think it's worth the risk.

415
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,000
Because you're thinking the kid's like you,

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,880
that he needs to speak out loud to be understood.

417
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,050
She's right.

418
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,840
The larynx is like a musical instrument.

419
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,010
But if Bo Diddley can make a guitar out of a cigar box,

420
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:55,180
I'm pretty sure I can make a larynx from bone and cartilage.

421
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,400
Absolutely not. He's finally healthy.

422
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,730
There's no need to take any more risks.

423
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,320
You're right. There are definitely risks.

424
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,450
But I wouldn't present the option

425
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,030
if I didn't think we could manage them.

426
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,030
Couldn't we just wait until he's a few years older?

427
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,280
I assume the stronger he is, the safer it is.

428
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,040
Most verbal language development happens

429
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,200
within the first eight years of a child's life.

430
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,920
Cory's already 10.

431
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,040
It we wait any longer,

432
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,580
he may not be able to learn to speak,

433
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,750
even with a larynx.

434
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,460
He can communicate without speaking.

435
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,260
You're making a big mistake.

436
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,140
Murphy.

437
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,680
He'll always be... limited.

438
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,970
It'll be difficult to make friends,

439
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,720
to interact with strangers.

440
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,690
Murphy. That's enough.

441
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,060
They're aware of their options,

442
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,940
and they've made their decision.

443
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,070
The suture repair looks fine.

444
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,280
Which makes me think the nerve here got compressed

445
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,230
between the bone and the dog's teeth.

446
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,650
It's too wide a span to repair with a graft.

447
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,410
What if we built a nerve conduit

448
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,290
out of silicone and polyglycolide?

449
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,880
We could use it to guide the severed nerve ends

450
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,960
to grow toward each other,

451
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,840
create a pathway for them to connect and heal.

452
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,420
I'm not sure the nerves can grow across that distance.

453
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,720
It's definitely worth a try.

454
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,370
We can't just experiment on her, like a lab rat.

455
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,140
And we can't just sit back and do nothing.

456
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,180
I'm not saying we should do nothing.

457
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,260
I'm just saying we can't experiment on her blindly.

458
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,310
Maybe we could use donor tissue to bridge the gap.

459
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,640
Well, that means putting the patient on a transplant list.

460
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,730
Who knows how long it would take

461
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,230
before she gets a viable donation?

462
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,670
The firehouse won't hold her position until she heals.

463
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
She'd lose her job.

464
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,150
Well, first, you want to treat her like a guinea pig,

465
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,610
and now you're deeply concerned about her life experience.

466
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,470
- You just want to be right. - And you don't?

467
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,770
Are you gonna step in at any point?

468
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,980
I think Park's idea has the best chance of success.

469
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,990
Get her prepped.

470
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,850
Did you really think his idea is better,

471
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,760
or do you just not want to look like

472
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,330
you're biased toward me?

473
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,600
I'm not happy about this situation either,

474
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,510
but I think you're overreacting.

475
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,230
You better get it under control,

476
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,760
or you're gonna find yourself watching from the gallery.

477
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,130
Do you have a problem with me staying friends with Shaun?

478
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,920
I know you've told him you're fine with it, but are you?

479
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,470
Yes.

480
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,720
Really?

481
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:04,050
I mean, I'm totally glad you are.

482
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,510
It's great.

483
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,770
But I'm not sure I would be if I were in your shoes.

484
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,980
If it was any other guy, I probably wouldn't be.

485
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,900
But Shaun, he always tells the truth.

486
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,380
So when he told me that he's not interested in you,

487
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,400
I believe him.

488
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,700
Okay.

489
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,210
You told the residents not to come to me?

490
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,270
No. That's not at all what I said.

491
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,800
You didn't tell them,

492
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,510
"Next time you have a problem, come to me directly"?

493
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,600
I was encouraging open communication and trust on my team.

494
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,410
What I have is a group of ambitious young residents

495
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,570
who are struggling to figure out

496
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,940
how to be cooperative as well as competitive.

497
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,080
You're not helping them figure it out

498
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,960
by suggesting they resist taking complaints

499
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,400
up the chain of command.

500
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,380
I'm sorry you've had to waste your time dealing with this,

501
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,460
but there really isn't...

502
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,050
Neil, I am not wasting my time.

503
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,830
You do have an issue.

504
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,540
And you've got to stop pretending you don't.

505
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,630
The incision is healing nicely.

506
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,960
We should be able to discharge you today.

507
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,970
Are you happy to be going home?

508
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,270
Do you have any questions for us?

509
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,400
Are you sure?

510
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,440
Because you don't really seem all that happy to be going home.

511
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,350
What is he saying?

512
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,860
He said Dr. Murphy was right.

513
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,950
He does have a hard time talking to kids at school.

514
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,450
And making friends.

515
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,180
He doesn't want people to ignore him

516
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,880
or act like he's stupid anymore.

517
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,000
Honey, I'm so sorry.

518
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,310
Okay.

Reznick, I need you to secure the posterior surface

540
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,550
while I place PDS four-o sutures.

541
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,890
Murphy, be ready to suture the graft into the anterior section.

542
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,730
Morgan realized our patient wasn't happy,

543
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,900
even though he said he was.

544
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,000
If she hadn't been there,

545
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,280
we wouldn't be doing this surgery.

546
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,410
It wouldn't have mattered what I was able to realize

547
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,970
if you hadn't been so obsessed

548
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,420
about finding a new surgery to help the patient.

549
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:31,650
Blood pressure's plummeting.

550
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,130
The field is filling with blood.

551
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,130
I can't see the source.

552
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,240
Murphy, expose the external carotid

553
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,010
and find the superior thyroid.

554
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,610
BP still dropping.

555
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,490
Heart rate is up.

556
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,350
Place a temporary clamp on it, Reznick.

557
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,150
It's not working. This is venous.

558
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,070
10 blade.

559
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,010
I see what happened.

560
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,630
Left and right jugular veins are connected by a venous arc

561
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,950
we injured during retraction.

562
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,800
Dr. Murphy, just double ligate

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,140
with two-oh silk ties on both ends.

564

Silk ties.

565

He's stabilizing.

566
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,640
Good job.

567
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:25,980
Both of you.

568
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,190
Congratulations.

569
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,700

They should get a room.

00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,750
I have an early morning.

666
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,380
Okay.

667
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,960
I will see you at work.

668
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,660
You're at 60 meters per second.

669
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,140
Normal electrical signal velocity of the nerve is 50-65.

670
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,500
That's...good?

671
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,290
Very. The surgery worked.

672
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,420
Your strength might go down a bit,

673
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,900
but you definitely should get function back.

674
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,700
How can I thank you? Seriously.

675
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,430
Well, actually, uh, it's Dr. Melendez you should thank.

676
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,340
He did the surgery.

677
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,740
We didn't really do anything.

678
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,210
Well, you obviously did something.

679
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,210
Okay. You're welcome.

680
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,210
Get some rest.

681
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,050
How are you feeling?

682
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,720
Any pain or discomfort?

683
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,470
Good.

684
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,860
If you're feeling up to it,

685
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,560
we'd like you to try to make a sound.

686
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,860
Now, start down here and just push the air up.

687
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,480
Be gentle.

688
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,190
We don't need you breaking any wine glasses just yet.

689
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,920
That's the most beautiful voice I've ever heard.

690
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,900
It's just a primitive sound.

691
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,010
With speech therapy, he'll be able to fully speak.

692
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,720
Cory says thank you, Dr. Murphy,

693
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,430
for pushing for the surgery.

694
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,900
This is the best day of his life.

695
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,070
You are very welcome.

696
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,720
This is not you.

697
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,510
And it's not right.

698
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,200
We can be friends and have it not be weird.

699
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,600
It's already weird.

700
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,530
I'm not gonna stay.

701
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,240
Well, you don't have to run away just because I'm here.

702
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,500
I'm not running. I'm being professional.

703
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,080
You're overcompensating.

704
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,150
Trying to play it safe.

705
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,670
And it's... it's hurting things.

706
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,650
It got Park and I in an argument.

707
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,990
That's not how I want to be mentored.

708
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,930
That's not who you are.

709
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,620
At least, it's not who I thought you were.

710
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,830
Enjoy your dinner.

711
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,870
I'm confused.

712
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,390
One day, you're filing a complaint about your boss.

713
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,060
The next, you're being incredibly nice and supportive

714
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,460
to your fellow resident.

715
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,440
I told you, I just felt like Dr. Melendez's treatment of Browne

716
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,420
was starting to cause dissension on the team.

717
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,740
I have no doubt that's part of the truth.

718
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,510
I'm guessing the other part was...

719
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,470
preemptive.

720
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,140
You thought it would inoculate you.

721
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,740
We'd never be able to fire someone

722
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,480
who filed a formal complaint against their attending.

723
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,230
Which is why I'm so confused.

724
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,030
Why would you feel like your job could be in jeopardy?

725
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,190
I don't.

726
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

727
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,120
Okay.

728
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,660
Just so you're clear...

729
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,800
I won't hesitate to let you or anyone else go

730
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,140
if I feel it's deserved.

731
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,540
No matter whether they've filed a complaint or not.

732
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,290
Of course.

733
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,880
I understand that.

734
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,050
Good.

735
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:16,800
Have a good night.

736
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,730
Thanks.

737
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,450
Two menus.

738
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,310
I'm going to make you a surprise dinner tonight.

739
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,910
It's a special grilled cheese sandwich.

740
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,290
It's special because it uses four kinds of cheeses...

741
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,340
Gruyere, Parmesan, yellow...

742
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,570
I don't think that we should be together anymore.

743
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,330
I can't be your girlfriend anymore.

744
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,420
Did...

745
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,820
did I do something wrong?

746
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,680
No, Shaun. It's not...

747
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,310
Last night at karaoke,

748
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,980
when you and Lea were singing together,

749
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:01,570
there was something between you two.

750
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,620
You love her, not me.

751
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,790
No. N-no.

752
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,550
No.

753
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,100
No.

754
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,320
I don't.

755
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,490
It's obvious.

756
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,600
You're wrong.

757
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,150
You say that.

758
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,190
And maybe you even believe it.

759
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,940
But...

760
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,320
I saw what I saw, Shaun, and I am telling you,

761
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,950
it doesn't matter what you say.

762
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,950
It's true.

763
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,170
And I think she loves you, too.
