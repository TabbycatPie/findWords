1
00:00:02,582 --> 00:00:04,072
Kids, everyone has an opinion

2
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:06,243
on how long it takes
to recover from a breakup.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,517
Half the length of the relationship.

4
00:00:08,688 --> 00:00:10,519
One week for every month
you were together.

5
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:13,817
Exactly 10,000 drinks.
However long that takes.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,554
You can't measure
something like this in time.

7
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:18,392
There's a series of steps.

8
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:21,990
From her bed to the front door.
Bam! Out of there. Next!

9
00:00:22,903 --> 00:00:25,497
<i>But I think you start to recover
the moment you meet that person</i>

10
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:27,869
<i>who gets you back in the game.</i>

11
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:31,509
<i>This is the story of how I met that person.</i>

12
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:43,413
<i>Now, kids, if you want to go swimming,
you don't just dive in.</i>

13
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:45,957
<i>First, you dip your toe in the water.</i>

14
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:48,459
- Hey.
- Hi.

15
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:59,137
<i>You check the temperature.
See how it feels.</i>

16
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:03,236
- I'm Ted.
- Vicky.

17
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,063
<i>And then you slowly wade in.</i>

18
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:35,937
I got left at the altar a month ago.

19
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:37,339
<i>Or, you know, cannonball.</i>

20
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:40,379
It was a complete disaster,
and ever since then,

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,643
I haven't been able to even look
at another woman.

22
00:01:43,783 --> 00:01:47,310
Except for the old lady on the subway
who breakdances for nickels.

23
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,888
I don't look at her that way.
I just look at her.

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,517
I mean, it's an old lady breakdancing.
And she is good.

25
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:57,192
I'm going to give her a dollar next time.

26
00:01:57,764 --> 00:02:00,324
Hey, let's pretend I just said this.

27
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:03,129
These elevator rides
have been the highlight of my week,

28
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:06,069
and I'd love to see you again Friday night.

29
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:10,371
Not in the elevator.
At a restaurant, a nice one.

30
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:14,573
- What do you say?
- Yes.

31
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:31,097
<i>Kids,
I walked in on a lot of crazy stuff</i>

32
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:33,098
<i>at the old apartment over the years.</i>

33
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:39,535
Sorry, guys.
I'm just going to go with a bowl of fruit.

34
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,067
It's been 12 minutes!

35
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,715
- Drop it!
- You first!

36
00:02:49,816 --> 00:02:51,215
Ike, why are you pointing your gun at me?

37
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,310
- Don't use my name!
- Put the guns down, now!

38
00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:01,952
<i>But one of the craziest things
I ever walked in on</i>

39
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:05,429
<i>happened when I was roommates
with your Aunt Robin.</i>

40
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,063
- Hey.
- Hey.

41
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,975
- Who are you?
- Mitch.

42
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,415
- What are you doing, Mitch?
- You must be the roommate.

43
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:27,043
I'm on a date with Robin.
She had to step outside to take a call.

44
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,643
I guess her cell phone
doesn't work in here.

45
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:29,779
Oh.

46
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:31,918
Oh!

47
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:35,517
Oh.
Robin didn't use the super-secret signal.

48
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:38,257
We put this old takeout menu
on the doorknob.

49
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:41,562
Place went out of business. Mr. Wang's.

50
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:44,762
Guess I don't have to explain
why that's funny.

51
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:46,304
I'm gonna go.

52
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:53,535
When you leave, take the seat cushion
with you. That's trash now.

53
00:03:54,347 --> 00:03:57,145
I think that I am more
than qualified for the job.

54
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,687
My weaknesses? I would say
caring too much, working too hard,

55
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:03,949
and putting my career
in front of my love life.

56
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,992
Whoops!
That last one was real. What?

57
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:14,095
Well, it appears our sweet, innocent
little Robin has taken a lover.

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,464
A young blade by the name of Mitch.

59
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,727
Her blind date? Total bust.

60
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:21,068
She's been sending me text messages
all night.

61
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:24,837
She just let him go upstairs
to use the bathroom a second ago.

62
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:26,809
Excuse me a minute.

63
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,044
Buddy, you are killing me. I'm kind of
in the middle of something here.

64
00:04:33,153 --> 00:04:34,211
Middle of what?

65
00:04:35,822 --> 00:04:39,417
This is my move.
It's called The Naked Man.

66
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:42,086
- The Naked Man?
- Goes like this.

67
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,925
You're on a first date,
you've had a few drinks.

68
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:47,793
<i>You make an excuse
to go up to the girl's apartment.</i>

69
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,368
- So the bathroom's right there.
- Okay, thanks.

70
00:04:51,204 --> 00:04:52,171
You know what, I'm gonna grab this.

71
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:54,433
- Okay.
- Hello?

72
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:59,638
<i>Then, once she leaves the room,
you strip down naked and wait.</i>

73
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:03,238
<i>When she comes back, she laughs.</i>

74
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,818
<i>She's so charmed
by your confidence and bravado,</i>

75
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,080
<i>she sleeps with you. Boom!</i>

76
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:13,682
- There is no way that works!
- Two out of three times.

77
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,419
Two out of three times?

78
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:19,019
Two out of three times.
You just have to pick your spot.

79
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:21,827
The Naked Man is best used
as a last resort,

80
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,993
kind of a Hail Mary on a first date

81
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:25,968
when you know there's not
going to be a second one.

82
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:27,698
How do you know
there's not gonna be a second date?

83
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:30,639
- Ted, look at me.
- I'd rather not, Mitch.

84
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:35,737
Robin is way out of my league.
I'm not smart, funny or handsome.

85
00:05:35,848 --> 00:05:37,679
And as you can plainly see,
there's nothing impressive

86
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:40,047
going on anywhere around here.

87
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:43,986
My only shot with a girl like Robin
is the element of surprise.

88
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:48,583
And, let's be honest, a little pity.
It's shock and...

89
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:49,661
Aw!

90
00:05:50,996 --> 00:05:56,093
- This doesn't really work.
- Two out of three times. Guaranteed.

91
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:59,568
- No way.
- Two out of three times.

92
00:05:59,671 --> 00:06:02,367
- He guaranteed it.
- Oh, come on.

93
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:04,442
There is no way
that's gonna work on Robin.

94
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,635
She's going to walk in there,

95
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,609
take one look at that idiot
and send him packing.

96
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:09,613
Yeah,
she might kick his ass first.

97
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,512
Yeah, she might get her gun
and shoot him.

98
00:06:17,156 --> 00:06:18,145
Go, go!

99
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:23,089
- My God!
- It worked.

100
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:25,459
Mr. Wang's is back in business?

101
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:33,335
The Naked Man works!

102
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,567
This is gonna revolutionize
the one-night stand.

103
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:41,442
This is like the forward pass in football.
The slam dunk in basketball.

104
00:06:41,547 --> 00:06:43,947
The haircutting technique
where they hold it between their fingers

105
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:46,643
and cut right above it.
It's a total game-changer!

106
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:50,415
Barney, this guy slept with Robin,
who you claim to be in love with.

107
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,786
How can you be excited about this?

108
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:57,794
Lily, The Naked Man
is bigger than me and Robin.

109
00:06:57,896 --> 00:07:01,263
All these years,
I have been busting my hump,

110
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:05,632
with my secret identities
and my tricks and my gadgets.

111
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:10,231
I mean, I'm like Batman.
But this Mitch fellow, he's Superman.

112
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,537
He just rips off his clothes
and he's good to go.

113
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:15,772
What kind of gadgets
are we talking about?

114
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:18,211
So this is what it's gonna be like,
us living together?

115
00:07:18,317 --> 00:07:22,219
I come home, and guys you're dating are
just gonna be sitting on the couch, naked?

116
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:23,652
I wish I could say no.

117
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:27,919
I still cannot believe
The Naked Man worked on you.

118
00:07:28,026 --> 00:07:31,826
What can I say?
Okay, I went in there, and he was naked.

119
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:35,832
It was funny. I laughed, he laughed.

120
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:39,131
And then it just kind of happened.
I don't know.

121
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,700
I call slut!

122
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:44,241
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

123
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:45,605
Excuse me?

124
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:47,542
I'm sorry, Robin,
but you hooking up with this guy

125
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:51,582
makes it seem like the only thing
standing between you and sex is clothes.

126
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:55,510
I didn't just sleep with Mitch
because he was naked.

127
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:58,089
- Then why did you sleep with him?
- Because he...

128
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,157
Um...

129
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:05,453
He... Because I care about Mitch. A lot.

130
00:08:05,564 --> 00:08:10,297
There was a connection of specialness.

131
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:12,893
Of specialness and feelings.

132
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:16,769
It was because he was naked.
And I'm sorry, but I don't approve.

133
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:21,312
There is only one reason to sleep
with somebody, and that is love.

134
00:08:23,782 --> 00:08:26,615
Yeah, Marshall's a big girl
because he believes in true love

135
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,049
<i>and just finished reading The Notebook</i>

136
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:30,519
because the secretaries bullied him
into joining Oprah's Book Club.

137
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:32,647
Fine! But you know I'm right.

138
00:08:32,758 --> 00:08:36,387
Marshall, I love you,
but there's lots of reasons to have sex.

139
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:38,122
- Name one.
- I can name 50.

140
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,927
- No, you can't.
- Number 1, last Thursday.

141
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:51,042
- Hey, Marshall, want to do it?
- I'm up.

142
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:56,708
You befouled our marital bed
because you couldn't get to sleep?

143
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:57,907
You're the one who said,

144
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:02,680
"That shadow on the ceiling looks like
a scary, toothless clown. Good night, Lily. "

145
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:07,487
- Fine! That's one. But I defy you to name...
- I'm going to name 50.

146
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:11,154
There's make-up sex, break-up sex,

147
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:14,357
and your-friend-just-told-you
- about-a-new-position sex.

148
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,457
You're welcome.

149
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:20,971
There's also revenge,
rebound, paratrooping.

150
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,172
You know, when you go out of town,
but instead of getting a hotel room,

151
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:26,870
you go straight to a bar with the
sole intention of hooking up with a girl

152
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:28,037
so you have a place to stay?

153
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:30,979
- Oh, you mean banging-for-roof.
- Slut!

154
00:09:31,717 --> 00:09:33,878
I don't do it. My college roommate did it.

155
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:36,250
Oh. No, no, Robin, I just have a bad cough.

156
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,323
I don't really
have a bad cough.

157
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:41,824
We all know college roommate
means you, slut!

158
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:45,655
Does anyone have a lozenge?

159
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:49,191
I've got one.
Nothing-good-on-television sex.

160
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:50,290
Hmm.

161
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:54,634
- Hotel-room sex.
- Curiosity, as in,

162
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,198
I've always wondered what it's like
to have sex with a really tall girl.

163
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,643
Not a big girl, just a tall girl.

164
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:05,946
Like, if a normal girl

165
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:09,817
were seven, seven-and-a-half-feet tall

166
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:14,449
and wore a denim miniskirt.

167
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,017
- I would have to know what that is like.
- Okay.

168
00:10:20,165 --> 00:10:23,225
He-said-he-loved-you-but-you're-not-ready
- to-say-it-back-yet sex.

169
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:24,859
Forty-three.

170
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,736
- Wingman diving on the friend grenade.
- Forty-four.

171
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,003
- The condoms are about to expire.
- Forty-five.

172
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:40,108
- Wow! This is getting a little hard.
- Forty-six!

173
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,249
Okay, four more to go.

174
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:48,588
You dropped a Cheeto on
his lap, and when you reached for it,

175
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:52,562
he thought you were making a move,
so you just went with it.

176
00:10:52,864 --> 00:10:56,061
Well, thank you for ruining the memory
of our six-month anniversary.

177
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:57,863
You got me Cheetos.

178
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:01,097
Look, can we just stop
with this stupid list, okay?

179
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:04,471
- You guys are making me sad.
- No, I'm having fun.

180
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,773
Man, this whole one-partner thing
sucks sometimes.

181
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,178
I'm always talking about you.
I can't play "I never,"

182
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:15,083
because then everyone would know
all the weird stuff I let you do to me.

183
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:18,554
The only weird thing I ever did to you
was open up my heart and soul,

184
00:11:18,657 --> 00:11:21,387
when all I had to do was strip naked
while you were out of the room.

185
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:24,656
I didn't sleep with Mitch
because he was naked.

186
00:11:24,763 --> 00:11:26,594
Mitch and I have something special.

187
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:29,030
I mean, fingers crossed, guys.
He may be the one.

188
00:11:29,134 --> 00:11:33,662
- The one? Mitch? The Naked Man?
- You mean the naked genius.

189
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:38,835
All these years I've been suiting up when
I should have been suiting down. That's it.

190
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:41,378
I am doing The Naked Man tonight.

191
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,004
- Ted, so are you.
- What?

192
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:45,948
With the elevator girl. You're going out
with her tonight, right? Naked Man!

193
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:47,780
No. Barney, come on, this is the first girl

194
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:49,615
I've had the courage to ask out
since Stella.

195
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:50,813
Naked Man!

196
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:53,220
No, Barney,
this is the eighth outfit I tried on tonight.

197
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:56,294
I got my hair cut three times,
I'm a nervous wreck.

198
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:58,555
Are you wearing makeup?

199
00:11:59,331 --> 00:12:03,290
It's not makeup, okay?
It's a sunscreen with a subtle tint of...

200
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:08,832
It's made for men.
Sue me, I want my eyes to pop.

201
00:12:11,543 --> 00:12:14,376
- Naked Man!
- No, Barney, I like Vicky.

202
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,707
This could actually go somewhere.

203
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:18,248
I don't want to do anything stupid
to jeopardize it.

204
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,411
Well, I really like that girl,

205
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:25,388
but... Oh! I didn't see her from the back.

206
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,721
I really like that girl.

207
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:33,264
And I'm willing to jeopardize our future
together for one night of glory.

208
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,896
Naked Man!

209
00:12:37,469 --> 00:12:40,063
<i>So, that night
we all set out to prove something.</i>

210
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,140
<i>Robin wanted to defend her honor.</i>

211
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,538
Mitch, hey, baby, it's me.

212
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:49,137
Robin. Do you want to grab
some dinner tonight?

213
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:53,718
Because you're basically my boyfriend!

214
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:56,916
<i>Lily needed to prove
that she could finish her list.</i>

215
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:59,820
I'm stuck. I can't think of the last two.

216
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,727
Reason Number 48,

217
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,560
"To reinforce good behaviors
such as shaving and dental hygiene. "

218
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,463
Oh, now you're conditioning me? Great!

219
00:13:09,568 --> 00:13:13,095
That explains
why I always get an erection when I floss.

220
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:16,738
<i>I had to prove that as scary
as it was to be dating again,</i>

221
00:13:16,842 --> 00:13:19,470
<i>I was over Stella
and ready to get back out there.</i>

222
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:22,809
<i>And Barney needed to prove that he, too,
could pull off The Naked Man.</i>

223
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:25,014
Hey, thank you for letting me
look at your aquarium.

224
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:27,550
- You're a real lifesaver.
- Sure, no problem.

225
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:31,053
I just need to use the bathroom
then I'll be on my way.

226
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:40,922
Ted, I'm doing it.
I'm doing The Naked Man!

227
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,457
Me, too!

228
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:50,300
I'm doing it! I'm doing The Naked Man!

229
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:52,933
That's great!
What made you change your mind?

230
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:56,844
Well, the date with Vicky started off okay,
but it didn't go as well as I hoped.

231
00:13:57,482 --> 00:14:00,679
Oh, my God, Ted, you are so funny.

232
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:03,754
And can I just say, you have amazing eyes.

233
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:05,823
What, these old things?

234
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:09,319
- Nice job, hotshot.
- I'm sorry...

235
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:13,090
Save it! Go tell the manager
he owes us an appetizer.

236
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,692
One of the ones with shrimp!
You're welcome. You were saying?

237
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:20,995
And then his cane missed the top step,

238
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:24,337
and he was falling for,
I swear, like, two minutes.

239
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:29,074
Oh, God, I love old people.

240
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,782
Once I realized there was
no possible future in this relationship,

241
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,080
- I just decided to go for it.
- Awesome.

242
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:40,783
Okay, big question, what pose
will you display your Naked Man in?

243
00:14:41,326 --> 00:14:42,293
Huh.

244
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,621
That is a big question.
I hadn't really thought about it.

245
00:14:44,729 --> 00:14:46,924
I was thinking the Superman.

246
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,727
What about the Captain Morgan?

247
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:56,639
How about the
"Oops, I didn't see you there"?

248
00:14:58,576 --> 00:14:59,941
The Thinker.

249
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:02,977
What about the Heisman?

250
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:05,446
Mr. Clean.

251
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,546
The Burt Reynolds.

252
00:15:17,195 --> 00:15:19,459
It's so great to see you again.

253
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,094
I really had a great time last night.

254
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:32,904
So, what is it like managing a CPK?

255
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:34,910
I mean, whose idea was it
to put a pineapple in the...

256
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,981
Okay, stop right there.
I know what this is.

257
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:41,407
I've been on this date before.
This is the "I'm not a slut" date.

258
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:44,146
What? That's crazy.

259
00:15:44,254 --> 00:15:47,018
Usually you read me so well,
but this time you're wrong.

260
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:48,352
Come on, Robin.

261
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:52,327
One of us had a good time last night,
and we both know it was me.

262
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:56,593
Mitchell something, that is just not true.

263
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,567
- Really? How was the sex?
- I didn't hate it.

264
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,367
Robin, you've seen my move. That's it.

265
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:08,541
I have nothing else to offer you.
I'm broke, I sweat when I eat,

266
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:10,840
and I'm in, like, five different
fantasy football leagues.

267
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:14,145
It's all I talk about. Trust me,
you don't want to be around that.

268
00:16:14,251 --> 00:16:16,913
What? Yes, I do.

269
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:19,486
Look, I didn't just sleep with you
because you were naked.

270
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,148
Yeah, you did.

271
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:23,123
And now you're trying to pretend
it was something more

272
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:25,320
to make yourself feel better.

273
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:28,865
Say what you will,
at least The Naked Man is honest.

274
00:16:30,534 --> 00:16:33,025
What about the old Coppertone Baby?

275
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:39,308
The Olympic gymnast
who stuck the landing.

276
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:44,542
- Yeah, I got to go.
- Naked Man!

277
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:49,815
You have a really nice place!

278
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,684
Oh, thanks! Coming from you,
that's a real compliment.

279
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,258
I just love that you're an architect.
It's so fascinating.

280
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:59,125
I could listen to you talk
about structural design all night.

281
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:01,728
<i>And then I noticed,
lying on her end table,</i>

282
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:04,323
<i>a book of love poems by Pablo Neruda.</i>

283
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:06,801
<i>The same edition I'd had since college.</i>

284
00:17:06,904 --> 00:17:08,872
<i>And it was bookmarked
to my favorite poem.</i>

285
00:17:11,442 --> 00:17:15,776
<i>Maybe I was all wrong about this girl.
Maybe there was a future for us.</i>

286
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,373
Crap!

287
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:26,613
Here we go.

288
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:28,920
Pablo Neruda.

289
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:32,725
Oh. Yeah, that book's a turd.

290
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,697
Some douchey guy I hooked up
with left it here. It's all in Mexican.

291
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:40,528
You know who writes good poems? Jewel.

292
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:43,572
Her teeth are crooked
and she lived in a car.

293
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:46,136
So, she has stuff to write about...

294
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:47,210
Ta-da!

295
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,016
Okay.

296
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,192
The Naked Man works.

297
00:18:04,294 --> 00:18:06,489
I just had decent sex
with an awful human being.

298
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:09,498
- I am back!
- Congratulations, buddy.

299
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,865
You're not the only one
who rocked The Naked Man tonight.

300
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,500
You just want to do it
to change the subject.

301
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:19,906
Yeah. Hey, that's Number 49.

302
00:18:20,811 --> 00:18:24,941
- Did it work?
- It's like I just flossed.

303
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:28,711
- I love you.
- That's 50.

304
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:30,047
Oh, yeah.

305
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:34,249
- Nice! What pose did you go with?
- I went with "I've got boobs. "

306
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:36,326
And she nailed it.

307
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:40,489
Oh, my God! Guys, guys, guys!
This is him.

308
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:44,055
- This is The Naked Man.
- Ted, his name is Mitch.

309
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:48,605
- And he's my boyfriend. So...
- It's okay, Robin. I no longer call slut.

310
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:49,672
Oh.

311
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:52,166
- Okay. You can go. We're done.
- Thanks.

312
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:55,074
No, Mitch, Mitch, I have to thank you.

313
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:57,374
- We all tried The Naked Man tonight.
- Oh.

314
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:00,348
Oh! We should see how Barney did.

315
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:06,019
- Hello?
- Hi, is Barney there?

316
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:07,090
No.

317
00:19:07,691 --> 00:19:10,159
Oh, my God! What's the matter with you?

318
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,955
- Get out!
- I just have to grab my suit.

319
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:14,622
- It's very expensive. The tie alone...
- Get out of here right now!

320
00:19:14,731 --> 00:19:18,497
- Get out, you sick son of a bitch!
- All right. Okay. Call me.

321
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:22,695
And if I see him again, I'm calling the cops.

322
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,469
Two out of three times.

323
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:33,645
Mitch, I want you to know, this night,
crazy as it was,

324
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,151
- it got me out of my shell.
- That's the beauty of The Naked Man.

325
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:41,315
It gives you exactly what you need.
No more, no less.

326
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:47,560
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to replace
one of my fantasy football quarterbacks.

327
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:49,689
He separated his shoulder!

328
00:19:54,404 --> 00:19:57,271
A toast to Mitch.

329
00:19:59,409 --> 00:20:03,004
By the sum of his parts, he is just a man.

330
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:06,048
But what he does with those parts,
he becomes so much more.

331
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:11,351
<i>He may not fit society's definition
of a hero, but he is the hero I needed.</i>

332
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:13,480
<i>The hero who helped me recover
from the disaster</i>

333
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:16,753
<i>of my failed almost-marriage
and get back into the game.</i>

334
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,492
<i>He lives in the shadows. Is he a dream?
Truth? Fiction? Damnation? Salvation?</i>

335
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:27,229
<i>He is all these things, and none of them,
for he is The Naked Man.</i>

336
00:20:30,774 --> 00:20:32,173
Oh, my God!

337
00:20:44,187 --> 00:20:45,745
Oh, thank God.
