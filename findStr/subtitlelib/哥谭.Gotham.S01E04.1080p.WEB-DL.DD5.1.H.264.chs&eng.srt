站住  不然我开枪了

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,750
他是被人栽赃

以掩盖真正的凶手

再也别回哥谭了
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

16
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,540
他杀了人

00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,990
是哥谭第一黑帮老大卡麦・法尔科内

我从来没见过吉姆的朋友
I never get to meet any of Jim's friends,

36
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,960
因为他从不告诉我任何事
'cause he never tells me anything.

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,740
-男人嘛  -可不是
- Men. - Don't I know.

38
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:29,360
要喝杯饮料吗
Would you like a drink?

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,340
不用了  他是工作上的朋友

40
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,340
来找我谈公事
It's a work thing.

41
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,060
我最近刚回哥谭
I'm just recently back in Gotham

42
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,120
就突然想来登门造访一下
and I had an idea to pop by out of the blue.

43
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,270
但显然来的不是时候
But now is clearly not a good time.

44
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,850
我送你出去
I'll walk you out.

45
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,130
我告诉过你永远别回来

我知道  我知道  我很抱歉

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,830
-但我真的有话想跟你说  -不行
- But I-I just wanted to speak with you. - No!

48
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,750
如果法尔科内发现你还活着  他会杀了我们
If Falcone finds out you're alive, he'll kill us both.

49
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,600
我无处可去
I got no place else to go.

50
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,990
哥谭是我的家
Gotham is my home.

51
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,400
我真该杀了你
I should've killed you.

52
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,040
我现在就该开枪打烂你的脑袋
I should put a bullet in your head right now.

53
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,730
你也完全有权利这么做
And you would have every right to do so.

54
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,720
但你不会  吉姆・戈登  因为你是好人
But you won't, Jim Gordon, because you're a good man.

55
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,230
你很可能是哥谭最后一个好人了
You may very well be the last good man in Gotham,

56
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,710
所以我要帮你
and that's why I want to help you.

57
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,180
-我不想要你帮  -或许吧  但你需要我
- I don't want your help. - No, no, but you need it.

58
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,420
那个恶婆娘菲什・穆尼  
That vile creature Fish Mooney,

59
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,440
法尔科内阁下  警察...
Don Falcone, the police--

60
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,670
甚至你的搭档都不信任你
not even your own partner trusts you.

61
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,780
他们总会对你隐瞒真相的
They will always hide the truth from you!

62
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,770
但我不会
But not me.

63
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,640
绝不会
Never.

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,950
你救了我的命
You saved my life.

65
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,720
天知道我有多后悔
God knows I wish I hadn't.

66
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:34,560
现在就杀了我  不然就相信我
Kill me now or trust me!

67
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,790
我告诉过你战争要来了  吉姆
I told you there's a war coming, Jim.

68
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,240
会死很多人
There will be so many deaths.

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,520
很多人
So many.

70
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,370
你想拯救哥谭吗  我可以帮你
You want to save Gotham? I can help you.

71
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,770
我可以给你当秘密特工
I can be your secret agent.

72
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,760
直到法尔科内发现你还活着
Until Falcone finds out you're alive.

73
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,680
没人会去找死人
Nobody looks for a dead man.

74
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,850
这场战争...
This war...

75
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,670
你到底在说什么  为什么会有战争
what are you talking about? Why will there be a war?

76
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,630
你也明白  战争只是政治的另一种手段
Well, as you know, war is just politics by other means.

77
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,640
而政治不就是钱和交易吗
And isn't politics just money, talking?

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,090
你指什么
Talking about what?

79
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,540
当然是阿卡姆
Arkham. Of course.

-有事吗  -是的
- Can I help you? - Yes, uh,

86

I don't want to...

90
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,560
过多占用您的宝贵时间
take up too much of your valuable time.

91
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,470
只是想给您看样东西
I just want to show you something.

92
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,220
我很乐意帮助选民
Well, I'm always happy to help constituents,

93
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,840
但你该到办公室找我
but perhaps you can come by my office.

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,690
先生  求求您  就一小会儿
Sir, please, just one second.

95
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,530
是这样的
Now...

96
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,200
这个想法我已经思考了
I got the idea for this...

97
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,700
好几年了
years ago.

98
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,230
是我自己设计制造的
Designed and built it myself.

99
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,530

看啊  你就
Go ahead. You...

102

眼睛对准末端看
just put your eye in the end there.

103
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,960
对了就这样
That's it.

104
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,860
-这什么东西  -您会明白的
- What is that thing? - You'll see.

105
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,650

哥谭
第一季  第四集

114
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,710
我在工作
Hey, I'm working.

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,190
来了个双尸命案  轮到你了
Caught a double homicide. You're up.

116
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,630
不对吧  阿尔瓦雷斯这一周都没案子
Uh, no way. Alvarez hasn't done a case all week.

117
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,210
该他了
It's his turn.

118
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,500
阿尔瓦雷斯上周加了双倍的班
Alvarez put in double overtime last week.

119
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,680
-戈登  -警监
- Hey, Gordon. - Captain.

120
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,060
市议员罗恩・詹金斯与其助手
Councilman Ron Jenkins and his aide

121
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,320
今晨被发现死在一停车场

122
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,070
还在等法医报告出来
Still waiting on the M.E.'s report,

123
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,340
不过他们的钱包和首饰都不见了
but their wallets and jewelry were missing.

124
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,340
市议员  也许是政治暗杀
A councilman. Maybe it's a political hit.

125
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,900
不会的  没人会去暗杀市议员
Nah, no one hits councilmen.

126
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,100
还不如行贿花的钱少
It's cheaper to bribe 'em.

127
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,350
杀了他们又会有别的废物
You kill 'em and another bum

128
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,400
伸着贪婪的手来顶替他的位子
with his hand out just takes his place.

129
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
你们可以去市政厅打探一下
Sniff around city hall if you want.

130
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,900
我敢说  这不过就是不幸的意外
Smart money says this was just wrong place, wrong time.

131
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,200
快干活儿去
Go work it.

132
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,900
你个奴隶主
Slave driver.

133
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,120
别担心  吉姆
Don't worry, Jim.

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,590
我知道该从何下手
I know just where to start.

135
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,950
再度茫然若失*
*All at sea again

136
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,370
心内的飓风*
*And now my hurricanes

137
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,340
让这片海下起了倾盆大雨*
*Have brought down this ocean rain

138
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,480

She's got talent.

139
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,970
长得也不赖
She's not bad-looking.

140
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,710
够了
That's plenty.

141
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,420
过来  让我好好看看
Come to me so I can take you in.

142
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,480
唱得不错
You sing well.

143
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:30,710
但要干这活儿  光有一副好嗓子和一张俏脸蛋
For this job, I need more than a pair of nice pipes

144
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,080
可不够
and a pretty face.

145
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,790
我什么都愿意干
I'll do whatever it takes.

146
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,790
这话我爱听  那么
I like hearing that. So...

147
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,340
你喜欢男的还是女的
you like boys or girls?

148
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,530
男的
Boys.

149
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,620
好吧
Fine.

150
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,450
假装我是个男的
Pretend I'm a boy.

151
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,430
引诱我
Seduce me.

152
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,310
至少你会唱歌
Least you can sing.

153
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,030
布奇
Butch?

154
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,390
记上这个
Put a pin in this one.

155
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,810
我们会打给你的
We'll call you.

156
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,400
还凑合  不过继续找
Not bad but keep looking.

157
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,180
不是吧  老大  那可是个美女啊
Really, boss? That's a good-looking girl.

158
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,300
看着我
Look at me.

159
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,510
我要找的不是美女
I ain't looking for no girl.

160
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,700
而是武器
I'm looking for a weapon.

161
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,900
得了  尼奇  别谦虚了
Come on, Nicky, don't be modest.

162
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,210
你就是停车场抢劫小王子
You're the crown prince of parking lot muggers.

163
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,080
没人比你名气大
No one's got a bigger rep.

164
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,400
我在休假好吗
I'm on sabbatical.

165
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,920
我没杀人  不是我风格
I didn't kill no one. That's not my thing.

166
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,190
那你背包里怎么有把匕首
Then why'd you have a shank in your backpack?

167
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,820
防身用的
Protection.

168
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,070
詹金斯议员被杀了
Councilman Jenkins was murdered.

169
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,350
我们知道是你干的
We know it was you.

170
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,320
-我们有证人  -我发誓我没杀人
- We got witnesses. - I swear to God I didn't do it!

171
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,590
他不是我们要找的人  哈维
He's not our guy, Harvey.

172
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,870
阿尔瓦雷斯
Alvarez.

173
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,980
这是什么
What's this?

174
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,580
犯罪现场的证据
Evidence from your crime scene.

175
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,600
刚几个警员送过来的
Couple of unis just dropped it off.

176
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,810
{\an8}阿卡姆区开发提案

180
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,950
哥谭市最后一个未开发的大区
The last major undeveloped district in the city of Gotham,

181
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,550
阿卡姆
Arkham.

182
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,990
托马斯和玛莎・韦恩不幸遇害之前
Now, before their untimely and tragic deaths,

183
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:36,450
他们对这座城市有自己的规划
Thomas and Martha Wayne had a plan for their city,

184
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,160
渐进式的开发计划
a progressive development plan

185
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,470
将阿卡姆的棚户区夷为平地  取而代之的
that would raze Arkham's shanty towns and, in its place,

186
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,940
将是全新的经济适用房
build new, affordable housing

187
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,950
提供给哥谭的贫苦百姓
for Gotham's less fortunate.

188
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,670
那老疯人院呢  市长
What about the old asylum, Mayor?

189
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,900
全拆了  不剩一砖一瓦
Torn down. Brick by brick, if need be.

190
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,270
取而代之的是高端先进的
And in its place, a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art

191
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,770
心理治疗机构
mental health facility.

192
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,660
这是我们城市未来的蓝图
This is a vision for the future of our city.

193
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,510
日前有一对立计划呼声很高
An opposing plan is gaining support recently.

194
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,420
那个计划彻底放弃了疯人院
A plan that would do away with the asylum altogether,

195
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,590
在周围兴建废弃物处理厂
use the surrounding land as a waste disposal site.

196
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,390
这可不行
No.

197
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,270
韦恩夫妇的计划是最有利于本市
No, the Wayne plan is best for this city

198
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,950
最重要的是  也是最有利于哥谭人民的
and, more importantly, for the people of this city.

199
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,140
所以我全力支持这项计划
This is why I am endorsing it.

200
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,990
{\an8}巴蒙特餐馆

201
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,750

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,720
请坐  请坐
Please, please, have a seat.

205
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,110
我去拿酒和面包
I'll bring wine and bread.

206
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,910
今天是值得庆祝的日子
Today is a day of celebration.

207
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,570
一桩大买卖就要上门了
A very lucrative deal is coming my way.

208
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,000
地盘  朋友
Land, my friend.

209
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,160
地盘
Land.

210
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,440
那才是真正赚钱的东西
That's where the big money is, huh?

211
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,680
我需要韦恩家族关于阿卡姆的计划
I need information about the Wayne plan for Arkham.

212
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,740
虽说是韦恩的  但现在只是挂名了
Well, it's the Wayne... plan in name only now.

213
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,520
韦恩夫妇死后
When the Waynes died,

214
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,330
法尔科内插了进来  他现在负责计划了
Falcone stepped in. He's backing the plan now.

215
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,740
如果计划能通过  他会做出很多改变
And he stands to make quite a chunk of change, if it passes.

216
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,610
但是詹金斯议员是支持法尔科内的啊
But Councilman Jenkins was backing Falcone's plan.

217
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,670
没错
That's right.

218
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,660
那么他被杀是因为
Then he was killed because...

219
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,020
是因为  警探  出现了一个对立计划
Because, detective, there is an opposing plan.

220
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,230
马罗尼
Maroni.

221
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,360
他是唯一有能力对抗法尔科内的人
He's the only one strong enough to oppose Falcone.

222
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,240
他想插一脚阿卡姆
He's making a play at Arkham.

223
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,200
他们之间有联系吗
Are they related?

224
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,100
布鲁斯
Bruce.

225
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,420
你怎么样
How are you?

226
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,240
新阿卡姆疯人院将以全新的方式
"A new Arkham Asylum will serve the mentally ill of Gotham

227
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,310
服务于哥谭的精神病人
in ways the present asylum never can.

228
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,740
那些饱受疾病折磨的灵魂需要我们的帮助
Those poor, sick souls deserve our help."

229
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,510
这是我妈妈写的
My mother wrote that.

230
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,130
她和我爸爸为建新疯人院努力了好多年
She and my father fought for years to get a new asylum built.

231
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,060
他们认为通过帮助城市最不幸的人
They thought that if they can help the city's least fortunate,

232
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,920
可以让其他人都看到一丝希望
it would show there was hope for everyone.

233
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,860
我真不希望我父母的梦想与他们一同逝去
I just don't want my parents' dream to die with them.

234
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,160
我明白  布鲁斯
I understand that, Bruce.

235
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,650
但这不仅仅是疯人院的事
But this isn't just about the asylum.

236
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,580
如果法尔科内和马罗尼之间真有争斗
If there is a fight between Falcone and Maroni,

237
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,470
这可能会成为引发全市帮派战争的导火索
this could be the spark that ignites a citywide gang war.

238
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,250
无辜者会因此丧命
Innocents will die,

239
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,540
人们对警察的保护还尚存的一点信念
and whatever little faith people have that the police can protect them...

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,250
到时都会被击垮
...it will be crushed.

241
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,230
那你得阻止他们
So you have to stop it.

242
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,610
我是戈登
This is Gordon.

243
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,070
是我  我们接到报案
Hey, it's me. We got a call.

244
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,070
市议员泽勒被绑架了
Councilman Zeller's been abducted.

245
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,070
听着  戈登  泽勒是马罗尼的人
Listen, Gordon, Zeller's one of Maroni's guys.

246
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,090
马上到
Be right there.

247
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,400
阿卡姆疯人院

248
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,610
阿卡姆疯人院

249
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,160
阿卡姆疯人院

250
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,500
求你...
Please...

251
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,410
不要  我求你了
Don't. I-I'm begging you.

252
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,230
我...
I... aah...!

253
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,780
知道吗
You know...

254
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,830
如果我说了算
if it were up to me,

255
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,120
就会让你死得痛快点  不必搞这么多幺蛾子
this would be over quick, without all the fuss.

256
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,640
我父亲以前常说
My father used to say,

257
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,370
大精若朴
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."

258
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,510
但现在不是我说了算
But it's not up to me.

259
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,530
我的客户明确要求
And my customer specifically asked me to...

260
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,150
要用你的死传个信
send a message.

261
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,390
你也知道俗话怎么说
And you know what they say:

262
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,120
客户永远正确
the customer is always right.

263
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,140
求你了  救命啊
Please... help!

264
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,330
你...你不必这么做
You-you-you-you... you don't have to do this!

265
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,220
救命啊
Help me, somebody!

266
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,530
不  不要
No, wait.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,130
告诉法尔科内  票是可以改的
Tell Falcone I'll change my vote.

268
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,210
我会支持市长的
Hey-hey, I'll-I'll back the mayor.

269
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,960
他让我干什么都行  求你了
I'll do anything he wants, but please, please!

270
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,370
求你了  不
Please... No! Please!

271
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,260
求你了  不要
Please! Please don't!

272
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,960
{\an8}阿卡姆疯人院

273
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,030
几天内两名市议员被杀
Two councilmen dead in as many days.

274
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,410
肯定不是巧合
Can't be a coincidence.

275
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,490
一定是有什么政治因素
Got to be politics driving this.

276
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,470
他是对的
He was right.

277
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,760
我又没说他不对
I never said he was wrong.

278
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,270
只是不希望他说对罢了
I just wanted him to be.

279
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,530
好了  福尔摩斯
All right, genius,

280
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,880
还有何高见
any other insights?

281
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,860
有  这都是为了阿卡姆提案表决
Yeah. This is about the Arkham vote.

282
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,050
怎么说
How so?

283
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,910
阿卡姆不止是土地交易  而是一场战争
Arkham is more than just a land deal; it's a war

284
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,670
是法尔科内和马罗尼之间的战争
between Falcone and Maroni.

285
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,720
这两个市议员分属不同的阵营
These councilmen were on opposite sides of that war.

286
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,070
那是谁干的
So, who did who?

287
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,500
依我看  是马罗尼先动的手
The way I see it, Maroni struck first.

288
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,210
杀了詹金斯  好让大家投他的票
He had Jenkins killed to change the vote his way.

289
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,820
然后法尔科内以牙还牙
Then Falcone retaliated,

290
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,970
杀了泽勒  把票赢回来
had Zeller killed to change the vote back.

291
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:08,850
烧尸体就是法尔科内发出的警告
Burning the body was Falcone's way of sending a message.

292
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,770
这事了结之前  我会给市议员
I'll have guards put on all the other councilmen

293
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,770
还有市长增派安保
and the mayor till this plays out.

294
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,250
你不想说说吗
So, you want to tell me?

295
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,700
快说  法尔科内  马罗尼  阿卡姆
Come on. Falcone, Maroni, Arkham?

296
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,770
你怎么突然消息这么灵通
How the hell do you know so much all a sudden?

297
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,530
爱德  查到什么了
Ed, what you got?

298
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,740
这事有点矛盾
I have a paradox for you.

299
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,610
什么
What?

300
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,620
警探  矛盾就是...
Well, a paradox, detective, is when you have...

301
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,800
我知道矛盾是什么意思  机灵鬼
I know what a paradox is, smartass.

302
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,030
怎么矛盾了
What paradox?

303
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,720
这是法医关于詹金斯议员
These are the medical examiner's reports

304
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,080
及其助手被杀一案的尸检报告
on the murders of Councilman Jenkins and his aide.

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,640
我的地盘上滋事  还能安然无事
in my place of business and get away with it?

462
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,550
他想错了  弗兰基
He's got another thing coming, Frankie.

463
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,130
我要回击
I want to hit him back.

464
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,920
这一次下手要准要狠
This time, where it hurts.

465
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,100
要打在要害上
I want to hit The Mouth.

466
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,110
是时候了
It's time, son.

467
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,630
我会处理的
I'll take care of it.

468
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,820
还有那小子
Then there's the other thing.

469
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,440
叫他来
Send him over.

470
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:43,580
你知道我这人该表示感谢的时候  绝不会吝啬
You know I'm a man that shows appreciation when appreciation is due.

471
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,280
是  马罗尼阁下
Yes, Don Maroni.

472
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,710
你昨天的所作所为  我都记在心里了
What you did for me yesterday did not go unnoticed.

473
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,410
谢谢您  先生
Well, thank you, sir.

474
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,320
我只希望我当时能取回
I-I only wish I was able to retrieve the...

475
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,630
-剩下的  -得得得
- retrieve the other half of your... - Bup-bup-bup-bup.

476
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,870
你洗了多久的盘子了
How long you been washing dishes?

477
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,900
-没多久  -从现在起你不用洗了
- Not long. - All right, that ends today.

478
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,470
你升职了  做餐馆经理
You've been promoted to restaurant manager.

479
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,850
这职位刚刚空出来了
The position recently became available.

480
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,260
多谢您  马罗尼阁下
Thank you, Don Maroni.

481
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,250
-我绝不会让您失望  -嗯嗯
- I won't let you down. - Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,110
不客气
You're welcome.

483
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,790
弗兰基  给这小子置办套正装
Frankie, get the kid a suit.

484
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,090
他死了
He's dead.

485
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,830
谁死了
Who?

486
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,510
理查德・格拉德韦尔
Richard Gladwell.

487
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,730
起码本尊是死了
At least, the real one.

488
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,280
派了警员去他的公寓  发现
Sent some unis by his apartment, found a...

489
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,360
有具腐尸藏在里面
moldy old corpse sealed inside.

490
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,190
眼上有刺穿伤  死了五年了
Puncture wound through the eye; been dead five years.

491
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,630
这么长时间才发现他
And no one found him until now?

492
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,540
房东说他按时交房租
Landlord said he paid his rent on time,

493
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,690
平时又安静  简直是完美房客
kept quiet-- the ideal tenant.

494
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,630
也就是说这杀手干掉了格拉德韦尔
So our Hit Man killed this Gladwell

495
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,460
用他的身份作掩护
to use his identity as cover.

496
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,930
而且也成效显著
And it worked, too.

497
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,930
雇员记录  薪金纪录  联系信息
Employee records, payroll, contact information

498
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:11,960
全是假的
all fake.

499
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,550
除了张脸  我们什么线索都没有
We got nothing but a face.

500
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,840
该死
Damn.

501
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,870
好吧
All right...

502
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,570
这里面肯定有名堂
Well, there's got to be something to this.

503
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,820
这三个字母  你有想法吗
"C-L-M." You got any ideas?

504
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,070
就是浪费时间
It's a complete waste of time.

505
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,150
但这是线索  唯一的线索
It's a lead. Our only lead.

506
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,100
就你这么想
Says you.

507
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,820
你怎么能这么懒
You can't be this lazy.

508
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,600
懒  没准是我办案手法比你高明
Lazy? Maybe I just work smarter than you.

509
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,750
这你想过没
Ever consider that?

510
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,510
是啊  我想过了
Yeah. I considered it.

511
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,370
听着  阿卡姆提案明天就要表决了
Look, this Arkham vote is tomorrow--

512
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,720
如果到那时我们还没抓住这人
we don't find this guy by then...

513
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,430
怎么  会怎样
What? What happens?

514
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:44,990
最坏的局面  黑帮全面开战
Worst case: a major gang war.

515
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,780
会死人  没准会死很多人
People will die. Maybe a lot of people.

516
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,380
只要抓住这人  就能阻止这一切
We find this guy, we can stop it.

517
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,130
你要去哪
And where are you going?

518
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,220
办案去
To work the case.

519
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,120
你有张良计  我有过墙梯
You got your ways, I got mine.

520
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,220
哈维
Hey, Harvey...

521
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,790
代我向她问好
tell her I said hi.

522
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,530
你听那笑声*

523
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,290
响彻大厅*
*Cracking through the halls

让你起舞的欲望*
*It sends you spinning

525
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,640
不可抵挡*
*You have no choice

526
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,040
随着那舞曲*
*Following the footsteps

527
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,210
舞步残破*
*Of a rag doll dance

528
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,130
我们全都*
*We are entranced

529
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,980
意乱情迷*
*Spellbound

530
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,080
意乱情迷*
*Spellbound

531
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,990
意乱*
*Spell...

532
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,360
情迷*
*Bound

533
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,160
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

534
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,040
莉莎
Liza.

535
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,520
你唱歌多久了  莉莎
How long have you been singing, Liza?

536
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,940
没多久
Not long.

537
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,040
你喜欢男的还是女的
You like boys or girls?

538

男的
Boys.

539
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,670
你想要这份工作吗
So... you want the job, or what?

540
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,360
你还没告诉我是什么工作
Well, you haven't told me what it is yet.

541
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,120
你想拥有权力  金钱和尊重
You want to be a woman with power,

542
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,310
成为像我一样的女人吗

543
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,940
我想是的
I guess. Yeah.

544
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,930
你愿意为了这个目标不惜一切代价吗
Are you willing to do whatever it takes to have it all?

545
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,290
是的  我愿意
Yes. I am.

546
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,550
工作就是这样
That's the job.

547
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,680
引诱我
Seduce me.

548
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,310
什么
What...?

549
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,060
你认为我是在开玩笑吗
You think I'm kidding?

550
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,940
哈维
Harvey...

551
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,840
看到什么喜欢的了吗
you see something you like?

552
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,360
就在眼前
I do now.

553
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,670
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

554
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,310
市议员一个接一个地死掉
City councilmen are dropping like flies.

555
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,640
-我听说了  -对生意不好
- I heard. - Bad for business.

556
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,730
你说得没错
You're not wrong.

557
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,000
下手的是个叫格拉德韦尔的家伙  认识吗
The button man's a guy called Gladwell-- you know him?

558
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,740
听说过
Only by reputation.

559
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,340
你能找到他吗
Think you can find him?

560
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,470
只要我有时间  谁都能找到
I can find anyone if I have the time.

561
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,460
问题在于  我有什么好处
The question is, what's in it for me?

562
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,060
算我欠你的
I'll owe you.

563
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,110
好吧  我还是觉得这是在浪费时间
Okay, but I still think it's a waste of time, if you ask me.

564
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,810
法尔科内会找其他人顶上
Falcone'll just get someone to take his place.

565
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,870
他不会放弃的
He's not gonna let this bone go.

566
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,990
为什么
Why's that?

567
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,010
法尔科内输不起这次表决
Falcone cannot afford to lose that vote.

568
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:10,680
马罗尼只要拿到阿卡姆的一块砖
If Maroni gets even a piece of Arkham,

569
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,000
就证明了众所皆知的事情
it'll only prove what we already know.

570
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:17,420
那就是  法尔科内老了  不中用了
And that is: Falcone is old and weak.

571
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,290
你看起来挺开心啊
You seem kind of pleased about that.

572
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,380
怎么回事
How come?

573
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,310
法尔科内垮台  你也不好过
Falcone goes down, so do you.

574
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,680
哈维
Harvey...

575
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,970
别担心我
don't you worry about me.

576
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,650
我总有后备计划
I always have a Plan B.

577
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,960

Detective Gordon.

578
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,810
你好  老朋友
Hello, old friend.

579
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,660

What do you want?

580

给你提供帮助
To offer you help.

581
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,590
证明你可以信任我
To prove that you can trust me.

582
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,610
会有另一起凶案
There's gonna be another murder.

583
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,360
马罗尼已经派出杀手了
Maroni has put out the hit.

584
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,550
目标是谁
Who's the target?

585
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,850
支持法尔科内的人
Someone backing Falcone's plan.

586
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,360
具体是谁我说不好
Who it is, I can't be certain.

587
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,880
今晚所有的市议员都有警察保护
All the councilmen are under police protection tonight.

588
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:06,240
警察是很好买通的
There are many ways around the police.

589
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,880
今晚绝对会有人遭刺杀
But the hit will happen tonight--

590
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,550
这我能肯定
that much I can be certain of.

591
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,790
你怎么知道的
How do you know this?

592
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,930
我说过了  警探
I told you, Detective--

593
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,040
哥谭是我的家
Gotham is my home.

594
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,560
给我今晚去执行保护任务的警员名单
I need a list of the officers working police protection tonight.

595
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,840

601
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,360
戈登警探  什么事

602
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,960
市长阁下  我认为您可能有危险
Sir, I think your life may be in danger.

603
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,560
-我得带您离开这儿  -什么  不
- I need to get you out of here. - What? No, I...

604
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,230
我不会离开的  有警察保护我呢
I'm not going anywhere-- I got police protection.

605
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,020
-他们走了  -什么
- They're gone. - What?

606
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,720
我刚刚看过了  根本没人在

先生  我觉得有人要来杀你

608

609

先生  我们得马上走了
Sir, we need to go-- now.

610
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,150
我已经在尽快了
I'm moving as fast as I can.

611
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,430
我能带您去什么地方吗
Is there someplace I can take you?

612
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,430
安全的地方
Somewhere you'll be safe?

613
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,970
我们不去警局吗
We're not going to the police station?

614
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,540
我不敢肯定那里会很安全  警察都...
I'm not sure you'll be safe there. The police...

615
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,030
-这个城市是怎么了  -先生
- What the hell is this town com-coming to? - Sir.

616
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,640
好了  好了  我...
All right, all right, I'm...

617
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,310
我姐姐家  在城市另一边
My sister's house. It's across town.

618
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,780
走吧
Let's go.

619
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,180
快走
Go! Go! Go!

620
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,180
还有别的出路吗
Is there another way out?

621
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,050
这边
Here.

622
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,840
他想闯进来
He's trying to get in.

623
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,270
开枪啊  你怎么不打他
Shoot him. Why don't you shoot him?

624
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,400
没办法  他拿了我的枪  快走
He's got my gun. I can't. Go, go, go!

625
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,290
放下武器
Drop it!

626
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,970
放下  否则我开枪了
Drop it or I'll shoot!

627
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,100
你知道人们为什么雇职业杀手吗
You know why they hire a professional?

628
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,270
因为他总能完成任务
'Cause he finishes the job.

629
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,390
你还好吧
How are you?

630
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,580
挺好
Okay.

631
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,200
吉姆  我早该把蒙托亚的事告诉你
Jim, I should've told you about Montoya a long time ago.

632
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,190
-那你为什么没说  -我说不清
- Then why didn't you? - I don't know.

633
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,390
因为她跟你共事
Because she works with you.

634
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,740
因为她是女的
Because she's a woman.

635
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,880
你确定没有别的原因了吗
Are you sure there isn't another reason?

636
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,930
没了  没别的了
No. There's nothing else.

637
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,600
吉姆  我不希望我们之间有秘密
Jim, I don't want there to be any secrets between us.

638
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,820
-我也是  -那就好
- Neither do I. - Good.

639
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,720
那你就告诉我奥斯瓦尔德・科波特是谁
So you'll tell me who Oswald Cobblepot is.

640
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,560
芭芭拉  你为什么就不能忘了这事呢
Damn it, Barbara. Why can't you drop this?

641
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,720
-你为什么不能告诉我他是谁呢  -因为
- Why can't you just tell me who he is? - Because...

642
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,390
这是工作上的事
...it's work.

643
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,210
我知道  但你以前也跟我说过工作的事
I know. But you've told me about your work before.

644
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,510
那是个错误
And that was a mistake.

645
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,520
我不会再犯那种错误了
One I am not going to make again.

646
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,910
好吧
All right. Well...

647
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,290
我不要过这种日子
I'm not gonna live like this.

648
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,710
我不能过这种日子
I can't live like this.

649
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,480
你得做出选择  吉姆
You're gonna have to make a choice, Jim.

650
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,900
要么告诉我  要么放弃我
You either let me in or you let me go.

651
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,200
好了
All right.

652
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,950
我就直说了
I'm going to cut to the chase.

653
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,550
你们两个我都喜欢  但我只能招一个人
I like you both, but I only have one opening.

654
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,820
你挺有才
You've got the talent.

655
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,890
而你...
And you've got...

656
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,360
有点别的东西
...something else.

657
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,070
我无法决定
I can't decide, so...

658
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,330
所以  只能让你俩来替我决定了
you two are going to have to do it for me.

659
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,290
你要我们打架啊
You want us to fight for it?

660
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,630
我什么时候开始上班
So when do I start?

661
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,120
是你啊
It's you.

662
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,850
吓死我们了
Scared us there for a second.

663
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,080
我们做得很棒吧
We do good or what?

664
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:59,890
简直太漂亮了  朋友们
Excellent work, my friends.

665
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,020
你们很像那么回事
You were very convincing.

666
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,050
那个经理肯定是这么想的
Yeah, I bet that manager sure thought so, huh?

667
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,370
是不是  迪克
Ain't that right, Dickie?

668
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,870
还有哪个馆子你想让我们去抢  尽管说
You got any other joints you want us to rob, let us know.

669
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,250
-报酬丰厚啊  -可不是
- Good money in this. - Yeah, good money.

670
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,450
那是什么
What's that?

671
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,090
我带了奶油甜馅煎饼卷来
Oh, I brought cannoli.

672
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,310
太好了
Oh, yeah!

673
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,090
吃吧
Now, eat up.

674
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,440
这是你们应得的
You guys deserve this.

675
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,860
看啊
Check this out.

676
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,840
真不错
Really good.

677
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,220
太好吃了
Oh, real good.

678
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,340
阿卡姆开发提案表决几周来一直争议不断
The Arkham development vote has been a topic of controversy for weeks.

679
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,610
今天  结果终于出来了
Today we have the results.

680
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,400
我们现在直播詹姆斯市长的新闻发布会
We go live now to Mayor James's press conference.

681
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,480
能小点声吗  我头要疼死了
Do you mind turning that down? My head's killing me.

682
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,700
闭嘴吧
Aw, shut up.

683
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,580
我们辛辛苦苦不就为了这个
This is what we worked for.

684
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,620
这是我们促成的
We did this.

685
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:07,950
今天的结果难道不是韦恩计划的落空吗
How is today's outcome not simply a failure of the Wayne plan?

686
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,110
这并非任何一个计划的落空
This is not a case of either plan failing.

687
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:12,230
这是妥协
This is a case of compromise

688
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,520
{\an8}市长宣布阿卡姆开发提案表决结果

689
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,750
是为了哥谭人民的利益
for what's best for the people of Gotham.

690
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,620
阿卡姆区将同时用作廉价住房
The Arkham district will be developed into both low-cost housing

691
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,710
和我们迫切需要的废弃物处理厂的开发
as well as a much-needed site for waste disposal.

692
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,890
这是吸取了两个计划最好的部分
This is the best of both plans...

693
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,410
合二为一
together in one.

694
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,650
太好了
Yes.

695
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:33,450
多年来  这座城市只给我们残羹冷炙
For years, this city's been giving us nothing but scraps.

696
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,770
从今往后
But from now on...

697
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,130
从今往后
from now on...

698
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,240
我们要享用饕餮盛宴了
we feast.

699
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,020
詹姆斯市长  那疯人院呢
Mayor James, what about the asylum?

700
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,490
将会何去何从
What's going to happen to it?

701
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,960
阿卡姆疯人院将进行翻修
Arkham Asylum will be retrofitted

702
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,830
达到当今标准  然后重开
to meet today's standards and reopened.

703
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,100
哥谭需要...不
Gotham needs... No,

704
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:53,330
哥谭应该
Gotham deserves

705
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,360
有座世界一流的
a world-class treatment facility

706
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,730
精神病院
for the mentally ill.

707
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,750
法尔科内今天受了打击
Falcone took a shot to the body today.

708
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,920
或许再挨几下  他就会倒下了
Maybe a few more will put him on his back.

709
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,490
看来你来的正是时候
Looks like I got you just in time.

710
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,170
我确信  韦恩夫妇
And I know that the Waynes,

711
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,410
如果他们还活着
were they still alive,

712
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,530
也会为我们今日的成就感到自豪
would be proud of what we've been able to accomplish today.

713
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,370
市长把这个新计划说得好像对哥谭有利
The mayor's making this new plan sound like it's good for Gotham.

714
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,150
-但其实不是的  对吗  -的确
- But-but it's not, is it? - No, it's not.

715
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,490
那他为什么要这么做
Then why is he doing it?

716
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,600
他夹在两股厉害的敌对势力之间
He was caught between two very powerful opposing forces.

717
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,740
法尔科内和马罗尼
Falcone and Maroni.

718
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,870
马罗尼威胁到了市长的性命
Maroni threatened the mayor's life.

719
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,860
我猜市长是出于恐惧
Out of fear, I'm guessing,

720
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,150
向马罗尼妥协
the mayor made a compromise

721
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,310
给他分了阿卡姆很大一杯羹
and gave Maroni a huge piece of Arkham.

722
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,490
你指什么
What piece?

723
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,550
马罗尼获批兴建一个废弃物处理厂
Maroni gets to build a waste disposal site

724
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:51,360
他还拿到了翻修阿卡姆疯人院的合同
and he gets the contract to refurbish Arkham.

725
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,140
法尔科内获批兴建廉价住房
Falcone gets to build a low-income housing project.

726
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,630
听我说
Look...

727
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:03,170
布鲁斯  我知道这并非你所期待的结果
Bruce, I know it's not the outcome you had hoped for,

728
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:05,650
但这个妥协
but this compromise

729
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,730
可能避免了很多流血冲突
may have prevented a lot of bloodshed.

730
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,820
甚至阻止了一场战争
It may have even stopped a war.

731
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,730
我父母相信新疯人院能给哥谭带来希望
My parents believed a new asylum would bring hope to Gotham.

732
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,220
这下落空了
Now that's gone.

733
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,410
他们为之努力的一切
Everything they worked for

734
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,330
如今都落入了罪犯之手
is now falling into the hands of criminals.

735
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,470
也不是一切
Not everything.

736
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,880
你还活着
You're alive.

737
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,010
还不迟
It's not too late.

738
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,520
你真这么认为吗
Do you really believe that?

739
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,290
你真的认为哥谭可以获得救赎吗
Do you believe Gotham can be saved?

740
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,350
我相信这值得我们努力
I believe it's worth trying.
