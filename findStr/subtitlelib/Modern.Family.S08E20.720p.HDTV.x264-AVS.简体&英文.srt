杰和我合伙开了个停车场
Jay and I are partners in a parking lot,

39
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,840
这为我们的感情增添了新活力
and it's added a wonderful, new dynamic to our relationship.

40
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,270
第一步是要雇人在收费亭收费
The first step was hiring someone to man the booth.

41
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,800
我们将候选范围缩小到了来应征的两个人
We narrowed it down to the two candidates who applied.

42
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,140
我认为与其让人们觉得
I don't think it should be,

43
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,730
"我真希望我总去吃午餐的餐厅
"I hope there's a place to park

44
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,480
旁边有个方便停车的地方"
near where I love to have lunch."

45
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,470
不如让人们觉得
I think it should be,

46
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,040
"我真希望我总去停车的停车场
"I hope there's a place to have lunch

47
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,610
旁边有个方便吃午餐的地方"
near where I love to park."

48
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,450
那么  蒂伯
So, Tibor,

49
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,800
跟我们说说在停车场工作让你激动的理由
tell us why you're excited about a career in parking.

50
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,760
工作好
Is good.

51
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,030
这个问题很难回答
That's a tough one.

52
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,320
在我心里排名前三的是
My top three...

53
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,810
真命天女组合
Destiny's Child...

54
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,180
-珍妮·杰克逊  -太棒了
- Janet Jackson... - ‭Yes.

55
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,670
和我的最爱  金属乐队
and my fave... Metallica.

56
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,960
我的天  你的口味真多元化
Oh, my goodness, you are so complex.

57
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,650
蒂伯  你最喜欢哪个流派的音乐
Tibor, what are your favorite kinds of music?

58
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,170
蒂伯
Tibor.

59
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,270
不错吧
Is good?

60
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,900
我认为该选谁显而易见
Well, I think the choice is clear.

61
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,890
-蒂伯  -琼
- Tibor. - Joan.

62
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,620
蒂伯
Tibor?

63
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,710
我喜欢他的热情  因为他没有热情
I like his energy. He doesn't have any.

64
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,320
我喜欢琼  她很有趣
Well, I like Joan. She's fun.

65
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,480
那就请她看电影去  这是做生意
Take her to the movies. This is a business.

66
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,390
看来我们意见又不统一了
Looks like we're at a stand-off.

67
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,840
天啊  别掏硬币
God, not the coin.

68
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,990
哪怕像我和杰这样的超级好伙伴
Even super-duper pals like Jay and I

69
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,370
也有意见相左的时候
disagree sometimes,

70
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,730
于是  我想到了这个宝贝主意
so... I dreamed up this baby.

71
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,070
如果是菲尔这面朝上  我赢
If it comes up Phil, I win.

72
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,880
如果是杰这面朝上  他赢
If it comes up Jay, he wins.

73
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,720
他特别讨厌这枚硬币  但我告诉他
He hated this, but I told him,

74
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,410
"谁的脸铸到硬币上看起来都胖九斤"
"The coin adds 10 pounds."

75
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,130
这次游行会特别激进吗
So, how hard-core is this march going to be?

76
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,460
只是一群和平的女人
Just a peaceful gathering of women

77
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,160
共同为性别平等这个目标而努力
working towards the same goal of equality.

78
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,900
不会集体烧文胸什么的
We're not burning bras or anything.

79
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,830
那就好  因为我刚买了第一件文胸
Good, 'cause I just got my first one.

80
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,310
要烧也得等我穿着它去内奥米家过夜之后
I'm not torching it before Naomi's sleepover.

81
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,300
今天肯定会让你觉得特别激动人心  莉莉
This is a really exciting time for you, Lily.

82
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,440
这是你第一次体验到女权
This is your first taste of feminism.

83
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,420
我们在座的都是你的良师益友
We're all here as your mentors --

84
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,870
或者说"娘师益友"
or "Womentors".

85
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,960
给点反应  我刚发明的新词
Come on, I just coined that.

86
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,880
你说"如英雌一般"时我们假笑过了
We fake-laughed at "Sheroic."

87
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,980
实在没心情配合你了
The well is dry.

88
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,090
这车堵得太荒唐了
This stupid traffic!

89
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,000
看看这么多的女司机  莉莉
Look at all these women in these cars, Lily.

90
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,620
多激励人心啊
It's so inspiring.

91
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,800
人人为我
All for one!

92
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,400
-我为人人  -我走小路绕过这些白痴
- One for all -- - I am gonna cut around these idiots!

93
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,170
那是什么声音
What was that?

94
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,060
有人开枪把车胎射爆了
Somebody shot out the tire!

95
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,960
不是吧  你第一个想到的就是这个吗
Really? That's where you go with this?

96
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,140
分明是路面上的坑
It was a pothole.

97
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,220
仪表盘开始乱闪了
The dashboard is going crazy.

98
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,500
车胎瘪了  "太好了"
It's a flat tire. Perfect.

99
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,440
我这种有胸的人不知道"瘪"是什么意思
I wouldn't know about "flat."

100
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,960
菲尔  菲尔
Phil! Phil!

101
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,220
咱有麻烦了
We have a problem.

102
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,980
"咱"吗
"We"?

103
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,690
我想去那家卖熊爪包的面包房
I'm trying to get to that bakery that makes those bear claws.

104
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,230
你和你的破硬币雇的那个话唠
That chatterbox you and your coin hired

105
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,960
害我们停车场排起了长队
is clogging up our parking lot.

106
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,780
太好了  又损失八美元
Oh, great. There goes eight bucks.

107
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,690
这是正式的合伙人会议吗
Is this an official partners' meeting?

108
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,580
等一下
Hold on.

109
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,790
早上好  欢迎
Good morning and welcome.

110
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,780
目前在场的合伙人有
Partners present --

111
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,220
菲尔·邓菲  把你那个白痴本子放下
Phil Dunphy -- Put down your stupid notebook.

112
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,820
是你想雇她的
You're the one who wanted to hire her.

113
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,280
你得告诉她要么提高效率要么走人
You've got to tell her to speed it up or hit the road.

114
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,920
我想让您知道您的问题我都清楚了
I want you to know that I hear you

115
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,120
我会尽快处理
and will address this posthaste.

116
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,740
现在  不如我们谈一谈上次会议中
Now, if we could move on to some unfinished business

117
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,920
没有谈完的问题
from the last meeting, um...

118
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,820
"我的感情仍然很受伤
"My feelings are still hurt

119
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
因为听你对我说了
from you telling me

120
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,980
你想让我把硬币塞到哪些糟糕的地方去"
all the places you want me to put the coin."

121
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,630
都十点多了
Ah, it's after ten o'clock --

122
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,130
这个时候吃熊爪包太晚了
too late to eat a bear claw now.

123
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,510
吃那么多糖我会兴奋得睡不着午觉的
I'll be too sugared up for my nap.

124
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,550
一切都毁了
Everything's ruined!

125
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,810
看来你在忙
Hey. You look busy.

126
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,240
我不过是最后点缀一下
Oh, yeah, well, I'm just putting the finishing touches

127
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,670
今年校园音乐剧要穿的戏服
on the costumes for this year's school musical.

128
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,240
是那部你声称根据你的人生故事改编
You mean the one that's supposedly based on your life,

129
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,430
但一词一曲都照抄《绿野仙踪》的音乐剧吗
but is a beat-for-beat rip-off of "The Wizard of Oz"?

130
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,480
我的故事讲的是一个早熟的农场小子
Mine is the story of a precocious farm kid

131
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,830
踏上一段魔幻旅程去大城市冒险
who takes a magical journey to the big city.

132
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,790
哪里抄《绿野仙踪》了
How is that "Wizard of Oz"?

133
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,310
小卡  你的故事里也有个铁皮人
Cam, you have a Tin Man.

134
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,140
{\an8}绿野仙踪是讲一个小女孩去魔幻国度
与稻草人  狮子  铁皮人一同冒险的故事

135
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,820
那是我们高中的吉祥物
That's our high-school mascot.

136
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,140
我们的吉祥物是神力奶壶
We were the Mighty Milk Jugs.

137
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,100
你知道的
You know this.

138
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,760
帕姆
Hi, Pam.

139
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,110
二位
Hey, y'all.

140
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,620
听着  楼上的厨房里...
Listen, upstairs in the kitchen...

141
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,840
有没有...
is there, um...

142
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,300
那个什么...
one of those, uh...

143
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,260
就是那个什么...
you know, things that, uh...

144
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,070
等等  你刚刚问我什么来着
Wait, what were you asking me?

145
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,440
帕姆  你还好吗
Pam, are-are you okay?

146
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,780
妹子  你看起来累坏了
Oh, honey, you look exhausted.

147
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,980
宝宝昨晚又闹了一整晚
The baby didn't sleep again last night.

148
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,760
跟你说  自从咱家被龙卷风卷飞以来
I'll tell you, I haven't been this out of sorts

149
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,610
我还是第一次累成这幅德行
since that twister lifted up our house.

150
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,280
这回信我了吧
Told ya.

151
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,450
那次龙卷风特别厉害
That wind was so strong

152
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,200
把我们所有的玉米粒都剥光了
it shucked all our corn.

153
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,620
就像...  每次...
‭It was like... whenev--

154
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,670
-她睡着了吗  -别担心  她没事
- She sleeping? - No, she's fine.

155
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,960
我们家犁地的马以前也总这样
Our plough horse used to do the same thing.

156
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,040
宝宝哭了
Baby's crying.

157
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,340
不如我停一停手里的活
Why don't I put this on pause.

158
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,280
上楼去帮你一把
I'll come up and help you out for a little bit.

159
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,190
还是让米奇尔来帮忙吧
Oh, maybe Mitchell should help.

160
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,760
他特别会安抚小卡尔霍恩
He's just so good with baby Calhoun.

161
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,380
我该叫你"抱小孩魔手舅舅"
Aww. ‭I ought to call you "Uncle Secret Touch".

162
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,000
这昵称听起来有点像
That seems like a

163
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,230
"法律规定不准接近儿童公园"的那种人
"500 feet away from a playground" kind of nickname.

164
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,680
不过我很愿意帮忙
But I will be happy to help.

165
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,300
那好  我就在这待着以防没人找我帮忙
Okay, well, I'll just be down here, in case nobody needs me.

166
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,420
不如你先上楼
Hey, wh-why don't you head upstairs.

167
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,720
我马上就上去  好吗
I-I'll be right up, okay?

168
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,690
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

169
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,960
你总是想把自己这一面藏起来
You know, you try to hide it,

170
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,500
但你这人特别多愁善感
but you are a sensitive soul...

171
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,740
"偷偷有感觉[摸]舅舅"
"Uncle Sneaky Feeler."

172
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,370
我们把这昵称传出去前再商量商...
Yeah, before we go wide with that, let's, um --

173
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,110
别  好吧
not. Okay.

174
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,910
小卡
Cam.

175
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,910
怎么  我觉得他叫你去帮忙照顾小卡尔
What? I think it's great that she's asking you

176
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,480
而不找我这个血亲
to help out with baby Cal

177
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,500
是件很好的事
instead of his own flesh and blood.

178
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,070
看来她只有在让我戴假发
I guess the only thing I'm good for

179
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,840
替考她的SAT时才会想到我
is putting on a wig and taking her SATs.

180
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,710
我真不敢相信你居然会嫉妒
I cannot believe you're jealous.

181
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,970
我才没嫉妒  我忙得很
I'm hardly jealous. I'm much too busy.

182
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,670
忙着做完飞猴的戏服吗
Oh, finishing the flying monkeys?

183
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,870
{\an8}在绿野仙踪里有出现

184
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,870
它们不是飞猴
They're not flying monkeys.

185
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
我问问你  你觉得负鼠被龙卷风卷起来后
Let me ask you -- what do you think happens

186
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,060
会变成什么样
to possums during a tornado?

187
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,840
停到那边那辆别克旁边
Park it over there, next to that Buick.

188
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,190
看看谁来了
There he is.

189
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,990
琼  今天这儿怎么样啊
Hey, Joan. How's everything down here today?

190
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,100
我让车辆入位  人们面露微笑
Putting cars in spaces and smiles on faces.

191
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,220
除了还没让你微笑
Well, except for yours.

192
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,070
怎么了
What's wrong?

193
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,990
没事  很好  没错  真的很好
Oh, no, I'm good. Yeah, definitely good.

194
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,300
菲尔  我最懂的两件事
Phil...if there's two things I know,

195
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,150
就是人和停车
it's people and parking.

196
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,540
你看起来像遭遇了困境
And you look like you trying to get out of a tough spot.

197
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,810
被你一眼看穿了
You see right through me.

198
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,440
我们的合伙人会议上有个问题
There was an issue at our partners' meeting.

199
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,500
等一下
Hold on one second.

200
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,120
亲爱的
Hey, sugar!

201
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,080
亲  工作派对怎么样
All right, girl, how was the office party?

202
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,910
这次我一直穿着衣服呢
I kept all my clothes on this time.

203
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,990
你是对的
And you were right --

204
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,710
远离混酒  宿醉全无
I stayed away from mixers and I'm not hungover!

205
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:01,470
是吧
See?!

206
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,390
没有酒就不会输
You can't lose if it's nothing but booze.

207
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,570
这值得来一发
That deserves...

208
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,360
彩纸屑炸弹
confetti bomb!

209
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,720
你人最好了
You're the greatest.

210
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,930
在那个蓝色丰田旁边停车
Park it over there by that blue Toyota.

211
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,610
好样的
My girl!

212
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,520
她是个小酒鬼
She is a bit of a drinker,

213
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,230
所以我总给她很大空间
so I like to give her a lot of space.

214
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,100
好啦
All right.

215
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,680
你要说什么
Now, what did you want to talk about?

216
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
没什么
Nothing.

217
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,520
这一切都很完美
Everything here is perfect.

218
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,840
-接近完美  -你想到什么吗
- Well, almost. ‭- Something on your mind?

219
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,180
没什么  不过一整天
No, but something is on my feet

220
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,920
我的脚上都有东西  我自己
all day -- me.

221
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,630
收费亭加个橡胶垫怎么样
How 'bout...a gel mat for the booth?

222
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,060
我会给你装个垫子
Oh, I'm getting you a mat...

223
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,880
因为你太棒了
'cause you're all that.

224
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,520
我好喜欢
I love that!

225
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,140
彩纸屑炸弹
Confetti bomb! ‭

226
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,080
我不是在检查他的工作
It wasn't like I was checking up on him.

227
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,540
我午休后来吃午后熊爪包  经过这儿
I had my nap and I came by for an afternoon claw.

228
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,940
我现在没啥事干了
I don't have a lot going on right now.

229
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,540
我觉得是这个
I think it's this one.

230
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,110
亲们  咱们打电话给道路救援吧
Hey, guys, why don't we just call roadside assistance?

231
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,500
我想他们会派个人过来的
I'm sure they'll send somebody.

232
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,580
如果今天是为了女人力量而出来
If today is all about girl power,

233
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,670
我们为什么不自己修好
why can't we just fix it ourselves?

234
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:04,860
我就知道我们不该带她
I knew we shouldn't have brought her.

235
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,220
真有意思
It's funny --

236
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,640
我们在女性示威游行做志愿者
we've only been volunteering here

237
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,750
-只有一个小时  -五分钟
- at the women's march for an hour... - Five minutes.

238
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,660
但我已经感觉我是
...but it already feels like I'm part of something big,

239
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,100
这个盛大又特别的活动的一部分
something really special.

240
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,970
你能给我拍张照片吗
Would you snap a picture?

241
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,970
这样你就能证明你有来  然后拿到学分
So you can prove you were here and get school credit,

242
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,410
在你的海报上拼错的字母干了之前
and be home faster than the ink dries

243
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,150
你就可以回家了
on that poster you just misspelled?

244
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,320
女性解衣[联合]
"Women Untie"?

245
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,450
拼错也通啊
Still works.

246
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,670
卢克  这些女性值得我们的尊重
Luke, these women deserve our respect.

247
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,580
她们要克服
They've had to overcome

248
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,880
我们无需面对的偏见和挑战
biases and challenges we've never had to face.

249
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,920
她们是女性选举权运动人士的后代
They're the granddaughters of the suffrage movement.

250
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,460
坐等你的小演讲结束
Sitting through your little speech...

251
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,490
也是种折磨[选举权]
that's suffrage.

252
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,750
天啊
Oh, my God.

253
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,770
那是微积分课上的丹妮尔·帕尔多
I-It's Danielle Pardo from calculus.

254
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,160
-谁  -你不会认识她的
- Who? - ‭You wouldn't know her.

255
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,550
你们在不同的圈子
You run in different circles.

256
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,690
她在荣誉尖子班  而你
She's in honors classes and you, well,

257
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,590
只是在兜圈子
run in circles.

258
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,100
曼尼
Hey, Manny!

259
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,710
很高兴看到你在这
It's so cool you're here.

260
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,660
我也在这  卢克·邓菲
And I'm here, too -- Luke Dunphy.

261
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,400
你现在看到我
You saw me now

262
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,320
一直到游行结束时你也会看到我
and you saw me at the end of the march.

263
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,120
如果你们在做牌子
If you guys are making signs,

264
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,380
我有些议题
here are some of the issues --

265
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,070
1块钱的活儿  女性只能赚到79美分
women make 79 cents on the dollar,

266
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,600
还有  女性能不能打胎居然是政府来决定
and the government wants to tell me what I can do with my body.

267
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,130
你如果是你  你什么感受
I mean, how would you feel if --

268
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,900
她让我太震惊了
She blew my mind.

269
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,210
社会把女性当成二等公民对待
Society treats girls like second-class citizens.

270
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,620
我在"女性网站"上花了很多时间
I've spent a lot of time on women's websites,

271
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,540
但从没见过这些信息
but none of this stuff ever came up.

272
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,530
莉莉  你看  强大的女子在行动
You're watching strong women in action, Lily.

273
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,980
当我们一起动脑
When we put our minds together,

274
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,750
没有什么是我们做不到的
there's nothing we can't achieve.

275
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,170
这太难了
This is too hard.

276
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,630
我放弃
Ugh. I give up.

277
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,770
看下说明书吧
Let's just get the manual.

278
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,050
好主意  我喜欢
Great idea. I like that.

279
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,020
莉莉  这不是童话故事
You see, Lily, there are no fairy tales,

280
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,720
没有等待拯救的女子
no damsels in distress.

281
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,120
我们有的可不止
We are more than just a bunch

282
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,470
漂亮脸蛋
of pretty faces.

283
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,950
工作箱里除了化妆品  啥也没有
There's nothing in the glove box but makeup.

284
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,860
不错  因为放了说明书
Ay, yeah, because the manual wouldn't fit

285
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,460
我的紧急补妆箱就放不下了
with my emergency touch-up kit.

286
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,480
我想再次建议
I would like to revisit

287
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,470
歌洛莉亚的提议  放弃
Gloria's idea about giving up.

288
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,390
那可真是积极的榜样
Oh, that's setting a great example.

289
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,130
如果当年居里夫人放弃研究
What do you think would've happened

290
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,520
你觉得会发生什么事
if Marie Curie had given up?

291
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,730
她就不会死于辐射中毒
She wouldn't have died of radiation poisoning.

292
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,170
你怎么会知道这个的
How on Earth did you know that?

293
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,340
你总是提她
You talk about her a lot.

294
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,660
直到我在一张邮票上看到她之前
Until I saw her on that stamp,

295
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,060
我以为她是你女朋友
I thought she was your girlfriend.

296
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,840
歌洛莉亚  我不敢相信你不知道怎么换轮胎
Gloria, I can't believe you don't know how to change a tire.

297
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,710
你之前是出租车司机  你肯定遇过爆胎吧
You drove a taxi. Surely you had a flat.

298
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,320
我遇过很多次爆胎
I had a lot of flats,

299
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,510
但我就再化化妆  然后等一会
but I would reapply my makeup and I would wait and then,

300
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,920
五分钟之内  就会有一队的男人替我换了
in five minutes, I would have my own pit crew.

301
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,210
我们换好这个轮胎后
You know, after we get this tire changed,

302
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,150
你是还想去游行
do you still want to go to the rally

303
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,370
还是我们该把你丢去旧社会
or should we just drop you off in 1950?

304
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,090
亲们  那里...
Uh, guys, there's, uh...

305
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,010
需要帮忙换胎吗
You need help with that tire?

306
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,640
不不  我们不用  我们很好  谢谢
No. ‭No. No, we don't. We're good, thanks.

307
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,860
你们在说什么
What are you guys talking about?

308
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,490
她是个女的  她想帮我们换轮胎
She's a woman and she wants to help with the tire.

309
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,020
所有条件都符合啊
She checks all the boxes.

310
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,310
好吧
Right. Um...

311
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,650
你好
Hello.

312
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,780
我们想换轮胎
Uh, we were trying to change our tire,

313
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,470
但千斤顶出了点问题
but there's something wrong with the jack.

314
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,940
让我看看
Let me check it out.

315
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,960
那个呀
Uh-huh. Oh, that.

316
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,970
好了
Okay. ‭There we go.

317
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,530
应该动那个
...should have moved that one.

318
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,880
你被雇佣了
You're hired.

319
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,860
太好了  来把这车撑起来吧
Great. Let's get this baby off the ground.

320
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,060
我叫乔伊

我才是你的亲舅舅  而不是米奇尔

这位暴躁女王的戏码一点都不好看
It's no fun watching this angry queen.

376
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,790
我真是不敢相信
I can't believe you.

377
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,040

We have a very special relationship --

385
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,900
有点像女王和她的私人秘书那样
kind of like the one the queen had with her private secretary.

386
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,230
你个爱剧透的贱人
You son of a bitch!

387

I know. I hear the way Mr. Easton "mansplains" everything to you.

396
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,990
-那是什么  -是指男性给女性
- What's that? - It's when a man tries to

解释她本已知道的事情

398

你是在男解"男解"给我听吗
Are you mansplaining "mansplaining" to me right now?

399
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,240
我问的是你手上的零食
I was talking about your snack.

这是什锦果仁[先河]
It's trail mix.

401

你本该跟她讲清楚  但你没有
You were supposed to handle it, but you didn't,

407

所以我百忙之中抽空过来
so I had to take time out of my extremely busy day

408
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,660
想跟她说清楚
and try to straighten her out.

409

但她不肯按我说的去做  所以只能请她走了
But she didn't go along with the program, so she's gone.

410

你没跟我商量就把她赶走了
You did this without talking to me?

411
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,800
我们不是一起做决定的搭档吗
We're supposed to be partners.

412
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,280
我们会请那个叫蒂伯的
We're gonna hire that Tibor guy.

413
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,060

He barely speaks English, but there'll be no chattiness --

414
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,110
虽然我也试过对歌洛莉亚用这招
although I did try that with Gloria,

415
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,590
但他们最终还是会通过看大量电视学会讲英语

There's no line, and Joan never had this many cars in the lot.

418
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,150
大家都喜欢她  她很擅长这份工作
People liked her! She was good at this!

419
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,210
淡定  只是停车而已  不像造衣柜那么难
Relax. This is parking cars, not building closets.

420
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,180
不好意思
Excuse me?

421
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,400
我的车子被四辆车挡住了  出不来
There's like four cars blocking me in.

422

我马上帮你移走

426
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,370

Here, stand on this.

427

你可能要在这儿等很久
You might be here for a while.

小帕
Pam?

430
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,010
好了
Hey -- okay.

431
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,560
我们到床上去睡
L-Let's go to bed.

432
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,510
我不累
No. I'm not tired.

433
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,400
不  你脖子和肩膀老是酸痛
No, this is why your neck and shoulders always hurt,

434
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,730
就是因为你总是不躺着睡
'cause you're falling asleep standing up.

435
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,960
来  我扶你到床上
Come on, let's get you to bed.

436
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,010

苍天啊

谁开丰田普锐斯
Who drives the Prius?

444
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,920
钥匙上串着超市积分卡
With a "Whole Foods" reward card?

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,060
琼人呢  我得赶紧取车
Where's Joan? I need my car.

446

没事了  我把琼请回来了
Everything's fine. I've rehired Joan.

449
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,840
我们不需要她
We don't need her.

450
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,590
谁的车钥匙是银色的

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,290
菲尔  到底要不要我出马
Phil, am I doing this or not?

452
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:24,200
琼  停车场就交给你了
Joan, the lot is yours.

你不能单方面重新雇用她  菲尔
You cannot unilaterally rehire her, Phil.

456
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,120
就像你不问过我就把她炒掉一样吗
You mean like how you fired her without talking to me?

457
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,260
如果我们有异议
If we disagree about something,

458
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,690
就该通过掷硬币来做决定
we're supposed to flip over it!

459
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,290
也许我们该掷硬币看看  还要不要继续合作
Maybe we should flip over whether we should even be partners.

460
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,440
-也许我们现在就该掷  -很好

如果是杰那面  我们终止合作

你们两个傻子在干什么
What are you two fools doing?

464
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,930
我们合作不来
This isn't working out.

465
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,980
合作愉快的前提是
And it's not gonna

你以为自己是了不起的大老板
You think you're some big-shot boss

468
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,110
可以肆意欺负他
and you can just push him around.

469
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,970
-谢谢你  琼  -闭嘴
- Thank you, Joan. - ‭Zip it!

470
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,290
你任由他欺负你
You let him do it.

471
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,490
帮你自己个忙
Do yourself a favor --

472
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,790
向杰学习学习  比如如何强硬点
learn something from Jay, like how to be tough.

473
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,640
你们才不需要这个破硬币
You guys don't need a stupid coin.

474
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,650
你们只需要彼此
You need each other.

475
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,910
现在  说点好听的
Now...say something nice.

476
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,790
我一直  一直很欣赏你的霸气
I always -- I always have admired your toughness.

477
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,060
好了  该你了
All right. Your turn.

478
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,160
我一直觉得你很...
I always thought you were...

479
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,330
快乐
...happy.

480
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,170
看见没
See?

481
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,680
这才是撒彩纸屑的正确方式
And that is how you do that.

482
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,880
你回来了
Oh. Hey, there you are.

483
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,190
是我错了
Listen, it was wrong of me

484
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,840
说你跟小帕之间
to say something weird was going on

485
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,370
有些不寻常的关系
between you and Pameron.

486
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,400
我脑子肯定哪里抽风了
I don't know what I was thinking.

487
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,830
你们俩很明显有着完美正常的
Clearly, you guys have a perfectly normal

488
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,610
姐姐与同性恋弟媳的关系
sister- and gay-brother -in-law relationship.

489
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,250
你在宝宝监视器上看到了是吧
You saw it on the baby monitor, didn't you?

490
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,540
在夜视画面里看更显诡异
It was even creepier in night vision.

491
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,490
我也一脸懵逼啊
I don't know what happened.

492
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,100
你们俩有着一样的香唇  而且...
Y-You both have the same lips and --

493
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,520
一样的吻法...
and you kiss the same and --

494
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,610
我们对同一根篱笆支柱练的吻技
We did learn to kiss on the same hedge post.

495
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,170
米奇尔  能借一步说话吗
Mitchell, could I speak to you in private, please?

496
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,170
怎么  你还想再来几发拥颈亲热吗
Why? Do you want to do some more neckin'?

497
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,760
你还四处炫耀了吗
You were bragging on it?!

498
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,070
他从婴儿监视器上看到的
He saw it on the baby monitor.

499
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,020
你还偷看  你个淫虫蛤蟆
And you were watching, you horny toad?

500
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,300
小帕  冷静
Pam, let's calm down.

501
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,140
你这样是在给自己找难堪
You're kind of embarrassing yourself.

502
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,550
我知道
I know!

503
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,530
我就是一团乱
I'm such a mess!

504
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,640
我好累啊
I'm just so tired!

505
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:26,220
而且我看着女皇的马交配那一幕到睡着
Plus, I fell asleep to the scene of the queen's horses doin' it!

506
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,690
-喂喂喂  别剧透啊  -没什...
- Hello? Spoiler alert. - It's just...

507
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,450
对不起我给你们增加负担了
I'm sorry if I've been such a burden.

508
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,000
-没有  你才不是负担  -没有  你不是
- No, you're not a burden. ‭- No, no, you're not a burden.

509
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,210
起来  听我说
No, come on, listen --

510
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,700
说实话  其实我挺享受
the truth is, I've kind of enjoyed

511
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,390
当一个宝宝的超厉害爸爸
being super-daddy to a baby,

512
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,810
因为我从没体验过这感觉
you know, 'cause I've never had that.

513
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,120
你说什么呢  你当时也很会照顾莉莉啊
Oh, what are you talking about? You were great with Lily.

514
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,640
不  是你很会照顾莉莉
No, you were great with Lily.

515
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,960
而一开始时  我...
In the beginning, I...

516
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,720
我也是一窍不通  所以我都让你主导
I was a mess, so I let you take the lead.

517
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,000
我也说不上  或许我只是
I don't know, m-maybe I'm just

518
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,890
想证明点什么给自己看吧
trying to prove something to myself.

519
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,140
亲爱的  我不知道你有这想法
Oh, sweetie, I had no idea.

520
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,390
但你真的不需要证明什么
But you don't have anything to prove

521
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,920
因为你已经是很棒的父亲了
because you're a great dad.

522
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,710
你们俩都是
You both are...

523
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,680
但我真是烂透了
but I'm a disaster.

524
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,530
别  白沙发  起来吧
No, white couch. Let's get you up.

525
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,750
我觉得光靠我一个人照顾不来啊
I don't think I can do all this by myself.

526
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,010
那有个好消息就是
Well, you know what, the good news is,

527
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,060
你不需要一个人照顾
is you don't have to do any of this all by yourself,

528
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,240
因为你的楼下有爱你的家人
because you have a family right down here who loves you

529
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,910
会愿意为你做任何事来帮助你
and will do anything we need to do to help you.

530
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,480
太好了  这对我太意义非凡了
Good. That means the world to me.

531
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,760
而且...  我知道这哭声的意思
And besides... I know that cry,

532
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,740
这尿片我不去换
and somebody else is changing that diaper.

533
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,600
-我不去  -我不去
- Not it. - Not it.

534
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,680
所以女人怎么都输啊
So, women can't win.

535
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,120
女人去工作要受不公平对待
They're penalized if they work

536
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,890
而在家当家庭妇女也一样
and they're penalized if they stay home.

537
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,020
没错
Exactly!

538
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,140
卢克  在我今早起床
You know, Luke, when I woke up this morning

539
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,400
来到这场游行前
and came to the rally...

540
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,310
我从没想过我会遇到像你这样的人
I never thought I would meet somebody like you.

541
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,830
轮到你了
You're up!

542
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,560
到我了
It's my turn.

543
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,330
真不敢相信她会信你的烂招
I can't believe she's falling for this.

544
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,330
我这一生都支持女权
I've believed in this cause my whole life.

545
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,570
而你只花一个下午来假装一下
You spend an afternoon faking it

546
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,280
她就亲到你嘴唇边上了
and she kisses you almost on the lips.

547
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,730
我才没有假装什么
I'm not faking anything.

548
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,150
她打动了我
She got through to me.

549
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,810
女人  女孩  以及支持我们的男性
Women and girls and the men who honor us...

550
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,740
我国女人所要遭受的不公简直就是犯罪
It's a crime what women in this country have to go through,

551
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,000
我全心全意支持她
and I'm with her 100%.

552
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,680
不作出牺牲  就永远成不了大事
We will never accomplish anything without sacrifice.

553
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,780
没错
Damn straight!

554
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,380
对不起  我也不是故意要这样
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to happen, but...

555
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,860
但我跟丹妮尔真的是心灵相通
Danielle and I made a connection

556
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,670
无论要多久  我都会在她身旁支持她
and I'm sticking with her as long as it takes.

557
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,630
所以在女人得到真正的平等之前
That's why, until women have true equality,

558
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,490
我决定当独身禁欲者
I will remain celibate.

559
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,590
咱们走人吧
Let's get out of here.

560
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,880
现在千斤顶放下来了
Now that the jack is lowered

561
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,580
螺母也都拧上
and all the lug nuts are snug,

562
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,880
就只差交叉把它们都拧紧了
you just got to tighten everything in a cross pattern.

563
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,860
何不你们一人来拧一个呢
Why don't you each do one?

564
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,370
如果可以的话  我不想身上沾到油污
If it's okay, I'd rather not get grease all over me.

565
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,000
要想改变世界
Hey, you can't change the world

566
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,430
必定满手泥泞
without getting your hands dirty.

567
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,250
好吧  给我
Okay. Give me that.

568
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,390
你说得真对
You're right.

569
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,970
这感觉好棒
This is great.

570
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,380
感觉我无所不能
It feels like I can do anything.

571
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,560
你这是在转松
You're loosening it.

572
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,840
不好意思  对不起
Oh. Oh, sorry.

573
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,370
谢谢你  乔伊
Thank you, Joey.

574
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,510
你换胎的速度好快
You did that so fast.

575
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,970
车子是我血液里的一部分
Well, cars are in my blood.

576
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,230
我的奶奶自己开了一家修车厂
You know, my grandmother ran her own garage.

577
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,620
太厉害了
Huh. That's so awesome.

578
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,360
在那种年代一定有各种偏见
There must have been a lot of prejudice back then.

579
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,140
的确  但后来呢
There was... but eventually,

580
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,250
她还是帮忙爱尔兰佬修车了
she started fixing Irish people's cars.

581
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,520
莉莉  你去把剩下的转紧吧
Well, uh, Lily, why don't you finish it off.

582
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,820
我不够力气
I'm not strong enough.

583
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,260
我来帮你
Well, then let me help you.

584
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,940
我们联手力气更大
We're stronger together.

585
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,730
我们联合的确更强大
Wow. We are stronger together.

586
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,800
对不起我之前看轻你
Oh, I'm sorry I put you down before.

587
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,930
你是个很强大的女人  歌洛莉亚
You are a formidable woman, Gloria.

588
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:26,990
你值得受人尊敬
You deserve respect.

589
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,400
不  克莱尔  你才值得受人敬重
No, Claire, you are the one that deserves respect.

590
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,950
你养大了三个很棒的孩子  经营了一家公司
You have raised three wonderful children, you run a company,

591
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,610
不浪费时间在鸡毛蒜皮的小事
you don't waste time on silly things like...

592
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,300
比如搞发型之类的
the way your hair looks.

593
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,940
你会把该做的事都做好
You just get things done.

594
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,580
这样就好了  你们能重新上路了
And that is it. You guys are all set.

595
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,450
真的很谢谢你
Thank you so much. 

596
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,090
有什么方法可以报答你吗
Is there any way we could pay you for your time?

597
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,790
不用不用  真的不必
No, no, absolutely not.

598
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,950
我很乐意帮忙
I'm happy to help.

599
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,750
让我帮忙你们重置胎压检测系统
But let me just reset your tire-pressure monitor

600
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,930
这样它才不会一直发出警示音
so that thing doesn't beep at you all day.

601
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,440
好的  去吧  劳烦你了
Yes, please. Go right ahead.

602
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,250
看到了吗  莉莉
See that, Lily?

603
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,760
我们不需要男人来解救我们
We didn't need a man to help us get out of this.

604
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,190
当女人对别的女人伸出援手时就是这样
This is what happens when women help other women.

605
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,310
她应该只是确定一下有没有修好吧
She's probably just making sure it works, right?

606
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,780
那个贱人偷走了我的车
So that bitch stole my car.

607
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,270
往好的方面看  看到一名女性打入
On a positive note, it is nice to see a woman

608
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,250
曾是男性主导的行业领域也很棒
break into a previously male-dominated field.

609
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
我的化妆品不在保险里
My makeup was not insured.

610
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,110
这是完美解决方法啊
It's the perfect solution.

611
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,370
我们不能就做个决定就行了吗
Can't we just make an decision?

612
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,370
怎么了
What's going on?

613
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,120
你爸跟我在争一件事
Oh, your father and I have been arguing about something 

614
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,950
争了一个多小时了
for over an hour.

615
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,410
幸好  我做了个特别的硬币
Fortunately, I've made a special coin

616
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,610
一面是我的脸  一面是你妈的脸
with my face on one side and your mom's on the other.

617
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,920
像女权斗士纪念币的丑版
Ugh, Susan B. Unflattering.

618
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,220
好的  来吧
Okay, here we go.

619
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,940

- It came up Claire. - Yep!

620
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,750
以后火葬
Getting cremated!

621
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,520
靠
Damn it!

622
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,640
好的  还有一题
Okay, here's another one...

623
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,960
我那面  我们用储备金买海边公寓
my head, we use our nest egg for a beach condo.

624
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,130
你那面  就留给孩子当应急金
Yours, the kids' safety net.

625
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,230
干嘛这样
Hey, not cool.

626
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,000
抱歉啦  孩子们
I'm so sorry, you guys.

627
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,220

Aw, you can come visit.

628
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,400
前提是你们有钱来
You know, if you can afford it.
