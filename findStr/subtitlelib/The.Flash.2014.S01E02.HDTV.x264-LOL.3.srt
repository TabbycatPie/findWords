1
00:00:01,393 --> 00:00:03,360
My name is Barry Allen.

2
00:00:03,362 --> 00:00:05,762
I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:05,764 --> 00:00:07,397
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

4
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,132
I saw a ball of lightning.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,401
Inside the lightning there was a man.

6
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:12,769
He killed my mom.

7
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:14,438
I swear to god I didn't do this.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,139
- Where's mom?
- What happened that night

9
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,541
was impossible.

10
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:20,043
Then an accident made me the impossible.

11
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:23,280
You were in a coma.

12
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,348
- For how long?
- Nine months.

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,217
Your muscles should be atrophied,

14
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:28,785
but instead they're in a state
of cellular regeneration.

15
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:31,021
I wasn't the only one affected, was I?

16
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:35,192
We've been searching for
other meta humans like yourself.

17
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:37,194
All my life I've wanted to do more.

18
00:00:37,196 --> 00:00:40,063
And the first chance I get
to help someone, I screw up.

19
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:42,432
The good you do must far outweigh the bad.

20
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:44,568
You're not gonna be in here much longer.

21
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,204
Whoever killed mom,
I think I finally have a way

22
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:48,538
to find them.

23
00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:53,076
This is the part where
I'm supposed to do the whole

24
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:54,411
intro thingy.

25
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:56,179
Barry Allen, fastest man alive...

26
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,614
But you know all that already.

27
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:59,216
All right, let's get to the good stuff.

28
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:00,884
You see that smoke? That's a fire

29
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:04,254
on Western and 3rd
in downtown Central City.

30
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,990
And that blur? That's me on my way to it.

31
00:01:06,992 --> 00:01:09,759
I'm going 352 miles an hour.

32
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,362
And it's a slow day.

33
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,763
This is Ladder 52.

34
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:15,265
We're still at least two minutes out.

35
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:16,600
People are gonna die in there.

36
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:19,169
I know.

37
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,004
Barry?

38
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:23,974
Barry!

39
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:25,242
What? Did I miss it?

40
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:27,477
You overshot by about six blocks.

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,514
My bad.

42
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:31,948
Paige!

43
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,184
My daughter! Has anyone seen my daughter?

44
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:37,087
Paige! Whoa!

45
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:39,322
You there yet?

46
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:42,325
What are you doing?

47
00:01:42,327 --> 00:01:43,426
Nothing.

48
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:45,028
Who were you talking to?

49
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,263
- No one.
- Are you talking to Barry?

50
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:47,998
- Who?
- Barry Allen?

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,966
Struck by lighting?
Was in a coma for nine months?

52
00:01:49,968 --> 00:01:52,502
Woke up being able to run
faster than the speed of sound?

53
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:53,770
- Ring a bell?
- No.

54
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:55,205
Haven't talked to him.

55
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,007
Cisco, there's fire everywhere!

56
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,910
Cisco, are you still there?

57
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:01,278
Mom?

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,246
Mommy!

59
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:11,021
- Whoa!
- Mommy!

60
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,597
Everybody's out.

61
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,165
What else you got for me, Cisco?

62
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,834
Barry, it's Caitlin.

63
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:28,171
Hey, Caitlin.

64
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:29,506
How's your day?

65
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:32,676
Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs. Now.

66
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:34,144
On my way.

67
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:39,182
Oh.

68
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,520
Have you both lost your minds?

69
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,322
Who do you think you are?

70
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:47,691
Well, I'm the eyes and ears,
and he's the feet.

71
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:48,992
This isn't funny.

72
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,061
You could have gotten yourself killed.

73
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:52,596
You can't be running around the city

74
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:53,697
like some supersonic fireman.

75
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:55,532
Why not?

76
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,001
This is what we talked about:
Me using my speed to do good.

77
00:02:58,003 --> 00:03:00,170
We talked about you helping us contain

78
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:01,605
other people who might have been affected

79
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:03,273
by the particle accelerator explosion.

80
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:04,941
Meta-humans.

81
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:07,744
And aside from Clyde Mardon,
we haven't found any.

82
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:09,713
People in this city still need help.

83
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:11,247
And I can help them.

84
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,216
We can help them.

85
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:15,051
Will you please say something?

86
00:03:15,053 --> 00:03:16,653
I think what Caitlin is saying,

87
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,155
in her own spectacularly angry way,

88
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,624
is that we are just beginning to understand

89
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:22,392
what your body is capable of.

90
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,961
Not to sound like a broken
record, Mr. Allen...

91
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,963
I do caution restraint.

92
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:28,732
Dr. Wells...

93
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:32,302
I doubt restraint is how you got
to be the man you are today.

94
00:03:32,304 --> 00:03:34,437
In a wheelchair and a pariah.

95
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,309
Lack of restraint
is what made me these things.

96
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:43,113
Know your limits.

97
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:44,714
don't expect me to patch you up

98
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:47,584
every time you break something.

99
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,452
Hey, uh... Anything happen out there today?

100
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:51,221
The sensors in the suit were kicking back

101
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:54,724
some weird telemetry, like your
vitals spiked for a few seconds.

102
00:03:54,726 --> 00:03:56,259
Never felt better.

103
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:02,832
Hey, Joe, everything all right?

104
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:05,201
Great. I got a fresh crime scene...

105
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,469
A dead body...

106
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,138
Detectives interviewing witnesses...

107
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,340
miles of that yellow tape
stretched over everything.

108
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:12,676
I'm only missing one thing.
Can you guess what that is?

109
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:15,178
I'll be right there.

110
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,781
My day job beckons.

111
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:22,185
When do you think he'll realize

112
00:04:22,187 --> 00:04:24,220
he didn't take his clothes?

113
00:04:30,996 --> 00:04:32,295
Hmm.

114
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,733
Perp made off with a bunch of handguns,

115
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,334
at least six Glock 19s

116
00:04:38,336 --> 00:04:41,171
fitted with extra ammunition magazines.

117
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:43,707
Somebody's looking to do
a whole lot of bad.

118
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,442
Hey, sorry I'm late.

119
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:48,378
Doing a little fall shopping, Mr. Allen?

120
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,180
Oh.

121
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:52,048
I was going so fast this
morning, I didn't even notice.

122
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,050
Oh.

123
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:57,020
Yeah.

124
00:04:57,022 --> 00:05:00,023
I downloaded the surveillance
footage off the video camera.

125
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:04,928
Looks like only one perp.

126
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,074
Footage may only show one,
but it was six guys.

127
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,876
Look, the tracks.
They're all crossing each other.

128
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,278
Six sets of footprints. Six guns stolen.

129
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,914
We should be looking for a crew.

130
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,350
Huh... Weird.

131
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:30,286
The shoes, it looks like
they're all the same size.

132
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,255
Men's tens, I'd guess.

133
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:33,590
Just like you, Captain.

134
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:36,593
Not that you're a suspect, sir. I...

135
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,865
Your ability to multi-task
is truly remarkable.

136
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:44,801
The way you can embarrass me,
the Captain, and yourself

137
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,903
- all at the same time.
- Joe, I'm sorry.

138
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:48,538
I'm starting to think "Joe, I'm sorry" is

139
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,407
my actual name considering how
often you say it to me.

140
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,543
I'm dealing with a lot right now.

141
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:55,011
Look, I know you are.

142
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:56,546
Believe me, I'm dealing with it, too.

143
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:59,215
I've always had
a very simple set of beliefs.

144
00:05:59,217 --> 00:06:01,718
Gravity makes things fall.
Water makes things wet.

145
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,586
And up until a few weeks ago, I believed

146
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,421
the fastest man could
run a mile in four minutes.

147
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,090
Not four seconds.

148
00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:08,191
I could do it in three.

149
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,126
Not relevant.

150
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:12,595
You haven't said anything to
Iris about all this, have you?

151
00:06:12,597 --> 00:06:14,631
No, I made you a promise.
I keep my promises.

152
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:16,166
Keep on lying like that.

153
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,134
You're liable to get struck by
lightning again.

154
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:19,636
Get up to the lab.
Start processing the evidence

155
00:06:19,638 --> 00:06:21,638
from the gun store.

156
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:39,022
Hey, Iris.

157
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,857
Did Barry run away again?

158
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,692
Unless that's one of your
homework questions, little lady,

159
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,760
it's none of your business.

160
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:46,029
Go on back to your room.

161
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,263
I want to see my dad.

162
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,032
I already said no, Barry.

163
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,367
He didn't do those things.
He didn't hurt my mom.

164
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,136
I was there that night. I saw.

165
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,804
- There was a man.
- Yeah, I know.

166
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,640
We've gone through this already.

167
00:06:57,642 --> 00:07:01,444
Then why can't I go see him?

168
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:03,513
Because I said so.

169
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:06,049
You're not my father!
You can't tell me what to do!

170
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,318
Right now, I am the only adult
that gives a damn

171
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,554
what happens to you, so yes,
I can tell you what to do.

172
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,722
Now go to your room.

173
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,225
I hate you!

174
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,067
This is all of your fault.

175
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,535
I could have taken European folklore

176
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:01,504
to cover my sociology requirement, but no.

177
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:03,439
You said, "take journalism, Iris."

178
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,974
Reporters have all of the fun."

179
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:07,043
Guess what, Barry?
Reporters have none of the fun.

180
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,078
Journalism is boring. I'm bored.

181
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,748
- I blame you.
- What?

182
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,950
Why are you staring at me like that?

183
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,586
You look really nice.

184
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:17,987
Thanks.

185
00:08:17,989 --> 00:08:20,390
Why don't you look nice?

186
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:22,292
This afternoon? Suit and tie?

187
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,793
The university is giving Simon Stagg...

188
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,662
- Simon Stagg.
- Some big award.

189
00:08:25,664 --> 00:08:27,430
- And you agreed...
- To explain the science stuff

190
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:29,732
for your article.
It's all coming back to me now.

191
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:32,101
How fast can you get home and change?

192
00:08:32,104 --> 00:08:33,970
Uh, pretty fast.

193
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,405
Hey, Allen.

194
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:36,773
Joe asked me to see where you're at

195
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,608
on the evidence
from the gun store shooting.

196
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,742
Oh, hey, Iris.

197
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:41,244
Detective.

198
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,048
Please, guys, uh, just kiss already.

199
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,617
I already know, remember?

200
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,891
Ah. Thanks for being so cool
about this, Barry.

201
00:08:54,893 --> 00:08:57,994
I know it's not easy keeping a big secret.

202
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,963
I'm getting used to it.

203
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,170
I find it quite remarkable,

204
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,372
having once been a timid freshman

205
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:10,606
at Central City University,

206
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:12,608
to be standing before you now,

207
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,377
the regents choice for man of the year.

208
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,213
While I very much appreciate the award,

209
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:18,481
the real honor for me is knowing that

210
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:20,950
my work in organ transference

211
00:09:20,952 --> 00:09:23,319
helps give people a second chance at life.

212
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,888
Thank you all very much for coming.

213
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,859
Okay. All right, first things first...

214
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,327
Simon Stagg's work in cellular cloning

215
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:32,862
has led to huge advancements

216
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,497
in the future of organ replacement...

217
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,032
Are journalists allowed
to drink on the job?

218
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,533
Okay. If you are bored already,

219
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,835
just wait till we get to the science behind

220
00:09:38,837 --> 00:09:41,070
cellular regeneration.

221
00:09:41,072 --> 00:09:42,872
I have missed this, Barry.

222
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,674
I feel like we haven't spent
any quality time together

223
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:46,376
since you woke up from the coma.

224
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,778
Yeah, I've had a crazy few weeks, I know.

225
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,015
I thought maybe you'd been
avoiding me because of Eddie.

226
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:54,350
I know you think it's wrong,
me dating my dad's partner,

227
00:09:54,352 --> 00:09:55,352
- and I just...
- No.

228
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:58,955
That is not it. At all.

229
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,857
Oh! Oh!

230
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:02,358
Mr. Stagg, I was wondering if
I could get a quote from you

231
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,027
for my article. Not now, miss.

232
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:07,497
I'll just make something up.

233
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,365
So... What were you gonna tell me?

234
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:12,001
You looked like
you were about to say something.

235
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:13,736
Yeah...

236
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:17,673
Ah!

237
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:19,942
Quiet down! All of you!

238
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:20,944
Oh, my God.

239
00:10:20,945 --> 00:10:23,312
Quiet!

240
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:24,981
How considerate!

241
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:27,784
You're all wearing your finest jewelry!

242
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:31,821
Almost like you knew
we were coming to rob you!

243
00:10:31,823 --> 00:10:33,823
Now everybody line up!

244
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:41,497
Don't. Don't.

245
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,000
Freeze!

246
00:10:46,904 --> 00:10:48,905
D-d-drop your weapons!

247

248
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,300
Barry.

249
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,935
Barry.

250
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,136
Barry!

251
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,704
I turned around and you were gone.

252
00:11:21,706 --> 00:11:24,707
What happened? Are you okay?

253
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,876
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I...

254
00:11:26,878 --> 00:11:29,045
I went after them to
try and get the plates.

255
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:30,913
- Wha...?
- And I...

256
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,715
I fainted.

257
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:41,390
- Hi.
- Iris.

258
00:11:41,392 --> 00:11:42,458
Where were you?

259
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,759
Dad, go easy.

260
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:45,895
I found him outside. He fainted.

261
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,396
You want me to get you a paramedic, Allen?

262
00:11:47,398 --> 00:11:49,532
No, I'm fine. Thanks, Eddie.

263
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:50,800
I thought I was dead.

264
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:53,069
I saw the gun go off, and then... boom.

265
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:54,837
Suddenly I'm outside.

266
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,006
I have no idea how I got there.

267
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,075
Let me talk to you for a second.

268
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:02,278
Yeah.

269
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,113
You chased those gunmen, didn't you?

270
00:12:04,115 --> 00:12:05,615
Yeah, they must be the same guys

271
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,250
that knocked over the gun shop
earlier today.

272
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:10,286
And what were you going to do
when you caught them?

273
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:11,621
Huh?

274
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:13,156
Ask them nicely to pull over?

275
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:14,991
You're not bulletproof.

276
00:12:14,993 --> 00:12:16,692
Wait. Are you?

277
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,794
- No, but...
- Okay.

278
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:20,096
No more heroics.

279
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:21,631
Chasing bad guys is not your job.

280
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,033
It's mine. You're not a cop.

281
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,668
Promise me.

282
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,203
Promise.

283
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,105
And you know Iris is not stupid.

284
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:32,408
Start making better excuses
than "I fainted."

285
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,509
I...

286
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,311
You lied to us.

287
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:37,580
How could you not tell us you're
experiencing dizzy spells?

288
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,348
We're your doctors.

289
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,250
God knows what's going on inside your body.

290
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,252
Your cells are in a constant state of flux.

291
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:45,955
You could be experiencing
cardiopulmonary failure

292
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:49,158
or a transient ischemic attack.

293
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,360
Mini stroke. Probably not.

294
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:55,131
You of all people should know
that in science, we share.

295
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:57,366
We do not keep secrets.

296
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:00,937
Wow... I haven't seen anyone

297
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:04,373
make her that angry since Ronnie.

298
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,175
Ronnie was Caitlin's fiance?

299
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:08,678
The one that died the night of
the accelerator explosion?

300
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,180
Yeah. He is...

301
00:13:11,182 --> 00:13:13,182
missed.

302
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:14,817
Now...

303
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:17,520
Let's figure out why
this is happening to you.

304
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:20,189
We're all set.

305
00:13:20,191 --> 00:13:22,758
A little padding. Just in case.

306
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,026
Yeah.

307
00:13:28,765 --> 00:13:31,200
You're sure about this, Cisco?

308
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,736
Most home treadmills have a
maximum speed of about

309
00:13:33,738 --> 00:13:35,171
12 miles per hour.

310
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:37,340
This one has been Cisco'ed.

311
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:40,142
Trust me. It can handle your speed.

312
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,044
Okay.

313
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,656
Heart rate, blood pressure,
nerve conduction all normal.

314
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,057
For Barry.

315
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:56,525
Brainwave function within standard limits.

316
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:59,195
I told you the treadmill could take it.

317
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:00,396
Caitlin.

318
00:14:00,398 --> 00:14:02,632
Look at the glucose levels.

319
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,133
Oh, my God. Of course.

320
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,234
- Right?
- It was so obvious.

321
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:06,269
Glucose levels. Barry!

322
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:08,004
We think we know why you keep...

323
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,741
passing out.

324
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,381
Barry!

325
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:40,303
Where's Barry?

326
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:43,105
Taking a shower.

327
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:45,241
At three o'clock in the afternoon?

328
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,476
If I go up those stairs,
am I gonna see Barry Allen?

329
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:50,379
Or are you gonna be grounded
for a week for lying to me?

330
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,747
I'm sorry, Daddy.

331
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,750
But don't worry. I know where he went.

332
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:57,219
Me too.

333
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,231
I passed out again?

334
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,566
Total metabolic failure

335
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:12,835
brought on by acute hypoglycemia.

336
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:14,170
I'm not eating enough.

337
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,204
So an I.V. bag and I'm good to go?

338
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,275
Try 40.

339
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:20,843
Guess you were thirsty.

340
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:22,111
We're gonna need to fashion you a new diet

341
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,779
based on your metabolic changes.

342
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:26,048
I've done a few calculations.
You need to consume

343
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,552
an amount equal to roughly 850 tacos.

344
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,154
Unless we're talking cheese and guac,

345
00:15:32,156 --> 00:15:34,290
which is like a whole other
set of equations.

346
00:15:34,292 --> 00:15:36,292
For Mexican, I recommend Tito's.

347
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,527
On Bruckner Avenue?

348
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:39,695
Best burrito in the city.

349
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:41,163
Detective West.

350
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:44,834
What brings you to S.T.A.R. Labs?

351
00:15:44,836 --> 00:15:46,736
When I couldn't find you at your lab,

352
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,138
I started doing a little research.

353
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,609
Turns out there's been reports
of a red streak around the city,

354
00:15:53,611 --> 00:15:56,679
stopping muggers, rescuing
people from burning buildings.

355
00:15:56,681 --> 00:16:01,384
You didn't tell him
we were working together?

356
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:03,018
Joe, I can explain.

357
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,789
You already have a job
in law enforcement, Barry.

358
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,524
I suggest you get back to it.

359
00:16:08,526 --> 00:16:10,726
Mm-hmm.

360
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:12,561
Don't look at me. I'm on your side.

361
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:13,963
Detective.

362
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:15,231
We all want what's best for Barry.

363
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,299
If you wanted what was best for Barry,

364
00:16:17,301 --> 00:16:19,068
you'd try to talk him out of this lunacy

365
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,837
instead of encouraging him going
out there risking his life.

366
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,508
You saw a man control the weather.

367
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,578
What are the police gonna do
against someone like that?

368
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,213
Since the accelerator explosion

369
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:34,250
we suspect there may be more like him.

370
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:35,584
And you're gonna do what?

371
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:37,219
Catch them?

372
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,788
Are you insane?

373
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,223
You think because you can run real fast

374
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:43,559
that you're invincible? You're not!

375
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:45,227
You're just a kid.

376
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:48,597
My kid.

377
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:52,468
I'm not your kid, Joe.

378
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,037
And you're not my father.

379
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,375
My father's sitting in Iron Heights.

380
00:16:59,377 --> 00:17:02,244
Wrongfully convicted.

381
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,946
You were wrong about him.

382
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:06,115
And you're wrong about this.

383
00:17:06,117 --> 00:17:07,950
Now I may not be able to help him,

384
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:10,753
but if I can save someone
from a burning building

385
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:13,856
or stop some armed thieves,
I'm gonna do it.

386
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,859
And you can't stop me.

387
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,294
So don't try.

388
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:28,137
You think you're so smart.

389
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:30,473
All of you.

390
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:34,076
But you don't know what you don't know.

391
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:36,612
And I hope that you're clever
enough to figure it out

392
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:38,614
before somebody gets killed.

393
00:17:57,033 --> 00:18:00,102
Where's the rest of your crew?

394
00:18:00,104 --> 00:18:01,104
Just me.

395
00:18:01,105 --> 00:18:02,505
What do you want, black?

396
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,373
The only thing I still want in life...

397
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,175
Your boss dead.

398
00:18:06,177 --> 00:18:08,010
It's not my fault you and
your team moved too slow.

399
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:10,346
I told you where Stagg would be,
not how long he'd be there.

400
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:11,914
I need his full itinerary.

401
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,250
And security access to his office and home.

402
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:15,918
Screw you.

403
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,887
I've got a reputation
in the security business.

404
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,755
It's one thing if my employer gets iced.

405
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:22,358
It's another if it happens in his bedroom.

406
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,861
You'll do what I ask, Mr. Java.

407
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,868
What the hell are you gonna
do to me without your army?

408
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:59,028
I am an army.

409
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:16,779
Come to yell at me again?

410
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,982
Simon Stagg's head of security
was murdered last night.

411
00:19:19,984 --> 00:19:21,951
The coroner took some skin samples.

412
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,419
Hopefully they belong to the killer.

413
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,054
See if you can find a match.

414
00:19:25,056 --> 00:19:26,255
Can't be a coincidence that Stagg's benefit

415
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:27,623
was attacked last night.

416
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,224
I'm going to interview Stagg now.

417
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:30,559
- I'll come with you.
- Your job is in here.

418
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:33,228
Stay in here and do it.

419
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,064
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, baby.

420
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,899
Gotta go.

421
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:39,134
Why is my dad mad at you?

422
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:42,905
Work stuff.

423
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,542
Why are <i>you</i> mad at me?

424
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:48,210
You were supposed to meet me at Jitters

425
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,579
to give me some scientific
background for my article.

426
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:52,314
And I didn't show up.

427
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,483
And now I have to come up with
a new article topic in 24 hours

428
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,218
or I fail the assignment.

429
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,387
- Iris...
- Don't say that you're sorry.

430
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:00,055
Okay, I know that you are.

431
00:20:00,057 --> 00:20:01,457
What I don't know is
what is going on with you.

432
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:04,059
We grew up one bedroom down

433
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:05,394
from each other. Do you honestly think that

434
00:20:05,396 --> 00:20:07,396
I don't know when you're happy?

435
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:09,832
Or sad or depressed or lost?

436
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,634
I'm gonna ask you
one last time, Barry Allen,

437
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:13,402
and you better be honest with me.

438
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:15,070
What the...

439
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:16,639
You want to know what's happening.

440
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:18,273
I'm fast now.

441
00:20:18,275 --> 00:20:20,476
God, I just want to tell you.

442
00:20:20,478 --> 00:20:22,111
How I feel.

443
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:24,113
How you make me feel.

444
00:20:24,115 --> 00:20:26,115
But I can't.

445
00:20:26,117 --> 00:20:27,650
Hell is going on with you?

446
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:33,088
We are not done talking about this.

447
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,123
That's impossible.

448
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,557
There was a murder last night.

449
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,126
These skin cells belong to the murderer,

450
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:38,494
but these cells are naive.

451
00:20:38,496 --> 00:20:40,095
Stem cells that they can replicate

452
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:42,131
and become any cell the body needs.

453
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,932
They only come from babies.

454
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:47,036
This means your killer is what, a newborn?

455
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,571
You honestly think that
someone wants to kill me?

456
00:20:49,573 --> 00:20:51,373
Well, we're not sure, Mr. Stagg, but...

457
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,575
An event you were being honored
at was robbed at gunpoint.

458
00:20:53,577 --> 00:20:56,278
And your head of security
was found murdered this morning.

459
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,480
I am a scientist and a philanthropist.

460
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:00,649
We're not often the targets of assassins.

461
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:02,217
Well...What about lawsuits?

462
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,987
You got about 20 of those
pending against you.

463
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:07,322
It is a sad fact of life, Detective, that

464
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:08,857
when you earn a lot of money,

465
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,727
people who haven't think
they can take yours.

466
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,862
People like this guy, for example?

467
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,998
Danton Black?

468
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,332
Danton Black.

469
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:20,369
You fired him. Now he's suing you.

470
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:23,272
Unfortunately, our working
relationship wasn't successful,

471
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:25,708
but I can assure you both of one thing.

472
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,543
Danton Black...

473
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:29,445
Is not a killer.

474
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,214
He's a clinical researcher,
not a criminal mastermind.

475
00:21:32,216 --> 00:21:35,350
Now, if I can help you
in any way, please let me know.

476
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,352
I want these people caught as much as you.

477
00:21:37,354 --> 00:21:38,721
Then here we are!

478
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:39,723
Down!

479
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,676
Captain, what's going on?

480
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:05,247
Not now, Barry. An armed gunman
is shooting up Stagg Industries.

481
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:07,216
Joe's there.

482
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,359
Get him out of here. I'll cover you.

483
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,895
Ready? Go.

484
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,223
Go!

485
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,225
No.

486
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:54,229
Whoever you are, give yourself up.

487
00:22:54,231 --> 00:22:55,231
Sorry.

488
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,698
We are not going anywhere.

489
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,102
Until Simon Stagg is dead.

490
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,250
Sorry.

491
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,118
The abrasions are already rapidly healing.

492
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,154
Yeah, I got my ass handed to me.

493
00:23:52,156 --> 00:23:54,189
You got blood on my suit.

494
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:56,959
I think some of it belongs to him.

495
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:59,461
Another not-so-friendly meta-human.

496
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:03,732
Danton Black.

497
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,000
He's a bio-geneticist

498
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:06,969
specialized in therapeutic cloning.

499
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:08,804
Growing new organs to replace failing ones.

500
00:24:08,806 --> 00:24:11,974
Apparently Stagg stole his
research and then fired him.

501
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:15,077
I saw Black create duplicates
from his own body.

502
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,245
That's pretty ironic.

503
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,679
The guy specialized in cloning

504
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:19,181
and now he can make xeroxes of himself.

505
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:22,017
If he was experimenting on himself

506
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:23,418
when he was exposed to the dark matter wave

507
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,654
released by the particle
accelerator explosion...

508
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:29,591
Meet Captain clone.

509
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,026
Don't worry.

510
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:33,195
I'll come up with something cooler.

511
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:39,134
Where are you going?

512
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:41,203
Joe was right.

513
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:42,704
I'm in way over my head.

514
00:24:42,706 --> 00:24:45,874
Yeah, I'm fast, but I am no warrior.

515
00:24:45,876 --> 00:24:49,645
Man, I could barely fight one
meta-human, let alone six.

516
00:24:51,347 --> 00:24:53,215
Barry.

517
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:54,750
I understand.

518
00:24:54,752 --> 00:24:56,318
Today was a setback.

519
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,153
But any grand enterprise has them.

520
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:02,891
And we can never learn to fly
without crashing a few times.

521
00:25:02,893 --> 00:25:07,062
This wasn't a grand enterprise, Dr. Wells.

522
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:09,064
This was a mistake.

523
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:28,216
Dad!

524
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:32,054
Sorry. No physical contact.

525
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:33,221
Five minutes, Allen.

526
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,727
Sit down, son.

527
00:25:42,098 --> 00:25:43,598
Barry, how did you get here?

528
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,734
I ran here. Joe wouldn't bring me.

529
00:25:45,736 --> 00:25:46,902
He wouldn't let me see you.

530
00:25:46,904 --> 00:25:48,470
- I hate him.
- No, no.

531
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:51,206
Don't... Don't say that.

532
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:54,943
It isn't Joe that doesn't
want you to come here.

533
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:58,146
I don't want you to come here.

534
00:25:58,148 --> 00:26:01,283
I don't want you to see me like this.

535
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:02,484
You have to let him go.

536
00:26:02,486 --> 00:26:04,386
My dad didn't do these things.

537
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:05,787
He didn't hurt my mom.

538
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,289
It was the man in the lightning.

539
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,557
The lightning man killed my mom.

540
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,624
- Barry, look at me.
- Not my dad.

541
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:12,961
Look at me.

542
00:26:12,963 --> 00:26:16,465
You can't help me.

543
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,534
Okay? Now Joe's gonna look after you

544
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,336
until I can get out of here.

545
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:26,675
You just be the good boy that
your mom and I know you are.

546
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,359
Dad?

547
00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:46,528
Dad?

548
00:26:59,342 --> 00:27:01,376
Detective, was the gunman apprehended?

549
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:03,879
The shooter's whereabouts are
unknown at this time.

550
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:06,848
We consider him armed and
extremely dangerous.

551
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,252
Thank you. No more questions.

552
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,686
Nice work, Eddie.

553
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:13,722
Nah. Right place, right time.

554
00:27:13,724 --> 00:27:15,457
No, you were a hero today.

555
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:18,126
CCPD still has a killer on the loose.

556
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:19,528
I should get back to the precinct.

557
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,096
Okay.

558
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:27,569
So did you come here for caffeine,

559
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:30,338
or are you finally gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

560
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,012
Mr. Stagg, I wish you would

561
00:27:37,014 --> 00:27:39,614
reconsider our offer for
protective custody.

562
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,450
Danton Black has proven
he is willing to kill,

563
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:44,019
and he's got uh... Friends.

564
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:46,388
And trust me, they're all dangerous.

565
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,057
I've increased my security, Detective.

566
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:51,593
I hope black comes looking for trouble.

567
00:27:51,595 --> 00:27:52,595
'Cause he'll find plenty.

568
00:27:56,999 --> 00:27:59,000
Spoken like a true philanthropist.

569
00:27:59,002 --> 00:28:01,269
Or is it humanitarian? Ah.

570
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:02,971
I'm sorry. I can never remember

571
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:06,241
which one you're pretending to be, Simon.

572
00:28:06,243 --> 00:28:07,409
Harrison...

573
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:08,477
Don't get up.

574
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,978
Ha-ha!

575
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,151
Another fan of yours, Doctor?

576
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,086
Can we talk, Detective?

577
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:19,955
So you were right.

578
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:22,090
Barry's not the only one who's special.

579
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:25,694
This guy that tried to kill
Simon Stagg today, he could...

580
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:27,963
Replicate spontaneously.

581
00:28:27,965 --> 00:28:30,132
Yeah, we know.

582
00:28:30,134 --> 00:28:34,269
Did you know about Barry?

583
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:37,405
When he was first in his coma

584
00:28:37,407 --> 00:28:39,674
you came to the hospital, and you asked me

585
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,677
if you could take him to S.T.A.R. Labs.

586
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,247
Did you know what he could do?

587
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:53,822
I had my suspicions that he was...

588
00:28:53,824 --> 00:28:55,023
affected.

589
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,025
Mm-hmm.

590
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,659
Hey, Joe...

591
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,194
I was never looking to become
the senior member

592
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,296
of a secret crime fighting unit.

593
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:02,964
You and I both know

594
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:06,234
we are the only ones equipped
to protect Central City.

595
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:09,070
Maybe I'm more interested in
protecting Barry.

596
00:29:09,072 --> 00:29:10,472
But of course he's all set to fly

597
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:11,740
into the fire right along with you.

598
00:29:11,742 --> 00:29:13,175
No, he's not.

599
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:15,510
Not anymore. He quit.

600
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:18,680
He didn't tell you?

601
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:20,148
I haven't seen him.

602
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,550
Well I'm sure it's only temporary.

603
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:22,851
From what I know of Barry,

604
00:29:22,853 --> 00:29:24,653
when he sets his mind to something...

605
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:25,987
No one's gonna talk him out of it.

606
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:28,890
But the next time he suits up...

607
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,258
Fshh!

608
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,093
Runs headlong into danger...

609
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:33,862
He will fail.

610
00:29:33,864 --> 00:29:36,298
Why?

611
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,133
He doesn't think he's capable.

612
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:40,869
Doubt...

613
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:42,904
Is his real enemy.

614
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,407
Joe, not whatever's lurking out there.

615
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,876
And as long as you continue to doubt him,

616
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:50,078
he'll keep doubting himself.

617
00:29:56,152 --> 00:29:57,385
And for the record...

618
00:29:57,387 --> 00:29:59,387
I care about him, too.

619
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:12,000
Guess you were hungry.

620
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:15,303
- Stress eating.
- Ah.

621
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:17,005
I came to say I'm sorry.

622
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:19,241
And you're right. I have been distant.

623
00:30:19,243 --> 00:30:22,744
- Correct.
- Kind of a jerk.

624
00:30:22,746 --> 00:30:24,212
You should apologize more often.

625
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:25,814
You are really sensational at it.

626
00:30:25,816 --> 00:30:26,881
Hmm.

627
00:30:26,883 --> 00:30:29,251
Hmm. So...

628
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:30,552
What were you going to
tell me the other day?

629
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:31,987
I thought I had to do something.

630
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:33,755
Something I thought was important,

631
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:37,759
but it turns out that
I'm not very good at it.

632
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:40,195
But what I am good at is being your friend.

633
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:41,696
So if you need help coming up with

634
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:43,632
- a new topic for your article...
- I found one.

635
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:46,234
Something that actually interests me.

636
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:48,503
I know this is gonna sound crazy...

637
00:30:48,505 --> 00:30:51,172
It's been all over the Internet this week.

638
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:52,207
At a building fire...

639
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:53,575
At a bank heist...

640
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:54,976
Even the other night when those robbers

641
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,044
shot at the security guard,

642
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:58,380
he said he was whooshed outside.

643
00:30:58,382 --> 00:31:01,216
Something out there is saving people.

644
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:02,384
I thought you were taking journalism.

645
00:31:02,386 --> 00:31:04,152
Not science fiction writing.

646
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,420
Ever since I have known you

647
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:06,588
you have believed in the impossible.

648
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,556
What if you were right?

649
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:10,225
What if you were right about
the night that your mom died?

650
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,996
Look, I told you I'm through.

651
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,232
I know, but you need
to get to S.T.A.R. Labs

652
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:19,301
right now.

653
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:29,978
- Barry, it's okay.
- It is not okay.

654
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,947
Black is here, and he's just...
Standing there.

655
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:34,783
That's not him, is it?

656
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:36,651
It's one of his replicates.

657
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:38,053
How did you get it?

658
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:40,622
I grew him.

659
00:31:40,624 --> 00:31:43,258
I isolated a sample of
Black's blood from you suit

660
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,660
to see if I could trigger the
in vitro cultivation process

661
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:47,662
and learn how Black multiplies.

662
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:50,432
So I exposed the target cells to
a protein gel,

663
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:52,233
and they began replicating...

664
00:31:52,235 --> 00:31:53,301
Into that.

665
00:31:53,303 --> 00:31:54,303
Why isn't he...

666
00:31:54,304 --> 00:31:56,404
It doing anything?

667
00:31:56,406 --> 00:31:57,972
We did a brain scan.

668
00:31:57,974 --> 00:32:00,375
Involuntary motor functions
are active, little else.

669
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,910
We think it's acting as a receiver.

670
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:04,846
The clones are an
empty shell without Black.

671
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:06,181
Shut down the real Black,

672
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:08,283
and you might shut them all down.

673
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:10,151
But how do we know which one's
the real Danton Black?

674
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:12,287
That occurred to me
given your own passing out.

675
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,955
Black has limits, just like you.

676
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:15,657
Controlling all of those clones

677
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,993
must require a tremendous amount
of physical strength.

678
00:32:18,995 --> 00:32:22,430
So, look for the one showing
signs of weakness or fatigue.

679
00:32:22,432 --> 00:32:23,432
He's the prime.

680
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:24,999
Just a theory...

681
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:26,968
But one you might want to put to
the test, Mr. Allen.

682
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,337
Plus, I whipped up these high-
calorie protein bars

683
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:32,006
for you to keep your metabolism up.

684
00:32:32,008 --> 00:32:33,174
Ah!

685
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:35,343
Ah!

686
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,046
Any more of them?

687
00:32:38,048 --> 00:32:39,048
Nope.

688
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:40,682
Why did it start moving?

689
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:42,283
The prime.

690
00:32:42,285 --> 00:32:43,618
My guess is, the prime is on the move.

691
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,986
This one heard the summons to battle.

692
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:46,721
And I know where he was summoned to.

693
00:32:46,723 --> 00:32:48,490
Stagg Industries.

694
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:50,291
You should call it in.

695
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:53,161
Police can't fight this.

696
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:56,931
What Black's become, like Mardon...

697
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,199
Beyond me.

698
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:00,368
Maybe way beyond them, too.

699
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:02,437
The only person it's not beyond

700
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,105
is you.

701
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,041
You gotta do this. I get it.

702
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:11,079
So for once in your life,
do what I tell you to do.

703
00:33:11,081 --> 00:33:13,081
Go stop him.

704
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:30,298
Just get me those figures by morning, okay?

705
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:36,938
Freeze. Don't move.

706
00:33:55,925 --> 00:33:57,292
Hello, Danton.

707
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:59,127
Goodbye, Simon.

708
00:34:01,964 --> 00:34:04,132
Stay here.

709
00:34:08,571 --> 00:34:10,672
I know Stagg stole your research,

710
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:13,274
but that doesn't give you
the right to murder.

711
00:34:27,756 --> 00:34:29,958
You think this is about my job.

712
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,826
Aah!

713
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:33,428
This is about Elizabeth.

714
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,430
She was my wife.

715
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:37,265
Gah!

716
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:39,767
She had a degenerative coronary disease.

717
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:42,570
She'd been on the transplant
list for years, but...

718
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:44,839
Time was running out.

719
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:46,841
So if I couldn't get her a new heart...

720
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:49,577
You were gonna grow her one.

721
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:51,246
I was so close.

722
00:34:51,248 --> 00:34:53,414
Until Stagg stole my research.

723
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,651
So he could reap the glory.

724
00:34:56,653 --> 00:35:00,421
And I got to bury my best friend.

725
00:35:00,423 --> 00:35:03,091
Now...

726
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:04,192
I'm alone.

727
00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:06,528
Gah!

728
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:17,138
Ah!

729
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,146
Ah!

730
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,484
Remember, Barry. Find the prime.

731
00:35:29,486 --> 00:35:31,085
There's too many of them to fight.

732
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,688
Barry, you need to isolate the prime.

733
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,391
I can't. It's impossible.

734
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:39,193
Nothing's impossible, Barry.
You taught me that.

735
00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:40,428
You can do this.

736
00:36:21,905 --> 00:36:24,238
Barry.

737
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,607
Barry, are you all right?

738
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:28,242
I'm fine.

739
00:36:28,244 --> 00:36:30,111
I'm fine.

740
00:36:30,113 --> 00:36:32,747
It's done.

741
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:41,589
Hang on!

742
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:44,492
No!

743
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:49,097
Don't.

744
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:50,698
Ah!

745
00:37:03,278 --> 00:37:04,879
Central City police officials
are now confirming

746
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,481
former employee Danton Black...
tried to save him.

747
00:37:06,483 --> 00:37:09,384
Doesn't sound like he wanted to be saved.

748
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:12,887
Some people, when they break...

749
00:37:12,889 --> 00:37:15,890
They can't be put together again.

750
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:19,694
Some people heal even stronger.

751
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,696
I hope so.

752
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,804
Well, at least multiplex

753
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:32,440
won't be able to hurt anyone else.

754
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:34,042
Told you I'd come up with a cool name.

755
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:40,882
Yeah, I may be the one in the
suit doing all the running...

756
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,385
But when I'm out there helping
people, making a difference...

757
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,888
You're all out there with me.

758
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:52,660
Finally realized something,

759
00:37:52,662 --> 00:37:56,197
we were all struck by that lightning.

760
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:15,783
Hungry?

761
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:21,089
Pepperoni, olives...

762
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,190
And jalapeños.

763
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:24,092
Just like you like it.

764
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:28,496
Thank you.

765
00:38:28,498 --> 00:38:30,832
You were wrong.

766
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:32,533
I have been wrong a lot this week.

767
00:38:32,535 --> 00:38:34,268
You're gonna have to be more specific.

768
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,404
You said that one of things driving you

769
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:39,407
to run around out there was that
you couldn't help your dad.

770
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,081
You can help him.

771
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,950
We can.

772
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,451
We're gonna figure out

773
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,287
who or what killed your mother that night.

774
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:57,225
And then we're gonna get
your father out of prison.

775
00:38:57,227 --> 00:38:59,227
Together.

776
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:06,801
Joe, what I said about
you not being my father...

777
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,269
Barry, I know.

778
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:12,006
I know I'm not your father.

779
00:39:12,008 --> 00:39:14,408
You're right. You're not.

780
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,779
You're just... The man who kept me fed

781
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:20,314
and in clothes...

782
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,183
Who sat beside my bed at night
until I fell asleep

783
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:25,253
because I was afraid of the dark...

784
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,688
helped me with my homework...

785
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:31,292
You taught me how to drive and shave...

786
00:39:31,294 --> 00:39:35,630
And you dropped me off at college.

787
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:38,232
Sounds a lot like a dad to me.

788
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,751
Every kid dreams of being a superhero.

789
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:58,953
Having powers. Saving people.

790
00:39:58,955 --> 00:40:01,189
But no kid thinks about what
it's like when you're a hero

791
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,157
and you're not saving people.

792
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,425
Truth is...

793
00:40:04,427 --> 00:40:05,660
Not much else changes.

794
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:07,895
You still hurt. You still love.

795
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:10,431
You still wish and hope and fear things.

796
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:13,668
And you still need people
to help you with all of it.

797
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,071
In some ways, that's the best part.

798
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:21,342
Barry, an armored car was just
hijacked on Griffin Avenue.

799
00:40:21,344 --> 00:40:22,476
Get your ass over there.

800
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:23,845
I got it. Actually...

801
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:25,079
The best part?

802
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:26,581
It's this.

803
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,596
Wells...

804
00:40:41,598 --> 00:40:43,798
Who the hell let you in here?

805
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,566
You been having a party out there?

806
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,668
I'm sure you saw on TV.

807
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,638
A former employee of mine tried to kill me.

808
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,442
Former employee with
the ability to replicate...

809
00:40:54,444 --> 00:40:58,145
Faced off against a man
who could move at super speed.

810
00:40:58,147 --> 00:41:02,083
You've seen him too, haven't you?

811
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,384
Indeed, I have.

812
00:41:03,386 --> 00:41:06,320
Extraordinary.

813
00:41:06,322 --> 00:41:08,556
The power he possesses, it's like the...

814
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:09,724
it's like the Gods of old.

815
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:12,059
It's like Mercury on earth.

816
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:14,295
Can you imagine if you could
control his power?

817
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:15,730
If you could... if you could harness it?

818
00:41:15,732 --> 00:41:19,800
You could change what it means to be human.

819
00:41:19,802 --> 00:41:21,969
The man in a red mask is the key,

820
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:25,139
and I'm gonna get him.

821
00:41:28,076 --> 00:41:31,379
The man in the red mask.

822
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:34,081
He's called the Flash.

823
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:36,250
Or at least...

824
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:38,686
He will be one day.

825
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:42,356
What the hell?

826
00:41:45,528 --> 00:41:48,162
Forgive me, Simon.

827
00:41:48,164 --> 00:41:49,664
I worry you think that
you will think this is personal,

828
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:51,198
and it's not.

829
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,668
It's just that the man in the red mask...

830
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:56,704
The fastest man alive...

831
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:58,806
he must be kept...

832
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:03,411
safe.

833
