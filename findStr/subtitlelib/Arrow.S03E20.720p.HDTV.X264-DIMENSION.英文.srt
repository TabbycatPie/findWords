7
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,670
Previously, on "Arrow"...

8
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,040
These waters' powers,

9
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
they have permitted me to live way beyond my time.

10
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,230
I want you to take my place.

11
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,200
I want you to become the next Ra's Al Ghul.

12
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,610
If you insist on pursuing this path of resistance,

13
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,610
there will be consequences.

14
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,630
Is that a threat?

15
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,760
I am the demon's head.

16
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,130
And very soon, your brother.

17
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,390
He will never take your place.

18
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,320
He will.

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,930
Thea?

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,440
Thea?!

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, my God, Thea!

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,340
I... couldn't... stop him.

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,240
I need an ambulance to 455 Merced, unit 10.

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,480
Please hurry.

25
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,510
Ok, you're going to be ok.

26
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,510
You're going to be ok.

27
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,040
No, Thea, stay awake! Come on! Up!

28
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,210
Hang on, we're almost there.

29
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,250
How long was she like this?

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,300
Uh, 20 minutes, 40,

31
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,340
I don't know, I just found her.

32
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,730
- You need to stay here. - I'm not going to leave her!

33
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,740
You need to let us work.

34
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,050
- Get me a set of vitals. - Lift.

35
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,490
Charge up to 200 joules.

36
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,610
Clear.

37
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,560
Draw up one milligram epi, charge to 200.

38
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,940
Clear.

39
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,600
Start CPR.

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,380
Come on.

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,490
Come on, stay with us.

42
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,270
We did the best we could under the circumstances,

43
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,100
but her injuries were extensive.

44
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,530
Even if she were to regain consciousness,

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,390
we can prolong her life for as long as you wish.

46
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,960
But...it might be best to consider other options.

47
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,640
I am truly sorry, Mr. Queen.

48
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,960
May I see her?

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,380
Sorry.

50
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,670
Oliver...

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,690
Thea.

52
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,320
What are they doing?

53
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,670
They're unloading the truck,

54
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,940
and, um,

55
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,160
having dinner.

56
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,780
General Shrieve is there.

57
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,490
The alpha, the Omega, he's combining them.

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
- The bio weapon is armed. - What happens now?

59
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,670
Now he'll take it somewhere to be released.

60
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,450
Somewhere densely populated where it will have the most impact.

61
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,020
We need to stop that truck.

62
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,850
Where's Oliver?

63
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,410
Come on!

64
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,640
You stole a car?

65
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,340
I borrowed it. Come on.

66
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,330
Oh, my God. Oliver!

67
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,110
Oliver, we came as soon as we could.

68
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,150
What happened?

69
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,280
Oliver.

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,560
They just left her there.

71
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,400
To die.

72
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,200
Oliver, is--is she?

73
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,780
It's bad.

74
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,300
What is it?

75
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,830
Smoke.

76
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,970
The League?

77
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,560
Screw 'em. At least until we get our bearings, Oliver.

78
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,970
- Come up with a plan. - He's won.

79
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,030
There is no plan.

80
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,720
Stay here with Thea.

81
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,320
Did you do this?

82
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,940
Did you do this?!

83
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,270
You could still save her, Oliver.

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
I don't understand.

85
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,870
Take your rightful place as heir to the demon...

86
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,300
And Ra's Al Ghul will bring your sister back.

87
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,420
Oliver, what's going on?

88
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,860
- Oliver, where are you going? - Away.

89
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,130
You can't just leave like this.

90
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,480
You have to tell us what's happening.

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,190
There's a way for me to save her.

92
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,080
Thea?

93
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,660
Come on, Oliver, that's not possible.

94
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,580
Yes, it is.

95
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,810
There are waters in Nanda Parbat.

96
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,980
They've permitted Ra's to live for over a hundred years.

97
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,090
And in rare instances,

98
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,840
told in legend, those waters have been used to restore

99
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,160
the dead to life.

100
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,900
He offered to use the Lazarus pit on Thea, didn't he?

101
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,370
Lazarus, as in from the Bible, Lazarus?

102
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,250
The pit's real. I've seen it.

103
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,580
- It can save Thea. - Right.

104
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,420
But only if you become the new Ra's.

105
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,700
Ok. Well, even if a magic hot tub

106
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,820
were not crazy talk,

107
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,110
we're not going to let you go

108
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,840
and join the league of psychotic murderers,

109
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,260
Even if it is to save Thea.

110
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,560
Which this wouldn't.

111
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,050
The waters change a person.

112
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,380
In the soul.

113
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,180
Even if they work, the Thea you get back

114
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,840
will not be the one you lost.

115
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,270
The one we lost because of you.

116
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,140
- Oliver... - I'd prefer that we didn't do our usual

117
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,190
"Please don't go" dance.

118
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,300
We're not going to.

119
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,190
Because I'm coming with you. Assuming that this works,

120
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,150
someone's going to need to bring Thea back home.

121
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,770
We need a way to get to Nanda Parbat.

122
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,350
Sorry to interrupt.

123
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,040
Everything all right?

124
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,530
Cause you got that crease between your eyebrows

125
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,220
that tells me things most definitely are not.

126
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,800
Something awful has happened.

127
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,290
And I-I need a favor.

128
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,410
A really big favor.

129
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,900
Last time you asked me for a big favor,

130
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,300
I had to loan you my helicopter.

131
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,710
Don't need your helicopter.

132
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,700
I need your jet.

133
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,360
Well, Oliver does, but both of us.

134
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,180
It's not what you think.

135
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,940
Well, if you're going to fly away with him,

136
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,660
then...it's exactly what I think.

137
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,650
Ray...

138
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,630
Last night was a bit of an eye-opener.

139
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,890
Insofar as realizing something

140
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,350
I should have realized a long time ago...

141
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
can be considered eye-opening.

142
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,700
Last night, when you were saying good-bye to Roy,

143
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
you and Oliver...

144
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,110
You still have feelings for him.

145
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,260
When I...told you that I loved you at the hospital,

146
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,200
you responded with jell-o.

147
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,700
Seeing you two together last night,

148
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,750
I realized...

149
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,190
you don't love me because you're in love with him.

150
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,770
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,830
You're the last person I ever meant to hurt.

152
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,380
Take the jet.

153
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,720
I hope the something awful

154
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,950
stops being awful.

155
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,090
What did Felicity say to Dr. Vaca?

156
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,410
She thinks Thea's being moved to Central City.

157
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,410
You know, they do amazing things at S.T.A.R. Labs.

158
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,090
We might think about paying them a visit

159
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,850
before putting Thea on a long flight to Nanda Parbat.

160
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,130
S.T.A.R. Labs can't save her.

161
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,630
Only the Lazarus pit can.

162
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,670
Oliver!

163
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,510
Look, I know what I have done

164
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,760
doesn't seem like the actions of a loving father,

165
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,540
but I do love her.

166
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,830
She's the only child I have left.

167
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,920
Having said that,

168
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,860
I would rather lose her forever

169
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,830
than-- than subject her to the pit.

170
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,380
Get on the plane, Malcolm.

171
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,730
You look chilly.

172
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,070
Thanks for letting me be here for you.

173
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,030
You're welcome.

174
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,180
I didn't have much of a choice, though, did I?

175
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,080
No.

176
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,940
I wanted to make you think

177
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,650
you had grown a little as a person.

178
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,630
I know that I've only told you a little

179
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,960
about the five years that I was away.

180
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,160
Well, if by "Little," You mean hardly anything.

181
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,370
I came back to Starling City

182
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,630
before they found me on the island.

183
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,480
I don't understand.

184
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,110
It was complicated.

185
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,570
I saw Thea.

186
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,710
She didn't see me.

187
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,530
She had a drug problem.

188
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,920
So I... confronted her dealer.

189
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,030
And I broke his neck.

190
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,050
And I did it because I was angry, sure.

191
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,060
But I also did it because I felt like I was protecting her.

192
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,540
All I've ever wanted to do was protect her.

193
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,520
Malcolm told me.

194
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,560
He warned me what Ra's might do.

195
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,460
But I never thought...

196
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,870
I failed.

197
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,240
Incoming!

198
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,550
Maseo, take the wheel.

199
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,540
You look like you can use a hand.

200
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,680
It's not in here.

201
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,710
What is that?

202
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,180
It's the League.

203
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,070
Welcome home, Al Sah-him.

204
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,570
I must prepare for the ritual.

205
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,970
I will treat her as my own family.

206
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,180
I hope you find the accommodations acceptable.

207
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,330
Such luxury is a small glimpse of the life that awaits Oliver.

208
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,140
You trying to reassure me or yourself?

209
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,430
I don't know what you mean.

210
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,570
You're Oliver's friend.

211
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,490
Maseo, right?

212
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,370
I am Sarab.

213
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,380
Call yourself whatever you want.

214
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,480
If you gave a damn about Oliver,

215
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,420
you wouldn't be working for

216
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,100
the man who practically killed his sister.

217
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,950
Oliver will be spared grief

218
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,580
in a manner that was denied to me,

219
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,240
and he'll receive an honor greater than you can imagine.

220
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,920
League of Assassins.

221
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,990
You're feared for your bravery

222
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,510
and power.

223
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,790
Well, all I see are a bunch of weak men

224
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,220
running from their lives, trying to escape.

225
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,390
That's not powerful, Maseo.

226
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,160
Or brave. That's cowardly.

227
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,070
Do not presume to know me

228
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,030
until you've held your dying child in your arms.

229
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,580
Until you've told him everything would be ok

230
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,300
so that the last words he ever hears

231
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,420
are a lie.

232
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,180
You know nothing.

233
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,180
I'm sorry.

234
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,120
What was your child's name?

235
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,420
Akio.

236
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,210
You think Akio would be proud of his father right now?

240
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,290
Thea!

241
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,250
Thea!

242
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,370
I've fulfilled my end of our arrangement.

243
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,170
I suggest you begin to make peace with yours.

244
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,330
It's ok. You're ok.

245
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,740
I don't know you.

246
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,600
Thea, it's-- it's me.

247
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,010
It's Ollie.

248
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,350
Ollie's dead.

249
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,810
Dad?

250
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,950
I'm here, Thea. It-- it's me.

251
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,420
What's going on?

252
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,870
Where am I?

253
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,330
Some place safe.

254
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,400
You are safe.

255
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,990
Where's mom?

256
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,140
Your mother's not here.

257
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,850
Look--

258
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,440
just lie back, close your eyes and get some rest, OK?

259
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,520
I love you, dad.

260
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,450
Ra's told me that the confusion would pass.

261
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,880
You have no idea what you've done.

262
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
What I've done?

263
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,340
She's alive, Malcolm.

264
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,990
What I did saved her life.

265
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,920
- She thinks Moira's still alive. - She'll be fine.

266
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,260
- You don't know that. - Yes, I do.

267
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,190
Because you, Diggle and Felicity

268
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,100
are going to take her home and she will recover.

269
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,620
And what is that worth?

270
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,360
- Felicity... - No, this is wrong! It is just wrong!

271
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,420
I need to talk to you.

272
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,350
What is happening here is perverse!

273
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,650
What you are doing to Oliver.

274
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,430
What you are making him do; I am not going to let it happen.

275
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,070
You can leave us.

276
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,110
You have a great fire within you.

277
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,980
I can see now why Oliver loves you.

278
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,490
If you knew the first thing about love,

279
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,260
you would not be ripping Oliver away from his family.

280
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,630
I am merely helping him fulfill his destiny.

281
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,670
Yeah, I know all about the "Survive my sword" prophecy,

282
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,620
and I am here to tell you that I could really give a crap.

283
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,690
Me and John and, God help me, Malcolm,

284
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,710
are not going to let this happen, and we have friends,

285
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,620
and we have resources and we will go to war to get Oliver back.

286
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,840
You know, many lifetimes ago,

287
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,600
I loved a woman immeasurably.

288
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,030
And she loved me.

289
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,480
And we had a son and then a daughter,

290
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,610
and for many years,

291
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,260
I felt I was the most fortunate man in the world.

292
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,850
My life was bliss.

293
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,370
And one night, a man came to my door

294
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,440
and he gave me a horrible choice--

295
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,620
to leave without saying a word to them,

296
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,920
or to stand and watch them tortured and then killed.

297
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,170
And I left without a farewell.

298
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,160
And to spare them pain,

299
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,500
I endured an agony worse than death.

300
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,010
Sounds like you gave up too easily.

301
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,470
If there's one immutable truth about life...

302
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,480
it's often more cruel than it is fair,

303
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,190
and rarely provides an opportunity for any of us to find closure.

304
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,060
And all your posturing

305
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,560
and all your threats of war

306
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,240
will merely delay the inevitable,

307
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,590
causing you to forfeit the opportunity you have.

308
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,360
This was denied me.

309
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,750
You need to tell oliver good-bye.

310
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,140
Tell him how much you love him.

311
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,400
Tell him whatever it is your heart needs to express.

312
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,680
And do it now.

313
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,230
Before he is lost to you forever.

314
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,290
Yeah?

315
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,000
You OK?

316
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,060
I'm sorry, that's a stupid question. You...

317
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,700
you just saw your sister come back from being mostly dead

318
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,100
and you are about to give up everything you know and love,

319
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,960
So you're probably not.

320
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,200
I remember the first time that I thought

321
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,850
I'd never see Thea again.

322
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,830
When my father's boat went down.

323
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,330
But you did see her again.

324
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,610
And you'll see her again...

325
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,150
again.

326
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,700
This is different.

327
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,230
I've just been thinking about the... person I was.

328
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,130
The brother that I was.

329
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,760
And how he probably died when that boat went down.

330
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,660
All this time, I've been struggling with who I am...

331
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,780
And you think who you're supposed to be is...

332
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,420
the next Ra's Al Ghul?

333
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,510
Honestly?

334
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,670
I don't know.

335
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,380
The only thing that I can know for sure

336
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,900
is that everything that I've done;

337
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,260
every--everything that happened,

338
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,810
it lead me right here,

339
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,200
to this moment.

340
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,630
And Felicity, if that's true,

341
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,200
then...I don't know what it was all for.

342
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,430
I do.

343
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,850
I wish that I could change your mind about staying here,

344
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,430
but I know I can't.

345
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,360
Just like I know how leaving you here is going to destroy me.

346
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,120
I don't regret a single moment.

347
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,980
And you shouldn't, either.

348
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,720
You have done so much.

349
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,310
You have saved so many people's lives.

350
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,000
And you have changed so many for the better.

351
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,790
Including mine.

352
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,870
Knowing you has changed my life.

353
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,800
You...opened up my heart

354
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,490
in a way I didn't even know was possible.

355
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,650
I love you.

356
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,780
We searched the whole truck. There's nothing in there.

357
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,720
Where is the bio weapon?

358
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,290
Don't make me ask again.

359
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,870
Food cart. It's in the food cart.

360
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,120
Where is the food cart?

361
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,350
We should split up to cover more ground.

362
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,930
What's wrong?

363
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,920
I know you don't think we should be doing this.

364
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,370
You decided we should set an example for our son.

365
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,950
And for ourselves.

366
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,540
We can't just let people die.

367
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,260
If we do, we are just a shell.

368
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,100
Not really alive at all.

369
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:08,380
So...that happened.

370
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,950
I'm glad it did.

371
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,050
Me, too.

372
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,260
What's this?

373
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,130
If there's any kind of God,

374
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,950
something...

375
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,680
alcoholic.

376
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,000
There's not much to toast to up here, is there?

377
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,360
There's us.

378
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,160
Yeah.

379
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,970
I'm sorry.

380
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,630
Look, I know there's no way of avoiding this,

381
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:55,200
of--of getting out of here,

382
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,160
going some place where Ra's can't find us, but I...

383
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,360
Felicity...

384
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,310
Felicity.

385
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,500
What did you--

386
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,700
I can't lose you.

387
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,860
I won't.

388
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:20,770
I stole some of that powder

389
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,380
that that creepy priest lady used on Thea.

390
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,350
Wasn't sure exactly what I was going to do with it when I got it,

391
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,080
but I...

392
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,920
Yeah, how did you know

393
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,970
you were going to completely lose your mind?

394
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,600
Or commit suicide.

395
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,220
Was your plan to sneak Ra's prize out

396
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,860
unconscious without getting us all killed?

397
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,190
No, it's an insane idea, but I couldn't do it.

398
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,570
I couldn't leave him.

399
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,970
We have to get him out of here.

400
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,340
Felicity, this place is like a fortress.

401
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,830
There's no way we're getting Oliver out of here

402
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,670
without Ra's knowing.

403
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,220
We can't. You can.

404
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,310
If we get caught, he'll kill all of us.

405
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,940
Then we can't get caught.

406
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,090
I have seen enough movies to know

407
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,610
that the scary fortress always has a secret exit.

408
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,390
You were Ra's right hand stooge for years.

409
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,160
If there is anyone that knows the way out of this hellhole,

410
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,410
it's you, so don't even try to play games with me.

411
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,140
The catacombs.

412
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,900
It's rough terrain. It is not going to be easy.

413
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,070
How do we get there?

414
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,510
Through the temple.

415
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,010
Go get Thea and meet us back here in five minutes.

416
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,120
Go!

417
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:22,920
Which way?

418
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,530
Temple's this way, come on!

419
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,910
There's not much time. Hurry.

420
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,530
Why are you helping us?

421
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,690
Because if I don't, then I am just a shell.

422
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,630
You reminded me of that.

423
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,600
30 meters down. The path forks.

424
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,400
- Take the left passage. - Come on.

425
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,850
These tunnels are centuries old. Stay close.

426
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,200
Need to stop and rest for a minute?

427
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,820
No, no, no.

428
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,450
Maseo says stay left.

429
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,530
Thea?

430
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,120
- We have to move, now! - Too late.

431
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,180
Believe me, we do not want to be taken alive.

432
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,930
Hold!

433
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,050
I am Al Sah-Him.

434
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,910
Wahreeth Al Ghul.

435
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:58,990
Heir to the demon. And you will obey.

436
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,410
Put your weapons down.

437
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,790
Now!

438
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,010
Tell Ra's I will return shortly.

439
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:16,160
Oliver, please!

440
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,870
Thank you for trying.

441
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,830
I love you all the more for it.

442
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,050
But this only ends one way.

443
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,860
This is as far as I go.

444
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,250
Oliver, the jet's less than a mile away.

445
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,790
Where are we going to fly to?

446
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,660
Ollie, I don't understand.

447
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,570
Malcolm is going to take you home.

448
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,040
Aren't you coming with?

449
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,170
Not now.

450
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,840
You go on, I'll catch up.

451
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,340
I love you, Thea.

452
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,600
Don't ever forget that, ok?

453
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,460
Oliver...

454
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,060
Oliver, I don't know what to say.

455
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,730
I do.

456
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,320
John, you're the best man I've ever known.

457
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,270
And whatever happens,

458
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,320
you're my brother.

459
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,910
I am afraid I will never forgive myself for leaving you here.

460
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,580
You told me once that...

461
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,060
life is precious.

462
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,050
And that you wanted more from it than I could offer you.

463
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,140
Don't give up on that.

464
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,940
The only way that I'm going to survive this...

465
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:16,130
is if I know that you're out there living your life, happy.

466
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,160
We're always saying good-bye to each other.

467
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,770
You'd think I'd be good at it by now.

468
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,960
Well, let's not say good-bye this time.

469
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:22,520
What's-- what's going on?

470
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,690
Everything's fine, Thea, you're-- you're ok.

471
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,580
If you're here, then I'm not.

472
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,850
Well, at least you're feeling a little more like yourself again.

473
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,380
What do you want?

474
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,080
Where's Ollie?

475
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,280
Thea, do you remember anything about the past few days?

476
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,450
I...

477
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,050
I was here.

478
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,280
And-- and Ra's, he--

479
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,470
he attacked me.

480
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:51,520
No, Thea.

481
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,610
He nearly killed you.

482
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,400
Where is my brother?

483
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,640
That is-- that is what I'm trying to explain.

484
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,580
To save you, Oliver had to join the league.

485
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:07,290
He-- he traded his life for yours.

486
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,640
No.

487
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,270
I'm so sorry.

488
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,610
I know you hate me, and you have every right,

489
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,060
But I am going to make up for that, for everything.

490
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,580
- That is not possible! - Yes, it is!

491
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,880
The league isn't after us anymore; I am free!

492
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,600
I could go anywhere in there world,

493
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,140
But... this is where I want to be. Here.

494
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,160
With my daughter.

495
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,180
You took care of me when I was injured. Now, please, Thea,

496
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,580
Please. Let me take care of you.

497
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,800
Sorry to interrupt.

498
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,400
Is everything all right?

499
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,920
No.

500
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,600
It's not.

501
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,500
Felicity...

502
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,720
Oliver's...

503
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,250
He's gone.

504
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,400
What are you talking about?

505
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,970
He joined the league.

506
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,440
He's not coming back.

507
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,080
Blood has been shed.

508
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,000
League blood.

509
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,920
And that is a transgression

510
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,830
punishable by death.

511
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,350
And yet you allowed your friends safe passage home.

512
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,010
You tell me why I should not hunt these people down

513
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,150
and stain my blade with their blood.

514
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,820
Because I stayed.

515
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,690
I'm honoring our agreement.

516
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,910
Now no one close to me will ever be harmed again.

517
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,130
And your allies would not

518
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,160
have been able to escape through the catacombs

519
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,290
without assistance, so you tell me who aided you,

520
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,040
Who this traitor is.

521
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,540
- I don't know. - Me.

522
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,320
I struck down three of our number.

523
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,680
For my betrayal...

524
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,680
I offer you my life.

525
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,790
You did not betray me tonight, Sarab.

526
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,710
Maseo Yamashiro did.

527
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,920
For a moment,

528
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,470
your old life took hold.

529
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,460
But by coming here and kneeling before me,

530
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,070
you have proven your loyalty,

531
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,410
And I will not spill Sarab's blood

532
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,390
for Maseo's actions. Stand up.

533
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,330
Your service will be vital in the coming weeks.

534
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,960
Oliver will need you for his transformation.

535
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,450
And like Sarab...

536
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,270
vestiges of your old identity still remain.

537
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:01,560
Oliver Queen must be extinguished from memory.

538
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,290
Stop!

539
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,750
Give me the vial.

541
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,040
The word "Assassin" has fallen victim

542
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,490
to many abuses of language.

543
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,200
Its real meaning hidden beneath the sediment

544
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,750
of lies and falsehoods.

545
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,420
In truth,

546
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,240
"Assassin" comes from Hashishiyya,

548
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,340
which means, "Those who stand apart from society."

549
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,770
Now, every man and woman in here

550
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,070
have renounced their past life

551
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,200
and forfeited their identity in the name of something new.

552
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,560
And it is a cleansing

553
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,480
only achieved by fire.

554
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,470
Embrace the pain,

555
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,860
for it is your soul finally being unburdened.

556
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,190
Oliver Queen is dead.

557
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,750
Eventually to be reborn as Ra's Al Ghul.

558
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,120
But for now, only the arrow,

559
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,820
