1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,880
So, this is the helmet

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,680
that I will race
in this year's Italian Grand Prix.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,280
The best feature about this helmet
for this weekend

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,040
is thatI will be able to take my mask off
as soon as I'm wearing the helmet.

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,520
- That's it.
- Okay.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,600
We cannot be too funny
considering the performance after Belgium.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,080
- Says who?
- We. Because...

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,520
I think you should be funny
if you look at our performance.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,600
So, is that the credo for this weekend,
"Don't laugh"?

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,840
- No!
- No jokes?

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,120
Enzo Ferrari said,

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
"Ask a child to draw a car
and they'll color it red."

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,640
I think
that's all you need to know about Ferrari.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,360
It's everyone's understanding
of what a racing car is.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Formula 1 is synonymous with Ferrari.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,160
They're the oldest-standing team.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,960
Arguably one of the biggest brands
in the world.

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,200
They're the most iconic team in Formula 1.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,880
A lot of drivers' dream is
to drive for Ferrari.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,440
<i>Seven World Championship titles.</i>

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,960
Ferrari enjoys a status

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,200
that no other team holds.

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,040
They use that to its strength.

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,000
Not again!

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,200
But sometimes it bites them.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,520
Ah, it's so frustrating!

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,720
We are outperforming Ferrari.

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,160
Oh, come on!

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,560
They aren't as competitive
as they normally are.

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,240
<i>Ferrari have Leclerc 13th,</i>

31
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,400
<i>Sebastian Vettel 14th.</i>

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,960
I'll hang in there,
but you know that you've messed up.

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,120
<i>The Ferrari engine power
is just not there.</i>

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,840
<i>Charles Leclerc absolutely plumb last.</i>

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,400
The feeling of Ferrari right now

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,280
is one of huge question marks.

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,240
<i>What a miserable season.</i>

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,880
Will they ever regain
the form of old?

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,200
I know what it feels like
to be running a team

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,600
when you're in the shit.

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,320
But I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy.

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,320
It's going to be a disaster.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,840
Um, can we talk a little bit
about the season so far?

44
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
It's been pretty difficult, right?

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Um...

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Why?

47
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,880
We don't have that much time
and, uh, yeah, to be honest...

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,080
Next question!

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,760
<i>It's a very speedy hello
from the fastest circuit of them all.</i>

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,000
<i>We're here in Monza</i>

51
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,120
<i>for round eight of the Formula 1
World Championship in 2020.</i>

52
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>It is the Italian Grand Prix.</i>

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
<i>Grazie.</i>

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Netflix again? Oh my God.

55
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
From where do you fly? LA?

56
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,120
No, I fly JFK.
I fly Charlotte, JFK, JFK, London.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,920
I come private if you want a lift?

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,120
- Where do you leave from?
- Guadalajara.

59
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,600
Their rooms
can't be smaller than ours.

60
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,800
Ferrari had bad seasons
in the past, as well as this year.

61
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,040
Yes, we are in a difficult moment,

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,760
but Monza is a very historic Grand Prix.

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
Obviously, being in Italy,
it's, uh, the one which counts.

64
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,320
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, fine.

65
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,720
Let me say,
you may lose a season,

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,280
but if you are winning Monza,
at least you have saved your season.

67
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
I am going to read out
some of the media questions.

68
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,840
- Yes.
- This is a question from Vanzini.

69
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,560
What is the key word right now?

70
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,200
What do you suggest?

71
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,080
Well, the same as always.

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,240
No, I think determination is better.

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,520
Yes, I would say
we have a lot of determination.

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
- More than usual.
- Yes.

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,840
Certainly, we understand
that it's a very difficult moment,

76
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,240
but I think
that the frustrations we've got, um,

77
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
we need to transform that
into determination.

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,096
- Ciao.
<i>- Buongiorno.</i>

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,400
<i>Buongiorno. </i>A difficult weekend
for you to arrive back here in Italy.

80
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,080
How do you keep the expectations realistic
for this weekend?

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,760
Uh, certainly, uh,
we know what we need to improve.

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,560
I think there is no doubt.

83
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,760
What's important is to stay focused
and really to try to work very hard

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,560
and to transform any frustration
into determination.

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
You feel for Ferrari,

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,320
going into their homeland
with nothing to show.

87
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,720
They have to try and find some redemption.

88
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,880
They have to find something
to pin this season on.

89
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,160
Do you think
it will be a bit like last year?

90
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
Hopefully,
it's got as bad as it's gonna get.

91
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I think it will be a mess.

92
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,400
- Looking good?
- As always.

93
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,960
Uh, can you just
turn upside down your mask?

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,200
This is not to be filmed,
but you got "Ferrari" upside down,

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,280
which is okay,
but maybe at best to put it...

96
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,720
- There you are.
- That's better?

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,880
- The filter.
- Yeah, the filter needs to be...

98
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
They are tricky.

99
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,440
Okay, now, first of all,
welcome, everybody, to Italy.

100
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
Uh, now, first point,
please wear your mask all the time.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
As usual, this is really important.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,640
Mask? No mask?

103
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,320
My name is Sebastian Vettel,
racing for Scuderia Ferrari.

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
No mask.

105
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
Wow.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,040
Brave.

107
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
No mask.

108
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,200
Don't look at your mobile
during media activity.

109
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,240
I'm telling you this
because the media have come up to us

110
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,240
saying, "Don't do it,
you know, it doesn't look good,"

111
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,200
so just be focused on what you're doing
and please don't look at your mobile.

112
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,480
That's four post-races
that I'm not speaking at all.

113
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,960
I'm watching the phone,
but don't have any questions.

114
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,720
I know, but it doesn't look good.

115
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,680
Hi, I'm Charles Leclerc,
driving for Scuderia Ferrari.

116
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,840
Um, I have a contract
until 2024 with the team

117
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,320
and I started in Formula 1 two years ago.

118
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Even if you're not talking,
you should show interest

119
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,240
in what Sebastian is saying, so, just...

120
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,760
I am showing interest.

121
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,880
But he is repeating, uh, the same...

122
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,520
It's always the same question,
so I know the answer.

123
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,080
Okay, okay, but still.

124
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,600
Wait another ten years,
then you'll see.

125
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,800
There's no hope for you on this.

126
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,400
Okay.

127
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,880
Uh, now, the first point, Charles...

128
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,520
I think that Seb is
a very experienced

129
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,040
four-times world champion,

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,840
but I think even for Seb,
it's always a continuous learning process.

131
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,280
Charles is very young.

132
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,600
He is very fast.

133
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,600
He is very consistent.

134
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,960
He is good in battling,

135
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,400
defending, attacking.

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,120
So, in order to develop our team
for this season,

137
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,640
there is not a number-one driver
in Ferrari.

138
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,200
Hello.

139
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
Hello.

140
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,040
<i>Morning, Charles and Seb.
How are you guys?</i>

141
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,520
Good, thank you.

142
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
<i>Right, let's get cracking.</i>

143
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,320
<i>We've got some brilliant fans here
who, uh, are dying to...</i>

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,080
- Hello.
<i>- </i>The connection has gone.

145
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
- Really?
- Yes.

146
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
Uh, cut Zoom.

147
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,000
- Go out, okay? Go out of Zoom.
- The problem is the connection.

148
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,320
- But to make this work.
- It's coming.

149
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,040
<i>- Hello!</i>
- Is it better?

150
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,840
<i>Yes. For now, it looks good.</i>

151
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
It's a difficult year
for Ferrari.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,840
Not just on track, also off track.

153
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,400
<i>Amazing modern technology.</i>

154
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,600
<i>Okay, Esther, go again.
What was your question?</i>

155
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,240
<i>Okay, so, Charles,</i>

156
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,920
<i>when will you launch
your clothing collection?</i>

157
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,760
Oh! Uh, well, at the end,
for now, it's on standby.

158
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,920
Uh, it's something I really wanted to do

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,320
and it's something that I think
I will keep in mind for the future.

160
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,816
- What's the collection?
- It was like full clothing.

161
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,240
- Like, a full collection.
- Ah. He's not allowed.

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,096
That's why it's not happening.

163
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,440
'Cause we have a... We have a partner.

164
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,920
So, he was told off.

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,720
I... I... I'm not supposed to say that,
but I'm leaving at the end of the year,

166
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,080
so I can say what I want,
you know?

167
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,760
It is clear that I will not be
a part of this team beyond this year.

168
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,400
I was surprised when I got the call
that the team does not want to continue.

169
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,080
Seb has been with us
a few years already.

170
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,000
I think we all love Seb

171
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,400
because he's part of our family,

172
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,360
but, uh, we felt the necessity to,
to look ahead, to look forward.

173
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,840
It's like trying to create foundations
for our long-term future.

174
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,560
For Ferrari to announce so publicly

175
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,760
that Sebastian Vettel's leaving the team,

176
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,120
I think, is a clear state of intention

177
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,240
of what they want for the future.

178
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
Charles Leclerc.

179
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,600
That's a pretty toxic environment

180
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,840
for a man
who's a four-times world champion.

181
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Would it make you insecure?

182
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,840
For sure, it's tough.
Obviously, I care a lot about the sport.

183
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,440
It's a big part of my life
and therefore, you know,

184
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,080
I asked myself a lot of questions
about what I want to do in the future.

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I think

186
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,920
that Sebastian

187
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,400
was left very hurt

188
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,160
by the way in which his departure
from the team came about.

189
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,680
The fact that the negotiations

190
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,800
hadn't been anywhere near as lengthy,
shall we say,

191
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
as we'd been led to believe.

192
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,880
I heard
that telling him so early

193
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,160
would have created a lot of difficulties.

194
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,160
But I think whatever were the concerns

195
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,600
people were raising
were the wrong concerns.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,080
Ferrari!
Ferrari! Ferrari!

197
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,240
Ferrari! Ferrari!

198
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,680
Ferrari is just special.
It has always been special for me.

199
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,400
Go on, Charles!

200
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,040
Go on, Charles!

201
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,560
From being a child,
I was always looking at the red car,

202
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,120
and, uh, it has always been a dream
to be a driver for, for them.

203
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,360
- Hey, guys.
- Thank you, Charles.

204
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,680
You're number one, bro!

205
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,520
Over winter, Ferrari gave
Charles Leclerc a contract extension,

206
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,720
the likes of which had never been seen.

207
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
Go on, you're the best!

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,760
Not even Schumacher
got a five-year contract extension

209
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,920
and Charles did,

210
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,920
which shows just how important
Charles had become to their future.

211
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,576
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well.

212
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, it still feels amazing
to know that, um,

213
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,560
I have the longest contract
in the history of Scuderia Ferrari

214
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,640
and to know that we will be working
for such a long time

215
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,600
and to be building
something special together.

216
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,720
Go on Charles, Ferrari!

217
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,280
Hello, thank you.

218
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,120
- Go on, you're the best!
- Kick his ass!

219
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,960
Hi, guys. Thanks.

220
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,680
Hello. Hi. I'm sorry.

221
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,960
- Let's see what today has in store.
- Let's see.

222
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,360
<i>Now,
from the Temple of Speed,</i>

223
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,080
<i>Monza's national autodrome,</i>

224
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,240
<i>it's time for Qualifying
with 20 of the best drivers in the world.</i>

225
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,280
<i>Today, Red Bull hope to interrupt
an endless stream of pole positions</i>

226
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,080
<i>for the German team.</i>

227
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,680
<i>And Ferrari are simply hoping somehow
to find their way into the top ten.</i>

228
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,440
Expectations are difficult to have
this season

229
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,120
because it's unpredictable, the results,
but it is a very special race for us,

230
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,000
so, uh, we have to do well.

231
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
But yeah, it's not going to be easy.

232
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,960
Morale is tough, obviously.
The team is certainly not on a high.

233
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,600
But I think everybody's trying
to do their most

234
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,920
to make sure
that we still get the best out of the car.

235
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,320
Qualifying's important.

236
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,680
It determines
your starting position on the grid.

237
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,640
The fewer people that start ahead of you,

238
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,440
the fewer people you've got to overtake
to win on Sunday.

239
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,360
Don't send me
in too much traffic.

240
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,600
<i>Copy.</i>

241
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,760
<i>This is the two Ferrari cars</i>.

242
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,640
Seb overtook me.

243
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,680
I don't understand
why I went out in front of him.

244
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,240
<i>Was he not meant
to overtake Charles?</i>

245
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,200
<i>Was Charles meant to be ahead of him?</i>

246
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,000
<i>Have Ferrari got things
a little bit mixed up?</i>

247
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,560
<i>All happy families down at Ferrari.</i>

248
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,480
Mode charge. Mode charge.

249
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,880
Track is clear behind.

250
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,480
<i>There's a pressure
on Charles Leclerc's shoulders,</i>

251
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,960
<i>the man, of course,
who was on pole position here last year.</i>

252
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,000
- The car is so hard to drive.
- Copy. Understood.

253
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,680
We aren't doing well on the long runs.

254
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,200
So difficult.

255
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,600
Ah, fuck's sake.

256
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,120
At the moment, you are P11.

257
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,240
We are so slow.

258
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,640
<i>There's nothing Leclerc can do.</i>

259
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,200
<i>He doesn't have enough prancing horses
down the front straight.</i>

260
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,920
<i>Charles Leclerc across the line.</i>

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,360
<i>Only 13th on the grid.</i>

262
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,560
<i>Thirteen, unlucky for some.</i>

263
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,360
Best I can do.

264
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,440
The best I can do.

265
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,640
<i>The real concern is
that's their true pace.</i>

266
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,640
Any cars around me?

267
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,640
No, we are in a good slot.

268
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,120
Hamilton 3.3 in front.

269
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,040
Constant speed 200.

270
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,480
There was a chance
to do better here.

271
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,840
<i>For info,
there's a big traffic jam out there.</i>

272
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,440
Let's talk about it after.

273
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,480
<i>Look. This is the kind
of traffic we were hoping they'd avoid.</i>

274
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,960
<i>If you need
to overtake people, we will.</i>

275
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,400
A similar queue to that
you had on your way back from holiday.

276
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,960
<i>Vettel can't fight back.
The Ferrari engine power isn't there.</i>

277
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,520
Is there a gap I can get through?

278
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,880
Too much traffic.

279
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,840
<i>It will be mode push
for last corner. Mode push.</i>

280
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,440
<i>What is going on out there
on this Saturday afternoon?</i>

281
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,720
<i>Sebastian Vettel,
he's in the bottom five at the moment,</i>

282
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,440
<i>crosses the line in a few moments,
Sebastian Vettel.</i>

283
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,800
<i>Uh, we see Vettel pitting.</i>

284
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,400
<i>He's pitted.
He's not going to improve his time.</i>

285
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,840
<i>Ferrari just weren't ready.</i>

286
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,960
<i>What has happened to them this year?</i>

287
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,840
Shit. What a mess.

288
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,840
<i>And the big headline news here at Monza</i>

289
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,960
<i>is that Sebastian Vettel
is knocked out in qualifying.</i>

290
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
<i>It's Ferrari, P17.</i>

291
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,240
- I guess that's it.
<i>- Yeah, it is. P17.</i>

292
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,200
<i>Not quite the Ferrari
of old here in Monza, is it?</i>

293
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,960
<i>Thirteenth and 17th on the grid.</i>

294
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,160
<i>Ferrari's worst fears in qualifying
have been confirmed.</i>

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,080
How frustrating is it that
you win from pole position here last year

296
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,960
and then down to this position?

297
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,520
That must be heavy for you.

298
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah. I mean, it's tough
because once you do a good lap

299
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,200
and then you do P13, it doesn't feel good,

300
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,400
and, uh, yeah, I mean,
it hurts even more once it's at home,

301
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,960
but it's a reality at the moment
for us, unfortunately.

302
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,640
Seb, you didn't finish your second run.

303
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,640
No.

304
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,200
I was in the middle of the mess,
so there was no point to do it.

305
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,280
Yeah.

306
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,960
That's what it was, a very short day.

307
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,880
You can call it frustration,
but at the end of the day,

308
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,200
on power, we are probably worse off
than we were last year

309
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,880
and the unsatisfying,
most unsatisfying bit

310
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,840
is that you didn't get
to prove to yourself,

311
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,680
"Okay, what could I do today?"

312
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,000
You know, how close to the top
or how far up could I have gone?

313
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,976
- The pole's above your head.
- What?

314
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,720
You have a mic above your head.

315
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,120
But yeah, it's not easy.

316
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
I don't know how it will be tomorrow.

317
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,640
- Well, yeah, look at Vettel.
- Yeah.

318
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,560
He didn't do the last lap.

319
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,720
It's okay, they can't read our lips.

320
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,880
No, but be careful,
you have a mic above your head.

321
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,480
We missed many opportunities.

322
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,280
Certainly the pressure was there.

323
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,720
Obviously, the car is not as good
as we would have wished.

324
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,160
I think Seb's got
some difficulties with the car.

325
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,560
Lack of confidence.

326
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,640
And Charles' car was not performing.

327
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,080
No grip, so, you know, difficult
to really be fast around the lap.

328
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,400
So, we had a poor quali, very poor.

329
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,520
It's a tough time for Ferrari.
There's been a lot of mudslinging,

330
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,560
a lot of accusations
regarding the "secret settlement."

331
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,600
I was wondering how you cope with that?

332
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,680
Honestly, I think
there is a lot of bullshit around it.

333
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,720
- Yeah.
- A lot of rumors.

334
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,840
It's very simple. There have been never
a breach of regulations.

335
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,800
<i>Leclerc's on the inside,
Hamilton goes onto the gravel,</i>

336
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,960
<i>and you can hear the cheers from Monza.</i>

337
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,880
<i>The Ferrari fans loved it.</i>

338
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,880
Ferrari came out of the break last year
firing on all cylinders.

339
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,640
<i>Charles Leclerc won
in Spa. He wins in Monza.</i>

340
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,200
They basically built a car
with a rocket ship in the back of it.

341
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,520
<i>Ferrari coming on strong
in the second part of this season.</i>

342
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,000
They were going so fast
that nobody could quite believe it.

343
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,640
<i>Vettel is going for it.</i>

344
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,880
<i>The Ferrari's speed is giving Hamilton
a lot to think about.</i>

345
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,880
<i>Ferrari have won three races in a row.</i>

346
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,160
Well, we highlighted certain things
to the FIA, together with Mercedes,

347
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,280
that... that we felt
that they should be looking at.

348
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,960
The other teams couldn't work out
exactly how or what,

349
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,880
but they knew something was up.

350
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,320
All of a sudden, in Austin,

351
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,080
we got rumblings of a technical directive
all about fuel flow coming from the FIA,

352
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,400
which is basically a rule clarification,

353
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,600
that says you can, you cannot do this.

354
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,720
<i>I tell you who's on their back foot,</i>

355
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,760
<i>you've got to say Charles Leclerc,
just trying to get a handle on this car.</i>

356
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,120
<i>Let me know
if you can faster, question.</i>

357
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,480
I don't think I can.

358
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,800
And then no power.

359
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,960
<i>Vettel can barely keep up,
he's so slow down the straight.</i>

360
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,000
How was that?

361
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,280
Shit. Uh, that's how I call that.

362
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,920
I really don't know what happened.
I think there was really something weird.

363
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
<i>Ferrari is coming under fire</i>

364
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,240
<i>because allegedly, they have been
gaining an advantage with their engine.</i>

365
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,080
<i>The other teams are not happy about it.</i>

366
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,640
<i>They did conduct an investigation,
came to a conclusion,</i>

367
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,520
<i>reached a settlement with Ferrari,
but aren't disclosing the details of that.</i>

368
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,640
We were surprised
at the statement from the FIA.

369
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,960
We're pushing for full disclosure of that.

370
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,280
The FIA haven't found the team guilty

371
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,920
of any specific wrongdoing.

372
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,280
Are you disappointed then
that they didn't clear the team?

373
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,120
I trust my team
to do the right things

374
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,520
and we trust the FIA to do their job.

375
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,920
I fully trust my team

376
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,480
uh, and I trust the FIA
for making sure everything was okay,

377
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,880
so for me, yes, it's, uh, it's done,
and now I look to the future.

378
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,880
They don't have the power
that they had before, that's clear,

379
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,400
and they don't seem
to be in a happy place at the moment.

380
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,760
From the outside,
not knowing why the deal was secret,

381
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,280
it looks like Ferrari had
an unfair advantage

382
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,040
that the FIA took away.

383
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,680
People say,
"Why you don't change engine supplier?"

384
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,680
I think that is not what I call reality.

385
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,000
Going forward,
we are staying with Ferrari,

386
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,000
even if, in the moment it isn't...

387
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,760
I mean, uh, uh... easy

388
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,600
They helped us a lot in the beginning,
so now, we need to help them

389
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,520
and be loyal and...
and a little bit patient.

390
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,360
When you look
at the relative performance

391
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,680
from last year to this year,

392
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,800
I think it's self-explanatory.

393
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,760
Some team principals
have suggested

394
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,560
that the 2019 car or engine wasn't legal.

395
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,080
Honestly,
I don't think there is much to add.

396
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,400
The point is closed.

397
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,040
<i>This is a beautiful day in Monza</i>

398
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,360
<i>as we prepare for round eight
of the Formula 1 World Championship.</i>

399
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,480
I'm having a romantic conversation
with my girlfriend. You can't record this.

400
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,400
<i>You have to go back to 1984</i>

401
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,680
<i>as the last time two Ferraris
started outside the top ten</i>

402
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,400
<i>at their home Grand Prix.</i>

403
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,800
Test Vettel mic.
Test, one, two.

404
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,040
I want to see how far I can dig.

405
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,240
- Yeah. Okay, cool.
- See what we get.

406
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,560
2020, for Sebastian and Ferrari,

407
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,960
it just hasn't quite clicked,
it hasn't quite meshed.

408
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,640
Okay. Okay.

409
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
We can see you now. <i>Perfetto.</i>

410
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,400
There is no way
that a Ferrari should be 17th...

411
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,960
They are coming from there.

412
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,240
They are just there now,
so if you want to film them...

413
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,520
...or that Sebastian Vettel is...

414
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,840
that far off.

415
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,120
Seb's a four-time world champion

416
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,720
and one of the most ruthless,

417
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,400
brilliantly effective racing drivers
that I've ever seen.

418
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
How are you?

419
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,680
- Good.
- Good. Good.

420
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,080
You don't lose that ability overnight.

421
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,120
Seb, um, I think
you're a very morally guided person.

422
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,720
I think you have a good heart
and a good direction.

423
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,000
Well, I think you have to
have your principles, so I think, uh,

424
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,960
yes, as much as I want to succeed

425
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,720
and I want myself to have success
rather than others,

426
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,240
I play by certain rules.

427
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,640
And, you know,
one of those rules are I have to be fair,

428
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,800
and if being successful
means that I have to break these rules,

429
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,600
then it wouldn't feel right.

430
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,280
It's like cheating, in the end,
and you are cheating yourself, so...

431
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,200
Do you think everyone
plays to the same rules that you do?

432
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,200
I can't answer.

433
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,160
Take control of it yourself.

434
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,040
- Should be your decision.
- Yeah.

435
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,536
- You know?
- It is.

436
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,920
- You're still young enough.
- Yeah.

437
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,800
Seb leaving Ferrari,
what's going on there?

438
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,240
Just take a moment to pause.

439
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,680
- And then come home.
- Exactly. All right.

440
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,920
See you later.

441
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,680
Yeah, it's, I'm sure,
a question that you'll be asking him.

442
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,760
Sebastian Vettel is out of a seat.

443
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,240
He has nowhere to go.

444
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,280
Up and down the paddock,
everybody was trying to work out

445
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,600
what was he gonna do.

446
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,560
Would he leave Formula 1?
Would he find another team?

447
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,200
Sebastian is
a great personality who, uh,

448
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,000
shaped the last ten years in Formula 1.

449
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,920
Simply the fact that Sebastian's available
is worth the discussion.

450
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,520
Frankly,
I'm good friends with Seb.

451
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,600
I knew him
from before he was a Formula 1 driver

452
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,480
and, uh, for a very long time.

453
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,920
He's still a young man and very talented.

454
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,520
It'd be, uh, a shame
not to see him on the grid next season.

455
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,120
I remember Sebastian Vettel,
when he was driving for us,

456
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,440
came from more than 40 points behind
to beat Fernando Alonso

457
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
to the 2012 World Championship.

458
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,880
We don't write anything off.
Literally anything can happen.

459
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Let's hope
he doesn't lose motivation.

460
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes, we need to keep him focused.

461
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,320
As a team principal,
my challenge certainly is

462
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,480
make sure that the external comments
are not affecting the morale of the team.

463
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,840
It was a very difficult quali.

464
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,920
Uh, I understand...

465
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,000
the disappointment of the people around,

466
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,600
but more important to stay focused.

467
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
Okay. Back of the grid.

468
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,040
<i>And radio check.</i>

469
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,360
Yeah. One, two, radio check okay.

470
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,600
Ah, it's not the first time
I started at the back of the grid.

471
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,520
I believe that there's always a chance.

472
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,240
Sunday, when you stand on the grid,
even if you're not in a great position,

473
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,720
you never know what happens.

474
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,400
If you are racing in P10
and the nine cars in front of you retire,

475
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,600
you win the race.

476
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,320
Ferrari's not so good
in the straight.

477
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,320
- Unbelievable!
- Fucking hell.

478
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,400
<i>And radio check, Charles.</i>

479
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,280
To be honest,
I think it would be a mistake

480
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,080
for me to put extra pressure
because I'm driving for Ferrari.

481
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,000
<i>Radio check. Can you hear me?</i>

482
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,080
What I have to do in this situation
is to try and maximize what I have.

483
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,120
Radio check.

484
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,920
Whoa. Wasn't plugged in.

485
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
<i>No problem.</i>

486
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,080
When I close the visor,
I try to extract all of those thoughts

487
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,200
to be 100% focused on the goal.

488
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,280
I think emotion was going up.

489
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,400
The pressure was there.

490
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
No doubt.

491
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,200
Because we knew
that Monza was important for us.

492
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,800
<i>And we're underway
for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.</i>

493
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,920
<i>Great getaway for Lewis Hamilton.
Up to second place goes Carlos Sainz.</i>

494
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,280
<i>Bottas down to third.</i>

495
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,520
<i>Charles Leclerc is losing a position
to Kimi Räikkönen.</i>

496
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,200
<i>Alex Albon getting it
all wrong in that first chicane</i>

497
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,080
<i>and losing places as a result.</i>

498
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,920
<i>Charles Leclerc on the inside
of Kimi Räikkönen, looking for a gap.</i>

499
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,480
<i>That soon disappears.</i>

500
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,640
Any feedback on the starts?

501
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,960
You are P13. P13.

502
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,840
<i>Lap five of 53.</i>

503
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,640
<i>Hamilton's lead is three seconds</i>

504
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,960
<i>over the McLaren of Carlos Sainz
in second place.</i>

505
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
<i>Here's Vettel.</i>

506
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,480
<i>Russell, 0.7 behind.</i>

507
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Copy.

508
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,920
<i>Sebastian Vettel
who's still down in 17th, under pressure.</i>

509
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,320
<i>DRS enabled.</i>

510
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,320
<i>Vettel does not have DRS.</i>

511
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,240
Yeah, copy.

512
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,760
<i>And we are very hot
on the left-hand side of the brakes.</i>

513
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,880
<i>Rear left.</i>

514
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,240
Russell, 0.5 behind.

515
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,480
Distance!

516
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,080
<i>Here comes George Russell.</i>

517
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,760
<i>Vett has smoking from behind.
I'm not sure if he's dropping oil.</i>

518
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,801
- Something wrong, the rear left.
<i>- Copy.</i>

519
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,520
<i>You need to cool down the rears
if you can.</i>

520
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
<i>They've got a problem with the car.</i>

521
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,920
<i>They've got Russell
trying to get past him.</i>

522
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,360
<i>Vettel can't slow it down!</i>

523
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,400
Brakes failed. The brakes failed.

524
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,080
Brakes failed.

525
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh God!

526
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,080
<i>Brake fire.
The brakes are on fire.</i>

527
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,560
No more brake pedal.
Brake line exploded.

528
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,560
I can bring the car back if you want.

529
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,400
We're always in the middle
of any crisis.

530
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,400
<i>End of the day for Vettel,</i>

531
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,760
<i>who's leaving Ferrari
at the end of the season.</i>

532
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,560
<i>His last race as a Ferrari driver at Monza
and he's out on lap eight of 53.</i>

533
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,080
<i>A torturous Italian Grand Prix
for the Scuderia.</i>

534
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,040
<i>They'll hope this is as bad as it's going
to be for them at their home ground.</i>

535
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,480
For Seb,
it has been certainly frustrating.

536
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,040
It's the most important race of the season

537
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,160
and I think that
whoever is a Ferrari driver,

538
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,680
the dream is to win in Monza.

539
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,040
<i>And it is lap 24
of this Italian Grand Prix.</i>

540
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,000
Ferrari is passion
and you can feel it.

541
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,040
It's just unbelievable

542
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
and you don't get that
anywhere else on the grid.

543
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,680
<i>Gap to Räikkönen in front, 0.6.</i>

544
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,760
Copy.

545
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,360
It's our job now
to get back to, uh, to winning.

546
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,280
<i>Leclerc's putting Räikkönen under pressure</i>

547
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,120
<i>behind Antonio Giovinazzi</i>

548
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,200
<i>He's got past Räikkönen.</i>

549
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,760
<i>He might clear two Alfas
in about 300 meters here.</i>

550
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,880
<i>And he does!</i>

551
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,560
<i>Charles Leclerc picks off Räikkönen
and picks off Giovinazzi as well.</i>

552
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,440
<i>Fantastico!</i>

553
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,880
<i>Leclerc may have lost speed.</i>

554
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,760
<i>He hasn't lost any bravery
and commitment, has he?</i>

555
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,520
Confidence in Formula 1,
I think, is everything

556
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,800
because if you are not confident
in your car or your abilities,

557
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,200
then you are going to struggle.

558
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,280
We need to close the gap.
We need to close the gap now.

559
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,000
We are not where we expected to be.
We are not where we want to be.

560
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,560
<i>Try to maximize full throttle.</i>

561
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
I'm...

562
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,200
I'm struggling, guys.

563
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,640
But still, my goal is the same,
to try to put the car on its limit.

564
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,320
<i>Are you okay?</i>

565
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,720
<i>Charles? Can you hear me?</i>

566
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,120
Ah...

567
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,040
Fuck!

568
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
It was very extreme.

569
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,560
I can remember everything
apart from the hit itself.

570
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,320
I think there's a bit of a blackout
for a few seconds.

571
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,840
The hit was pretty hard.

572
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,480
Everything happened,
uh, very, very quickly

573
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,360
and then, unfortunately,
puts all our hopes to the bin.

574
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm sorry, but I...
Honestly, I struggled so much

575
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,560
with the balance.

576
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,840
Fuck!

577
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
Sorry.

578
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,560
Copy.
Main thing is that you're okay.

579
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,840
And go to P0, please, P0.

580
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,416
<i>Leclerc hauls himself out of the car.</i>

581
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,320
<i>It was a long way through the corner</i>

582
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,440
<i>for that to be a brake problem
like Vettel's.</i>

583
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,800
<i>Let's see what did happen.</i>

584
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,480
<i>He's on his own
coming into the Parabolica.</i>

585
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,680
<i>And he just lost it on the power
on the hard tires,</i>

586
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,560
<i>and driver error.</i>

587
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,400
<i>What a horrible, horrible
Italian Grand Prix for the Scuderia.</i>

588
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,680
How bad a result
was this for Ferrari?

589
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,320
It was one of the most horrible weekends
they've had in a very long time.

590
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,000
It's a huge fall from grace
for Ferrari

591
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,200
because this is a team
that should be fighting Mercedes

592
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,560
and yet, they cannot compete with anybody.

593
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,120
It was a difficult weekend
which concluded even in the worst way.

594
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,400
Obviously,
we are all unhappy and disappointed.

595
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,280
It's poor, obviously,

596
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,720
where we are,
especially here, for our home race.

597
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,240
It's probably a blessing
there's nobody in the stand.

598
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,800
We are very united.

599
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,400
I don't think
there are even tensions inside the team.

600
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,840
There are no shortcuts in life.

601
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,680
We are in this position
because we probably deserve to be.

602
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,520
I think
that I can feel the team behind me.

603
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,880
Very committed.

604
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,920
Now, it's down to us to...
to prove that we are capable.

605
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,640
<i>Welcome
to the second Italian race of the season</i>

606
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,000
<i>and a milestone in motor racing.</i>

607
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,480
<i>Ferrari's 1000th Grand Prix.</i>

608
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,480
<i>And they're preparing
to celebrate in style.</i>

609
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,760
Ferrari has been always there
since the very start.

610
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,840
Never stopping since 1950
when the F1 started.

611
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,840
I think whatever difficulties
we've got at the moment,

612
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,320
it's important to celebrate

613
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,760
because we are celebrating
an entire history

614
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,680
and a fantastic milestone.

615
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,400
And if you've got such a history,
somehow you are special.

616
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,920
This is Ferrari's 1000th race.

617
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,800
The party, the displays.

618
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,040
They are a huge, huge corporation,
making millions of pounds.

619
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,680
This is the time to shine.

620
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,040
<i>As the sun rises
on a beautiful Tuscan morning,</i>

621
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,840
<i>news that Sebastian Vettel
has signed for Aston Martin.</i>

622
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,960
Seb, we understand you didn't even
put pen to paper until last night.

623
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,760
For me, it was important
that I sign up for something I believe in.

624
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,200
Today, it's been announced

625
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,600
that I'll have a seat,
I'll be on the grid next year.

626
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,400
I'm looking forward to a new challenge.

627
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,160
I'm a competitor,
so if I wasn't convinced

628
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,440
that I can be competitive
with Aston Martin,

629
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,520
I think, uh, you know,
life is treating me far too good

630
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,400
uh, to drag on and to keep suffering.

631
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,240
Bonjour.

632
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,800
Okay, well, of course,
the big news we all know now

633
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,560
that Sebastian has a seat and a team
for next year and beyond.

634
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,800
And beyond?

635
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,880
- Big news this morning.
- Good.

636
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,960
Good to have you around.
We have done a post for you, saying...

637
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,120
Yeah, I saw, thank you.
Yeah. Thank you, Silvia.

638
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,560
No, not "Thank you, Silvia,"
it's all of us.

639
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,560
Now, uh, in terms of the, um, timing
of the announcement, Sebastian.

640
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,160
We had quite a lot of people say,

641
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,120
"Sebastian, you know,
announced this on this day,"

642
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,040
and everything.

643
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,960
Of course, we believe it was triggered
by last night's announcement from Perez,

644
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,720
which came out so late.
It was obviously a last-minute thing,

645
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,360
so this is our position when we get asked.

646
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,360
- Yeah. It's the truth as well.
- Okay.

647
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,800
The timing probably tells you everything.

648
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,720
He probably couldn't have picked
a more inappropriate time...

649
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,240
...for the team,
but I guess he was pissed off.

650
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,400
So, on my side,

651
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,600
I have, uh, um, some Information
about Saturday evening,

652
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,440
the event that we will have in Firenze.

653
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,600
It's mandatory, guys, to be sharp

654
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,840
because we will have a lot
of important Ferrari family guests there,

655
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,840
so we cannot really be late.

656
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,800
It kind of takes the shine
off Ferrari's big celebration,

657
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,240
but it puts the focus back on Sebastian.

658
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,800
I think Sebastian Vettel feels

659
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,760
that with Racing Point,
which will become Aston Martin next year,

660
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,840
he can build this team up
to be incredible.

661
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,920
The future now is very exciting.

662
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,840
My number one ambition is
to be at the front of the grid,

663
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,720
fight for something worth fighting for
and have fun and enjoy.

664
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,320
I think
Ferrari has always proved

665
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,480
to be capable
of reacting to the difficulties.

666
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,280
Uh, we know that we need
to turn that into determination.

667
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,240
We are still investing in the future,
committed to creating solid foundations.

668
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,440
My job is to help the team.
Miracles don't happen in Formula 1,

669
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,440
so we need to stay focused on what we do.

670
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,120
I believe that if we continue to work
step by step in the right direction,

671
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,400
we'll manage to be
in a much better position for next year.

672
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,840
Ferrari is a legendary brand.

673
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,480
Ferrari have always been part
of motor racing.

674
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,680
Ferrari is somehow unique,
and Ferrari is a family.

675
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,240
And being a family,
somehow, it's a passion.

676
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,280
We are a great team
and we will develop the right car.

677
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,400
That's what makes me confident

678
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,160
that we can certainly do better
in the future.

679
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,776
<i>The big news of the week is
that Ricciardo is on his way to McLaren.</i>

680
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,720
Is Cyril talking to you yet?

681
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,960
With the breakup, I am emotional.

682
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,480
It's like being dumped by a girlfriend,
but she hasn't moved out the house yet.

683
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Pierre's confidence
has completely transformed.

684
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,120
I wanted to prove myself
as a driver.

685
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,480
I deserve to go back to Red Bull.

686
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,600
Fuck yes!

687
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,320
<i>Haas's problems continue.</i>

688
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,920
In a season like this,
small mistakes have big consequences.

689
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,320
If you're not good enough,
you will be spat out.
