12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,333
the detective exam
was just announced?

13
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:30,856
- Yeah, I heard something
about that.

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,989

is brutal.

15

- Really?
- Yeah.

start studying now.

or anything, right?

the supplementary reports.

That's how I know you got
those kids out of harm's way.

Aqueela Barnes.

to be a cop.

61
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:15,265
- Oh. Okay, I can arrange
a ride along with Patrol.

62
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:17,572
- Or you could take
her out yourself.

you must be, ma'am.

- Ooh, let's lose
the "ma'am," okay?

86
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:13,236
- Oh--sorry.
My mom likes me to be formal.

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,151
- That's okay.
Grab your backpack.

88
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,848
It's cute. K for Kendra?

- So why do you wanna
be a cop, Kendra?

92
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:27,337
- I'm just tired
of people being shot.

93
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,774
So, rather than bitch
and moan and just--

94
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:33,517
Oh, sorry.

95
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:36,216
- That's okay.
Cops are allowed to curse.

96
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:40,263
- Well, rather than complain,

97
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,352
I just figured I'd
do something about it.

00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:49,409
- And that's the one
that hit the pedestrian?

176
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,236
- Yeah, bad time for a walk.

177
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,456
McCaffery fires back,
clips Offender Number One.

178
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,066
Meet Clay Young.

179
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,546
- Do we know what happened
to the second offender?

180
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,156
- He hightails it
through a side door,

181
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,549
engages with Officer Burgess.

182
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:01,769
- Okay. Anything else?
- Talked to Robbery.

183

is the same crew

184

that's been hitting the Gold
Coast the past few weeks.

Hey, uh, what about the wife?

188
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:13,563
- Once the shooting started,
I hid in the bathroom.

189
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,043
I should have done
something.

190
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,740
- No, no. You didn't
do anything wrong.

191
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:19,264
- I tried to save him--
- Detective?

192
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:20,744

193
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:23,138

what do we got?

197
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,103
- Two offenders
that we know of.

198
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,496
They came in through
the back courtyard.

199
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,845
The wife didn't see much.

200
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,804
- We've got
two DOAs inside.

201
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:39,502
The homeowner, John McCaffery,
and one of the bad guys.

202
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:42,897
A, uh, Clay Young,
male, white, 37.

203
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,552
He's got a long sheet.
Burglary. Meth distro.

204

No gang ties, though.

205
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:49,294
Wife said her husband
had a gun,

206
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,732
and he's the one that opened
fire on this Clay Young guy.

207
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,473
- And during the shootout,
a bullet came through

208
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,909
the window and
hit a civilian here.

209
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,606
- Wife get a look a look
at the other offender?

210
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,955
- She caught a glimpse, but
she ducked into the bathroom

211
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,479
when the bullets
started flying.

212
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,784
She said, white male,
tall, gray hoodie.

213
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,525
- Same guy that opened
up on Kim.

214
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,005
I have two witnesses
that saw a big guy

215
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,528
with a gray hoodie
run out of the house,

216
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,095
shooting at
a police officer.

217
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,966

- Look, it all happened
really fast, okay?

221
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,236
There was a man
down, bleeding.

222
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,977
I told Kendra to duck,
to stay in the car--

223
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,805
- Hold on a second, the girl
was in the car with you?

224
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,851
- Yeah, I was
on a ride along.

225
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,635
But now I can't find her.

226
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,984
I went back to check on her,
and she's gone--

227
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,072

with me, she ran.

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,411
- Well, just find her.
- I've been looking.

Maybe she took the bus home.

- Mrs. Barnes,
I'm officer Burgess.

250
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,389
We spoke yesterday.
There's been an incident--

251
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,217
Kendra!
Are you okay?

252
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:28,524
Mrs. Barnes,
may I please come in?

253
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,613
I would love to speak
to Kendra.

254
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,617
- I'm sorry about
all of this.

255
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,053
When that guy started
shooting at you,

256
00:09:36,097 --> 00:09:37,098
I got scared.

257
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,708
So, I ran into
a coffee shop,

258
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,580
and I started freaking out
a little bit.

259
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,451
But then this nice lady
walked into the bus stop.

260
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,192
Gave me some money,
and told me to go home.

261
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:45,759
- So, let me get this
straight, Officer Burgess.

262
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,717
You were out with
my daughter on a ride,

263
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,806
and you drove smack-dab
into a shootout?

264
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,721
How does that happen?
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Barnes.

265
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:53,375
I certainly didn't mean
for this to happen.

266
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,638
There was an emergency call,
a man was shot.

267

I did what I thought
was right--

268
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,033
- No disrespect,
Ms. Barnes, but my partner

269
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:01,557
is being extremely humble.
She tried to save a man's life.

270
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,212
- And almost got my daughter
killed in the process.

271
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:05,561
- Mom.

272
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,823
I appreciate you
stopping by.

273
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:07,955
But if there's nothing else--

274
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,652
- There is.
I'm sorry.

275
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,132
Kendra, I have to ask you:
did you happen to see

276
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:13,308
the man with the gun?
He was wearing a gray hoodie.

277
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:19,314
- No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.

278
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:20,445
- There.

279
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,143
- Thank you.

280
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,626
- So, we recovered a laptop
in Clay Young's apartment that

281
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,150
traces back to a Gold Coast
robbery from two weeks ago.

282
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,673
- Well, that's good.
But Young's dead.

283
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,675
Do we have anything on
the second offender?

284
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,634
- Nothing so far.
- Nah, we got a name.

285
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:36,287
This is, uh,
Trent Stow.

286

- Record?
- Long and impressive.

288
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:42,424
He's a repeat violent
offender, this guy.

289
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:44,818
- Two armed robberies,
three narcotics charges.

290
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,471
Looks like he's into
meth, coke, and heroin.

291
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,299
- All right. That makes sense,
'cause the M.E. said

292
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,214
they found high doses
of meth in Young's system.

293
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:52,347
- All right. So we've
got two hopped-up junkies

294
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,957
robbing to support their habit.

295
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:57,178
Besides drugs, we find
a nexus between Stow and Young?

296
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,876
- Yeah, they were busted
ten years ago for a robbery

297
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,356
when they were
in college at CCU.

298
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,271
Stow actually played
quarterback for a season.

299
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:05,055
- He was a pro prospect
until he beat

300

a kid into a coma at a bar.

301
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:09,233
The judge was an alum,
so he got off with probation.

302
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:10,887
- He's been busted a few
times for robberies,

303
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,193

304
