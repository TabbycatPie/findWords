你说得对  也没那么...

一年前的今天  我有机会成为英雄
One year ago today, I had the chance to be a hero.

33
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,420
那是年度高中慈善篮球比赛
It was the annual high school charity basketball game --

34
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,890
家长对战老师
parents versus teachers.

35
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,830
我们在为出勤率办公室的马丁太太筹钱

One minute it was present, the next it was absent.

38
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,830
我们落后两分  比赛只剩一秒钟  我来罚球
Down 2, a second left, I was fouled.

39
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,240
胜负就在我手中
The game was in my hands.

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,090
在巨大的压力之下  我掉链子了
I crumbled under the pressure.

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,560
这赎罪的机会我等了一年
I've waited a year for my shot at redemption

42
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,420
这次我不要留任何弱点

下手重点
Harder!

44
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,910
我像疯子一样锻炼
I have worked out like a madman --

传球运球训练  敏捷训练
passing and dribbling drills, agility training...

46
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,280
最厉害的是  我每天练习100个罚球

00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,610
怎么不说别告诉爸爸
What about "Don't tell Papa?"

55
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,620
男孩应该害怕自己的父亲
A boy is supposed to fear his father.

56
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,480
在我爸爸身边  我瑟瑟发抖
I shook in my boots around my old man,

57
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,010
他在他爸爸身边也是如此
just like he did around his.

58
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,320
直到今天  我听见打开施丽兹啤酒的声音
To this day, I hear the crack of a Schlitz

59
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,750
或者闻到辛格尔顿须后水的味道时

60
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,510
都会像小意大利区的黑帮叛徒一样浑身出汗

要我跟你说多少次你才会捡起你的玩具
How many times have I told you to pick up your toys?

69
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,310
她就是典型的金发傻帽芭比娃娃医生

70
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,850
你好啊  唐娜
Hola, Donna.

71
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,600
你是不小心逛到这里来了吗
Did you wander in by mistake?

72
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,110
这里可不卖鞋
You know they don't sell shoes here.

73
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,740
天啊  你买这么多热狗
Oh, no, I see you buy a lot of hot dogs.

74
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,330
你就这样放弃保持身材真是太惨了
It's so sad when someone just gives up.

今年我们要为她筹钱换肾

So, can we count on you?

79
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,310
捐肾吗
For the kidney?

80
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,190
写张捐款支票  就跟你以前一样
To write a check, like you always do.

81

捐钱几乎算得上和做实事一样好呢
Money is almost as good as actually doing something.

83
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,020
房地产拍卖会上40美元买的  你敢信吗

84
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,670
你根本不会发现是拍卖品
Like, there's no way you'd even notice.

85

你能相信厄尔的蠢货女儿
Can you believe Earl's dum-dum daughter

99
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,480
从那些笨蛋手里买了木材吗

100
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,830
当然啦  你俩长大时
Of course, when you two were growing up,

101
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,560

我就知道那木头这么划算  肯定有鬼
I knew that deal was too good to be true.

107
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,090
现在我看起来就要跟一个
And now I'm gonna look as stupid as a girl

108
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,320
把班里的两只兔子都抚摸死的女孩一样蠢了
who pet two different class rabbits to death.

109
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,450
喝点茶吗  先生
A spot of tea, sir?

110
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,340
是上等的我就喝
Only if it's the fancy kind.

111
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,310
我的天
Oh, my God.

112
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,630
我们的英音都变得这么熟练了
How good have our accents gotten?

113
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,990
-太不可思议了  -是啊
- It's insane. - Yeah.

114
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,260
海莉4岁的时候  我们办了第一次茶话会
When Haley was 4, she and I had our first tea party,

115
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,410
从那以后  我们把茶话会变成了传统
and since then, we've made it a tradition

116
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,290
每年都一起喝一次下午茶
to meet for high tea once a year.

117
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,730
我真的很珍惜这些时光
It's a time I've really come to cherish.

118
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,150
我不喜欢他们这个什么茶话会
I don't love the whole tea thing.

119
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,980
米奇尔和海莉总是分享秘密
Mitchell and Haley always come back giggling

120
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,620
说说笑笑地回来  我觉得我被排挤在外
over shared secrets, and I feel left out.

121
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,750
我试过自己搞一个舅舅侄女传统活动  但
I once tried to start my own uncle-niece tradition, but...

122
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,460
我不是质疑加速质谱法
I'm not questioning the methodology

123
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,310
背后的方法论
behind accelerated mass spectrometry.

124
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,190
我只是单纯指出不是只有这个方法
I'm merely pointing out that it's not singular

125
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,950
才能够从丰度高的其他同位素中
in its power to separate a rare isotope

126
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,790
分离出稀有的同位素
from an abundant neighboring mass.

127
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,280
你和那个帅气的天气预报员交往得怎么样

128
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,300
大部分时候都很好
Things are great, mostly.

129
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,920
挺好的

130
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,180
"大部分时候"
Oh. "mostly"?

131
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,830
遇到什么问题了吗
Well, what's-what's going on?

132
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,870
你能接受你的伴侣
I mean, do you think it's okay for your partner

133
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,950
对你提出的任何要求吗
to ask you to do... anything?

134
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,430
不能  不是任何要求都能接受
Mm, no. Not anything anything.

135
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,760
我们都有个人界限
I mean, we all have our boundaries.

136
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,070
还是有些事是我不会叫小卡去做的
I mean, there are still things I wouldn't ask Cam to do.

137
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,200
好吧  是这样的  某天晚上
Okay. So, um, Rainer and I

138
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,740
雷纳和我躺在床上  然后...
were in bed the other night, and...

139
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,460
然后怎么
And?

140
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,520
他叫我做某件
He asked me to do something

141
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,740
让我有点不舒服的事
I'm not totally comfortable with.

142
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,910
他叫你做什么了
What'd he ask you to do?

143
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,530
我不会评头论足的  你准备好了再说
No-No judgments. Just whenever you're ready.

144
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,420
他当时侧躺着
So, he was lying on his side,

145
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,880
他说要以那种体位才能做
and he said that that was part of it,

146
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,700
然后他叫我c...
and then he asked me to c-

147
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,600
海莉
Haley!

148
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,960
他叫你做什么
What'd he ask you to do?

149
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,940
快  写在这张餐巾纸上
Quick, write it down on this napkin.

150
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,410
雷纳  你怎么来了
Rainer, what are you doing here?

151
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,210
你把耳机落在我车里了
You left your earbuds in my car.

152
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,140
我知道你喜欢以它们为借口来无视别人
I know you like to use them to ignore people.

153
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,640
你想和我们一起喝茶吗
Do you want to join us?

154
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,110
-你不介意吧  米奇舅舅  -怎么会
- You don't mind, do you, Uncle Mitch? - No!

155
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,960
{\an8}老大姐在看着你  肾脏

156
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,320
回到这里的感觉太奇怪了
It feels weird to be back here.

157
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,730
我曾败在这间体育馆里
This gym got the better of me once.

158
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,800
爸  你又要把自己逼疯了
Dad, you're psyching yourself out.

159
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,470
你说得对
You're right.

160
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,480
今年与去年唯一的区别
The only thing different between this year and last

161
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,080
是今年我有备而来
is I'm prepared this year.

162
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,810
德安德鲁·乔丹和查尔斯·巴克利也来了
And DeAndre Jordan and Charles Barkley are here.

163
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,530
这里是往手上盖已买票章的地方吗
Is this where we get our hand stamped?

164
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,010
有时候我喜欢去别的地方逛逛再回来
Sometimes I like to leave and come back to things.

165
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,360
你们怎么来了
Uh, why-why are you here?

166
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,720
我们经纪人的妻子是这所学校的数学老师
Our agent's wife is a math teacher at the school.

167
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,810
咱去占座吧
Let's go get our seats.

168
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,380
我们不想被人们挡住视线
We don't want anybody to block us.

169
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,680
是啊  我懂
Yeah, yeah. I-I get that.

170
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,800
所以我得在大牌职篮球星面前打球吗
So, I'm playing in front of two NBA stars?

171
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,420
还有  一旦人们听说他们在这
Plus, once people know they're here,

172
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,740
围观群众肯定会比去年多五倍
the crowd will be like five times the size it was last year.

173
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,630
消防局长不会让这么多人挤在馆里的
Well, we still live in a world with a fire marshal.

174
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,800
等等
Wait.

175
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,980
没准他们只是来露个脸
They're probably just here to show their faces

176
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,710
站个台就走了
and make a quick exit...

177
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,100
爸  别被他们影响
Dad, don't let them faze you.

178
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,440
你为此艰苦训练过
This is what you've trained for.

179
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,430
你准备好了
You're ready.

180
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,190
你说得对
You're right.

181
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,530
我只要放松一下就好了
I just need to shake the jitters off a little bit.

182
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,960
交给我  拉里
I got you, Larry.

183
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,160
定点跳投
Spot up.

184
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,600
不
No!

185
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,680
歌洛莉亚  真的是你吗
Gloria? Is that you?

186
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,360
我的大脑不能接受你出现在此情此景里
My brain's having a hard time processing you in this context.

187
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,410
我来卖玉米片筹善款
Yeah, I came to sell my nachos to raise money.

188
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,760
你人真好
How nice.

189
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,840
尽管有人说你的努力来得太迟太少
Although, some people are saying it's too little too late,

190
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,550
你不能来露个脸就指望能记上一功
that you can't just show up and get credit for it.

191
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,710
我觉得这些话很刻薄
I think it's mean,

192
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,550
但有些人说你看起来有点虚伪
but some people are saying it seems disingenuous.

193
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,350
我刚到这
I just got here.

194
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,300
你是什么时候听这些人说这些话的
When did you talk to all these people?

195
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,760
我认为你会发现这些人
I think you'll find this crowd

196
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,340
不宣[喜欢]玉米片
no lika da nachos.

197
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,060
如果你觉得学口音很种族歧视  我感到抱歉
I'm sorry if that sounds racist.

198
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,580
才没有呢
No, it didn't.

199
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:34,160
我根本就没听出你在取笑哪种语言
I don't even know what language you were trying to make fun of.

200
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,300
既然你不打算走  你可以在那支个摊
Okay, since you're not leaving, you can set up down there.

201
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,080
不
No.

202
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,790
那好黑  还很偏
It's very dark, and it's very far away!

203
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:42,610
祝你好运
Good luck!

204
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,890
看起来我发的咱仨的合照
Looks like that picture I Instagrammed of the three of us

205
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,770
挺受我粉丝欢迎呢
is a big hit with Rainer Nation.

206
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,800
你就这么发定位安全吗
And is it safe to post your location like that?

207
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,280
你难道不担心有人跟踪你
Aren't you worried about stalkers?

208
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,190
不会  没事的
Oh, no, it's fine.

209
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,140
我的大多数粉丝
Most of my followers

210
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,580
都是些过度兴奋  极端缺爱的老女人
are just overly excited, love-starved old ladies.

211
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,970
你们的独家茶话会对外开放了啊
Oh, I see your exclusive tea party opened up.

212
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,260
他才刚发推特
He just posted that.

213
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,870
你是在餐厅外兜圈等待吗
What, are you circling the restaurant?

214
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,130
你好  雷纳·向恩
Hey, Rainer Shine.

215
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,690
感恩节的时候你就坐他旁边
You sat next to him at Thanksgiving.

216
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,650
对对  曼尼  快坐  一起啊
Right! Manny! Sit down. Join us.

217
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,860
小卡  咱俩能单独聊会儿吗
Actually, Cam, could I talk to you for a second?

218
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,190
雷纳来之前
Okay, before Rainer walked in,

219
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,690
海莉正要说雷纳让她做的
Haley was about to tell me something upsetting

220
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,960
在床上某件令她感到略不舒服的事  
he asked her to do in the bedroom.

221
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,530
我没听到太多  他让她...
Now, I didn't get much, but he asked her to c--

222
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,030
什么
To what?

223
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,390
他让她...
He asked her to c--

224
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,480
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

225
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,010
都不要再靠近我俩了  谢谢合作
Okay, no one else come near us. Thank you.

226
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,610
她就说了个c  然后雷纳就闯进来了
That's all she got out -- "C--." And then Rainer walked in.

227
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,310
我们必须得问清楚
Well, we have to find out.

228
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,510
作为她的舅舅  我们要掌握尽多的情况
As her uncles, we need all the information we can

229
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,980
这样才能更好地给她作指导啊
so we can advise her properly.

230
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,420
没错  她约会对象比她大好多
Yeah. She's dating an older man.

231
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,990
如果她不舒服  咱们有责任保护她
If she's uncomfortable, it's our duty to protect her.

232
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,430
好  那咱们达成一致
Okay. So we said all that.

233
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,370
c开头的词都有啥啊
What could "C--" be?

234
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,130
-萝卜  -不对
-Carrot? -Mnh-mnh.

235
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,260
杯吸法
Cupping?

236
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,520
你不会觉得是加拿大长跳吧
You don't think it could be a Canadian long jump, do you?

237
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,330
这招里并没有需要女人的地方啊
What part would a woman play in that?

238
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,470
这是最后一份文件线索
That's the last of the paper trail.

239
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,000
干得漂亮
Great.

240
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,030
这个地图上的红别针标的
Okay, and so the red pins on this map mark

241
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,680
是有毒木材制成的衣柜
all the locations of closets

242
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,300
所发往的地点
that were made with the toxic wood.

243
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,740
我们已经召回了
Okay, and we have recalled

244
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,500
十个里我们已经召回九个了
9 out of 10 of the contaminated closets,

245
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,790
我们只需追踪剩下的最后一个
so we only have to track down one more.

246
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,330
既然你没问  绿色别针
And since you didn't ask, the green pins

247
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,060
是我所有的潜在父亲的住址
are all the addresses of potential fathers of mine.

248
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,810
你们在干嘛呢
Oh, hey. How're you doing?

249
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,390
我听说有人没登记就用了我的粉碎机
Did I hear somebody using my shredder without signing it out?

250
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,020
没
No.

251
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,620
碎纸屑
Confetti!!

252
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,550
那孩子完全不怕我
Hey! The kid doesn't fear me as he should,

253
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,390
所以我把他带到这
so I brought him in here

254
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,650
让他看看我霸道总裁的一面
to show him my scary boss side.

255
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,570
-配合点  -好的
-Play along. -Okay.

256
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,110
本  你觉得我是有多傻
Ben, how dumb do you think I am?

257
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,870
你发现了吗
You found out?

258
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,490
我当然发现了  我啥都知道
Of course I found out. I know everything.

259
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,460
全是她的主意
It was her idea!

260
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,840
-本  -不  他做得很好
-Ben! -No, he's doing great.

261
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,280
你惹上大麻烦了  小子
You're in big trouble, mister.

262
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,910
杰  真的对不起  我们正要尽力
Jay, I'm so sorry. We were just trying to s--

263
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,060
够了
Enough!

264
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,020
我们走  乔
Come on, Joe!

265
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,310
够了
Enough!

266
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,170
你招供速度还能再更快点吗
Could you have rolled over any faster?

267
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,130
我爸啥都不知道
My dad didn't know anything.

268
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,770
这只是为了他小孩演的戏
That was just a big act for his kid.

269
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,800
我知道  我只是配合演出
Yeah, I know. I was playing along to --

270
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,900
得了吧
Save it, okay?

271
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,390
绿色别针指的某个地方  有个很失望的老爸
Somewhere, one of these green pins is very disappointed.

272
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,930
玉米片  来点玉米片吧
Nachos. Come get some nachos.

273
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,930
根本没人知道我在后面
No one even knew that I was back there.

274
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,690
当你连我声音都听不到时  就知道有多吵了
You know it's loud when you can't hear my voice!

275
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,600
天啊
My goodness.

276
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,900
照这样  我要打破自己的销售记录了
At this rate, I'll break my own sales record.

277
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,270
你们好  想来点玉米片不
Hola. Do you guys want to try some nachos?

278
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,320
听起来不错啊
That sounds pretty good.

279
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,380
你的贼心也太一目了然了  格伦
Ugh, you are so transparent, Glenn.

280
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,550
快来  快来
Come, come, come.

281
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,030
本店扩张开始卖薯片了
We're expanding to chips.

282
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,080
小卡  你太明显在盯着人家了
Cam, you're staring.

283
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,830
我才没有  你不也是
No, I'm not. So are you.

284
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,510
我得接电话  可能跟雨情有关
Ohh, I should take this. It might be drizzle-related.

285
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,530
海莉  我们是来鼓励你说出c...是什么的
So, Haley, we are here to help you tell us what "C--" is.

286
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,720
你竟然告诉他了
You told him?

287
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,020
你可以放心倾诉  我们是中年同性恋
You can confide in us. We're middle-aged gay men.

288
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,240
不管是什么  我们肯定都听说过
Whatever it is, we have heard of it.

289
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,010
好吧
Fine.

290
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,750
某天晚上  雷纳问我
The other night, Rainer asked me

291
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,520
是否愿意做
if I would be into 

292
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,690
耳烛
candling.

293
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,040
你们知道那是什么吧
You know what that is, right?

294
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,340
-当然  -当然
- Yes! - Yes!

295
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,060
就是做那个...
It's when you do the...

296
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,990
然后  然后...
and then -- and then you --

297
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,810
然后再噗噗
and then you do the -- the boop, boop.

298
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,180
耳烛就是点燃一根中空的蜡烛放入...
Candling is where you light a hollow candle and insert it...

299
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,700
一边耳道内
into one of the ear canals...

300
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,150
以清除耳垢
to remove ear wax.

301
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,320
老天
Ah -- oh, God.

302
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,770
问题是  我不知道自己是否
The thing is, I don't know if I want to be

303
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,250
想和雷纳那么亲密
that intimate with Rainer.

304
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,810
我真的准备好看到他流出的耳屎了吗
Am I really ready to see gunk coming out of his ear?

305
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,670
万一看完觉得他不性感了怎么办
I mean, like, what if he stops being sexy?

306
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,000
就是这样的亲密事
Well, it is intimacy like that

307
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,150
才能让人分出随便谈谈与真爱的不同
that separates casual dating from something more serious.

308
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,740
那你之前说的呢
But what about what you said earlier,

309
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,250
即使你们这么坚定的伴侣也有个人界限
how even committed relationships like yours have boundaries?

310
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,440
说什么  什么界限
Excuse me, what boundaries?

311
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,720
我手机没电了  能借用你们的吗
Hey, my phone died. Can I borrow one of yours?

312
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,650
你跟她说我们有界限吗
You told her we have boundaries?

313
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,390
你跟他们说我让你给我做耳烛吗
You told them I asked you to candle me?

314
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,470
我感觉我们快喝不了茶了
Okay, I feel like this tea's getting away from us.

315
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,220
玉米片  来买玉米片啊
Nachos! Get your nachos here!

316
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,700
走开
Get!

317
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,320
走开
Get!

318
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,700
干扰球  裁判  吹哨啊
Goaltending! Ref, do your job!

319
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,910
我只是个药剂师
I'm a pharmacist.

320
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,840
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

321
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,280
菲尔
Phil.

322
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,720
你似乎有点紧绷
You seem a little tight, man.

323
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,940
德安德鲁·乔丹
Hey, DeAndre Jordan.

324
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,200
没有没有  只是稍稍有点怯场
Uh, no, no, no, just working out the jim-jams.

325
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,690
反正前半重在了解对手
First half's about getting a read.

326
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,450
好吧
Yeah, right.

327
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,410
我都不知道粉丝还能指导呢
I didn't realize that fans were coaching.

328
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,100
而且你帮的是家长队
And you're helping the parents.

329
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,070
教师是我们国家的支柱
Teachers are the backbone of our country.

330
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:07,730
滚吧
Get out of here.

331
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,120
当父母是这世上最艰难的工作
Parenting is the hardest job in the world.

332
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,170
我受够了你自作聪明的样子
I'm so sick of you acting like you know everything.

333
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,410
你去看心理医生真是屁用都没有
Going to therapy did nothing for you.

334
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,100
首先  你别转队了
First of all, stop transferring.

335
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,100
{\an8}曾有过一场违背口头协议的转队闹剧

336
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,220
其次  不如我指导那支队伍
Secondly, how about I coach that team,

337
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,450
你指导这支队伍
you coach this team?

338
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,900
10块海豚币赌你和菲尔输定了
10 Dolphin Dollars you and Phil are going down.

339
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,470
10块连个泡棉海豚都买不起
10? You can't even get a Foam Flipper with that.

340
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,360
何不赌50海豚币
Let's make it 50.

341
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,390
德哥  别这样
D.J., please.

342
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,240
50块现金怎么样
How bout 50 real ones?

343
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,650
好  那就5000美金
Okay. Make it five grand.

344
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,740
一下抬这么高吗
That's the jump?

345
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,450
为我赢下这场
Go win this for me.

346
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,260
好
Okay.

347
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,830
我们是同一队的
We're on the same team!

348
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,600
犯规  有人对我犯规
Foul! Somebody fouled me!

349
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,810
别假摔了
Stop flopping!

350
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,010
菲尔  加油  专注点
Phil, come on, man. Focus!

351
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,540
我们刚赌上了奥运金牌
We just bet our Olympic gold medals.

352
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,190
为什么  没人逼你做到这一步
Why? No one's making you do this!

353
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,600
我不想让你不自在
I hate that I made you uncomfortable.

354
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,830
我只是想让我们对彼此更真实
I-I just wanted us to be real with each other.

355
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,830
我也想这样
I want that, too.

356
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,300
我准备好了  我会给你做耳烛
I think I'm ready. I will candle you.

357
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,160
瞧瞧
Oh, look at that --

358
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,800
两个真实的陌生人打破隔阂
two virtual strangers breaking down walls

359
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,290
而我原先都不知道我们有隔阂
when I didn't even know we had any.

360
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,770
我告诉海莉我们有界限
When I told Haley we had boundaries,

361
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,480
只是指某些事
I just meant that there are certain things

362
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,090
我不会想请你做
I'd rather not ask you to do.

363
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,690
比如呢
Like what?

364
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:04,810
不管我们有何需求
We should be open and honest

365
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,210
都该对彼此坦诚
about whatever our wants and needs are.

366
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,860
既然我们决定坦诚以对
As long as we're being real,

367
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,770
我有件事要向你坦白
there's something you need to know.

368
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,510
我什么事情都愿意...
There is absolutely nothing I --

369
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,370
别打扰我看好戏
Shh! I want to hear this.

370
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,300
把你的手给我
Give me your hands.

371
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,930
好  深呼吸  海莉加油
Okay, deep breath. Come on, Haley.

372
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,650
我的眉毛是画出来的
I draw in my eyebrows.

373
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,870
素颜的我长这样
This is the real me.

374
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,980
他吓跑了吗  他还在不在
Did he leave? Is he still here?

375
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,360
我还在  而你还是一样的美丽动人
I'm still here, and you're still beautiful.

376
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,230
别再逃避我了
Stop running from me.

377
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,210
好吧
Fine.

378
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,130
我也有件事要向你坦白
I have a confession of my own.

379
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,020
看完好戏再说
Two seconds.

380
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,590
我从来没告诉过任何人
I've never told anyone this.

381
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,660
我用胶带给脖子拉皮
I use tape to pull my neck back.

382
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,750
我就知道
I knew it!

383
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,940
好帅好勇敢
Wow. So brave.

384
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,670
我现在感觉好赤裸
I feel so naked right now.

385
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,610
我也是
Me, too.

386
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,320
他们看起来根本没差别  是不
They look exactly the same, right?

387
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,420
有差  他们看起来很幸福
No, what they look is happy

388
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,540
因为他们勇敢地
because they are brave enough

389
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,470
-向对方展现了自己脆弱的一面  -小卡
- to be vulnerable with each other. - Cam --

390
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,850
你知道有多讽刺吗  你不敢叫我
It's just ironic that you won't ask me

391
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,740
帮你做那件神秘的事
to do whatever it is

392
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,250
因为你怕我会评判你
because you're worried I'll judge you,

393
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,350
然而我现在就在评判你  因为你不信任我
but I'm judging you now for not trusting me,

394
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,720
这样真的很伤人
and that hurts.

395
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,450
你说得果然没错
You're right, of course.

396
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,510
这样做真的使我们的关系更亲密了
This is only bringing us closer together.

397
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,720
当然啦  平时是找谁帮你弄来着
Uh-huh! Who'd you say normally does this?

398
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,490
我以前办公室附近的一家店
Uh, this place near my old office.

399
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,930
万不得已时也会找莉莉
Lily in a pinch.

400
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,360
好啦  应该刮干净了
Okay, well, I think that's it.

401
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,690
不行  你还要再刮一遍
Oh, no, you have to go over it one more time.

402
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,060
够了  又不是在给桥上漆
Okay, we're not painting a bridge.

403
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,210
我已经找了两遍了
Okay, I've checked twice.

404
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,730
都没找到最后一个毒衣柜的发票
There's no invoice for this last closet.

405
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,700
肯定有的
Well, there has to be,

406
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,360
一定要找出来  不能被我爸看到
and we've got to find it before my dad does.

407
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,620
会不会是你不小心放碎纸机里碎掉了
Is there any chance you accidentally shredded it?

408
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,680
淡定  就算真的碎掉了  我也能轻易拼回来
Don't worry. If I did, it's an easy restore.

409
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,020
我可是地区拼图大赛60岁以下组别的冠军
I was regional jigsaw champion in the under-60 category.

410
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,780
这诡异的喷嚏
That weird sneeze.

411
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,100
听着就跟新闻上那个得病男的症状一样
You sound like the guy who was sick on the news.

412
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,580
怎么会  那人都快要散架了
No, that guy was falling apart.

413
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,750
你不可能被感染了
You can't be infected.

414
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,030
你并没有跟那块木板接触过
It's not like you've spent any time around that wood.

415
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,460
你又不会去仓库
I mean, you don't hang out in the warehouse.

416
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,200
-我见识过他们有多爱脱你裤子整你  -天啊
- I've seen how much those guys pants you. - Oh, my God.

417
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,660
我妈妈交了个新男友
My mom has a new boyfriend,

418
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,530
她不想让他知道她有孩子
and she doesn't want him to know she has kids,

419
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,060
所以每次他来我家  我就要到会议室过夜
so when he comes over, I sleep in the conference room.

420
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,000
会议室里有个样板衣柜
Which is where the sample closet is,

421
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,350
难怪找不到销售记录
which is why there's no record of it!

422
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,380
天啊
Oh, God!

423
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:06,460
我不常自夸这一点
I don't like to talk about it a lot,

424
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,820
可是我对木材挺有研究
but I have a certain expertise in timber.

425
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,910
即使蒙上眼睛
Even blindfolded,

426
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,980
我也能区分得出加拉帕戈斯柚木和马耳他樱木
I can tell a Galapagos teak from a Maltese cherry.

427
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,130
有一次还用上了这个技能
Came in handy for a cop friend of mine.

428
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,290
帮我的警察朋友逮捕了《雪松兄弟》
Helped him round up the Cedar Boys.

429
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,290
{\an8}《雪松兄弟》是一部澳洲犯罪电影

430
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,310
爸
Dad? Hey!

431
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,130
你进来这里干吗
What are you doing in here, huh?

432
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,920
我在检查这块新木
I'm checking out this new wood.

433
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,110
那才不是新木呢
It's not new wood.

434
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,120
他有什么毛病啊
The hell's the matter with him?

435
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,900
他过敏啦
He's got allergies. Yeah.

436
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,370
我过敏  是过敏
Allergies. Allergies.

437
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,770
爸  你看到我们
Oh, Dad, have you -- have you seen

438
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,580
新买的鱼缸没
this new fish tank we just got?

439
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,570
瞧瞧多漂亮
Check it.

440
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:35,800
你之前说这木材是从哪里进货的
Where did you say we got this wood?

441
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,620
拜托  这破木头有什么好研究的
Please, stop obsessing about the wood.

442
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,520
-这鱼好像饿鬼投胎一样  -就是啊
- Hungry little sucker, huh? - Oh, yeah.

443
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,120
他吃掉这木头真的没问题吗
You sure that's okay for him to eat?

444
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,030
没问题啊
Yeah, it's fine.

445
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,690
那种鱼就是以生命力顽强著名的
Those fish are celebrated for their hardiness.

446
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,620
坚韧不拔
Yeah, hardy.

447
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,230
他们在饶舌歌手圈里很受欢迎
Yeah, they're very popular amongst rappers

448
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,190
因为在按摩浴缸和香槟里都能养活
'cause they do equally well in Jacuzzis and champagne.

449
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,420
乔在哪里
Where's Joe?

450
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,740
-跟玛格丽特在一起  -好吧
- He's with Margaret. - Oh, okay.

451
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,570
我去带他过来  给他看看这个鱼
I'm gonna bring him in here, have him check out this fish.

452
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,490
-好主意啊  -继续说这木头
-That's a good idea. -Getting back to this wood.

453
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,940
爸  这木头没问题  是...
Dad, the wood is fine. It's --

454
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,230
天...
Oh, my --

455
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:04,040
结果发现  这木头不止会让人病
Turns out, the wood doesn't just make people sick.

456
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,650
还会弄死鱼
It also kills fish.

457
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,470
我不敢让我爸知道我买了杀鱼木
Well, I couldn't let Dad know I bought murder wood,

458
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,640
所以我让本下楼去
so I sent Ben to get a replacement fish

459
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,840
从大堂鱼缸弄只一样的鱼来
from the tank in the lobby.

460
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,220
看起来还不错吧
So, those seem right to you? Hmm?

461
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,430
质量结实
They're strudy enough.

462
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,540
转轴平滑
Smooth pivot.

463
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,980
抽屉平高
Even glide.

464
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,950
我本来就对这木头有疑心  它还杀了鱼
I was already suspicious of that wood, but then it kills fish?

465
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,420
克莱尔绝对是买到了受污染木头
Claire obviously bought some of that tainted lumber,

466
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,790
她还想瞒着我
and then she tries hide it?

467
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,870
她心里一定觉得我比美国黄松木还傻[结实]
She must think I'm denser than a Ponderosa maple.

468
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,320
用起来感觉又好又顺手啊
That's a nice, easy ride.

469
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,180
对啊
Yeah.

470
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,210
闺女  你的手为什么湿了
Hey, kiddo, why's your hand wet?

471
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,680
不是啦  是流手汗而已
It's not. It's sweaty.

472
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,110
我今天早上去健身了
I went to the gym this morning.

473
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,140
周五练腿练手
Fridays I do legs and hands.

474
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,200
克莱尔  你让我去弄的水
Claire, here's the water you asked for.

475
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,330
谢谢
Thank you!

476
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,820
我牙都掉了
My tooth just fell out.

477
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,590
我喉咙好像卡了点什么
You know, I got a little something stuck in my throat.

478
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,570
这水让我喝一口
Give me a slug of that water.

479
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,390
你不会想喝这个大堂水的
Oh, no, you don't want this lobby water.

480
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,380
我就喝一小口就行
I just need a sip.

481
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,410
是从大堂饮水机装来的
It's from the fountain,

482
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,300
仓库工人喝的时候嘴都会贴上去
and the warehouse guys put their mouth all over it.

483
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,160
给我就是了
Just give it to me.

484
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,990
不行
I can't.

485
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,200
天啊  你还真喝下去了
Oh, my God, you actually did it.

486
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,520
能感觉到那玩意在你肚子里游吗
Can you feel that thing swimming around in your belly?

487
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,270
你知道里面有鱼的啊
You knew there was a fish in there?

488
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,720
我看见你把原来那只扔掉了
I saw you toss the other one out.

489
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,390
你就这么怕犯错我发现
You're so afraid of getting caught screwing up,

490
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,790
你宁愿吞下一只生物吗
you'd swallow an animal?

491
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,200
感觉你们谈家事需要空间
This sort of seems like a family thing,

492
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,740
而且我的视线开始狭窄了...
and my vision is tunneling, so...

493
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,100
好吧  用了那批木头的产品已经召回
All right, well, we recalled all the bad wood,

494
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,390
但这并不代表我们没犯错
but that doesn't mean that we didn't screw up.

495
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,960
所以你来吧  好好骂我一顿吧
So, go ahead, let me have it.

496
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,100
手撕你闺女
Tear my head off.

497
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,410
说我这次又怎么让你失望了
Tell me how I've disappointed you yet again.

498
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,210
这是怎么回事
And what is happening?

499
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,960
今天一天我都在想办法让乔怕我
All day long I've been trying to get Joe to fear me.

500
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,830
但或许这对孩子并不好
Maybe that's not the best thing for kids.

501
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,700
{\an8}辛辣可口玉米片

502
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:34,970
你来啦
Hi.

503
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,600
我赚了六块海豚币
Well, I made six Dolphin Dollars

504
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,430
还有某个怪人给我20块真钞
plus 20 real ones from some weirdo

505
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,800
让我直接舀一勺起司进他嘴里
who wanted me to ladle cheese straight into his mouth.

506
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,400
好吧  乖儿子谢谢你帮忙
All right, papi, thank you so much,

507
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,300
但我还是需要人帮忙吸引客人来我摊子
but I still need help attracting customers over there.

508
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,060
我可以去菲尔的车上看看
Oh, I can see if Phil has that thing in his car

509
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,620
他那个会这么挥舞的东西
that flails around like this.

510
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,770
卡莱尔吗
Claire?

511
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,130
不是啦  是空气跳舞男
No, his Tube Dude.

512
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,630
有何能为您效劳吗
Can I help you with anything?

513
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,310
我想要用我最后五块海豚币买个零食
I'm just going to buy a snack with my last five Dolphin Dollars.

514
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,480
我不想把这个丢掉
I don't want to throw them away.

515
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,680
证据就是这么留下的
That's how they get you.

516
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,410
玉米片特别好吃
The nachos are amazing.

517
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,580
但绝对别去
But do not get anything

518
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,850
那边那摊子买东西
from the stand that is over there --

519
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,870
那个热狗女士吗
The hot dog lady?

520
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,710
她刚才也这么说了你
She just said the same thing about you.

521
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,140
你们两个让我想起我跟德安德鲁·乔丹
You two remind me of me and DeAndre Jordan.

522
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,590
我们是宿敌  我也不知道为什么
We have a rivalry, and I don't know why.

523
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,370
或许我们在生活中  就讨厌着拿着镜子
Maybe in life we resent people who hold up a mirror

524
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,900
逼我们看到自己最丑恶一面的人
and force us to look at the worst in ourselves.

525
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,620
我听懂你意思了  查尔斯·巴克利
I see what you're saying, Charles Barkley.

526
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,400
我们打篮球的把这叫助攻
And that's what we call an assist.

527
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,460
买过票盖过章了
Hand stamp.

528
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,100
唐娜  我们不能再斗下去了
Donna, we have to stop this fighting.

529
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,800
有位智者曾告诉过我  我们讨厌
A wise man once told me that we resent mirrors

530
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,270
让我们看到自己丑恶一面的镜子
that show us what we don't want to see.

531
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,650
真是可笑
That's ridiculous.

532
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,910
我可喜欢镜子了
I love mirrors.

533
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,450
但重点是我生气是因为
But the point is that I was mad

534
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,740
你让我看清了我真实的一面
because you made me see who I really am,

535
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,620
而我对自己变成的模样感到讶异
and I was shocked to see what I have become.

536
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,660
别说了
Stop talking.

537
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,620
你的话听起来好有人味  我不喜欢这样
You're sounding human, and I don't like that.

538
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,470
我集万千宠爱于一身  本以为这让我有点羞愧
I am soft, privileged lady, and I thought that bothered me.

539
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,590
直到今天  我才意识到压根没有
Until today, I realized that it doesn't.

540
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,460
我才不想辛苦来卖小吃
I don't want to do this.

541
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,080
我喜欢我炊金馔玉的  膏粱锦绣的生活
I love my pretty, pretty life.

542
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,650
而唯一让我感到不安的事
The only thing that makes me feel bad

543
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,820
竟然是我并不为此感到难为情
is that I don't really feel bad about it.

544
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,180
谢谢你愿意敞开心扉和我说这些话
Thank you so much for opening up to me.

545
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,240
我差一点就要对你产生一点感情了
I almost started to feel something for you,

546
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,400
但当你又说了你不觉得羞愧
but then when you said you don't feel guilty,

547
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,650
我的愤怒值又反涨了十倍
my rage returned tenfold.

548
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,180
而我需要这愤怒的感觉  它是我每天起床的动力
And I need that rage. It gets me up in the morning.

549
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,150
如果这能帮到你  从今天起我想吃什么就吃什么
Well, if it helps you, I eat everything I want,

550
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,250
然后大概一年就只锻炼一次
and I work out like once a year.

551
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,060
你这个小妖精
You're horrible.

552
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,810
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

553
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,540
大家听好了  现在追平了  就剩下最后三秒钟
All right, guys -- tie game, three seconds left.

554
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,610
我们要做世上唯一一件他们意想不到的事情
There's only one thing that they're not gonna be expecting.

555
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,980
我们要把球传给菲尔
We're gonna get the ball to Phil.

556
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,710
什么?
What?

557
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,420
他们甚至防都不防你
They're not even guarding you.

558
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,940
我对这招很有信心  我跟巴克利赌上我的车了
I'm so sure of this play, I just bet Barkley my car.

559
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,440
是本田车吗?
Is it a Honda?

560
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,830
是以我头像为车头标志的劳斯莱斯幻影
No, it's a Phantom with my head as the hood ornament.

561
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:47,300
来吧  我们打赢这场比赛
All right, let's win this thing

562
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,110
菲儿  亲爱的  这里!  
-Phil, honey, hi! -Hey.

563
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,990
对不起我们来迟了
I'm sorry we're late,

564
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,540
但好在我们及时赶来看到了比赛的结局
but at least we're here for the end of the game.

565
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,580
在我牛饮金鱼的日子  最需要一场胜利高兴一下
I could really use a win on the day I drank a fish.

566
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,630
是"鲸吸牛饮"
Drank like a fish.

567
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,730
天啊  一堆职篮球员在推特上聊
Wow, a bunch of NBA players are tweeting about this bet

568
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,540
关于巴克利和德安德鲁之间的这场赌局
between Charles Barkley and DeAndre Jordan.

569
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,500
而且他们还在现场直播这场比赛
And they're live-streaming it,

570
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,970
现在大概有六万人在线观看
so like 60,000 people are watching.

571
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,990
人们什么时候开始这么关心篮球了
Since when do people care about basketball?

572
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,430
冷静下来  菲尔  你可以做到的  哥们
Calm down, Phil. You can do this, pal.

573
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,540
你偏偏选这时候第一次相信我吗
You choose now to believe in me for the first time?

574
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,720
上场了 菲尔  你可以做到的
All right, Phil. You got this, man.

575
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,580
罚两球
Two shots!

576
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,930
我走不动了  教练
I can't go, Coach.

577
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,350
我的膝盖好痛
Ow! My ankle.

578
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,800
哎哟哟
Well, well, well...

579
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,730
联赛规则是这样的  如果一个队员
League rules dictate, if a player can't attempt

580
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,540
因为受伤不能进行罚球
a free throw because of injury,

581
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,720
对方球队将可以任意在罚球队选择一个投手
opposing team gets to pick the shooter.

582
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,740
的确  但你一样不是百事通
Right, but you're not a know-it-all.

583
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,510
不要给我这份愤怒的力量
Don't give this anger power.

584
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,490
我选你了  千万"别怯场"啊
I pick you. Don't choke.

585
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,620
你能行的  菲尔  你最棒了  菲尔
You got this, Phil. You got this, Phil.

586
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,100
菲尔·邓菲站到了罚球线前
Phil Dunphy to the free-throw line.

587
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,080
比数平手
Tie score.

588
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,570
现在是决胜时刻了  朋友们
This is for all the marbles, folks.

589
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,260
怎么搞的
Come on!

590
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,650
发生什么了
What happened?

591
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,560
要等一个小时他们才能把电力恢复
It's gonna take an hour to get the power back up,

592
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,030
所以他们就宣布平局结束
so they called the game.

593
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,610
我为菲尔感到好难过
I just feel so bad for Phil.

594
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,930
他这个重在参与  成败在天型的乐天派
You know him as this happy-go-lucky guy,

595
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,040
其实在心里谴责自己一整年了
but he has been beating himself up over this for a year.

596
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,670
而他就差一点就可以证明自己了
And he was so close!

597
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,340
不知道最后到底会不会进这事
It's gonna haunt him never knowing

598
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,160
将会在他心里不断萦绕
if he would have made that shot.

599
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,530
胜败就此一举
Game's on the line.

600
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,840
大家都在看着你
Everybody's watching.

601
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,860
现在是决胜时刻了  朋友们
This one's for all the marbles, folks.

602
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,630
这个小兔崽子居然真进了
Son of a bitch made it.

603
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,860
你知道  我很高兴我们能再举办一次茶话会
You know, I'm glad we're doing this again.

604
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,120
是啊  我感觉我们给第一次施加太大压力了
Yeah, I think we just put too much pressure on it the first time.

605
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,340
其实人类不是唯一一个
You know, humans aren't the only ones

606
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,620
会被压力带来负面影响的种族
who respond badly to pressure.

607
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,720
不知道我没有跟你提过无蛋日
Did I ever tell you about the day without eggs?

608
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,420
那发生在煎蛋节刚刚开始的时候
It was at the start of the Omelet Days Festival.

609
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,600
太阳一出来  我就带上我的篮子
Up with the sun, I grab my basket,

610
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,510
走进了鸡棚  34只母鸡  连一个蛋都没有
into the henhouse I go -- 34 hens, nary an egg.

611
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,850
我知道  我知道
I know, I know.

612
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:16,540
我爷爷说这是自珍珠港后他所见过
My grandpa said it was the worst case of avian anxiety

613
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,110
最严重的一次禽类焦虑症了
he's seen since Pearl Harbor.

614
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,210
所以后来他们才要把收音机从鸡棚里收走...
That's when they had to take the radio out of the coop.
