19
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,170
My name is Barry Allen.

20
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,350
And I am the fastest man alive.

21
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,100
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

22
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,580
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

23
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,400
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

24
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,670
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,

25
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,120
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

26
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,350
and I saw him murder the woman that I love.

27
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,110
But I won't let that happen.

28
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,110
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future,

29
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,810
and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.

30
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,050
I am The Flash.

31
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,960
Previously on "The Flash"...

32
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,220
The Philosopher's Stone has been the key to everything.

33
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,440
So we destroy the Stone, and Savitar is gone for good.

34
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,890
There's only one thing we can do with it.

35
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,220
Throw it into the Speed Force.

36
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,440
I have to do what I can to help.

37
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,940
I'm the guy who avoided his dying mother for weeks.

38
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,510
I have a whole lot to make up for.

39
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,390
I like you, Julian,

40
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,880
but I'm also afraid of my powers

41
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,280
and what they could do to anyone who gets close to me.

42
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,960
I didn't ask for these powers,

43
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,400
just like you didn't ask to be used by Savitar.

44
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,410
I think we should be terrified together.

45
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,560
Sure. Together it is.

46
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,790
It's crazy how fast I've gotten in such a short time.

47
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,140
And I'm gonna need you to get a lot faster.

48
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,820
I'm not gonna save Iris from Savitar. You are.

49
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,630
Iris West, will you marry me?

53
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,400
And Wally just beat his personal best.

54
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,940
Oh, Barry's putting him through the wringer today.

55
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,920
Excuse--Barry? Excuse me?

56
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,530
Yeah, I suppose it could be Barry,

57
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,260
or it could be his genius coach, whose sole purpose

58
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,720
on this Earth is milking epic greatness

59
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,090
from those around him.

60
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,020
Thank you very much.

61
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,900
- It could also be Jesse. - What?

62
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,240
Come on, Wally doesn't want to get beat by his girlfriend.

63
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,870
Also, please, just refrain from

64
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,660
using "milk" as a verb from now on, please.

65
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,330
I'm getting kind of dizzy.

66
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,640
You're supposed to get dizzy, Wallace!

67
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,070
You're supposed to get exhausted on this route.

68
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,270
It's supposed to simulate

69
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,720
the stress that you're gonna feel

70
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,710
when you finally confront Savitar,

71
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,460
so my suggestion to you is, suck it up, buttercup!

72
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,360
Milking epic greatness.

73
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,420
Yeah, no kidding.

74
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,290
Why don't you take it down a little, Tiger Mom?

75
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,530
Barry and Jesse are at the final mark.

76
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,530
You ready?

77
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,100
Wally's at the home stretch.

78
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,610
Come on...

79
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,090
Guys?

80
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,480
0.21 seconds.

81
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,830
0.21
0.21.

82
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,470
Just fast enough to save Iris from Savitar.

83
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,160
You did it.

84
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,350
- You did it. - We did it.

85
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,110
You did it!

86
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,020
You did it.

87
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,860
You okay?

88
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,010
Yeah, yeah.

89
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,690
I'm just... happy.

90
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,350
We all are, Wally. We all are.

93
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,990
Julian.

94
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,360
- Hi. How are you? It... - Caitlin, how are you?

95
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,290
You've come straight from the airport?

96
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,650
Yes, yes...

97
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,300
Barry said he had something to tell me.

98
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,180
Is he here?

99
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,750
He'll be here any minute, I'm sure.

100
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,590
- Shall we? Yeah? - Yes, we shall.

101
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,500
We shall.

102
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:37,190
- Look who I found. - Hey, guys.

103
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,350
- How are we doing? - Julian.

104
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,580
It's good to see you. Good to see you all.

105
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,110
Jesse, I thought you were heading back to Earth-2.

106
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,380
I actually decided to stick around for a little while.

107
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,690
Hey, does anybody know what's going on?

108
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,220
I mean, I got a mountain of paperwork back at the office.

109
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,400
No, not the foggiest. I was gonna ask you.

110
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,730
Welcome home, James.

111
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,180
Can I brew you a proper cup of tea?

112
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,860
And a robust pick-me-up for you, mate.

113
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,150
No need. We hit Jitters on the way.

114
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,390
- Got everybody something. - You guys are...

115
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,170
I thought you were on deadline.

116
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,550
I am.

117
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,520
You ready?

118
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,560
- For you. - Here.

119
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,020
Okay. What is going on with you two?

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,290
Uh, do you want to?

121
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,280
This is all you.

122
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,230
Okay, here goes.

123
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,650
No!

124
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,260
Congratulations! That's so exciting!

125
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,890
Thank you. Thanks.

126
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,650
Hey, thanks, man.

127
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,470
You did it. This is... This is fantastic.

128
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,000
Well done, Joe. Congratulations.

129
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,910
Dad, say something, please.

130
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,760
My baby girl.

131
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,400
You have grown into a beautiful woman.

132
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,110
You're marrying the best man I know.

133
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,750
Thanks.

134
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,780
You two bring me nothing but joy.

135
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,790
- I'm so happy for you. - Okay.

136
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,190
This cuteness right here, I cannot...

137
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,260
Congrats.

138
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,520
- Thank you. - Yeah.

139
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,100
And speaking of, um,

140
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,390
best man...

141
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,360
I'll do it. Of course.

142
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,520
When Barry and I first met...

143
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,160
- H.R. - You mean him.

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,230
Okay, good.

145
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,070
I...

146
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,880
I'd be honored. Really.

147
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,460
I mean, as long as I can get that plus-one.

148
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,160
'Cause, you know, me and Gypsy,

149
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,910
we about to tear up the dance floor for you guys.

150
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,820
Barry.

151
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,040
Can I talk to you for a second?

152
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,970
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,600
Now, I wanted to be sure that you heard what I said in there.

154
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,100
I couldn't be happier.

155
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,540
Okay, right.

156
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,830
So...

157
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,480
Why didn't you ask my permission?

158
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,360
I mean, I told you the story

159
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,770
of me asking Francine's dad's permission,

160
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,860
like, a hundred times.

161
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,440
At least, yeah. And that's a great story.

162
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,450
Eh, but you missed the point?

163
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,770
I... yeah, I...

164
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,360
I don't... It was spontaneous.

165
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,970
I knew you'd say yes, and I wanted to surprise you.

166
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,320
There's a three-alarm fire in the Raab building.

167
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,000
Fire department is evacuating it now.

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,790
Jesse is a little preoccupied with the ring,

169
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,170
- so it's just you and me. - Okay.

170
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,540
- What you two waiting for? Go. - Yeah.

171
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,400
Wallace...

172
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,580
Wallace West.

173
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,120
Wally...

174
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,230
What the hell?

175
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,470
Wally.

176
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,540
What's happening? What's wrong?

177
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,070
Where'd he go?

178
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,510
Who?

179
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,730
Where is he?

180
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,190
Who? Where is who?

181
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,710
Savitar.

182
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,870
I feel fine.

183
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,290
So now Savitar's mind-punking you...

184
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,630
Oh, boy.

185
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,770
This never stops never stopping.

186
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,450
How long has this been going on, Wally?

187
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,340
- Like a week. - A week.

188
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,260
Wally, why didn't you say anything before?

189
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,460
Because I didn't know what this was.

190
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,240
I thought that this was just maybe in my head.

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,780
You know, I wasn't looking at it like I was keeping it to myself.

192
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,190
That's exactly what you did, though, Wally.

193
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,200
You did keep it to yourself,

194
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,940
and with Savitar, that's not something we can do.

195
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,040
This is Iris' life we're talking about.

196
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,010
- Yes, I know that. - Do you, though, Wally?

197
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,700
- Yes. - Uh, okay.

198
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,370
Until now, it was-- you only saw him, right?

199
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,460
Yeah, this was the first time it was physical.

200
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,020
What-- he wasn't there!

201
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,190
Okay? You weren't fighting him.

202
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,590
He was messing with your head.

203
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,720
It was all in your mind.

204
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,930
I've been there. Done that.

205
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,990
It's miserable.

206
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,240
Okay, why don't I run a brain scan on Wally,

207
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,580
see if he was similarly affected

208
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,950
to when Julian was possessed?

209
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,320
Yeah, that's fine. Why don't we do that?

210
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,180
Wally shouldn't be in here anyway.

211
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,990
- What? - Barry, he knows he messed up.

212
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,920
That's not what this is about, okay? Look, it's...

213
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,640
If Savitar's using Wally the same way he used Julian,

214
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,660
how do we know he's not spying on us through Wally right now?

215
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,470
Wally, we don't know how this works.

216
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,910
How do we know he can't see and hear everything we're doing?

217
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,250
Look, you're out.

218
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,670
- I'm out? - I'm sorry, Wally.

219
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,750
Yeah, you don't sound real sorry.

220
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,580
All right, fellows, let's take a quick ten.

221
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,580
We're all still the "Four Amigos" here, right?

222
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,490
What?

223
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,890
You don't have that movie on this Earth?

224
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,980
I'll go talk to him.

225
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,260
Yeah, talk some sense into him.

226
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,150
All right. So what now?

227
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,040
Well, we know from the future

228
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,680
that Savitar gets out of wherever he is,

229
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,440
but for now, he's still trapped, so...

230
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,040
I need to talk to him again.

231
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,640
No, I knew you were thinking this.

232
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,700
All right? And I won't do it.

233
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,250
I'm not gonna be your personal walkie-talkie to him.

234
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,060
Guys, we can't. We don't have the Stone.

235
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,690
Actually, we can.

236
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,790
We still have Savitar's spatial frequency

237
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,510
from when we plugged in Linda Blair here,

238
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,740
so I think we could work without the Stone.

239
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,800
Julian, I'm sorry, man. We don't really have a choice.

240
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,870
Oh, we do have a choice. I have a choice.

241
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,520
And I choose to decline.

242
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,220
I'm sorry.

243
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,760
- We're starting to fray. - Well, we can't. All right?

244
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,230
Everybody just needs to trust me.

245
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,350
I know what I'm doing.

246
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,310
Come to talk me into it, then?

247
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,630
No.

248
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,660
Barry's lost his bloody mind if he thinks

249
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,300
I'm gonna volunteer to be... abused again.

250
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,240
He's just trying to protect Iris.

251
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,290
We all are.

252
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,140
But...not like that.

253
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,390
Is the reason you don't want to do this because...

254
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,740
you don't want me to see it?

255
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,550
I just think...

256
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,120
Hearing his voice coming out of me, I...

257
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,170
It just makes it impossible for you to see me as a normal--

258
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,500
I've had somebody else's voice coming out of my mouth,

259
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,040
and you were still able to see the real me.

260
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,000
How about trusting that I can do the same thing?

261
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,800
Sorry.

262
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,460
I just wanted to do that,

263
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,440
in case you changed your mind later.

264
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,480
Quite all right.

265
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,100
Julian, you're gonna be okay.

266
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,370
You know the drill.

267
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,890
Just let your mind go blank.

268
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,860
We'll take care of the rest. Okay?

269
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,820
Just let Savitar back in the driver's seat once more.

270
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,360
Brilliant. Thank you.

271
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,830
Let's just get this over with, yeah?

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,690
Bow before my greatness.

273
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,390
Be in awe, as you are in the presence of the Almighty.

274
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,320
Enough with the... religious nonsense.

275
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,130
You were just a man. Like me.

276
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,860
I'm nothing like you, Barry.

277
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,890
You're cruel, you're selfish.

278
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,210
From my perspective, you're the big bad.

279
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:21,840
Stupid.

280
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,520
Still here, pretender?

281
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,650
Still trying to find your place?

282
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,200
I found my place.

283
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,100
It's standing here with these people,

284
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,300
against you.

285
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,810
You know, the sad thing is that you live.

286
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,180
You survived my wrath.

287
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,380
The coward. Irony.

288
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,390
Where are you?

289
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,730
You said that I trapped you in the future, where?

290
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,530
The only place that you could think of.

291
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,280
The only place that could hold me.

292
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,520
How long have you been imprisoned?

293
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,900
Long enough to lose my mind several times over.

294
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,520
It's only my will that keeps me on this side of sanity.

295
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,870
You know, it's funny, when I think of sanity,

296
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,860
I don't necessarily think of Savitar.

297
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,860
Well, that's because you're small, Cisco.

298
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,110
You've always been small.

299
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,080
Reverb told you that you could have been a god.

300
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,380
But instead, you'd rather work as...tech support.

301
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,260
You want to tell me why we're enemies?

302
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,080
Because we had to be.

303
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,290
Only one of us could live.

304
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,650
You thought that Thawne and Zoom

305
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,460
were your biggest foes, but...

306
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,390
But it's me.

307
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,070
It's always been me, Barry.

308
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,940
Man, what did we ever do to you?

309
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,740
You took everything from me!

310
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,030
I never asked for any of this, Joe.

311
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:42,200
I am only this way because of you.

312
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,050
All of you!

313
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,460
When do we meet?

314
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,710
Not long now.

315
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,160
You're there when I become who I am.

316
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,390
You're saying I caused you to get your speed?

317
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,540
- I created you? - Oh, no.

318
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,550
I created myself, Barry.

319
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,940
Only I can bring out my greatness.

320
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,920
Your greatness?

321
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,910
Well, you're still trapped,

322
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,060
wherever you are,

323
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,030
and I don't know how you're gonna escape.

324
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,880
I mean, we got rid of the Philosopher's Stone.

325
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,690
Did we?

326
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,710
I am closer to my freedom than I have ever been.

327
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,810
Every step, every move that you make,

328
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,060
it only brings me nearer to it.

329
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,550
I only need one more thing.

330
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,570
Man, do you love to hear yourself talk.

331
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,160
Iris, trying to show that you're not afraid?

332
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,240
But I know you are.

333
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,930
I'm sorry that you have to die.

334
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,490
But it's you or me.

335
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,730
And despite your feeble efforts to change the future,

336
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,070
you can't,

337
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,390
because I am the future, Flash.

338
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,570
Barry, you've had to suffer worse than anyone.

339
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,820
You've endured pain your whole life.

340
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,390
Your mother,

341
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,620
your father...

342
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,440
Trust me,

343
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,790
you'll never get over this.

344
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,260
Well...

345
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,860
Well?

346
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,820
Good chat, was it?

347
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,340
I-I don't know if I can take another one of those s¨¦ances.

348
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,450
Anyone else with me?

349
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,240
I almost filled my drawers.

350
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,660
Okay, so other than Savitar taking

351
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,680
scaring-the-bejeezus-out-of-us to a whole new level,

352
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,590
did we actually learn anything?

353
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,260
- Please say yes. - Maybe.

354
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,760
When I mentioned the Stone, he questioned whether or not

355
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,970
we'd really gotten rid of it.

356
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,110
We did. We threw it into the Speed Force.

357
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,950
That's like throwing it into outer space.

358
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,670
Uh, maybe we didn't.

359
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,280
I mean, maybe there's more to it.

360
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,920
A second Stone?

361
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,530
Or maybe the Stone that we had was part of a larger piece.

362
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,580
How about the Acolytes?

363
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,350
Maybe they know something we don't.

364
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,260
- Hey, what about that one guy? - Craig?

365
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,420
Yes, the Acolyte that you dropped in on

366
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,700
when you went all cold?

367
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,020
His car's GPS has him located

368
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,960
somewhere near... Mount Buccelato.

369
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,660
Buccelato, that's miles away.

370
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,320
What--what would he be doing over there?

371
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,510
There's one way to find out.

372
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,210
Talk to us. What do you see?

373
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,920
Some serious "Temple of Doom" Stuff.

374
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,250
They have a box.

375
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,530
God of Speed, soon your enemies will fall

376
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,240
and you will rise once more on Earth.

377
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,540
It looks just like the last one that held the Stone.

378
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,660
You were right, Barr.

379
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,790
What are you gonna do?

380
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,320
I'm gonna go see what's in it.

381
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,770
What exactly were you guys doing up here?

382
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,540
Worshipping His Greatness.

383
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,510
Let's see how far he gets without this.

384
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,100
He's ten steps ahead of you.

385
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,720
There's no stopping Savitar.

386
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,290
If I were you...

387
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,830
I'd move up the wedding.

388
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,320
So far...not so good.

389
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,860
Can't get any readings off of it.

390
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,490
It's the same as the last time.

391
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,620
Are we sure this isn't the same box?

392
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,240
Well, it can't be.

393
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,280
I mean, I threw the other one into the Speed Force.

394
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,810
Yeah, but you said the explosion

395
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,830
sent you to the future.

396
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,290
What if it did something to the box too, you know?

397
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,640
I hate to say it, Barry, but,

398
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,130
after all my years of research,

399
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,760
I've never heard or come across another box or Stone;

400
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,170
I think this is it.

401
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,670
If that's true, we need to consider the possibility

402
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,470
that Savitar has that Stone.

403
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,270
I'm gonna check for radioactive isotopes

404
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,980
or gravimetric force residue,

405
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,360
'cause if it's the same as the last time--

406
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,640
We're in big trouble.

407
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,530
You can go faster than that, Wally. Run!

408
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,650
And... Time!

409
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,430
Yeah. Yeah. That was, uh...

410
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,400
Good.

411
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,100
We need to go again.

412
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,420
But I don't understand. I was fast enough this morning.

413
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,600
Now all of a sudden, I'm too slow?

414
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,390
You're in your head. You gotta get out of your head, man.

415
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,090
You gotta just run, you gotta push everything else to the side.

416
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,220
- Yeah, I'm trying, H.R. I can't do it! - Okay.

417
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,230
- All right? - Okay.

418
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,810
All right. Why not?

419
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,770
I don't know.

420
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,770
I do.

421
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,970
You're afraid.

422
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,860
Which is... I totally understand.

423
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,590
I mean, if I were in your shoes, I'd be terrified.

424
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:22,130
But you can't run from a place of fear, all right?

425
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,170
Nobody can do anything effectively coming from a place of fear.

426
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,470
Trust me, I know.

427
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,390
Savitar can get inside my head.

428
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,520
What am I supposed to do if he does that at the wrong time?

429
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,460
It sure would be a lot easier if I just

430
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,680
knew exactly how that night went.

431
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,800
Would it ever.

432
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,880
Are you picking up what I'm putting down?

433
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,800
Uh-huh.

434
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,510
Let's go.

435
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,510
No way. I'm not gonna vibe you there

436
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,100
for you to watch your sister die.

437
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,660
Okay. Just-just-just--

438
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,390
Th-this is to help Wallace.

439
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,990
To help him see what happens

440
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,910
so he knows what to do in the moment.

441
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,840
Come on, Cisco, please.

442
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,860
If Savitar's coming back

443
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,890
and I'm the only one that can save Iris,

444
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,180
I have to do everything I can to make sure that happens.

445
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,050
And you're sure you want to do that?

446
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,950
Because this is not something you can unsee, Wally.

447
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:11,080
If this is gonna help me save my sister, yeah.

448
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,380
I have to see it.

449
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,670
Please.

450
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,690
Okay, if you have to see it...

451
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,400
Come on down. Be my guest.

452
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,060
H.R., you know how to work this, right?

453
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,650
I know how to work this, yeah.

454
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,950
Anything goes wrong, you get Caitlin down here stat.

455
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,500
I know what I'm doing. I was here the last time.

456
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,850
I saw what you did. All I got to do is do this.

457
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,890
- The other one. - It's the other button.

458
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,560
Bit of a lighter touch next time, please, H.R.!

459
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,670
- Copy. Lighter touch. - This way.

460
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,690
Don't!

461
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,220
This is it.

462
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,470
- Okay. - So that's the distance I need to cover.

463
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,010
Don't do this!

464
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,510
Now, finally, I am free of you!

465
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,440
Barry, I love you.

466
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,280
No, don't say that, all right? You're gonna be all right.

467
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,190
Hey, I'm begging you, I'm begging you!

468
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm beg...

469
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,050
Barry?

470
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,390
You lose, Barry.

471
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,660
No!

472
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,940
No!

473
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,500
Iris?

474
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,340
Iris, Iris.

475
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,550
Look.

476
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,660
Come on.

477
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,310
What--what'd you see?

478
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,710
Was it good? Did that--did that help?

479
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,110
- Yeah. - Yeah?

480
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,440
It helped a lot.

481
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,110
Wally...

482
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,570
Why does nobody ever listen to me?

483
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,210
You're so full of it.

484
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,960
- What? - Railing at me

485
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,090
for not telling everyone about Savitar?

486
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,260
What about what you're not telling everyone, Barry?

487
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,870
What are you--

488
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,820
Cisco vibed me into the future.

489
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,940
I saw what happened.

490
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,520
Tell my sister why you asked her to marry you.

491
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,190
Go on, tell her the real reason, Barry.

492
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,390
What is he talking about?

493
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,310
Barry.

494
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,880
The night that Savitar kills you,

495
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,600
you didn't have a ring on your finger.

496
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,500
We weren't engaged yet.

497
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,650
So you thought that if we were...

498
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,560
That it might change the future.

499
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,300
Iris...

500
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,300
Iris, wait.

501
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,740
Iris, hey. Come on.

502
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,620
I love you, okay? I love you more than anything.

503
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,820
That part has never changed. It never will.

504
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,030
Barry, we moved in together after some rash decision

505
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,240
that you made at Christmas,

506
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,070
and then a couple weeks later, you proposed.

507
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,750
You didn't even ask for my dad's permission.

508
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,610
I know. I don't know-- I guess I got caught--

509
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,450
I got caught up in the moment. I...

510
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,840
That is exactly what I am afraid of.

511
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,930
Iris, please, come on--

512
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,350
Barry, I just-- I need time to think.

513
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,660
You okay?

514
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,890
I'm worried.

515
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,520
Yeah, I understand.

516
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,070
I keep coming back to the thought that...

517
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,720
I could be the cause of all this.

518
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,480
What do you mean?

519
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,160
Savitar's prophecy.

520
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,430
"One will betray you""

521
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,220
You may well have invited Judas into the group, Caitlin.

522
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,690
It's not you.

523
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,300
It's impossible to tell

524
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,750
Savitar could be controlling me,and

525
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,300
none of us would know about it.

526
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,620
None of us, not even me.

527
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,690
But this time, we know who it is.

528
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,510
How?

529
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,620
Because...

530
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,650
I'm the one who betrayed everyone.

531
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,050
How long have you had this?

532
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,030
Ever since you threw the box into the Speed Force.

533
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,380
It's such a small piece.

534
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,220
I didn't think it would really matter.

535
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,040
Why would you even risk it?

536
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:44,320
Because...

537
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,580
I thought I could use it to get rid of my powers.

538
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,970
And...can you?

539
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,910
I don't know. I haven't been able to figure out how to use it yet.

540
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,640
Okay, well, look, gang, I think we can all agree

541
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,760
that this is a simple case of the other side--

542
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,800
Killer Frost side of Caitlin

543
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,640
clouding her better judgment, so...

544
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,740
No, H.R. This wasn't her.

545
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,850
It was me. I'm really sorry, guys.

546
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,550
Right now, we just need to figure out where Savitar is.

547
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,410
Yes, I think that's a fantastic plan.

548
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,930
How are we gonna do that?

549
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,020
- No. - One more time.

550
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,800
- No. - No, no.

551
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,360
You want to summon Savitar again?

552
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,130
I am not a human Ouija board, Barry.

553
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,820
- You can't just keep-- - It's the last time, all right?

554
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,790
And only long enough to see

555
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,400
if maybe we can track his location.

556
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,080
- Is that possible? - No. No.

557
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,970
Julian, we gotta end this, for everybody's sake.

558
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,450
I'll see you downstairs.

559
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,000
Okay, well, you guys can count me out, all right?

560
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,880
'Cause I didn't bring an endless supply of boxers to this planet.

561
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:51,910
Julian, please.

562
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,820
I should have told you.

563
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,140
I can't believe that you would keep part of that Stone.

564
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,470
Do you not remember what Savitar had me do with that?

565
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,610
Yes, I do.

566
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,370
But you're not concerned, are you?

567
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:08,130
You just want your own personal meta-human specialist

568
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,560
to try and find you a cure.

569
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Julian, I don't want these powers.

570
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,470
I can't spend the rest of my life wondering

571
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,490
if or when I'm gonna lose this battle

572
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,290
and become Killer Frost.

573
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:23,190
I thought you more than anyone would understand that.

574
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,970
You know-- you know what I understand?

575
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,880
I understand the real reason that you invited me on this team.

576
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,530
That's not the only reason.

577
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,920
Yeah, I wish I could believe that.

578
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,700
Dad.

579
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,510
I heard what happened.

580
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,600
Thought you might need a pick-me-up.

581
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,880
Worked like a charm when you were a kid.

582
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,550
Smaller problems.

583
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,470
Yeah.

584
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,380
So...

585
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,500
You wanna talk about it?

586
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,970
I don't know what I want, Dad.

587
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,260
Iris...

588
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,230
Whatever you may be feeling right now about Barry,

589
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,620
that man does love you.

590
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:22,350
That--that kind of love is rare.

591
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,330
Dad, I wish it were that simple.

592
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,250
Simple.

593
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,320
Look, only you know

594
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,730
what's good for you.

595
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,530
But with the kind of lives

596
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:37,180
that you two have,

597
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,940
that love between the two of you,

598
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,070
that is the one thing

599
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,420
that should stay simple.

600
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,140
Baby girl.

601
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,760
We'll be here if you need anything.

602
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,230
Okay.

603
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,280
Back to worship me once again?

604
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,020
We just wanted to let you know that we're gonna defeat you.

605
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,390
Unlikely.

606
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,450
You told us that you're trapped,

607
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,360
imprisoned for all eternity.

608
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,390
You're never getting out

609
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,230
of wherever my future self locked you up.

610
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,000
You'll never know freedom again.

612
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,480
All will be revealed soon, Flash.

613
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,630
You will face my wrath.

614
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,430
You will beg for mercy,

615
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:27,660
and you will get none.

616
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,490
- Did it work? - Did it work?

617
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,970
Yeah. We got a hit.

618
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,230
It's just that that hit is all of Central City.

619
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,860
That's not a hit. The whole city?

620
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,510
- Yeah. - God. Well...

621
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,010
Can we get a little more specific?

622
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,970
Pinpoint a location at least-- uh, something?

623
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,670
I think maybe we can get a little bit more precise,

624
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,480
but I'm gonna have to give it the old meta-human try.

625
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,550
Okay.

626
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,450
It's Iris. All right.

627
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,120
I'll be right back, but...

628
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,540
Just let me know if you get anything, all right?

629
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
All right

630
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,240
You going somewhere?

631
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,460
Yeah, I just wanna get back to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.

632
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,470
Seeing as how you exploded on Barry in front of everyone,

633
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,990
might want to wait on it.

634
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,780
Well, the truth had to come out, so...

635
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,300
Yeah, it did.

636
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,310
Just maybe not that way.

637
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,720
I mean, we all have to help each other,

638
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,800
not point fingers.

639
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,830
You're right. I...

640
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,300
I'll make it up to them. It's just,

641
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,830
this whole thing is messing with my head.

642
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,690
- Don't let it. - You don't get it, Jesse.

643
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,660
When you got your powers,

644
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,120
you were walking down the street.

645
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,910
Me? I touched the Philosopher's Stone,

646
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,860
I got trapped in some cocoon, and...

647
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,200
I just feel, because of all of that, I...

648
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,300
There's something wrong with me.

649
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,090
I feel like Savitar has some kind of...hold on me.

650
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,380
Look, I know.

651
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,210
Okay? But you're strong, Wally.

652
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,650
You can fight this.

653
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,260
You know, all I ever wanted was to have powers.

654
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,400
To do some good.

655
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,170
But now, now I'm-- I'm the one responsible

656
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,370
for saving Iris' life.

657
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,640
I don't know if I'm gonna be fast enough to save her, so--

658
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,000
Okay, Wally. You're not alone.

659
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,190
Okay.

660
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,020
She's right, Wally.

661
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,020
You're not alone.

662
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,960
Mom.

663
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,120
You're never alone, Wally.

664
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,200
- I've missed you so much. - I missed you too.

665
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,270
Wally?

666
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,520
I'm so proud of you.

667
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,310
Of what you're trying to become.

668
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,450
That's all I want.

669
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,580
I just want you to be proud of me.

670
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,130
Wally, you're really freaking me out.

671
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,210
I am, son. I'm so very, very proud.

672
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,870
But you have to stop.

673
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,890
What? Why?

674
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,070
You're working so hard.

675
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,690
You don't see how dangerous it is.

676
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,450
Son, you're not fast enough.

677
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,800
You never will be.

678
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,900
But I can't--I can't stop. I have to save Iris.

679
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,970
- I have to. - Wally.

680
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,200
You're in my head again.

681
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,430
You were always so smart.

682
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,110
Weren't you, Wallace?

683
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,420
But not smart enough.

684
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,870
I have what I need to escape my hell, Wallace.

685
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,740
No, not everything.

686
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,890
We still have a piece of that Stone.

687
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,540
Not for long.

688
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,870
And once I have it, you and everyone you love

689
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,410
will perish.

690
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,670
Wally?

691
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,770
I have to go. I can't let him get out.

692
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,390
- What are you talking about? - Savitar.

693
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,720
You need to tell Barry, okay?

694
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,880
No. I can do this by myself.

695
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,510
Jesse, please, just wait here.

696
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:45,920
I got your message.

697
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,170
Yeah. Come, sit down.

698
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,570
Iris,

699
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,120
I know you're mad, but--

700
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,700
No, Barry, that's not it.

701
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,870
I just want you to listen. Okay?

702
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,810
I need you to let me say what I need to say.

703
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,150
Okay.

704
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,050
I'm not angry... at you.

705
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,420
I understand that you...

706
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,400
You want to keep me safe,

707
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,890
and us getting engaged could change the future.

708
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,840
I-- I get all of that.

709
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,310
Barry, when you proposed to me...

710
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,330
I said yes because...

711
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,130
I love you more than anything.

712
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,490
And I want to be your wife.

713
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,660
But I thought that you were asking me purely out of love,

714
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,030
not fear.

715
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,070
And, Barry, whether you realize it or not,

716
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:51,400
now there's always gonna be a part of us that's tainted.

717
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,630
Iris, I'm trying to save your life.

718
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,760
I know, and that's the problem.

719
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,320
I want to be your wife, Barry.

720
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,850
I don't want to be...

721
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,070
someone that you're trying to save

722
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,740
for the rest of eternity.

723
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,600
Eternity.

724
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,000
- Can't see anything. - Give me those.

725
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,950
- Are those things even working? - Yep.

726
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,670
- Stop it! - I just wanna see

727
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:29,450
- if they're working. - What are you doing?

728
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,630
- What do you see? - I'm seeing these white...

729
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,110
- flashes, it's like... - Flashes?

730
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,910
Yeah, it's like Savitar speeding through, like, a storm.

731
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,320
No, it's not a storm.

732
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,260
It's the Speed Force.

733
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,410
He's in the Speed Force.

734
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,560
That's why only speedsters were able to see him.

735
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,330
Why is Savitar hiding in the Speed Force?

736
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,450
He's not hiding.

737
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,960
That's where the future you trapped him.

738
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,080
That's right.

739
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,420
And that's why Savitar only appears

740
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,380
for a few moments at a time, because the Speed Force

741
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,320
just sucks him back in. That makes sense.

742
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,100
But we threw the Philosopher's Stone

743
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,830
into the Speed Force.

744
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,040
And we gave him the very thing he needed to escape.

745
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,490
Except, he said he still needed one thing.

746
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,490
I don't think he can come out

747
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,260
because he doesn't have the whole Stone.

748
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,170
Guys...

749
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,010
- Wally went after Savitar. - What?

750
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,630
He started hallucinating.

751
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,360
He thought he was talking to his mom.

752
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,740
No, that's--that's not her. That's Savitar.

753
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,250
- Where'd he go? - I don't know.

754
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,830
Okay. He was freaking out. He said that

755
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,800
he needed to stop Savitar from getting out,

756
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:30,220
and he sped off.

757
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:33,060
The Stone.

758
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,700
It's gone?

759
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,600
- It's gone. - Barry, we gotta find Wally.

760
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,580
Yeah. If Savitar gets ahold of the Stone, then--

761
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,910
He'll escape for sure.

762
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,070
I can't find him. He turned off the suit's telemetry.

763
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,190
Oh, come on!

764
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,770
Poor Wallace.

765
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,810
Can't even open a portal.

766
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:02,630
You can't get rid of that Stone, Wallace.

767
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,060
Like you can't get rid of me.

768
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,770
Shut up, shut up.

769
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,990
You know it's true.

770
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,160
You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force

771
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,530
- by yourself. - Shut up!

772
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,910
I'm going to get out of here, Wallace.

773
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,240
And then I'm gonna come for you...

774
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,860
and Barry and your sister,

775
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,440
and I'll kill everyone you love.

776
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,780
No, you're not real!

777
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:30,490
You're just in my head, just...

778
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,890
Oh, I'm real,

779
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,190
and I know the limits of your speed.

780
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,340
After all, I'm the one who gave it to you.

781
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,090
And that...

782
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,620
giving me speed...

783
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:46,150
that was your biggest mistake.

784
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,290
- There's a massive power surge. - Where?

785
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,620
The old Kob Factory.

786
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,000
Pulling up security footage.

787
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,160
Oh, my God.

788
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,500
Wally.

789
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,230
No! Help me, Barry!

790
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,070
I am free!

791
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,130
Ground. Air...

792
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,720
I can feel again. I can breathe again.

793
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,810
I've beaten you, finally.

794
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,550
Where's Wally?

795
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,480
What just happened to him?

796
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,920
Like the Greek myth of Atlas,

797
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,010
who could not put down the sky until someone took his place,

798
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,970
Wally has taken my place in the Speed Force.

799
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,600
You know me. I love a good myth.

800
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,650
He took your place. What...

801
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,890
When you created Flashpoint,

802
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,060
you unwittingly provided me with the means for my return.

803
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,380
Wally...

804
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,260
You gave me the idea to turn Wally into Kid Flash,

805
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:56,810
to make him fast enough to replace me

806
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,270
in your prison.

807
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,150
His youth and ego were my allies.

808
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,020
So taken with his fame and speed,

809
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,610
he never saw he was running right into my trap.

810
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,380
How do I get him out?

811
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,530
Wally's gone.

812
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,890
How do I get him out?

813
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,040
Suffering in an endless void for all eternity.

814
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,460
Another victim Barry Allen failed to save.

815
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,910
No!

816
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,780
I'm gonna kill you!

817
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:39,510
If you had the strength to end my life,

818
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,530
you would have done it in the future.

819
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,450
But Barry Allen doesn't kill. He's the good guy.

820
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,390
The boy Joe raised. The man Iris loves.

821
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,290
You have everything.

822
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,520
And deserve none of it.

823
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,770
I'm going to destroy this city like I did in the future,

824
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,110
so you can see the truth, Barry.

825
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:07,430
And then, you'll treat me like a god.

826
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,850
You're not a God!

827
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,490
Who are you?

828
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,050
I am the future, Flash.

829
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,380
Show your face.

830
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,110
I want so badly to kill you,

831
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,410
and I will.

832
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,080
But you have to live a little while longer.

833
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,750
Long enough to see Iris die.

834
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,320
The blade didn't hit your organs,

835
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,800
but it did shatter your clavicle.

836
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,170
Hang in there, man, hang in there.

837
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,580
- We have to take it out. - Do it!

838
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,560
Any medicine I give you

839
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,260
your metabolism will burn through.

840
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,290
All right. Just do it, okay?

841
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,880
- Just do it. - Hold him down.

842
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,830
- Okay. - Gonna be okay, mate.

843
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,910
- You're gonna be okay. - Bite down on this.

844
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm so sorry.

845
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,100
Three, two, one.

846
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,050
- How long was I out? - Not long.

847
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,200
Are you in much pain?

848
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,270
I might be able to do something with this.

849
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,160
Joe.

850
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,570
I'm sorry.

851
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,670
I'm sorry.

852
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,700
Not your fault.

853
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,540
Where is he?

854
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,370
I mean, is he in pain? Is he...

855
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,130
One will suffer a fate worse than death.

856
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,120
Jesse, I...

857
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,250
I'm not like your dad. I don't really...

858
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,920
know what the right words are--

859
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:35,300
What are we gonna do?

860
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,090
We have to bring him back. We have to save him...

861
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,200
I can't lose Wally, Barry.

862
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,610
I'm sorry.

863
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm gonna work on this.

864
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,350
Yeah. I'll see you soon.

865
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,900
I'm sorry.

866
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,180
I should have never...

867
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,020
- I was afraid. - I know.

868
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,410
Believe me, I know.

869
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,270
Fear makes us do a lot of things that we shouldn't.

870
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,960
My fear's the reason for all of this.
