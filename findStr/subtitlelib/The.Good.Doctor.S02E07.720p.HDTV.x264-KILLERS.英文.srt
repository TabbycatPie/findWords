20
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,390
Previously on "The Good Doctor"...

21
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,310
Coming back to California and moving in with you --

22
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,150
it's been harder than I anticipated.

23
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,450
Hershey meant - everything to me, Shaun.

24
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,080
I took the biggest chance of my life going back there.

25
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,870
And then it just went away.

26
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,310
Deep brain stimulation

27
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,820
was used to treat anorexia.

28
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
You want to use brain surgery for a psychiatric disorder?

29
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,440
DBS isn't FDA-approved for anorexia treatment here.

30
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,330
It's not a real option.

31
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,710
My wife's decided against the valve-repair surgery,

32
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,000
at least until she's tried the deep brain stimulation.

33
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,310
You won't be a part of the surgery.

34
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,860
Or any of my surgeries.

35
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,290
You went around me, directly to the patient.

36
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,030
You're booting me off your service?

37
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:47,000
{\an1}BGM: I Feel It All by Feist

He's... very affectionate.

42
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:57,490
Yeah.

43
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,820
Cats are smart and independent.

44
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,020
I don't think my first pet

45
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,930
should be something I'm allergic to.

46
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,280
Did you know constrictors don't crush their prey?

47
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,310
They induce arterial circulatory collapse.

He looks like a Hubert.

51
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,140
The PH should be maintained

52
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,880
within a range of 7.1 to 7.3.

53
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,890
And we're supposed to add 3 drops of Klor-out

54
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,870
to neutralize the tap water.

55
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,790
Don't worry, Hubert.

56
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,870
Daddy just shows his love in a different way.

57
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,160
No. You don't come by for a month, and then you think

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,270
a store-bought pie is gonna make it all right?

59
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,960
It's from the Farmer's Market.

60
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,820
Fine. Hand it over.

61
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,360
Bring it in.

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
Thanks for coming.

63
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,350
How is she?

64
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,540
Why didn't you tell me things were getting so bad?

65
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,510
- I would have come. - You're busy.

66
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:31,040
I will always make time for you, Kay.

67
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,910
Good, 'cause you're not leaving

68
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,490
until the three of us finish a bottle of Merlot.

69
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,820
Did you call that oncologist

71
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,140
doing the new ovarian cancer PARP-I trial?

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,120
The intake doctor said I don't have the right tumor markers.

73
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,590
Then you need to go back to your hos--

74
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,230
My --

75
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,120
My team put me on hospice last week.

76
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,690
Do you want a dose of morphine?

77
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,120
No. I got it.

78
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,680
Just give it a minute to pass.

79
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,510
Her doctors keep upping the dosage,

80
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,920
but it's not helping anymore.

81
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,000
Nothing is.

82
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,260
My college roommate was diagnosed

83
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,070
with stage 4 ovarian cancer a year ago.

84
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,100
She's had six cycles of Carbo-Taxol

85
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,070
without cyto-reductive surgery due to widespread disease.

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,910
They stopped chemo when she stopped responding.

87
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,090
She has a month at most.

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,620
Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that, Claire.

89
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,600
As am I.

90
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,710
And I assume you're not here just seeking sympathy.

91
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,050
I have reviewed her scans and she can't be cured,

92
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,580
but this metastatic lesion extending through her diaphragm

93
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,520
is causing most of her pain.

94
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,690
Her surgeon has ruled out removing it

95
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,350
due to vascular complexity.

96
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,390
But I think laparoscopic debulking is possible.

97
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Difficult, but possible.

98
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,930
I know you're upset with me,

99
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,860
but sh-she's my friend and she's in pain.

100
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,230
I need your help.

101
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,840
I'll take a look at her today.

102
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,300
Thank you.

103
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,420
We need a surgeon over here!

104
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,990
He fell down the stairs at a construction site

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,070
while holding a nail gun.

106
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,120
Portable head X-ray, stat. Any other injuries?

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,580
Nah. Just yank it off and slap a Band-Aid.

108
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,060
- Any weakness? - No.

109
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,620
All right. On my count.

110
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,060
One, two, three.

111
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
Let's get you that Band-Aid.

112
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,210
We could have done that for free at home

113
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,570
with a pair of vise grips.

114
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,990
You don't pay for our equipment.

115
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,050
You pay for me to tell you that he got lucky.

116
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,220
It's superficial.

117
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,990
His pressure's dropping.

118
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,060
- You feeling faint? - A little banged up.

119
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,550
All right, something else is going on.

120
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,720
Let's log-roll him.

121
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,020
What's wrong with my brother?

122
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,500
I see a puncture wound in his flank.

123
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,140
There's a nail in his abdomen, too.

124
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,570
Let's get him up to the O.R.

125
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,370
How bad is the pain?

126
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,060
Maybe a six.

127
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,140
She's lying.

128
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,460
She, uh, hides it well,

129
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,170
but she's in terrible pain all the time.

130
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,730
But Claire said you're not out of options

131
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,930
until Dr. Melendez says you are.

132
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,230
So, am I?

133
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,560
I think we can make things a little easier for you.

134
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,350
How soon?

135
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,730
Dr. Park and I will do it today.

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,570
What about Claire?

137
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,070
I came here because of her.

138
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,650
Dr. Park is excellent.

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,550
You're in very capable hands.

140
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,150
When my doctors gave up on me, Claire found a way.

141
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,490
I trust her. I won't do this surgery without her.

142
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,350
Dr. Park and Dr. Browne will prep you for surgery.

143
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,850
Now try that again.

144
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,800
Show me.

145
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,320
- Straight. - Straight.

146
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,630
Straight. Yeah.

147
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,800
Oh, almost.

148
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,860
And pull back up.

149
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,480
That's good.

150
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,900
Thank you.

151
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,880
The nail completely ruptured the kidney.

152
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,480
Renal hilum's blown, too.

153
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,710
4-0 on a driver.

154
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,060
This isn't working. Clamp the renal vessels.

155
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,520
He's gonna have to live without it.

156
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,340
Expose the other kidney,

157
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,120
make sure it's got that new-car smell.

158
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,130
The adrenal gland is low-lying.

159
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,210
You won't find the left kidney there.

160
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,670
You expect her to find it on the right?

161
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,980
No. The most likely reason

162
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,510
for the gland to be lower is unilateral renal agenesis.

163
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,010
He was born with one kidney.

164
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,020
Is that the vena cava?

165
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,920
There's so much tumor in there,

166
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,580
it's hard to tell what anything is.

167
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,350
I need to free this segment without nicking that vein or...

168
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,700
Park, pull on that fragment very carefully.

169
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,910
Got it.

170
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,300
All right. Claire, I need you to tilt --

171
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,060
Exactly.

172
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,090
The tumor's invaded the vessel wall.

173
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,240
I think you got it.

174
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,060
Why isn't there tumor tissue penetrating her diaphragm?

175
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,810
The CT scan showed --

176
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,980
The segment we removed was displacing the diaphragm upward,

177
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,240
giving the appearance of chest infiltration.

178
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,430
If the cancer's just in her abdomen,

179
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,940
she could be a candidate for HIPEC treatment.

180
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,190
Treatment?

181
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,430
Not pain relief?

182
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,420
We may be able to give her a little more time.

183
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,270
It's called HIPEC surgery.

184
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,300
I'd remove as much tumor as possible,

185
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,680
and then we'd infuse your abdomen

186
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,370
with a chemotherapy solution for 90 minutes.

187
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,260
It could give you another six months.

188
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,110
It comes with a big risk.

189
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,720
This is a major operation, and your body's frail.

190
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,230
You could die on the table.

191
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,300
I-I want more time.

192
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,990
But her pain is finally manageable.

193
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,470
I-I'm afraid to press our luck anymore.

194
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,190
The thought of gambling away your last few weeks

195
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,300
terrifies me, too, but this wasn't luck.

196
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,460
Dr. Melendez has proved that despite all of the challenges

197
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,740
of your cancer, he can safely navigate inside your abdomen.

198
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,290
I think it's worth putting your trust in him again.

199
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,490
Okay.

200
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,540
We'll start with a complete PET-CT scan

201
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,890
so we can plan our approach.

202
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,230
He has extensive vein thrombosis.

203
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,890
There's a clear segment we can use

204
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,530
for an AV dialysis graft.

205
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,300
It's short, but we can attach it to the brachial artery --

206
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,250
Hello, Lea.

207
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,860
I'm sorry, but I can't talk right --

208
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,290
There's a problem with Hubert.

209
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,800
Oh, okay.

210
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,160
Yeah. The PH is exactly 7.2,

211
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,780
temp's 73, everything is perfect.

212
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,910
Perfect.

213
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,060
He looks bored.

214
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,450
Bored?

215
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,770
He can't be bored.

216
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,420
He's a fish.

217
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,270
He's just floating there with nothing to do.

218
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,180
I thought you were working today.

219
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,630
I was -- from home.

220
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,210
Now I'm procrastinating with Hubert.

221
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,470
You should work.

222
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,170
Okay, can you pick up one of those little castles?

223
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,660
Okay.

224
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
I'm not sure who's being domesticated --

225
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,200
you or the fish.

226
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,510
Uh, yes, I'm still here.

227
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,990
Call us if anything changes.

228
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,140
Due to his tissue type,

229
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,340
UNOS doesn't expect to locate a match in time.

230
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,680
We'll need to find a living donor.

231
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,790
You did a great job today.

232
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,170
You want some pirate booty and a juice box with that?

233
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,650
You keep me waiting for hours on end.

234
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,040
Now at least I have something to do.

235
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,400
Cancer is keeping you waiting.

236
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,240
- Yeah. - We're ready for you.

237
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,520
- Here you go. - Oh, you can keep that.

238
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,230
Oh, thank you.

239
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,690
Bye.

240
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,110
That story is not gonna end well, is it?

241
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,810
You know, the yo-yo has been around

242
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,090
for 1,400 years, since ancient China.

243
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,070
Watch this.

244
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,660
You're not my only patient.

245
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,050
Remembering and executing these tricks

246
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,080
will help with my sequential memory

247
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,530
and protect my brain against your radiation.

248
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,550
With this new targeted therapy, I can better focus

249
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,290
on just knocking the things out of your head that I want to.

250
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,340
Of course I'm also - making a little wish list

251
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,220
about other things I might want to get rid of.

252
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,850
I'm worried.

253
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,040
Whether it's tomorrow or a few months from now,

254
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,740
Dash is gonna lose me.

255
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,320
And he'll be devastated.

256
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,340
He's an amazing, loving husband.

257
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,770
I want you to go out with him.

258
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,460
What?

259
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,860
You two get along.

260
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,410
You even have chemistry.

261
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,940
No. We're friends.

262
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,870
If Dash is gonna move on with his life,

263
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,600
he needs something to live for.

264
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,420
I think that could be you.

265
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,690
We need to begin now.

266
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,340
Okay.

267
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,410
Don't say a word.

268
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,980
It's none of my business.

269
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,510
- Dash seems like a nice guy. - Shut up.

270
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:12,430
You're a perfect match.

271
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,040
- Great. - We just need you to sign the consent forms.

272
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,830
Donation carries several risks,

273
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,160
including blood clots, infection, hemorrhage,

274
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,720
lung collapse, and possibly death.

275
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,390
There are also lifelong risks,

276
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,330
such as high blood pressure, which can cause a heart attack,

277
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,300
and protein-losing nephropathy,

278
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,910
which can impair your remaining kidney,

279
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,370
leading to the need for a transplant yourself.

280
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,830
It's a big ask.

281
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,220
Yes, it is.

282
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,170
I'm happy to sign the forms on one condition.

283
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,300
I'm not selling the business.

284
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,540
I told you 10 times.

285
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,460
We're not taking that offer.

286
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,410
Either sell or buy me out at the same price.

287
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,510
You know I can't afford that.

288
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,170
I can't afford anything.

289
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,510
Look, Dad left you in charge,

290
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,770
but all of my money is tied up in it.

291
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,340
I got investment opportunities.

292
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,500
I got things that I'm excited about.

293
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,850
Dad left me in charge because when things got tough,

294
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,310
you took off to college while we rebuilt.

295
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,460
- And now you want to cash in? - We'll both cash in.

296
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,930
The deal I negotiated is way over-market.

297
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,600
I don't care how good the deal is.

298
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,610
- I like what I do. - And I like my kidney.

299
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,070
It seems we both need to make a sacrifice.

300
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,870
I'm not selling.

301
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,830
Kayla's back in her room.

302
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,910
We finished her staging,

303
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,440
and everything supports our operative plan.

304
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,040
Do you have any questions about her upcoming surgery?

305
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,350
Did Kay bring up anything about, uh...

306
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:04,970
us?

307
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,170
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

308
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,840
I told her not to do that.

309
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,270
I mean, it's, uh --

310
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,200
it's nuts, you know?

311
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,530
Well, that's a little insulting.

312
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,250
I'm kidding.

313
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,270
It's insane.

314
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,590
Just, you know --

315
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,640
we'll just forget she mentioned it, okay?

316
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,700
Will she?

317
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,100
I mean, we've both said no.

318
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,040
What's she gonna do?

319
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,240
You've been married to her eight years.

320
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,860
You still ask that question?

321
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,420
Well, we, uh, do have one other choice.

322
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,690
You guys have a chapel here, right?

323
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,580
He's exploiting this situation.

324
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,810
Yes. He's entitled to.

325
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,350
You don't think an organ donation should be an altruistic act?

326
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,920
Can it be?

327
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,590
A majority of donors do it

328
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,790
to make their own lives more worthwhile,

329
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,100
and almost a quarter do it

330
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,460
to relieve guilt over a past mistake.

331
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,080
Redemption, meaning, sure, but not money.

332
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,450
So, you never take an opportunity to get ahead

333
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,720
at someone else's expense?

334
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,490
I'm competing, not trafficking organs.

335
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,840
I need Armando's kidney.

336
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,480
And I need it without getting dragged into their family drama,

337
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,990
which is why I have residents.

338
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,670
So you two find a way to make it happen.

339
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,120
This central line will allow us to monitor your heart

340
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,490
during tomorrow's surgery.

341
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,990
Have you considered my proposal?

342
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,820
I have been more focused on your surgery

343
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,050
than seducing your husband.

344
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,630
Typical.

345
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,930
You got me.

346
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,430
I'm not dating my cancer-riddled friend's husband

347
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,800
because I have commitment issues.

348
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,840
You've been sprinting away from men as long as I've known you.

349
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,750
Yeah.

350
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,320
I will find the time when I have the time.

351
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,170
It will never be the right time.

352
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,400
You're afraid to get hurt.

353
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,770
I know how short life is.

354
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,310
I don't want you to miss out on the best part of it.

355
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,440
All done.

356
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,650
What do I owe you for the therapy session?

357
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,880
Date my husband.

358
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,160
Do you know how stupid that sounds?

359
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,590
I want someone to take care of the man that I love.

360
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,110
- Does that sound stupid? - Yes, very, but...

361
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,040
Please.

362
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,120
Please, would you just drop this?

363
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,590
I will drop this. If...one date.

364
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,790
One dinner. That's all.

365
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,070
But a real one, not a latte in the café.

366
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,100
I want a real date -- appetizers, main course, wine.

367
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,400
- I'm on call. - No wine. But candles.

368
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,630
I want candles.

369
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,430
One date. I will never mention any of this again.

370
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,780
It's a federal crime to barter a human organ

371
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,910
for anything of value.

372
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,560
I'm not selling Santiago anything.

373
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,320
You're receiving money from a third party

374
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,760
in exchange for your kidney.

375
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,740
He's receiving money from a third party for his business.

376
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,050
So is his brother.

377
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,660
He should love him enough to not --

378
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,090
I love him enough to give him a kidney.

379
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,710
He should love me enough to accept an offer

380
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,300
that would improve my life, too.

381
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,650
I mean, it's a much lower ask than a vital organ.

382
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,490
You're not allowed to ask for anything.

383
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,370
Are you saying that if he agrees

384
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,680
you're not gonna perform the surgery?

385
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,320
- He doesn't agree. - He will.

386
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,720
Everything in life is transactional,

387
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,460
and in this case, I've got all the leverage.

388
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,090
- Leverage? - It's what you have that they need.

389
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,620
It's how you shift a deal in your favor.

390
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,620
You guys have no leverage and no cards to play.

391
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes, we do.

392
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,130
I don't believe you're willing to let your brother die.

393
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,840
A good negotiator doesn't bluff.

394
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,900
If you cave on a threat, you lose all credibility.

395
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,420
And Santiago knows I'm a good negotiator.

396
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,640
So he won't die

397
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,420
precisely because I'm willing to let him.

398
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,810
I'll talk to your brother.

399
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,800
Okay.

400
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,770
How long do we have to stay?

401
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,170
She said dinner, so I assume till we're done eating?

402
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,200
Okay.

403
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,600
- Dessert? - Do you want any?

404
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,030
- Not really. - I think we're good.

405
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,650
- Okay. - Okay.

406
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,060
Look at that old clock.

407
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,590
It's the same as the one that they had at Meline's, off campus.

408
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,030
Oh, yeah.

409
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,100
Hey, remember that time we went there on that double date?

410
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,290
You set me up with your English T.A.

411
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,290
Yeah. Kay said it was a bad idea.

412
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,000
I just remember him droning on about

413
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,920
Dryden's influence on 18th-century literature.

414
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,880
If you hadn't stepped in,

415
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,200
I think I might have stabbed him with my salad fork. -

416
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,380
Ah, Kay always knew better.

417
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,890
Yeah. She fixed me up three times.

418
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,760
Then she gave up.

419
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,750
Until now.

420
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,970
You should sell the business.

421
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,680
Excuse me?

422
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,560
You would live.

423
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,790
And you could take the proceeds and start a new business

424
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,360
without your brother as a partner.

425
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,570
It's a good deal.

426
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,410
Benitez Builders is my father's legacy.

427
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,120
He built it from nothing.

428
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,410
He was committed, hardworking, honorable.

429
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,960
He expected the same thing from both of us.

430
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,590
My dad was difficult to please.

431
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,650
I worked hard to be someone that my father could be proud of.

432
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,560
And I'm the one he trusted with the controlling share.

433
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,270
I'd rather die than let him down.

434
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,330
Is that bothering you?

435
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,820
Yeah. A little bit.

436
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,580
The graft is failing.

437
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,290
What's happening?

438
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,570
Infusing heparin. He's hypercoagulable.

439
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,140
The tunnel catheter is gonna clot off just like the graft.

440
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,860
That gives him even less leverage.

441
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,600
It should convince Santiago to accept his brother's offer.

442
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,310
Santiago? Why him?

443
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,660
I'm negotiating.

444
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,190
With the wrong brother.

445
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,240
The catheter's already obstructing.

446
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,540
Whatever we're doing,

447
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,780
it needs to happen in the next couple of days.

448
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,330
We'll do a live donor drive.

449
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,950
Okay.

450
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,500
One in 100,000 chance of success,

451
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,310
but better than planning his funeral.

452
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,000
I think the odds are better than that.

453
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,170
We don't need to find a match.

454
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,360
We just need the parade of selfless family members

455
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,640
to embarrass Armando

456
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,010
into doing the right thing.

457
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,260
Evening, roomie.

458
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,060
Evening, roomie.

459
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,690
Hubert is dead.

460
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,610
Yeah.

461
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,490
That's odd.

462
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,380
I'm not sure if I overfed him

463
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,140
or if it was when I changed the water to clean his pebbles,

464
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,250
but, yeah, definitely dead.

465
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,210
We can get another fish.

466
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,010
We don't need to.

467
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,390
There are many fish in the sea.

468
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,800
I said no.

469
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,360
You wanted a pet.

470
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,390
I got one.

471
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,910
Very briefly.

472
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,980
- I'll go tomorrow and -- - No!

473
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,210
Are you crying?

474
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,630
Are you sad?

475
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,970
I'm sad.

476
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,890
And I'm angry and frustrated and upset.

477
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,450
We should get another fish.

478
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,810
The fish isn't the problem.

479
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,810
I am.

480
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,190
I'm pathetic.

481
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,420
I went home to Hershey

482
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,820
because I was unfulfilled with my life.

483
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,470
I thought I could help my bullheaded brother

484
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,040
save the shop,

485
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,620
be a part of something I was really passionate about.

486
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,290
Instead, we ended up tanking it together,

487
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,940
along with our relationship.

488
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,170
I came back here to get my life back on track.

489
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,360
How am I supposed to do that

490
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,590
if I can't even keep a damn fish alive?

491
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,580
I'll make it through this.

492
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,110
It is okay to be afraid.

493
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,700
How was your dinner with Dash?

494
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,030
Forget about that.

495
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,450
How are you?

496
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,180
If I don't make it, you have to give this thing

497
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,470
- with Dash a real shot. - Kayla, please stop.

498
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,580
Promise me. You have to.

499
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,040
No.

500
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,460
You can't put that on me.

501
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,880
That's right. Claire never turns her back on a friend,

502
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,600
as long as it doesn't put her heart at risk.

503
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,810
That is not fair.

504
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:11,910
What you're asking...

505
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,780
I'm asking you to trust my judgment

506
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,700
- about the two of you. - No, you're trying to pressure me

507
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,200
into something that I don't want.

508
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,710
- Like you always do. - You need pushing

509
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,110
because you've never known what's best for you.

510
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,880
So, is that why you dragged me out

511
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,660
to pledge week to be rejected by every sorority on campus?

512
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,470
Or -- or went behind my back

513
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,310
and invited my mother to graduation?

514
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,850
At least you tried.

515
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,960
- You put something at risk. - No.

516
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,900
Give me a break.

517
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,270
This was never about me, none of it.

518
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,930
You always have to have it your way.

519
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,070
You are a neurotic control freak

520
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,360
who thinks she has the right to dictate

521
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,560
how everyone else should live their lives.

522
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,900
It's time.

523
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,810
I'm ready.

524
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,110
Kayla...

525
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,140
I'm sure you recognize Rafael,

526
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,720
your second cousin from Oxnard.

527
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,350
He drove up as soon as he heard.

528
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,990
Either we get lucky here and you look like an ass,

529
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,560
or we don't and you look like an ass with a dead brother.

530
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:47,450
He won't give his life for a contracting company.

531
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,950
He's not dying for the company.

532
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,870
He's dying for your father.

533
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,120
What makes you think that?

534
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,960
He would rather die than let your father down.

535
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,340
He thinks that's what Dad would want?

536
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,700
Santi did everything the old man asked of him,

537
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,580
worked twice as hard,

538
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,340
did everything twice as well as Dad ever could,

539
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,230
but nothing was ever good enough for our father.

540
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,580
No matter what we did, he was always right there

541
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,150
to point out where we had gone wrong.

542
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,110
You know what he told me on his deathbed?

543
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,090
He said that he wasn't proud of Santi

544
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,870
for following in his footsteps --

545
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,700
that he was disappointed that he settled.

546
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,630
You should tell your brother that.

547
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,500
It's a good card to play.

548
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,970
He was wrong.

549
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,040
You are the most loyal, hardworking,

550
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,020
and principled guy I've ever known.

551
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,360
And you deserve Dad's respect.

552
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,990
You greedy, lying snake.

553
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,950
You will say anything to get what you want,

554
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,850
even trying to ruin - the memories I have of Dad.

555
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,060
Your memories of Dad?

556
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,330
He was horrible. You know that.

557
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,500
Get the hell out.

558
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,000
- Santi, I'm not trying to -- - Get out!

559
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,660
Give me the consent forms.

560
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:15,130
My father told me he wished I hadn't been born.

561
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,640
I wasn't worth the trouble.

562
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:26,190
But I knew I was worth the trouble

563
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,900
because my brother always looked out for me...

564
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,160
...even when it made his life harder.

565
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,330
5-0 prolene.

566
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,170
Position the kidney in the pelvis.

567
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,300
Dr. Murphy.

568
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,320
Your stat cultures came back positive

569
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,510
for ichthyophthirius multifiliis.

570
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,390
Thank you.

571
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,600
It's not for this patient.

572
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,370
Do you need to deal with it?

573
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,270
It's too late.

574
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,200
You have a security problem.

575
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,430
I will get my badge and my gun.

576
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,960
Somebody stole my wallet out of the locker.

577
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,470
Are you sure you left it there?

578
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,960
Yes. I'm sure.

579
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,400
You were worried about it getting stolen,

580
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,270
so you gave this to me before your session today.

581
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,480
Mine.

582
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,440
Sorry.

583
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,190
Stupid.

584
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,320
Don't read anything into this.

585
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,300
How is she?

586
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,810
We removed a lot of the tumor

587
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,880
and she's having the chemotherapy bath now.

588
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,500
So far, she's doing well.

589
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:36,880
Okay.

590
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,860
- Kayla would want you to eat. - Yeah.

591
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,940
- Yeah. - Of course she would.

592
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,680
She'd forget to eat herself.

593
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,310
Man, I-I really hate all --all this waiting.

594
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:50,100
Okay. Just sit.

595
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,310
Breathe.

596
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,030
Kayla's dealt with so much

597
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,610
prodding and nausea,

598
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,870
fatigue...and so much pain.

599
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,870
I just wish she would let me do something for her to

600
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,080
make things easier.

601
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,300
I want to protect my wife.

602
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,260
Instead, I'm just sitting here, waiting...

603
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,180
waiting for her to die.

604
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,630
Dash, I'm sorry.

605
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,610
They need me back in the O.R.

606
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,000
Push another 60 of lasix.

607
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,390
MAP is 26.

608
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,380
She's in cardiopulmonary collapse.

609
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,820
Second chest tube in.

610
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,970
SATS are still dropping on 100%.

611
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,030
It has to be heart failure.

612
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,280
We need to crash her onto ECMO.

613
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,770
Her cardiac index was fine.

614
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,120
It must be toxic inflammatory reaction to the chemo.

615
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,400
She's intolerant.

616
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,770
Stop the chemo.

617
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,800
What if the fluid buildup isn't a reaction to the chemo bath?

618
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,570
What if it is the chemo bath?

619
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,050
Her -- her mediastinum is widening.

620
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,720
If her diaphragm perforated,

621
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,220
fluid could be leaking into her chest, compressing her heart.

622
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,640
The tumor we removed yesterday was clinging to her diaphragm.

623
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,090
If we close the hole, she can finish her treatment.

624
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,050
Let's re-open her incision.

625
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,980
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

626
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,110
His kidney numbers are starting to improve.

627
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,620
Take me back to my room, Doc.

628
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,620
Manny...

629
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,500
thanks for the kidney.

630
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:24,630
You're welcome.

631
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,230
Just don't come looking for another one

632
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,760
without a big check in your hand.

633
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,340
Jerk.

634
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,530
That's good.

635
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,780
You're just in time for some, uh, celebratory ice chips.

636
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,010
- Kay, I'm sorry -- - Don't be.

637
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,010
You weren't entirely wrong.

638
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,790
I --

639
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,460
I can be a little manipulative.

640
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,300
No.

641
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,260
No, I was wrong.

642
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,440
You don't try to control everything

643
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,850
because you think you know better than everyone else.

644
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,140
You do it because you're a caring friend.

645
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,560
You focus all your energy

646
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:29,360
trying to protect us from pain and suffering, and --

647
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,070
and that lets you not think about your own.

648
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,700
But you have to.

649
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,050
You are dying, Kayla.

650
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,550
I know.

651
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,470
You're dying...

652
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,980
and it is not fair.

653
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,940
And it is painful and scary.

654
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,540
- And it feels like you're all alone with it. - Please, stop.

655
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,110
But you're not.

656
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,910
Dash is here.

657
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,790
So am I.

658
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,170
Thank you for everything you did.

659
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,070
Of course.

660
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,740
I, um -- I meant what I said to Kayla.

661
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,950
You really are the most gifted surgeon I have ever worked with.

662
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,540
You did well today.

663
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,510
Thanks.

664
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,770
I'll report back to Dr. Lim in the morning

665
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,840
if that's what you want.

666
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,770
Yeah, that's probably for the best.

667
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,780
Shaun, I don't need another fish.

668
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,050
I don't want another fish.

669
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:37,920
I do.

670
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,710
Our goldfish died.

671
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,620
You need to provide a replacement.

672
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,100
Store policy -- once a fish leaves this store,

673
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,760
all responsibility for its well-being falls up--

674
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:51,380
Hubert had ichthyophthirius multifiliis,

675
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,220
a common goldfish parasite picked up in pet stores.

676
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,430
You have no leverage and no cards to play.

677
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,070
Pick a fish.

678
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:23,000
{\an1}BGM: This Is the Day by The The

679
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,790
You didn't kill Hubert.

680
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,000
He was defective.

681
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,210
We'll try again.

682
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,590
