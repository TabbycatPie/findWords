18
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,960
I stand by my original statement.

19
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,880
Officer Doyle had no probable cause.

20
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,500
Atwater snitched on the police.

21
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,030
Every time I see a cop, I get nervous.

22
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,630
He's gotta pay the price.

23
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,040
Blue Wall is a tricky thing.

24
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,830
- Step out of the vehicle. - Look, I'm police.

25
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,040
Is this really what you want to do?

26
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,090
Black man?

27
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,570
It's gotta stop now before someone gets hurt.

28
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,740
You--you kidding me? You know it's 6:00 A.M.?

29
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,320
Yeah, I got work in the field.

30
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,900
What even is all this?

31
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,410
A new security system.

32
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,930
Cameras on every door,

33
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:52,400
sensors all over the house.

34
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,520
Right. What?

35
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,230
Maybe the beatdown was the end of it?

36
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,860
- Or the beginning. - Look, bro, come on.

37
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,510
Maybe the white cops will finally realize

38
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,160
that they're the racist pricks

39
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,860
on the wrong end of a revolution.

40
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,910
Revolutions ain't ever that fast, Jordan.

41
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm not gonna be driving my car so much.

42
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,110
What else do you think they're gonna do to your car?

43
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,470
If anybody's here that shouldn't be, you let me know.

44
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,960
Clean this up, all right?

47
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,130
You good, Kev?

48
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,710
Yeah...

49
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,810
- I think they locked me out. - Meaning?

50
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,420
The system's not letting me in.

51
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,360
My radio doesn't work.

52
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,510
I don't have any access.

53
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,790
What happened?

54
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,150
They jumped me.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,580
Did you see their faces?

56
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,550
Their faces were covered. There were no cameras.

57
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,230
They didn't say a word. They were smart.

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,850
- Okay, let me find them- - You can't go to IAD.

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,890
I'm guessing they've already got an open case on me.

60
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,950
Nolan has men inside, so we can't trust that.

61
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,280
And I have absolutely nothing on them still.

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,700
Which is why I'd go elsewhere.

63
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,910
I appreciate that,

64
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,160
but this is what we knew was coming.

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,050
Kev, there are ways--

66
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,880
Sarge, we already talked about this.

67
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,030
And I already talked to the team.

68
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,500
I can handle them. I'm good.

69
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,870
Okay.

70
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,240
Well, come on. We caught a case.

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,400
Sergeant Voight.

72
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,640
911 call came in about eight minutes ago.

73
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,300
- What was the call? - Injured female.

74
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,950
A male caller reporting his friend hurt.

75
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,890
Patrol arrived, entered, found a deceased female.

76
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,650
- Okay. - Male caller inside with her.

77
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,740
Sir, the male inside is Billy Braddem.

78
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,220
- As in Alderman Braddem? - It's his son.

79
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,800
- The ex-cop, right? - Yup.

80
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,880
- Talk to me. - She was already stiff.

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,070
Died hours ago. Probably around 2:00 A.M.

82
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,690
Kid won't move. He's high out of his mind.

83
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,350
You want us to help her, you need to let her go.

84
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,940
- Found him like this? - Yeah.

85
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,770
Listen to me...

86
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,700
- Or I'll have to remove you. - I got it, we got it.

87
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,070
- Kev. - She needs help.

88
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,570
I can hear her breathing.

89
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,260
Hey. Billy, I'm Kev. Can you look at me?

90
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,800
She's breathing.

91
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,940
I can hear her too. I can hear her.

92
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,120
I'm gonna step closer so I can hear her better,

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,460
but I need you to let her go.

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,010
Here. Set the knife down.

95
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,450
We wanna help her.

96
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,890
So just put the knife down.

97
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,950
You gotta work with us.

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,250
Billy, listen to me. Just like that.

99
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,180
there you go. There you go.

100
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,830
Yeah, we're good.

101
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,470
All right? We just wanna help her.

102
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,840
- We're gonna help her. - I love her, I love--

103
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,480
Come on, okay, okay.

104
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,590
Please help her, please.

106
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,750
The victim's IDed as Isla Sherman,

107
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,940
18 years of age.

108
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,140
She's got a few priors for drug possession as a juvie,

109
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,300
but other than that, I mean, she's a bit of a ghost.

110
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,420
It looks like she was an addict.

111
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,180
No LKAs in years other than the place that she died.

112
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,460
- You locate the family? - Yeah.

113
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,220
I tracked her mom down to Arizona.

114
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,450
She was surprised Isla was still alive actually.

115
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,450
Written her off as dead a long time ago.

116
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,070
- Won't be claiming the body. - And what about Billy?

117
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,810
Oh, with him, I had to do some digging.

118
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,400
Alderman Braddem never mentions Billy in his stump speeches.

119
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,500
Kid's never one of the sons

120
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,780
standing behind him at the podium.

121
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,360
He's got no public traces.

122
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,190
I did find him logged as a patient

123
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,230
at more than a dozen rehabs, though.

124
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,030
Yeah, his school records are a mess.

125
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,790
I mean, this kid's been in and out of a different school

126
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,520
every year since he was 14.

127
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,780
So we think Braddem kicked him out of the house?

128
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,280
Yeah, I mean, that would be my guess.

129
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,560
I can't figure out his relationship to Isla, though.

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,910
Friends, boyfriend, maybe they just use together?

131
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm scouring social media--

132
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,190
She's been waiting for you for over an hour.

133
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,290
We're halfway to that being her permanent office,

134
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,550
so could you, please?

135
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
Yeah, I'm back.

136
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,900
Deputy.

137
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,820
Have you got any baking soda in your office?

138
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,550
I don't.

139
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,080
- One of those stain pens? - Sorry.

140
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,130
That's a shame.

141
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,650
I read your crime scene report--

142
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,510
You wanna know if I know the Alderman?

143
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,660
I'm just guessing where this is headed.

144
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,040
The answer's no, I've never met Alderman Braddem.

145
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,770
Okay, because this is one of those instances

146
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,620
where CPD must enact equality in law enforcement.

147
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,400
Sure.

148
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,010
Meaning absolutely zero Blue Wall

149
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,100
or preferential treatment for an Alderman's son.

150
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,380
Yeah, lucky I never met the man.

151
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,820
- I won't be protecting his son. - Okay, great.

152
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,240
And I'm still gonna ask you to press murder charges ASAP.

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,430
You know, questioning an offender who's not coherent--

154
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,140
Is better than affording an offender

155
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,050
an extra 12 hours before questioning.

156
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,750
- To get sober. - Or to rehearse.

157
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,970
Look. We're gonna treat his kid like any other offender.

158
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,620
You take his blood, you document his tox,

159
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,170
question him, and charge.

160
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,960
Asap.

161
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,640
You know, we don't have to go 12 rounds every time.

162
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,230
I'm gonna give you an order. That's my job.

163
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,510
But we can be nice.

164
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,580
Can you see this?

165
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,220
I can.

166
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,560
Is it see-through?

167
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,520
It is.

168
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,280
Okay. Deputy Miller.

169
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,840
Hey, Billy.

170
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,340
Billy, look at me.

171
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,870
Look at me.

172
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,380
I'm Sergeant Hank Voight with the CPD.

173
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,680
Hey, Billy.

174
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,800
Do you remember me? We were just downstairs.

175
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,020
We just talked.

176
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,820
Boy, this kid's got no short-term memory whatsoever.

177
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,620
I don't even think he knows where he is.

178
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,600
Billy, do you know why you're here?

179
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,670
Isla?

180
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,500
- Where is she? - She's dead.

181
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,570
Can you tell us what happened to her?

182
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,920
Hey, Billy.

183
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,320
Billy!

184
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,350
The way we found you with the knife,

185
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,700
this is a bad situation, do you understand?

186
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,910
- Do you think I killed her? - I do.

187
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,180
All right, this death looks like

188
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,430
what we call a crime of passion, Billy.

189
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,020
Like a fight broke out, something went wrong,

190
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,890
a knife was grabbed from the kitchen.

191
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,510
I didn't kill her. The--the man killed her.

192
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,330
Okay, the man. What man?

193
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,890
The man in the apartment. He killed her.

194
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,540
- Who was he? - I don't know.

195
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,440
Can you describe what he looked like?

196
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,750
He was white.

197
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,170
He was in his 40s. He...had green eyes.

198
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,070
He was wearing a suit. White shirt.

199
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,630
Blue tie with red stripes on it.

200
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,960
He had this voice like...

201
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,060
It was really light.

202
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,820
And like he was telling a story.

203
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,170
Like he knew what he wanted to say, and...

204
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
You ever seen this man before?

205
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,570
Can I see Isla?

206
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,130
She's dead, Billy.

207
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,770
I just wanna see her again.

208
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,650
Please, just...

209
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,180
tell me where you put her.

210
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,080
You ever hear a suspect description that detailed?

211
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,950
No. Maybe it's the high talking.

212
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,470
That detailed?

213
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,120
Or telling his own story.

214
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,250
I just feel like you gotta be some amount of "Here"

215
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,070
to come up with that, and whether it's true or not,

216
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,620
it seems like he believes it.

217
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,940
And he asked to see the body.

218
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,790
That's not normal offender behavior.

219
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,640
Addicts' behavior doesn't always

220
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,980
match their truth, though.

221
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,180
They know how to lie.

222
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,590
I suppose he could be feeding us a fake suspect.

223
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,780
I don't know.

224
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,560
And we're not gonna know more until he's sober.

225
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,050
Well, he gave us another suspect.

226
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,070
Let's run it.

227
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,810
You really wanna wait to charge?

228
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,670
Until we know he's guilty, yeah.

229
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,250
There's really nothing that would indicate

230
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,360
there was a third person in the apartment.

231
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,890
We got two sets of takeout

232
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,780
and beers surrounding two chairs.

233
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,630
- Two sets of the works. - Not much here.

234
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,720
This place is tiny.

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,350
I know, I really don't see

236
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,010
how somebody could be hiding out.

237
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,080
And the blood splatter indicates just one offender.

239
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,990
TV was on at the time of death.

240
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,090
Yeah, Forensics hasn't dusted this room yet.

241
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,160
They are expected to rise based on positive...

242
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,410
We just wanted to circle back,

243
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,090
make sure Patrol didn't miss anything.

244
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,350
You see anything unusual? Any visitors?

245
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,550
- The car was unusual. - A car?

246
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,450
All right. What car is that?

247
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,970
I don't know. It looked blue, maybe?

248
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,160
2:00 A.M., it just sat out there wasting gas.

249
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,590
Headlights blaring through my window.

250
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,740
Did you see anyone in the car,

251
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,510
or anyone enter or exit the apartment?

252
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,900
No, just the car. I took my dog out.

253
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,510
By the time I came back, it sped away,

254
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,150
but it sat out there 20 minutes.

255
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,330
Why didn't you mention this to Patrol?

256
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,330
No Patrol ever came by. I've been home all day.

257
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,640
Nobody's talked to me.

258
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,160
She died, didn't she?

259
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,250
- That young girl? - Yes, ma'am.

260
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,580
She seemed like a good person.

261
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,700
Seemed like she tried real hard to be happy.

262
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,470
I don't understand. Where is my son?

263
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,750
- Sir, your son's upstairs. - Upstairs.

264
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,120
You've got him in a box? You found him high?

265
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,990
Yes, sir. He was high.

266
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,080
You're questioning my son without a lawyer

267
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,340
while he's high.

268
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,670
Are you kidding me?

269
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,060
Why the hell is he upstairs without a lawyer?

270
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,620
- Listen, I'm happy to talk-- - I am gonna have your badge.

271
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,200
- I'm just doing my job. - You won't be for much longer.

272
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,160
I will tear you apart in front of the media.

273
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,800
And I know who you are. I know how you police.

274
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,960
Alderman Braddem.

275
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,260
Deputy Superintendent Miller.

276
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,670
I want to see my kid. I need to be in there.

277
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,280
And I will help you do that, just not in the hallway

278
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,100
and not while raising our voices.

279
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,450
Right this way.

280
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,990
I'll speak to you upstairs.

281
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,130
McKenzie, you just came here to watch?

282
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,410
That was clearly leaked to Alderman.

283
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,530
Well, it doesn't matter how. We're here now.

284
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,390
Tell me we got something.

285
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,600
I confirmed a blue Sedan outside Isla's apartment

286
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,760
around the time of death.

287
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,930
Caught it coming and going.

288
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,650
Matches the witness' time frame,

289
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,010
but there's no POD outside of Isla's.

290
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,630
So the car turns into her block,

291
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,020
I lose it, and I catch it leaving 20 minutes later.

292
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,470
So we can't confirm the plates

293
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,840
or that it was even outside of Isla's.

294
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,400
It's possible somebody exited the car,

295
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,740
went into the apartment, but we have zero way to prove that.

296
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,000
- Hey, I think I got something. - Okay.

297
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,460
TV was on in Isla's apartment last night,

298
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,190
so I followed a feeling, and this was playing

299
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,400
during the time of death.

300
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,140
Was first indicated in the city's loop, and has--

302
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,510
White male, 40s. Grey hair, green eyes.

303
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,110
Blue and red tie. Suit.

304
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,600
And a voice like he's telling a story.

305
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,800
Can happen during trauma.

306
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,430
Brain's wires get crossed, latches onto the wrong thing.

307
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,540
I don't think Billy has any idea what's real.

308
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,860
Over 12 hours on an open and shut scene,

309
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,110
and now we've got an ex-cop Alderman

310
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,620
in the 21st, meeting with his son's investigator.

311
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,370
- You disobeyed a direct order. - Because it wasn't real.

312
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,750
If I give you an order, it's real.

313
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,450
No, not if you don't tell me why you're giving it to me.

314
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,710
That kid was found holding the murder weapon

315
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,820
- laying next to the dead girl. - I'm aware.

316
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,350
And yet, you haven't charged him.

317
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,680
What if that kid in there were Black?

318
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,050
Would you be ordering me to charge ASAP?

319
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,320
'Cause I think if that were an 18-year-old Black kid in there

320
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,310
with no rich family, no politician father,

321
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,220
you wouldn't be pressing me to charge

322
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,190
until I had the whole of it,

323
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,830
until it felt right.

324
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,180
But he's white, he's privileged,

325
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,620
and you're damn scared the media's gonna

326
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,270
hand you your ass your first month of work.

327
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,400
I don't care who his father is.

328
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,010
You do.

329
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,360
All right.

330
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,860
You take the full 48 if you need to.

331
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,990
I'll make sure you can have it.

332
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,710
No.

333
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,370
No, it's not possible. It was real.

334
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,530
I-I know I was screwed up, okay?

335
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,060
But--but I'm clear now.

336
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,920
Maybe...maybe it wasn't this man.

337
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,150
- Fine, but someone was there. - Billy.

338
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,600
Are you sober now?

339
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,490
Okay, understand this. We got about 32 hours

340
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,770
till we have to either charge or release you.

341
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:13,580
I didn't do this!

342
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,050
That, I don't know. What I do know is

343
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,140
your father and your lawyer are downstairs right now,

344
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,200
and I'm obligated to bring your lawyer up here.

345
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,510
My dad's here?

346
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,120
And he brought his whole team of lawyers?

347
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,360
He thinks I did this.

348
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,260
No. No, you know what? I...

349
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,210
I don't want his lawyers.

350
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,260
I don't want his help. Go ahead. I-

351
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,660
I know there's a form I can sign.

352
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,930
You're declining representation?

353
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,830
Yes.

354
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,200
I don't know what happened.

355
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,410
I don't remember, but I didn't kill Isla.

356
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,010
So go ahead.

357
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,520
Ask me whatever you want.

358
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,170
The first time Billy entered rehab

359
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,720
was a month shy of his 14th birthday.

360
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,730
My dad, he--he wanted to help me, fix me.

361
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,190
Rehab, military schools,

363
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,610
religious camps,

364
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,080
some shaman that tried to starve it out of me,

365
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,500
but none of it worked.

366
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,830
Then I met Isla at a meeting.

367
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,410
And unfortunately, Isla didn't have

368
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,610
the money or the father that Billy had.

369
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,990
No rehab--just possession charges, shelters.

370
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,830
She was totally alone in all this.

372
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,960
Isla quit going to meetings.

373
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,620
You know, she thought she was good.

374
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,320
For some reason, she thought I was good too.

375
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,820
That we could do it together.

376
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,300
Just her and I.

377
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,400
We tried.

378
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,400
And it worked.

379
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,610
- So you were sober until-- - Last night.

380
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,930
We had a year.

381
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,340
It's hard to confirm sobriety,

382
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,600
but it does look like Isla's life changed.

384
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,610
So this is her before.

385
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,520
She seems to have a pretty small circle of friends.

387
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,060
Most of her posts are about drugs and parties.

388
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,900
And then, right around the time that Billy says they met,

389
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,320
a new set of friends, lots of photos.

391
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,530
She looks happy.

392
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,700
Also around that time, she opens a bank account.

393
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,520
Gets a job, the apartment.

394
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,400
I think they really did change each other.

395
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,720
Now take me through it one more time.

396
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,140
- Last night... - Isla texted me.

397
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,460
She said she was bad.

398
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,330
That's all. I knew what she meant.

399
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,190
It's what we would do if we felt like we were coming apart,

400
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,720
itching to use.

401
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,470
We'd talk each other off the ledge.

402
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,100
She asked you over?

403
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,570
All right, so we're still running towers,

404
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:39,170
but it looks like Isla texted Billy at 6:45.

405
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,970
He called her back two minutes later.

406
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,660
- Arrived at her place at 8:00. - And they were alone?

407
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,630
According to Billy, nobody else in the apartment.

408
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,850
Just Isla and the drugs.

409
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,630
She already had the heroin on her?

410
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,310
Yeah, she had a black duffel bag.

411
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,030
Dope was already out of it.

412
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,540
Then we used.

413
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,230
We drank.

414
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,140
A year of sobriety gone in a second.

415
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,320
And then, I can't really remember it all from there.

416
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,530
I know we were together in the kitchen.

417
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,620
Okay.

418
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,200
And then, I was in the bedroom.

419
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,390
I woke up to voices.

420
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,710
Someone was mad at her. A man.

421
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,140
- I could see someone there. - Okay, what were they saying?

422
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,700
I don't know. I just...

423
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,620
I woke up again.

424
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,080
She was on the ground, wet and bloody.

425
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,890
I-I tried to help her.

426
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,760
I think I pulled the knife out.

427
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,180
Once he's high, we can't confirm any of it.

428
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,000
There's no black duffel bag at the scene.

429
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,220
No reports from neighbors hearing any arguing,

430
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,030
no signs of forced entry.

431
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,420
Right, so what about the knife?

432
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,520
If he pulled it, Forensics should be able to confirm it.

433
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,160
No, we're dead there.

434
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,870
Forensics ruled the knife inconclusive.

435
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,490
Blood and prints were contaminated.

436
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,870
So what else we got?

437
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,440
Not much.

438
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,560
We can't confirm anyone was inside the apartment besides Billy.

439
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,120
Here's an odd thing, I ran Isla's cell phone.

440
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,880
Everything matches with Billy's story,

441
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,140
except for when she texted him to tell him she felt bad,

442
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,750
she was all the way out in Lake Forest.

443
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,690
Lake Forest? She has connections out there?

444
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,110
Billy never mentioned anything,

445
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,350
but the phone tagged her location.

446
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,480
- She was definitely there. - All right.

447
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,070
Good. Let's run with that.

448
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,210
Go. Come on.

449
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,300
I'm so sorry. Nobody was here.

450
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,520
I don't even know anybody named Isla.

451
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,480
Okay.

452
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,050
Well, have you seen any cars in the area since yesterday?

453
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,150
- Anything unusual? - No.

454
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,500
This place is pretty much the definition of ordinary.

455
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,490
I'm sorry.

456
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,750
What's with this hidden camera here?

457
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,290
It's probably just a kid's toy, or--

458
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,740
No.

459
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,130
- It's a hidden security system. - I just rent the property.

460
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,170
Hadley, you're gonna stay down here with me.

461
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,120
Come on.

462
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,620
You smell that?

463
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,290
Acetone.

464
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,440
What you got?

465
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,840
Clear.

466
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,010
5021I
5021 Ida,

467
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,120
I got a confirmation on my narcotics call.

468
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,910
Gonna need backup and Forensics

469
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,400
- to 163 North Sheridan. - Copy that...

470
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,970
About a million dollars worth.

471
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,460
I'd say.

472
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,380
Jordan?

473
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,340
Jordan.

474
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,760
Jordan, why are you calling me from the landline?

475
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,110
What?

476
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,760
Our security alarm just went off.

477
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,180
- All right, well, go. - Are you sure?

478
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Jordan, I'm on my way.

479
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,690
Jordan, where you at?

480
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,000
They said it's probably tripped.

481
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,410
- Let me see your phone. - What, why?

482
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,300
You said that it was burning hot

483
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,880
and that the battery was dying, right?

484
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,280
They bugged you.

485
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:01,510
Bugged?

486
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,110
There's static on this line too.

487
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,700
They bugged both phones.

488
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,910
- Who bugged us? - Shh.

489
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,080
What?

490
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,060
The cops.

491
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,180
- Give me your phone. - What?

492
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,000
- They ain't bugging me, man. - Give me your phone.

493
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,020
They ain't bugging me. Okay, okay.

494
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,030
All right, all right, all right.

495
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,200
- Stop, man, stop. - Sorry, Jordan, but they were in here.

496
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,400
They've been playing with me all day.

497
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,480
I know what's going on-- know what's going on...

498
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,730
Kev, security said this happens all the time.

499
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,840
I know exactly what's going on. They're cops.

500
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,700
You don't think I know what they're doing?

501
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,240
Kev, Kev!

502
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:41,920
They were in here. They were in here.

503
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,310
I know what they do. I know what's going on.

504
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,370
I know what they do.

505
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,450
- What's up? - Look,

506
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,700
they accessed the side window.

507
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,550
And I don't have a direct image,

508
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,790
but I do have a partial on this black SUV.

509
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,520
Can't tell whether this is a cop car or not,

510
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,540
and I can't make out this guy's face.

511
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,750
Well, we could add more cameras.

512
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,300
Man, they gotta be feeding this to IAD,

513
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,640
trying to find some dirt.

514
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,180
They're working every angle, ain't they?

515
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,610
Hey, Kev, maybe...

516
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,040
we need to find a way out of this thing now.

517
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,870
What you mean?

518
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,350
Nolan and McKenzie are third generation police.

519
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,810
I mean, there's gotta be some sort of deal that they'd take.

520
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,450
- Oh, and you talked to Voight? - No.

521
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,350
Your dad?

522
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,150
My dad? What the hell would I talk to my dad for?

523
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,470
Third generation. Ain't this what y'all do?

524
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,390
Kev, they are coming after you, okay?

525
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,610
If there's something that we can give them--

526
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,900
Huh, give them? I'm not giving them anything.

527
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,230
I did nothing wrong.

528
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,270
I told the truth. They jumped me.

529
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,720
Four against one. Kicked my head in.

530
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,420
Then broke into my house, where I live, where my family lives.

531
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,730
We still got a case. Still got a clock.

532
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,630
- Get anything on Hadley? - No.

533
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,260
She claims she's never been in the basement before,

534
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,310
doesn't even have a key.

535
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,310
It's all a lie, of course.

536
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,110
She knows exactly who the drugs belong to.

537
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,230
She lawyered up.

538
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,390
Bag house is on bad paper.

539
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,980
The owner registered it to a bogus LLC.

540
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,730
All right, so me and Kev are gonna run all that past Billy.

541
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,800
Meantime, you get Hadley into holding.

542
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,300
Who is she?

543
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,730
I don't know, okay?

544
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,180
I don't know this woman.

545
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,670
I've never seen her!

546
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,840
I-I told you everything I can remember.

547
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,530
You're telling me you can't prove it.

548
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,490
Did Isla ever mention a Hadley?

549
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,300
Ever tell you where she scored her drugs?

550
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,870
I've told you everything I can remember.

551
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,350
- I can't-- - Hey, Billy.

552
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,840
Billy, I know you're feeling the pressure right now.

553
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,070
All right, because we are running out of time--

554
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,670
You think I don't wanna remember?

555
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,490
Okay, well, just calm down.

556
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,540
Okay, you can take this. You can handle it.

557
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,960
My body feels terrible.

558
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,510
I-I feel like I'm losing my mind.

559
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,800
I know, but this is where you fight, okay?

560
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,540
This is where you fight, okay?

561
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,880
Okay? All right, all right, all right.

562
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,340
Now, you don't know Hadley. That's fine.

563
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,850
What about the drugs?

564
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,560
What about the heroin?

565
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,510
- The tag. - Okay.

566
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,920
- The tag. - The insignia?

567
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,180
- Yeah. - Okay, what about it?

568
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,970
Yeah.

569
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,360
These bags of dope, they were in the black bag.

570
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,910
She had a lot of them.

571
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,010
Wait, you're saying that she had

572
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,710
more than just a few grams?

573
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,300
Yeah, the black bag was full of these bags.

574
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,860
Guys, I made a connection. Check this out.

575
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,850
This is Tim Rollins. He's 36 years old.

576
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:04,600
He's got a history of violence, two priors for drug possession

577
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,440
with intent to distribute in Indiana.

578
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,090
Now, Hadley has calls, Venmo requests,

579
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,570
and social media hits with this guy.

580
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:11,930
So does Isla.

581
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,650
And her social media is loaded with pictures

582
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,860
of the two of them right up until when she met Billy.

583
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,350
Ex-boyfriend. The drugs are definitely his.

584
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,740
Isla knew it. She was itching.

585
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,610
She went back. She stole the drugs.

586
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,230
Bring him in.

587
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,900
Blue Sedan.

588
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,670
It's been cleaned. Bleach.

589
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,500
Jay, Hailey.

590
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,170
We dropped an anchor on Tim's place.

591
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,240
We got a blue Sedan freshly scrubbed down.

592
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,610
It's the exact match to the car

593
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,180
idling outside Isla's apartment.

594
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,840
Copy that. We're nine minutes out.

595
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,570
We'll hold anchor until you arrive.

596
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,350
Tim Rollins.

597
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,820
Stop!

598
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,860
Chicago PD!

599
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,390
- I'ma go around the back! - Copy.

600
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,210
5021 Ida in foot pursuit. Westbound alley towards Bell.

601
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,270
Offender is male, white. 6'2" in blue jeans.

602
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
I need patrol cars off Bell and Waveland.

603
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,970
I need containment right now.

604
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,300
Copy that, 5021 Ida.

605
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,060
We will send units in your area.

606
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,870
5021 Ida, I need an ETA on that backup!

607
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,080
- Watch out! - 5021 Ida,

608
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,500
units not responding.

609
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,000
Do I have containment or not? Where is everyone?

610
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,290
Negative. No one in route.

611
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,010
Dispatch, do I have cars coming? Where the hell is my backup?

612
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,390
I lost eyes.

613
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,740
Adam!

614
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,750
Adam!

615
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,790
Adam? 5021, 10-1. 10-1,

616
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,320
shots fired. Officer down.

617
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,470
Roll an ambo to the west alley of Bell.

618
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,390
Where is he? Where is he? Where is he?

619
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,800
He's gone, he's gone.

620
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,480
You--let me get this off.

621
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,160
Ah, I'm good, I'm good.

622
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,570
Shut up. You don't know that.

623
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,490
- It didn't go through. - I know.

624
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,820
Rollins kept going. You should go.

625
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,730
No, no, it hit your rib.

626
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,860
You breathing all right?

627
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,870
I'm fine. The wind's just knocked--

628
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,730
Ruzek, where you at?

629
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,380
It's good, bro. The vest took it.

630
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,470
- What the hell happened? - Hit the ribs.

631
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,900
I shouldn't have taken the corner.

632
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,690
- Patrol never rolled. - He's good.

633
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,030
They're not rolling with me. I'm sorry, bro.

634
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,150
- It's all right. - I'm good.

635
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,340
He's good.

636
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,060
No, you just got shot 'cause of me.

637
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,920
It's not on you, Kev. You're good.

638
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,540
He just got shot. He just got shot.

639
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,540
- Who didn't respond? - Kevin.

640
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,020
I know it's on your radar.

641
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,250
- Who didn't respond to the call? - Kevin, I am looking into it.

642
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,500
I'm going to question every officer--

643
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,550
Who was it?

644
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,340
There were three patrol officers in the area and four tact guys.

645
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,580
Who were the tact guys?

646
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,130
Right now, every one of them has plausible deniability--

647
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,110
Of course they do. Who were the tact guys?

648
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,350
McKenzie was one of them. Kevin, come on.

649
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,200
Kevin, no. Kevin, please...

650
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,270
Really?

651
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,350
This is what we're doing? Letting cops get killed?

652
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,820
- I was making an arrest. - Ruzek got shot.

653
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,970
I couldn't roll on a call. Back the hell up, man!

654
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,590
You feel good, huh?

655
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,750
Coming at good cops 'cause I told the truth?

656
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,890
I'm not coming for you.

657
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,480
You just wanna watch officers bleed out in the dirt--

658
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,710
- I said I ain't coming-- - Yeah, you woke now?

659
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,830
I gave you your answer. Now back up!

660
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,740
I ain't backing no damn where, coward.

661
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,580
You're still protecting your racist ass buddy?

662
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,950
Not here, man.

663
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,240
You take a breath. It's us.

664
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,530
- Take a breath. - He's giving orders.

665
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,930
I'm good.

666
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,810
You think any of us wanna be doing this?

667
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,810
The world of police is burning down.

668
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,370
You think patrol cops wanna be coming for you,

669
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,750
risking their jobs?

670
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,560
He's giving orders.

671
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,830
We got a lead on Rollins. We gotta go.

672
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,850
I know you feel it.

673
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,870
Nolan's still got the department.

674
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,840
You'll never see them, never prove it.

675
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,750
This is how they do it.

676
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,470
They make you scared of your own shadow.

677
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,520
This is how they break you.

678
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,130
We got Rollins entering the Wilson CTA stop

679
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,910
two minutes after your 10-1 call, Ruz,

680
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,660
and then exiting again at Belmont.

681
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,870
Rollins has a cousin that lives two blocks from Belmont.

682
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,330
Great place to hide out.

683
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,630
Hey, Adam.

684
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,730
- You okay? - I'm good.

685
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,970
All right, we are not relying on Patrol this time.

686
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,550
We secure the location

687
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,170
and contain the perimeter ourselves, understood?

688
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,300
- Let's do it. - Let's go.

689
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,550
Come on. Let's go.

690
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,670
- Back's secure. - Copy.

691
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,000
Tim Rollins, Chicago PD. We have a warrant to enter.

692
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,770
I've got movement in the house--go.

693
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,180
Kev, Adam, he's heading your way.

694
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,500
- Stay down! - Stay there!

695
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,370
Yeah, yes, stay down.

696
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,710
Offender in custody.

697
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,210
Confirm, Hailey.

698
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,350
We got you. We got you.

699
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:05,100
- Okay. - All right, let's go.

700
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,950
Let's go. Get him up, get him up.

701
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,930
This the gun you shot my partner with?

702
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:11,380
- Get up. - Get him up.

703
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,160
Let's go.

704
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,830
I'm sorry, bro.

705
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,590
You got no reason to be sorry.

706
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,870
You do know I got you, though, right?

707
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,610
We all do.

708
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:31,980
You're not alone.

709
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,940
Yeah, I'm 10 minutes out.

710
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,950
Hey, if you want me, then come get me.

711
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,050
I could take whatever you got.

712
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,250
Not sure what you're talking about.

713
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,180
Well, come for me, not my unit,

714
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,180
good cops that don't got nothing to do with this.

715
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,110
If I'm the one you want, then come for me!

716
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,670
You know I did the right thing!

717
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,140
"The right thing"?

718
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,770
Is that what you think you did?

719
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,940
You're the hero who crumpled the Blue Wall?

720
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,610
Doyle was a gladiator cop that killed--

721
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,310
Doyle was a dead man!

722
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,430
He was already killed, and then you killed him again.

723
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,370
You left his children with a dead father

724
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,720
they gotta be ashamed of, and for what?

725
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,990
You're standing exactly where you were.

726
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,280
Blue Wall's still all around you.

727
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,230
I'm gonna keep coming for you

728
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,510
in any way I want

729
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,970
until I have your badge.

730
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,150
Evening.

731
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,510
Heard you closed the case.

732
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,860
Congrats.

733
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,300
Really?

734
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,480
It's professional courtesy.

735
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,550
All right, I read it in the management book.

736
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,120
It's supposed to build trust.

737
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,220
Do you like me now?

738
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,250
Look, I know you didn't get me 48 and protection for free.

739
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,310
Can we just cut to the part

740
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,760
where you tell me what you want?

741
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,200
I gave you 48 because you were right.

742
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,010
Look, I get it.

743
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,430
You look at me, and you see everyone that came before me:

744
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,970
Kelton, Woods, Brennan.

745
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:35,810
You know their file is still up at Ivory?

746
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,320
- They hated you. - They didn't hide it.

747
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,580
- I'm not them. - They all said that too.

748
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,360
I'm sure they did, but I'm just here to do a job,

749
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,480
a job that I am very good at.

750
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,740
I'm something new, Hank.

751
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,020
Part of the new world, huh?

752
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,680
Yeah.

753
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,370
Chicago's an old city, Sam.

754
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,350
It is.

755
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,280
You should get that. Go ahead.

756
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,550
Today was fun.

757
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,790
The fight's always the good part.

758
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,930
It's the only way you really see people.

759
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,330
Voight.

760
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,330
It's starting to get cold.

761
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,620
Yeah, I know I got two options.

762
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,070
Let you make some deal for me, or I hand over my badge.

763
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,980
Well, I can't have you in my unit, Kev.

764
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,300
- Not if-- - I know.

765
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,190
Not if I'm jeopardizing cases.

766
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,600
Or I'm risking team's lives. I get it.

767
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,570
So let me help you.

768
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,490
I already talked to Nolan. Listen.

769
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,850
The deal would be I put a beef on your record.

770
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,280
Official complaint.

771
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,310
I mean, it would tie you down.

772
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,030
It means you'd never make detective,

773
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,580
never leave my unit.

774
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,380
It's a brick,

775
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,320
but Nolan would stop coming--

776
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,560
I'm not taking that.

777
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,160
Then you're not gonna be a cop anymore.

778
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,200
Maybe I don't wanna be a cop anymore.

779
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,110
I'm constantly looking over my shoulder.

780
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,780
I'm mad

781
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,120
every hour, every minute, every second.

782
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,880
I'm mad at Nolan, I'm mad at you, I'm mad at Ruzek.

783
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,270
I'm mad at every white cop

784
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
that feels like they can make a deal for me.

785
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,290
And every cop that's done this job the wrong way,

786
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,300
which means I'm mad at myself.

787
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,090
I'm so mad, I don't even think

788
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,250
I can do the job the right way anymore.

789
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,090
Then do it different.

790
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,730
Do it different.

791
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,890
That's the win. You get to do it different.

792
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,710
- And Nolan skates? - Nolan.

793
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,060
Nolan, the way he polices, he's not gonna last another year.

794
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,430
Then what's the point of giving him a damn thing?

795
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,570
Because it's not a new world yet.

796
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,170
It's just not.

797
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,170
So we just wait for the whole world to change

798
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,680
and just pull me up?

799
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,550
What would you do?

800
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,270
Voight?

801
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,520
In my skin, with this world, would you do that?

802
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,980
Me?

803
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
No.

804
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,260
I'd say you are a good cop.

805
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,470
And you're a good man, Kevin.

806
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,470
And you ask me, as soon as you're not one anymore,

807
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,720
they're winning.

808
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,210
Kevin, I...

809
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,270
Listen, I'll back you no matter what you choose.

810
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,110
But the question is, what do you wanna do?

811
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,280
Nobody's home. I already checked.

812
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,060
I wouldn't wanna scare your family.

813
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,880
What the hell do you think you're doing?

814
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,400
I'm a cop too. Nobody saw me come in.

815
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,030
- You're gonna kill me? - No.

816
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,600
I'm gonna tell you our way out.

817
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,380
Well, that's not how this works.

818
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,820
It is if I take the third option...

819
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:33,080
where I give up my badge a different way.

820
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,260
Where I sue you

821
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,370
and I sue the Chicago Police Department...

822
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,060
where I detail the harassment, the intimidation,

823
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,740
the kilo of dope you planted in my car,

824
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,370
the officers who pulled me over,

825
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,140
the break-in at my house,

826
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,500
the beatdown.

827
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,050
The innocent cop you let get shot,

828
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,870
the fact that you ordered other officers to do your bidding--

829
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,640
You might need some sort of evidence.

830
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,730
Yeah.

831
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,960
But do you really think all those men

832
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,500
are gonna stand by you?

833
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,960
When I rip you limb from limb in front of the media?

834
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,680
When I give up my badge, my job, and my life

835
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,550
to stand on the podium and call you a racist?

836
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:24,180
When every member of my team backs me?

837
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,130
When I march in the streets with your face on my poster?

838
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,870
When I come for your job, your pension,

839
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,330
your house, your name?

840
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,240
All while you're still living?

841
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,850
While your three sons watch?

842
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,140
I don't wanna give up this job,

843
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,450
but if you keep coming after me,

844
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,930
any member of my unit, or any other cop,

845
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,790
I promise you

846
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,670
I will give it all away.

847
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,510
I will make it my job to come after you.

848
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,310
And I will destroy you.

849
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,110
Pass the ball, bro. Pass it.
