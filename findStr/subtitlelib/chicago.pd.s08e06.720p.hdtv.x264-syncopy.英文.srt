1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,990
Oh, I can't believe you eat that crap.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm hungry.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,990
It's not like there's a lot of options around.

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,810
You know you got a little...

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,850
Do not.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,200
Jay,

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,530
it's legit been six hours now.

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,870
How reliable is this CI of yours?

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,450
Very. he said this is gonna happen,

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,660
it's gonna happen.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,000
All right. If you say so.

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,590
Look--I know this sucks,

13
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,480
but we've had 34 heroin ODs

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,210
in the past week on the South Side.

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,920
I'm guessing 30 of those can be tied to Dante's crew.

16
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,530
There.

17
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,430
Got a dark Impala.

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,460
And we got Texas plates.

19
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,140
All right. We got eyes.

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,610
All right. This must be it.

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,380
My CI said one of Dante's guys is gonna park a car

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,420
on Calumet and 87th.

23
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,240
He's gonna walk away.

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,680
Then another associate is gonna pick up the car.

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,030
He's gonna drive off.

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,020
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,940
Yeah, we got a guy out here videotaping the driver.

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,440
Is this our guy?

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,580
It's gotta be.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,980
Let's go.

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,470
All right. Move out.

32
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,400
All right. Let's take him.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,510
Burgess, you hold down the front.

34
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,100
The rest of us will go around back.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,630
It's open.

36
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,570
Go.

37
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,730
Chicago PD. Do not move.

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,250
Turn back around. Turn back around.

39
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,390
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

40
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,960
Relax--look-I know what it looks like.

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,100
- Anybody else inside? - No, it's only me.

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,440
But I'm trying to tell you it's not what you think.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
I'd say it's exactly what we think.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
It's heroin.

45
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,060
You're not getting it. I'm working a case.

46
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,610
It's a murder case.

47
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,060
Victim's name is Sean Wade.

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,500
Check with Area Four Homicide.

49
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,870
Are you saying you're a cop?

50
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,000
No.

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,980
I'm saying I'm Sean's father.

52
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,410
I'm just trying to find out who killed my son.

54
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,570
My son was shot and killed

55
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,480
at the corner of 85th and Wabash on July 5th.

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,580
He was 17.

57
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,150
And nothing's been done about it.

58
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,220
That's a rough neighborhood. Do you live over there?

59
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,490
No.

60
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,210
We live in Calumet Heights.

61
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,610
And I know what you're thinking.

62
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,630
My son wasn't in any gang. He was a good kid.

63
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,030
Okay. Is that what the police think too?

64
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,180
The police?

65
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,330
The police don't think anything.

66
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,080
They never did a damn thing about it.

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,120
Okay, I doubt that. Come on.

68
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,050
No, no, no. Don't tell me.

69
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,930
Black kid lying dead in the street.

70
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,980
Step over him. Move on.

71
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,670
All the same to them.

72
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,420
I understand that's how you feel.

73
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,760
But right now, I'm having a hard time

74
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,680
connecting your son being killed

75
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,460
to you running dope for Dante Rashard

76
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,250
who's the biggest heroin dealer on the South Side.

77
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,760
Man, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,940
I'm just playing along with these gangbangers

79
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,320
so I can find out who murdered Sean.

80
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,890
How do you even know

81
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,960
that someone in that gang killed your son?

82
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,550
Because I did what the police didn't.

83
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,000
I investigated.

84
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,090
I looked into the murder myself.

85
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,350
And everyone I talked to in that neighborhood

86
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,700
said the Prophets were responsible.

87
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,680
You need more than that. That's not a lot to go on.

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,500
Two people saw a silver car racing down Wabash

89
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,120
right after Sean got shot.

90
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,910
So that's what I'm looking for.

91
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,240
A silver car.

92
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,610
Now if I get in deep enough with these Prophets,

93
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,560
I'ma find out who drives that car,

94
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,290
and when I do,

95
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,170
I'ma know that's the son of a bitch who killed Sean.

96
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,360
How did you even start working with these guys?

97
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,690
I heard about this young brother named K-Mac.

98
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,730
Found out he rolls with the Prophets,

99
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,910
moves a lot of dope.

100
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,720
So I found out how to meet him.

101
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,710
Told him I knew how to drive gas tanks, build traps...

102
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,410
a week later, he calls, asks for my help.

103
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,610
So you're really doing all this

104
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,140
just to find your son's killer?

105
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,580
He was my son,

106
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,220
my flesh and blood.

107
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,160
And some punk shot him

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,010
and left him to die in the street like an animal.

109
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,860
So yeah.

110
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,360
I'ma do whatever I have to do to find the killer.

111
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,120
My son still talks to me

112
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,480
every night.

113
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,620
Shows up at my bedside.

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,090
Just stands there,

115
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,520
all soaking wet like the day he died.

116
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,670
Says, "Don't let me die in vain, Pop.

117
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,570
Don't let me die in vain."

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,310
And I won't.

119
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,230
You buy this?

120
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,680
Sounds credible to me.

121
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,870
Okay.

122
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,940
So let's dig into his story.

123
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,330
If it's legit, we use him to take down Dante.

124
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,760
Look who's slumming.

125
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,830
How you doing, buddy?

126
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,380
Hailey Upton--Gil Durham.

127
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,760
Soon-to-be Sergeant Durham, if my intel serves me.

128
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,340
- Congratulations. - Thank you very much.

129
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,080
Look, we'd love to stay and stroke your ego,

130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,720
but we have actual jobs.

131
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,570
Ouch. Here you go.

132
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,710
Sean Wade.

133
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,210
What can you tell us about the case?

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,420
Not much.

135
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:26,540
Kid's been in the gang database since he was 14.

136
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,180
Took three to the chest from a 9-millimeter.

137
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,790
Most likely gang dispute that escalated.

138
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,530
Is this all you got?

139
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,220
You got one witness statement in here?

140
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,800
We were lucky to get that.

141
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,210
You know how it is.

142
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,620
We were barely on the scene, another call came in.

143
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,270
Had seven murders that weekend.

144
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,390
Yeah. Totally get it.

145
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,860
Well, I'm not sure if the victim's father gets it.

146
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,180
So he's pulled Intelligence into this now.

147
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,330
How'd he manage that?

148
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,840
We crossed paths on a drug case.

149
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,290
He told us that he's dropping gas tanks

150
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,130
for the Gangster Prophets

151
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,090
as a way to find the guy that killed his kid.

152
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,020
We're just trying to vet his story,

153
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,190
see if he's credible.

154
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,530
He says he come to you with some evidence.

155
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,480
I wouldn't exactly call it evidence.

156
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,260
He called me 30 times about some car.

157
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,330
That's what he does.

158
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,370
He walks the streets all night looking for a silver car.

159
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,510
Yeah, man. He seems really determined.

160
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,030
I can't say that I blame him.

161
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,370
I feel bad for the man.

162
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,660
But we did what we could--

163
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,970
exhausted all credible leads.

164
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,590
All right. Thanks, Gil.

165
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,670
How you doing, Latrell? I'm Sergeant Voight.

166
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,920
I want you to know we looked into your son's case

167
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,510
over at Homicide.

168
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,440
So you believe me?

169
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,560
You're gonna help?

170
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,570
Well, I believe your son was killed,

171
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,480
and you're trying to figure out who did the murder.

172
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,130
Yeah. I believe that.

173
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,340
Latrell, the fact is...

174
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,210
you committed a crime, a felony.

175
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,240
Wait. I ain't no drug dealer.

176
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,140
Yeah, but we caught you unloading ten kilos of heroin.

177
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,920
That's class X weight. That's 10 to 15 years.

178
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,450
Good news is you don't have to do a day.

179
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,880
What's he talking about?

180
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
We want you to work with us as a cooperating defendant.

181
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,710
- A defendant? - Yeah.

182
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,720
You help us take down Dante Rashard's heroin operation,

183
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,670
we'll wipe your record clean.

184
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,020
No.

185
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,380
I don't care about any of that.

186
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,490
I'm just trying to find the bastard who killed my son.

187
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,600
You don't care?

188
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,190
That's somebody's son.

189
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,420
Take a look at that.

190
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,360
Take a look.

191
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,250
That's what heroin laced with fentanyl does.

192
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,650
Kay?

193
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,380
And like it or not, you are part of the process

194
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,720
because you're helping Dante flood the streets

195
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,660
with this poison.

196
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,750
I was just trying to get information.

197
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,600
Latrell, you are not a cop. Okay?

198
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,190
You don't get to go undercover.

199
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,010
Latrell,

200
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,800
if this gang really is responsible for Sean's death,

201
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,540
then you should wanna cooperate with us.

202
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,260
Help us put them in prison.

203
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,310
You do that--you help us with this drug case--

204
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,320
I'm telling you there's a good chance

205
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,500
we're gonna find out who killed Sean too.

206
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,200
Look--it's your call.

207
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,210
But you gotta make a decision now.

208
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,970
Fine.

209
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,980
I'll help. I'm in.

210
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,410
This is K-Mac.

211
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,460
We got eyes.

212
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,500
You guys seeing this silver Lexus?

213
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,340
Yeah, we see it. Just sit tight.

214
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,020
Jay, you got a silver Lexus on your six.

215
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,270
What's up?

216
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,970
What up, Latrell? This here your boy?

217
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,620
Yeah, his name's Jay. He's cool.

218
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,610
What's up, man?

219
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,450
How much you looking to score?

220
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,510
One ki to start,

221
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,520
and if it's as good as I hear, I'll do more.

222
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,120
Okay. All right.

223
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,150
We might be able to work something out.

224
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,780
Okay.

225
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,380
Who this?

226
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,400
Dante. Told him we were meeting up.

227
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,270
He wanted to talk with you first.

228
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,050
Since when do garage men start making deals?

229
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,540
I don't mean to be overstepping.

230
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,940
I just knew my man here was looking to up his supplies,

231
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,880
so I figured I'd make the introduction.

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,490
Oh, this white boy your friend?

233
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,050
Yeah. We've been friends for years.

234
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,070
- He's a good dude. - How you two meet?

235
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,850
- At his garage. - Ain't nobody talking to you.

236
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,850
I was talking to him.

237
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,090
Latrell.

238
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,820
At my garage about five years ago.

239
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,490
He got into an accident. I fixed his car.

240
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,040
We became friends.

241
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,380
Then he asked if I could install traps--trap tanks.

242
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,340
How much you shopping for?

243
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,010
One brick.

244
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,820
But things go well, I could do, like,

245
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,720
three--maybe even four a month.

246
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,550
What you staring at, old man?

247
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,880
I'm just checking out your ride.

248
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,460
You don't see many silver Lexus.

249
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,870
How long you been pushing that?

250
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,810
Excuse me?

251
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,450
- Just curious. - Why?

252
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,700
No reason.

253
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,600
I'm starting to get nervous about Latrell.

254
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
He keeps talking about a silver car.

255
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,160
Let it play.

256
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,760
Latrell, why are you talking about the man's car?

257
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,670
We're here to do a deal. Come on.

258
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,300
I know why we're here, bro.

259
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm just admiring the man's whip.

260
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,280
So we gon' do a deal or what?

261
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,580
I'm not liking your tone right here, old man.

262
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,980
Don't call me old man.

263
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,270
First time I let it slide.

264
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,370
That's it. No more.

265
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,220
Who the hell you talking to, bruh?

266
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,260
You.

267
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,450
Whoa. All right.

268
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,620
Yo. I'm just here to buy some H.

269
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,430
Ain't nobody got no H. Understand me?

270
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,130
Yeah. You know what?

271
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,170
You're right. I misspoke.

272
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,490
So I think we're gonna get out of here.

273
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,520
Come on, Latrell.

274
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,170
Nah, we came here to do a deal.

275
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,500
Nah, we're good, man. This is a misunderstanding.

276
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,870
So let's go.

277
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,740
I see you again...

278
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,660
you a dead man.

279
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,250
What are you doing? What are you doing?

280
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,980
You trying to get us killed?

281
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,710
Let's go. Come on.

282
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,070
Let's go. You need to calm down.

283
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,330
You're gonna get us killed.

284
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,500
That man killed my son. I know it.

285
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,300
No, we don't know that.

286
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,330
There's nothing we can do about it right now.

287
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,920
He killed my son. He killed my--

288
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,710
Stop! Keep walking, Latrell.

289
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,350
- Stop, stop, stop. - He killed my son, man!

290
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,290
- Hey--let it go. - Get off me.

291
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,860
Let it go! Let it go.

292
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,210
Let it go.

293
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,080
- Sarge? - Yeah.

294
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,840
I ran the plate and the VIN on the Lexus.

295
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,400
The car definitely belonged to Dante

296
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,900
at the time of Sean's murder.

297
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,700
He paid for it in cash back in April.

298
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,290
What are you doing, Jay?

299
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,310
Look, just hear me out.

300
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,490
Gang intel says that Dante

301
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,930
is a major player with the Prophets.

302
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:23,630
Before he started focusing on heroin,

303
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,090
he was an enforcer down in Englewood.

304
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,450
He's a person of interest in three unsolved shootings.

305
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,850
Yeah, well, last I checked,

306
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,310
solving old murders is Homicide's job.

307
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,640
Okay. But this guy is flooding the market with poison,

308
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,220
and he's killing people every day.

309
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,520
So if we can't get him on the heroin,

310
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,080
let's go after him for Sean's murder.

311
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,270
We'll get him and the heroin off the street that way.

312
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,460
Why are you doing this, Jay?

313
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,760
Because that guy is hurting,

314
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,160
and he just needs answers

315
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,200
so he can move on with his life.

316
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,500
And we can all relate to that.

317
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,050
Okay. Let's build a case.

318
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,970
See if we can tie Dante to Sean's murder.

319
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,000
Always loved that picture.

320
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,770
You know--

321
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,230
Sean was more thinker than tinker,

322
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,530
but he'd help me out in the shop anyway.

323
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,810
He wasn't very good, but I loved having him around.

324
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,940
Look, Latrell, if we're gonna find out what happened,

325
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,270
then we need to know the truth about Sean.

326
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,120
I've been telling you the truth about Sean.

327
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,010
CPD thinks that Sean got mixed up with Dante,

328
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,930
and that probably led to his death.

329
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,330
It's not possible.

330
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,420
Look--Sean was a good boy.

331
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,160
And I made damn sure of it.

332
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,370
I pushed him hard. I wanted him to be successful.

333
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,080
And he was on his way.

334
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,370
Sean was gonna do great things.

335
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,370
I hear all of that.

336
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,410
But he was a registered gang member.

337
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,180
He'd been in the database since he was in junior high.

338
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,130
And who do you think painted him with that?

339
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,000
Your people did. Why?

340
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,390
'Cause he was out hanging with his friends,

341
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,770
got thrown on the damn hood?

342
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,650
Your people tattooed him with that.

343
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,570
All right. Let's say he was targeted my mistake like you're saying.

344
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,460
Then something put a target on his back.

345
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,800
So was he friends with someone in that gang?

346
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,570
Not that I know of.

347
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,820
Well, what was he doing in Englewood that night?

348
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,360
He said he was going to the library.

349
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,560
Okay. What about money?

350
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,370
Did he owe somebody money? Did he piss anyone off?

351
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,870
Look--we're not here to judge. We're trying to help.

352
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,150
So if you know something...

353
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,460
There was some money.

354
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,130
I was cleaning up around his bed one night,

355
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,150
and I found some stuffed in an envelope.

356
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,750
How much is some?

357
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,720
About $2,000.

358
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,930
Smaller bills?

359
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,260
Any idea where he got that kind of cash?

360
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,080
I thought maybe he was just gambling

361
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,560
with his friends or something. You know, fantasy. All that.

362
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Latrell,

363
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,780
is it possible your son was dealing drugs,

364
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,760
and you didn't know?

365
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
No.

366
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,840
We pinged Dante's cell the night of Sean's murder.

367
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,250
And the phone went dark from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.

368
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,470
That's something a pro would do.

369
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,010
Okay. So what about Sean?

370
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,490
Do we know anything about his movements?

371
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,800
Whatever he was doing there, he wasn't just passing through.

372
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,050
His phone puts him in Englewood

373
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,770
for five hours before he was killed.

374
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,650
And it wasn't the first time he camped out there.

375
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,920
Dumped his cell records,

376
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,180
and the three months before his death,

377
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,340
he was at that corner at least twice a week.

378
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,970
That would explain the 2 grand in his bedroom.

379
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,560
So with the extra cash Sean was bringing in

380
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,740
and the cell phone evidence,

381
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,990
it looks like he was working with Dante's crew.

382
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,120
And it's either that

383
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,080
or he's working that corner without affiliation.

384
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,580
Which is a guarantee to catch three in the chest.

385
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,700
Yeah, well, it's all still speculation. We gotta know for sure.

386
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,050
We got any idea who's running that area for Dante now?

387
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,250
Actually, you know what? We do.

388
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,920
- It's this cat right here. - Okay.

389
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,370
Travis Laroc, 18, in and out of the system.

390
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,560
Documented and self-admitted member of the Prophets.

391
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,710
He's been in Dante's crew for about three years now.

392
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,320
All right.

393
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,160
Go talk to him. See what he knows.

394
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,540
Thanks.

395
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,950
Did you lose something?

396
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,110
- Stop. Turn around. - Come on, man.

397
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,180
Y'all love harassing somebody, bro.

398
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,240
- Come on, man. - Just chill out. Chill out.

399
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,450
We just wanna talk to you.

400
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,130
Put your arms out.

401
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,650
What's that?

402
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,500
That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.

403
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,950
Don't you know this is a dangerous neighborhood?

404
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,460
All right, put your arms down; tell you what.

405
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,150
We're gonna ignore the dope you got over there.

406
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,200
We're even gonna give you that money back.

407
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,700
You just gotta answer a few questions.

408
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,740
Did Sean Wade work this corner before you?

409
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,320
I don't work no corner.

410
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,830
And I don't know no Sean Wade.

411
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,020
Okay. In two seconds, I'm going under the stairs,

412
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,760
and I'm getting the dope you've been working, you hear me?

413
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,340
And your prints are gonna be all over it.

414
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,560
I'm telling y'all.

415
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,450
I don't know nobody named Sean Wade.

416
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,110
All right, look. That's Sean.

417
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,050
You're telling me you've never seen this kid before?

418
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,630
This is Sean?

419
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,370
I've seen him around.

420
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,900
But he don't work with us.

421
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,740
He ain't no banger.

422
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,920
That's the market boy.

423
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,640
He worked here for a few months.

424
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,310
Part-time, you know, because he was in school.

425
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,080
Nice boy. Smart.

426
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,860
Wanted to go to DePaul.

427
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,560
Do you guys get paid in cash sometimes under the table?

428
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,550
Yeah. We get cash.

429
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,820
Every two weeks.

430
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,400
Sean told me he was saving up

431
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,810
to surprise his daddy with an air conditioner.

432
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,240
Said he worked in the hot garage all day,

433
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,050
wanted him to have a cool house to come home to after work.

434
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,900
Is there anything else you remember

435
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,570
from that night that could help us?

436
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,710
All I remember is Sean running after Erika

437
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,930
so she didn't get rained on.

438
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,630
- Who's Erika? - Erika Moore.

439
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,150
She works here sometimes.

440
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,570
Do you have her contact info?

441
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,080
I can get it for you.

442
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,150
So Sean went outside to make sure Erika didn't get wet?

443
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:56,860
Yeah.

444
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,930
It was coming down real heavy that night.

445
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,850
I told the kids I'd lock up.

446
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,230
Sean hurried to catch Erika

447
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,110
so he could cover her with an umbrella.

448
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,260
I think he had a crush on her.

449
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,260
But she was dating somebody else from the neighborhood.

450
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,280
You know his name?

451
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,900
No. But...

452
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,690
he was in a gang, that's for sure.

453
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,690
Always had lots of cash, lots of jewelry.

454
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,330
I stay away from all that.

455
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,530
Mind my own damn business.

456
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,500
I told the police all this months ago.

457
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,000
You did? When was this?

458
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,220
Night of the murder.

459
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,420
Patrol officer wrote down my name

460
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,480
and said a detective from Homicide would call me.

461
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,790
Did someone ever call?

462
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,670
No.

463
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,840
Twice in one week.

464
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,220
Can I show you something?

465
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,500
- You see that? - Yeah. It's an umbrella. So?

466
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,250
Yeah, it's 20 feet from Sean's dead body.

467
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,810
He gave it to a girl named Erika Moore

468
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,680
the night that he was killed

469
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,210
which means she was with him when it happened.

470
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,720
Which means that she's a witness to it,

471
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,870
and you never chased it.

472
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,840
Slow down.

473
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,860
Just tell me what the hell you're talking about.

474
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,220
Sean worked at a market a block from the scene.

475
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,210
Woman there says that Sean was worried about Erika getting wet.

476
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,660
And so he ran outside to bring her an umbrella.

477
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,460
The woman's name is right here in the file, Gil.

478
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,690
It's Florence Clay.

479
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,520
Patrol passed it on. You sat on it.

480
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,660
- Oh, come on, Jay. - You never followed up.

481
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,510
Back off.

482
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,860
I'm busting my ass out there every day.

483
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,310
I've got a file cabinet full of cases just like that one.

484
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,580
Every one of them a gang shooting.

485
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,800
And every one of them has a grieving mother or father

486
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,220
hounding me for answers.

487
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,860
Talking about one phone call, Gil. That's it.

488
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,820
I should have called!

489
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,760
I get it.

490
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,000
But these gang cases get low priority.

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,860
After a week or so, we move on.

492
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,260
We don't chase rainbows.

493
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,990
We chase cases we can actually solve.

494
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,660
What the bosses want. Just the way it is.

495
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,050
He was a good kid.

496
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,810
No priors, no affiliations.

497
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,480
It's not just another gang shooting.

498
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,560
Here we go. Quad A.

500
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,380
Can I help you?

501
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,200
Chicago PD. We're looking for Erika Moore.

502
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,160
About what?

503
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,030
- Are you her mother? - Yeah.

504
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,040
Okay, we just wanna ask her a few questions.

505
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,760
- She's not here. - Do you know where she is?

506
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,740
Did that just happen? Did someone hurt you?

507
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,810
No. I'm okay.

508
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,370
Ma'am, can we come in?

509
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,980
Please. I don't want any trouble.

510
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,340
No--guys, no one's here.

511
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,030
- Going up. - No one is here.

512
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,910
Why aren't you listening to me?

513
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,480
Clear.

514
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,780
Yeah. It's clear down here too.

515
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,230
Ma'am, tell us what's going on.

516
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,850
Someone came over here looking for Erika.

517
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,000
I said she was gone, and he...

518
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,450
he got upset.

519
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,850
Do you know this person's name?

520
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,670
No.

521
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,850
Never seen him before.

522
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,290
Ma'am, please just give us his name.

523
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:58,370
I said I've never seen him before.

524
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,260
Okay.

525
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,570
What about Erika? When was the last time you saw her?

526
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,460
Last night.

527
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,120
She said she was gonna be staying with a friend for a few days.

528
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,180
Okay. Who's this friend?

529
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,380
Where is she staying?

530
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,700
Don't know.

531
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,640
Last question.

532
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,580
Is this the guy who was just here?

533
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,680
I told you I don't want any trouble.

534
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,960
Just--please.

535
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,750
Get your hands out of your pockets.

536
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,690
All right. Relax.

537
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,170
We're just here to talk...

538
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,270
to Dante.

539
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,900
All right. Psh.

540
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,500
What's this about?

541
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,810
Young lady named Erika Moore.

542
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,500
I don't know nobody by that name.

543
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,790
Really?

544
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,230
What the hell this all about, bro?

545
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,010
- Kid named Sean Wade. - Never heard of him.

546
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,600
You know, you kill someone,

547
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,710
you should have the courtesy to know their name.

548
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,880
Kill somebody?

549
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,280
I ain't killed nobody. Kay.

550
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,340
Let me refresh your memory.

551
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,140
Seven months ago,

552
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,730
July 5th, rainy night,

553
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,980
on your corner, 85th and Wabash,

554
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,330
you walked out of your Lexus

555
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,620
and put three bullets in his chest.

556
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,010
July 5th, huh?

557
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,890
I was in Milwaukee that week.

558
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,640
With my cousin.

559
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,860
Celebrating our independence.

560
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,190
How's that? Good enough?

561
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,390
Guess we'll have to wait and see, huh?

562
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,660
Now there's some good news.

563
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,060
Our people just found Erika Moore.

564
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,850
They're bringing her in right now.

565
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,030
Why don't you start checking into his Milwaukee story?

566
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,240
Hi, Erika.

567
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,250
Doing okay? Can we get you anything?

568
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,310
I'm fine.

569
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,810
Okay. So tell us what's been going on.

570
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,750
Why are you hiding out at your cousin's house?

571
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,730
Just needed to get away for a few days.

572
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,610
Does it have anything to do with Sean Wade?

573
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,190
Come on, Erika.

574
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,790
We know you guys worked together and that you were friends,

575
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,740
maybe even a little more than that.

576
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,190
No. We never--

577
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,620
we just worked at the same grocery store. That's all.

578
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,180
But you liked him, right?

579
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,070
Yeah. He was cool.

580
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,710
Okay, good.

581
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,130
So tell us what you saw the night that Sean got shot.

582
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,640
Help us find the person that killed him.

583
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,100
Come on. It was raining.

584
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,960
Sean ran out. He gave you an umbrella.

585
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,310
I heard gunshots,

586
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,360
but I didn't see anything.

587
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,340
You didn't see a silver Lexus pull up?

588
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,110
You didn't see Dante Rashard hop out,

589
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,630
walk up to Sean, and shoot him?

590
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,600
No, I didn't.

591
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,620
Erika, we can protect you.

592
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,140
It's not just about that.

593
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,850
I'm on probation.

594
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,440
And if the judge hears that I was running around

595
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,610
with gangbangers, then he'll throw me back in jail.

596
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,330
And my mom will get kicked out of Mercy public housing.

597
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,250
We're aware of that, and we can help with that too.

598
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,000
We'll make sure the judge knows.

599
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,070
No. I ain't talking.

600
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,650
- I'm done. - You're done, really?

601
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,680
Erika, Sean Wade died right in front of you.

602
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,440
You gotta help us.

603
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,460
You owe it to Sean's father,

604
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,400
and you owe it to Sean.

605
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,360
He was a good person.

606
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,980
But he's gone.

607
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,420
So I'm not about to ruin my life

608
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,520
or my mom's life just to make the police happy.

609
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,800
So like I said before,

610
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,100
I'm done.

611
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,190
She's scared. She's on probation.

612
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,400
She doesn't wanna get jammed up.

613
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,890
Or get her mom evicted.

614
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,610
I got that. So now what?

615
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,860
We ran Dante's alibi.

616
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,120
Turns out he really was in Milwaukee all week.

617
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,030
- Okay. Well that doesn't mean-- - It does.

618
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,210
We found video of him at a restaurant the time of the murder,

619
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,260
ten minutes after the time of the shooting.

620
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,410
He didn't kill Sean Wade.

622
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,050
Okay, so Dante was out of town in Milwaukee.

623
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,030
Means he didn't pull the trigger.

624
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,010
- So who did and why? - All right.

625
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,890
OCD Tech Lab just finished dumping Erika's phone.

626
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,410
I think we got something.

627
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,300
Found three interesting texts received

628
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,520
the night that Sean was killed.

629
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,030
Starting at 6:41,

630
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,940
"I love you, baby. More than ever."

631
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,440
At 7:55,

632
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,990
"Why you playing me, bitch?"

633
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,380
At 8:13, "Your boy is a dead man."

634
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,830
It's like a five-year relationship played out

635
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,370
- in three short texts. - Yeah.

636
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,120
All of these were sent from a phone

637
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,280
registered to one Kayvon MacLaine.

638
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:54,360
- K-Mac. - Yeah. One of Dante's runners.

639
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,340
So K-Mac's dating Erika, not Dante.

640
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,640
And he's jealous of Sean.

641
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,760
So Dante goes to Milwaukee for the weekend.

642
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,340
K-Mac borrows his Lexus, rolls up on Sean,

643
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,980
and shoots him.

644
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,290
Yeah, well, now all we gotta do is prove it.

645
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,380
Think about it like this.

646
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,050
We know a casing was two feet away from the body

647
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,510
which means at least one of the shots was fired up close.

648
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,170
It's a long shot, but maybe blood got on K-Mac's shoes.

649
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,020
He gets in the car.

650
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,270
I don't care how many times you wash it.

651
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,340
You're gonna find traces.

652
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,320
Ah, it's worth a shot. Seize and impound the vehicle.

653
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,470
Hey, Jay.

654
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,910
Your new best friend is downstairs, wants to talk to you.

655
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,910
- Latrell? - Yeah, I can tell him you're on vacation.

656
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,010
No, it's okay.

657
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,880
Look--I know you're trying to help and all, but, uh...

658
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,900
But what?

659
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,330
We're not paid to be psychologists.

660
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,010
Latrell? What are you doing?

661
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,410
I told you you can't come over here, all right?

662
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,530
- We'd let you know. - I went by his house.

663
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,690
What? Who?

664
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,630
Dante.

665
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,920
He was just hanging out with his boys,

666
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,540
laughing with his friends, not a care in the world.

667
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,700
- It's not Dante. - He doesn't deserve to be laughing.

668
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,390
- You guys need to arrest him. - It's not Dante.

669
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,340
He didn't kill Sean.

670
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,310
You saw the silver car. You saw the Lexus.

671
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,230
He didn't kill him.

672
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,650
He's got an alibi for the night and the time of the murder.

673
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,670
Then who did it? Tell me.

674
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,630
No, I can't do that.

675
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,310
But you know who did it.

676
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,890
Yeah. We do.

677
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,050
Can you at least tell me why they killed him?

678
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,620
Sit down.

679
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,830
Look.

680
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,150
We think that Sean was killed because of a girl,

681
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,950
someone he was working with.

682
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,240
Working with? What the hell are you talking about?

683
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,270
Sean didn't have no job.

684
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,940
I told him to focus on his studies.

685
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,340
He was working part-time at a market in Englewood.

686
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,800
He was getting paid in cash.

687
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,630
That's why you found 2 grand in his desk.

688
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,960
The store manager said he was saving up

689
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,020
to buy you an air conditioning unit.

690
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,080
I know how difficult this is.

691
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,370
But we're close to solving it.

692
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,880
So you just gotta be patient.

693
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,250
Let us do our job.

694
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,380
If you know who did it,

695
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,080
why the hell can't you just arrest this son of a bitch now?

696
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,470
Because we need more evidence.

697
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,460
But we are going to get there.

698
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,660
Promise you.

699
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,180
Okay?

700
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,310
Thanks.

701
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,370
Throughout this whole process, you've been the only cop

702
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,060
that treated me with any kind of respect and dignity.

703
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,600
And I appreciate that.

705
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:32,240
Hell no. Y'all can't just take my car, G.

706
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,720
Tell it to the judge.

707
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,640
No, I know my rights. You need cause.

708
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,960
- It says right there. - Ready to go.

709
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,260
We believe your car was used in the commission of a murder.

710
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,510
Nah, this is harassment.

711
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,320
I told y'all I was in Milwaukee, bro.

712
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,960
Copy, Milwaukee. But your car was here in Chicago, sir.

713
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,240
Come on, G. Really?

714
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,470
I just talked to Forensics.

715
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,740
They found traces of blood on the driver's side carpet.

716
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,420
They're checking it now.

717
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,860
Okay, good. Anything else?

718
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,020
Yeah, about 20 texts between K-Mac and Erika.

719
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,990
Exactly what you'd expect.

720
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,330
Lots of love, lots of anger, lots of threats

721
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,830
mostly directed toward Sean Wade.

722
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,340
Sounds like motive to me.

723
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,710
Find his address. Let's arrest his ass.

724
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,410
5021 emergency.

725
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,220
We got shots fired at 7630 South Princeton.

726
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,470
Yeah, you're good. You're good.

727
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,200
Body!

728
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,440
5021. Squad, be advised.

729
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,600
We got a man down. Roll an ambo.

730
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,640
Copy that.

731
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,490
Clear.

732
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,740
It's K-Mac.

733
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:51,510
- I got a runner! - Move.

734
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,190
Stop! Police!

735
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,540
Stop!

736
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,070
- He's gone. - 5021 squad.

737
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,480
Cancel the ambo. Roll the crime lab.

738
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,100
Copy, 5021.

739
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,310
You get anything?

740
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,850
I gave patrol a description of the car,

741
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,200
told 'em to put out a flash.

742
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,100
- You get a partial? - No, it was too far away.

743
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,560
He was average height, medium build.

744
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,760
I mean, that's all I could make out.

745
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,270
What are we thinking? Dante?

746
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,040
Well, here we are.

747
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,180
Our suspect is now a DOA.

748
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,650
All right, three gunshots, close range.

749
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,480
He's got powder burns on the back of his shirt.

750
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,640
Probably didn't see it coming.

751
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,030
You're thinking revolver.

752
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,520
There's no shell casings around

753
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,450
so it's that or he policed his own brass.

754
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:47,960
Okay.

755
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,970
For now, we're gonna assume Dante is behind it.

756
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,810
He got nervous K-Mac might flip, and he took him out.

757
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,540
We just gotta tie him to it.

758
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,460
So check traffic cams, surveillance video,

759
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,900
anything you can find.

760
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,070
And start tracking Dante's inner circle too.

761
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,610
Good chance one of them could've done the hit as well.

762
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,360
Jay, come here. Check this out.

763
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,990
So this is the hot dog spot on 77th.

764
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,910
Street side cam is messed up,

765
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,400
but here's what we pulled from the parking lot.

766
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,560
It's definitely the main target talking to the victim.

767
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,230
Can you see the dark blue car anywhere?

768
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,280
No, but that look like a friendly conversation to you?

769
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,790
Yeah. I see someone.

770
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,020
That's you and your boy, K-Mac,

771
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:37,370
20 minutes before he got gunned down point blank range.

772
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,530
Like you said, he was my boy. Why would I kill him?

773
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,730
Well, I don't know.

774
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,840
Maybe 'cause you heard we were onto him

775
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,780
for the murder of Sean Wade.

776
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,310
Sean who? Why would I care about that?

777
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:48,910
We figured once K-Mac got pinched

778
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,250
for the murder of Sean Wade, he'll roll on you

779
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,160
for the heroin.

780
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,140
You had to know we were getting close

781
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,770
when we swabbed that Lexus.

782
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,310
I hooked up with K-Mac for some food.

783
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,700
Ain't no law against that.

784
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:02,880
So where'd you go between the time you two ate

785
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,420
and the time K-Mac got killed?

786
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,310
I was at my girl, Lena's house.

787
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,690
We got a son together.

788
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,940
We was reading books.

789
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,920
Playing games.

790
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,770
That's very convenient.

791
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,390
I didn't kill K-Mac.

792
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,080
Check his clothes for GSR.

793
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,480
Dante, you should probably make yourself comfortable.

794
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,140
You're gonna be here a while.

795
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
- Talk to me. - Okay.

796
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,560
So Jay saw the car head down Princeton then turn on 76th.

797
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,930
Now there's nothing right there.

798
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,630
But we were able to get something off

799
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,950
a POD on Shields near the park.

800
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,810
- Jay? - Yeah. That's definitely the car.

801
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,670
I tried pulling up the plate, but it's all grain.

802
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,100
Ran the model through our system.

803
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,930
It's a 2001 to 2004 Camaro.

804
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,470
There's at least 200 in the city, maybe more.

805
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,710
We got any other angles?

806
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,070
We know what direction he's headed?

807
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,950
Okay, so I was able to pull one off a stadium,

808
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,580
but look--it's almost directly overhead.

809
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,490
And while it's a clear shot, it's even less of a chance

810
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,900
of seeing the driver or the plates.

811
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,280
And after this, we lose him completely.

812
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,980
All right. So we do it the old-fashioned way.

813
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,770
Track down every single one of those models

814
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,760
one by one until you get a hit.

815
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,960
We gotta connect Dante to that car.

817
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,410
Find the car?

818
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,150
What's going on?

819
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,340
Latrell killed K-Mac.

820
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,340
What makes you say that?

821
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,410
Saw something in the surveillance video.

822
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,900
The dark blue car had an estimate on it,

823
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,960
like the way mechanics put it in the dash,

824
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,160
and that got me thinking.

825
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,040
Well, you got any actual proof?

826
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,520
It's sitting in his parking lot.

827
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,820
Sarge, the Camaro. I saw it.

828
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,400
How did Latrell know we were onto K-Mac?

829
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,970
That wasn't public information, Jay.

830
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,080
I'm not sure.

831
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,940
You're not sure.

832
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,810
I told Latrell that Sean was killed over a girl,

833
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,110
someone that he was working with

834
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,110
at a grocery store in Englewood.

835
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,620
So Latrell must have gone down there

836
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,310
and found out about Erika,

837
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,510
and then connected her back to K-Mac.

838
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,660
Okay.

839
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,730
Tell me this.

840
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,290
Why are you really here?

841
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,190
Latrell shouldn't even be in this position.

842
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:50,350
If Homicide did their job-- if they found the killer--

843
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,890
It's not a perfect system, Jay.

844
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,190
I know it's not.

845
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,170
But Latrell is a good guy.

846
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,490
He loved his kid.

847
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,300
More than anything.

848
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,200
He just couldn't let it go.

849
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,230
He couldn't find closure.

850
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,130
So he just went and he did what he thought he had to do.

851
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,310
Which is something that I might do.

852
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,020
Something that I'm thinking you might do too.

853
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,360
Jay, you're the only one

854
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,990
who saw that estimate on the dash, so...

855
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,000
It's gotta be your call.

856
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,260
What would you do?

857
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,150
Doesn't matter what I'd do.

858
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,840
We're different people, Jay.

859
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,620
You gotta do what makes sense for you.

860
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,370
But whatever that choice is,

861
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,920
just make sure it's something that you can live with

862
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,200
for the rest of your life.

863
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,670
Hey, man.

864
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,980
Hey. Look who it is.

865
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,850
You got a '69 Coupé de Ville out there.

866
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,110
That is some car.

867
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,160
18 1/2 feet from tip to tail.

868
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,800
- You know your cars? - Little bit.

869
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,910
My dad, he would do some tinkering in the garage.

870
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,380
When I was a kid, you know, I'd help out,

871
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,330
but I didn't know what the hell I was doing.

872
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,530
And he'd say, "You're a mechanical genius."

873
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,050
Well, he sounds like a good man.

874
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,720
It's more complicated than that.

875
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,060
But you remind me of him.

876
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,250
- Is that a fact? - Yeah.

877
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,900
He wasn't much for praise or compliments

878
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,760
but man, he loved his sons.

879
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,100
And he wanted us to succeed

880
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,810
more than anything.

881
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,200
Well,

882
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,030
fathers and sons--

883
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,920
it's a tricky dance.

884
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,860
What'd you do with the gun, Latrell?

885
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,370
Gun?

886
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,360
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

887
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,820
I know what happened, and I know what you did.

888
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,810
I tossed it in the river.

889
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,150
Okay.

890
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:58,930
Good.

891
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,360
All we got is the Camaro fleeing the scene.

892
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,490
So you keep your mouth shut,

893
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,580
and you ask for a lawyer.
