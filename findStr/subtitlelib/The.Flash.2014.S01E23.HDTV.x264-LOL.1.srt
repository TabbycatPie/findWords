1
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:08,776
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:11,946
When I was a child,
I saw my mother killed

3
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:14,115
by something impossible.

4
00:00:14,117 --> 00:00:17,151
My father went to prison
for her murder.

5
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:20,321
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

6
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:24,558
To the outside world, I am
an ordinary forensic scientist,

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,962
but secretly,
I use my speed to fight crime

8
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:29,497
and find others like me.

9
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,999
And one day,
I'll find who killed my mother

10
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,568
and get justice for my father.

11
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,604
That day is today.

13
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:44,545
What?
No Big Belly Burger?

14
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:46,447
It's one of the few perks
of living in this time.

15
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:47,982
We're out of cows
where I come from.

16
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:51,185
You don't care about that.
You have questions. Go ahead.

17
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:54,121
Not sure where to start...
Thawne.

18
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:57,358
That is your real name...
Eobard Thawne.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,060
- Since the day I was born.
- And when was that?

20
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:00,594
136 years from now.

21
00:01:00,596 --> 00:01:04,698
That's not what
you want to know.

22
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,835
Go ahead, Barry.

23
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:09,103
Ask it.

24
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,940
Why did you kill
my mother?

25
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:15,042
Because I hate you.

26
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:17,211
Not you now.
You years from now.

27
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:20,281
- In the future.
- In a future. Yes.

28
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:22,183
We're enemies, rivals,
opposites,

29
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,451
reverses of one another.

30
00:01:23,453 --> 00:01:25,186
Why?
Wh-why were we enemies?

31
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:27,788
It doesn't matter.

32
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,524
It doesn't...
matter anymore.

33
00:01:30,526 --> 00:01:32,593
What matters is that
neither of us was strong enough

34
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:35,362
to defeat the other.

35
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:38,099
Until I learned your secret.

36
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,835
I learned your name.

37
00:01:40,837 --> 00:01:43,504
Barry Allen.

38
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:47,374
And finally, I knew how
to defeat you once and for all.

39
00:01:47,376 --> 00:01:51,278
Travel back in time,
kill you as a child.

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,148
Wipe you
from the face of the earth.

41
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,085
But then you, future you,
that is, followed me back,

42
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:00,020
and we fought.

43
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:03,858
We both landed
some pretty solid shots.

44
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,829
And then you, future you, got
your younger self out of there.

45
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:11,599
I was so mad.

46
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:16,370
But then I thought...

47
00:02:16,372 --> 00:02:20,207
what if you were
to suffer a tragedy?

48
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,911
What if you were to suffer
something so horrible,

49
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:26,514
so traumatic that your child
self could never recover?

50
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:29,049
Then you would not become
The Flash.

51
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:32,253
And so I stabbed your mother
in the heart,

52
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:33,854
and I was free.

53
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,725
Finally able to return
to a future without The Flash,

54
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:41,996
only to realize
that in traveling back

55
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:44,698
I'd lost my way home.

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,068
Lost my ability to harness
the speed force.

57
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,505
And without it,
I was stuck here.

58
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:54,542
Stranded in this time,
unable to return to my own.

59
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:59,180
And the only way back
was The Flash.

60
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:02,716
But The Flash was gone,
and so I created him.

61
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:10,024
Why train me?

62
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:12,593
Why help me save
so many people?

63
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:16,330
Because I needed you
to get fast.

64
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:21,001
Fast enough to rupture
the space-time barrier

65
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,970
and create
a stable wormhole

66
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:25,973
through which
I could return home.

67
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:27,575
Why would I
ever do that?

68
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:29,043
Because...

69
00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:34,281
Barry Allen,
if you give me what I want,

70
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:36,517
I'm gonna give you
what you want.

71
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:41,722
You can go back
and save your mother.

72
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:44,925
You can prevent your father
from going to prison.

73
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:48,629
You can reunite
the Allen family.

74
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,434
No.

75
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:55,836
No, I don't
believe you.

76
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:00,341
I want to kill you
right now.

77
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:02,042
I know that rage.

78
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:04,778
I used to feel that rage
every time I looked upon you.

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,649
And now, somehow,

80
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:13,687
I know
what Joe and Henry feel

81
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:16,890
when they look on you
with pride.

82
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:18,125
With love.

83
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,293
No. No.

84
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:22,162
Don't you
ever say that to me!

85
00:04:22,164 --> 00:04:24,031
I know you're upset,

86
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:27,134
but I'm giving you
a chance.

87
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:33,207
I'm giving you a chance to undo
all the evil I've done.

88
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,743
Don't you want that chance?

89
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:53,594
The rare opportunity to go
back in time and right a wrong

90
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:56,830
and save your mother's life...

91
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:59,767
Quite the paradox Harrison has
presented you with, Mr. Allen.

92
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:02,970
The chance to be
with someone you love?

93
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:04,838
Seems pretty cut and dry
to me.

94
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,541
At first blush, Dr. Snow,
it would appear so,

95
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:12,680
but this gift
has unparalleled risk.

96
00:05:12,682 --> 00:05:14,748
Barry, the night
your mother died,

97
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,817
the night you saved yourself
from being killed,

98
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:21,555
that event altered the timeline
you were already on

99
00:05:21,557 --> 00:05:23,757
and changed
the course of history.

100
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,328
So what you're saying is we're
living in a parallel universe?

101
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,496
Just like when
I time travelled before.

102
00:05:29,498 --> 00:05:31,899
But he... he only changed
one day that time.

103
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:37,771
Exactly. Now imagine 15 years
of compounded experiences.

104
00:05:37,773 --> 00:05:40,040
One different decision,
no matter how big or small,

105
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:42,343
impacts everything that follows.

106
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,312
Moments upon moments,
choices upon choices.

107
00:05:45,314 --> 00:05:49,783
No relationships,
nothing would be as it is today,

108
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:51,352
and you'd never know
the difference

109
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:54,455
because you'd never
remember any of it.

110
00:05:56,624 --> 00:06:01,328
So if I go back
and save my mom,

111
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,165
my dad doesn't go to prison.

112
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:08,502
I never live
with Joe and Iris.

113
00:06:08,504 --> 00:06:13,807
You might never meet me.
Or Caitlin or Ronnie.

114
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:18,078
Truth is,
there's no real way

115
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,482
of knowing what
your life will be.

116
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:29,323
There's no choice here, Barry.
You have to do this.

117
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,658
You gotta change the past.

118
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:40,467
Joe?

119
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:44,438
So what...
What, that's it?

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,007
You think I should
just do it?

121
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,912
Yeah, I do.

122
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:55,449
Which means I will never
come to live with you, and...

123
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:57,718
you're okay with that?

124
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,422
Barry, you get the chance
to grow up with both parents.

125
00:07:01,424 --> 00:07:03,624
You don't have to grow up
without a mother.

126
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:05,192
What about growing up
without a father?

127
00:07:05,194 --> 00:07:09,897
You will have a father...
Your real father.

128
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:14,101
Wells has messed with our lives
long enough.

129
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,970
This is why you became
The Flash, Barry.

130
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,872
To put things right.

131
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:24,211
You saved a lot of
people's lives this past year.

132
00:07:24,213 --> 00:07:26,046
Now it's time
to save yours.

133
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:49,736
Dad, look.
I know this sounds crazy.

134
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:52,206
I think
we're way past crazy, slugger.

135
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,710
Look, you're fast, I get it.
But turning back time...

136
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:59,079
No, I wouldn't be
turning time back.

137
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:02,716
I would be...
going back

138
00:08:02,718 --> 00:08:05,285
to that night
to save her.

139
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:08,922
And what does Joe think
about all this?

140
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:13,160
He thinks
I should do it.

141
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:15,195
No.

142
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:16,763
You can't.

143
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,835
Dad...

144
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:27,241
I can make it so that night
will never have happened.

145
00:08:27,243 --> 00:08:28,742
We'll be a family again.

146
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:30,244
We are a family.

147
00:08:30,246 --> 00:08:32,913
Not like this.
Not without Mom.

148
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:38,118
Barry, there's a natural order
to things, okay?

149
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,686
Things happen the way they do.

150
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:41,788
We may not know why
at the time,

151
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,924
but there must always be
a reason.

152
00:08:43,926 --> 00:08:47,394
Now, I believe that.
I've had to believe it.

153
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:52,099
I... I can save Mom.

154
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,568
At what cost?

155
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,104
You said time would change.
What if it changes you?

156
00:08:57,106 --> 00:08:59,439
- I don't care.
- I do.

157
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:05,012
I am in awe

158
00:09:05,014 --> 00:09:09,583
of the remarkable man
that you are becoming...

159
00:09:09,585 --> 00:09:13,020
All the things you've achieved,
and not just as The Flash,

160
00:09:13,022 --> 00:09:14,354
but you, Barry.

161
00:09:14,356 --> 00:09:17,024
Your honesty.
Your heart.

162
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,495
You were always a hero.

163
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:25,165
And your mom would be
just as proud.

164
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:27,100
And if she had a say in this,

165
00:09:27,102 --> 00:09:29,469
if she thought for one second
that you going back to save her

166
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:32,239
would mean you losing
what makes you so special,

167
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:34,641
she would never want that.

168
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,114
Barry, what I hope for you,

169
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:44,618
maybe the greatest thing that
a father can hope for his son

170
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,190
is that one day, you will become
a father yourself.

171
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:52,392
And then you will know...

172
00:09:55,597 --> 00:09:59,933
How much I truly love you.

173
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:08,008
98.6. Normal.

174
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,077
I don't even know
what that word means anymore.

175
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,712
Me neither.

176
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:12,980
I know Barry
really appreciates you

177
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:14,648
coming back to help him
stop Wells.

178
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,284
That's not the only reason
I'm back, Cait.

179
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,152
I'm here now.
For good.

180
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:20,721
But I thought...

181
00:10:20,723 --> 00:10:23,256
I thought too...
I thought too much

182
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:26,093
about what might happen if
the government tracked us down.

183
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:28,562
If we couldn't control
our powers and we hurt someone.

184
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:31,765
If we hurt you.

185
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:37,804
But I realized that although
sometimes I'm more than one man,

186
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,474
I'm not whole
unless I'm with you.

187
00:10:40,476 --> 00:10:42,643
I love you, Cait.

188
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,515
- Are you sure?
- I am.

189
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:53,320
Once upon a time and a
Particle Accelerator or so ago,

190
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:54,322
you agreed to marry me.

191
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:56,189
Yes, I did.

192
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:58,525
What do you say
we do that?

193
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:09,169
Thought I might find you here.

194
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:14,041
I needed to get
out of the lab.

195
00:11:18,047 --> 00:11:20,280
I thought this would be
a good place to think.

196
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:21,682
Oh, it is.
Trust me.

197
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:25,719
I've done a lot
of thinking up here.

198
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:27,454
When I wasn't having
clandestine meetings

199
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:30,057
with the mysterious
"streak."

200
00:11:31,694 --> 00:11:35,228
Yeah, not mad
we lost that name.

201
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,631
Hey, I thought that
had pizzazz.

202
00:11:39,535 --> 00:11:41,902
- No.
- Uh-uh.

203
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:50,077
So are you gonna do it?

204
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:56,650
It's just so... huge.

205
00:11:56,652 --> 00:11:58,185
It's the biggest decision
of my life,

206
00:11:58,187 --> 00:12:02,422
and if I'm wrong,
I can't undo it.

207
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:04,091
Why would you
want to?

208
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:10,163
I mean, you'd get to see
your mom again, your dad,

209
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:13,100
have a great career,

210
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:16,002
even get married.

211
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:20,006
Iris West-Allen, huh?

212
00:12:20,008 --> 00:12:22,776
I never really thought of myself
as a hyphenator.

213
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:25,946
Must be a 2024 thing.

214
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:30,016
We don't know that
that's going to happen.

215
00:12:30,018 --> 00:12:35,455
Do you think that because you
didn't live with us,

216
00:12:35,457 --> 00:12:37,657
that's why things
are different there?

217
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,727
Growing up together and...

218
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:45,866
knowing so much
about each other...

219
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:50,036
it made it hard for me to admit
how I felt about you.

220
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,142
And I waited too long, and you
fell in love with Eddie.

221
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:02,249
But living with you
and Joe...

222
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,854
I've had a great life,
Iris.

223
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:12,692
Come here,
Barry.

224
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:21,535
What do you think
I should do?

225
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:23,637
I need someone to tell me.

226
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:30,811
I think...

227
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:34,447
that for once in your life,
Barry Allen,

228
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:36,917
you should stop thinking
about other people.

229
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,353
I think you should do
what's in your heart.

230
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:42,889
Do what you need to do
for yourself.

231
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:53,033
Ah!

232
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:56,069
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

233
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:57,637
it took you a whole hour
longer to decide

234
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,639
than I thought it would.

235
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,409
So how does this work?

236
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,045
Your grand plan?

237
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,414
Well, it's really not
that grand at all, Barry.

238
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,082
In fact, it's rather simple.

239
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:10,617
We use
the Particle Accelerator.

240
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,085
The Particle Accelerator.

241
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:14,955
The last time that happened,
you caused an explosion

242
00:14:14,957 --> 00:14:16,690
that hurt a lot of people.

243
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:19,893
This time, the accelerator
will operate exactly

244
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:21,528
the way it was designed to.

245
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,099
Except, instead of two particles
moving in opposite directions,

246
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:28,101
colliding at the speed of light
in the inner ring,

247
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:30,770
we're only going
to inject one particle

248
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:32,806
into the accelerator.

249
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,942
And I'm what
it collides with.

250
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:38,211
And if you can go fast enough,
Barry,

251
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:41,915
if you can hit that particle
with enough speed,

252
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:45,118
you will punch a hole right
though the fabric of reality.

253
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,222
And you will create a portal
connecting this time

254
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:51,958
to infinite times.

255
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,293
A wormhole.

256
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:56,897
Through which one might travel
back to the past, say,

257
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,067
to the night your mother died or
forward to the future, to, say,

258
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:03,670
my time.

259
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:06,873
You said<i> if</i> I run fast enough.

260
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,475
What happens if I don't?

261
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:12,312
If you don't achieve
the desired velocity barrier,

262
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:13,747
you'll die.

263
00:15:19,954 --> 00:15:21,788
According to
Wells' calculations,

264
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,491
Barry super-speeds
inside the accelerator ring.

265
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:27,027
Once Barry
reaches optimum speed,

266
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,764
we then launch a hydrogen proton
into the accelerator.

267
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:34,234
Once the collision happens,
a wormhole forms,

268
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:38,471
opening a gateway
into time itself.

269
00:15:38,473 --> 00:15:40,874
It's at that moment
I plan on shouting something

270
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:43,710
along the lines of "Eureka"
or possibly "Excelsior."

271
00:15:43,712 --> 00:15:46,212
I'm uncommitted.

272
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:48,615
What do you think?

273
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:51,584
I mean, on the one hand,

274
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:53,620
it does make a kind of sense.

275
00:15:53,622 --> 00:15:55,355
On the other hand,

276
00:15:55,357 --> 00:15:56,690
why?

277
00:15:56,692 --> 00:15:59,459
Why, why would you ever
consider doing this?

278
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:01,027
You know why.

279
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,863
So, for this to actually work,
how fast would Barry have to go?

280
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:07,834
By my estimates,
Mach Two at a minimum.

281
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:09,903
You've never gone that fast.

282
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,872
So what happens if Barry
doesn't reach that speed?

283
00:16:12,874 --> 00:16:15,408
I mean, I'm imagining a bug
hitting a windshield.

284
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,510
How far off am I?

285
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:19,546
Not very far,
I'm afraid.

286
00:16:19,548 --> 00:16:22,983
Let me worry about
how fast I have to go.

287
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:24,150
We're gonna need
something else too.

288
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:26,219
Really?
And what's that?

289
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,088
'Cause I don't know
about you guys,

290
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,992
but I'm not at all interested in
helping you get yourself killed.

291
00:16:31,994 --> 00:16:35,362
I need you to build
a time machine.

292
00:16:35,364 --> 00:16:37,864
Go on.

293
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:39,733
So, if Wells is as fast as you,

294
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:41,735
what's he need
a time machine for?

295
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:44,270
Apparently he lost his speed
when he killed my mom.

296
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:47,007
He gets it back sometimes
but only in spurts.

297
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,274
He can't fully
control it.

298
00:16:48,276 --> 00:16:49,709
So I was right
about the wheelchair.

299
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:51,244
He was using it
to charge himself.

300
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:53,546
So after I open the wormhole,
he's gonna need the ship

301
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:55,949
to travel back
to the future.

302
00:16:55,951 --> 00:16:57,851
He's been squirreling away
the parts.

303
00:16:57,853 --> 00:16:59,652
Now we just need
to put it together.

304
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:02,856
Ronnie, I love you,
but this is a time machine,

305
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:04,657
not a bookcase from IKEA.

306
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,259
We got a problem.

307
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:07,994
These tiles...
They're made of tungsten.

308
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:09,362
Well, tungsten does have
the highest melting point

309
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:10,764
of any other element.

310
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:12,899
Yeah, but the dust
it generates is flammable.

311
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,534
The pressure exerted
from the wormhole...

312
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:15,969
Yeah. Yeah.

313
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:19,105
It could cause a hole to be
melted into the exterior.

314
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:21,408
It could explode.

315
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,043
Any ideas?

316
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:25,745
Let me ask Dr. Evil.

317
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:28,681
Which used to be
a name that made me smile.

318
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,389
Something on your mind,
Cisco?

319
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:38,591
No.

320
00:17:38,593 --> 00:17:39,793
Yes.

321
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:42,595
How did you fit
your Reverse-Flash suit

322
00:17:42,597 --> 00:17:43,963
into that little ring?

323
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:46,099
Is it some sort
of compressed micro tech?

324
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:49,702
Or actually, forget it.
I don't care.

325
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:53,406
Maybe a little.

326
00:17:53,408 --> 00:17:54,908
Ronnie's right.

327
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,876
I should have accounted
for the temporal shearing.

328
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:59,179
Glad we're still good
for something.

329
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:03,183
I never underestimated
your contribution, Cisco.

330
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:04,417
Or Ronnie's.

331
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:06,019
As a matter of fact,

332
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:09,689
do you know how many times
I wished you were there with me

333
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:11,024
as I rebuilt the accelerator?

334
00:18:11,026 --> 00:18:12,258
It would have been
a lot more fun.

335
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,159
Yeah?

336
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:14,961
Well, doesn't change the fact

337
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:17,664
that your nifty little
Time Sphere...

338
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,065
Is that what you're calling it?

339
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,834
Whatever it's called.
It's gonna blow.

340
00:18:20,836 --> 00:18:22,836
Not if you cement the tiles
with a cobalt resin.

341
00:18:22,838 --> 00:18:26,372
That'll prevent degradation
in conditions of extreme heat.

342
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,375
Okay. Fine.
We'll try that.

343
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:31,010
That's it? That's all?

344
00:18:31,012 --> 00:18:32,011
Well, what do you
want me to say?

345
00:18:32,013 --> 00:18:33,713
I don't know, Cisco.

346
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,448
I thought that of anyone, you'd
be a little more understanding

347
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,416
of my predicament.

348
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,685
I don't belong here.

349
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:41,855
These barbaric times.

350
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,389
It's like
living amongst the dead.

351
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:47,160
Is that what you told yourself?
When you killed me?

352
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:52,465
What?

353
00:18:52,467 --> 00:18:53,967
What did you say?

354
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:58,505
It was an alternate timeline.

355
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:00,573
One that Barry reset.

356
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:02,242
But I never forgot it.

357
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:06,079
It just kept
coming back to me.

358
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:09,249
And I can still picture

359
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:11,651
the way you looked at me

360
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:14,287
when you called me a son

361
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:19,392
and you crushed my heart
with your fist.

362
00:19:19,394 --> 00:19:22,495
Cisco...

363
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:23,730
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:26,466
Yeah.
It sucked.

365
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:28,368
Not for killing you.
I'm sure I had a good reason.

366
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:30,537
I'm sorry for the fact that
you're able to retain traces

367
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,105
of another timeline.

368
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:35,375
You're able to see through
the vibrations of the universe.

369
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,710
It means...

370
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:40,513
I wasn't sure
until just now.

371
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,781
Sure of what?

372
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:47,487
The night the Particle
Accelerator exploded...

373
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:52,926
You were affected too.

374
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:57,964
What are you talking about?

375
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,067
No.

376
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:04,904
I wasn't.

377
00:20:04,906 --> 00:20:07,774
Don't be afraid, Cisco.

378
00:20:07,776 --> 00:20:13,246
A great and honorable destiny
awaits you now.

379
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:18,718
I only hope that as you're
living your great adventure,

380
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,421
that you remember
who gave you that life.

381
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:27,327
And that it was given
out of love.

382
00:20:42,343 --> 00:20:44,043
I'm sorry, but I'm told
this is the only station

383
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,312
with enough power
to run these calculations.

384
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,481
If we make the slightest error
creating the wormhole...

385
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:49,949
Say no more.

386
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:51,451
Joe told me to stick around
in case I was needed,

387
00:20:51,453 --> 00:20:52,885
but it seems
I'm only in the way.

388
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:56,623
Everyone has
a contribution to make.

389
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,158
Perhaps you just haven't
discovered yours yet.

390
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,927
No, Dr. Wells made it
pretty clear when he told me

391
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,395
about the future.

392
00:21:02,397 --> 00:21:03,997
I don't matter.

393
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:05,199
As far as history's concerned,

394
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,301
I don't save the day
or get the girl.

395
00:21:08,303 --> 00:21:10,803
And you believed him?

396
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:14,073
He had a newspaper
from the year 2024.

397
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:17,443
And I have a mug that says
"World's Best Boss."

398
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:20,446
I doubt my teaching assistant
would testify

399
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,583
to its authenticity.

400
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:29,622
We're dealing with a lot
of big scientific ideas today.

401
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:34,294
But you, Mr. Thawne, might be
the most interesting thing here

402
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:35,762
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

403
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:37,530
Me?

404
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:40,867
What are the odds that Dr. Wells
would travel back in time

405
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,069
and get stuck
in the exact same city

406
00:21:43,071 --> 00:21:46,105
as his great-great-great-
great-grandfather?

407
00:21:46,107 --> 00:21:49,475
Working in the same profession,
the same building?

408
00:21:49,477 --> 00:21:52,512
And that part of his plan
to get home would mean

409
00:21:52,514 --> 00:21:56,683
that he'd have to preserve
and protect your life.

410
00:21:56,685 --> 00:22:02,655
That makes you this rare thing
that no scientist can plan for.

411
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:04,791
Which is?

412
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:07,026
Coincidence.

413
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:11,964
There is no science
to coincidence.

414
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:15,468
You, sir, are an anomaly.

415
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,138
A wild card, as it were.

416
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,041
You are the only person
in this whole story

417
00:22:22,043 --> 00:22:25,912
who gets to choose
his own future.

418
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:28,848
At least, that's my opinion.

419
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:33,119
Wait, that can't be right.

420
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:35,588
Oh, dear.

421
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,590
- We have a problem.
- What?

422
00:22:37,592 --> 00:22:39,859
The calculations.
There is a danger.

423
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:42,261
I know.
I'm ready to take the risk.

424
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:45,164
No, not just to you
but to everyone.

425
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,933
Wells didn't tell us everything.

426
00:22:46,935 --> 00:22:50,370
Barry, even if you do reach
the right speed,

427
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:52,305
colliding
with the hydrogen particle,

428
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:57,543
there is a chance that explosion
could create a singularity.

429
00:22:57,545 --> 00:22:58,545
What's a singularity?

430
00:22:58,546 --> 00:22:59,445
It's a black hole.

431
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:01,514
We could destroy
Central City.

432
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:02,882
For starters.

433
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:08,020
If we create a singularity here
and then cannot control it,

434
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:12,191
we could be looking
at a global catastrophe.

435
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:16,329
So long and thanks
for all the fish.

436
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,536
Well, sure,
there's a bit of a risk.

437
00:23:23,538 --> 00:23:25,171
I would hardly refer
to possibly causing

438
00:23:25,173 --> 00:23:26,506
an extinction-level event as
"a bit of a risk."

439
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:28,374
Yeah, and your accelerator's

440
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:31,043
been about as reliable as the
beater I drove in high school.

441
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,045
Let me ask you a question.

442
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:36,682
How many meta-humans...

443
00:23:36,684 --> 00:23:37,917
How many dangers...

444
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,287
Have we faced
this year together?

445
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,656
Or did you forget
that was me

446
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:46,092
fighting alongside
each and every one of you?

447
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:48,661
I have been planning this
for almost two decades.

448
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:50,129
It will work.

449
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,031
And how do we make sure
we don't open a black hole

450
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:53,466
in the middle
of Central City?

451
00:23:53,468 --> 00:23:56,102
So, once the wormhole
stabilizes,

452
00:23:56,104 --> 00:24:00,039
Barry will have 1 minute
and 52 seconds to alter the past

453
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:01,908
and return to this time.

454
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,609
If and when he does that,

455
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,611
you can close the wormhole,

456
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:07,613
and we can all live
happily ever after.

457
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:08,948
Almost two minutes.

458
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,050
More than enough time
to save Nora.

459
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:14,187
But not enough time
to stop you from going home?

460
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:16,556
Everything's a choice.

461
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:18,624
And what if I'm late?

462
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:21,427
You won't be.
I believe in you, Barry.

463
00:24:21,429 --> 00:24:22,228
Always have.

464
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,863
So I guess the question is,

465
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:26,933
do your friends and family
believe in you as much as I do?

466
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:50,656
So, if I don't run fast enough
to collide with the particle,

467
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:53,025
then I'm dust,
and if I do run fast enough

468
00:24:53,027 --> 00:24:54,994
but I'm not back here in time,
then a black hole will form,

469
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:57,530
swallow up the city
and possibly the world.

470
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:00,800
You're sure you still want to
look me in the eyes and tell me

471
00:25:00,802 --> 00:25:03,069
this is for the best?

472
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:06,339
I'd be lying
if I told you I did.

473
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:12,311
Truth is, I don't...
I don't know what to think.

474
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:13,646
I thought
you were the sure one.

475
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:15,548
I...

476
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,450
was kind of banking on that
when I made my decision

477
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:20,019
the first time.

478
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:22,021
I was faking it.

479
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:23,256
Sometimes parents do that.

480
00:25:23,258 --> 00:25:26,425
Most of the time,
parents do that.

481
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:31,531
Look, of course I'm scared.

482
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:35,968
But I didn't want you to not
help your mother

483
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,503
because you were worried
about me.

484
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:40,072
Well, I'll always worry
about you, Joe,

485
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,308
just like you'll always worry
about me.

486
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,011
Sorry,
but you can't stop that.

487
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:53,219
Do you think I can do this?

488
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:56,389
You think
I can save my mom?

489
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:58,324
I mean, do you think
I'm fast enough?

490
00:25:58,326 --> 00:25:59,392
Yes.

491
00:26:00,694 --> 00:26:02,428
I know you are.

492
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:10,836
You know, I've... I've dreamed
my whole life about...

493
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:13,205
saving her,

494
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:16,609
freeing my dad, and...

495
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:19,011
I never thought I'd have to lose
another parent to do that.

496
00:26:19,013 --> 00:26:20,279
Barry...

497
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:23,583
Joe, it's true.
It's true.

498
00:26:23,585 --> 00:26:26,252
I've always been
so focused on everything

499
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:31,557
that I lost that night,
but I gained so much too.

500
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:36,395
I was born with one father,
and that tragedy gave me...

501
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,130
another.

502
00:26:39,733 --> 00:26:42,768
And I don't think
I can lose you.

503
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,504
You won't ever
lose me.

504
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:48,507
Ever, you hear me?

505
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:50,309
Ever.

506
00:26:57,884 --> 00:27:00,019
Wow, slow news day?

507
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:05,558
If they only knew, right?

508
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,028
I thought you would be
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

509
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,496
I was.

510
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,732
Then I got hungry,
so I went to Mama Chows.

511
00:27:12,734 --> 00:27:16,035
For dim sum?
Your favorite.

512
00:27:16,037 --> 00:27:18,404
And to remind myself
of something.

513
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:19,406
What?

514
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:28,214
A coincidence. A pretty big
coincidence, actually.

515
00:27:28,216 --> 00:27:32,051
About a year and a half ago,
I had a date with this girl.

516
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:35,888
Katie Rogers.
She was a dancer.

517
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,124
We had plans to meet
at Mama Chows,

518
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:39,458
but she texted me.

519
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,926
She pulled a hamstring
and had to cancel.

520
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:43,496
Oh, those fragile dancers.

521
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:47,833
I was bummed 'cause I was
looking forward to it.

522
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:50,903
So I had dinner by myself,
and I was walking home

523
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:55,107
when I saw a mugger
running with a stolen backpack.

524
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:56,876
Your backpack.

525
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:59,812
And I arrested him.

526
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:02,448
That's how you and I met.

527
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,950
I remember.

528
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:08,020
Someone just told me how
powerful a coincidence can be,

529
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:12,124
and it made me realize how many
coincidences had to happen

530
00:28:12,126 --> 00:28:15,027
for you and I to get together...

531
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:18,264
in this time.

532
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:22,034
We've all been so focused on
Barry's destiny,

533
00:28:22,036 --> 00:28:25,104
I forgot that I have one too.

534
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:31,010
And it's you.

535
00:28:31,012 --> 00:28:34,146
Iris West,

536
00:28:34,148 --> 00:28:38,851
every moment of my life
led to meeting you.

537
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,456
Screw the future.

538
00:28:46,127 --> 00:28:48,194
Screw the future.

539
00:28:54,102 --> 00:28:55,901
Is this actually binding?

540
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:59,672
My father made me become a rabbi
before he would send me to MIT.

541
00:28:59,674 --> 00:29:02,641
This will be "legit,"
as the kids say.

542
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,076
No kids say that.

543
00:29:04,078 --> 00:29:05,277
Let's not fight
on our wedding day.

If it's all right with everyone,
I'd like to skip all the Hebrew.

547
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,625
I've learned a lot

548
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:22,995
about merging one's life
with another this past year.

549
00:29:22,997 --> 00:29:26,799
Yet, for all the incredible
advancements in science

550
00:29:26,801 --> 00:29:28,400
we've all been party to,

551
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:32,171
the mystery that brings
two people together through love

552
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:34,907
is still the province of magic.

553
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,509

I don't need one.

560
00:29:53,161 --> 00:29:56,562
I have everything
and everyone

561
00:29:56,564 --> 00:30:00,499

right here.

562
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:01,600

of the past year

00:30:03,471 --> 00:30:07,039

00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:10,109
it was worth it.

00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:12,344
I love you, Ronnie.

567
00:30:12,346 --> 00:30:14,680
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

568
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,248
You may kiss the bride.

569
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,716

There are gonna be three yous
back there...

577
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:46,445
The you from the future

578
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:47,847
who saved younger you
from the Reverse-Flash

579
00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:49,181
and now<i> you</i> you.

580
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:53,118
Remember, wait until future you
gets younger you out of there,

581
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,654
and then you can go
and save your mom.

582
00:30:55,656 --> 00:30:58,123
Piece of cake.

583
00:30:58,125 --> 00:31:00,459
May the Speed Force
be with you.

584
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:07,199
Good-bye, Dad.

585
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,372
Good-bye, Son.

586
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:16,642
Iris...

587
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:19,311
You don't have
to say anything.

588
00:31:19,313 --> 00:31:20,913
I already know.

589
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:29,288
I hope whatever life you get,
it's enough for you.

590
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,457
That it makes
you happy.

591
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:32,558
You too.

592
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:54,880
Remember, Mr. Allen,

593
00:31:54,882 --> 00:31:57,549
assuming you achieve the proper
velocity and open the wormhole,

594
00:31:57,551 --> 00:32:00,719
you will only have
1 minute and 52 seconds

595
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,755
to save your mother
and return.

596
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:03,757
Or else...

597
00:32:03,758 --> 00:32:05,224
I know.

598
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:10,562
Well...

599
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:14,266
you hold both our futures
in your hands now, Mr. Allen.

600
00:32:14,268 --> 00:32:16,902
And I know you can do it.

601
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:18,237
Now...

602
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:21,040
Run...

603
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,142
Barry.

604
00:32:23,144 --> 00:32:24,443
Run.

605
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,221
The accelerator's structural
integrity is holding.

606
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,057
What was that?

607
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:39,258
Is Barry okay?

608
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,695
Yeah.
He just passed Mach Two.

609
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:54,740
I was waiting for you
to bring Barry home.

610
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:58,677
Looks like he's going to be
staying with us for a while.

611
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:01,113
Barry, what you're seeing is
the Speed Force:

612
00:33:01,115 --> 00:33:04,283
your past, you present,
your future

613
00:33:04,285 --> 00:33:05,818
all at once.

614
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,421
So you need to focus
on where you want to go.

615
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,890
So think about...

616
00:33:11,892 --> 00:33:13,926
that night.

617
00:33:13,928 --> 00:33:17,730
Think about your mother.

618
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:21,033
Time for bed.
Good night, slugger.

619
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:23,535
Mom!

620
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,008
It's working.

621
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:33,479
It's working.

622
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:37,349
Inject the hydrogen particle
now.

623
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,088
What's that?
What happened?

624
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,356
Barry... he's gone.

625
00:33:44,358 --> 00:33:46,225
- Look.
- The wormhole.

626
00:33:46,227 --> 00:33:47,993
And it's stable.
Start the clock.

627
00:34:07,114 --> 00:34:09,581
Mom!

628
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:11,083
Mom!

629
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:12,085
Barry!

630
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:13,819
Mom!

631
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:19,391
Nora! Hold on!

632
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:31,970
Run, Barry, run!

633
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:36,108
Barry, no!

634
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:40,712
No, no, no!

635
00:35:03,237 --> 00:35:06,338
Hey. It's okay.
It's okay. You're okay.

636
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,607
Please. My husband,
my son, are they...

637
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,409
They're okay.

638
00:35:10,411 --> 00:35:11,944
They're both safe.

639
00:35:11,946 --> 00:35:14,713
I promise.

640
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:16,748
Who are you?

641
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,017
I'm...

642
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:24,156
I'm The Flash.

643
00:35:24,158 --> 00:35:25,924
I don't understand.

644
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,973
You look
just like my father.

645
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:49,448
This won't make
any sense,

646
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,917
but it's me, Mom.

647
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,786
It's Barry.

648
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:55,788
Barry?

649
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:57,222
Your Barry.

650
00:35:57,224 --> 00:35:58,991
Oh, my beautiful boy.

651
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:06,064
I got a second chance

652
00:36:06,066 --> 00:36:09,067
to come back here and...

653
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:14,640
Tell you that I'm okay.

654
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:18,577
Dad and I are
both okay.

655
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:22,314
And we love you, Mom.

656
00:36:22,316 --> 00:36:24,917
I love you.

657
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,419
I love you.

658
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:30,856
Oh, my sweet boy.

659
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:34,126
Bye. Good-bye.

660
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:37,462
Good-bye, Barry.

661
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:40,632
Mom.

662
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:43,569
Mom.

663
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:08,794
I believe it's time to
say good-bye to Harrison Wells.

664
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,768
It's beautiful.

665
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,705
Rip Hunter would
be impressed.

666
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,907
He built
the first one of these.

667
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:23,542
Interesting man.

668
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,715
Now what the hell
is that?

669
00:37:29,717 --> 00:37:31,917
That's my cue to leave.

670
00:37:35,488 --> 00:37:37,456
Thank you, Cisco.

671
00:37:37,458 --> 00:37:39,491
Don't ever come back.

672
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,083
30 seconds.

673
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,726
Home.

674
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,874
- Oh, my God.
- Barry.

675
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:31,176
We have to shut down
the wormhole quickly!

676
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:34,046
Caitlin!

677
00:38:40,888 --> 00:38:43,055
You didn't save her.

678
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,690
Why?

679
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:45,991
Why?

680
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:48,627
You could have had
the life you wanted.

681
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:51,863
You could have had
everything you ever wanted!

682
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:54,900
I already do.

683
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:00,639
Not for long.

684
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:05,777
Cut the internal generators.

685
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:10,048
Ten seconds, hurry.

686
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:27,065
Three, two, one.

687
00:39:28,735 --> 00:39:30,369
Ronnie, are you okay?

688
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:31,703
Did you do it?

689
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,205
Yes, I turned them
all off.

690
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:38,210
They did it.
They cut the generator.

691
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,683
Just so we're clear,

692
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,118
after I kill you,

693
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,786
I'm going to kill them.

694
00:39:47,788 --> 00:39:50,055
And then I'm going
to kill your father.

695
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:53,225
I always win, Flash.

696
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:02,300
Eddie! Oh, my...

697
00:40:03,669 --> 00:40:05,003
Eddie!

698
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:06,638
What did you do?

699
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:12,878
What did you do?
What did you do?

700
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,747
No such thing
as a coincidence.

701
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:20,085
What's happening?

702
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:21,720
Cisco, help me.

703
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:24,289
Eddie's his ancestor.

704
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,958
If Eddie dies,
he'll never be born, and...

705
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:31,263
He's being erased
from existence.

706
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:36,635
No! No!
Eddie.

707
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,236
Eddie, no, no.

708
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:41,306
Stay with me, okay?
Stay.

709
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:44,976
He was wrong,
it turns out.

710
00:40:44,978 --> 00:40:46,678
I'm a hero after all.

711
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,748
You are, Eddie.
You are my hero.

712
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,151
That's all
I ever wanted to be.

713
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:54,719
Your hero.

714
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:02,561
No!

715
00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:11,903
I've controlled your life
for so long, Barry.

716
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:14,973
How will you get along
without me?

717
00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:43,535
Guys, that's not good.

718
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,036
Professor, I shut down
the wormhole.

719
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:47,172
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

720
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,741
You did close it,
but it seems to be reopening.

721
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:51,309
We got to go.

722
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:53,712
You okay?

723
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:55,146
Iris, we have to go.

724
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:57,816
I'm not leaving him.

725
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:00,385
We have to go now, honey.
I'm sorry.

726
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:18,637
So that's what
we didn't want to happen.

727
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,372
- What's it doing?
- Feeding.

728
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:24,743
A singularity won't stop, not
even after the earth is gone.

729
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:47,465
I'm afraid the accretion disc
has already assembled.

730
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:48,467
What?

731
00:42:48,468 --> 00:42:49,901
The diffuse material

732
00:42:49,903 --> 00:42:51,670
that's in orbital motion
around the singularity.

733
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:52,704
What does that mean?

734
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:54,539
We have to disrupt the motion.

735
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:57,809
Basically it's just like
the tornado, only upside down.

736
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:59,411
And bigger.

737
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,046
And scarier.

738
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:02,881
Barry, that event
has an energy level

739
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:05,417
of at least
6.7 Tera Electron Volts.

740
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,885
It cannot be stopped.

741
00:43:10,222 --> 00:43:12,891
I have to try.

742
00:43:36,515 --> 00:43:37,515
Oh, God.

743
00:43:37,517 --> 00:43:39,618
Barry.
