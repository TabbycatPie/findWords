7
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,900
Previously, on "Arrow"...

8
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,140
Where's your mother?!

9
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,940
The white-haired woman! She took her!

10
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,820
Deliver Sara's killer, or the citizens of Starling

11
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,220
will see what the League of Assassins is capable of.

12
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,300
I will tell Ra's this was you,

13
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,720
that Thea was under your control.

14
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,610
And he will still kill her. She fired the arrows.

15
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,560
There's nothing that I won't do to protect you.

16
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,810
- What does that mean? - I killed Sara.

17
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,800
By League Law, I have the right to challenge you

18
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,770
to a trial by combat.

19
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,490
You covet death that much?

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,850
Hey, I want air support now!

21
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,790
These bastards, they shot one of our own!

22
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,090
That cop was just asking for my license, man,

23
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,400
you didn't have to shoot him!

24
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,430
Get me closer!

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,130
Come on! Damn it!

26
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,720
Yes!

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,720
It's him!

28
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,710
I thought he was green.

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,860
This bike is sick!

30
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,990
Ok, not supposed to be having fun right now.

31
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,840
Sorry!

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,770
No, sorry is what you'll be

33
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,150
when Oliver finds out you took out his motorcycle.

34
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,990
Ok, I've got him headed your way.

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,420
Aim for the engine block.

36
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,390
There's the green one.

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,090
This suit is too tight.

38
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,800
If they make it to the tunnel, we're going to lose them.

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,930
You're not helping.

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,740
I thought he was supposed to be good!

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,790
Who the hell are you?

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,210
I'm more of a Glock kind of guy.

43
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,270
I didn't say anything.

44
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,030
One caught, one got away,

45
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,100
but even Oliver bats 500 sometimes.

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,400
Any luck finding Oliver?

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,510
Not yet,

48
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,650
but I have every reconnaissance satellite I could hack,

49
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,970
which is a lot, looking for him.

50
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,000
So the second he steps outside, we'll know.

51
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,810
If he steps outside.

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,960
It's what we were all thinking.

53
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,010
I'm not. It's only been three days.

54
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,460
I have to head to my other office for a bit.

55
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,170
Ok, I know it's only been three days,

56
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,870
how much longer before we actually have to start worrying?

57
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,920
I expected this kind of blunder from Mr. Queen,

58
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,170
but not from you.

59
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,510
You were too bold.

60
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,770
You should have checked with me before abducting that scientist.

61
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,680
We were just following the trail for Omega--

62
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,840
like you ordered us to!

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,480
I ordered you to be cautious.

64
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,480
That's how you protect yourself.

65
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,040
And your loved ones.

66
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,630
We need to assemble an extraction team to free my wife.

67
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,360
From where?

68
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,000
We don't know where chien Na Wei is located,

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,560
and we have more pressing concerns.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,300
She has the Omega. We find her, we find Tatsu,

71
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,410
we get them both out of wherever they are.

72
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,320
If only it were that simple.

73
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,910
We've learned that the bio weapon

74
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,400
is actually comprised of two components.

75
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,770
The Omega she has is harmless without its counterpart, Alpha.

76
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,810
And where's that?

77
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,460
Currently in the possession of the Hong Kong military.

78
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,420
- Oh, so it's safe. - Far from it.

79
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,480
The only way to secure the counterpart Alpha is to destroy it.

80
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,700
And by the time we do, my wife will be dead.

81
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,740
Alpha is being kept here,

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,220
in a PLA military laboratory.

83
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,580
The two of you, with back-up,

84
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,160
will break into the facility and recover the vial.

85
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,130
It's tagged with a GPS tracker,

86
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,460
which you'll need to disable before extraction.

87
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,700
And what about Tatsu?

88
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,750
Stop ignoring me!

89
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,750
I'm not ignoring you, Mr. Yamashiro.

90
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,510
I'm merely focusing on the task at hand,

91
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,270
which, at the moment,

92
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,350
is not recovering your wife.

93
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,420
All right.

94
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,150
This will be gauntlet pulse test, 37 Alpha.

95
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,220
Two second burst at 800 volts.

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,450
In

97
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,590
5,

98
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,970
4,

99
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,170
3,

100
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,730
2,

101
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,530
1.

102
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, damn it!

103
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,160
Clowns?

104
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,590
Practice targets.

105
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,440
Clowns always freaked me out as a kid.

106
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,490
Well, you're showing them who's boss now.

107
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,230
Well, I would be, if I could figure out how to modulate

108
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,590
the stress-energy tensor.

109
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,010
Ray, I've been thinking.

110
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,060
About overclocking the magnetic coils? Because I tried that.

111
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,750
No.

112
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,650
About what you're doing.

113
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,760
And about me helping you do it.

114
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,180
Save the city, you mean?

115
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,050
Risk your life.

116
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,450
I know you think you're going to be safe inside that suit of armor.

117
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,870
I know there's like a gajillion movies that make it look easy.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,980
Well, the Arrow and his partner go out there every night,

119
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,600
without armor.

120
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,920
And... one night,

121
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,740
hopefully very far off in the future,

122
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,180
they're not going to come back.

123
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,780
I don't want that to happen to you.

124
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,010
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

125
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,960
Start small.

126
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,820
Just see if you can get the nanite chip to function.

127
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,150
Dad, I will do what I can.

128
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,600
Here we go.

129
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,130
The cop he shot? Father of three.

130
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,570
Doc says he may never walk again,

131
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,520
and that's if he makes it.

132
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,360
'cause right now, he's 50/50.

133
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,740
All right, Miss Lance,

134
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,820
you're up.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,610
The people versus Jermaine Fisher.

136
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,600
Mr. Fisher is charged with 41 counts of attempted murder,

137
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,710
including 16 counts of attempted murder of a police officer.

138
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,730
So no bail is what you're saying?

139
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,340
Vigorously, your honor.

140
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,630
Just as the defendant vigorously moves to dismiss all charges.

141
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,480
Mr. Fisher's apprehension was not affected by the police,

142
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,890
but rather by vigilantes.

143
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,000
The circumstances of Mr. Fisher's arrest are irrelevant.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,880
Produce the Arrow as an eyewitness

145
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
and we'll find out.

146
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,710
That won't be necessary.

147
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,480
We have the weapon with Mr. Fisher's fingerprints all over it,

148
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,270
your honor.

149
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,630
Motion to dismiss denied, bail denied.

150
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,080
Please remand Mr. Fisher into custody.

151
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,360
How did it go at A.R.G.U.S.?

152
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,110
Lyla tapped all of our worldwide contacts.

153
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,210
No sign of Oliver.

154
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,970
And no idea where he could be.

155
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,590
Well, he'll tell us when he gets back.

156
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,850
Until then, we should focus on keeping the lights on.

157
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,930
The two cop shooters we took on last night;

158
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,860
I've been trying to find the one that got away.

159
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,450
Jose Anton.

160
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,460
Anton is attached to a new crew working the Glades,

161
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,660
the head of which is this gentleman.

162
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,570
I know that guy. That's Danny Brickwell.

163
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,490
His street name's Brick.

164
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,010
But I thought he was in Iron Heights.

165
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,300
He was. Until a week ago.

166
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,020
And then the case against him imploded.

167
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,350
By which I mean every single witness

168
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,260
suffered some sort of fatal accident.

169
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,840
Three guesses as to who the police suspect in those cases.

170
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,950
Jermaine Fisher and the guy who got away last night.

171
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,170
Jose Anton.

172
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,490
So they kill witnesses in order to

173
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,210
get Brick out of prison,

174
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,450
and then shoot a cop to do... what?

175
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,470
That's what we have to find out.

176
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
I'll hit the streets.

177
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,050
You have that look you always get

178
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,850
right before you tell Oliver something... sagely.

179
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,500
Yes, and this is about Oliver.

180
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,430
You think I'm in denial.

181
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,130
I think four days ago,

182
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,270
Oliver challenged the world's greatest assassin to a duel.

183
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,330
He survived Lian Yu.

184
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,910
And Hong Kong, and God knows what else.

185
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,900
He defeated Malcolm Merlyn

186
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,890
and Slade Wilson.

187
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,150
You have to believe in him.

188
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,860
Oh, I do believe in him, Felicity.

189
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,640
It's just, I'm preparing myself for the possibility

190
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,860
that things didn't go Oliver's way.

191
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,780
Not this time.

192
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,510
You need to prepare yourself, too.

193
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,260
Please, Oliver, where are you?

194
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,740
Y'all best step off.

195
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,300
Brick is a friend of mine.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,690
You're more than a friend, Anton.

197
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,260
You're like a brother.

198
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,240
Always had my back.

199
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,160
Always loyal.

200
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,520
Stand up.

201
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,900
So when they told me

202
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,260
someone ignored my orders to lay low;

203
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,350
when they told me one of my crew shot a cop...

204
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,240
I beat the man who said it was you.

205
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,520
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,080
Danny, that cop?

207
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,610
It was a mistake.

208
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,600
What we're planning here requires two things.

209
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,880
No mistakes, and the cops not knowing anything.

210
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,200
They still don't. Fisher's not going to say anything.

211
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,680
Was this side job his idea or yours?

212
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,000
It doesn't have to be like this.

213
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,400
Bro!

214
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,240
I dropped my first body with that piece.

215
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,380
You know the deal;

216
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,830
you take me down first, you walk out alive.

217
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,220
He actually tagged me.

218
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,070
All yours, boys.

219
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,290
Your attorney doesn't have

220
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,230
your best interests at heart, Mr. Fisher.

221
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,590
Otherwise, you'd be walking out of here a free man.

222
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,730
Yeah, more like a dead man.

223
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,740
Do you think you scare me more than Brick does?

224
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,050
Think again.

225
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,940
You have a real nice day now.

226
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,640
No, he didn't flip. He likes breathing too much.

227
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,910
When your opponent is the mountain, you must be the sea.

228
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,310
When he is the sea, you must be the mountain.

229
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,900
- Poetic. - Switch your attacks.

230
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,590
Never do the same move more than twice.

231
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,670
Otherwise, your opponent will learn to read you.

232
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Something like that?

233
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,540
Well, I wouldn't recommend texting during a real fight.

234
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,380
Sorry.

235
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,850
I-I thought it might be Ollie.

236
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,350
He hasn't been home. He hasn't returned any of my calls or texts.

237
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,680
I didn't realize his absence was weighing on you.

238
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,940
It's not weighing, it's worrying.

239
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,830
If you like,

240
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,050
I could have some of my old associates

241
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,700
look into Oliver's whereabouts.

242
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,500
Would you?

243
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,810
Of course.

244
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,890
He's family.

245
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,230
According to Laurel, Fisher's lawyer called Brick.

246
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,630
With the time and the place of the outgoing call.

247
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:12,370
Can you trace that call back to where Brick is?

248
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,980
At least where his phone is.

250
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,200
His burner phone, to be exact.

251
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,730
It's at a warehouse in the Glades.

252
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,940
We'll check it out.

253
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,580
I'll have to talk you in from Palmer Tech. I'm crazy-late.

254
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,730
This is the only vulnerable entrance.

255
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,850
Because it's not actually an entrance.

256
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,990
Not until we make it one.

257
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,870
I'll shoot out the glass.

258
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,570
You get in and find the Alpha.

259
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,460
We won't have much time once we breach.

260
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,150
Two minutes max before the alarms draw the police.

261
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,380
Head directly for the lab.

262
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,710
We'll be right behind you.

263
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,080
You ok?

264
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,080
Waller said when we get this done,

265
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,760
she'll get Tatsu back.

266
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,490
She's lying.

267
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,910
On the move! 30 seconds.

268
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,710
Copy that.

269
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,300
I've got eyes on the target warehouse.

270
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,210
But no signs of life.

271
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,620
Felicity, you seeing something I don't?

272
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,340
The warehouse doesn't have any security cameras,

273
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,820
but someone disabled all the traffic cams on that block,

274
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,040
which probably means you're in the right place.

275
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,900
You sure ditching the Arrow suit was a good idea?

276
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,000
Only if I need to move or shoot.

277
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,670
In position.

278
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,510
Clear.

279
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,630
Yeah, I got something.

280
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,750
It's not big enough to be Brick.

281
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,750
Yeah, I know.

282
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,490
What's this?

283
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,340
They burned their burners.

284
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,610
Yeah, torching evidence,

285
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,140
Tying up loose ends.

286
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,900
Evidence of what?

287
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,960
I don't know. These just look like numbers.

288
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,880
I found this.

289
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,370
What looks like some industrial blueprints.

290
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,640
Hmm. These numbers look completely random.

291
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,400
I can run a pattern recognition algorithm.

292
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,520
Oliver?

293
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,550
Oliver?!

294
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,350
Could you put the gun away?

295
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,430
They don't scare so much as annoy me.

296
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,890
I've only come here to talk.

297
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,460
Would it be possible to do that?

298
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,640
Talk about what?

299
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,370
Oliver.

300
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,480
I need to know...

301
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,180
is he still alive?

302
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,970
He's alive.

303
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,730
Have you heard from him since he went off to face

304
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:25,710
Ra's al ghul?

305
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,620
He's alive.

306
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,650
If he were, I suspect you would have heard from him by now.

307
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,590
Unless Ra's took him prisoner,

308
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,930
and demon's head does not take prisoners.

309
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,050
What are you doing?

310
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,640
I'm running the pattern analysis

311
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,530
on that list of numbers you guys found.

312
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,130
No, I mean, what's the point?

313
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,500
Malcolm Merlyn didn't tell us anything we don't already know.

314
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,080
Nothing has changed.

315
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,310
You're right, Felicity.

316
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,820
He didn't tell us anything new.

317
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,990
But he may have been right all the same.

318
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,780
I know you guys think I'm in denial.

319
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,010
But if there's one thing Oliver taught me -- he taught us --

320
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,720
is that sometimes, all you can do

321
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,030
is keep pushing forward.

322
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,160
All right.

323
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,660
I've got the M.E.'s report.

324
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,940
Did they ID the body?

325
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,820
Jose Anton.

326
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,790
Career criminal with ties to Danny Brickwell.

327
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,040
I think Brick severed those ties pretty thoroughly.

328
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,160
Is everything ok?

329
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,340
Where's Oliver?

330
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,320
He went to fight the head

331
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,830
- of the League of Assassins. - What?!

332
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:45,540
And we haven't heard from him since he left.

333
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,700
There's something else--

334
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,050
Malcolm Merlyn stopped by for a little chat.

335
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,560
He says Oliver's dead.

336
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,450
And you guys believe him?

337
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,200
Look, Laurel, Merlyn said--

338
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,050
There isn't one thing that Malcolm Merlyn can say

339
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,600
that any of us should believe.

340
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,030
This isn't the first time

341
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,750
that I've heard that Oliver was dead.

342
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,690
He's been back before.

343
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,310
He'll be back again.

344
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,710
I'm in.

345
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,520
Found it!

346
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,780
Hong Kong military?

347
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,450
Triad.

348
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,940
Chien Na Wei's men.

349
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,630
Any luck?

350
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,940
The number pattern is consistent with cataloguing numerics.

351
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,340
What kind of catalog?

352
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,310
If I knew, I would be telling you.

353
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,720
I'm sorry to interrupt.

354
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,420
We really need to change the locks.

355
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,730
What do you want?

356
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,810
The League conducts matter of significance such as duels

357
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,560
on grounds sacred to its beliefs.

358
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,510
I went there.

359
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,740
And found this.

360
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,220
It's Ra's' custom to leave behind

361
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,990
the instrument of death

362
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,600
as a memorial to honor the fallen.

363
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,690
Merlyn, did you see...

364
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,870
Oliver's body?

365
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,300
It fell into a ravine.

366
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,310
His remains were unrecoverable, I'm afraid.

367
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,820
Then how do we know that's Oliver's blood?

368
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,680
Because after I leave, you'll test it.

369
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,530
And after you confirm that it is his blood,

370
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,400
you'll exhaust yourself with conspiracy theories

371
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,490
as to how I planted it or how it's all a lie.

372
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,980
And after enough time passes,

373
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,630
you'll be left with one inescapable truth--

374
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,190
that Oliver Queen is dead.

375
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,900
This is your fault.

376
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,300
Oliver went there because of you--

377
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,640
Because of what you did to Thea.

378
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,670
You made her a target for the League so

379
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,250
he would have to challenge Ra's just to save her.

380
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,530
You killed him.

381
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,220
You are right.

382
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,510
And I will live with that guilt

383
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,920
for the rest of my days.

384
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,600
I am truly sorry.

385
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,490
I can see how much you loved him.

386
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,820
Save it, Merlyn.

387
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,860
You're enjoying this.

388
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,090
Miss Smoak is correct.

389
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,230
I orchestrated the matter

390
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,030
to eliminate the death warrant

391
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,330
Ra's placed on my head.

392
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,840
Oliver was that way.

393
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,900
His death means my own.

394
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,360
Good.

395
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,600
What's that?

396
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,260
The blood analysis on the scimitar.

397
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,680
It's Oliver's.

398
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,380
99.997% match.

399
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,320
If Merlyn's lying, he's being thorough about it.

400
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,900
Felicity...

401
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,540
Thanks for not saying "I told you so."

402
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,650
I got to go to work.

403
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,610
You really don't.

404
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,880
It's fine.

405
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,090
I'm glad we know now.

407
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,190
Run for the exit! I'll cover you!

408
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,280
What about you?

409
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,170
- You get the Alpha out of here! - But--

410
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,670
Away from them! Go!

411
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,880
No.

412
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,330
You had him. Why didn't you take the shot?

413
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,830
We need to get out of here.

414
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,270
Now.

415
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,330
You know, it's weird.

416
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,540
I don't think I've ever actually seen you drink alone.

417
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,150
You OK?

418
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,900
Yeah.

419
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,280
I just got some bad news about a friend.

420
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,680
Anyone I know?

421
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,860
How are you doing?

422
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,290
Still freaking out, actually.

423
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,090
Worried about Ollie.

424
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,170
I was going to ask you a favor,

425
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,890
but it doesn't seem like the right time.

426
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,880
Well, it depends. What's the favor?

427
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,960
You and the Arrow, you're...

428
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,380
you're close, right?

429
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,730
I mean, that's you I've been seeing on the news

430
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,040
in the red hood?

431
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,690
Thea...

432
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:08,790
Look, I haven't seen him,

433
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,230
I haven't heard from him,

434
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,520
he's not answering any of my phone calls.

435
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,490
I'm actually starting to get really worried.

436
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,300
So... I thought maybe the Arrow

437
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,170
could look for Oliver?

438
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,590
I just thought maybe if you saw him,

439
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,160
you could ask.

440
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,340
Thank you. You're the best.

441
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,560
Look, I-- I better go check the stock room.

442
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,630
Thea just asked me to talk to the Arrow

443
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,850
about finding Oliver.

444
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,440
And what'd you tell her?

445
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,040
What else? I lied.

446
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,380
Oliver didn't want thea to know.

447
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,830
That was then. But now, what's the point?

448
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,850
I keep asking myself the same question, Roy.

449
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
Then why do you keep going over the case evidence?

450
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,250
Because it helps me keep my mind off of Oliver.

451
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,800
Doing this without him

452
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,110
while we're waiting for him to come back is one thing,

453
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:08,940
but doing all this without him, without him?

454
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,280
That's a whole other situation.

455
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,700
What do you want me to tell you, Roy?

456
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,630
I can only see one inch in front of me

457
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,580
and this is the only thing in front of me right now.

458
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,940
I keep looking at this file, and...

459
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,200
Something about it feels familiar.

460
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,600
Yeah. Felicity did say that

461
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,290
Fisher and Anton were connected with Brick.

462
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,450
No, it's more than that.

463
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:37,010
I've seen this file somewhere...

464
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,330
else.

466
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,410
What are the chances that's a coincidence?

467
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,010
Hey, there's only way to find out.

468
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,940
What are you doing?

469
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,000
Bringing up the case numbers

470
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,550
on the all guys we've put away over the past eight months.

471
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,340
Some of these are guys that we caught.

472
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,770
Yeah. And others were apprehended by the authorities.

473
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,200
There's a pattern here.

474
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,560
All these guys are awaiting trial

475
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:06,510
for assault -- assault with intent, murder,

476
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,390
attempted murder.

477
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,130
Street enforcers. Muscle.

478
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,450
Why would Brick have a list of these case numbers?

479
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,950
'm sure you're wondering if I ever go home.

480
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,300
Unfortunately for my assistant, the answer's no.

481
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,670
Any luck with our nanite problems?

482
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,450
No.

483
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah, it's the transplex interface, isn't it?

484
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,500
I knew my designs were off.

485
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,940
It won't... work.

486
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,710
Yeah, well, you've only been at it for a day, so.

487
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,560
Not the chip.

488
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,690
Not your suit.

489
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,850
Your plan.

490
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,670
It won't work.

491
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,740
You -- you make it sound like

492
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,610
using an enhanced exoskeleton to fight crime and save the city

493
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,830
is a loony tune idea.

494
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,570
It won't bring her back.

495
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,520
Anna.

496
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,530
Your fiancee.

497
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,830
I know who she is.

498
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,300
She's not coming back.

499
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,010
When we lose... someone,

500
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,330
when someone dies,

501
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,020
they're gone.

502
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,390
Forever, and there is nothing--

503
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,550
there is nothing

504
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,020
nothing that we can do that is going to bring them back.

505
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,560
So you have to stop. You have to stop,

506
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,910
because it's not what Anna would have wanted. It's--

507
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,340
You're upset. I can see that.

508
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,280
And if you want, we can talk about it.

509
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,020
But never tell me again what Anna would have wanted.

510
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,570
You don't get to do that.

511
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,880
I am sorry.

512
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,260
I shouldn't...

513
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,020
be here right now.

514
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,830
What?

515
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,180
We got something on Brick.

516
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,420
The blueprints we found?

517
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,040
They're schematics for the warehouse where the police store

518
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,950
all their physical evidence and active cases.

519
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,350
And Brick has a list of case numbers.

520
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,180
We think he might be looking to steal or destroy evidence

521
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,660
to get those cases thrown out of court.

522
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,170
Yeah. I'll call Lance, tell him.

523
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,060
A lot of these cases are on guys

524
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,610
who were put away within the past eight months.

525
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,600
This is everything we've been doing since we took Slade down.

526
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,120
This is everything Oliver was working for.

527
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,640
I'll be right there.

529
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,420
Three minutes.

530
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,020
Seal off every exit.

531
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,360
Give me a two block perimeter.

532
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,840
John, shooter at your five.

533
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,400
I'm out!

534
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,130
Here, use mine.

535
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,430
So here's the deal--

536
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,440
You take me down, you walk out alive.

537
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,960
I don't fancy your chances, though.

538
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,550
Smart man.

539
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,250
Nobody thinks about going for a head shot.

540
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,030
Shots fired! I need ESU and back-up here, now!

541
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,450
Felicity!

542
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,170
Where's Diggle? I'm pinned down!

543
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,890
Felicity!

544
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,670
Felicity!

545
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,730
Any... last... words?

546
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,820
Or are my hands too tight around your neck?

547
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,630
I guess arrows work a little better on this guy than bullets.

548
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,580
You OK?

549
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,790
Yeah, I will be, after we find the son of a bitch.

550
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,950
Damn it!

551
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,110
Oh, my God, John!

552
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,400
It's OK, it's all right, I'm fine. I'm fine.

553
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,690
Brick?

554
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,520
Got away. They put one guard in the hospital

555
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,710
on the way out, but he's going to pull through.

556
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,240
If that door hadn't shut, we would have had him.

557
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,230
Just bad luck.

558
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,910
Unless it wasn't.

559
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,190
You were pinned down. You both were.

560
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,220
They were going to kill you!

561
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,210
Felicity...

562
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,710
You did that?

563
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,580
They had machine guns. You had a bow and arrow.

564
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,680
You let him get away?

565
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,700
I saved your lives.

566
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,640
Felicity, it wasn't your call to make.

567
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,850
It wasn't my call to let Oliver go challenge Ra's Al Ghul

568
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,320
to a fight to the death, either!

569
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,860
Brick has who knows how much evidence, Felicity.

570
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,620
And it was either that or the two of you.

571
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,730
My friends being killed. So I made my choice.

572
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,930
I chose not to let anyone else I care about die.

573
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,050
We've been in tough spots before

574
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,300
and we've always managed to come out on the other side.

575
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,690
No.

576
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,820
Oliver did.

577
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,540
But he's not here anymore,

578
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,480
Because he's dead.

579
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:14,800
OK.

580
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,730
The point is,

581
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,020
if we're going to do this without Oliver,

582
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,040
Felicity, we have to trust each other.

583
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,160
You don't get it.

584
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,410
There is no "this" without him.

585
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:34,980
It's done. I'm done.

586
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,060
I'm sorry.

587
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,670
But I have no one else to turn to.

588
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,720
And he needs your help.

590
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,280
I was out of line.

591
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,240
And I'm sorry.

592
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,510
You want to tell me what had you so upset?

593
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,810
I lost a friend of mine.

594
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,700
He was more than a friend, actually.

595
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,610
He was...

596
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,780
I'm not sure what we were,

597
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,830
but... he's gone.

598
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,770
I'm sorry.

599
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,810
And three months ago, another friend of mine died.

600
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,980
I'm 25 years old.

601
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:06,770
I'm over my quota where losing my friends are concerned.

602
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,780
And you're a friend.

603
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,920
So if you want to go out there,

604
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,250
if you want to commit suicide,

605
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,510
I can't stop you.

606
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,090
But I don't have to help you.

608
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,770
Eight months to put him away...

609
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,320
eight minutes to set him loose.

610
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,500
I'm sorry.

611
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,540
I tried.

612
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,330
Without the evidence,

613
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,450
the judge had to let them go.

614
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,570
He's not coming back.

615
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,310
Oliver.

616
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,310
I know you don't want to believe it, Laurel.

617
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,720
God knows I don't, but...

618
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,020
he's not coming back.

619
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,100
Are you?

620
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,970
Are you coming back?

621
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,380
I don't know.

622
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,890
For the first time since I met Oliver Queen...

623
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,590
I don't know what happens next.

624
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,570
I know it's silly, but I...

625
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,800
still like to think of myself as Oliver's bodyguard.

626
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,180
I just couldn't protect him.

627
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,770
It's funny.

628
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,370
He was worried something would happen to me.

629
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,910
I could have killed you!

630
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,800
It's cute that you think so.

631
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,440
Did you hear anything about Ollie?

632
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,900
I'm afraid not.

633
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,950
Then what are you doing here?

634
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,330
We're in danger, Thea.

635
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,200
We need to leave Starling City and never return.

636
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,680
Thank you all for coming.

637
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,200
But seeing as I'm the reason

638
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,510
none of you are sitting in a prison cell right now,

639
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,670
I figure it's the least you can do.

640
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,520
I know I'm the guy that

641
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,820
made all the evidence against you go away,

642
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,330
But as you can see,

643
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,930
it didn't go too far.

644
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,560
You are all part of my crew now.

645
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,290
And if any of you have a problem with that,

646
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,270
I can send a gift wrapped package to the D.A.

647
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,870
Together, not only will we make a lot of money,

648
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,030
we will make history.

649
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,750
Together,

650
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,860
we are going to take over the glades.

651
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,810
You think Brick's crazy?

652
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,520
Take over a whole section of town?

653
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,010
I know he's crazy.

654
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,820
I don't know what he's got planned,

655
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,470
But whatever it is, I'm in.

656
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,040
Who the hell are you?

657
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,190
I'm the justice you can't run from.

658
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,260
Well done, Mr. Queen.

659
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,980
I'm glad to know my investment in you hasn't entirely been for naught.

660
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,480
Although I was disappointed to read

661
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,950
Agent Pierson's after action report.

662
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,080
You let one of Chien Na Wei's men get away.

663
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,430
I hesitated. It was a mistake.

664
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,510
It really was.

665
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,960
Now we have no one to interrogate.

666
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,300
You mean torture, right?

667
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,090
I saw you with that man.

668
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,210
You didn't hesitate.

669
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,630
You chose not to shoot him.

670
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,340
I put the GPS from the vial in his pocket.

671
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,710
And now he is going to lead us right to Tatsu.

672
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,030
You're going to get her back, Maseo.

673
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,480
I promise.

674
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,500
Oliver...

675
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,170
what you've done,

676
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,900
I will be forever in your debt.

677
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,250
Don't move.

678
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,160
You'll pull out the sutures.

679
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,770
Oliver.

680
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,480
Tatsu.

681
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,900
How...

682
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,720
I asked her to come here...

683
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,590
so she could bring you back to life.
