15
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,520
My name is Oliver Queen.

16
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,400
After five years in hell,

17
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,620
I have come home with only one goal,

18
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:10,070
to save my city.

19
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,390
Now others have joined my crusade.

20
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,780
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

21
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,210
To the rest of Starling City,

22
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,110
I am someone else.

23
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,290
I am something else.

24
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,090
Previously, on "Arrow"...

25
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:25,740
My sister. She was murdered.

26
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,830
And I can't tell anyone.

27
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,300
See, before, Laurel, you were swinging at your sister's killer.

28
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,850
Don't train for that. All right, train for yourself.

29
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,130
The serum that you were exposed to,

30
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,100
it changes your body but it also warps your mind.

31
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,740
You're not moving very quickly this morning.

32
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,340
I just didn't sleep much last night.

33
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,830
What are you doing here?

34
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,650
Roy!

35
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,920
Where'd you go?

36
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,350
Sorry.

37
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,330
Get your head in the game.

38
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,600
We're in position.

39
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,320
So is the Culebra Cartel and their gazillion pounds of heroin.

40
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,050
They all showed up about 30 minutes ago

41
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,050
and they haven't moved from your location.

42
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,270
Copy that.

43
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,270
No sentries outside.

44
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,350
If we're going to do this, we need to do it now.

45
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,240
I've got north entrance, Dig's got south.

46
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,940
- Roy. - East.

47
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,340
The roof.

48
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,760
You're on over watch.

49
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,690
The Culebras get their weapons from the Bratva.

50
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,360
All military grade.

51
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:27,870
I've got your backs.

52
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,870
Let's do this.

53
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,950
South is clear.

54
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,900
Nobody's home.

55
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,450
Roof's clear.

56
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,560
North is empty, too.

57
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,850
That doesn't make sense. They all showed up

58
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,090
half an hour ago and never left.

59
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,500
They are in there somewhere.

60
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,460
Looks like somebody beat us here.

61
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,730
There's at least a few million dollars worth of heroin.

63
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,000
He took Paco.

64
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,280
Whoever did this ignored the drugs,

65
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,510
took a gang member.

66
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,550
This was personal.

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,850
Yeah, more than that.

68
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,090
Whoever did this was trying to send a message.

69
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,530
I think I know what it is.

72
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,640
Guilty. Well, yeah.

73
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,980
The Culebras are the bloodiest gang in Starling.

74
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,130
Who's the second bloodiest?

75
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,580
Culebras have a long standing rivalry with the Los Halcones.

76
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,500
Thought you said this was personal, not business.

77
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,640
And Paco?

78
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,490
There are only 86,000 Pacos in Starling,

79
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,220
give or take 5,000 for a few nicknames.

80
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,610
Something tells me that the Culebra's

81
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,660
long standing rivals will narrow that down for us.

82
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,150
You know, when we find Paco, he'll be too dead to say anything.

83
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,800
I'm not looking for him. I'm looking for whoever did this.

84
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,370
I will handle this.

85
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,500
Take the rest of the night.

86
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,170
I'll back you up.

87
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,900
Not dead on your feet, you won't.

88
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,600
I'm sorry. I know I've been a little out of it recently.

89
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,410
Don't be sorry. Be rested.

90
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,430
I wouldn't be much of a teacher

91
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,100
if I let you get killed because your reaction time is slow, ok?

92
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,560
Dig.

93
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,050
There are a lot of Halcones members in Starling City.

94
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,130
How about I take the ones north of Tenth Street.

95
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,070
You know, we've been waiting here an hour.

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,790
After walking around the block five times.

97
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,790
We need to work on your patience.

98
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,350
Where is this guy? And more importantly,

99
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,800
how is he going to help us find out what this

100
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,430
China white person is--

101
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,590
- Chien Na Wei. - Whatever!

102
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,460
How is he going to help

103
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,800
us find out what she's doing in Hong Kong?

104
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,080
Waller hasn't been able to locate Chien Na Wei

105
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,070
because she avoids using any traceable forms of communication.

106
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,850
So he's the target now?

107
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,770
He's her delivery guy.

108
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,170
Her courier. But he's not a target.

109
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,670
Waller doesn't want you to kill him.

110
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,210
That's refreshing.

111
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,470
They'll use a dead drop.

112
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,740
Leave behind information for Chien's network.

113
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,220
Information Waller intercepts.

114
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,290
I see him.

115
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,870
Stay on bluetooth.

116
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,240
I'll be right behind you.

117
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,910
What was that?

118
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,040
Did he make you?

119
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,960
Yeah, I think he did.

120
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,480
He's gone. Where is it?

121
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,340
- Where's what? - The envelope.

122
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,290
The message. We need it!

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,380
He must have stashed it somewhere

124
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,610
while you were chasing him.

125
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,250
I didn't see him stash anything!

126
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,770
Yes, you did.

127
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,540
You just don't know it yet.

128
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,650
That's not bad.

129
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,400
Yeah. It's better than not bad.

130
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,380
What the hell was that?!

131
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,170
Today's lesson.

132
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,350
Fighting's about being surprised and not getting rattled.

133
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,590
You look rattled.

134
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,930
Try angry.

135
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,950
Another lesson, then.

136
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,510
It's not about you getting knocked to the mat.

137
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,760
It's if you get up.

138
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,410
Okay, fine.

139
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,230
Then let's go again.

140
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,190
Not tonight. All right?

141
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,490
I got to close up shop.

142
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,680
And you need to get some rest.

143
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,760
Let those muscles recover.

144
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,030
Make sure you get some protein within the hour, all right?

145
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,500
Yeah, egg whites. They're my new bff.

146
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,060
Oh, that's disgusting.

147
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,210
No, no, no, two blocks from here--

148
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,910
Korean tacos.

149
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
- Korean tacos? - Trust me.

150
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,980
They're heaven. Come on, I'm buying.

151
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,230
Can I ask you a question?

152
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,410
You just did.

153
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,770
Kidding. What?

154
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,590
You know how to do a blood test, right?

155
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,910
I know just enough to make me dangerous.

156
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,640
And, well, me holding a syringe,

157
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,300
well, that makes me more dangerous.

158
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,880
Why?

159
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,990
I need you to test my blood.

160
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,220
For what? And don't say STDS,

161
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,320
because that would be crossing a line.

162
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,220
For Mirakuru.

163
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,870
I don't need to check you for traces of Mirakuru.

164
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,130
You were cured.

165
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,860
I know, I--

166
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,370
If this is about your sleep problems,

167
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,570
Mirakuru makes people crazy strong

168
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,560
and crazy crazy. It doesn't make it hard for them to get 8 hours.

169
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,610
Could you just...

170
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,770
Are you ok?

171
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,580
I mean, besides the whole not sleeping thing.

172
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,120
Totally. I'm fine.

173
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,330
I'm just looking for reasons to help me sleep, you know?

174
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,590
Ok.

175
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,400
I'm looking for a crew member named Paco.

176
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,850
- Emilio? - Paco!

177
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,660
That's what they call him, ese!

178
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,560
- Paco's his street name! - Who?!

179
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,960
Emilio.

180
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,980
Emilio Ortega.

181
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,710
Thank you.

182
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,390
Felicity, I have a name.

183
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,470
Emilio Ortega.

184
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,310
Pinging his cell's GPS.

186
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,140
He's in the Glades. Ninth and Hasen.

188
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,050
Why'd you kill all those men?

189
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,020
What the hell are you talking about?

190
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,940
What are you doing?!

191
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,540
Get out of here.

192
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,850
Oh, my God.

193
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,220
Now, Laurel!

194
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,360
No!

195
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,100
Ted didn't do this. Ted's been with me

196
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,680
for the past two hours. He trained with me,

197
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,110
and then we went for dinner.

198
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,560
And that...

199
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,580
He wasn't here when we left.

201
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,720
Ok, that is ten minutes of my life I am never getting back.

202
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,630
I'm clean?

203
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,670
Your cholesterol is a little high for someone of your age,

204
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,220
but absolutely zero Mirakuru serum.

205
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,430
Congratulations.

206
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,240
Thank God.

207
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,910
Ok, you're acting like I just told you

208
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,890
that the biopsy came back negative.

209
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,610
What is going on?

210
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,110
It's--it's stupid.

211
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,080
You just had me test your blood

212
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,340
for a serum you were cured of six months ago.

213
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,350
I already knew it was stupid.

214
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,580
The reason I haven't been sleeping

215
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,340
is 'cause I've been having dreams,

216
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,070
and not normal ones.

217
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,420
It was like I was remembering the time I was out, you know?

218
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,640
When Slade oded me on the Mirakuru.

219
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,060
What do you remember?

220
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,570
Nothing much. Just a feeling.

221
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,970
A feeling of being...

222
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,420
not me.

223
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,760
And being strong and out of control,

224
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,060
but here's the thing,

225
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,940
In those dreams...

226
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,630
I killed Sara.

227
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,090
This really had you worried?

228
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,420
Because the dreams, they didn't feel like dreams, Felicity.

229
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,160
They felt like memories.

230
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,920
I actually remembered throwing arrows into her.

231
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,090
Crazy, right?

232
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,970
Yeah.

233
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,380
Crazy.

234
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,830
So that's it?

235
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,420
I was with him the whole time.

236
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,140
You can put me on the box if you'd like.

237
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,530
If I wanted to give my daughter a polygraph,

238
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,500
I'd have done it back when you discovered beer.

239
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,650
So listen, what's the story

240
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:36,090
with you and this guy, anyway?

241
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,490
He's just my trainer.

242
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,760
- Who you went to dinner with? - As friends.

243
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,290
But I know him, and he would never do something like this.

244
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,160
Well, we've got to hold him here

245
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,090
till the coroner's official findings come back,

246
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,630
and then if they're consistent with his story,

247
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,920
we'll cut him loose.

248
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,010
It's like I said.

249
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,430
He didn't do it.

250
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,370
Why would a mass murderer string up a body in his gym?

251
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,790
Ted caters to a pretty rough clientele.

252
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,910
A lot of career criminals,

253
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,190
gangbangers.

254
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,930
He runs afoul of one every now and again.

255
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,270
He thinks someone was trying to send him a message.

256
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,260
- Who? - He says he doesn't know.

257
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,340
I want to talk to him.

258
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,100
About this case, or me?

259
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,570
Two weeks ago, I said I wouldn't train you to fight.

260
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,690
Now you have a trainer.

261
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,910
Who's training me to box, to let off some steam.

262
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,390
I think I have a pretty good reason to have some.

263
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,260
Keep your eyes open with this guy.

264
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,540
He didn't do this.

265
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,620
Just the same.

266
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,740
Why are you sitting like that?

267
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,070
I'm concentrating.

268
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,310
Why?

269
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,770
- Because I need to remember something. - Why?

270
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,830
Try this.

271
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,470
Pay attention.

272
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,310
Remember where the matching one is?

273
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,060
See, your memory's fine.

274
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,560
He needs your help.

275
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,280
You need my help.

276
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,550
You know I don't like your friend.

277
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,010
This gaijin, he is trouble.

278
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,860
Well, I need him to remember what he saw.

279
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,450
When we capture Chien Na Wei, my debt is paid.

280
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,240
All I care about

281
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,440
is us getting home.

282
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,840
Then help me.

283
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,750
I love you.

284
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,870
You know that, right?

285
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,090
Oh, come on, you must be cheating.

286
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,920
I'm just better at this than you.

287
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,490
Akio.

289
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,600
We were just playing a game.

290
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,350
Mr. Queen.

291
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,870
I will house you, feed you, and clothe you.

292
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,090
But my son is off limits.

293
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,610
Fine.

294
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,900
Stay!

295
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,470
What are you doing?

296
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,310
I'm helping you.

297
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,350
Now...

298
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,690
Do exactly as I say.

299
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,300
You ever heard of this Ted Grant?

300
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,330
Yeah, I saw his title fight a few years back on pay per view.

301
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,450
They call him Wild Cat. He's the real deal.

302
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,040
Body in his gym was strung up the same way

304
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,900
that the bodies in the warehouse were.

305
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,690
Like punching bags.

306
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,930
What if Laurel vouches for him?

307
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,810
I don't think that Laurel is seeing clearly on this one.

308
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,490
If Grant's our doer, he's more than boxer.

309
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,720
I hacked CSU's files on the warehouse murders.

310
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,090
The Culebras were armed to the teeth,

311
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,990
but the killer, the psycho mass murder guy,

312
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,440
Never fired a shot.

313
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,140
They were beaten to death by brass knuckles.

314
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,680
It's a pretty specific M.O.

315
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,310
It matches one murder from six years ago.

316
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,710
Same as tonight, Culebra drug dealer.

317
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,550
Blunt force trauma, consistent with brass knuckles

318
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,800
worn by a left-handed assailant.

319
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,350
Let me guess-- Ted "Wild Cat" Grant's a lefty.

320
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,070
They called him the Starling southpaw.

321
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,990
Well, SCPD never put that together,

322
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,820
because Ted was never arrested.

323
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,950
He's moving.

324
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,560
You dinged him with a tracer?

325
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,150
Just because Laurel trusts him doesn't mean I have to.

326
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,540
Talk me in.

329
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,930
Second time I've found you with a body!

330
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:06,060
I've never killed anybody. I'm being set up.

331
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,650
Why should I believe you?!

332
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,580
Because I used to be a vigilante.

333
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,090
I used to be you.

334
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,970
The city has been hurt long before you showed up.

335
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,520
I've never heard of another vigilante in Starling.

336
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,030
It was six years ago.

337
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,100
I wasn't news-- I stuck to the Glades.

338
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,230
And these are supposed to convince me?

339
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,600
Masks are also useful for serial killers.

340
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,370
Says a guy currently wearing one.

341
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,920
Who's that?

342
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,010
I don't know. I've never seen him before in my life.

343
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,350
But this was hung around the body

344
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,870
that was found in my gym.

345
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,630
The key is to the storage locker.

347
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,250
He's leaving me a trail to follow.

348
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,520
Who is?

349
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,030
Whoever's setting me up.

350
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,810
Look, I've never killed anyone.

351
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,870
Except for that drug dealer that you beat to death six years ago.

352
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,080
That was a mistake.

353
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,420
I may have avoided jail, but I have lived

354
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,780
with the guilt of that man's death

355
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,400
every single day of my life.

356
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,830
I gave it all up after that.

357
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,860
I locked this place up and I swore I'd never open it again.

358
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,290
Who else knows about the locker?

359
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,410
No one.

360
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,210
This is where I kept my supplies.

361
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,240
A safe place separate from my day job.

362
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,960
I'm sure you've got one just like it.

363
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,240
Mine's bigger.

364
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,570
Look, we're both trying to find out

365
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:29,850
who the hell's doing this.

366
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,660
We could help each other.

367
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,490
His name is Albert Mancini.

368
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,320
No criminal record,

369
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,260
aside from a few unpaid parking tickets.

370
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,090
Grant says he doesn't know who this guy is.

371
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,630
- Oh, and now you believe him? - I haven't decided yet!

372
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,040
Do you know that you're training with a vigilante?

373
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,260
Former, apparently.

374
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,280
And no, I didn't.

375
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,380
I didn't!

376
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,410
So you also didn't know

377
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,900
that six years ago, he beat someone to death?

378
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,640
How many more reasons

379
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,000
am I going to have to give you

380
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,310
before you stay away from this guy?

381
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,870
Ok, you know what,

382
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,350
are you guys just about finished with your little private chat?

383
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,180
The guy from your storage unit,

384
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,750
he has no criminal record.

385
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,730
He was a magician.

386
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,650
Magician's assistant, more accurately.

387
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,250
He worked with a local act before getting cut loose.

388
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
Mancini hasn't worked since.

389
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,120
Culebra Cartel, magician's assistant.

390
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,480
What's the connection?

392
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,200
Their act was at the Sansa Bar.

393
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,700
The Sansa Bar's where's the drug dealer was murdered.

394
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,600
You mean the person you beat to death?

395
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,990
I told you--

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,790
whoever's doing this

397
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,190
is leaving me a trail to follow.

398
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,410
Then we follow it.

399
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,780
We need another minute.

400
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,750
How do you two know each other?

401
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,990
We used to date.

402
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,660
You cannot be serious.

403
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,770
I am not on your team.

404
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,840
I don't work for you.

405
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,570
Exactly. You're untrained.

406
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,940
Oh, who's fault is that?

407
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,120
Does he know?

408
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,490
What's driving you?

409
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,380
I told him...

410
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,730
that Sara's gone.

411
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,090
But does he know

412
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,300
that you want to follow in her footsteps?

413
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,370
You're playing a very dangerous game, Laurel.

414
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,520
I can handle it.

415
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,940
No, you can't.

416
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,460
Because you haven't realized

417
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,980
that it's not actually a game.

418
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,050
Let's go.

419
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,140
What about Laurel?

420
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,510
She's not coming.

421
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,840
Oliver has a 20 on our killer.

422
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,660
I thought Oliver was tracking Grant.

423
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,910
Looks like things have changed.

424
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,870
Suit up, he wants us to provide back-up.

425
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,930
- Roy can't go. - What?

426
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,630
I need to talk to you about something important.

427
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,910
- It can wait. - No, it can't. John?

428
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,950
I'll take care of it.

429
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,830
What the hell is that about?

430
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,230
We need to talk.

431
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,690
Yeah, you made that pretty clear.

432
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,220
Before we buried Sara,

433
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,350
I scanned her body using portable magnetic resonance imaging.

434
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,990
Felicity, you're really starting to freak me out.

435
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,740
I basically created a virtual autopsy.

436
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,730
It's not as good as a regular autopsy,

437
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,750
but like when I can use it to determine things

438
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,840
an autopsy would,

439
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,540
like angle of tack, trajectory,

440
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,440
and the force of the arrows.

441
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,720
Felicity, what are you saying?

442
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,180
There were certain things about the forensics

443
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,400
that I couldn't reconcile with,

444
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,250
specifically,

445
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,780
the angle and the velocity of the arrows were not consistent

446
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,280
with a normal bow or archer of normal height.

447
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,290
But if the arrows were thrown with mirakuru force...

448
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,250
What if there was some residual mirakuru in your system?

449
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,470
It would explain the forensics.

450
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,100
The angle and the force of the arrows.

451
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,510
But you said that I tested negative for mirakuru.

452
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,940
There isn't any in your blood today,

453
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,710
but if one last mirakuru episode

454
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
burned down any remnants in your system...

455
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,060
"Episode?"

456
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,630
You mean...

457
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,410
me killing Sara.

458
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,210
I'm onsite.

459
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,180
Copy. Keep watching the perimeter.

460
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,310
How many partners do you have, anyway?

461
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,350
The Culebras.

462
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,660
The body in your gym,

463
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,830
the body in your storage locker.

464
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,890
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble to frame you for murders

465
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,840
and bring you here.

466
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,560
Why?

467
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,230
What does all this have to do with one killing six years ago?

468
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,470
Hello, Ted.

469
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,520
I see you got my messages.

470
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,270
Arrows.

471
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,920
Brass knuckles.

472
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,530
I never knew

473
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,720
why we couldn't just use a gun the way they did.

474
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,250
Because we're better than they are.

475
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,650
At least we're supposed to be.

476
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,810
That's almost ironic, coming from you.

477
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,550
I trusted you!

478
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,550
SCPD!

479
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,880
Ted Grant,

480
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,450
you are under arrest for multiple counts of homicide.

481
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,330
What are you talkin' about?

482
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,350
- I didn't do this. - Yeah?

483
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,650
Tell that to the stiff we found in your locker.

484
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,910
Let's go.

486
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,140
Sorry he got past me.

487
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,520
He knew an exit out of the building

488
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,640
that wasn't on any of the blueprints

489
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,160
that Felicity hooked me up with.

490
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,330
You had Ted Grant arrested?

491
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,360
Your father's men found him at a crime scene.

492
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,980
Another body was found at a storage locker that he owns,

493
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,270
along with evidence of past vigilantism.

494
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,150
- No. He's innocent. - I know.

495
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,870
I saw the person who's doing this.

496
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,930
Who is it?

497
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,670
He was wearing Ted's old gear. Full face mask.

498
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,860
Let's go.

499
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,770
Clearly Grant knows who's behind the mask.

500
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,000
Oliver.

501
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,690
Laurel. I...

502
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,730
What's up?

503
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,250
I have to--

504
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,050
Roy, don't. Let's just--

505
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,720
I need to tell you something.

506
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,850
Ok?

507
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,350
I...

508
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,230
I killed Sara.

509
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,250
That doesn't...

510
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,740
You're not making any sense.

511
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,400
Why would you kill Sara?

512
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,760
It was the Mirakuru.

513
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,780
Roy had no memory of the attack.

514
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,890
No real memory, at least. But he's been recalling

515
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,660
fragments of his Mirakuru exposure last year.

516
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,930
That, and suppressed memories often resurface in dreams.

517
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,110
This is insane.

518
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,320
Laurel, I am so sorry. I'm really--

519
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,550
Don't!

520
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,550
Wait, Roy, where do you think you're going?

521
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,080
Let him go.

522
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,140
I thought he was cured.

523
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,820
What we know about Mirakuru is vastly outweighed

524
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,240
by the things we don't know.

525
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,220
What does that even mean?

526
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:58,240
That Roy killed my sister and it's not his fault?

527
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,330
The arrows that killed Sara,

528
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,360
we pulled D.N.A. off of them, didn't we?

529
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,330
I tested it against the sample of Roy's blood.

530
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,380
It was the first thing I did.

531
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,460
And?

532
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,840
The results were inconclusive.

533
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,580
I can't process this right now.

534
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,050
Look at me.

535
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,660
Focus on what you can process.

536
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,110
Ted knows who we're coming after.

537
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,180
I need you to find out who it is.

538
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,360
I can't. I can't.

539
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,070
If Roy killed Sara, then--

540
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,180
If Roy killed Sara, then...

541
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,770
We will deal with it.

542
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,420
For right now, I need you to deal with Ted.

543
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,120
Ok?

544
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,320
Ok.

545
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,350
How sure are you?

546
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,900
There's other forensic evidence.

547
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,990
A virtual autopsy, in light of what Roy's described,

548
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,400
it sounds incriminating.

549
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,190
That, and his trouble

550
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,670
sleeping started right when Sara was killed.

551
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,990
My husband says you are having problems

552
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,190
remembering what you saw earlier today.

553
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,020
That's the problem.

554
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,400
I didn't see anything.

555
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,660
You see and hear far more than you think.

556
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,900
Hidden truths,

557
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,860
very deep in your sub-conscious.

558
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,990
You saw something, but your head is too busy.

559
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,720
You need to quiet it.

560
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,590
Close your eyes.

561
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,840
Take a deep breath.

562
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,350
In through your nose, out through your mouth.

563
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,800
In...

564
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,630
and out.

565
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,560
And again.

566
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,780
You're floating, in nothingness.

567
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,890
All that exists is your breath.

568
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,670
Any thoughts you have are clouds.

569
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,730
They just drift away.

570
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,680
I remember.

571
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,190
16 murders.

572
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,800
17, counting the one from six years ago.

573
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,210
That's more than the son of Sam, less than Bundy.

575
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,590
Probably worth a mini-series, huh? Maybe a book?

576
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,060
You became a defense attorney?

577
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,410
Can I talk to him for a minute?

578
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,030
You sure can pick 'em.

579
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,910
You ok?

580
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,370
I'm not the one facing a lifetime in prison.

581
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,350
Who framed you?

582
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,320
I don't know.

583
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,210
I can't help you if you're going to keep lying to me.

584
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,520
The arrow saw you with him. He knows you know who it is.

585
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,000
If the D.A.'s office refuses to seek an indictment,

586
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,920
the police have to release you.

587
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,120
But first...

588
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,090
I'm going to need you to be straight with me.

589
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,800
Who was the man behind the mask?

590
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,320
His name's Isaac Stanzler.

591
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,040
Six years ago, the Culebras ran the Glades.

592
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,880
I thought it would be a good idea for families

593
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,670
to be able to live there

594
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,010
without worrying about their kids getting shot.

595
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,930
So I decided to do something about it.

596
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,430
You became a vigilante.

597
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,550
Just like your friend in the green hood--

598
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,800
without the green hood.

599
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,020
And what about Stanzler?

600
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,890
You know the guy the arrow's been running around with lately?

601
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,420
The one in red?

602
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,190
Stanzler was my guy in red.

603
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,350
I guess you can call him my apprentice.

604
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,090
And one night, we decided to go after

605
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,850
this drug dealer that was pushing crank near the school.

606
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,840
We tracked him all the way to this nightclub.

607
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,500
And what happened?

608
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
That drug dealer...

609
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,350
Isaac got to him first.

610
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,200
That murder from six years ago...

611
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,320
That wasn't you, that was him.

612
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,000
I hung it up after that.

613
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,680
What about Stanzler?

614
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,930
What happened to Isaac Stanzler?

615
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,830
I told him to get the hell out of Starling.

616
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,810
That I never wanted to see his face ever again.

617
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,120
I cut him loose.

618
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,100
That's why I've been lying to you this whole time, Laurel.

619
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,200
Everything that's happening is my fault.

620
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,600
No word from Laurel?

621
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,390
Not yet.

622
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,090
But according to SCPD email traffic,

623
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,310
which I may or may not have hacked into,

624
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,550
they are dropping the charges against Ted Grant.

625
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,450
Oliver, let me go after Roy.

626
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,470
If he's experiencing Mirakuru side effects,

627
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,780
we can't leave him running around.

628
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,140
So you bring him in.

629
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,890
Then what?

630
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,700
Oliver, this crusade of ours,

631
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,880
it's supposed to be about justice, right?

632
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,020
So if that's supposed to mean something,

633
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,060
we can't have two sets of rules--

634
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,700
one for the bad guys and one for us.

635
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,550
I'm the one who brought Roy into this crusade.

636
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,180
And maybe it's time for you to cut him loose.

637
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,640
Are you telling me to abandon him?

638
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,070
Yes, Oliver.

639
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,840
If that's what it takes to find justice for Sara.

640
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,780
So what do you think Stanzler's next move is?

641
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,300
Well, framing me didn't work.

642
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm almost afraid to think of

643
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,980
what he might try to do next.

644
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,970
What I should have done from the start.

645
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,890
After you abandoned me, the Culebra family,

646
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,330
they wanted payback for the man they lost.

647
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:21,390
They tortured me for months before I escaped.

648
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,960
Isaac, I'm so sorry.

649
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,530
I didn't know.

650
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,640
But come on, let's talk about this.

651
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,110
Oh, don't worry, we will.

652
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,630
There's so much I have to say before I kill you.

653
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,090
Where are we going?

654
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,370
Just drive!

655
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,110
Your beef is with me.

656
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,790
Ok, you got me.

657
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,660
Let her go.

658
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,980
Taking innocent people hostage?

659
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,590
Man, I taught you better than that.

660
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:59,150
They're not people, they're criminals.

661
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,690
Albert Mancini wasn't.

662
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,150
You still strung him up in that nightclub.

663
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,590
You taught me that there are no innocents

664
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,750
when you abandoned me to the Culebras.

665
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,760
You gave me direction, purpose.

666
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,640
And then when things got tough,

667
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,300
when I really needed you,

668
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,540
you weren't there.

669
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,590
It's Laurel.

670
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,220
Put her on speaker.

671
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,030
I hated you so much for that.

672
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,140
That voice, that's him.

673
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,910
I was just a kid,OK?

674
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,660
You were supposed to know better.

675
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,100
Call's coming from Laurel's cell.

676
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,780
Moving fast, 45 miles an hour.

677
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,990
They're in her car.

678
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,600
They're headed north on Route 17.

679
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,870
Keep that line open.

680
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,310
Isaac, I'm sorry.

681
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,400
I had no idea!

682
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,780
Eyes on the road!

683
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,620
Don't stop!

684
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,400
Who was that?

685
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,910
- Who was that?! - I don't know.

686
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,970
The only friend I ever had was you.

687
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,120
Another vigilante.

688
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,320
Looks like we started a movement.

689
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,550
Go, go, go!

690
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,440
Get Grant!

691
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,100
Get Laurel.

692
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,580
Don't you get it? He's using you!

693
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,420
You're not a human being, man.

694
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,210
You were just another weapon in his arsenal.

695
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,810
And the second you do something wrong,

696
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,310
he'll turn his back on you.

697
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,170
He will abandon you!

698
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,920
I'm not you.

699
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,040
Don't abandon me.

700
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,610
Never.

701
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,180
You planning on hiding in the shadows all night?

702
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,590
That's a good trick.

703
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,830
Used it once or twice myself back in the day.

704
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,760
Thank you.

705
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,620
You can thank me by doing something for me.

706
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,820
Name it.

707
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,580
Stay away from Laurel Lance.

708
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,420
She's in a vulnerable place

709
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,290
and I don't want her getting hurt.

710
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,750
Did you bother asking what she wants?

711
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,330
Cause that's her choice.

712
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,730
If she stops coming, that's fine.

713
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,190
She'll stop coming.

714
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,540
You know, you did me a solid,

715
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,150
so let me repay you with a little hard won advice.

716
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,230
Learn from my mistake--

717
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,870
What I did, what you do...

718
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,080
this playing judge and jury,

719
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,400
it messes with people's heads.

720
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,570
It messed with Isaac's;

721
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,730
I just waited till it was too late to cut him loose.

722
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:16,910
Don't make the same mistake

723
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,670
with the kid you're running around with.

724
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Ted, your mistake wasn't cutting him loose...

725
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,940
it was losing faith in him.

727
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,520
How are you feeling?

728
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,510
The worst part about sobriety

729
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,590
is having to pass on the pain meds.

730
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,560
Right.

731
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,320
I thought maybe you could use a ride home.

732
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:49,760
And an "I told you so?"

733
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,600
I don't think that I owe you one of those.

734
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,850
When I said I wouldn't train you,

735
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,660
I was trying to protect you.

736
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,560
But a homicidal former vigilante apprentice

737
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,070
was not what I had in mind.

738
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,460
I know you're trying to protect me, Ollie,

739
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,730
but I'm not helpless.

740
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,650
I've never seen you that way.

741
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:13,800
But Laurel, I'm always going to watch out for you.

742
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,150
It's not because I think you're helpless.

743
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,540
It's because I care about you.

744
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,260
And what about Roy?

745
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,830
Do you trust me?

746
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,080
I'm going to miss this.

747
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,390
I feel like I was just starting to get good at it.

748
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,520
You are getting good at it.

749
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,410
That guy?

750
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,950
He said I was just another weapon in your arsenal.

751
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,900
Well, maybe that's what we should call you, then.

752
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,090
Arsenal.

753
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,120
I don't know why you would ever let me suit up

754
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,250
after what I did.

755
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,980
Doesn't matter anyway, because...

756
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,580
I'm going to be turning myself in.

757
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,850
OK.

758
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,930
There's something you need to know, Roy.

759
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,310
Something that your mind has been trying to tell you.

760
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,490
And I think it best

761
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,830
if you help me let it.

762
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,920
With a candle?

763
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,120
With meditation.

764
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,320
Clear your thoughts.

765
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,220
Find hidden truths.

766
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,020
This is weird.

767
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,640
You're hurting.

768
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,680
But it's not for the reasons that you think.

769
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,230
And I've been afraid

770
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,450
that if I just came out and told you,

771
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,460
it would only make the hurt worse.

772
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,480
Do you trust me?

773
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,710
Always.

774
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,180
Good. Close your eyes.

775
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,030
Now focus on your breathing.

776
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,220
In through your nose,

777
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,240
out through your mouth.

778
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,380
In...

779
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,850
Out.

780
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,160
Floating along, weightless.

781
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:22,780
And the only thing that exists

782
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,060
is your breath.

783
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,430
Now your thoughts are like clouds.

784
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,310
They just drift away.

785
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,780
No!

786
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,780
Let go.

787
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,300
I killed him.

788
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,990
The police officer. Why didn't you tell me?

789
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,620
Because you were overdosed on Mirakuru,

790
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,650
you didn't remember,

791
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,330
and I was hoping that you never would.

792
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,180
But then Felicity told me you had the dream

793
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,240
that you killed Sara, and I realized...

794
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,680
It was a memory.

795
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,970
I think because of the way Sara was murdered,

796
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,370
the fact they used arrows...

797
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,940
brought it to the surface.

798
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,520
So I didn't kill Sara.

799
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,800
No.

800
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,660
But I am a murderer.

801
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,820
- Roy... - No, I just need to be alone for a while.

802
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,290
This is it.

803
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,230
This is the dead drop.

804
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,770
What kind of a message is this?

805
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,250
Have you ever heard of steganography?

806
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,540
Is that the dinosaur with the plates on its back?

807
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,070
It's the art of concealing a message

808
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:49,550
within another message. In this case,

809
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,140
within an image.

811
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,680
Li Kuan Hui.

812
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,070
- Who's that? - I do not know.

813
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,980
But if Chien Na Wei's interested in him,

814
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,580
so are we.

815
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,280
It worked. Thank you.

816
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,040
I don't want your gratitude.

817
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,330
There's only one thing I want from you.

818
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,800
Name it.

819
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,250
Get out of our lives as soon as possible.

820
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,290
Sign says "closed." Learn to read.

821
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,730
I thought you might make an exception.

822
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,320
Yeah? And why would I do that?

823
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:40,350
Because I just made sure your past vigilantism

824
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,720
fell under the statute of limitations.

825
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,920
No new charges will be filed.

826
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,060
Much obliged.

827
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,350
But you still shouldn't be here.

828
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,060
No, this is exactly where I should be.

829
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,020
Last night when Isaac had me at gunpoint

830
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,770
and when he was shooting at my friends,

831
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,450
I should have been so scared.

832
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,840
Rattled.

833
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,940
But I wasn't.

834
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,220
I saw what needed to be done, and I did it.

835
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:06,980
Because you taught me.

836
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,330
I've just been teaching you how to throw a proper jab.

837
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,420
And your pal Robin Hood doesn't want me even doing that.

838
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,760
I want you to give me the tools

839
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,530
to avenge my sister's death.

840
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,380
I want you to teach me to get justice outside of a courtroom.

841
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,420
I took on an apprentice once.

842
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,200
That didn't work out so good.

843
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,710
Well, it's like you said--

844
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,140
It's not about how you get knocked down to the mat.

845
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,000
It's about whether you get up.

847
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,000
Who the hell are you?

848
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,440
I'm Cupid, stupid.
