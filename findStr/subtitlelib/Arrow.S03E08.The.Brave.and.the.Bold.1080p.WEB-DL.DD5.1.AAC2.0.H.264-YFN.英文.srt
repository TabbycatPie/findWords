7
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:03,660
My name is Oliver Queen.

8
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,560
After five years in hell,

9
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,470
I have come home with only one goal--

10
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,630
to save my city.

11
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,030
Now others have joined my crusade.

12
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,890
To them, I am Oliver Queen.

13
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,770
To the rest of Starling City,

14
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,240
I am someone else.

15
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,410
I am something else.

16
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,740
Previously on "Arrow" and "Flash"...

17
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,540
- Hello? - It's Barry. Barry Allen.

18
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,100
I woke up. I could use some advice.

19
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,680
I don't think that bolt of lightning struck you, Barry.

20
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,350
I think it chose you.

21
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,050
You can inspire people

22
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,550
in a way that I never could.

23
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,690
So what are you guys doing in Central City?

24
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,700
Working a case. Suspicious homicide,

25
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,450
in the Starling where the murder weapon...

26
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,570
is a boomerang.

27
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,010
- Partners? - Partners.

28
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,610
Barry has super powers, Oliver has a bow and arrow.

29
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,590
If I had a DNA sample I was unable to fully break down,

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,250
do you think you could isolate the genetic markings for me?

31
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,310
- What's the sample from? - Canary's murder.

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,110
In position?

33
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,370
In position.

34
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,740
In position.

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,230
Neighborhood's clear.

36
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,190
You know, I probably should have brought this up before,

37
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,530
but if this place doesn't belong to the killer

38
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,210
you chased to Central City and back, well,

39
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,290
we're going to have a lot of explaining to do.

40
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,660
It's his.

41
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,860
Why, because the residue S.T.A.R. labs

42
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,100
found on the boomerang says so?

43
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,670
Because the whole place is rigged.

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,720
I can see a trip wire connected to pressurized gas.

45
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,290
Front door will be the same.

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,000
Our new friend doesn't want any surprise visitors.

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,070
Well, he's going to get a surprise.

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:35,190
Looks like we interrupted his dinner.

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,400
We just missed him.

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,460
Drop your guns.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,250
Sure thing. Right when you learn how to count.

52
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,580
You're outnumbered, jerkwad.

53
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,370
You're not SCPD.

54
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,970
Unless police uniforms have gotten

55
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,700
really interesting, neither are you.

56
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:56,830
A.R.G.U.S.

57
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,060
Your flanking patterns haven't changed in years.

58
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,560
Why is A.R.G.U.S. in on this?

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,320
The man who was killed by the boomerang...

60
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,400
He was an A.R.G.U.S. agent?

61
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Which makes this an A.R.G.U.S. matter.

62
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,860
Bug out. Target's not here.

63
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,420
Let this go.

64
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,070
Are we going to let this go?

65
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,910
What do you think?

66
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,060
What about this A.R.G.U.S. angle?

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,670
Well, A.R.G.U.S. wiped all evidence of their agent's death

68
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,230
after he was killed, or at least they thought they did.

69
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,540
Our boomerang victim, Kai Wu.

70
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,240
The man's profile is so clean,

71
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,630
I should have known it was an A.R.G.U.S. cover.

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,980
Well, now that we know Wu is A.R.G.U.S.,

73
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,470
maybe Lyla can get us a lead?

74
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,280
If this an A.R.G.U.S. thing,

75
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,640
Lyla's going to want it to stay that way.

76
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,200
Then tell her to stop letting people get killed in my city.

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,650
You really don't care about my marriage, do you?

78
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,510
Well, I would...

79
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,820
if you and Lyla were still married.

80
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,610
Thank you for coming.

81
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,080
Like I had a choice.

82
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,330
I see you made a new friend.

83
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,950
This is Katsu Cheng.

84
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,980
Mr. Cheng fancies himself

85
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,160
something of a munitions specialist.

86
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,980
According to HKPF,

87
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,180
Cheng planted an explosive device somewhere in Hong Kong,

88
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,590
I need you to talk to him, find out the bomb's location.

89
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,560
So I'm just going to talk to him

90
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,960
and he's going to give me information?

91
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,240
It won't be easy.

92
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:38,180
That's why I brought you your tools.

93
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,570
What tools?

94
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,920
We recovered these from the freighter

95
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,950
when we recovered you.

96
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,720
You're welcome.

97
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,200
You want me to torture this guy

98
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,710
to find out where the bomb is?

99
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,360
I want you to find out where the bomb is.

100
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,990
How you do so is of little interest to me.

102
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,480
Almost done here, Jerry.

103
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,810
You should have gone home hours ago.

104
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,880
Who's Jerry?

105
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,290
This place is bigger than my apartment.

106
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,720
What are you guys doing here?

107
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,870
You asked us to analyze the DNA off the arrow

108
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,000
that killed Sara.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,540
I was just going to mail you the sample.

110
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,200
We had some vacation days coming--

111
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,500
We want to see the Arrow Cave.

112
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,200
We don't call it that.

113
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,390
Ever.

114
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,500
I want to see the toys!

115
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,320
I need to see the toys.

116
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,480
Do you guys have an arrowmobile?

117
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,410
Don't touch that.

118
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,110
Or that.

119
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,800
It's a jettisoning arrow. Uses compressed CO2--

120
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,580
Compressed CO2 to jettison high tensile

121
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,390
- strength polymer cables. - Yep.

122
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,260
Since when did we start selling admission to the Arrow Cave?

123
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,740
It's...

124
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,390
Do you see what you've done?

125
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,580
Incredible.

126
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,260
I have so many ideas for improvements.

127
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,910
And this. Oh, oh, man!

128
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,430
This--this is the bomb.

129
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,420
And I mean, red is so much cooler than green, am I right?

130
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,760
I am really starting to like this guy.

131
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,850
Hey, what's that for?

132
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,390
Distracting me from work.

133
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,840
So where's Mr. Diggle?

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,020
He's running down a lead.

136
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,010
We have this handled, Johnny.

137
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,180
I told Oliver that already.

138
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,380
Seriously. It's an internal A.R.G.U.S. matter.

139
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,020
I told him that, too. Listen, sweetie,

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,490
a guy who kills with boomerangs?

141
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,540
That's a little outside you guys' wheelhouse.

142
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,460
While exotic killers are more...

143
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,960
our thing.

144
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,000
You only call me "sweetie" when you want something.

145
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,500
Is it working?

148
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,900
Hang on a second.

149
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,610
Is there a problem?

150
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,870
Something strange with your ID.

151
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,670
I'm going to have to detain you for a minute.

152
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,590
If that's a problem, I really don't care.

153
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,040
You know,

154
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,800
you should how you treat people, my friend.

155
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,470
After all...

156
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,760
what goes around, comes around.

157
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,040
I appreciate the offer, Johnny,

158
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,810
but really, we have it handled.

159
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,600
Is that your "we have it handled" alarm?

160
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,500
We have a breach. Initiate lockdown protocols.

161
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,110
Diggle.

162
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,760
We have a bit of a situation here.

163
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,640
Our man's at A.R.G.U.S. Lyla's here.

164
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,960
Oliver, this guy? He's the real deal.

165
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,530
Our target is storming A.R.G.U.S. And Lyla is there.

166
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,570
Bad ass.

167
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,890
So cool!

168
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,520
It'll be over by the time they get there.

170
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,860
Sweetie.

171
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,930
You only call me "sweetie" when you want something.

172
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,990
Get down!

173
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,440
No, Chase, just because we kiss,

174
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
it doesn't mean anything, ok?

175
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,380
Are you sure you're ok?

176
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,620
- What was that? - A better question--

177
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,400
who attacked you?

178
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,460
And don't tell him it was an internal A.R.G.U.S. matter.

179
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,360
His name is Digger Harkness.

180
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,620
Former ASIS.

181
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,900
His specialty is weapons and technology before he went rogue.

182
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,070
Started selling his services to the highest bidder.

183
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,390
We caught him three years ago.

184
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,800
Well, looks like he escaped.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,410
Not exactly. Harkness' skills

186
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,810
made him an ideal recruit for Task Force X.

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,560
You mean the suicide squad.

188
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,890
They had an op in Tanzania.

189
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,300
Assassination of a local warlord.

190
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,290
But the warlord had bigger guns.

191
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,860
The mission went south,

192
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,550
and the team had to be sanitized.

193
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,120
You mean killed, Lyla.

194
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,060
Waller couldn't be reached. It was my call.

195
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,770
The micro bomb in Harkness' neck must have malfunctioned.

196
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,440
We need to consider that every A.R.G.U.S.

197
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,920
facility is compromised.

198
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,750
There's only one place we can keep you safe.

199
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,470
How often does Oliver do this?

200
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,110
At least every Wednesday.

201
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,120
There's a lot of sweating.

202
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,770
I don't see what's so hard about that.

203
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,550
I'm not sure she should have called you.

204
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,110
Oliver doesn't play well with others.

205
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,320
Come on. Barry and Oliver kicked ass last week.

206
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,280
Yeah!

207
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,220
They were in, like... a league of their own.

208
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,540
Yeah, that was, like, a one time thing.

209
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,060
The dude was tossing around exploding boomerangs.

210
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,200
They needed some back-up.

211
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,660
And I need some dinner.

212
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,640
That salmon ladder made me hungry for sushi.

213
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,610
And I need to get some paperweights down here!

214
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,720
I should have warned you about that.

215
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,110
Are you ok?

216
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,430
Can't work for A.R.G.U.S. without making a few enemies.

217
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm sorry to involve all of you in this.

218
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,730
Is that A.R.G.U.S. property?

219
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,760
It's evidence.

220
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,750
Secret identity?

221
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,080
They're married.

222
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,250
We're not married.

223
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,170
Or together. Whatever.

224
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,250
He told her about me. You didn't?

225
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,860
I keep secrets for a living, man.

226
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,770
My bad.

227
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,030
You're, you're--

228
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,510
The Flash. Sushi?

229
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,050
We need a location on the man who's after Lyla.

230
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,100
His name is Digger Harkness.

231
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,400
The first step is to work the evidence--

232
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,260
Barry, can I speak to you for a moment, please?

233
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,330
I appreciate your help back at A.R.G.U.S.,

234
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,720
but we have this handled.

235
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,990
You don't want to team up again?

236
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,200
Things work differently here.

237
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,580
Starling City is meaner.

238
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,670
I seem to remember helping you pretty good last year,

239
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,970
and that was without powers.

240
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,330
I've been practicing everything you taught me.

241
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,220
I'm--I'm casing new environments;

242
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,340
I'm not running in blind.

243
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,860
We do this my way.

244
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,610
Yes! This is going to be awesome.

245
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,280
Ok, what's our first move?

246
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,820
We need to reassemble the evidence.

247
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,270
It will take some time, but it'll--

248
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,410
But it'll be worth it.

249
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,870
Rad!

250
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,180
These are a bit more teched out

251
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,620
than the one you guys brought to Central City.

252
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,140
3D printed polymer with a circuitry weave.

253
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,840
Some of Harkness' boomerangs exploded.

254
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,490
Oh, yeah, there are grooves in here

255
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,170
that could definitely pack a C4 charge.

256
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:36,860
Maybe if we figure out

257
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,160
where Harkness got the supplies,

258
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,550
we can use that to track him.

259
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,080
These weren't made by ka-boom-boomerang?

260
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,680
Ka-boom-boomerang?

261
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,790
Yeah, you know, he has exploding boomerangs?

262
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,940
That's not your best.

263
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,240
Really? It makes perfect sense--

264
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,970
Cisco.

265
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,340
If Harkness didn't make them,

266
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,660
we need to find out who did.

267
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,890
And who he made the buy off of.

268
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,170
Marcos.

269
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,060
You see this collapsible node design?

270
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,800
Dead giveaway. That's his signature.

271
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,690
We need a location on this...

272
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,710
Klaus Marcos.

273
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,390
No known home address or place of employment for Marcos.

274
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,760
But he was arrested last year by an officer Quentin Lance.

275
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,290
Dad, I absolutely understand,

276
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,710
but my boss wants answers on what the department is doing

277
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,840
about the rash of B&Es on the south side.

278
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,480
Well, you can tell 'em I got a whole squad on it,

279
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,750
but it can only move so fast!

280
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,640
Hey, Laurel, detective--

281
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,860
captain. Cap-- captain. Sorry.

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,420
Don't worry about it. It's been a while.

283
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,400
Is everything ok?

284
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,060
Oh, it's fine. This is, uh...

285
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,590
Ah, Bart Allen, right?

286
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,960
You get hit by a bus or something?

287
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,380
Barry. It was lightning.

288
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,110
Huh. Ow. We worked together on a case last year.

289
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,970
Barry's a friend.

290
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,060
He's in town with the Central City police department

291
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,980
and I was hoping that you could help them with...

292
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,040
He'll explain.

293
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,310
Sure.

294
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,240
Oliver, can I talk to you for a moment?

295
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,050
Yeah.

296
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,760
The Arrow was in Central City.

297
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,940
This is a follow-up.

298
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,400
Kind of.

299
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,080
I'm looking to track down a suspect

300
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,070
you apprehended last year--Klaus Marcos.

301
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,980
You know where we might be able to find him?

302
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,860
None of his last knowns are checking out.

303
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,480
Well, I don't really keep up on

304
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,620
on the skels I busted walking the beat, you know?

305
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,640
I'm not real sentimental that way.

306
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,010
Ok. Uh, what did you arrest him for?

307
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,610
Urmm... identity theft.

308
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,870
He was using some gizmo to steal credit card numbers

309
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,210
for the Bratva. Russian mob.

310
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,060
I cannot believe you're a member of the Russian mob!

311
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,340
Former member, probably.

312
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,180
We had a falling out last year.

313
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,820
This is where they run their cyber crime operation.

314
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,570
Hey, nice outfit, by the way.

315
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
This place looks like a fortress.

316
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,190
Kalishnikovs everywhere.

317
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,450
Roy, take the southeast corner.

318
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,780
Barry, scan the perimeter.

319
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,260
- Dig-- - I've got northwest.

320
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,980
Are you going to be ok?

321
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,570
You think I'll lose it because Harkness is after Lyla?

322
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,120
I'm good.

323
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,770
I had eight seconds to kill.

324
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,050
Was that wrong?

325
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:26,180
What?

326
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,210
My friend wants to have a conversation with you.

327
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,540
You made this for Digger Harkness.

328
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,480
I want to know where he is.

329
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,810
Go to hell.

330
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,330
The only thing that hurts worse than an arrow going in

331
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,940
is an arrow coming out!

332
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,680
Whoa, hey, what are you doing?!

333
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,610
Getting information! Where is he?!

334
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,840
I don't know!

335
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,240
He said he doesn't know!

336
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,470
He's lying. If you want to be able to raise your arm again,

337
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,620
tell me where he is!

338
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,610
Here! Harkness gave it to me. It's encrypted.

339
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,950
I had an order ready for him.

340
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,190
I called, he came.

341
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,950
I don't know where he is, I swear.

342
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,090
I swear!

343
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,890
Felicity can crack the encryption.

344
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,610
Use this to track down Harkness.

345
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,570
You tortured that guy.

346
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,790
I interrogated him.

347
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,650
When my friend said your tactics made you a criminal,

348
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,920
I defended you because I thought you were supposed to be a hero.

349
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,160
I thought we were supposed to be better than them.

350
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,410
Barry...

351
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,990
You live in Central City,

352
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,240
where it's sunny all the time

353
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,460
and your enemies get cute nicknames.

354
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,860
You're not in Central City.

355
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,970
I live in a city

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,400
where my best friend was murdered,

357
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,080
where a woman that I loved was shot full of arrows

358
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,090
and sent tumbling off a rooftop.

359
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,710
Where my mother was murdered right in front of me.

360
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,530
- So before you-- - My mother was murdered

361
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,550
in front of me, too.

362
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,950
But I don't use my personal tragedies

363
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,190
as an excuse to just torture whoever pisses me off.

364
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,520
Well, I'm sorry, Barry,

365
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,300
I'm not as emotionally healthy as you are.

366
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,320
What's wrong with you?!

367
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,050
When we agreed that you were staying,

368
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,420
we decided that it would be on my terms.

369
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,380
If that is proving too difficult for you,

370
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,300
you know your way back to Central City.

371
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,210
Everything all right between you and Speedy?

372
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,140
What? Roy?

373
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,330
Yeah, we're fine.

374
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,320
I meant him.

375
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,360
We had a...

376
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,300
difference of opinion about the way the world works.

377
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,380
I know what that's like.

378
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,570
Well, sometimes they don't see it.

379
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,670
There are people in the world who deal only in extremes--

380
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,680
And it would be naive to

381
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,300
think that anything less than extreme measures

382
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,300
will stop them.

383
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,520
Sometimes bravery isn't enough.

384
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,010
Sometimes the world requires us to be bold.

385
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,260
Whatever the personal cost.

386
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,670
I got him.

387
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,150
He's in a warehouse at the corner of Infantino and Adams.

388
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,070
Is that-- A.R.G.U.S. spy satellite?

389
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,330
Yeah. Maybe.

390
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,150
Thermographic imaging shows ten bodies inside.

391
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,390
Harkness knows we're coming.

392
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,260
I can track the cell phone's position with this.

393
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,270
Cisco, you're with Diggle and Roy.

394
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,230
I'll race you there.

395
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,980
Where's the bomb?

397
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,200
My Chinese sucks.

398
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,630
But that doesn't sound like a location.

399
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,530
Last chance.

400
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,580
Your hands are shaking.

401
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,830
I knew.

402
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,340
You don't have it in you.

403
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,530
You've killed, but torture is different.

404
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,670
For those with a conscience, inflicting pain

405
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:32,190
is more difficult than inflicting death.

406
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,520
- I'll figure it out. - No, you won't.

407
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,160
You don't have the stomach for it.

408
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,230
I do.

409
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,220
To save all those people, I do.

410
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,780
Where's the bomb?

411
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,470
Where's the bomb?!

412
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,610
You ok?

413
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,490
My daughter's mother tried to detonate a bomb

414
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,760
in a man's head and now he's trying to kill her.

415
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,180
So that would be a no.

416
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,940
Look, you don't know me that well.

417
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,530
But I'm the type of guy who's only thought about one thing--

418
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,620
How do I keep the people I love safe?

419
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,800
Well, you seem to me to be pretty good at that.

420
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,090
Maybe before.

421
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,330
I remember a world where people

422
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:34,710
didn't kill each other with boomerangs.

423
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,720
Or walk on water?

424
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,330
Barry can walk on water.

425
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,490
You guys, Harkness has been around

426
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,510
long before people like Barry.

427
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,710
I mean, this world was crazy

428
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,890
before all these meta-humans and super powers, right?

429
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,470
What's-- what's your point?

430
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,930
Well, maybe meta-humans and superpowers were given to us

431
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,140
to deal with the crazy.

432
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,170
You mean by God?

433
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,350
No. By a dark matter wave

434
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,400
released from a failed particle accelerated reaction.

435
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,400
Either way, I think people like Barry are the hope

436
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,550
for saving people like us.

437
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,260
People like your wife and daughter.

438
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,850
- She's not his wife. - She's not my wife.

439
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
Ok.

440
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
Anyway, you see my point, right?

441
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,630
Plus, you got to admit,

442
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,440
it's all pretty freakin' cool, right?

443
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,970
You're late.

444
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,300
I knew he was there.

445
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,280
He's not dead, right?

446
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,520
Tranq arrow.

447
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,990
Same thing I used on you in Central City.

448
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,920
Cisco has the van running.

449
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,520
I see you met Harkness' hired muscle.

450
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,070
Harkness isn't here.

451
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,750
Where's Digger Harkness?

452
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,030
Never met 'em.

453
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,430
But he paid us 10 Gs to give you this.

454
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,900
Ten'll get you twenty this belongs to Harkness.

455
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,650
What does that mean?

456
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,490
That Harkness played you.

458
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,650
- I swear I turned that off. - What?

460
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,750
Marko's phone.

461
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,500
I shut it down after I decrypted it.

462
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,140
Did someone turn it back on remotely?

463
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,500
And back trace the trace?

464
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,050
We have to get out of here now!

465
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,600
Hello, Lyla.

466
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,130
It's been a long time.

467
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,050
- Guns! - Cabinet, third drawer!

468
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,340
Know what I like most about boomerangs, Lyla?

469
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,510
They're proof that things can come back to haunt you.

470
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,350
You had a bomb for the back of my head.

471
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,200
I have a little something special for the back of yours.

472
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,050
Lyla! Get down!

473
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,360
No!

474
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,900
Caitlin!

475
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,180
- Caitlin! - Stop the bleeding.

476
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,740
I need lidocaine.

477
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,980
We have epinephrine!

478
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,220
That'll work.

479
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:54,890
Hey, hey, stay with me!

480
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,960
Just try and keep her awake.

481
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,630
Can you hear me? Lyla?

482
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,140
Lyla! Lyla!

483
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,780
Lyla! She's not breathing!

484
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,230
Lyla!

485
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,140
Lyla!

486
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,770
She's not moving.

487
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,580
I've got her stabilized,

488
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,490
but I can't operate on her here.

489
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,120
Barry...

490
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,230
Starling General's at Eighth and Wilcott.

491
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,470
HKPF IDed her as Sumilu Kang.

492
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,990
She was a student at the university of Hong Kong.

493
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,660
A biology textbook in her backpack.

494
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,960
Apparently she was studying to become a veterinarian.

495
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,330
He would have told me. I just needed more time.

496
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,460
No, Mr. Queen, what you needed was conviction.

497
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,110
And the men who do things like this have it.

498
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,000
Tonight you didn't.

499
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,370
- I thought I could-- - You thought what?

500
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,760
You could reason with him?

501
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,360
Look around you, Mr. Queen.

502
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,690
Look around and tell me that the men

503
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:19,910
who do this type of thing understand reason.

504
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,310
There are people in this world

505
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,570
who deal only in extremes.

506
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,880
It's naive to think that anything less

507
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,240
than extreme measures will stop them.

508
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,160
The bomber was Katsu Cheng.

509
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,540
But make no mistake...

510
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,580
this blood is on your hands.

511
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,570
Cheng said I didn't have the stomach for torture.

512
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,610
He was right!

513
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,310
Because you need to practice.

514
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,450
Torture is an art form.

515
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,940
It's a skill one must cultivate.

516
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,870
- How do I do that? - I think Cheng was wrong.

517
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:52,550
I think you not only have the stomach for this work;

518
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,160
You have the talent.

520
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,200
It feels wrong.

521
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,580
Being here, it feels wrong.

522
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,080
Oliver needed to be alone. He made that pretty clear.

523
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,790
Three doubles, straight up.

524
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,830
You guys ok?

525
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,270
We're just having a tough night.

526
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,110
Anything I can do to help?

527
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,550
No. We're--we're good.

528
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,220
But thanks for the night off.

529
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,230
Yo, who was that hottie?

530
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,700
- My ex-girlfriend. - Oliver's sister.

531
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,990
So stay away, is what you're saying.

532
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,010
Yeah.

533
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,740
She's in surgery. Mr. Diggle is with her.

534
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,190
She going to be ok?

535
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:40,650
I hope so. She's strong.

536
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,110
How do you guys do it? How do you guys live like this?

537
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,070
Where anyone you care about could be struck down?

538
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,280
We haven't been taking this seriously.

539
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,850
It's all been a game. We give the bad guys code names.

540
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,650
I think the fact we go up against Metahumans

541
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,510
made it all kind of clean.

542
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,330
Like, the fact that they've got these powers

543
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,480
makes what they're doing less...

544
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,530
Real.

545
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,700
This is all my fault.

546
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,460
It's really not.

547
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,870
I tortured Marcos to give up that phone.

548
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,310
None of this would have happened if it wasn't for me.

549
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,650
I get the feeling you don't say that very often.

550
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,200
To do what I do, Barry, it takes...conviction.

551
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:38,970
But...

552
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,360
more often than not,

553
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,890
it's the will to do what's ugly.

554
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,480
Every time I do that, I'm...

555
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,420
I'm trading away little...

556
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,430
pieces of myself.

557
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,590
So...you asked what's wrong with me,

558
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,470
that's-- that's what's wrong,

559
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,120
because the part that I'm trading away

560
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,340
is Oliver Queen.

561
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,780
And lately I've been feeling like there is...

562
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,890
nothing left except the Arrow.

563
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,510
I think you're full of crap.

564
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,910
you've convinced yourself that

565
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,650
everything you've been through

566
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,650
took away your humanity.

567
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,400
But I think it's because of your humanity

568
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,680
that you made it through.

569
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,790
You wouldn't have survived,

570
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,780
much less come out the other end a hero,

571
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,900
somebody who wants to do good,

572
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,010
if you didn't have a light inside of you.

573
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,460
I'm sorry if I'm interrupting.

574
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,550
I ran facial recognition on Harkness and I have a match.

575
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,110
Where is he?

576
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,720
Get on the ground.

577
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,660
Why would I want to do that?

578
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,640
You hurt a friend of mine.

579
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,730
You really think there's anywhere in the world

580
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,790
you could run where we won't find you?

581
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,840
Probably not.

582
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,110
Which is why I have a contingency in place.

583
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,330
Five bombs planted throughout Starling.

584
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,950
Now, you can stop me,

585
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,250
or you can stop the bombs.

586
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,430
But you can't do both.

587
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,530
Bombs are armed. In 90 seconds,

588
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,960
this city will be on fire.

589
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,720
Go.

590
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,800
Guys! Harkness just triggered five bombs throughout the city.

591
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,070
We don't know where.

592
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,450
To blanket the entire city, he'd have to use--

593
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,310
Radio controlled I.E.D.s.

594
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,250
But if we key into the detonator's frequency...

595
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,370
We can pinpoint the location of the bombs.

596
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,080
I need a location!

597
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,620
I need five locations!

598
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,970
The five receivers.

599
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,680
Nearest one is behind a restaurant at Faith and Flower.

600
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,630
Ok, hey, guys, I found it.

601
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,710
I'm going to run it out of the city.

602
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,810
Barry, wait!

603
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:23,160
That's not an option.

604
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,090
We think the bombs might be linked.

605
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,040
What?

606
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,310
Press the emblem on your suit.

607
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,370
I installed a mini-cam there last week.

608
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,770
Ok. You see the secondary trigger?

609
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,320
It's not just a receiver...

610
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,530
It's a transmitter.

611
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,260
Barry, if you try to defuse the bomb,

612
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,270
the secondary trigger's going to transmit a signal

613
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,850
and the rest of the bombs are going to explode.

614
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,730
We're running out of time.

615
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,770
You have to defuse all the bombs at the same time.

616
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,720
You're thinking of multiplex.

617
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,590
I can't be in five places at once.

618
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,820
But I don't have to be.

619
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,380
- Stop the countdown! - Go to hell.

620
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,730
- Last chance! - Or what?

621
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,040
You'll inflict pain?

622
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,070
Ah, I can tell you've done it before, so let me ask you this...

623
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,080
why are you hesitating?

624
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,290
Ten more seconds.

625
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,310
We should be able to see at least, ah,

626
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,990
three explosions from here.

627
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,530
Ok.

628
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,850
Everyone has to cut their wire exactly on three.

629
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,390
1, 2,

630
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,860
3!

631
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,580
Screw you, captain boomerang.

632
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,960
You think you've accomplished something here?

633
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,000
You think you not killing me makes you strong?

634
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,180
It just means...

635
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,030
you're weak.

636
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,360
It means I have some humanity left.

637
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,950
You just couldn't resist, could you?

638
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,190
Hey, sweetie.

639
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,330
You only call me "sweetie" when you want something.

640
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,310
I do.

641
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,830
I want you to marry me.

642
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,140
I can't believe I waited this long to ask.

643
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,950
I need you, Lyla.

644
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,830
Now, forever, official.

645
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,920
I need you.

646
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,200
Will you please stop talking...

647
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,410
so I can say yes?

648
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,400
Some of the STR markers on the DNA sample have degraded,

649
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,990
but I've got a computer back at the lab

650
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:18,310
that I think will help fill in the gaps.

651
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:19,320
Thank you, Caitlin.

652
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,080
I'll let you know as soon as I have the results.

653
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,610
I'll call this time.

654
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,850
It's cool.

655
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,090
- You guys are fun. - So are you guys.

656
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,990
Well, you could be if you realized

657
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,410
you were working under a nightclub.

658
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,640
Oh, did you guys take care of business?

659
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,570
Digger Harkness is now cell mates

660
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:38,990
with one Slade Wilson.

661
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,030
We've got a pipeline, he's got a gorgeous tropical island.

662
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,700
With landmines.

663
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,410
What?

664
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,200
It's a long story.

665
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,360
What's this?

666
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,380
Oliver helped me put that in while

667
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,780
you guys were at the hospital.

668
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,850
Wait, this is for me?

669
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,470
For the next time you're in town.

670
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,120
There'll be a next time?

671
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,050
I'm still calling the shots.

672
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,400
- We'll talk about that. - Yes, we will.

673
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,390
And then I'll call the shots.

674
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,160
We got a gift for you, too, Oliver.

675
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,710
Early Christmas present.

676
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,020
Turns out S.T.A.R. labs' industrial fabricator

677
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,100
was based out of Starling, so...

678
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,240
Polymer Kevlar weave.

679
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,990
It's 25% lighter and can carry 15% more gear.

680
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:26,870
I've got designs I'm working up that I'm really excited by.

681
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,980
It's, uh, it's subtle.

682
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,690
I wanted to replace the hood,

683
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,820
but, uh, Felicity said it had sentimental value.

684
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,380
- Thank you. - Any time.

685
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,980
You guys headed back?

686
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,850
It's possible

687
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,640
that Dr. Wells didn't sign off on us leaving town.

688
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,740
Hey, do you still, like, take the train?

689
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,070
Yeah, sure, if I feel like taking a nap.

690
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,110
But Oliver and I have some unfinished business

691
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,360
to take care of first.

692
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,410
You guys aren't going

693
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,270
to punch each other, are you?

694
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,740
Why'd you summon me here?

695
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,900
To make me feel worse?

696
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,800
No, I summoned you here to give you a second chance.

697
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,200
Is this a joke?

698
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,100
No.

699
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,090
This is Li Khuan Hui.

700
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,290
That name should sound familiar to you.

701
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,370
You work for China White.

702
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,040
Chien Na Wei. Yes, Mr. Hui is on her payroll.

703
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,570
He's Chinese triad,

704
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,120
and he knows her agenda here in Hong Kong.

705
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,160
Fortunately for you, Mr. Hui has been

706
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,790
less than forthcoming with the details.

707
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,090
Fortunately?

708
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,130
You get a stab at redemption.

709
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,910
You could have invited everybody, they'd like this.

710
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,460
Well, no, they would love this,

711
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,170
but this is just for the two of us.

712
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,600
You mean, the one of you. This was your idea.

713
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,430
You can't expect me to believe

714
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:10,070
that you don't want to know, once and for all,

715
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,340
who would win --

716
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,180
Me or you.

717
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,690
You mean if you don't shoot me in the back.

718
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,830
You got to get over that, Barry.

719
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,810
OK, I have super powers.

720
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:19,520
You have arrows that run out.

721
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,900
I have strategy and tactical awareness.

722
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,760
When I'm fighting you, it's literally like you're standing still.

723
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,670
That's tough talk, you ready to back it up?

724
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,790
Oh, yeah.

725
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,960
Hey, by the way...

726
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,290
Yeah?

727
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,500
You were wrong.

728
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,280
When you told me I could inspire people,

729
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,630
you said you couldn't.

730
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,330
But you were wrong -- you can inspire.

731
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,250
Not as the Arrow, that guy's a douche.

732
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,330
But as Oliver Queen.

733
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,750
Thank you.

734
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,680
Since we're sharing,

735
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,180
you were wrong, too.

736
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,570
- When? - Right now.

737
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:58,930
Because you think you can kick my ass.

738
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,790
I can tell.

00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:07,250

742
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,410
