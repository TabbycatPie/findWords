18
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,420
Yes, I know you've been calling.

19
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,000
I just--I haven't had time to schedule a follow-up.

20
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,250
Understood, Dr. Eli,

21
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,860
but I have no plans to get pregnant again, so...

22
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,180
I'm at work. I have to call you back.

23
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,310
- Is that all right? Thanks. - Everything all right?

24
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,430
Yeah, just a thing I'm pushing.

25
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,920
You just missed our bud Barkey again.

26
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,030
He dropped the price 5K.

27
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,120
Adam, what are you actually gonna do with a boat?

28
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,490
I don't know, sail the seven seas,

29
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,680
become a new man.

30
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,080
Park it in my garage, drink beer on it.

31
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,840
Exactly, kind of boat Barkey's gonna sell you,

32
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,680
garage is a lot more likely.

33
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,410
Anyway, I'm just saying...

34
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,860
- Yeah? - The change is good, you know?

35
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,150
Like, for instance, you and I, we don't date,

36
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,900
and yet somehow we've become my Gammie and Pawpaw.

37
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,830
You still call them that?

38
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,290
Well, that is their name.

39
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,600
We go to the same diner every morning.

40
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,860
We go to work. We go to the same bar.

41
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,630
We do nothing new. We go nowhere new.

42
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,820
We meet nobody, date nobody.

43
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,690
- We have no boat. - See? Exactly.

44
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,150
This is what I'm talking about.

45
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,000
See, you're even finishing my thoughts here.

46
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Change is overrated, Adam.

47
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,900
The whole world's looking for a little same old right now.

48
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,680
Yeah, not guys like me and Barkey.

49
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,350
No. You and Barkey are a set of real revolutionary thinkers--

50
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,280
Yeah, exactly.

51
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,930
- Yeah, I'm an adventurer. - Of course.

52
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,760
I'm like a Renaissance man over here.

53
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,850
You are, mm-hmm.

54
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,730
Adam!

55
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,940
Oh, my God.

56
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,420
Get out of the road, kid!

57
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,400
Stay in your car. Stay in your car.

58
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,480
- Is she alone? - Close your door.

59
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,070
- kiddo. - Where's her family?

60
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,070
It's all right.

61
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,030
It's okay. It's okay.

62
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,360
Let's get you out of the street, okay?

63
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,840
Where's your family?

64
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,930
What are you doing around here? Do you live around here?

65
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,570
- Did you run from someplace? - All right, keep moving.

66
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,190
Are you lost, honey?

67
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,470
There. Do you live right there?

68
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,680
Is that where you live?

69
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,390
Are you lost?

70
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,980
She's not talking.

71
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,290
There's nobody out here. I mean, there's nobody around.

72
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,680
Where's your family? Do you know?

73
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,940
Okay, let's start again. I'm Kim.

74
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,840
This is Adam. And we're police, see?

75
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,930
That's what that star means.

76
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,700
I'm a police officer. I'm gonna help you.

77
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,750
Okay? I promise.

78
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,440
Yeah, this is Officer Adam Ruzek, Intelligence.

79
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,590
- Recovered a tender age child... - I like your outfit.

80
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,900
Could I check something really quickly?

81
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,430
Just--I'm just gonna... really fast.

83
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,250
- Adam? - One sec.

84
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,430
Makayla Ward.

85
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,090
- Yeah, I got a name. - It's okay.

86
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,730
Everything is gonna be okay, all right?

87
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,580
Public school system has the mom listed

88
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,590
as Gabrielle Ward.

89
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,820
- 4818 should be- - Over there?

90
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,880
Yeah, there it is.

91
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,120
She's sleeping.

92
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,340
- I'll have the parents come out. - Yeah.

93
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,170
Soft door. Don't wake her up.

94
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,710
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - All right.

95
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,990
5021 Eddie, requesting backup at 4818 South Wells.

96
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,850
Copy that, 5021 Eddie. Backup on the way.

97
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,660
What's going on?

98
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,370
There's blood splatter, a lot of it.

99
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,700
Ready?

100
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,940
Ah, it's open.

101
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,770
All right.

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,750
One, two, three.

103
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,550
- Cover me. - Yup.

104
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,730
Cover, cover, cover.

105
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,880
- Body. - Gotcha.

106
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,950
Clear.

107
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,860
I got another body.

108
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,420
- You hear that? - Yeah.

109
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,040
The back door.

110
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,760
Backyard's clear.

111
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,600
Adam.

112
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,500
Look at these little footprints.

113
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,390
That little girl, Makayla, she was here.

114
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,180
All right. Call it in.

115
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,630
I'm gonna go check on her.

117
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,740
Burgess took the girl to Med. They're checking her out.

118
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,910
- Witnesses? - Not yet.

119
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,150
We're working the block.

120
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,080
ID the victims?

121
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,280
So they're all members of the same family, the Wards.

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,260
They all live in the house.

123
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,590
And the little girl, Makayla?

124
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,550
She's the only family member that survived.

125
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,280
All right, let's keep a cap on the media as long as we can.

126
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,910
Means no one but the techs and us

127
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,610
step foot on this property.

128
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,740
It is absolute overkill in here.

129
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,000
Had to be personal.

130
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,360
This is Claudia Ward.

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,100
She's the matriarch of the family.

132
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,770
House is in her name.

133
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,530
One GSW to the back of the head.

134
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,280
Looks like she was running to the front door.

135
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,320
Her kill is the cleanest out of all of them.

136
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,170
This is her son Benny Ward, 22.

137
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,080
He's got bruising, defense wounds.

138
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,900
Looks like he was pistol-whipped.

139
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,060
His sister's here in the kitchen.

140
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,890
Gabrielle Ward, Makayla's mother.

141
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,740
One GSW to the stomach, two to the back.

142
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,110
She...bled out slow.

143
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,540
No sign of robbery yet.

144
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,050
Cash was left on the table in the front.

145
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,250
Purses and wallets in plain view.

146
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,400
No forced entry?

147
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,750
No, doesn't look like it.

148
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,620
Front and the back door were unlocked.

149
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,220
- It's the little girl? - Yeah.

150
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,410
Prints match Makayla's shoes. We think she was inside.

151
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,520
She was probably hiding, maybe here in the pantry.

152
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,350
Shooter makes his way to the front.

153
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,150
She finds her mom bleeding,

154
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,970
takes off out the back.

155
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,980
Mom told her to run.

156
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,480
Yeah.

157
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,140
Med cleared the girl. No injuries.

158
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,560
Yeah, Burgess is with her. We're waiting on DCFS.

159
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,620
All right, talk to me. What do we got?

160
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,570
Ward family, no priors except for Benny,

161
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,900
who has a year-old possession charge.

162
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,480
Thinking the shooter might've used a suppressor.

163
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,910
No one heard or saw anything, and zero cams.

164
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,000
I connected with Forensics. It's gonna take them some time.

165
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,840
Three bodies, that's a lot of DNA.

166
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,930
Four people living in one house,

167
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,890
that's a lot of foot traffic.

168
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:05,020
Well, we work the why first.

169
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,910
Home invasion gone wrong? A hit?

170
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,410
Family disagreement? Murder turned triple homicide?

171
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,110
There can be plenty of possibilities,

172
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,070
but it's gonna be the why that gets us to who.

173
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,700
I got a possible why.

174
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,490
Benny Ward's yearlong possession charge

175
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,840
is not the full story.

176
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,630
Kid's got a couple gang dispersal cards,

177
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,050
quite the social media presence.

178
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,510
According to the Gang Unit and CPIC,

179
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,060
he's been the enforcer for the Gangster Prophets

180
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,230
for the past two years.

181
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,540
Okay, so he had enemies.

182
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,700
He's got a lot of enemies.

183
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,280
CPIC sent over a whole list.

184
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,140
Over a dozen death threats online.

185
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,510
So wait. We think this is gang retribution?

186
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,950
They'd do a whole family like that?

187
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,970
Listen, no reason is ever gonna feel like enough, Adam.

188
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,190
- DCFS is downstairs. - All right, so run it down.

189
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,610
Talk to your CIs.

190
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,940
If this was a gang hit, the streets will know.

191
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,530
Sarge. They're here.

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,390
Lieutenant, good to see you.

193
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,390
Hey, wanted to work this one myself.

194
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,580
30 years. Juvenile cases.

195
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,080
Happy to have you on this one.

196
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,950
This is Alanah Mercer with DCFS.

197
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,840
Is someone from Makayla's family on the way?

198
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,450
Unfortunately, most of the girl's family was in that home.

199
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,840
She doesn't have any father on the birth certificate.

200
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,140
Only immediate kin is a cousin of Gabrielle's.

201
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,550
We're trying to track her down.

202
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,030
I understand you believe Makayla is a potential witness.

203
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,410
We have evidence that she was in the home.

204
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,710
As of now, she might be our only witness.

205
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,330
She still hasn't said a word, though.

206
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,170
At her age, that's pretty expected.

207
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,150
Trauma like that, fear, it floods the system.

208
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,550
Doesn't go away quick.

209
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,930
Might be days, weeks, months before she talks about it.

210
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,460
Well, we would like to question her if possible.

211
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,650
You can try as long as it's not harming her,

212
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,780
but Alanah and the hospital need to be kept apprised.

213
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,890
No problem.

214
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,390
Kim, you run point.

215
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,160
Sarge, I don't have any experience

216
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,140
working with children.

217
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,230
- A youth detective would be-- - You were her first contact?

218
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,630
Yeah, I was her first contact.

219
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,150
Priority is to make her feel safe.

220
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,390
She certainly won't talk or move forward until then.

221
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,550
Right now, you're the best option

222
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,840
to make her feel that way.

223
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,510
Okay.

224
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,450
She hasn't talked yet.

225
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,800
How am I supposed to make this kid feel safe

226
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,030
after what happened?

227
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,100
Honestly, I don't know.

228
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,460
But I don't think there's just one right way.

229
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,650
All right.

230
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,720
I brought you something to eat.

231
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,470
So I--

232
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,890
I was hoping and thinking

233
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,880
we could maybe talk a little about what happened

234
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,800
before I found you on the street.

235
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,980
What do you think?

236
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,470
Okay?

237
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,310
Did you run there from your house?

238
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,660
Do you remember being at home?

239
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,940
Makayla, do you remember anything about what happened?

240
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,690
Anything at all?

241
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,960
Okay.

242
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,990
Nah, nah. You told me we were done.

243
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,540
You told me you was going to New York.

244
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,450
I'm back now.

245
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,480
Nope.

246
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,210
Look, I ain't stepping foot near no massacre.

247
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,300
That's very perceptive of you, Marv.

248
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,320
I never told you why we're here.

249
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,360
It's bad karma.

250
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,180
You can't go pirouetting around a whole family murdered.

251
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,540
- Pirouetting? - It's not good for the soul.

252
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,340
- Nah. You can't bribe me on this one. - No?

253
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,500
'Cause your sister called me last week

254
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,230
saying you broke into her place looking for cash.

255
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,320
Scared the hell out of your niece.

256
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,920
- I didn't mean to do that. - All we need is a name.

257
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,250
Benny was a Gangster Prophet,

258
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,210
and we know the streets are talking,

259
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,760
so who are they saying killed his family?

260
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,820
Marv, when have I ever

261
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,970
asked you a question not worth answering for me?

262
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,990
The streets are saying

263
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,550
a Southside Hustler took them out.

264
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,830
Okay, you got a name?

265
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,300
Tru!

266
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,020
Goes by Tru. He killed them.

267
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,140
Why?

268
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,540
Benny and Tru got into it a couple of weeks ago.

269
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,580
Guys broke it up

270
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,220
but not before Benny jacked a beer bottle into Tru's eye.

271
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,820
The killings were payback,

272
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,160
karma.

273
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,630
This him?

274
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,530
Yeah, that's him.

275
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,220
He usually hangs at the Y courts.

276
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,040
Plays ball there.

277
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,670
Call your sister and apologize.

278
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,540
Truman Powell, 27.

279
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,090
Got two priors for assault.

280
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:10,000
CPIC has him on for multiple threats against Benny online,

281
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,530
and he's got an open warrant for aggravated battery.

282
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,560
Works for me.

283
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,700
I got the front door covered. Let's take him outside.

284
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,240
You got an anchor?

285
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,440
Yeah. Got my eye on you. Got your six.

286
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,550
He's coming out.

287
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,390
Truman Powell, Chicago PD! Stop!

288
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,770
Truman, Chicago PD!

289
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,590
Arm up! Arm up!

290
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,360
Okay, we're done! Stop fighting!

291
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,720
Turn over.

292
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,710
Don't move.

293
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,130
All right, let's go. Get up!

294
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,060
Get up!

295
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,350
You got an outstanding warrant,

296
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,330
History of violence,

297
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,660
multiple threats against a dead man,

298
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,350
and we ran your car, Tru; you're four blocks

299
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,530
from the Wards' house two hours before the killings.

300
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,770
What, you just wanna sit there and smile at me?

301
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey, if I were you,

302
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,290
I'd at least give us the bare minimum.

303
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,480
You got an alibi you wanna give us?

304
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,010
I got a lawyer. I'll call him now.

305
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,770
- You catch that? - Yeah, he knows something.

306
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,760
He's good at pretending he's not scared, though.

307
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,240
Hey, Upton.

308
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,630
Not just calling me anymore.

309
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,140
Now the feds are sending me packages for you.

310
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,510
- Thank you. - You're gonna have

311
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,670
to rein this in at some point,

312
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,840
not that I don't like being your mail lady.

313
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,460
I know. Thank you.

314
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,760
The feds?

315
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,180
Look, I don't care if Tru's not talking.

316
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,600
He's still looking good for it.

317
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,200
And ballistics came back.

318
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,950
The bullets match an unsolved Southside Hustler shoot.

319
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,670
Would make sense if it was a gang pass-down piece.

320
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,450
All right, so we hold Tru for 48,

321
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,330
see if we can place him at the scene.

322
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,410
Hey, Kim make any progress with the kid?

323
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,170
Not yet.

324
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:08,390
Family Services are gonna have to relocate her tonight.

325
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,190
Kim's out trying something right now.

326
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,750
All right, let's hit it.

327
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:16,070
What did the feds want?

328
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,110
It's a job offer.

329
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,780
Well, that's good. Where at?

330
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,520
New York?

331
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:27,840
Cool.

332
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,620
- Stayed in the same place? - Yeah.

333
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,680
Okay, great.

334
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,040
I went and I grabbed what I hoped were favorites.

335
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,400
Got this guy. Seemed nice.

336
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,820
How about--oh.

337
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,310
Penguin, huh?

338
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,980
and I brought your mom's sweater.

339
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,000
Thought maybe you might wanna wear it.

340
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,870
Let's put it on you.

341
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,320
'Cause I have some friends I want you to meet.

342
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,170
This is my friend Alanah, the lady you met before.

343
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,070
This is Trudy. You know her.

344
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,320
And that's Claire.

345
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,340
Claire has this really nice house she's gonna take you to.

346
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,890
You're gonna go, you're gonna get a good nice rest,

347
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,320
and then you're gonna come here,

348
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,140
and then you and I are gonna talk in the morning, all right?

349
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,980
Ready to go, kiddo?

350
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,520
Do you want me to come with you?

351
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,470
Okay.

352
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,280
All right, we'll grab your things.

353
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,110
Bedroom's just down the hall to your right.

354
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,410
Okay. You're going the right way.

355
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,140
It's this door right here, all right?

356
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,960
Wow, look at the stars. Those are cool.

357
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,590
I brought you something,

358
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,710
your pajamas.

359
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,890
You know what I used to do when I was younger?

360
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,300
I would line all my stuffies at the end of my bed

361
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,060
so it was like this little army keeping me safe.

362
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,150
Kind of dumb.

363
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,500
It's okay if you're scared, Makayla.

364
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,740
I've been scared before.

365
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,580
I know the feeling pretty well.

366
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,390
Oh, yeah. Adults get scared for sure.

367
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:56,970
There was a time a few months ago.

368
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,790
I was doing my job, and somebody tried to hurt me.

369
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,720
And I was so scared, but...

370
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,260
that's the good thing about being scared.

371
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,980
Sometimes it's like this reminder

372
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,470
that you have to be brave, you have to fight.

373
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,200
So I fought.

374
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,060
But I ran.

375
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,970
That's okay.

376
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,890
Running is a kind of fighting.

377
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,450
I ran outside.

378
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,510
But she came looking.

379
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
She? You saw a woman in your house?

380
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,760
What was her name? You know her?

381
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,010
Okay.

382
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,260
But she was looking for me.

383
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,660
She was calling my name.

384
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,700
But I hid outside.

385
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,890
Okay.

386
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,880
Can I go to sleep now?

387
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,950
Yeah, Makayla. You can go to bed.

388
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,830
I will be right back, and I will...

389
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,920
tuck you in, okay?

390
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,130
Give me two minutes.

391
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,180
Claire? What's wrong?

392
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,490
I just--I thought I saw someone.

393
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,650
- It's probably a shadow. - What exactly did you see?

394
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,260
Someone along the side of the house,

395
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,220
like they were trying not to be seen.

396
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,140
Get down!

397
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,450
- What's going on - Just get down.

398
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,630
Makayla?

399
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,430
Makayla!

400
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,190
I'm here.

401
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:37,560
Get behind me. Get behind me!

402
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,380
Grab my hand, okay? You're okay. You're okay.

403
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:41,390
You're all right.

404
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,190
Stay behind me no matter what. No matter what.

405
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,270
Claire, get down low.

406
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,170
Get low and come to me. Come to me!

407
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,560
Come to me quick. Take my phone.

408
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,850
Call 911. Get in the bathtub.

409
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,410
Leave the line open. Take Makayla.

410
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,310
Come here, sweetie. You're okay, Makayla!

411
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,320
You're okay. You're okay.

412
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,730
Two intruders in the house. I'm with Officer Kim Burgess...

413
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,090
So patrol arrived after three minutes,

414
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,600
Spotted an SUV fleeing the sence.

415
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,500
black Nissan Pathfinder, no plates.

416
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,630
- They lost the vehicle? - Yeah.

417
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,750
They followed it all the way to Wacker for a mile,

418
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,940
- and then they lost it. - You okay?

419
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,930
Yeah, I saw two different offenders,

420
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,440
both masked and gloved up.

421
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,160
I wasn't able to discern race, height.

422
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,590
Things happened very fast, but they were here for Makayla.

423
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,770
What makes you think that?

424
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,110
They crashed this location ten minutes after we arrived.

425
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,360
They hit her window first.

426
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,810
They must've followed us here.

427
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,740
Opens more questions than answers.

428
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,420
- You think it was a hit - I don't know what it was.

429
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,330
But Makayla had finally started talking.

430
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,030
She said she saw a woman in her house at the time of the murders

431
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,130
and the woman was calling out her name.

432
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,640
Okay, either way, we do need to protect the child

433
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,330
until we have answers.

434
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,440
I'll call WITSEC and get her into protection.

435
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,290
She's staying with me.

436
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,930
No, she can't. That's not protocol.

437
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,560
Well, let's go against protocol.

438
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,890
- Right now, your job is - My job is to protect the kid.

439
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,880
- Is she always like this? - Yeah, she always is.

440
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,840
Well, she's not wrong, and if it was about Makayla,

441
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,830
it's probably best we keep it in-house.

442
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,510
Someone ID'd her location.

443
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,850
Lieutenant, with all due respect,

444
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,080
you can play it by protocol or not.

445
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,180
You can take me off the case.

446
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,220
You can detail me to WITSEC.

447
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,930
I don't care how it happens,

448
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,830
but that kid stays with me.

449
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,520
Okay, we'll get a safe house approved.

450
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,400
Thank you.

451
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,410
You gotta have the teddy bear.

452
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,040
That's a classic, right?

453
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,590
And one more. Which guy here?

454
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,070
You point.

455
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
This guy? This is your favorite?

456
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,900
Okay.

457
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,470
What am I looking at here?

458
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,360
- What is this? - Platypus?

459
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,610
A platypus.

460
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,430
How could I forget the shiny-tailed platypus?

461
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,140
Right here. Is he your favorite?

462
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,970
Yeah, he stays with you, then.

463
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,540
Okay, it's bedtime. Let's go.

464
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,530
You want us to stay with you?

465
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,850
Okay?

466
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,960
Okay. Go on.

467
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:10,970
All right.

468
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,000
Scooch down.

469
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,890
There you go.

470
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,240
Good night, Makayla.

471
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,590
As we've repeatedly said,

472
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,850
my client won't be answering any more questions.

473
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,130
And as I have said, I'm not asking any questions.

474
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,540
I'm just giving him the info.

475
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,780
We learned that there was a woman inside that house,

476
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,770
so clearly, we're missing something.

477
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,770
- He's got nothing to say. - Look, Truman,

478
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,040
you're gonna get booked on your warrant at the end of the day,

479
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,950
so we don't have to release you in 48.

480
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,760
We can keep pressing till we make this fit.

481
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,110
All right, this is enough.

482
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,960
You got motive, no alibi.

483
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,210
You're in the area.

484
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,070
You see how easy I can make it that you and your girl,

485
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,120
you go for a little joyride,

486
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,210
you're looking to settle some scores,

487
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,190
you entered the house and slaughtered everyone inside?

488
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,230
I'd never stepped foot in that house.

489
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,290
You would never step foot in that house?

490
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,970
Why'd you say it like that,

491
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,130
you would never?

492
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,550
Oh, no.

493
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,940
No. Hey, hey, hey.

494
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,460
It was just, um-- it was just a truck, okay?

495
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,530
But what if they come back tonight?

496
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,220
What if who comes back tonight?

497
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,070
This little girl...

498
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,920
watched her mother get killed in front of her.

499
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,320
Her whole family...

500
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,730
was murdered in front of her.

501
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,210
This tiny kid

502
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,310
has to deal with those moments of violence

503
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,580
for the rest of her life.

504
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,210
Look at me.

505
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,940
You said you would never step foot in that house,

506
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,850
and I'm guessing that's because of retribution,

507
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,960
because of Benny.

508
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,050
It's not because of Benny.

509
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,740
Truman, I am advising you--

510
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,000
I would never step foot in that house because of her.

511
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,580
She's the reason why. She's protected.

512
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,810
I go near her, I end up dead.

513
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,740
When you say "they," who are you talking about, huh?

514
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,400
Mm, my daddy and her.

515
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,390
Your daddy?

516
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,960
At your house?

517
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,060
The woman said he was there.

518
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,530
She told me to come out,

519
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,900
that my daddy was there to take me home.

520
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,510
All right. This is Tariq Morris.

521
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,290
He is a notorious Southside Hustler.

522
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,490
He's extremely violent. He's got 12 priors.

523
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:53,920
He's feared by his faction.

524
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,390
According to Truman,

525
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,240
Tariq is Makayla's father.

526
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,260
So Tariq and Gabrielle

527
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,070
dated briefly years ago.

528
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,440
Gabrielle got pregnant.

529
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,890
Tariq ended up in Stateville on a six-year prison sentence.

530
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,060
Before the baby was born,

531
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,570
Gabrielle broke it off with him.

532
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,160
- And Tariq just got released? - Three days ago.

533
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,120
Makayla said there was a woman in the house

534
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,260
calling out her name,

535
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,210
saying her father was there to pick her up.

536
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,630
They were looking for the girl.

537
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,970
So it's been about Makayla this whole time.

538
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,510
They were there to kidnap her.

540
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,550
Okay.

541
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,780
Stateville sent over visitor logs for Tariq,

542
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,120
so we firmed up a theory.

543
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,900
Gabrielle went to visit him once

544
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,050
at the beginning of his sentence.

545
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,750
Didn't bring Makayla, and she never went back.

546
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,160
I talked to a few guards, Sarge.

547
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,710
Apparently, that was the exact visit

548
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,050
that Gabrielle broke up with him.

549
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,610
Took the chance to get her and her daughter the hell away from him.

550
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,450
Stopped answering his messages and his letters,

551
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,740
just completely shut him out.

552
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,420
And he spent six years in prison ruminating on it.

553
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,660
Right, so he goes to that house.

554
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,440
The entire family tries to protect Makayla,

555
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,630
and they get killed for it.

556
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,550
Think we've ID'd the female accomplice.

557
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,000
Nia Benson.

558
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,660
Girl from the neighborhood, half a dozen arrest priors,

559
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,980
not a single charge on her.

560
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,950
Started visiting Tariq in prison about a year ago.

561
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,330
There's phone calls. There's emails.

562
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,090
There's hundreds of visits between the two of them.

563
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,530
This is a full-on prison romance.

564
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,450
She also has a black Nissan Pathfinder,

565
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,770
which is the same SUV that we found at the foster home.

566
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,480
Ruzek's running her LKAs right now.

567
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,460
Yo, I think I got her.

568
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,120
Patrol just responded to our BOLO

569
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,450
at Nia's sister's house.

570
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,990
There's a black Nissan Pathfinder parked in the back alley.

571
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,160
Go grab her.

572
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,360
Please!

573
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,960
Can somebody tell me what's going on?

574
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,590
This cop won't tell me anything.

575
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,350
I don't even get why I'm in here!

576
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,900
All right, let me clue you in.

577
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,090
We found your SUV at the scene of an attempted kidnapping.

578
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,840
You match our descriptors for a triple homicide.

579
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,510
Your sister admitted to us

580
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,860
that you asked her for cash and a car.

581
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,850
Said you wanted to skip town.

582
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,110
Should I keep going?

583
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,280
'Cause we searched your sister's complex,

584
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,300
found no trace of Tariq.

585
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,530
So why don't we start there, only this time

586
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,580
without the cute?

587
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,030
Where is he?

588
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,800
I don't know.

589
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,390
I-I-I-I don't know, okay?

590
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,720
- Look, it's not what you think. - Okay.

591
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,830
Tariq was going crazy. He put a gun to my head!

592
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,220
He told me he would kill me if I didn't drive him.

593
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,490
I never left the car.

594
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,750
That sounds terrible,

595
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,240
but see, the only problem is, I read your record.

596
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,510
Nia, I know you've been in rooms like this before,

597
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,680
and yet you never been charged.

598
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,310
So this routine, it usually works for you, huh?

599
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,780
Four times a person of interest,

600
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,980
three arrests, zero charges.

601
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,590
You know, the saying goes,

602
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,850
you only get lucky so many times

603
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,790
before cops start thinking you're smart.

604
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,010
- Where's Tariq? - I have no idea.

605
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,670
You were supposed to pick him up.

606
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,580
No, I got away from him.

607
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:00,550
See, we got your phone. You understand that?

608
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,660
I read your texts. I know your plan.

609
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,190
No, no. I was lying to him.

610
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,290
I never even knew what he was up to, I swear--

611
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,400
I think you two wanted a whole new life

612
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,600
on the outside, a perfect family.

613
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,940
Only thing missing:

614
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,840
a baby.

615
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,630
So you two walked into his ex-girlfriend's house

616
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,540
to steal a child.

617
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,240
And when her family tried to defend her,

618
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,210
you murdered every one of them.

619
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,670
I'm sorry.

620
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,150
I don't know anything, okay?

621
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,060
Tariq thought his ex-girlfriend was a bitch,

622
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,760
but the rest is news to me.

623
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,790
I never left the car.

624
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,610
I don't know where he is.

625
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,150
- Any progress on Tariq? - Zero.

626
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,830
Transit teams, state police have been alerted,

627
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,250
but so far, nothing.

628
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,250
Guy's hiding out, waiting for his gal.

629
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,340
What about a lure? We got her cell.

630
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,820
- We could do a bait and switch. - I don't know.

631
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,640
I mean, the texts on her phone made it sound like

632
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,330
she already knew where she was picking Tariq up.

633
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,610
If we change locations now,

634
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,570
chances are, he's gonna know it's us.

635
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,800
Look, it's simple. We need Nia to talk.

636
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,140
We're gonna have to use Makayla as leverage.

637
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,600
I mean, she was at the house.

638
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,390
She can ID her as an active participant.

639
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,370
But I want no legal loopholes.

640
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,990
We jump straight to a lineup,

641
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,660
put Makayla in front of it.

642
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,120
All right, let Burgess know.

643
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,540
Okay, you're gonna look at a line of people,

644
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,990
and then you're just gonna point to the lady

645
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,520
that you saw at your house.

646
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,120
They cannot see you,

647
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,800
and it is gonna go really fast.

648
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,240
Is that okay?

649
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,290
Yeah.

650
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,780
Okay.

651
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,370
If we're waiting all day,

652
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,870
can I at least get a water or something?

653
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,490
No, no, no, no, no.

654
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,400
Hey, hey, look at me. You're okay.

655
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,680
You're okay. Shut the door.

656
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,440
Hey, take a deep breath. Come here.

657
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,840
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

658
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,310
I'm not going anywhere! Come here, come here.

659
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,660
We're not going in there.

660
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,390
She was doing okay.

661
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,300
We'll just go check on her in a little bit.

662
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,500
Kid's all right.

663
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,320
She's with Platt and a paramedic now.

664
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,300
Okay, give her a few hours. Try again.

665
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,820
Or we resort to a photo lineup.

666
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,490
No, I'm not putting her through that.

667
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,280
I'm not putting her through any of that.

668
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,750
If there's a chance it's not good for her,

669
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,230
we don't do it.

670
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,850
Okay, so what's the play?

671
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,320
'Cause we got zero leads on Tariq.

672
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,880
Barely got a murder case on Nia, and she knows it.

673
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,420
Nia doesn't know if Makayla's behind the glass or not.

674
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,550
So you wanna do a lineup anyway.

675
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,120
Yeah, I'll lie my ass off.

676
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,510
Okay.

677
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,350
Just...

678
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:41,850
make it as airtight as you can.

679
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,580
The witness ID'd you from the lineup.

680
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,810
They saw you enter the Ward home,

681
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:53,230
exit the Ward home, and proceed into the backyard,

682
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,860
where you were heard calling a young girl's name:

683
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,980
Makayla.

684
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,170
From the DNA they swabbed from you,

685
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:01,520
they matched half a dozen samples inside the Ward home,

686
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,560
including on the body of one of the victims.

687
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,940
They are still running your SUV,

688
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,920
but they were able to confirm two traces of blood

689
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,170
not visible to the naked eye:

690
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,220
one on the driver's mat

691
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,030
and the other on the passenger seat.

692
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,740
This is quite a lot of evidence, Nia,

693
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,830
more than we hoped for,

694
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:18,900
so it won't matter if you shot anyone yourself.

695
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,120
You were there. You participated.

696
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,950
You will be charged one count of home invasion,

697
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,660
two counts attempted aggravated kidnapping,

698
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,190
and three counts of murder.

699
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,110
So this right here, you and me,

700
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,090
it's gonna be your only chance to help yourself.

701
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,270
I need you to tell me where Tariq is.

702
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,450
Six counts, Nia.

703
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,610
These are charges you do not walk back.

704
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,940
Where is he?

705
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,840
Bitch, I don't believe you.

706
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,860
You don't believe what?

707
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,570
She's gonna keep going.

708
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,210
That this is your last chance?

709
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,600
You understand, right?

710
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,060
I walk out that door, the ball rolls on from here.

711
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,030
You understand that?

712
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,020
Guess I should call my lawyer, then, huh?

713
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,790
Yeah, sure.

714
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,580
Call your lawyer.

715
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:03,750
See, the truth is, Nia,

716
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,480
I don't need your cooperation.

717
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,700
I came in here 'cause I was obligated to.

718
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,170
And I sure as hell was hoping

719
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,300
I wouldn't have to give you a damn thing...

720
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,090
bitch.

721
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,270
Hey, Fernandez?

722
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,720
Patrol officer will be here soon.

723
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,820
He'll take you to booking. You can call your lawyer there.

724
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,220
I'm guessing you'll be transferred out of state

725
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,820
- in the morning. - Out of state?

726
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,920
Mm, Indiana.

727
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,380
Claudia Ward, the grandmother, she was a postal worker.

728
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,590
- Is that true? - No.

729
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,170
What the hell does that matter?

730
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,180
She's a federal employee.

731
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,240
You kill a federal employee,

732
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,810
the government picks up the case.

733
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,780
Federal charges.

734
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,590
You'll be transferred to Terre Haute.

735
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,320
I know Terre Haute.

736
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,160
Don't they have death row at Terre Haute?

737
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,250
They do.

738
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,630
I told you the charges, Nia.

739
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,110
Where'd you think you were going?

740
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,920
No, no.

741
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,040
Nice play.

742
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,110
Fine!

743
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,960
I'll tell you,

744
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,340
but you gotta say I helped.

745
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,650
Upton, you good?

746
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,880
Parked and ready.

747
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,680
All right, heads up, Tariq is coming out.

749
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,630
Nia, you here?

750
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,610
- Gun. - That you?

751
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,860
Move in now.

752
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,260
Chicago PD! Put your hands up!

753
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,380
Put your hands up, Tariq.

754
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,270
Look around, man.

755
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,720
You got six guns trained on you.

756
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,870
It's over.

757
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,200
Put your hands up.

758
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,980
She was my baby.

759
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,160
- She's still your baby. - I just wanted my baby!

760
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,800
They took her from me, man!

761
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,980
Tariq, you listen to me.

762
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,420
You calm down, all right?

763
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,170
You raise that gun even a little, you will be shot,

764
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,820
and not once.

765
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,600
Every cop here is gonna shoot,

766
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,070
and that is six bullets.

767
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,960
After everything you did,

768
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,880
I don't think that's how you want this thing to end:

769
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:43,870
bleeding out in the dirt,

770
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,760
never seeing your baby girl again.

771
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,390
Tariq, you listen to me.

772
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,210
You toss that gun, you still have a chance

773
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,690
'cause you still got a kid,

774
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:52,160
that kid's still got a father,

775
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,400
and you are still alive.

776
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,950
Toss that gun.

777
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,580
You toss that gun, Tariq!

778
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,850
On your knees!

779
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,320
Drop the phone!

780
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,580
I'm never gonna see her again, am I?

781
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,460
I sure as hell hope not.

782
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,660
Ooh, didn't expect that.

783
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,020
DCFS tracked down Makayla's family.

784
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,120
- Cousin's on the way. - Oh, that's great.

785
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,150
You know, it's your instincts that got the case

786
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,580
and protected her.

787
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,640
It's good work.

788
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,230
You could let it count for something.

789
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,860
What?

790
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,010
I don't know. I was just thinking.

791
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,130
About what?

792
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,790
When we got pregnant.

793
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,420
I'm a cop.

794
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,970
I love being a cop. I'm good at it.

795
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,730
I didn't think I'd have the instincts to be a mom too.

796
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,490
And then what happened happened.

797
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,430
No, you would've been good at both.

798
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,730
You're always giving me the benefit of the doubt.

799
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,740
No, I'm not. I know you.

800
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,260
You would've had instincts for all of it.

801
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,390
That's all.

802
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,870
That's just how it is.

803
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,120
Yeah.

804
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,710
Maybe it makes you better at both.

805
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,270
Are we hanging tonight or what?

806
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,340
I don't know. Can you stand the monotony?

807
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:33,560
Yeah, you know what? About that, I spoke to Barkey.

808
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,860
Apparently, that boat was not his to sell.

809
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,510
He stole the boat?

810
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,920
No, he won it in a not-so-legitimate parlay.

811
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,170
He did steal that boat.

812
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,440
He stole it.

813
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,720
I will meet you at the bar.

814
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,540
- I'm gonna wait with Makayla. - All right.

815
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,850
See, mine don't do it.

816
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,310
Got all your stuff, okay? So don't worry about that.

817
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,710
- Look who's here. - Kathy!

818
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,190
- Hi, I'm Kathy Ward. - Hi.

819
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,950
- Kim Burgess. - Good to meet you.

820
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,740
You too. This is her stuff.

821
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,770
Okay.

822
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,810
And here's my card.

823
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,730
You call if you need anything or if you wanna keep in touch.

824
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,180
- Thank you. - Yeah.

825
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,720
All right, let's do this.

826
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,220
Just rip the Band-Aid off.

827
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,290
What did the FBI offer you?

828
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,640
Hmm, okay.

829
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,790
Joint level task force with the HIG.

830
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,690
All interrogations. All high-level targets.

831
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,180
Sure. Sure, sure, sure.

832
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,690
Yeah, that sounds awesome.

833
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,750
- Is it good pay? - It's great pay.

834
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,660
Honestly, it made me a little embarrassed

835
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,090
about what we get paid.

836
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,030
Well, you'd probably be really good at it.

837
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,880
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

838
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,530
You liked it out there, right?

839
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,000
I don't know if I liked it.

840
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,730
I think it was just what I needed at the time.

841
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,060
Okay, but you don't need it now?

842
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,240
No, why? You think I need it?

843
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,580
Are you trying to tell me I should take it?

844
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,900
No, uh...

845
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,490
I'm saying that it's a good job for a good cop.

846
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,780
You could tell me you don't want me to take it.

847
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,430
It was an option.

848
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,210
I want you to do whatever you wanna do.

849
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,820
I'm just practicing self-preservation here.

850
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,780
The agent on the phone said the only reason

851
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,420
a good cop doesn't take a job like this

852
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,900
is 'cause they're scared,

853
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,710
implying that I'm afraid of change

854
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,150
and I wanted to stay here where it's safe.

855
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,670
So he's a dick.

856
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,550
I don't think that's why I don't wanna take it.

857
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,910
I don't wanna take it because of you.

858
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,320
I'm better...

859
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,680
with you as my partner.

860
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,240
You know, you, 21, with Voight.

861
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,890
I know I'm better here.

862
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,440
So I'm not gonna take it.

863
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,310
You sure?

864
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,060
Yeah.

865
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,640
All set.

866
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,340
He wasn't really wrong, though, was he?

867
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:16,320
You gain something. You give something up.

868
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,880
Maybe, but...not always.

869
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,740
It's been a long time

870
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,150
since I saw you as just my partner.
