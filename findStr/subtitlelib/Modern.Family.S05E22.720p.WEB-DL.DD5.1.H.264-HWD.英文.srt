1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,270
Oh, New Yorker, you've done it again.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,500
Jay, check out this cartoon.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,700
Does it have a talking dog?

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,510
- No, it's a commentary on... - I'm out.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,820
Here you go,

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,730
one of my best efforts.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,500
Have at it.

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,630
Mm, I can't eat that.

9
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,960
- Why not? - The pickle's touching it.

10
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,850
There.

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,960
The juice got on the bread and, ew, what's that stuff?

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,800
Spices.

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,410
They look like sea monkeys.

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,110
Have you ever really examine a jar of pickles, Jay?

15
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,210
It's like a swamp there. I'll pass.

16
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,790
What happened?

17
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,970
I made him a beautiful sandwich and he won't eat it.

18
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,140
Yeah, 'cause it had pickles on it.

19
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,990
Joe is taking a nap.

20
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,190
I'm gonna go to the dry cleaners.

21
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,460
Well, if you're passing a sushi restaurant --

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,200
She's not.

23
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,280
I've never heard of anyone not liking pickles.

24
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,650
Aw, big day for you, then.

25
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,830
I'm just gonna make myself a grilled cheese.

26
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,290
I think I saw some Gruye in there.

27
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,230
Do we have any fig?

28
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,180
Sit down.

29
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,290
This whole persnickety thing is not gonna fly in the world.

30
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,380
Never hand people another reason to make fun of you.

31
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,590
You mean like all the cool kids

32
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,060
with their leather jackets and their pickles?

33
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,550
Well, you're gonna sit there

34
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,840
until you at least try a pickle.

35
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,960
You're drunk with power.

36
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,740
You got that right.

41
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,470
- Oh, no. - What?

42
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,850
The Tonys are coming.

43
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,020
Cam, this is exactly why I don't want you watching them --

44
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,190
You're already so angry.

45
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,380
Not that Tonys --

46
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,630
Anthony Lamarque, botox Tony.

47
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,390
They're coming to the wedding.

48
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,530
But, seriously, another revival of "Anything Goes"?

49
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,290
Are we really doing this again?

50
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,740
I'm surprised that they're coming,

51
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,070
because when I mentioned the wedding to Tony,

52
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,730
he seemed completely disinterested --

53
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,820
Oh, the botox.

54
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,850
Oh, no.

55
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,040
Your cousin Pete, all of his kids.

56
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,890
Everyone's accepting, Mitchell!

57
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,830
We haven't even gotten the list from my dad yet.

58
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,340
And your dad's friends drink like soldiers.

59
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,850
Because they were soldiers.

60
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,280
I mean, I am grateful for their service,

61
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,370
but we are not gonna be able to afford this wedding.

62
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,090
Okay, maybe we need to pull back on a few things.

63
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,760
Like what?

64
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,340
Uh, the centerpieces?

65
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,470
Why even have a wedding?

66
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,240
I don't know, Cam.

67
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,620
Because we love and respect each other

68
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,960
and we're raising a child together?

69
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,500
Do you want to help or not?

70
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,520
Maybe we could send un-vitations.

71
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Is that a thing?

72
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,570
We've already made a lot of people angry

73
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,000
by just being able to get married.

74
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,340
Let's not alienate the ones on our side.

75
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,350
All right. Maybe we could sell something.

76
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,260
We're thousands over budget.

77
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,430
It would have to be something great.

78
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,480
Here, you can sell my diamond ring.

79
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,300
Oh, honey, that's candy.

80
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,910
I'm gonna kill that Jackson!

81
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,560
I do have something of value --

82
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,030
A "Spider-man versus doctor octopus" comic book.

83
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,740
Issue number 3, 1963, near-mint condition.

84
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,220
It's worth 5 grand.

85
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,110
I traded a football for it when I was 9 years old,

86
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,070
and my dad was mad

87
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,830
because the football was signed by Dan Marino.

88
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,610
I said, "Get it signed by Rita Moreno, and I'll keep it."

89
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,860
Oh, no.

90
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,910
My nephews are flying in from Tulsa

91
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,700
-- the big ones.

92
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,150
The pie eaters?

93
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,430
That's it. I got to sell my Wyatt Earp.

94
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
This here is a belt buckle once worn

95
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,400
by the great Wyatt Earp.

96
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,710
My grandpa gave it to me when I was 7 years old,

97
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,280
and he said,"Son, this will keep the bad guys away."

98
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,750
In my early 20s, I wore it to

99
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,970
a Cowboys-and-Indians disco party.

100
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,230
And let's just say it didn't.

101
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,200
No. I can't let you do that.

102
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,330
That means the world to you.

103
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,310
Cam, I will sell my "Spider-man."

104
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,920
Mitchell, my belt buckle was owned

105
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,860
by a legend of the old west.

106
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,800
I don't think your comic book

107
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,450
would even cover our balloon budget.

108
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,930
Well, that's very offens--

109
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,140
Wait. What's the balloon budget?

110
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,210
Hey, mom, can we put this stuff somewhere else?

111
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,460
It's cluttering up my room.

112
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,370
What is it?

113
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,370
Oh, just some mementos of mine.

114
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,940
A few of your dad's.

115
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,270
- Oh, Zima! - Yeah.

116
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,150
What's Zima?

117
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,900
Just a party in a bottle.

118
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,510
Man, that reminds me of some wild times.

119
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,580
Cranking the Bjork in my Saturn

120
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,070
before me and my buddies snuck some "Z"

121
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,570
into "Sleepless in Seattle."

122
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,480
I wish you'd covered my ears for that.

123
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,150
Ooh, mom. Who's this hottie with his arm around you?

124
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,800
Cute!

125
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,820
Oh, that's Bobby Nash, my old boyfriend.

126
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,850
Why'd you break up with him? For dad?

127
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,130
Let's just say he took his eye

128
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,970
off the ball and struck out.

129
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,190
So I stepped up to the plate

130
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,540
and nailed her in the cheap seats.

131
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,680
Yeah, let's not say that.

132
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,100
Well, I'm off.

133
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,790
Oh, honey, I've got to stop by the drug store.

134
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,870
Do you need anything?

135
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,930
No, thank you, my dear.

136
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,850
The Dunphy glands produce all the drugs I need.

137
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,180
Except for, uh, foot spray.

138
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,320
Could you grab me some of that?

139
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
Sure.

140
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,950
Oh, wow, mom!

141
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,800
What a dork, right?

142
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,810
What were you thinking?

143
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,590
It was comfortable. My dad didn't approve.

144
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,730
Enough said.

145
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,320
I know it's hard to believe,

146
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,270
but I was actually a bit of a nerd back in the day.

147
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,990
And it was suggested that I was out of my league

148
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,190
when I landed Claire.

149
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,690
By Jay, mostly.

150
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,780
And my friends. A-and my parents.

151
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,810
And Claire.

152
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,000
What's this?

153
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,510
Oh, my gosh.

154
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,740
That is your father's answering machine from college.

155
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,690
God, I sometimes forget how old you guys are.

156
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,940
You've reached Phil's world!

157
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,440
Party time! Excellent!

158
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,760
He's so cute.

159
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,560
Hi, Phil. This is Mitchell,

160
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,580
uh, Pritchett, Claire's brother.

161
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,890
I just wanted to thank you for setting me up with your cousin.

162
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,480
She was very nice.

163
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,700
The only problem is she lives kinda far, so...

164
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,430
That's the only problem?

165
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,980
Hey, Dunph-dog, it's Ling.

166
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,710
Grab your rollerblades

167
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,250
and meet us at the bike path, playa!

168
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,310
But I got to be done by 3:00,

169
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,760
'cause today's the day I fly my new helicopter.

170
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,790
Phil, hey, it's Claire. Um...

171
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,020
I need to tell you something,

172
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,970
and I don't want to do it on your machine.

173
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,440
It's really important --

174
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
- Oh, no, no, no. - You know, life-and-death important.

175
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,050
Come on. Come on.

176
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,600
Not death, um, just life.

177
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,900
I mean... I just -- oh, hell, I'm pregnant!

178
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,590
Oh, sweet newlyweds!

179
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,470
Don't worry. You don't have to marry me or anything.

180
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,010
Let's talk as soon as you can.

181
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,650
Why weren't we more careful?

182
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,440
Stupid Duran Duran concert.

183
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,380
All right!

184
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,420
That's enough.

185
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,280
I was conceived at a Duran Duran concert?

186
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,240
Classy start to a classy life.

187
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,420
You were not conceived at the concert.

188
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,960
It was after the concert.

189
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,700
Oh, wha-- in the car?!

190
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,150
It was a very nice car.

191
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,250
Listen, I am done. Stop snooping. I'm going.

192
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,440
The seats folded all the way back.

193
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,910
Oh, images.

194
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,960
I can't believe they kept it.

195
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,010
I have a name.

196
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,430
The answering machine.

197
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,740
You know, we could have some fun with this.

198
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,470
I'm home!

199
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,850
Hi, mom.

200
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,520
Manny, what are you doing sitting in front of a pickle?

201
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,850
Jay says I can't leave until I taste it.

202
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,050
Why do you torture him like this?

203
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,020
'Cause he's too stuck in his ways, Gloria.

204
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,550
This is good for him.

205
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,770
He'll taste the pickle, he'll find that he likes it,

206
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,070
he'll try more things.

207
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,740
This is good parenting.

208
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,000
This is not going to play well in my memoir.

209
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,640
You know, you're one to talk.

210
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,160
How many times have I asked you

211
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,890
to try my mother's blood sausages?

212
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,670
Totally different. That's disgusting.

213
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,010
How do you know it's disgusting if you've never tried it?

214
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,700
You've never tried grandma's delicious blood sausage

215
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,710
that's right there in the freezer?

216
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,790
Oh, you're right.

217
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,110
We do have some left over.

218
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,620
Really? It hasn't been all gobbled up yet?

219
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,170
Okay, Mr. Father of the year,

220
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,680
time for you to show Manny that you're not a hypocrite.

221
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,980
Looks like you're in quite a conundrum.

222
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,960
You know, you could've said --

223
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,280
"A pickle"! Dang it! It was right there.

224
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,790
Hello.

225
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,760
Hi. Can I help you?

226
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,260
Uh, yes.

227
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,820
Um, I have something pretty special

228
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,390
that means the world to me,

229
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,550
yet I gladly part with it

230
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,100
to prove my love for my fiance

231
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,930
- Cam, you don't have to... - I do.

232
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,460
This is a belt buckle that was once owned

233
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,070
by the legendary Wyatt Earp.

234
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,990
And when my grandfather gave it to me, and rest his soul,

235
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,050
Are you ok?

236
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,060
I can't be here for this. You do it.

237
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,010
And get a price on that divine lamp.

238
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,840
Um, anyway...

239
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,020
Look, I didn't want to say anything

240
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,870
in front of your fiance

241
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,270
but this is a cheap replica

242
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,850
given away by a gas-station chain in the '60s.

243
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,350
There's tons of them out there.

244
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,040
It's worth about 20 bucks.

245
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,100
Are you sure?

246
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,690
Pretty sure.

247
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,780
That family loves to dress up a story.

248
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,300
And a pig.

249
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,210
Well, how about a first-edition number 3

250
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,720
"Spider-man versus doctor octopus" in near-mint condition?

251
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,630
Keep talking.

252
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:19,700
That...

253
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,160
Uh, uh, that's pretty much it.

254
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,540
Why isn't she calling?

255
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,430
Aren't you the doubter?

256
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,660
She'll call in three...

257
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,090
two-o-o-o...

258
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,750
One! One's next!

259
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
Yeah.

260
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,970
Press record.

261
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,840
Hi, mom.

262
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,000
Haley, honey,

263
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,720
did you mean to send this text to your dad?

264
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,430
Text? What does it say?

265
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,220
"I hate to spoil your golf game, but..."

266
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,590
Uh, no, no. I-I didn't send that.

267
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,120
Must have accidentally dictated

268
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,620
when you and dad were talking.

269
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,110
Okay. That's weird.

270
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,440
Well, while I have you on the phone,

271
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,290
would you mind emptying the dishwasher and doing --

272
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,590
Oh, you're breaking up.

273
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,760
Haley, can you hear me now?

274
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,840
Nope. Bye.

275
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,880
- Got it. - Told you we'd get it.

276
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,930
Now just for a little creative editing...

277
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,420
Your mind is so brilliant.

278
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,990
If you put this much effort into your schoolwork,

279
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,430
there is no telling the things you could --

280
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,120
Why do you have to ruin everything?

281
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,690
I know, she's always talking about my potential.

282
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,170
Fore!

283
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,170
Do you think I hit her?

284
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,450
Nah, she's fine.

285
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,780
Sorry I'm so distracted today.

286
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,810
What's wrong, buddy?

287
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,550
Let me ask you something.

288
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,060
Do -- do you ever get the sense

289
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,790
that your wife feels like she could have done better?

290
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,360
God, no. Nah, she's the luckiest woman on earth.

291
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,990
I mean, if anything, I could've done better.

292
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,090
The noises that come out of that woman at night?

293
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,630
It's like she's that black guy from "Police Academy."

294
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,840
Oh, speak of the devil.

295
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,640
Message from my wife,

296
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,310
not the black guy from "Police Academy."

297
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,640
Oh, that'd be so awesome.

298
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,680
That would be neat.

299
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,650
Phil? Hey, it's Claire.

300
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,330
Um, I hate to spoil your golf game, but...

301
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,290
I'm pregnant!

302
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:57,860
What?

303
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,290
Let's talk as soon as you can.

304
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,720
I have to leave.

305
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,410
What? We're in the middle of a game.

306
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,590
I have to be with Claire!

307
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,090
Oh -- my clubs!

308
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,760
My hat!

309
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,040
My sandwich!

310
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,520
I'm sorry I freaked out in there.

311
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,730
How -- how much did we get for it?

312
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,100
You know, here. I couldn't do it.

313
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,080
What? No.

314
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,800
This belt buckle means so much to you.

315
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,560
I'm just gonna -- I am going to sell my comic book instead.

316
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,530
Oh, Mitchell, that is so sweet. You know --

317
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,380
The idea of me parting ways with a belt buckle

318
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,400
that my grandfather arm-wrestled Wyatt Earp for --

319
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,070
He arm-wrestled him?

320
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,850
Oh, yeah, but not in a contentious way.

321
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,970
You know, they were friends.

322
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,280
My grandfather saved his life during a train robbery.

323
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,760
A -- a train robbery? That's -- wow.

324
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,140
Cam, wow!

325
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,540
They had a real bond.

326
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,210
The great Wyatt Earp and honest Abe Tucker.

327
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,560
I have it, I'll store it,

328
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,740
and if I need to, I will use it.

329
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,140
You know what? I quit.

330
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,220
Pardon me for trying to broaden his horizons.

331
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,710
No, no, no. You're not quitting anything.

332
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,870
You're going to eat your sausage,

333
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,310
and you're going to eat your pickle.

334
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,590
I am tired of every day cooking two different meals.

335
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,640
No tomatoes. White meat only. Extra bacon.

336
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,570
He gets extra bacon? What the hell?

337
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,940
Today is the day you two are stopping this silliness!

338
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,510
Fine, we'll all conquer something today.

339
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,050
What do I have to conquer? I eat everything.

340
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,710
- Pet Stella's belly. - What?

341
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,530
You won't touch Stella's belly.

342
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,770
Yeah, because it's the creepiest thing ever.

343
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,210
Has like 30 nipples.

344
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,590
I'll eat the blood sausage,

345
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,260
Manny eats the pickles,

346
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,160
you pet her belly.

347
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,320
I'd rather eat the dog.

348
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,010
Don't be a hypocrite.

349
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,550
Nice and long, like you mean it.

350
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,970
I want to see that leg shake.

351
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,580
- Let me get these! - What's happening?

352
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,220
- I'm just so happy! - Really?

353
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,830
Oh, did you finally get a hole in one?

354
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,690
A hole in one.

355
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,810
I hope our baby has your sense of humor.

356
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,620
- Our what? - Why didn't I see it?

357
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,190
The drug store, the bloated ankles,

358
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,360
you've been so moody lately...

359
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,440
What are you talking about?

360
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,280
There it is.

361
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,840
Phil, I am not pregnant.

362
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,160
- You're not? - No.

363
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,390
Well, why'd you leave me that message?

364
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,240
Didn't leave you a message.

365
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,980
Are you sure? You're very forgetful when you're pregnant.

366
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,490
I think I would remember!

367
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,530
Then why have you been so moody?

368
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,110
Maybe because you just told me I have giant ankles!

369
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,780
Shh, I don't want him to hear us fight like this.

370
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,830
Give me this.

371
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,270
Okay. This is gonna be good for everybody,

372
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,400
So let's get it over with.

373
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,620
- Fine. - Okay.

374
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,930
We'll go on the count of three.

375
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,770
One...

376
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,320
Two...

377
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,200
Three.

378
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,270
Uh! Oh, no!

379
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,370
I'm gonna throw up!

380
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,060
Why so moist, Jay?! Why?!

381
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,230
Is this a bad time?

382
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,410
Sorry to barge in here like this.

383
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,760
I guess it's weird that, uh, I'm still storing stuff here.

384
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,410
I just wish you would have come in sooner

385
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,180
before I went to second base with Stella.

386
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,980
All right, I'll be two minutes.

387
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,320
If you need money for the wedding,

388
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,960
why sell something that you love?

389
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,350
Why don't you just ask Jay?

390
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,060
No. No. No. No.

391
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,270
Why not? He's your father.

392
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,440
I don't feel right asking my dad for money, okay?

393
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm an adult, and I have my comic book.

394
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,720
I hate to spoil your golf game, but...

395
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,570
I'm pregnant!

396
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,760
Let's talk as soon as you can.

397
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,670
Oh, they are good.

398
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,360
I can't believe they pulled such an elaborate stunt.

399
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,310
I don't know whether to be angry or impressed.

400
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,510
It's so diabolical.

401
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,280
I don't know where they get that...

402
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,150
Wait. Wait. Wait.

403
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,420
We could really have some fun with this.

404
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,960
You know, it's funny,

405
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,830
I never saw you as a comic-book guy.

406
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,590
Oh, no, I wasn't, but I don't know.

407
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,630
Spider-man --

408
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,370
He -- he spoke to me.

409
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,580
I -- I think it's because it's about this nerdy kid

410
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,930
who has this special secret side of himself

411
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,680
that he can't share with anybody, and --

412
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,430
And that's how I always felt.

413
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,660
Spider-man made me feel like it was okay to be different.

414
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,750
And...it made me feel tough enough to --

415
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,150
to get through the rough times.

416
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,140
Oh, Mitchell, that's so sweet.

417
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,930
I didn't know that.

418
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:59,110
Are you sure you want to sell it?

419
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,070
Yes, yes.

420
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,490
Because, like Spider-man, I am brave and strong.

421
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,960
- Oh! Spider web! Spider web! - Mitchell.

422
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,070
It's in my mouth.

423
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,920
- Oh, Mitchell! - What?! Oh!

424
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,190
No! No! Oh, no!

425
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,790
Give me a break, Phil!

426
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,690
What do you want from me?!

427
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,220
- Shh! - I didn't say anything.

428
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,890
A little compassion when you thought I was pregnant

429
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,970
would have been nice!

430
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,630
I'm sorry. It was a knee-jerk reaction.

431
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,340
You got that half right!

432
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,920
Well, you're not pregnant, anyway, so who cares?!

433
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
And what did I say that was so terrible?!

434
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,930
Well, I believe your exact words were,

435
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,050
Oh, I'm sorry. But we both know that's true.

436
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,500
Wait. Are you saying we never should have them in the first place.

437
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,990
Like you never said that!

438
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,040
This is awful.

439
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,430
This is what you thought gonna happen?

440
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,800
I didn't think that far ahead.

441
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,740
I never do. You know that.

442
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,960
You should've stopped me!

443
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,430
You said this was going to be fun!

444
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,940
Nobody is having fun!

445
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,490
Careful?! Please, Phil!

446
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,840
If you hadn't gotten me pregnant,

447
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,210
I never would have married you!

448
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,700
I would have married Bobby Nash!

449
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,010
- You would?! - Oh, yeah!

450
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,530
And right now, I would be on my 100-acre ranch in Aspen

451
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:04,200
with my strapping 6'4" hedge-fund husband!

452
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,430
You really wish you'd married Bobby?

453
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,290
Oh, every single day!

454
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,900
No, Phil.

455
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,660
Dad, are you okay?

456
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,570
Yep.

457
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,020
That's what I am to everyone around here.

458
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,350
- Mom... - Just "Okay."

459
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,380
- Phil! - Hey, mom?

460
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,980
- Not now. - Phil!

461
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,590
You guys hear that? We totally got them!

462
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,710
Quick! We need a blow dryer!

463
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,500
Is this some sort of gay emergency?

464
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,690
No, dad, it's not a gay emergency!

465
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,530
It's my comic book.

466
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,330
We need to -- ohh, god!

467
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,370
It's ruined.

468
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,250
Mitchell, it's okay.

469
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,030
It probably wasn't worth that much anyway.

470
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,560
It was worth $5,000! Your belt buckle is garbage.

471
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,700
It came from a gas station!

472
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,600
Your grandfather never met Wyatt Earp!

473
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,870
I didn't hold on to that for quite as long as I thought.

474
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,340
Hey, I'm sorry.

475
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,870
I -- I didn't mean to blurt it out like that.

476
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,190
No, it's -- it's okay.

477
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,650
I -- I kinda suspected the dates didn't line up.

478
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,000
Now I'm starting to think that wasn't

479
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,790
Amelia Earhart's compass.

480
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,250
I'm so sorry, but I am sure that Jay can help you two out.

481
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,380
No, no, no, no, no.

482
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,590
We want to do this on our own.

483
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,120
Can I ask you a question?

484
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,270
Why are you having such a big thing anyway?

485
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,330
Well, because we're only getting married once.

486
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,410
I'm just saying, why do you need to make into a spectacle?

487
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,340
A s-- a spectacle?

488
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,500
This could be the universe's way of telling you

489
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,960
to bring it down a notch.

490
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,360
Invite your family, your friend Pepper,

491
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,450
and, what's his name, the -- the -- the flouncy one?

492
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,400
Uh, L'david.

493
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,990
I don't have a flouncy friend named L'david, dad.

494
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,850
Do -- do you mean L'michael or J'marcus?

495
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,250
I'm not sure who you're referring to.

496
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,770
Whatever.

497
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,470
I'm just saying keep it small.

498
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,560
Why pay all that money for people you barely know?

499
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,780
Oh, oh, you mean like any of your friends?

500
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,200
Oh, please, you don't want any of my friends there.

501
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,940
Really? Because I've --

502
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,680
I've been asking for a list for months now.

503
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,330
So, so who doesn't want them there --

504
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,730
me or you?

505
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:46,810
Why are you getting upset?

506
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,730
Because, dad, if -- if this was Claire's wedding,

507
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,780
you would be all over it.

508
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,630
You'd be wanting to have it at your club.

509
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,810
You'd be inviting all your friends.

510
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,550
Oh, please!

511
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,930
I wasn't that thrilled when Claire got married, either.

512
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,360
"Either"? For god's sake, just stop talking.

513
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,790
Everybody back off.

514
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,250
I don't think I'm out of line

515
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,120
suggesting my friends don't want to see

516
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
a father-son dance at a big gay wedding.

517
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,340
There is no father-son dance, dad.

518
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,520
I don't know what things go on there.

519
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,910
Do I walk you down the aisle?

520
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,550
Does someone throw a bouquet?

521
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,390
I mean, I'm just saying, I don't know

522
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,940
how this stuff plays out

523
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,110
with my guys from the club.

524
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,770
Oh, you mean the guys who sit around the locker room

525
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,140
watching football naked?

526
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,120
No! No! See, this -- this isn't about them.

527
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,040
This is about you.

528
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,750
You are the one that's uncomfortable here.

529
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,460
Fine. I admit it.

530
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,350
This whole wedding thing is weird to me.

531
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,950
Now, see, why do you get to be you,

532
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,400
but I don't get to be me?

533
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,230
See, I didn't choose to be uncomfortable.

534
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,170
I was born this way.

535
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,610
Are you really throwing a gay anthem in our face right now?

536
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,850
Oh, damn it. Give me some credit.

537
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,380
You know how far I've come.

538
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,900
I mean, what more do you want from me?

539
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,100
You know what, dad? Y-you do.

540
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,120
You do get to be you.

541
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,430
If -- if it really makes you that uncomfortable, then...

542
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,750
don't come to the wedding.

543
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,670
Mitchell...

544
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,770
No! No, see? We're scaling back already.

545
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,800
Phil, honey...

546
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,650
What happened down there?

547
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,590
You attacked me.

548
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,810
In a fun way. We were both doing it.

549
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,680
I heard you this morning,

550
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,860
Talking about your super-cute boyfriend Bobby,

551
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,290
saying that I was the "Comfortable" choice,

552
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,170
that you only married me because your dad hated it.

553
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,030
No, sweetheart.

554
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,960
I was not talking about you.

555
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,040
I was explaining to the girls

556
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,250
about an outfit that I was wearing in a picture

557
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,260
that was the comfortable choice

558
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,650
that my dad hated.

559
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,320
Oh, honey.

560
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,490
You can't possibly think that's why I married you.

561
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,760
Okay, I -- I get it a-about your dad.

562
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,360
I -- I -- sometimes I do wonder, you know,

563
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,740
if you hadn't gotten pregnant...

564
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,420
- would we even be here right now? - Yeah.

565
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,580
Well, I wonder the same thing, too.

566
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,850
You do?

567
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,610
Yes. All the time.

568
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,650
Just last week,

569
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,710
you and the kids were outside washing the car,

570
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,660
and you got in that soap battle

571
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,410
and everybody was running around laughing.

572
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,310
And I stood there at the kitchen window,

573
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,910
and I was thinking how lucky I am.

574
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,040
'cause I would have missed all of this

575
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,440
if I hadn't married you.

576
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,450
I knew you were watching.

577
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,920
That's why I dropped the sponge.

578
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,250
That's what got my attention in the first place.

579
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,570
You really don't regret not marrying Bobby Nash?

580
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,370
No.

581
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,130
He was cute, but he was boring.

582
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,940
He never once made me laugh.

583
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,360
You laugh at me all the time.

584
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,820
I do.

585
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,390
I liked how happy you were

586
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,090
when you thought I was pregnant.

587
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,840
Of course I was.

588
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,380
Do you think you could pick that up for me?

589
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,900
I don't know.

590
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,170
It's so far down here.

591
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,730
See? I told you they were gonna be fine.

592
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,060
- Door lock! - Run!

593
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,660
Go! Go! Go! Go!

594
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,580
Hey, Phil, it's Mitchell, Claire's brother.

595
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,990
I heard about your and Claire's whole pregnancy situation,

596
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,130
And I'm -- I'm sorry my dad didn't have a better reaction.

597
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,970
Don't take it personally.

598
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,970
He's just like that.

599
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,230
He'll -- he'll come around.

600
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,240
And if not...

601
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,660
His loss.

602
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,300
Yeah, okay, anyway,

603
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,190
uh, now that we're gonna be family,

604
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,410
it's -- it's probably a little weird for me to date your cousin,

605
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,320
so maybe you could ask her to stop paging me?

606
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,060
It's so crazy.

607
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,750
I know. Uncle Mitchell with a pager.

608
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,280
No, Stella. Okay? No!

609
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,880
Stella, I said no.

610
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,490
You...

611
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,780
Okay, but just this time, okay?

612
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,220
And you keep your mouth shut about this.

613
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,590
Who's there?
