18
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,220
Wes Keeler, 49,

19
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,860
pricked in the upper right arm by a cactus four days ago.

20
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,640
Temp 102.5.

21
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,470
Wound is seriously infected.

22
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,960
He was leading a camping trip on Mount Thayer.

23
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,560
We couldn't leave 'em up there alone.

24
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,150
BP's 86/51. Tachycardic.

25
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,450
Rapid, shallow breathing.

26
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,510
Signs of sepsis.

27
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:20,590
You gonna have to cut his arm off?

28
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,560
I'll be fine!

29
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,250
We need to debride the wound stat!

30
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,820
Shaun, I've been looking all over for you.

31
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,730
Hey, uh, h-how about getting some breakfast?

32
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,310
Some pancakes?

33
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,130
No. I'm not hungry.

34
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,340
Okay.

35
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,890
How about coming over for dinner tonight?

36
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:46,790
Is Debbie making lasagna?

37
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,360
She could.

38
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,520
No, thank you.

39
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,550
Okay, Shaun.

40
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,040
Can we just stop and -- and talk for just a minute?

41
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,000
Why are-- aren't you, uh, responding to my texts?

42
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,030
Are you upset?

43
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,940
- Are you sad because of Lea? - Yes. Yes.

44
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,480
I am very sad.

45
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,240
But it will be okay.

46
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,410
Yeah, of course it'll be okay.

47
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,340
I'm still going to be with Lea.

48
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,120
Wait. What?

49
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,740
She said she loves me.

50
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,030
She also gave you a hundred reasons

51
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,040
- why she can't be with you, Shaun. - Yes. Yes.

52
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,670
She gave me very specific reasons

53
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,170
why we can't be together,

54
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,480
but I've overcome other challenges...

55
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,830
- No, Shaun, it's not -- - ...to become a good doctor, a good friend.

56
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,400
it's not about overcoming challenges.

57
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,810
It's not about you.

58
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,110
It's about Lea.

59
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,750
I can't take two steps without falling down.

60
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,520
Is the issue balance or weakness?

61
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,310
All of the above.

62
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,760
Fatigue, dizziness, light-headedness, headaches,

63
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,210
occasional bouts of nausea.

64
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,270
And when d--

65
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,850
Five years ago, just after the birth of my daughter.

66
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,220
And there's no discernible fluctuation

67
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,090
based on time of day or time of the month.

68
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,750
Temp 98.2. BP 111/78.

69
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,520
That'll drop to 80/50 when I'm upright.

70
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,620
I don't drink, smoke, or take drugs.

71
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,460
I haven't traveled outside of the country in the last 10 years.

72
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,120
And there's no family history of a similar condition.

73
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,970
You've been through this before.

74
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,480
17 times. 18 if you count the naturopath in Seattle.

75
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,520
Which I don't.

76
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,780
No one has been able to give me a diagnosis.

77
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,630
We need to do an EKG and stress test,

78
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,110
get a CT of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

79
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,670
Let me save you some time.

80
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,640
Five years' worth of tests, labs, scans, reports...

81
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,850
...my entire medical odyssey.

82
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,550
Fun.

85
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,040
Set up in the lounge

86
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,420
and get me copies of each of those --

87
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,060
Claire!

88
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,690
Dash. Oh, my God!

89
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,260
Why are you here?

90
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,940
Uh, you changed your number.

91
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,650
Right. Um, it's a long story.

92
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,830
Uh, Dash, you remember Dr. Melendez, Dr. Murphy?

93
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,680
Yeah, of course.

94
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,300
Uh, you gave my wife six more good months.

95
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,180
We considered renaming our cat after you.

96
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,140
That would have been foolish. Cats remember their names.

97
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,530
Sorry for your loss. Wish we could've done more.

98
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,400
Let you two catch up.

99
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,080
I think the infection spread quickly

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,460
because of the underlying damage to your liver and kidney.

101
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,990
We'll need to keep you on a prolonged course of IV antibiotics.

102
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,470
Hey, you hear that, guys?

103
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,660
Hep C and heroin aren't as much fun as they sound.

104
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,130
Although one was more fun than the other...

105
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,860
for a while.

106
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,640
Don't they have somewhere else to go?

107
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,940
Not likely.

108
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,160
Most of them haven't seen their parents in years,

109
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,300
so they're with me --

110
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,450
survivalist training program for at-risk youth.

111
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,710
We prefer "Young adults with unrealized potential."

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,810
I'm supposed to be teaching these yahoos responsibility and...

113
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,550
good decision-making.

114
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,190
Hell of an example.

115
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,390
He's got a new murmur.

116
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,960
BP's dropping.

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,700
Wes, we need to take a look at your heart.

118
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,840
Wes, the infection's spread.

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,470
It's damaged your aortic valve.

120
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,060
You need emergency surgery.

122
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,110
What about vasculitis?

123
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
Or dysautonomia?

124
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,040
Both are consistent with weakness and fatigue.

125
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,730
Her temporal artery biopsy was negative.

126
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,280
That rules out vasculitis.

127
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,200
And I thought I saw something about dysautonomia in here.

128
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,980
There are 15 different causes of dysautonomia.

129
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,230
Seven have been ruled out.

130
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,910
The rest are inconsistent with Alice's symptoms

131
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,310
or have no definitive diagnostic test.

132
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,590
How did you make Dr. Lim fall in love with you

133
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,650
after you had been friends for so long?

134
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,990
I assume that's directed at you.

135
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,130
I don't think you make anyone fall in love with you, Shaun.

136
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,280
It unfolds naturally over time.

137
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,180
That's not true.

138
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,300
Everyone starts off not loving you.

139
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,080
Then you say and do things that make them love you.

140
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,270
Or not. That's the point of romance.

141
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,740
But romance is harder

142
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,140
if you're already friends with the person.

143
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,630
You can't hide the less attractive parts of yourself.

144
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,580
It can be an advantage.

145
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,580
You already know what pisses them off.

146
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,690
That's very true.

147
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:54,290
Shaun...

148
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,450
did Carly tell you she just wants to be friends?

149
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,050
Or are you talking about someone else?

150
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,300
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

151
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm -- I'm looking for my dad.

152
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,870
- I just -- I'm here visiting, and I locked mys-- - Okay.

153
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,660
Dr. Park is not here,

154
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,700
and we're discussing something important.

155
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,910
Right. Sorry.

156
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,480
Kellan, your dad's in surgery.

157
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,770
It could be a couple hours.

158
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,440
Thanks.

159
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,090
Shaun.

160
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,060
That was a little harsh. We're talking about your love life.

161
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,300
Talking about my love life is important.

162
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,980
It helps clear my head so I can focus on the medicine.

163
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,360
Intracranial hypotension.

164
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,270
It is consistent with Alice's headaches

165
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,780
and dizziness getting worse when she's upright.

166
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,940
And a leak in spinal fluid can be triggered

167
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,300
by severe intracranial pressure during childbirth.

168
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,740
To confirm I'm right,

169
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,920
we need to insert a lumbar drain into Alice's spine,

170
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,290
infuse her with fluid, and see if her symptoms improve.

171
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,390
But if you're wrong, she'll have an excruciating headache,

172
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,420
massive brain pressure, temporary vision loss --

173
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,680
She'll give her consent.

174
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,040
It's a reasonable diagnosis,

175
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,870
and the patient's desperate for an answer.

176
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,160
Can you do the procedure alone?

177
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,830
Only one doctor is needed to insert a lumbar drain,

178
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,040
and I have a time-sensitive matter to take care of.

179
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,320
Sure.

180
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,440
You okay? You look okay.

181
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,580
I'm fine.

182
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,210
Your text said it was urgent, a--

183
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,770
My text said it was "Time sensitive."

184
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,860
I have to get back to work before my lunch break is over.

185
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,200
I was at work, too, Shaun.

186
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,230
I know we left things in a weird place,

187
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,650
but now is not a good time.

188
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,680
The pinto beans are next to the tomatoes.

189
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,600
That is not in alphabetical order.

190
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,130
There's more.

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,370
The toilet paper is in the wrong direction.

192
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,730
The way you like it.

193
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,110
You got angry when we were roommates

194
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,580
because I sometimes couldn't accept your way of doing things.

195
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,510
But I can learn to accept things

196
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,960
I'm not comfortable with.

197
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,770
This is not bothering me at all.

198
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,510
I can deal with your messiness and neediness...

199
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,340
and selfishness --

200
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,270
Stop.

201
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,730
Your way of proving

202
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,660
that you're flexible and attentive to my needs

203
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,110
is to pull me away from work -- with no notice --

204
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,480
make me drive all the way across town,

205
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,630
just so you can show me you un-alphabetized your beans?

206
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,500
Doesn't that seem a little...

207
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,430
inconsistent?

208
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,670
That is a good point.

209
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,730
I should have waited until evening,

210
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,430
when you are done with work.

211
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,890
We can discuss this later.

212
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,700
I have to get back to the hospital.

213
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,080
Resecting necrotic tissue around the annulus.

214
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,880
Dr. Reznick, trim down the patch from the pericardium.

215
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,210
The infection caused a fistula, and we need to remove it.

216
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,930
Repair the annular defect with a pericardial patch.

217
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,450
He's gonna have permanent heart damage.

218
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,550
The guy survives IV drugs, Hep C, hard time

219
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,900
and gets taken down by a cactus spike

220
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,640
on his road to redemption.

221
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,980
That's...ironic.

222
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,040
Predictable.

223
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,450
He ignored dangerous symptoms

224
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,780
because he wanted to be a tough guy for those kids.

225
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
He's trying to keep them from repeating his mistakes.

226
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,740
It's admirable.

227
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,410
Narcissistic waste of time.

228
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,020
You can't undo a lifetime of abandonment

229
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,660
with a couple weeks in the woods.

230
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,930
The kids are all still here, aren't they?

231
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,080
Finish the closure of the fistula tract

232
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,490
with pledgeted sutures.

233
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,620
Park.

234
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,360
I need you to come with me.

235
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,380
Now?

236
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,100
Go. We got this.

237
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,950
Security agreed to let us keep this between us.

238
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,350
No need to call the cops.

239
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,150
Everyone needs to chill.

240
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,900
We weren't cooking meth in the dumpster.

241
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,630
You have any idea

242
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,530
how many people die from vaping pot?

243
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,990
What were you thinking?

244
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,550
We'll give you two some space.

245
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,360
You. With me.

246
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,140
You have asthma, Kellan.

247
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,790
I know you're not this stupid.

248
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,580
Heart rate's tachy at 148. Systolic's in the 200s.

249
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,230
I removed the drain a half-hour ago.

250
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,970
I was wrong. My idea made things worse.

251
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,360
We need to do a lumbar puncture to relieve the built-up fluid.

252
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,500
But it didn't make her worse

253
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,930
the way it should have made her worse.

254
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,530
She should have a headache or upward brain herniation.

255
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,810
Heart rate should be low.

256
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,240
Something is causing her heart to beat too hard, too fast.

257
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,780
I missed something --

258
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,790
Shaun, you need to give her

259
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,530
a 10-milligram bolus of labetalol now,

260
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,960
or she is going to die.

261
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,610
I missed something.

262
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,290
Shaun!

263
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,510
Mommy?

264
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,440
Alice?

265
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,350
There was significant tissue damage from the infection,

266
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,120
but it should be manageable with medication

267
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,240
and some modifications to your diet.

268
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,510
So...no more Flamin' Hot Cheetos?

269
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,690
That's not a thing any self-respecting adult should eat.

270
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,470
You'll need long-term follow-up with a cardiologist,

271
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,280
beta-blockers,

272
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,470
ACE inhibitors --

273
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,260
What'd you do?

274
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,560
Mr. Reed was found vaping THC on hospital grounds.

275
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,470
I'm emancipated, so I'm basically an adult.

276
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,030
You're only emancipated

277
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,910
'cause your parents do even dumber stuff than you do.

278
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,890
Thanks for letting me know.

279
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,490
There'll be consequences for his behavior.

280
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,190
Starting with an apology.

281
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,040
And not some smartass one, either.

282
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,360
Uh, Mr. Keeler, your hand is swollen.

283
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,960
I need to take a look at your feet.

284
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,660
Less than a hundred milliliters.

285
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,790
What's wrong with his piss?

286
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,760
Max.

287
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,980
What's going on?

288
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,650
We're gonna need to run some additional tests.

289
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,530
We've done a lumbar puncture to remove the excess fluid

290
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,760
and bring your spinal pressure back to normal.

291
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,410
When will she be able to go home?

292
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,990
I'm not going home.

293
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,910
Honey, their test just about killed you.

294
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,740
In front of your daughter.

295
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,090
She wasn't supposed to be here.

296
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,830
That's because you told me you were visiting your sister.

297
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,210
Since when do we lie to each other, Alice?

298
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,890
You have to stop doing this to yourself.

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,020
They're only gonna confirm the same diagnosis

300
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,450
you've already been given.

301
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,880
You said you don't have a diagnosis.

302
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,280
They told her she has idiopathic dysautonomia

303
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,420
six months ago.

304
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,300
It was confirmed by two other doctors.

305
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,850
You left it out of your medical records?

306
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,710
"Idiopathic" Is just a doctor's fancy way

307
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,980
of saying that they don't know why I'm sick or how to fix it.

308
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,710
You haven't given the treatments a chance.

309
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,750
Because even on them,

310
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,320
I can barely sit up most of the time.

311
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,950
Ruby deserves a mother

312
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,550
who can teach her how to do a cartwheel...

313
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,970
...and scoop her up when she's having a nightmare.

314
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,730
She deserves a mother who's around.

315
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,600
Ruby...

316
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,690
...doesn't need to learn how to do a cartwheel.

317
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,690
She needs you to watch her, cheer her on.

318
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,540
And lay down next to her when she's scared.

319
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,840
And eat the cookies she bakes and pretend to be enjoying them.

320
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,500
You're a great mother.

321
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,380
And...

322
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,840
there's good in the life we have.

323
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,170
And you're missing it

324
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,920
by constantly searching for something better.

325
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,710
Something that may not exist.

326
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,350
Are you feeling overheated?

327
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,890
No.

328
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,670
Scared?

329
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,850
No, I'm feeling sad that my husband thinks there's no hope.

330
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,840
You are sweating.

331
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,850
Sweat is a response to fear, not sadness.

332
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,510
Your temperature is normal.

333
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,450
You may have an adrenal tumor.

334
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,990
- Is that good? - Yes.

335
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,720
Tumors can be removed.

336
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,950
I'm not mad.

337
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,030
I'm a little mad.

338
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,470
But I want to understand what's going on.

339
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,500
Dad, not now.

340
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,610
I mean, it's not like you to be this reckless

341
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,940
with your health, your future.

342
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,370
I can't --

343
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,360
Kel, are you having an asthma attack?

344
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,160
Where's your inhaler?

345
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,620
I don't -- It's --

346
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,110
It's not the asthma.

347
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,070
What is it?

348
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,730
Tell me what you're feeling.

349
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,890
My heart's... beating fast.

350
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,460
Do you feel dizzy?

351
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,440
Like the walls are closing in?

352
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,940
I think you're having a panic attack.

353
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,940
Take a deep breath.

354
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,880
1, 2, 3...

355
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,880
Now out.

356
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,830
Keep breathing.

357
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:39,710
Good.

358
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,590
Does this happen a lot?

359
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,080
I know vaping is stupid, but...

360
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,950
It helps this feeling go away.

361
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,800
Hey, give it back, asshat!

362
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,260
Victor, Max!

363
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,290
Cut it out.

364
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,250
Mr. Keeler.

365
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,220
We have some test results we need to discuss.

366
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,420
In private.

367
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,230
Whatever you have to say to him, you can say to us.

368
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,620
Oh, wish you could.

369
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,750
Would love your input.

370
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,160
But, clearly, you're far too busy watching...

371
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,080
pimple-popping videos.

372
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,330
Go away.

373
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,600
The damage to your heart

374
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,900
temporarily cut off blood flow to your kidneys.

375
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,000
They were already weak and couldn't handle the stress.

376
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,530
You've progressed to complete renal failure.

377
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:52,890
I'm sorry.

378
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,450
You'll need a transplant.

379
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,890
But dialysis can keep you going until a matching donor is found.

380
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,770
I'm guessing a guy with a bad heart

381
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,530
and damaged liver, history of hepatitis

382
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,280
isn't first up.

383
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,840
Your best bet is to find a living donor --

384
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,790
most likely, a family member.

385
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,130
I'm an addict...

386
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,920
who stole and lied like one and then went to prison.

387
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,400
My Christmas card list is pretty short.

388
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,950
We'll connect you with our transplant coordinator.

389
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,630
She'll help you reach out to family

390
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,750
and answer any questions they may have.

391
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,040
Should've taken those twerps sailing.

392
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,390
Her husband's not wrong, Shaun.

393
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,380
Sometimes, people need to accept

394
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,260
that things are as good as they're gonna get

395
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,570
and make peace with it.

396
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,950
Wanting more can only lead to disappointment and heartbreak.

397
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,710
What good does it do to give up if you're already heartbroken?

398
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,970
You were right. No tumor.

399
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,110
Well, you were also right.

400
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,800
The bright color.

401
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,870
It means there is an increase in the uptake

402
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,230
of radioactive material in the medullary space.

403
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,260
Which is enlarged and overproducing adrenaline,

404
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,940
so the gland itself is acting like a tumor.

405
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,600
We have a new diagnosis.

406
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,120
The quiet is a nice change of pace.

407
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,990
I told the boys to get some air,

408
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,810
try to avoid committing more criminal offenses on hospital grounds.

409
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,150
I know they can be annoying and loud

410
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,630
and constantly in the way,

411
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,250
but I can't make them leave.

412
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,600
Want me to give it a shot?

413
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,210
I'd like to see that, actually.

414
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,740
Nah, they just scared.

415
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,430
They think if they leave, then...

416
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,540
I'll be the latest in a long line of people

417
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,470
they didn't have a chance to say goodbye to.

418
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,530
Wes?

419
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,940
Code blue!

420
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,200
You do not have idiopathic dysautonomia.

421
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,230
You have a rare condition

422
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,010
called bilateral adrenal medullary hyperplasia.

423
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,060
Unfortunately, Alice,

424
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,980
there's only one cure for this condition,

425
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,200
and that's to remove your adrenal glands.

426
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,180
You would need to be on steroid replacement therapy

427
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,460
for the rest of your life.

428
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,360
And that comes with a whole new set of symptoms.

429
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,010
Fragile bones, high blood pressure,

430
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,150
G.I. issues, mood disorders,

431
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,200
increased chance of diabetes, serious infections.

432
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,780
I-I understand. I want to do it.

433
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,250
Medullary hyperplasia is not terminal or progressive.

434
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,040
You could have a normal life expectancy in your current condition.

435
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,150
My "current condition" is pathetic.

436
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,710
I'm having the surgery.

437
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,490
Alice.

438
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,910
This could kill you.

439
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,540
I love you.

440
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,370
I won't risk your life.

441
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,460
If you insist on going through with this...

442
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,220
...Ruby and I are leaving.

443
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,060
If you love her, you shouldn't leave her.

444
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,160
It's not her fault she's sick.

445
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,790
And she just wants to make things better.

446
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,040
- It isn't fair. - Shaun.

447
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,240
There is nothing worse than losing the person you love.

448
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,920
I'm sorry. This isn't Dr. Murphy's call.

449
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,280
Nor is it mine.

450
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,080
We'll give you two some time.

451
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,920
He's right.

452
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,020
I-I can't lose you and Ruby.

453
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,510
I won't do it. I won't -- I won't do the surgery.

454
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,560
Wes suffered major cardiac damage.

455
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,500
We can't solve one problem with this guy

456
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,960
before the next one hits.

457
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,710
He's stable now, but his heart can't handle

458
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,590
the fluid volume shifts of standard dialysis.

459
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,880
So the only thing keeping him alive will also kill him.

460
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
We could put him on low-flow dialysis.

461
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,260
Keep him in the ICU 'round the clock.

462
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,760
- That'll buy him a little time. - Very little.

463
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,720
Call UNOS. See if they'll move him up the list.

464
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,970
Where are we with family members?

465
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,850
Two of Wes' cousins agreed to be tested.

466
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,810
- We're waiting on the results. - Good.

467
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,210
Get on the phone with any other family you can find.

468
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,090
Tell them if their man doesn't get a kidney in the next couple days,

469
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,340
they should make arrangements to say their goodbyes.

470
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,150
New kicks won't help you outrun me.

471
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,570
They're recipes.

472
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,830
From Dash. Well, from Kayla.

473
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,660
Kayla by way of Dash.

474
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,000
It's complicated.

475
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,750
He asked me on a date.

476
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,740
What did you say?

477
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,810
Nothing. I stammered, and then I fled.

478
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,980
What did you want to say?

479
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,190
I don't know.

480
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,530
Shaun was right.

481
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,830
Coming home to an empty apartment really sucks.

482
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,290
I...

483
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,770
used men to make me feel better.

484
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,980
Most of them didn't mind.

485
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,750
But...

486
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,920
I...

487
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,140
don't trust myself not to hurt someone I care about.

488
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,230
Claire, it's not that complicated.

489
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,650
You lit up this morning when you saw him.

490
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,030
He seems to make you happy.

491
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,160
You deserve to be happy.

492
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,100
How you feeling?

493
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,350
I'm not high, if that's what you're asking.

494
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,850
It's not.

495
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,080
You know, earlier in the car,

496
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,650
I pushed too hard,

497
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,820
made you feel cornered.

498
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,610
I'm sorry.

499
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,410
You didn't know.

500
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,870
I, uh...

501
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,710
I talked to your mom.

502
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,850
Is she totally freaking out?

503
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,210
She's concerned.

504
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,690
And we talked about finding a therapist in Phoenix

505
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:52,720
who specializes in treating anxiety.

506
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,450
So you're pawning me off on a total stranger?

507
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,100
No. No. I --

508
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,750
I thought you'd be more comfortable

509
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,360
talking to someone who's not --

510
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,700
She said you've been pretty withdrawn lately.

511
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,640
I know things between your mom and I are a little --

512
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,710
Screwed up?

513
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,750
Unsettled.

514
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,380
Is that making you feel anxious?

515
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,710
No.

516
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,010
It's not you.

517
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,900
It's nothing. It's -- it's okay.

518
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,180
No, it's obviously not.

519
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,100
Some of this is on you.

520
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,910
You know, every time we talk,

521
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,580
you don't tell me anything about your life.

522
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,460
That's because you don't want to know anything.

523
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,860
That's not true!

524
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,070
You're busy saving patients a hundred hours a week.

525
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,340
You don't want to feel guilty about being a thousand miles away.

526
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,910
You just want to know that I'm okay.

527
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,370
So I say I'm okay.

528
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,010
That's annoying.

529
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,860
Can you do that someplace else?

530
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,370
I'm trying to find a better solution for my patient.

531
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,120
Your patient is being discharged.

532
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,870
I'm trying to get a kidney for a dying guy.

533
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,000
You're watching gross videos.

534
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,900
I'm waiting to hear back from UNOS.

535
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,330
Do you prefer being called or texted?

536
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,490
Neither.

537
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,890
Do you like surprises or do you find them irritating?

538
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,890
I find this irritating.

539
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,290
It's research.

540
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,890
Lea said we can't be together

541
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,600
because she is too needy and selfish

542
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,690
to deal with my issues.

543
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,440
You are the most selfish person I know,

544
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,260
so you are a good subject.

545
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,930
Lea's right. She is needy and selfish.

546
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,230
Find someone who loves you the way you are.

547
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:09,440
People always say that, but shouldn't we be with someone

548
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,940
who makes us a better version of ourselves?

549
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,120
Maybe.

550
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,830
But trying not to be autistic won't make you better.

551
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,490
I'm sorry you still don't feel good, Mommy.

552
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,220
Well, I'll feel better when I'm home.

553
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,830
Eating those delicious cookies that you make for me.

554
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,730
You don't have to go home.

555
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,500
I invented a better surgery.

556
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,000
Instead of removing both your adrenal glands,

557
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,650
we can just squeeze out the hyperplastic medullary part...

558
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,450
like popping a pimple.

559
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,800
You "invented" a surgery?

560
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,930
Dr. Murphy's come up with a surgical plan

561
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,460
that could curb overproduction of your hormones

562
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,060
while leaving you some adrenal function.

563
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,390
What are the chances it'll work?

564
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,350
Oh, we don't know.

565
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,230
Since it's never been done before,

566
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,600
it's difficult to predict the outcome,

567
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,340
but it is a safe and viable treatment option.

568
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,860
Is Wes dying?

569
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,330
We're doing everything we can to help him.

570
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,970
I snuck a look at his chart when no one was around.

571
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,390
You know that's a crime, right?

572
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,750
Only a misdemeanor.

573
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,670
You should talk to Wes.

574
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,890
We all got tested.

575
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,970
I'm a match.

576
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,180
I'm gonna give Wes my kidney.

577
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,990
We've discussed your offer at length, Max.

578
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:24,740
It's incredibly admirable and generous.

579
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,950
But you're 16.

580
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,540
Living donors have to be 18 years old.

581
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,170
I'm emancipated.

582
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,980
I can give consent for myself.

583
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,550
But it's still up to the hospital to decide if this is a good idea.

584
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:40,130
We don't feel this is in your best interest.

585
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,720
Max.

586
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,860
The surgery's much harder on the donor than the recipient.

587
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,530
You could have postoperative bleeding or infection.

588
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,990
And it's incredibly painful.

589
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,440
I've been through more crap than any of you.

590
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,960
I can handle it.

591
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,920
There are also long-term consequences --

592
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,880
high blood pressure, renal failure.

593
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,460
If something happens to your other kidney,

594
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,340
you don't have a spare.

595
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,510
I know how to subtract.

596
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,260
I'm cool with it.

597
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,420
And the recovery is long and hard.

598
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,430
You would need someone to help you get dressed and bathe

599
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,260
and make sure you take all your medications.

600
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,750
I've been taking care of myself just fine for a long time.

601
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,460
Actually, Max...

602
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,360
you've been in juvie and on drugs.

603
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,760
You're not taking care of yourself.

604
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,390
Okay, I get it.

605
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,190
I'm a screw-up.

606
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,600
But Wes isn't.

607
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,480
He's bailed me out of jail.

608
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,000
He's picked me up in the middle of the night

609
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,820
when I was too messed up to drive.

610
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,990
He's cleaned me up after fights.

611
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,120
He came with me to my sister's funeral.

612
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,080
If I manage to stay out of jail,

613
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,040
it's because of Wes.

614
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,840
If I'm a halfway decent father someday...

615
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,380
if I'm not a lost cause...

616
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,510
it's because Wes never gave up on me.

617
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,700
He shouldn't die

618
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,060
because I made dumbass decisions.

619
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,460
It's your surgery.

620
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,420
And we have the exact same amount of experience with this.

621
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,760
Free up the medulla along the inner cortical surface.

622
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,720
Careful not to penetrate the cortex.

623
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,830
Nothing's coming out.

624
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,630
Try using your fingers to pinch the gland.

625
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,990
Use a circular motion to coax it out.

626
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,280
I've popped my share of pimples.

627
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,100
That's cool.

628
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,940
One down, one to go.

629
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,920
Wes is like a father to Max.

630
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,010
If he were his actual father,

631
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,590
we wouldn't hesitate to let him do it.

632
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,870
I think we should.

633
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,540
Me, too.

634
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,250
The little punk got to me.

635
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,770
We've explained all the risks.

636
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,000
Max was unwavering.

637
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,220
I vote yes.

638
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:15,410
One admirable decision

639
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,850
doesn't wipe away a lifetime of bad ones.

640
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,230
It's three against one.

641
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,450
This isn't a democracy.

642
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,660
I'll tell the patient.

643
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,510
One of the boys get into trouble again?

644
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,390
No.

645
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,220
No, they've given you a reason to be proud.

646
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,520
They all got tested to see if they were a match.

647
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,850
Max is.

648
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,100
He wants to give you his kidney.

649
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,070
That little turd is full of surprises.

650
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,420
I can't approve the transplant, Wes.

651
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,420
I'm sorry.

652
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,180
Max is a good kid.

653
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,220
He's gonna make a good man one day, thanks to you.

654
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,500
But, for now, he still needs grown-ups to have his back.

655
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,750
The risks to his health --

656
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,520
It's okay.

657
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,530
It --

658
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,370
It's the right call.

659
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:06,330
It's my job to save those kids.

660
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,040
Not the other way around.

661
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,220
You're still on the UNOS list.

662
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,720
We'll keep reaching out to your family.

663
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,930
We're not giving up.

664
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:29,650
I need you to do one other thing for me.

665
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,340
Sorry to interrupt.

666
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,540
It's okay.

667
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,090
No one's probably listening anyway.

668
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,350
Your kidney's not a match.

669
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,230
They said I was.

670
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,570
Your blood and tissue type were good.

671
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,420
But the serum crossmatch showed

672
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,410
that Wes produces antibodies in reaction to your cells.

673
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,080
His body would reject your kidney.

674
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,290
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,170
Figures.

676
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,270
I can't do one stupid thing right.

677
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,630
That's not true.

678
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,300
You did everything you could.

679
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,470
Wes is so proud of you.

680
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,190
Any dizziness or nausea?

681
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,480
No. No headaches, either.

682
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,320
You need to try getting out of bed

683
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,360
to see if your symptoms return.

684
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,280
She ready for that?

685
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,060
No cartwheels yet, but hopefully.

686
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,740
How's it feel?

687
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Room's not spinning.

688
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,170
Mommy! You're all better!

689
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,560
Careful, sweet pea.

690
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,040
Mama's still recovering.

691
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,300
I'm okay.

692
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,030
Here's the Big Dipper.

693
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,200
If you extend a straight line through these two,

694
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,880
this bright star is Polaris.

695
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,830
All of our phones have compass apps.

696
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,740
Hey, just shut up and listen.

697
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:29,450
This crap's important.

698
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,670
Polaris is your true north.

699
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:38,190
You keep your eye on that, you're gonna find your way out

700
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,050
of whatever mess you've gotten into.

Shaun, I already said no.

717
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,840
Yes, because you think

718
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,800
there are problems that can't be fixed.

719
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,470
But I am very good at solving problems.

720
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,470

I can fix this. 

724
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:01,310
Yes. You have to give me a chance.

725
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:02,650
You need to let me try.

726
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,650
No. I don't need to do anything. You need to listen to me.

727
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,440
- No. No -- - This is only proving my point.
