7
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,640
My name was Oliver Queen.

8
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,050
For three years, I worked to save my city.

9
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,560
But to save my sister, I had to become someone else.

10
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,360
I had to become something else.

11
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,320
Previously, on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,360
Roy's alive. We faked his death.

13
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,490
He's starting a new life.

14
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,290
- John. - Oliver?

15
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,460
Bring Nyssa to the warehouse

16
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,870
at Fullerton and Halstead...

17
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,880
and I'll let your wife go.

18
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,270
There's no way I'm getting him back.

19
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,280
He's gone, Felicity.

20
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,500
There's only thing left of him now--us.

21
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,180
Do you recognize this?

22
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,910
The Alpha and Omega bioweapon.

23
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,220
You will unleash this on Starling City.

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,710
His fever is getting worse!

25
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,300
Maseo!

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,700
A pharmacy!

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,710
The Romans call it "Vastatio".

28
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,260
The systemic destruction of a land to insure its subjugation.

29
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,070
And what they found was

30
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,390
that immolation left a blank slate to build anew.

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,970
Until you have destroyed your home

32
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,340
and severed all ties from your old life,

33
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,990
can you begin anew.

34
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,490
I did not foresee the day that Maseo Yamashiro

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,280
appeared at my door.

36
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,540
You had the courage to demand an audience of me.

37
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,810
And those who do usually offer money and treasure

38
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,380
in exchange for my favor.

39
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,580
But you gave me the Alpha and Omega.

40
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,260
The plane is en route.

41
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:55,490
It will be ready tomorrow, as you've commanded.

42
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,450
You will marry my daughter,

43
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,980
and you will ascend to Ra's Al Ghul,

44
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,980
and then you will fly to Starling City

45
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,330
carrying death itself.

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,480
I hate when they run!

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,710
Well, at least you're getting your cardio workout in.

48
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,780
I still have 40 minutes on an elliptical

49
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,110
in my immediate future.

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,440
You supposed to be undercover or something?

51
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,410
I sniffed you three blocks back.

52
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,150
You led me right to your gang.

53
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,820
Smart plan.

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,720
Thanks.

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,180
No, I meant smart plan...

56
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,180
because it was mine.

57
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,930
John, I think he gives up!

58
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,700
John!

59
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,070
John!

60
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,840
Thanks for coming in through the back.

61
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,530
With Sara and Lyla gone, the last thing I need

62
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,540
are the neighbors talking.

63
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,630
About some strange woman dressed in all black leather,

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,460
- yeah. - You're out of ice.

65
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,300
How can you be out of ice?

66
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,330
- Here. - Thanks.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,320
Ok, so the night's young,

68
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,620
and there's a meth dealer working a corner on Fulton.

69
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,800
- Sounds good. - Actually, it doesn't.

70
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,050
You were completely unhinged out there tonight, Dig.

71
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,580
You're in denial about how angry you are.

72
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,220
No, Felicity, I'm not in denial.

73
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,720
But I am angry!

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,080
Oliver.

75
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,130
He was my best friend.

76
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,160
And he kidnapped...

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,180
my wife.

78
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,220
And you think that justifies hospitalizing people?

79
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,400
No, Felicity, it doesn't, you're right.

80
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,760
It won't happen again.

81
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,410
I'm not saying that life doesn't suck right now,

82
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,730
but you can't go around the city

83
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,460
taking it out on every criminal you see.

84
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,540
How can you, out of all people, be so sanguine

85
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,710
after what happened last week?

86
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,300
Because I know that that wasn't Oliver.

87
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,320
- Now who's in denial? - It wasn't!

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,570
Our Oliver, my Oliver,

89
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,090
died the day he joined the League.

90
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,710
- This is someone else! - You truly believe that?

91
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,510
I have to.

92
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,470
Don't try to talk me out of going.

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,430
Mr. Harper went through a lot of trouble to fake his death.

94
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,580
You know he can never come back here.

95
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,020
Yeah, well, maybe I'm just going to go there.

96
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,430
- Permanently? - Look, I don't know.

97
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,810
Honestly, I--I don't know anything anymore.

98
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,910
I barely know who I am.

99
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,700
Thea, it's understandable.

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,970
You've been through something

101
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,350
very few people have ever experienced.

102
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,310
Of course you feel--

103
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,760
Is that what you think this is all about?

104
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,980
Almost dying? Because I'd rather have died

105
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,710
than had my brother sacrifice his life for mine.

106
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,770
And don't think for a second

107
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,230
that I forgot the whole reason

108
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,960
Ra's Al Ghul was brought into our lives

109
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,370
is because of you.

110
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,030
You're no longer in danger from the League.

111
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,680
Maybe getting away from Starling City for a while

112
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,470
is--is what's best for you.

113
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,360
You approve?

114
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,690
Is that supposed to worry me?

115
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,820
'Cause it actually kind of does.

116
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,940
Look, the only thing I know right now...

117
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,170
is that I need to go be with Roy.

118
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,720
My daughter.

119
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,860
- I am not hungry. - Ah, yes.

120
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,540
Many a bride has skipped a meal or two before their wedding day.

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
I would rather die than wed this pretender.

122
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,400
Well, you speak as though they are the only two options

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,720
before you, my daughter.

124
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,360
Daughter.

125
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,030
And to think, I once wore that title with pride.

126
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,460
Perhaps "Mother" will suit you better.

127
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,120
After your betrothal to Al Sah-Him,

128
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,820
you will extend my lineage by having a child of your own.

129
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,470
If you think I will bear his child...

130
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,120
Yes! I do.

131
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,850
And you will have no more say in it than your mother was given.

132
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,440
You're quiet.

133
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,580
I'm prepared for my ascension to Ra's.

134
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,550
But I'm still...

135
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,110
coming to grips with marriage.

136
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,530
Perhaps a walk to clear my head.

137
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,890
I will send a guard to accompany you.

138
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,690
If I can't protect myself,

139
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,120
I don't deserve to inherit your mantle.

140
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,850
You're late.

141
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,140
Sorry.

142
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,090
Nanda Parbat's not exactly the easiest place to infiltrate.

143
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,140
Don't joke!

144
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,090
Things are worse than we thought.

145
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,640
- Tomorrow? - Ra's plans to transport

146
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,170
the virus to Starling on a plane.

147
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,260
That is oddly modern for the League.

148
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,560
Do you think Ra's suspects you?

149
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,860
He has no reason to.

150
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,260
I warned you it would be difficult.

151
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,580
I just thought that I'd...

152
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,720
Ahem--we'd have more time,

153
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,060
when you explained to me that my ascension to Ra's

154
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,030
would include the destruction of Starling.

155
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,090
I anticipated you wouldn't be Ra's for months.

156
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,600
More than enough time to dismantle the League from the inside.

157
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,440
Malcolm, we need help.

158
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,300
From all accounts, you were...

159
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,370
too good at convincing your friends

160
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,220
that you'd allied yourself with Ra's,

161
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,240
and I don't think I carry much credibility with them.

162
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,200
I know someone who they'll trust.

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,200
You've been gone a while.

164
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,560
There was concern.

165
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,270
I've just been here thinking.

166
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,060
We need to find Ibuprofen!

167
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,680
You know that can't help him now.

168
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,410
Why isn't the inoculant working on him?!

169
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,090
He's young. His immune system probably isn't strong enough.

170
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,800
Akio!

171
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,850
Swallow.

172
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,460
Okaasan...boku kowaiyo.

173
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,880
Shinitaku naiyo...

177
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,240
General Shrieve...

178
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,840
Maseo. I want to kill Shrieve, too,

179
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,110
But you need to focus on helping Akio!

180
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,040
Shrieve's men made a vaccine.

181
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,310
Maybe they also made a cure.

182
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:46,330
No, Maseo, they didn't make a cure!

183
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,630
I know it's unlikely,

184
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,210
but I have to try.

185
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,550
Ok.

186
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,840
I'll help you.

187
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,530
Hi, I'm looking for Jason.

188
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,080
Oh, yeah? Well, lucky him.

189
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,050
Yo, Jason. Got a visitor.

190
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,670
Jason?

191
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,360
That's right.

192
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,110
I have a '67 Mustang that needs a little work on it.

193
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,820
Somebody said you were the guy to see.

194
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,630
You came to the right place.

195
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,710
I can't believe you're still alive.

196
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,040
Look, I wanted to tell you,

197
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,080
but if you knew, you'd tell Oliver.

198
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,260
And then Oliver would have...

199
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,200
- Would have broken you out of prison. - Yeah.

200
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,350
And probably kicked your ass.

201
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,240
And I would have helped him.

202
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,330
I had to do it.

203
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,080
For Oliver.

204
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,890
Do you think there's maybe some other place

205
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,160
we can go talk?

206
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,210
There's my place.

207
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,780
That's such a good answer.

209
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,790
You got it to fly. What more do you want?

210
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,790
Well, true art is never finished,

211
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,990
it's only abandoned.

212
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,730
Plus, I had this little idea I just couldn't kick.

213
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,830
You ok?

214
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,960
You have this little cloud

215
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,290
that keeps following you around.

216
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,160
Yeah.

217
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,210
Well, something happened while you were away,

218
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,030
and...I'm just handling it.

219
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:34,490
Is it, uh, Oliver-related?

220
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,520
It's Oliver-related.

221
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,960
If you want to talk about it...

222
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,770
Maybe we shouldn't cross that line.

223
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,430
It's a long story, anyway.

224
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,150
Well, if you change your mind, I have time.

225
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,960
And, hey...

226
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,510
you're my friend.

227
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,900
I'm always going to be there for you.

228
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,610
It's non-negotiable.

229
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,370
Thanks, Ray.

230
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,990
So, while I'm waiting to do something for you,

231
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,490
there's a little something that you can do for me.

232
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,810
Sign...here and here.

233
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:05,750
Ok.

234
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,120
Right.

235
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,210
What's this for?

236
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,020
Just a little corporate stuff,

237
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,220
miss Vice President.

239
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,400
Everything ok?

240
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,870
Probably not.

242
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,480
You've been quiet.

243
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,850
I have a lot on my mind.

244
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,830
I meant about the virus.

245
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,160
The Alpha Omega.

246
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,140
When did you take it?

247
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,780
From the truck.

248
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,900
Before we blew it up.

249
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,340
So before...

250
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,960
Even before Akio died.

251
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,810
I wanted revenge on Shrieve

252
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,030
for the pain he caused.

253
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:54,310
But instead, you used it to trade your way into the League.

254
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,890
I am not strong.

255
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,540
Not enough for myself,

256
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,580
and certainly not enough for Tatsu.

257
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,500
If you could go back to her, would you?

258
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,230
That is immaterial.

259
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,900
Maseo yamashiro is no more.

260
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,280
He doesn't have to be.

261
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,870
When I'm Ra's, I can release you from your oath.

262
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,730
I can set you free.

263
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,730
The League is not my prison.

264
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,660
From my prison...

265
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,740
there is no escape.

266
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,790
So now Malcolm Merlyn can summon us.

267
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
I really don't like the idea that he can summon us.

268
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,570
Any idea what this is about?

269
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,690
No, but Merlyn assures me that he'll be waving the white flag.

270
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,390
I'm sorry. I forgot the flag.

271
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,980
That's too bad. I would have told you where you can put it.

272
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,930
What is this about, Malcolm?

273
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,950
Well, this isn't going to be easy for all of you to believe...

274
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,930
Only because you're a sociopath and a liar.

275
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,340
Be that as it may, this will be much quicker

276
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,640
for all of us if we can fast forward through the cynicism

277
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,350
and reach the conclusion that I am telling you the truth.

278
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,300
About what?

279
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,760
Oliver.

280
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,270
His allegiance with the League is a charade.

281
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,610
Why would you even begin to play with our emotions like that?

282
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,940
This plan was born the moment Oliver realized

283
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,070
that he had to capitulate to Ra's to save Thea.

284
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,420
And instead of sharing this plan with us,

285
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,690
he trusted you?

286
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,010
The man who had my sister murdered.

287
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,470
Well, I am better practiced in the art of deception.

288
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,210
And no offense, none of you are

289
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,140
- particularly good actors. - I'm out.

290
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,970
You've seen for yourselves

291
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,160
how dangerous Ra's and the League are.

292
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,550
The circle of trust had to remain as small as possible.

293
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,060
Until now? What changed?

294
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,570
Forget it, Felicity.

295
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,130
There's nothing he can say that we can believe.

296
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,170
Mr. Diggle's right.

297
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,250
Which is why I brought along

298
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,810
a friend of Oliver's.

299
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,060
My name is Tatsu Yamashiro.

300
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,210
And your city is in great danger.

301
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,480
You expect us to believe her?

302
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:04,290
We never even met her.

303
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,170
- We never met her, right? - No.

304
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,320
Apart from my brief time helping Oliver

305
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,220
recover from the wounds Ra's Al Ghul inflicted on him,

306
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,350
my life has been one of...isolation.

307
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,380
Ok, Merlyn, this is your big plan?

308
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,840
A woman that we've never met or even heard of?

309
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,850
Oliver doesn't like to speak about the past.

310
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,200
Apparently, he's not so forthcoming about the present, either.

311
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,360
My son was killed by the virus.

312
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,840
Ra's intends to use on your city.

313
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,370
Are you--you're Akio's mother?

314
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,000
Oliver was with me when it happened.

315
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,530
He knows that the danger you all face is very real.

316
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,300
Ok, you know what, how many times are we going

317
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,850
to believe him after everything that he's done?

318
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,650
I am not privy to your history with Malcolm.

319
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,950
This request comes from Oliver.

320
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,640
We're not sure that's any better at the moment.

321
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Look, I am not playing a game here.

322
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,020
My daughter lives in this city, remember?

323
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,500
This is everything I have on the bioweapon.

324
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,950
I've arranged passage for all of us to go to Nanda Parbat.

325
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,030
If you're coming...

326
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,450
Be at Ferris Air before sunrise.

327
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,020
Charming.

328
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,200
It's a sublet. I won't be here for much longer.

329
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,090
What about the auto shop?

330
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,490
It's...temporary.

331
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,730
Sure, they don't ask a lot of questions,

332
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,250
but it's inevitable someone puts two and two together.

333
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,940
How about your other night job?

334
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,220
I figured I'd just leave the crime fighting to the cops.

335
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,500
I kind of just want to be normal.

336
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,340
Yeah? And how's that going for you?

337
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,280
I am so bored.

338
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,540
Yeah, well, that's why

339
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,850
I brought you this.

340
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,930
Malcolm stole it out of impound.

341
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,890
Don't worry--I made him promise nobody would get killed.

342
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,960
I never thought I'd see this thing again.

343
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,660
I figured since everybody thinks that

344
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,180
Roy Harper is the Arrow,

345
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,300
they don't have to know that he's Arsenal, too, right?

346
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,130
So that's why you came here?

347
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,250
Just to give me this?

348
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,180
Well...yes, this.

349
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,450
And...

350
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,390
How could we not know about this?

351
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,410
How could anyone not know about a terrorist attack in Hong Kong?

352
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,240
Because Beijing had us believing that these deaths were caused

353
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,750
by a local chemical spill.

354
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,180
You don't really believe Merlyn?

355
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,690
Well, looking at this, we can't afford not to believe Merlyn.

356
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,090
He is a mass murderer who has lied to us so many times

357
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,070
it should be a drinking game.

358
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,170
And I have never even heard of this Tatsu person.

359
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,630
Felicity, I don't know if you're right

360
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,420
that Oliver's gone forever or not.

361
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,440
The truth is, for me, it doesn't matter.

362
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,280
If there's even a possibility of this kind of danger in my city,

363
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,460
I'm reporting for duty.

364
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,430
- Me, too. - I don't believe them.

365
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,980
And even if I did, I can't go back there.

366
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,410
Not after what they did to Oliver.

367
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,640
Relax, my child.

368
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,480
Another order I cannot follow.

369
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,500
You speak to me as though I'm a monster.

370
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,010
I'm your father, Nyssa.

371
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:30,450
Then why do you ask me to marry someone I do not love?

372
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,420
When I was in a desert

373
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,390
tending to some affairs,

374
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,850
I crossed paths with a woman.

375
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,880
She was breathtaking

376
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,010
in her visage and fortitude.

377
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,600
Her name was Ameena Raatko.

378
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,440
I had taken other lovers before,

379
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,520
but she was different.

380
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,730
She had a wit

381
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,780
and a fire about her that

382
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,990
I found myself I could not live without.

383
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,110
So she became my concubine

384
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,880
and the mother of my child.

385
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,860
This was my gift to her in honor of you.

386
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,450
A gift that she gave me.

387
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,000
And so I kept it in the hopes that one day,

388
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,560
you would wear it on your wedding day.

389
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,930
You expect me to marry Al Sah-Him because of some trinket?

390
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,440
I expect you to marry Al Sah-Him

391
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,150
because it is my will.

392
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,660
You defy that, and I will

393
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,550
see you suffer the pain of a thousand deaths.

394
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,280
I am sorry to intrude.

395
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,420
Mr. Merlyn said that I would find you here.

396
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,570
That might be the only thing he's ever said that isn't a lie.

397
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,770
I did not come here to convince you

398
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,150
of the threat to your home.

399
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,320
There's nothing I can say that you will believe,

400
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,500
more than what you have seen.

401
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,250
Then why are you here?

402
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,260
To speak with you about Oliver.

403
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,400
During his recuperation,

404
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,160
Oliver spoke of you.

405
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,350
Of how his last thought before the fall

406
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,910
was of you.

407
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,540
You love him... still.

408
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,530
Oliver belongs to Ra's now.

409
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,540
If you believe that, you must fight for him.

410
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,430
There is no "him" left.

411
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,900
I thought as you do once.

412
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,240
My husband, Maseo,

413
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,320
was consumed by the League's darkness,

414
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,090
I was so convinced that he was lost to me

415
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,530
that I didn't even try to reach him.

416
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,390
Don't make my mistake...

417
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,810
Felicity.

418
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,270
Are you sure Shrieve will be here?

419
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,970
Do you know of any other rogue U.S. Army bases in the area?

420
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,470
Shrieve will have reinforced the station

421
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,350
since the last time we were here.

422
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,930
Two there.

423
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,260
Waller took you from Lian Yu

424
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,140
because she saw something in you.

425
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,860
My son needs that from you.

426
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,790
The killer inside.

427
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,420
Sir, this is a restricted area.

428
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,470
Is that a Masamune Blade?

429
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,600
A katana.

430
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,000
Passed on for centuries within my family.

431
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,100
The first son of each generation.

432
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,710
You are not a son, Tatsu.

433
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,070
No, I am not.

434
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,530
Let's get this over with.

435
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,970
The plane's ready; it should be big enough for all of us.

436
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,310
Including her.

437
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,400
Thought you weren't coming.

438
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,590
I changed my mind.

439
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,590
But if you betray us, I'll make sure the whole world knows

440
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,540
that you are alive, and where they can find you.

441
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,780
So this is Nanda Parbat.

442
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,180
Next time, we should really look into getting some horses.

443
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,450
You think they rent horses here?

444
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,760
There won't be a next time.

445
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,080
There it is.

446
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,390
The plane Ra's intends to use

447
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,710
to spread the Alpha Omega over Starling.

448
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,950
I need to be within 50 yards to breech the plane's

449
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,510
internal mainframe and navigation software,

450
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,200
but then I should be able to remote ground the thing.

451
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,700
- Quiet. - I don't see anything.

452
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,220
There'll be more.

453
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,460
Get to the plane. We'll cover you. Go!

454
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,890
Close enough.

455
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,780
Surrender now, and you might live.

456
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,810
Maseo.

457
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,300
Maseo is a memory.

458
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,150
Our child was gone,

459
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,510
and you left me when I needed you most.

460
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,940
But you can still come back to me.

461
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,980
It's not too late.

462
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:29,610
Yes, it is.

463
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,660
You know I wouldn't have done the same thing for you.

464
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,570
I know.

465
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,700
Your husband is long dead.

466
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,510
If Sarab must die as well,

467
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,140
then so be it.

468
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,640
Oh, frack!

469
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,020
More frack!

470
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,850
Oh. That makes more sense.

471
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,740
Can you bring it down from the sky?

472
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,610
They destroyed my gear, but I had some insurance come along.

473
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,900
What kind of insurance?

474
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,910
The Atomic kind.

475
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,600
Ray!

476
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,110
Ray!

477
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,180
You should see the other guy.

478
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,490
Tell Akio...

479
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,740
I love him.

480
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,880
You tell him for both of us.

481
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,080
Thank you...

482
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,170
for releasing me...

483
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,380
from my prison.

488
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,090
Enough!

489
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,770
You have failed.

490
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:44,060
Any further attempt to undermine our cause would be futile.

491
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,550
Uh, you see that burning plane over there?

492
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,980
We destroyed your city threatening bioweapon.

493
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,070
No.

494
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,460
You merely think you did.

495
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,370
Surrender!

496
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,810
Or die.

497
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,150
Oliver. Oliver, what's going on?

498
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,810
If any of you speak, we're all going to die.

499
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,850
- What...? - I need you to trust me.

500
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,940
Chinese have a saying.

501
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:32,710
Stir the grass, and you stifle the snake.

502
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,470
My ruse with the plane was meant to reveal

503
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:37,510
any traitors among me.

504
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,820
How did you know of the virus?

505
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,800
Of the plane?

506
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,100
Maseo told me,

507
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,700
And I told them.

508
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,570
So a dead man told you.

509
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,740
How convenient.

510
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,160
He said only three men knew about your plan.

511
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,980
You, him, and Oliver.

512
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,540
Oliver Queen is dead.

513
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,920
I am Al Sah-him.

514
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,160
This would not be the first time

515
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,340
that Sarab has betrayed me

516
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,770
to Maseo Yamashiro's weaknesses.

517
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,500
And though your timing was a function of my gambit,

518
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,090
it was nevertheless fortuitous.

519
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,180
You see, by tradition, Ra's would contemplate mercy

520
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,350
upon his enemies on the eve of a wedding.

521
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,720
You are getting married?

522
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,890
I guess there really is a kettle for every pot.

523
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,660
The wedding is mine.

524
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,430
I am betrothed to Nyssa Al Ghul.

525
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,530
Take them below.

526
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,010
So are you going to tell me now?

527
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,260
Tell you what?

528
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,820
What you're really doing here?

529
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,410
What, seeing you is not good enough?

530
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,630
What's going on?

531
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,140
Something happened.

532
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,420
I was hurt.

533
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,830
And...

534
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,300
to save me, Ollie...

535
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,810
had to accept Ra's offer to join the league.

536
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,000
Oh, my God.

537
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,020
Thea...

538
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,530
I tried to stop him.

539
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,560
I--I couldn't, and...

540
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,800
now he's become someone else.

541
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,190
Everything just slips away when I'm with you.

542
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,680
I understand that.

543
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,570
But?

544
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,240
When bad things happen, your go-to move is to bolt.

545
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,450
To get out of Starling.

546
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,670
I don't think this is something

547
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,080
you can run away from.

548
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,440
I'm not running away.

549
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,060
Running to you.

550
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,300
Do you not want me to?

551
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,100
The only thing that I want

552
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,490
is what's best for you.

553
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,560
You always have.

554
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,040
Come here.

555
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
I can't believe he's going to marry her.

556
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:38,260
You should worry more about getting out of here alive.

557
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,580
Is that even a remote possibility?

558
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,290
Didn't think so.

559
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,800
We aren't going to die here.

560
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,500
Oliver would never let that happen.

561
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,810
He let this happen.

563
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,090
Wareeth Al Ghul commands your presence.

564
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,270
Leave us.

565
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,260
Is everyone ok?

566
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,480
Like you give a damn!

567
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
- Didn't Malcolm speak to you? - He did.

568
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,880
So was a part of your plan to leave my daughter alone

569
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,890
when you kidnapped my wife?

570
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,140
I had to do something

571
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,500
to prove my loyalty to Ra's.

572
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,790
So taking Lyla? That was your idea, Oliver?

573
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,190
In front of our daughter?!

574
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,540
Yes. You met Tatsu.

575
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,640
What does that have to do with anything?

576
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,870
Tatsu told me...

577
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,490
that in order to beat Ra's,

578
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,260
I would have to sacrifice

579
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,430
all of the things in my life that I hold most precious.

580
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,880
And your friendship is on that list.

581
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,640
Oliver, you didn't just... lose my friendship.

582
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,970
You lost my trust.

583
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,780
You lost my respect.

584
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,890
What?!

585
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,140
Ra's demands that we return

586
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,640
this man to his friends.

587
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,480
Give us the cure.

588
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,380
You boys make quite the entrance.

589
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,580
The cure! Now!

590
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,940
The Chinese own enough of our national debt

591
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,730
to decimate our economy,

592
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,640
And all without firing a shot.

593
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,720
Or, they could destroy us

594
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,950
with the largest army in human history.

595
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,900
Enough!

596
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,650
My son needs your cure.

597
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,960
What makes you think--

598
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,900
The next one goes in your head.

599
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,990
You see that safe over there?

600
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,190
The passcode is 4587.

601
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,350
He'll have to deliver the cure subcutaneously,

602
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,870
In the exact ratio I give you.

603
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,910
You may want to write this down.

604
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,500
You don't need to tell us.

605
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,310
You're coming with us.

606
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,050
This is so beautiful...

607
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,630
And yet so dangerous.

608
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,010
Much like its former owner.

609
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,640
Sarab's former love,

610
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,700
who's now my prisoner,

611
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:41,590
along with Al Sah-him's former friends.

612
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,190
You see, their treachery was anticipated.

613
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,610
Yours, however, Al Sa-Her, is disappointing.

614
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,210
Because I expected more loyalty

615
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,600
from a man whose daughter I saved.

616
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,810
The last time I appeared before you in chains,

617
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,450
I offered my fealty,

618
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,110
and I am here to offer it again.

619
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,360
You had nothing to offer then,

620
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,070
and you have nothing to offer now.

621
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,550
I have the name of the person

622
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,980
who betrayed you to Al Sah-him's friends.

623
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,320
It wasn't Maseo Yamashiro.

624
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,890
It was Oliver Queen.

625
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,450
He's been lying to you all along.

626
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,630
What's this?

627
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,990
I'm sorry, Oliver.

628
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,100
My name is Al Sah-him.

629
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,610
Not according to Mr. Merlyn here.

630
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,920
You see, he claims that you've been deceiving me the entire time.

631
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,980
I have killed for you.

632
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,250
I have severed all ties to my past.

633
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,670
I have hurt people who were friends to Oliver Queen,

634
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,820
and if you hadn't have stopped me,

635
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,920
I would have murdered your daughter at your command.

636
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,430
But what if this is all just part of your own elaborate ruse?

637
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:54,200
Then I will have nothing and no one to go home to.

638
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,680
Oliver Queen is dead,

639
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,720
and the Arrow is gone.

640
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,860
We shall see.

641
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,320
Roy?

642
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,250
Excuse me, I'm, uh, looking for--

643
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,300
Jason's friend, yeah, I remember.

644
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,550
He said you probably would be stopping by.

645
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,570
Oh. Can I talk to him?

646
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,470
I don't know where he is. He came in an hour ago to quit.

647
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,970
He, uh, said to give you this.

648
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,120
Dear Thea, I wasn't supposed to make it this far.

649
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,470
I was supposed to end up in jail or dead by now.

650
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,990
But then I met you, and you made me want to be the man

651
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,680
I saw through your eyes.

652
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,420
And now all I want to do is give that back;

653
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,140
help you be the person you can be without Oliver,

654
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,900
without your father, and without me.

655
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,960
Living on the run from the police

656
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,600
isn't the life you deserve, Thea.

657
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,010
It's not what Oliver gave up his life for you to have.

658
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,520
Whatever happens with me,

659
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,480
I'll always love you.

660
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,620
P.S.--thanks for the suit,

661
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,890
but I always thought red was more your color, anyway.

662
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,560
So what did Oliver say to you?

663
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,540
Nothing worth hearing.

664
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,220
You were right about Oliver.

665
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,000
I should have listened to you.

666
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,300
I told you about Oliver. You were supposed to--

667
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,810
I was supposed to do what, Mr. Merlyn?

668
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,290
Grant you mercy?

669
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,630
I am.

670
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,350
Because this death will be a lot shorter

671
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,500
than the one I had planned for you.

672
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,170
You--

673
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,560
Oliver, if what Malcolm said is true,

674
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,930
if you're going to do anything, now is the time!

675
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,240
Al Sah-him has said that the swordswoman is inoculated,

676
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,880
so you can take her to another chamber.

677
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,440
No! Oliver!

678
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,890
Oliver, we believed in you!

679
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,410
Seal the room.

680
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,520
You're not listening. Oliver!

681
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,140
For the love of god!

682
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,220
No, Oliver!

683
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,330
What the hell are you doing?!

684
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:33,720
Come on, you got to get us out of here!

685
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
We trusted you.

686
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,990
You asked us to trust you and we trusted you!

687
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,170
Don't do this! Oliver!

688
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,050
Tatsu.

689
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,360
There's a cure, and he knows how to administer it.

690
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,010
A little help.

691
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,440
Maseo...

692
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,700
He's not breathing.

693
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,420
The cure, he needs it now!

697
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,510
Akio！

698
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,510
Please wake up.

699
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,950
Please wake up!

700
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,290
He was dead the moment he was exposed.

701
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,140
But you said...

702
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,810
That there is no cure.

703
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,680
Then what the hell is that?!

704
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,000
Insulin.

705
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,920
I'm diabetic.

706
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,590
I want to thank you for bringing me here.

707
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,130
It would have taken us weeks to track you all down.

708
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,380
And I do so hate loose ends.

709
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,870
You are Wareeth Al Ghul,

710
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,370
Heir to the demon.

711
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,670
Before the night is over,

712
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,000
You will be Ibn Al Ghul.

713
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,270
Son of the demon.

714
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,090
There is no vow more sacred,

715
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,210
nor covenant more holy

716
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,870
than the one between man and woman.

717
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,320
With this ceremony,

718
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,490
your souls are bound together,

719
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,900
forever joined.

720
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,130
You will never be free.

721
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,530
You will always be held captive

722
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,200
By your love for each other.

723
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,210
Continue.

724
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm sorry, Felicity, for everything.

725
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,540
You don't have to be sorry for anything, John.

726
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,480
And for the shared life...

727
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,020
I'm glad to have known you.

728
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,640
We offer blessings.

730
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,770
The union is sealed.
