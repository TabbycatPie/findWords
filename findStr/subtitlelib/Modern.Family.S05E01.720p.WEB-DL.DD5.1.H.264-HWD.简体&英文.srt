00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,580
2013年6月26日

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,690
拿这么多干嘛  说了只能带一个箱子
What's all this? I said one suitcase.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,810
我需要各种备选衣服  杰
I need choices, Jay.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,890
在哥伦比亚没必要那么讲究吧
Colombia's not one of your more formal nations.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,120
有钱人坐在躺椅上都行
The guy on their money is sitting in a lawn chair.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,780
真不敢相信我的小宝贝要离开我了
Ay. I cannot believe that my little baby's leaving me.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,940
我忘了关楼下的玻璃门了
You know, I left the glass doors open downstairs.

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,720
所以现在你真正的宝贝可能正在离开你呢
So right now, your actual baby may be leaving you.

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,930
睡袍只能带一件
One robe.

10
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,280
我猜第二天早上大家都要
I guess we know what everyone

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,110
议论我连续穿同一件睡袍了
will be talking about my second morning there.

12
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,650
曼尼要去歌洛莉亚老家待一个月
Manny is visiting Gloria's family for about a month, I hope.

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,110
我得趁歌洛莉亚情绪崩溃
I just gotta get him on a plane before

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,280
改变主意前  把他送上飞机
Gloria has a meltdown and changes her mind.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,200
因为如果不把他送去哥伦比亚
'Cause if he doesn't go to Colombia,

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,530
整个哥伦比亚就要找上门了
Colombia comes to me.

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,290
先前的惨痛教训历历在目
It happended before.

18
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,750
我的天啊
Oh, my god.

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,020
-天呐  -怎么啦
- Oh, my god! - What?!

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,660
是米奇尔  我们赢了
Oh! It's mitchell. We won.

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,500
太好了  赢什么了
Ay, that's great! What we won?

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,320
太棒了  我们等了那么久
It's fantastic. We've waited so long.

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,300
赢什么啦
What did we won?!

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,130
最高法院裁决判定同性婚姻合法
The supreme court ruling. Gay marriage is legal.

25
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,830
恭喜恭喜
Ay! Congratulations!

26
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,650
谢了  歌洛莉亚
Thanks, Gloria.

27
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,050
能让小卡接电话吗
Can I talk to Cam?

28
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,960
好  等下
Uh, yes. Hold on.

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,760
谢谢  谢谢  是的  是米奇尔
Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it's Mitchell.

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,320
喂  说
Hi. Hey.

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,570
我得挂了  你能相信这终于成真了吗
I gotta go. But can you believe this finally happened?

32
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,510
是啊  太棒了  晚上要庆祝一下
I know. It's amazing. We'll celebrate tonight.

33
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,190
-我爱你  -庆祝什么
- I love you. - Celebrate what?

34
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,850
杰  坐稳了
Oh. Well, Jay, hold on to your hat.

35
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,220
从今天开始  在加州
But as of today in California,

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,360
法律认可同性婚姻啦
it's legal for a man to marry another man!

37
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,720
他吐了
Ew. He threw up.

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
他只是需要点时间来接受  亲爱的
He just needs some time to get used to the idea, honey.

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,750
太棒了  小卡
It's so great, Cam.

40
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,480
是啊  真替你们开心
Yeah, I'm happy for you guys.

41
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,890
歌洛莉亚  曼尼需要出生证明
Gloria, Manny needs his birth certificate

42
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,260
才能重新入境
to re-enter the country.

43
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,470
知道在哪吗
Any idea where it is?

44
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,120
我不知道
I don't know.

45
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,370
对哦  他今天就走了  你一定很不舍
Oh, that's right. He leaves today. You must be a wreck.

46
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,470
她没事的  她很坚强
She's not a wreck. She's a rock.

47
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,220
找过了  没在保险箱里
Now, I looked, and it's not in the safe.

48
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,850
莉莉上周第一次在朋友家过夜
This one had her first sleepover last week.

49
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,910
我鼓励自己要坚强  挺过了一晚
I just had to tough my way through it.

50
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,960
他半夜去把我接回家了
He picked me up in the dark.

51
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,460
哪里都找不到出生证明  杰
I can't find that birth certificate anywhere, Jay.

52
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,440
也许这是个预兆
Maybe it's a sign and --

53
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,960
是个预兆提醒我们要重新讨论
It's a sign we need a refresher meeting

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,160
保险箱里应该放什么
on what goes in the safe.

55
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,220
先给你透露一点  不能放鞋
Here's a preview -- no shoes.

56
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,190
我上网查了
Look, I looked online,

57
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,640
我们可以去法院要个复印件
and we can get a copy if we go to the courthouse.

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,920
就这么办  上车
That's what we're gonna do. In the car.

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,660
我们一个小时后就回来
We'll be back in an hour.

60
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,400
小卡  恭喜  同性婚姻万岁
Hey, Cam. Congratulations. Go, gay marriage.

61
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,400
他又吐了
He did it again.

62
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,870
是吗
Ay, si?

63
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,170

跟我讲讲  小卡
So tell me, Cam.

78
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,390
你们男男之间是怎么"攻做"的
How does it work when it is between two men?

79
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,710
我觉得在莉莉面前
Well, I don't really feel comfortable

80
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,180
谈论这种事不太好吧
talking about that... in front of Lily.

81
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,630
我知道你们怎么做的啦
I know how that works.

82
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,790
有次我租错碟了
I rented the wrong movie once.

83
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,100
你看过《"大根"游戏》吗
Did you see "Glen, Garry, Glenn, and Ross"?

84
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,100
恶搞阿尔・帕西诺主演的《大亨游戏》

85
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,320
没有
Uh, no.

86
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,630
-你先去一边玩  -我的问题是
- Why don't you go play? - What I mean is,

87
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,520
谁该向谁求婚呢
who proposes to who?

88
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,130
我不知道  我们谈过如果合法了要怎样
I don't know. We've talked about it, if it ever became legal.

89
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,920
现在成真了  你今天要求婚吗
Okay, and now it is. So are you going to do it today?

90
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,780
才刚刚宣布
Well, it just happened.

91
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,430
我还没有...
I haven't really had...

92
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,320
你一定要今天求婚
Oh, you have to do it today.

93
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,600
每对爱人都应该有段美好的求婚故事
Every couple deserve a beautiful proposal story.

94
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,230
我一直很羡慕我爸妈的求婚故事
Well, I have always adored my mom and dad's story.

95
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,270
我爸用犁在我妈窗外的雪地里
He plowed "Will you marry me?" into a snowy field

96
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,780
犁出了"你愿意嫁给我吗"几个字
right outside of her window.

97
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,710
他们结婚25周年时
And then he tried to re-create it

98
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,180
他想再重现那个场景
for their 25th wedding anniversary.

99
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,630
但当时没下雪  他把字烧在玉米地里了
But there was no snow, so he burned it into a cornfield.

100
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,820
大错特错
Bad idea.

101
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,220
但我妈确实因此又得到一枚戒指
You know, but mama did get a second ring out of it

102
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,450
用紧急事务管理署发的救援金买的
with the F.E.M.A. money.

103
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,460
我多希望自己也有浪漫的故事
Ay, I wish I also had a romantic story.

104
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,160
那天  我们在饭前看电视
One day, we were watching tv before dinner,

105
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,130
杰说  "曼尼  把东西给我"
and Jay says, "Manny, hand me that thing."

106
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,650
曼尼就把戒指递过去了
And Manny gives him the ring.

107
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,370
当然  我很开心
I mean, I was very happy, of course,

108
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,170
但我总想经历更好的故事
but it is not the best story.

109
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,150
至少哈维尔还是骑着海豚求婚的
At least Javier was on top of a dolphin.

110
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,430
战士们总谈论将一切抛之脑后的那一刻
Soldiers talk about that moment when they shut off,

111
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,730
在战争终于结束的时候
when the war finally wins.

112
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,070
-蹲下  -闭嘴吧你
- Get down! - Shut up!

113
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,460
我看不到电视了
I can't see the tv!

114
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,700
把风扇打开
Turn the fan on!

115
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,150
别鬼叫了  我脑袋都要炸了
Oh, stop yelling! My head's going to explode!

116
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,290
对我来说  那一刻就是
For me, that moment is

117
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,840
暑假开始的第四天
four days into summer vacation.

118
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,690
亲爱的  怎么了
Hey, honey. What's up?

119
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,990
你还能想起当夏天只有萤火虫
Do you remember when summer meant fireflies

120
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,270
热裤以及冰淇淋的时候吗
and cutoff shorts and ice-cream trucks?

121
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,060
我有其中之一
Well, one out of three.

122
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,830
会有时间的  他们都要出门的  对吧
We'll get our time. They're all going away at some point, right?

123
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,420
是啊  海莉要去海滨
Yeah, Haley's got her beach trip,

124
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,400
艾丽克斯要参加国际仁人家园活动
and Alex is doing Habitat for Humanity,

125
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,490
卢克要去露营
and Luke has camp.

126
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,350
没记错的话
If I remember,

127
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,100
我们有六个小时清静独处的时间
I think we have six hours totally kid-free on...

128
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,190
就在14号那天
oh, the 14th.

129
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,520
如果我们更改艾丽克斯的航班
Hey, if we moved Alex's flight,

130
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,040
我们就能有10或12个小时了
we could have, like, 10 or 12 hours.

131
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,930
有点野心  热裤男
Dream bigger, hot pants.

132
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,510
靠边
Step aside.

133
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,020
有时我不知道自己是喜欢怕克莱尔的感觉
Sometimes I don't know if I love how much I fear Claire,

134
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,160
还是怕自己太爱她
or fear how much I love her.

135
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,870
把艾丽克斯从22号调到8号
22nd to the 8th for Alex,

136
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,480
把卢克调到14号
Luke to the 14th,

137
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,320
把海莉调到这天
Haley gets a day there.

138
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,100
-好嘞  -就是这样  真是大智慧
- Come on. - That's it, beautiful mind.

139
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,950
化疯狂为美好
Harness that crazy into something positive.

140
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,790
如果能让艾丽克斯把仁人家园活动的地点
Shh! If I can get Alex to move her Habitat for Humanity

141
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,400
从俄克拉荷马州调到萨克拉门托
from Oklahoma to Sacramento

142
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,310
再让卢克更改露营的日期
and Luke to move his camp session,

143
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,120
他们就会和海莉的出游时间重合
they will both overlap with Haley's vacation,

144
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,480
那样我们就有7天自由时间了
and I just bought us seven kid-free days.

145
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,420
-点"时"成金啊  -是的
- Witchcraft! - Yes.

146
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,120
我崇拜死自己了  歌洛莉亚
I've outdone myself, Gloria.

147
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,650
我订了我们第一次约会的餐厅
I booked the restaurant from our first date,

148
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,000
依然是那张能俯瞰大海的桌子
the same table overlooking the ocean,

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,010
我会在日落时分开口
and I'll do it at sunset,

150
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,200
我最近发现日落时的光线最衬我了
which I've recently discovered is my ideal lighting.

151
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,540
真浪漫啊
That's so romantic.

152
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,630
是啊  很浪漫吧
I know! Isn't it?

153
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,360
是米奇尔打来的
Oh, okay. Oh, that's Mitchell.

154
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,890
我要挂了
Gotta go.

155
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,120
别让他听出来你有多兴奋
Oh, don't let him hear the excitement in your voice.

156
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,590
你说得对  说得对
You're right. You're right.

157
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,930
-说话  -我在三街的咖啡店
- What? - I'm at that coffee shop on 3rd,

158
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,220
我忘记带钱包了
and I forgot my wallet.

159
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,090
能来救我吗
Can you come bail me out?

160
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,020
怎么这么巧啊
Ugh. Isn't this convenient?

161
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,960
其实真的很巧  我离那里只有两条街
It actually was. I was only two blocks away.

162
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,780
但我到了以后  发现是他为了求婚
But when I got there, I realized it was all a ploy

163
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,390
耍的小伎俩
so he could propose.

164
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,750
但他这么做真贴心
But it was so sweet,

165
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,120
我决定放弃自己的计划让他先下手了
I just decided to ditch my plans and let him do it.

166
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,390
米奇尔  太抱歉了
Mitchell, I'm so sorry,

167
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,540
但405公路上发生了严重追尾事件
But there is a massive pileup on the 405,

168
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,610
我得去接莉莉了
and, well, I have to go pick up Lily.

169
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,920
也许你可以给克莱尔打电话求助
And maybe you could just call Claire or something?

170
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,950
小卡  小卡  我大概还剩50美分
Cam, Cam, I got, like, 50 cents to my name.

171
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,880
你决定点什么茶了吗
Have you decided on a tea?

172
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,060
价格都一样吗
Do they all cost the same?

173
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,290
好吧
Yeah.

174
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,670
好长的队啊
Look at that line.

175
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,060
大家可能都来领同性结婚证书了
Probably everybody getting their gay marriage license.

176
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,050
那好像就叫结婚证书吧
I think it's just called a marriage license.

177
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,840
那个  我也说不清
Yeah, I don't know.

178
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,780
也许我们该回家  不去了
Maybe we should go home and forget about it.

179
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,400
什么
What?

180
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,130
我最近在阅读一些热带疾病的资料
I've been reading up on some of those tropical diseases --

181
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,390
疟疾  黄热病  狂犬病
Malaria, yellow fever, rabies.

182
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,540
我属于高危人群  杰
I'm high risk, Jay.

183
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,570
我喜欢与人握手
I'm a big hand shaker.

184
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,200
没事的  你注射过所有疫苗了
You're fine. You've had all your shots.

185
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,990
而且你喷的帕科香水会吓跑蚊子的
And that Paco Rabanne will scare away any mosquitoes.

186
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,520
杰  我害怕
Jay, I'm scared.

187
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,880
我不确定自己想不想去了
I'm not sure I want to go through with it.

188
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,190
我们开了这么远的路来拿证明
We didn't drive all the way down here for that piece of paper

189
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,350
可不是为了让你临阵脱逃的
for you to get cold feet at the last second.

190
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,570
到底发生了什么事
And what happened, anyway?

191
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,470
你几个月来一直很盼望这一天
You've been looking forward to this day for months.

192
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,180
我知道  但也许我们该等到明年
I know. But maybe we should wait until next year.

193
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,710
我现在还太小了
I'm still kind of young to be doing this.

194
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,570
不能等
We're not waiting.

195
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,230
我已经付钱了  你妈妈也签字了
I already paid for you, and your mother signed off.

196
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
就这么定了
This is happening.

197
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,550
好日子  是吧
Great day, huh?

198
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,020
-我来了  -谢天谢地
- Hello! - Oh, thank god.

199
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,450
我喝了好多杯茶
I've had so many cups of tea,

200
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,810
他们给了我专属的厕所钥匙
they gave me my own one of these.

201
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,480
给你
Ohh. Here you go.

202
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,480
恭喜你们终于可以合法结婚了
So congratulations on the whole marriage thing.

203
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,190
-太棒了  对吧  -是啊
- How amazing is that, right? - Yeah.

204
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,160
你们很快就要举办一场同性恋婚礼了吗
We gonna hear some big gay wedding bells soon?

205
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,480
叫婚礼就可以了
Ah, well, just wedding bells.

206
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,610
当然啦  我们总是讨论这事
Yeah. Yeah, of course. We've always talked about it.

207
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,130
但你知道的
But, you know,

208
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,250
只是要找到合适的时机
it's just -- just a matter of finding the right timing.

209
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,970
还有其它的一些因素
And then there -- there's a couple of other factors --

210
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,730
税务影响和财产规划
the tax implications and estate planning.

211
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,010
打住  我都要晕了
Oh, stop. I'm swooning.

212
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,890
我只是从实际考虑
I'm just being practical.

213
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,090
你也是这样的人啊
You're the same way.

214
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,770
你叫菲尔退掉订婚戒指
You -- you told Phil to take back your engagement ring

215
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,210
买台洗衣烘干机
and buy you a washer/dryer.

216
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,210
别扯到我身上来  拜托
Well, don't put this back on me. Come on.

217
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,150
小卡最不满意你哪一点
What is Cam's biggest complaint about you?

218
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,580
你不浪漫
You're not romantic.

219
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,830
现在是你翻身的大好时机
This is your opportunity.

220
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,930
米奇尔  你今晚回家
Mitchell, you should go home tonight

221
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,190
隆重地向他求婚  给他一个惊喜
and surprise him with a big, splashy proposal.

222
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,860
如果我向他求婚  他会很开心的
He would really like it if I proposed to him.

223
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,350
我想下班后我可以去买张卡片
I guess I could stop after work and pick up a card.

224
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,620
-然后  -天啊  你简直无可救药
- And... - Oh, my god. You're hopeless.

225
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,360
-我知道  -米奇尔
- I know. - Mitchell, okay.

226
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,090
-你要这样做  -天啊
- This is what you do. - Oh, boy.

227
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,200
但是该由你自己想主意
It really should be your own idea, though.

228
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,360
不  拜托  我需要帮助  求你了
No! Come on, come on. I need help. Please?

229
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,500
好吧
Fine. Okay.

230
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:47,840
今晚  你给他做他最爱吃的菜肴
Tonight, you cook him his favorite meal.

231
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,630
开一瓶最好的红酒
You open the best bottle of wine.

232
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,580
当你们坐着品味美酒时
And just as the two of you are sitting down to enjoy it,

233
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,870
你和他分手
you break up with him.

234
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:55,800
什么  为什么
What? Why?

235
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,640
因为在他伤心欲绝的时候
Because then, as he is at his lowest,

236
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,600
你突然求婚
you pop the question.

237
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,620
他会从痛苦不堪变成欢天喜地
He goes from agony to ecstasy!

238
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,220
多浪漫
It's so romantic.

239
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,490
你在开玩笑  对吧
You're kidding, right?

240
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,390
你想要更传统的吗  好吧
More traditional? Okay.

241
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,730
好  你深情凝视他的双眼
All right. You look into his eyes...

242
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,310
说  "我去看了医生
And you say, "I saw a doctor.

243
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,240
他发现了一小块黑色的东西"
He found a small dark mass."

244
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,310
你什么毛病啊
What are you?

245
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,940
当他开始哭泣时
And then just as he begins to cry,

246
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,670
你拿出一个装着戒指的黑盒子
you pull out a black box with a ring in it.

247
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,030
这就是那个黑色的东西
There's your small dark mass!

248
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,200
这主意太天才了
It's genius!

249
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
你真是个灾难
Y-you're a disaster.

250
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,830
你也可以走灾难路线
You could go the disaster route, too.

251
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,980
你听过我是怎么告诉菲尔我怀上卢克的吗
Did you ever hear how I told Phil we were gonna have Luke?

252
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,980
我说"每天都有成千上万的儿童死去"
I said, "Thousands of children die every day..."

253
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,200
爸
Dad?

254
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,260
抱歉  我太为你自豪而吵到你了吗
I'm sorry. Was I being proud of you too loud?

255
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:38,940
你在干什么
What are you doing?

256
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,650
做仁人家园志愿者  去帮助别人
Going off to habitat, helping all those people.

257
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,920
乖女儿  我简直无语凝噎了
Honey, I'm speechless.

258
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,680
谢谢  我只是觉得那...
Thanks. I just thought it was --

259
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,840
但你确定要去俄克拉荷马州吗
But are we sure about Oklahoma?

260
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,920
在萨克拉门托就有许多需要帮助的人
There's so many needy people right up in Sacramento.

261
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,320
从家开车就能到那里
And it's driving distance.

262
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,100
我已经确认了我的工作细节
I already signed up for my work detail,

263
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,780
也开始和同住一个帐篷的人邮件联系了
and I've been e-mailing with my tentmate.

264
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,400
是啊  你说得对
Yeah. No, you're right.

265
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,710
我想只是...
I guess it's just...

266
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,390
不
No.

267
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,740
算了
Never mind.

268
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,230
怎么了
What is it?

269
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,210
没事  这太愚蠢了
No, it's stupid.

270
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,350
只是我以前从没
I've just never been so far away

271
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,800
离我的小女儿这么远
from my baby girl before.

272
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,640
现在别哭啊  别哭
Not now, waterworks. Not now.

273
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,640
老爸
Oh, daddy.

274
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,610
你还好吗  爸
You okay, dad?

275
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,660
你好啊  孩子  我很好
Oh, hey, buddy. Never been better.

276
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,730
你真是体贴
You're so thoughtful.

277
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,790
你14号去露营后我会想念你的好的
I'm gonna miss that when you go off to camp on the 14th.

278
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,590
来打威浮高尔夫吗
Little Wiffle golf?

279
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,040
等等  我14号没法去露营
Wait. I cant't go to camp on the 14th.

280
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,490
我得和卡莉一起去
I have to go when Carly's going.

281
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,970
卡莉是谁
Who's Carly?

282
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,740
她是我喜欢的女孩  她就在客厅呢
She's this girl I like, and she's here right now.

283
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,850
那就更应该改变露营的日期了
Well, all the more reason to change camp sessions.

284
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,400
小别胜新婚嘛  这是不会错的
Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It's foolproof.

285
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,300
这次会错  你别想了
Not this fool. Forget it.

286
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,330
你还会遇见很多新女孩的
What about all the new girls you're gonna meet?

287
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,590
你才14岁
You're only 14.

288
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,190
现在就想吊死在一棵树上了吗
Do you really want to be tied down?

289
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,090
是的
Yes!

290
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,790
卢克  瞧  我会了  好
Oh, Luke, watch. I-I got it. Okay.

291
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,870
好
Okay.

292
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,850
真棒
Nice!

293
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,820
您好  邓菲先生
Oh, hi, Mr. Dunphy.

294
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,340
抱歉我们搬开了家具
Sorry we moved the furniture around.

295
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,230
我给卢克表演了
I was showing Luke

296
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,880
我在翻筋斗地区赛上做的动作
the flip I did at tumbling sectionals.

297
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,880
不好  是我妈妈来了
Oh, no. That's my mom.

298
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,150
但我可以把我带来的这部老电影留给你们
But I can leave you guys this old movie I brought over.

299
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,550
电影名是《辣身舞》
It's called "Dirty Dancing."

300
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,160
千万别放开她
Never let her go.

301
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,430
你好  卡莉妈妈  我是菲尔・邓菲
Hey, Carly's mom. Phil Dunphy.

302
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,500
你女儿的铁杆粉
Big fan of your daughter.

303
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,400
-谢谢你  -放开我
- Thank you. - Get off me!

304
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,270
听我说  卢克得改变露营的日期
So, yeah, heads up. Luke's got to change his camp session.

305
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,270
-你们能不能也改一改  -不行
- You guys may want to do the same. - No.

306
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,740
我丈夫和我这周都在算计日程
My husband and I have been working the white board all week,

307
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,900
好不容易能离开这些熊孩子三天
and we just bought three days away from that.

308
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,520
-又不是我干的  -你也打过去
- It wasn't even me! - Bank it!

309
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,180
卡莉
Carly!

310
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,040
曼尼  记住  你下了飞机
Okay, Manny, remember, as soon as you land,

311
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,290
就留神点玛拉莉亚[疟疾]
watch out for Malaria.

312
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,960
为什么  我打过疫苗了
Why? I got a shot for that.

313
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,000
我们能快点吗
Can we hurry this up?

314
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,180
不  我说的是你表姐玛拉莉亚
No, I'm talking about your cousin Malaria.

315
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,250
她去接你  但她可能带露贝拉一起去
She's coming to pick you up, but she might have Rubella.

316
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,420
-什么  -那是她女儿的名字
- What? - That's her daughter.

317
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,470
但在车上离她远点儿
But make room in the car

318
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,640
因为她可能有白喉
because she could have diphtheria.

319
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,450
谁是白喉
Who's diphtheria?

320
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,400
曼尼  白喉是一种病
Ay, Manny, diphtheria is a disease.

321
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,610
所以我要你在车上离她远点儿
That's why I want you to be apart from her in the car.

322
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,490
好了  走吧  歌洛莉亚  该告别了
Okay, let's go. Gloria, better say goodbye here.

323
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,910
他得抓紧去过安检了
He's got to hurry to get through security.

324
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,600
-又没有排长队  -马上就要排了
- But there's no line. - For now.

325
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,640
一队老年人旅游团刚到
A senior tour bus just pulled up.

326
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,380
你知道他们会让警报响多少回吗
You know how much private wanding that is?

327
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,130
他们身上一半的骨头都是金属的
Half their skeletons are metal.

328
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,340
曼尼  一降落就打给我哦
Ay, Manny, please. Call me as soon as you land.

329
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,700
-我会想你的  -走吧走吧
- I'll miss you. - And we're walking.

330
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,860
我爱你
I love you!

331
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,770
-慢着  -不  快上去
- Wait. - No. Up!

332
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,030
我忘了把我写的卡片给妈妈了
I forgot to give mom this card I wrote.

333
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,380
别别别  我帮你给她
Uh, no, no, no. I'll handle it.

334
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,320
一路平安  伙计  一路平安
Safe trip, buddy. Safe trip.

335
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,920
我们走啦
We're out of here.

336
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,100
别  我要目送他上楼
No, let's wait until he gets to the top.

337
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,940
保重  我的宝贝
Adios, mi amor!

338
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,380
谁想吃冰淇淋
Who wants ice cream? Huh?

339
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,940
他要是不回来了怎么办
What if he never comes back?

340
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,890
宝贝  哪有人离开家会不回来啊
Oh, honey, no one ever leaves home and doesn't come back.

341
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,990
我就是啊
I did.

342
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,960
乖女儿
Hey, honey.

343
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,460
我一直在考虑你去萨克拉门托的决定
I've been mulling over your Sacramento decision.

344
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,270
实际上那不是我的决...
It wasn't exactly my --

345
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,070
当然  我希望宝贝女儿离家近点儿
Of course I want my baby girl close,

346
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,880
但我得习惯你离家在外
but I got to get used to you leaving.

347
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,920
因为你上大学  而且肯定是名牌大学
Because college -- and knowing you, a great college --

348
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,120
已经指日可待了
is right around the corner.

349
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,210
我没说错吧
Am I right?

350
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,190
参加国际仁人家园会给你的大学申请加分
Now, habitat will look good on an application,

351
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,430
但萨克拉门托这地方真的对你有帮助吗
but does Sacramento really move the needle?

352
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,480
我在考虑另一个地方
I have another place in mind.

353
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,940
给你点提示  地名以"萨尔"开头
Little hint -- it starts with an "El."

354
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,170
萨尔瓦多吗  你开玩笑吧
El Salvador? Are you serious?

355
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,810
那地方政局不稳定
They have an unstable government

356
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,380
还是地震高发区
and -- and earthquakes.

357
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,630
看这有船  好像还有山呢
Boats. Looks like there's a h-hill.

358
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,920
我只是想说  你如果这个关头不逼自己
I'm just saying, you don't push yourself at this stage,

359
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,690
就只能上二流大学了
you wind up at a second-tier college.

360
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,520
很快你就会失去你的抱负
Soon you've lost all your ambition.

361
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,070
你会一辈子碌碌无为
You're just drifting through life,

362
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,580
指望有人给你个"家庭主妇"文凭
hoping someone offers you an "M-r-s" Degree.

363
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,090
那是你想要的生活吗
Is that who you want to be?

364
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,960
我的公主  第二顿早餐吗
Hey, princess. Second breakfast?

365
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,860
有意思
Fun.

366
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,600
马上要去海滩了是吧
So, big beach trip coming up, huh?

367
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,360
是的
Yeah.

368
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,120
没什么比七月底更好的了
Can't get better than late July,

369
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,350
-除了八月初  -省省吧  老爸
- unless it's early Aug... - Save it, dad.

370
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,060
我知道你和妈妈想摆脱我们独占房子
I know you and mom want the house to yourselves.

371
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,580
不是的
Nope.

372
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,720
就差我还没搞定了  对吧
I'm the last piece of the puzzle, right?

373
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,950
开个价吧
What's it worth to you?

374
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,030
好吧
Fine.

375
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,650
我给你付油钱和两顿饭行不
How about I pay for gas and two dinners?

376
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,400
不够  汽油费
Mnh-mnh. Gas,

377
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,830
每顿饭  日用品  两套新泳装
All dinners, groceries, two new bathing suits,

378
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,360
-冲浪板  还有...  -你疯了吗
- a boogie board, one of those... - Are you crazy?

379
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,430
-不  我还没说完呢  -你完了
- No. I'm also not done. - Yes, you are done.

380
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,240
知道为什么吗
You know why?

381
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,330
知道还有个结果是什么吗
You know another way this shakes out?

382
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,120
就是不让你去
You don't go.

383
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,830
没错  你要是太过分  你爹我不干了
That's right. Overplay your hand, I pull the plug,

384
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,940
你就失去了最后一次和朋友逍遥的机会
you blow your last chance for a good time with your friends.

385
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,380
大家会说你这人真没劲
Word gets out that you're not cool.

386
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,490
然后开学了
Then school starts.

387
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,320
你只好一整年死读书
You end up with your nose in a book all year.

388
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,500
交不到朋友  钓不到帅哥
No friends, no dates,

389
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,760
从来不打扮
not caring how you look.

390
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,620
那是你想要的生活吗
Is that who you want to be?

391
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,130
原来米奇尔真的是忘带钱包
Turns out Mitchell really had forgotten his wallet,

392
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,500
所以他根本没想到求婚的事
so proposing wasn't even on his radar.

393
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,400
我的计划无懈可击
My plan was bulletproof.

394
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,930
他会像创始人日上
He was gonna be as blindsided

395
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,870
最肥的猪一样被蒙在鼓里
as the fattest hog on Founder's Day,

396
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,670
而我呢
And I was...

397
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,720
真为我自己自豪
Pretty darn proud of myself.

398
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,050
我有个理想的求婚计划
I had the ideal proposal.

399
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,740
小卡曾经告诉我  他想要的就是
Cam once told me that all he wanted

400
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,890
一个能和他一起坐在摇椅上慢慢变老的人
was someone to sit in a rocking chair and grow old with.

401
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,330
所以我们吃晚饭时
So while we're at dinner,

402
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,090
克莱尔会去准备两把摇椅
Claire is setting up two rocking chairs

403
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,660
放在壁炉旁  再配上一瓶香槟
next to the fireplace, with a bottle of champagne.

404
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,990
他一定会...
Ohh. He is going to...

405
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,160
像四人扔猪游戏里的
Squeal like a Berkshire white

406
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,460
伯克郡猪一样尖叫不止
in a four-man pig toss.

407
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,600
天啊  我太想念创始人日了
Gosh durn it, I miss Founder's Day.

408
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,230
来这里吃简餐也太铺张了吧
This is a little bit fancy for just a quick bite.

409
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,600
没准都没有位子呢
Well, who knows if they can even get us in?

410
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,570
我问问看
Let me check.

411
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,500
塔克订的位
Reservation for Tucker.

412
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,130
东西都布置好了吗
Is everything set up with the table?

413
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,090
有位
Yeah.

414
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,920
那是我们第一次约会的餐厅
The restaurant where we had our first date,

415
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,620
还有小卡最爱的日落霞光
the sunset lighting that Cam loves...

416
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,420
他这是要求婚的节奏啊
He was going to propose.

417
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,450
我太感动了
I-I-I was so touched,

418
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,520
但同时  他也在摧毁我唯一的
but at the same time, he was ruining the one chance I had

419
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,800
展现浪漫情怀的机会
for romantic redemption.

420
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,300
小卡  我觉得很恶心
Oh, I'm feeling really queasy, Cam.

421
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,080
没事没事  我们坐下你就好了
No, no, no. You'll be okay once we sit down.

422
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,590
我想我得回家  对不起
I think I need to go home. Sorry.

423
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,990
不好意思  对不起
Oh! S-- excuse me. Sorry.

424
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,020
没事没事  我给你要点姜汁和饼干
No, no, no. We'll get you some ginger ale, some crackers.

425
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,350
不行  我得直奔厕所了
Mnh-mnh. I'm -- I got to run to the restroom.

426
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,550
你去取车吧
You -- you grab the car.

427
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,840
你吐完就好受了
Well, you'll feel better after you throw up.

428
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,570
计划有变  我们会提早回来
Okay, new plan. We're coming back early.

429
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,450
都准备好了吗
Is everything set up?

430
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,300
你说要两小时才回来的  我们还没出发
You said two hours. We haven't even left yet.

431
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,180
-那赶紧啊  -拖延一下
- Well, hurry! - Just stall.

432
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,670
就跟他说  海莉大出血了
Tell him that... Haley had a hemorrhage,

433
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,330
而只有你和她血型一致
and you're her blood type,

434
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,730
-所以你  -我才不要  你个食尸鬼
- so you... - I'm not doing that, you ghoul.

435
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,510
快去家里准备
Just get back to the house and --

436
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,340
-歌洛莉亚  -小卡  怎样啦
- Gloria. - Cam, how did it go?

437
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,620
-他有没有  -没成功
- Did he... - It didn't happen.

438
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,780
得实施后备方案了
I have to go with the backup plan.

439
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,100
幸好我有个后备的求婚方案
Fortunately, I had an alternate proposal scenario

440
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,670
以备不时之需
in case there was a problem.

441
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,300
杰和歌洛莉亚在帮忙看孩子
Jay and Gloria were babysitting,

442
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,650
于是我让他们重现
so I asked them to re-create

443
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,100
我们搬进我们的第一间公寓
the picnic under the stars we had

444
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,130
那晚在星空下共进野餐的情景
the night we moved in to our first apartment.

445
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,150
米奇尔肯定一看到就会...
Mitchell would take one look and...

446
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,500
像获了托尼奖一样喜极而泣
Sob like a Tony winner.

447
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,680
我找到了野餐篮
I got the picnic basket.

448
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,550
但你知道什么东西很难找吗
But you know what is going to be hard to find?

449
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,990
我对这整件闹剧的兴趣吗
My interest in this whole damn thing?

450
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,240
不  是蓝白色的桌布
No, the blue-and-white tablecloth.

451
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,740
找到了  在特殊场合用品柜里
Here it is. It was in the occasions closet.

452
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,550
他们把工具放在枕头套里
They keep their tools in a pillowcase,

453
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,600
却用整个柜子来放特殊场合用品吗
but they have an occasions closet?

454
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,760
你们怎么在这里
What are you guys doing here?

455
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,870
小卡要向米奇求婚
Oh. Cam is going to propose to Mitch,

456
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,890
我们在帮他布场
so we're here to help him set it up.

457
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,390
太巧了
That is coconuts!

458
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:21,000
米奇尔也叫我们来做一样的事
Mitchell asked us to do the same thing for him.

459
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,420
这样一来我真想留下
Well, that just makes me want to stay

460
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,840
看看结果会怎样
and see how this whole thing works out.

461
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,700
可以啊  我们布好场  然后躲起来
Oh, we can. Let's set it up and then we'll hide somewhere.

462
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,160
没错  躲进特殊场合用品柜里
Ay, yes, in the occasion closet.

463
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,950
不行  我们就照吩咐办  然后离开
No. We do what they asked and leave.

464
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,360
我们那辈人从没有过这种烦恼
We never had these problems.

465
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,010
这就是允许男人和男人结婚的下场
This is what happens when they let men marry men.

466
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,890
那肯定不是巧合
That cannot be a coincidence.

467
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,370
不好意思  我绕了路
Sorry about the detour.

468
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,710
我担心405公路上会塞车
I was just worried about the pileup on the 405.

469
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,880
慢慢开  坐车反而让我舒服些了
Oh, take your time. The drive's actually soothing me.

470
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,240
我的天
Oh! Oh, my gosh!

471
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
搞什么  怎么回事
Oh! What -- what was that?

472
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,440
我想是爆胎了  没事的
Oh. I think it's a blown tire. It's okay.

473
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,330
还有备胎  有工具吗
Well, I know there's a spare. Do -- do we have the tools?

474
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,850
-有的  在后备箱的枕头套里  -好
- Yeah, yeah. They're in the pillowcase in the trunk. - Right.

475
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,390
你为什么要这样不耐烦
Why do you have to be so grouchy?

476
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,540
我们在为他们创造美好的故事
We're giving them a beautiful story.

477
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,440
每个人都值得拥有一个美好回忆
Everybody deserves one.

478
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,940
我是个白痴
I'm an idiot.

479
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,270
你不是白痴  你不像别人那样浪漫
Oh, you're not an idiot. You're not as romantic as some --

480
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,220
这些东西背面就有双面胶
These things peel off on the back,

481
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,510
而我还一直在用胶水粘
and I've been gluing 'em.

482
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,590
我费个什么劲  你根本不在乎这些感觉
Why do I even bother? You don't care about this stuff.

483
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,940
你这是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

484
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,380
就像你向我求婚的时候
Yeah, like when you proposed to me.

485
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,250
你说"曼尼  把那个东西给我"
"Hey, Manny, hand me that thing."

486
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,220
那就是我的故事
That's my whole story.

487
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,730
慢着  那不是我的错
Hang on. That wasn't my fault.

488
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,090
我本来安排好了
I had something big planned.

489
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,640
你叫他把戒指给你
You asked him for the ring.

490
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,110
我指的是遥控器  他自己偷跑了
I was asking for the remote. He jumped the gun.

491
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,590
他本该在当天晚些时候
He was supposed to give me the ring

492
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,440
在餐厅里把戒指递给我的
later that night at the restaurant.

493
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,660
服务员会来问我们要不要咖啡
The waiter was gonna come by and offer coffee.

494
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,790
我会说"不用了  谢谢  喝了睡不着
I was gonna say, "No, thank you. It'll keep me up,

495
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,600
这段时间  我一直活在梦中
and lately, I've been loving my dreams,

496
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,340
有一个梦  我希望能成为现实"
and there's one in particular I hope comes true."

497
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,770
然后曼尼会把戒指给我
Manny gives me the ring.

498
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,840
我说  "歌洛莉亚"
I say, "Gloria --"

499
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,180
我愿意  杰  我愿意嫁给你
Yes, Jay! Yes, I marry you!

500
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,140
我喜欢我的新故事
I love my new story.

501
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,060
提醒下  我绝对会在他们的婚礼上哭的
Little heads-up -- there's no way I'm not crying at this wedding.

502
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,630
菲尔  你来这里的路上就哭了
Phil, you cried on the way here.

503
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,600
我当时已经泪在眼眶了
I was on the brink already.

504
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,050
我出门前看了《辣身舞》
I watched "Dirty Dancing" before we left.

505
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,200
我爸的短信
Text from my dad.

506
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,270
不好
Oh, no.

507
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,790
他要我过去看望他几天
He wants me to come visit him for a couple of days,

508
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,650
正好是孩子们都出门的那周
but it's right in the middle of our kid-free week.

509
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,620
太可惜了  我想你去两天没问题
Oh, that's too bad. I guess you could take two days.

510
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,790
我可能跟弗兰克说过
I may have mentioned to Frank

511
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,180
菲尔那周可能有空
that Phil might be available that week.

512
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,130
唯一比孩子们都出门更棒的
The only thing better than a kid-free week

513
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,280
就是再挤出几天让我独处
is a couple of days carved out just for mama.

514
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,950
完美
Perfect.

515
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,820
是的
Yeah.

516
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,140
还记得我向你求婚的那天吗
Hey, you remember the day I proposed to you?

517
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,290
当然记得
Of course I do.

518
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,130
我不太记得是哪一天了  但我记得
I don't remember the exact date, but, yes.

519
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,300
1994年3月19日
March 19, 1994.

520
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,550
是哦
Oh. Yeah.

521
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,700
那天下午我心情相当不好
I was in such a bad mood that afternoon.

522
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,000
圣帕特里克节喝醉后的第二天宿醉
I was on day two of a St. Patrick's hangover.

523
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,640
我不记得这点
I don't remember that.

524
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,580
我只记得我爱得有多疯狂
I just remember how crazy in love I was.

525
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,710
我等不及想向你求婚
I couldn't wait to ask you.

526
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,110
去接你的路上甚至闯了个红灯
I even ran a red light on the way to pick you up.

527
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,910
罚单我还留着
I still have the ticket.

528
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,590
不可能  你为什么要说这样的话
No, you don't. Why would you say something like that?

529
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,900
开什么玩笑  我在冲向我的新人生
Are you kidding me? I was racing to my life.

530
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,570
罚单就在我爸家
It's in a box at my dad's

531
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,140
和其他东西存在一个盒子里
with a bunch of other stuff --

532
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,150
包括你我相识的那场音乐会的节目单
The program from that concert where I met you...

533
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,970
你给我的写着假电话号码的火柴盒
...the matchbook with the fake number on it you gave me...

534
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,080
我们第一次约会的纪念酒杯
The souvenir goblet from our first date.

535
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,740
你觉得我会把这些美好回忆扔掉吗
You really think I'd throw away all those beautiful memories...

536
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,790
我的夫人
...milady?

537
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,040
我已经很久没再看看那些东西了
I haven't seen that stuff for a long time.

538
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,630
我去见我爸时一定要翻出来
I got to dig it out when I see my dad.

539
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,580
好了  别说了  对不起
Okay, stop. Sorry.

540
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,320
怎么了
What?

541
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,600
我让你爸爸找你的
I told your dad to call you

542
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,600
因为我想有几天单独清静的时间
because I wanted some time for myself.

543
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,250
是的  几天远离我那完美浪漫的丈夫
Yeah, couple of days away from my perfect, romantic husband,

544
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,280
我这个铁石心肠
who is far too good

545
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,060
冷血无情的机器人根本配不上的好丈夫
for this cold-hearted, bloodless wife-bot.

546
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,700
你不冷血
You have blood.

547
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,230
亲爱的  我只是把椅子放在了火炉前
Honey, I just put the chairs in front of the fireplace.

548
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,740
你却布置得这么浪漫
You made it romantic.

549
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,990
米奇尔说得对  我是个食尸鬼
Mitchell's right. I'm a ghoul.

550
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,090
过来
Come here.

551
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,870
你有你自己有趣的浪漫方式
You're romantic, too, in your own funny way.

552
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,690
我们只是不同
We're just different.

553
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,210
我更多愁善感些又如何
So what if I'm more sentimental?

554
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,070
是我妈
My mom.

555
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,270
我是说  当然
I mean, sure...

556
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,980
婚姻需要浪漫
Marriage needs romance.

557
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,410
知道还需要什么吗
You know what it also needs?

558
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,110
"菲尔联系过我  他建议..."
"Spoke to Phil, and he suggested --"

559
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,540
宽容
Forgiveness.

560
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,310
好了  请给我备胎
Okay. Spare, please.

561
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,690
是的  医生
Yes, doctor.

562
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,920
真不敢相信我们碰到这种事太多次了
I can't believe this has happened to us so many times,

563
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,050
居然有了换胎的固定程序
we actually have a system.

564
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,850
我知道  从你第一次看到千斤顶
Oh, I know. You've come a long way

565
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,550
这一路走来你可不容易
from the first time you ever saw a jack.

566
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,540
记得吗  你不相信...
Remember, you couldn't believe...

567
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,520
抱歉  这真是太棒了
I'm sorry. This is amazing.

568
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,310
我正在抬起一辆车
I am lifting a car right now.

569
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,140
我是全世界最强壮的男人
I am the strongest man in the world.

570
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,560
还记得那次在约塞米蒂国家公园
Oh, do you remember that time in Yosemite

571
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,280
雪下得非常大吗
when it was snowing so bad?

572
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,950
记得  那是六年前吗
Yeah. What was that, like six years ago?

573
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,180
老天  不  是在领养莉莉之前
Oh, gosh. No, it was before Lily,

574
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,540
所以至少有七八年了
so it was at least seven or eight.

575
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,430
老天  时间过得真快
God, it is -- it's going by so fast.

576
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,450
对  那还用说
Yeah. You're telling me.

577
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,030
知道吗  24小时之前  这下面
You know, it's a different world down there

578
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,830
是一个完全不同的世界
than it was 24 hours ago.

579
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,330
小卡  轮胎  轮胎
Cam, tire. Tire!

580
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,360
老天  我的天  我的天
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my -- oh, my god.

581
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,330
我的天
Oh, my god!

582
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,680
对住在那个黄色房子里的人来说
It's gonna be a different world

583
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,380
世界也将要变得不同了
for the people in that yellow house.

584
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,900
我今晚的计划绝对不是这样的
This is not at all how I saw the evening going.

585
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,330
亲爱的  你绝对想不到
Honey, you have no idea.

586
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,910
你还记得我们的第一间公寓吗
Do you remember our first apartment?

587
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,400
记得  你怎么想到那个了
Yes. What -- what made you think of that?

588
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,850
我不知道
I don't know.

589
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,040
星空
The stars.

590
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,160
好了  来吧  换胎
All right. Come on. Let's do this.

591
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,070
好
Yeah.

592
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,480
-我愿意  -我愿意
- Yes. - Yes.

593
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,780
大腿上有星星的这位美女
Hey, there, you with the stars on your thighs.

594
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,590
-什么  -是首老歌  我是想...
- Huh? - It's an old song. I thought I would...

595
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,690
我费个什么劲
Eh, why do I bother?

596
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,360
-这是什么  -曼尼给的
- What is this? - Oh. Oh, that's from Manny.

597
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,110
我本想过几天再给你
I was hoping to wait and give it to you in a couple of days.

598
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:57,370
你要记住他很好
But, uh, just remember that he's fine.

599
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,650
他离你的距离坐飞机就能到
He's only a plane ride away.

600
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:00,990
不错
Nice.

601
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,530
我去洗脸了
I'm going to wash my face.

602
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,540
好的
Okay.

603
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,890
希望我的表兄弟姐妹们不要带他去骑马
I hope that my cousins don't take him riding the horses

604
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,620
或是玩枪
or shooting the guns.

605
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,890
我知道他已经算是个成年男人了  但
I know that he's almost a man, but...

606
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,770
杰
Jay?

607
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,690
"你要照顾好杰

他周四体检后请给我打电话
Please call me after his checkup on Thursday.

609
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,590
我会非常想你们的"
I'll miss you guys so much."

610
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,740
真懂事  是吧
Nice, huh?

611
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,890
只是懂事吗
Nice?

612
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,850
我去把他的另一件睡袍寄给他
I'm gonna mail him his other robe.
