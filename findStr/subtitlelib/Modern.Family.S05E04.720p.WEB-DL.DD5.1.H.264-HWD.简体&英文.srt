1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,680
记得以前我们没孩子时
Remember before when we don't have kids,

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,360
周六可以整天躺在床上
we can just lie in bed on Saturday.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,800
我们就是那么怀上他们的
That's how we got them.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,430
我为什么非要如此性感
Why did I have to be so sexy?

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,860
几个月前  卢克加入了足球队
A few months ago, Luke joined the club soccer team.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,530
刚开始我们高兴得很
And at first, we were thrilled.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,760
后来我们意识到
But then we realized

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,870
那会占据我们整个周末
it takes over your whole weekend.

9
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,320
而且不像周末性爱马拉松那么过瘾
And not in the cool marathon way.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,900
卢克常常坐冷板凳
Luke sits on the bench a lot,

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,440
那就意味着我们要在烈日下坐上8个小时
which means we sit in the hot sun for like eight hours

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,350
就为了看他踢5分钟球
just to see him play five minutes.

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,610
但5分钟能发生很多  说说上周的事
But what a five minutes. Tell'em about last week.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,770
卢克用脸阻挡了一个进球
Oh, yeah. Luke stopped a goal with his face.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,790
-他不记得实在太可惜了  -是啊
- Too bad he doesn't remember that. - Yeah.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,690
要是我们今天不去看卢克比赛了呢
What if we sent Luke to the game without us today?

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,380
-这可不行  -为什么不行
- We can't do that. - Why not?

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,880
我们不会因为错过一次比赛
Missing one tournament doesn't

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,890
就成了糟糕的父母
make us bad parents.

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,500
我妈从没参加过我的活动
My mom never went to any of my stuff.

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,820
我不也好好的吗
I'm fine.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,240
她为什么不参加你的活动
Why didn't she go to any of your stuff?

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,920
因为她太争强好胜了
Because she was an incredibly competitive woman

24
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,960
不愿意看到我在某一方面表现出色
who didn't like to see me do very well at anything,

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,450
但我认为现在谁是赢家一目了然
but I think it's pretty clear who won.

26
00:00:58,570 --> 00:00:59,740
我现在还要工作
I'm working now, you know,

27
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,890
我非常需要利用周末时间
and I really need my weekends back

28
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,660
去做些杂事
to -- to catch up on errands.

29
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,170
我也说不清  但我感觉那样不对
I don't know. It just feels wrong.

30
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,950
要是你能把三周来没时间拆封的
Would it feel wrong to use that robot gutter cleaner

31
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,810
清沟机拿出来用还会觉得不对吗
that's been sitting in the box for the last three weeks?

32
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,880
不会  那挺好的  好极了
No, that would feel right -- so right.

33
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,610
我告诉过你我称之为"一扫光"吗
Did I tell you I call it "The gutter done"?

34
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,210
你说过  我喜欢"一扫光"
You did! I love "Gutter done."

35
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,000
你太有幽默感了  太好玩了
It's your sense of humor. It's so fun.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,820
好了  快别拍马屁了  你的目的达到了
Okay, stop drilling. You struck oil.

37
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,170
但前提是卢克也同意
But only if Luke's 100% cool with it.

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,910
当然了  我来搞定
Yeah, of course. I'm on it.

39
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,100
如果我们不去
You know, if we're not going,

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,910
就可以在床上多"玩"一会儿
we could stay in bed a little longer.

41
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,320
-不用了  谢谢  -好吧
- No, thank you. - Okay.

42
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,820

你拿着那些样品干嘛
What are you doing with those swatches?

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,790
她随时都可能过来
She's gonna be here any minute.

58
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,820
我早就让你把这些婚礼用品收起来了
I told you to put all this wedding stuff away.

59
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,070
这两个真的是最好的颜色选择吗
Are these really our top-two choices for color palette?

60
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,170
为什么都是白色的
Why are they both white?

61
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,760
我朋友凯莎也这么问为什么你和大爸都是白人
That's what my friend Keisha asks about you and daddy.

62
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,530
与其把这些东西都藏起来
Instead of hiding all this stuff,

63
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,410
你何不直接告诉小帕我们要结婚了呢
why don't you just tell Pam we're getting married?

64
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,630
我会告诉她的  得等她做好心理准备
I will, when she's ready.

65
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,580
得在一个宽阔的场地上小心翼翼地告诉她
Carefully and preferably in a large, open field.

66
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,810
她是你姐姐  又不是绿巨人
She's your sister, not the Hulk.

67
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,360
我姐小帕情感异常脆弱
My big sister, Pam, is emotionally fragile

68
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,290
至今依然单身  所以她一旦发现
and she's still single, so when she finds out

69
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,150
我在她之前结婚...
I'm getting married before she is --

70
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,880
小心点
Look out.

71
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,950
她会比黄昏时的猫头鹰还要凶残
She can be meaner than a barn owl at sunset.

72
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,210
因为猫头鹰那时候起床吗
Because that's when they wake up?

73
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,860
没错  对猫头鹰来说那是早晨
Yep. That's morning time for a barn owl.

74
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,790
-她来了  -快点  藏起来
- It's her! - Quick! Hide!

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,310
没关系的  莉莉  过来
It's okay, Lily. Come on.

76
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,580
把她的蝴蝶结发箍拿下来
Oh, take that bow out of her hair.

77
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,970
我不想在我姐面前炫耀
I don't want to rub our daughter's adorableness

78
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,070
我们美丽可爱的女儿
in my barren sister's face.

79
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,200
-她来了  -你好啊  小帕
- There she is! - Hey, Pam!

80
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,690
该死的航班把我的行李箱弄丢了
Well, the damn airline lost my trunk.

81
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,160
-害我要做新衣服了  -真糟糕
- Now I'm gonna have to make new clothes. - Oh, no.

82
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,140
是啊
Yep.

83
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,960
我得找点东西捏捏
I need to squeeze something.

84
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,110
-过来  莉莉  -我就免了吧
- Get over here, Lily. - I'm good.

85
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,610
她有点害羞
Yeah, well, she's shy.

86
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,930
小帕  我们有个重大消息
So, Pam, we've got some big news.

87
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,560
说起重大消息
Speaking of big news --

88
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,340
你记得我以前照顾过的那个丑姑娘吗  
You remember that little ugly girl i used to babysit,

89
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,030
名叫布兰妮・霍尔纳
Britney Horner?

90
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,080
-记得  -她去年夏天结婚了
- Yeah. - Well, she got married last summer,

91
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,490
现在怀上双胞胎了
and now she's pregnant with twins.

92
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,490
瞧瞧  丑女婚姻孩子双丰收  我一无所有
So, if you're keeping track, that's ugly -- 2, me -- nothing.

93
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,020
你们要说什么消息
What's your news?

94
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,140
就是...
Well...

95
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,650
我们要买一台新烘干机
We're getting a new dryer.

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,740
真为你们高兴
Well, I'm very happy for y'all.

97
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,570
谢谢
Thank you.

98
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,950
我怎么就从没买过新烘干机
How come I never get a new dryer?

99
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,040
妈  从你对外公有记忆起
Mom, in all the time you've known grandpa,

100
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,800
他曾经说过"流溢"这个词吗
has he ever used the word "Fluxions"?

101
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,380
我没听他说过这个"F"开头的词
That is not an f-word I have heard him use.

102
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,040
他在"和朋友比拼写"游戏中打败了我
He's beating me in "Words with friends."

103
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,130
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

104
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,800
你不是应该跟你的朋友一起玩
Shouldn't you be playing "Words with friends"

105
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,090
"和朋友比拼写"吗
with friends?

106
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,270
外公就是我的朋友啊
Grandpa is my friend.

107
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,650
当然了  一点都不可悲  什么
Of course he is. That's not sad. What?

108
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,690
早上好  伙计  戴着枕头干什么
Morning, buddy. What's with the pillow?

109
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,470
为了足球啊
It's for soccer.

110
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,920
看比赛看得我脖子都酸了
My neck gets pretty tired watching all those games.

111
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,230
是哦
Right.

112
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,590
对啊  我猜也是
Yeah, I'll bet.

113
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,470
听着  你爸爸和我刚在讨论
Say, listen, your dad and I were just talking

114
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,900
今天你可能不想我们陪你去比赛了
about you maybe wanting to go to the game without us today.

115
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,800
不过这完全由你决定
But it's totally up to you.

116
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,020
你要怎样都行  因为我们非常爱你
Whatever you want because we love you very much.

117
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,430
对  你可以跟你的队友一起去
Right. You can either ride with some of your teammates,

118
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,570
像洛杉矶国王队一样
like the L.A. Kings,

119
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,640
你也可以跟我们一起去
or you can ride with us,

120
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,660
就像歌洛莉亚和你外公带着乔去玩
like how Gloria and grandpa take Joe to playdates.

121
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,050
专业运动员  还是小屁孩
Professional athlete, little poopy baby --

122
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,890
-你决定  -我跟麦克斯一起去
- Your call. - I'll get a ride with Max.

123
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,360
-很好  -你确定真的没问题吗
- Great! - Are you sure it's okay?

124
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,460
对啊  没事啊
Yeah, it's fine.

125
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,830
我能借一下你的眼罩吗
Hey, can I borrow your sleep mask?

126
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,540
-当然  -太好了
- You bet. - Awesome.

127
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,060
好耶  我太爱这孩子了
Yes! I love that kid.

128
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,070
如果我们只有这一个孩子
Can you imagine how easy it would be

129
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,260
生活该是多么轻松啊
if it was just him?

130
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,260
我是说...
I mean...

131
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,470
我知道你的意思
I know what you mean.

132
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,370
你觉得那样算叠好了吗
You call that folded?

133
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,710
军队级细致严谨的品格哪里去了
Where's that military precision?

134
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,060
我们海军不用叠连体衣
We didn't fold many onesies in the navy.

135
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,320
我回来了
I'm back!

136
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,910
医生怎么说
What did the doctor say?

137
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,020
他说我的眼睛没问题
He said my eyes are perfect.

138
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,740
他说这话时眼睛看着哪里呢
Where was he looking when he said it?

139
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,090
我确信歌洛莉亚需要配副眼镜
Pretty sure Gloria needs glasses.

140
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,310
过去几个月  她一直在挣扎
The last couple of months, she's been struggling.

141
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,410
我要这个  看起来很不错
I'll take this one. It looks very good.

142
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,260
那是他们的地址  老花眼
That's their address, Magoo.

143
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,290
他有测试你的视力吗
Did he even give you an eye test?

144
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,420
他先拿勺子盖住一只眼睛
He put the spoon in one eye,

145
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,510
然后又盖住另一只
the spoon in the other eye,

146
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,320
又拿眼药水滴了滴
The puff puff, the eye drops.

147
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,860
两眼都是完美的1.0  谁才是老花眼
20/20. Now who's the Magoo?

148
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,390
那是什么鸟语
What the hell language was that?

149
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,730
你看到她新做的指甲吗
Did you see that fresh coat of nail polish?

150
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,110
她根本没去看医生
She never went to the doctor.

151
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,070
她为什么要撒谎
Why would she lie?

152
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,300
她很自负  曼尼
She's vain, Manny.

153
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,770
她不想戴眼镜
She doesn't want to wear glasses.

154
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,380
那她只是在伤害她自己
Well, she's only hurting herself.

155
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,210
-想必你一定饿了  -饿死了
- Okay, I hope you're hungry. - Starving.

156
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,680
那架该死的航班没有烤牛肉了
That damn airline ran out of roast beef.

157
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,690
还试图说服我
Tried to fast talk me

158
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,210
吃什么"阴嘴豆泥"
into eating something called "Hoo-mus."

159
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,140
鹰嘴豆泥  其实非常美味
Oh, hummus -- it's actually really delicious.

160
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,770
你会喜欢...
You would like tha-- uh. Oh.

161
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,200
-这是什么  -是个玩偶
- What's this? - Oh, uh, that's an action figure.

162
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,600
是一对新郎
It's two grooms.

163
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,000
有天骄阳似火  两个玩偶
They melted together in the car

164
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,350
在车里融化在一起了
on a very, very hot day.

165
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,400
那天43度
It was 103.

166
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,600
我的爹地们要结婚了
My daddies are getting married.

167
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,630
你的两位爸爸要结婚了吗
Your dads are getting married?

168
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,430
这不科学啊
That can't be right.

169
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,180
我的朋友凯莎也这样说
That's what my friend Keisha says.

170
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,610
是真的吗
Is this true?

171
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,260
小帕  说实话  我们是打算告诉你的
Pam, honest to goodness, we were gonna tell you.

172
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,750
你快过来
Get over here, you!

173
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,570
她抱住我了
She's got me.

174
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,150
天啊
Well, damn!

175
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,020
这是我听过的最好的消息
This is the greatest news I've ever heard!

176
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,360
听你这样说我真高兴  小帕
Oh, I am so happy to hear you say that, Pam.

177
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,360
当然啦
Of course. Oh!

178
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,790
我想让我的小弟弟得到幸福
I want my baby brother to be happy.

179
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,230
既然在分享好消息  我也有一个
And as long as we're sharing, I have some news.

180
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,660
你记得博・约翰逊吗
You remember Bo Johnson?

181
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,370
天啊  我怎么会忘记
Oh, my gosh, how could I forget? Oh!

182
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,090
他是我的第一个暗恋对象
He was my first crush.

183
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,180
求你别告诉我他那张帅气的脸毁了
Please tell me nothing happened to his face.

184
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,550
他摔在什么东西上了
What did he fall into?

185
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,370
他和我摔入爱河了
He fell into me.

186
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,780
我们订婚了
We're engaged!

187
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,220
-你说什么  -博和我要结婚了
- Say what? - Bo and I are getting married!

188
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,470
太棒了  小卡  难道这不是好消息吗
That is fantastic! Cam, isn't this great news?

189
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,520
你快过来
Come here, you. Oh!

190
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,290
是啊  太棒了
Yeah. So great.

191
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,860
快来加入我  快
Get in on this! Come on!

192
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,120
谢谢你跳起来
Thank you for jumping.

193
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,340
我并不为错过卢克的足球比赛而内疚
I didn't feel guilty for missing Luke's soccer tournament

194
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,130
因为我有一大堆家务事
because I had a ton of errands

195
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,350
我觉得我得花一整天才能做完
I figured would take me all day to finish.

196
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,270
但不知为什么  事情办得相当顺利
But for some weird reason, I was flying through my list.

197
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,320
我每次都排到最短的队
I ended up in every short line.

198
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,240
路上也是一路绿灯
I made every green light.

199
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,750
这真是报应
It was the ultimate karmic bitch-slap.

200
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,170
因为我突然无事可做了
Because suddenly I had no more errands,

201
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,790
也就是说没有借口了
which meant no more excuses,

202
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,130
我必须得去无聊的足球比赛了
which meant me at that boring soccer tournament.

203
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,160
嗨  你来啦
Hi. There you are.

204
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,060
你儿子踢得棒极了
Your son is playing so great.

205
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,690
-不  我是卢克的妈妈  -我知道
- No, I'm Luke's mom. - No, I know.

206
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,220
-他今天表现得非常好  -卢克吗
- He's been amazing all day. - Luke?

207
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,830
卢克啊
Oh! Luke?

208
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,510
来一杯吗
Here, you want one?

209
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,180
不用  谢谢  我今天喝过咖啡了
Uh, no, thanks. I'm coffeed out.

210
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,450
-亲爱的  这是桑格利亚酒  -好吧
- Oh, honey, it's sangria. - Well, all right.

211
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,340
毋庸置疑了  外公在作弊
Okay, that's it. Grandpa's cheating.

212
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,340
[cheat一词多意: 作弊/劈腿]

213
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,100
对歌洛莉亚吗
On Gloria?

214
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,600
他怎么可能找到个更性感的
How could he possibly do better?

215
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,570
不  不是对歌洛莉亚  是这个游戏
No, not on Gloria -- on this game.

216
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,980
我从来没输给谁过
I've never lost it to anyone.

217
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,310
继续和外公玩单词游戏
Keep playing word games with grandpa,

218
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,520
你永远都别想了[失去贞操]
and you never will.

219
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,670
姑娘们
Hey, girls!

220
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,830
那东西是什么
Hey. What is that thing?

221
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,900
你是问它叫什么
What do they call it,

222
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,350
还是问它应该被叫做什么
or what should they have called it?

223
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,270
-不想知道了  -等等等等
- Never mind. - Uh, wait, wait, wait!

224
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,820
这是清沟机
It's a gutter cleaner.

225
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,530
女士们  我向你们展示未来
Ladies, I give you the future.

226
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,440
你们见过我多少次从梯子上摔下来啊
How many times have you girls seen me fall off this ladder?

227
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,240
现在摔倒的次数会少一些了
Now that's gonna happen less.

228
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,620
看来你的
Looks like your, uh,

229
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,630
清沟机卡在什么东西上了
gutter cleaner is stuck on something.

230
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,160
没关系
Not a problem.

231
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,740
这神器能检测出堵塞物  然后加大功率
This baby detects blockage and then ramps up the power.

232
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,580
所以我给它取了个外号  "一扫光"
That's why I've nicknamed it "The gutter done."

233
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,680
-爸爸  -停下
- Dad! - Stop!

234
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,630
抱歉  已经停不下来了
Sorry, it's such a missed opportunity.

235
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,200
天啊  天啊  天啊
Aah! Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god!

236
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,960
-怎么  出什么事了  -这是个鸟巢
- What? What happened? - It's a bird's nest!

237
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,810
-不是吧  -小鸟都死了
- No! - And they're all dead!

238
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,040
-天啊  -你杀了它们
- Oh, my god! - You killed them!

239
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,320
宝贝  凶手不是我
Honey, it wasn't me!

240
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,000
而是机器人
It was the robot!

241
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,900
瞧瞧它
Look at it.

242
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,450
它还浑然不知
It doesn't know!

243
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,920
对不起
I'm sorry!

244
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,690
妈妈  妈妈  来帮忙
Mom! Mom! Help!

245
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,890
怎么了  出什么事了
What?! What happened?!

246
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,900
-我刚吃了一把老鼠药  -为什么
- I just ate a handful of this rat poison. - Why?!

247
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,920
我以为这是什锦干果仁
I thought it was trail mix.

248
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,320
我怎么把它们放在一起了
Why do I keep it so close together?

249
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,460
我去叫救护车
I'll call 911!

250
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,410
给  读出盒子上的内容
Here, read the box!

251
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,520
告诉我上面写着要怎么做
Tell me what it says to do!

252
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,460
快
Hurry!

253
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,400
-上面写着...  -我没多少时间了
- It says... - I don't have much time!

254
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,830
里面...
In the...

255
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,610
-我就这样死了  -什么
- And I'm dead. - What?

256
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,350
你宁愿你老公被毒死
You'd rather kill your husband

257
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,200
也不愿承认你需要戴眼镜
than admit you need glasses.

258
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,210
-妈  你真狠心  -这不是毒药吗
- Wow, mom. - It's not poison?

259
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,060
的确有老鼠药
Oh, there's rat poison,

260
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,430
我也的确把它和什锦干果仁放得很近
and I do keep it dangerously close to the trail mix,

261
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,750
但这是为了指出
but this was to point out

262
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,420
你的虚荣可能是致命的
that your vanity could be fatal.

263
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,920
我就知道你们在骗我
I knew this was all a trick.

264
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,990
所以我才假装看不清盒子上的字
That's why I acted like I couldn't read that box!

265
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,780
有多少人会这么用心良苦假装死掉啊
How many people have to pretend to die, Gloria?

266
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,620
这简直不合情理
It just doesn't make any sense.

267
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,120
小帕和博・约翰逊
Pam and Bo Johnson?

268
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,280
-我的博・约翰逊  -什么叫"我的"
- My Bo Johnson? - "My"?

269
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,070
你为旧情人这么吃醋  我该为此烦恼吗
Should it bother me that you're this jealous of an old crush?

270
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,310
别说傻话了
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

271
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,440
博是直男
Bo is straight.

272
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,400
他可能永远不会爱上我
He'd probably never go for me.

273
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,230
天啊  是博打来的
Oh, my gosh, it is Bo!

274
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,850
瞧瞧  他比以前更帅了
Look, he's hotter than ever.

275
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,390
-我要接电话  -不行
- I'm gonna answer it. - No, you can't.

276
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,660
我可以  我们也算是一家人了
Yes, I can. We're practically family.

277
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,400
喂  哥们  我是小卡
Hey, dude. It's Cam.

278
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,320
小卡在哪呢
Where?

279
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,340
挺不错的  非常非常好
Been good -- been real, real good.

280
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,690
你和小帕在一起了啊
So, you and Pam, huh?

281
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,890
你最好对我老姐好一点
Hey, better be good to my old sis,

282
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,630
不然我就把你摔倒在地
or I'll have to wrestle you down.

283
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,360
-天啊  -问你个问题
- Oh, my God. - Hey, question --

284
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,090
我给你做的友谊手镯你还留着吗
Do you still have that friendship bracelet that I made for you?

285
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,880
好吧
Oh, okay.

286
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,080
好吧  你先忙  我让小帕给你回电话
Yeah, okay, if you're busy, I'll have Pam call you back.

287
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,880
博  恭喜你啊
Hey, and, Bo, congratulations.

288
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:14,970
你也是
You too.

289
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,930
-你能相信吗  -你又回归基佬啦
- Can you believe it? - Oh, and we're gay again.

290
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,070
这完全不合情理
It just doesn't make sense.

291
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,040
他肯定是对我们的钻井权有企图
I mean, he's got to be after our drilling rights.

292
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,130
我就知道
I knew it.

293
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,480
所以我才不想告诉你
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

294
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,910
我知道你没法承受你的梦中情人
I knew you couldn't stand the thought

295
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,090
被我搞定了的这个现实
of me landing the man of your dreams!

296
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,230
"梦中情人"这词太过了
"Dreams" is strong.

297
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,710
信不信由你  博和我真心相爱
Believe it or not, Bo and I are in love.

298
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,270
他觉得我很漂亮  他是对的
He thinks I'm beautiful, and he's right.

299
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,960
顺便说一句  博的土地是我们家的两倍大
And for the record, Bo has twice the land we do.

300
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,620
他对我的钻井权绝对没有半点兴趣
He has absolutely no interest in my drilling rights!

301
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,880
至少不是那种"钻"井权
Not that kind, at least.

302
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,800
好了  大家都淡定
Okay, let's just relax.

303
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,610
来吧  小帕  想再把我抱起来吗
Hey, hey, come on, Pam, do you want to pick me up again?

304
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,670
-他们警告过我  -谁警告过你
- They warned me, you know. - Who warned you?

305
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,540
全家人都说你会接受不了这个现实
The whole family said you wouldn't take it well.

306
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,180
自从你因为无法在农场存活
Ever since you moved to the city

307
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,600
而不得不搬到城里以后
'cause you couldn't hack it on the farm.

308
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,880
-"无法存活"  -是的  没错
- "Couldn't hack it"?  - Yeah, that's right.

309
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,010
大家都知道  小卡  你不是农场强人
Everyone knows, Cam, you're not farm strong.

310
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,740
收回你说的话  帕梅隆・杰西卡・塔克
You take that back, Pameron Jessica Tucker!

311
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,660
我才不呢  你是个软弱的娘炮
I will not! You are weak and weepy.

312
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,530
所以我们什么都不敢告诉你
That's why we can't ever say anything to you

313
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,800
因为我们知道你会反应过度闹个歇斯底里
'cause we know you'll crumble into a big heaping mess!

314
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,760
你说我才是那个需要别人小心对待
Oh, are you saying I'm the one people have to step around --

315
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,240
那个家里的爱哭鬼小帕吗
that I'm the Pam of the family?

316
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,860
你是说家里的爱哭鬼小卡吧
You mean the Cam of the family?!

317
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,440
因为大家都这么叫你
'cause that's what we all call it!

318
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,090
好了  够了
Okay, that's enough!

319
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,800
够了  够了
That's enough! That's enough!

320
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,540
你知道吗  我可是奶奶的最爱
You know what? Well, I was gammy's favorite!

321
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,690
-够了  -真的吗
- That's enough! - Really?

322
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,460
-当然  -拜托  够了
- Yeah! - Come on! Enough!

323
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,050
住嘴
No!

324
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,780
帕"梅隆"  你家人都叫这名儿吗
Seriously -- Pameron?

325
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,090
好球  卢克
Oh! Way to go, Luke!

326
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,630
-这孩子太棒了  -太棒了
- The kid's amazing. - Amazing.

327
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,080
-太厉害了  -是吧  喂
- So great. - Right? Hello?

328
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,610
-克莱尔  -菲尔
- Claire? - Phil?

329
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,020
亲爱的  我正想打给你呢
Oh, hi, honey, I was -- I was just about to call you.

330
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,890
我弄死了一窝小鸟
I killed a bunch of baby birds.

331
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,940
-什么  -我的机器人把鸟窝给端了
- What? - My robot wiped out the nest.

332
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,950
现在鸟妈妈正瞪着我呢
And now the mom's just staring at me.

333
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,970
它们能记住人的长相
They recognize faces, you know.

334
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,040
我在纪录片上看到过
I saw it in a documentary.

335
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,810
亲爱的  我相信那只是个意外而已
Sweetie, I'm sure it was just an accident.

336
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,530
要是我们去看卢克的比赛
None of this would have happened

337
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,800
就不会发生这种事情了
if we'd just gone to Luke's game.

338
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,670
-我们这父母做得太差劲了  -不会
- We're terrible parents for not going. - No. No.

339
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,250
那是哨声吗  你在哪里
Was that a whistle? Where are you?

340
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,080
我刚路过一个建筑工地
Um, I-I'm just walking by a construction site.

341
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,280
变态
Pervs!

342
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,520
对不起  对不起  没说你
Sorry. Sorry. Not you.

343
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,030
但愿卢克不会怪我们
I hope Luke's not mad at us.

344
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,500
不会  他没事的  亲爱的
No, he's fine, honey.

345
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,570
也可能有事  也可能会怪我们
Or he's not. He -- he could be mad.

346
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,920
我们不知道  我们猜不到
We don't know. We won't -- we won't know.

347
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,110
我马上就回去了
I'll -- I'll be home soon, though.

348
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,750
我爱你  好的  再见
I love you. Okay, bye-bye.

349
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,130
谢谢你  棒极了
Thank you. It was great.

350
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,660
卢克  卢克  卢克
Hey, Luke, Luke, Luke,

351
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,880
别告诉你爸我来过  你踢得真棒
Don't tell your dad I was here, all right? Great game.

352
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,030
克莱尔
Claire?

353
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,590
克莱尔
Claire?

354
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,370
跟爸爸说晚安
Say good night to daddy.

355
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,180
晚安  好儿子
Mwah! Good night, my boy.

356
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,860
外公  你今天早上拼的那个词不错啊
Hey, grandpa, great word you played earlier today.

357
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,330
"朔望"到底是什么意思
What does "Syzygy" even mean?

358
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,460
意思是能得45分
It means 45 points. Ha!

359
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,230
大家好  你们还记得我姐小帕吧
Hey, everybody, you remember my sister, Pam.

360
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,550
小帕  你好
Oh, hi, Pam.

361
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,600
她来探望大家  顺便中伤你们几句
She's here to pay a visit and cast aspersions.

362
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,900
-别小孩子气了  -你才小孩子气
- Oh, grow up. - You grow up.

363
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,070
接得真好
Real good one.

364
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,440
大家好  我带了野猪肉
Hi, y'all. I brought boar.

365
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,110
我来帮你一起处理一下
Oh. Well, let me give you a hand with that.

366
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,040
小卡  听着  我知道你很生气
Cam, look, I know you're upset,

367
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,050
不过今晚就尽量别计较这个了
But please just try and let it go tonight.

368
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,190
她竟然说我才是那个脆弱敏感的人
Well, can you believe she said I'm the emotionally fragile one?

369
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,410
那简直是胡言乱语吧
I mean, how crazy is that?

370
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,520
-天啊  -"天啊"
- Boy. - "Boy"?

371
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,490
你是在露骨地表明
Is that your thinly veiled

372
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,840
你赞成她的说法吗
way of saying you agree with her?

373
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,220
你听着
Okay, you know what?

374
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,220
如果我很脆弱  我就会生气
If I was fragile, I would care,

375
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,270
可我没有  所以我不脆弱
but I'm not, so I don't.

376
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,980
-好的  -好的
- Good. - Good.

377
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,740
还有你知道吗  这衬衫太难看了
And you know what? That shirt washes you out,

378
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,250
要是有人把你当成黄皮蜡烛可别怪人家
so don't be shocked when someone mistakes you for a beige candle.

379
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,340
大家好
Hey, everyone.

380
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,540
-你好  卢克  -你好啊  伙计
- Hi, Luke. - Hey, buddy.

381
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,420
我很抱歉错过了你的比赛
I'm so sorry I missed your game.

382
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,650
我们都很抱歉错过了你的比赛
We are both so sorry we missed your game.

383
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,800
冥冥中我已经受到了惩罚
The universe punished me.

384
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,810
我对一群小乌鸦做了非常可怕的事情
I did something awful to a bunch of baby crows.

385
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,230
其实  那不叫"群鸦"
Actually, it's not a bunch of crows.

386
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,230
[murder(谋杀)是crows(乌鸦)的集体名词形式]

387
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,270
那该叫"群杀"
It's called a murder.

388
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,970
我知道我做了什么
I know what I did!

389
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
-比赛怎么样  -还行  没啥特别
- How was your game? - Fine. Nothing special.

390
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,420
你说"还行  没啥特别"是啥意思
What do you mean, "Fine, nothing special"?

391
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,950
好吧  其实16岁那组里有个妞
Well, there was this girl on the 16-year-old team

392
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,220
没穿胸罩
who wasn't wearing a bra.

393
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,930
所以还挺不错的
So that was cool.

394
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,180
可是乔什他妈给我发了短信
But Josh's mom texted me.

395
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,080
她说你踢得可好了
She said you were having a great game.

396
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,350
她喝多了
She drinks.

397
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,270
我马上就回来
I-I'll be right back.

398
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,080
-你好  菲尔  -你好  小帕
- Hey, Phil. - Hey, Pam.

399
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,450
不好意思
Oh. Sorry.

400
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,780
又是我爸妈
It's my parents again.

401
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,000
我快要结婚了
I'm getting married soon,

402
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,910
他们现在就呈现空"巢"老人的症状了
and they're already acting like they have empty nest syndrome.

403
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,830
我很感谢你
I appreciate you not saying

404
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,140
没跟你爸说我去看比赛的事
anything to your dad about me being there,

405
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,200
可你为何不告诉他你在赛场上的精彩表现
but why aren't you telling him what a great game you played?

406
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,350
我能看出来他错过比赛已经很难过了
I can tell he feels bad enough for missing it.

407
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,900
我不想让他感觉更糟
I don't want to make him feel worse.

408
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,990
我搞砸了
I screwed up.

409
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,090
怎么了  出什么事了
Why? What's wrong?

410
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,400
我劝菲尔别去看卢克的比赛
I talked Phil into skipping Luke's game,

411
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,880
可是我去看了  他在赛场上发挥出色
and then I went, and, of course, he played the game of his life.

412
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,830
但现在卢克却不想
But Luke doesn't want to

413
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,850
跟菲尔谈那场比赛的事了
tell Phil about the game now

414
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,160
因为他不想伤害菲尔的感情
because he doesn't want to hurt his feelings.

415
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,600
我觉得卢克护着他爸的做法很有爱
Oh, well, I think it's sweet that Luke's protecting Phil.

416
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,660
在我们家  我们都得护着我姐姐
You know, we all have to protect my sister in my family

417
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,550
因为她敏感得可怕
because she's a disaster.

418
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,510
你能看得出来  对吧
I mean, you can see it, right?

419
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,770
我觉得她带猪肉来参加派对是挺奇葩的
I think it was a little weird she brought pig to a party.

420
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,450
只有我能说我姐姐
Hey! I can say it.

421
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,610
亲爱的
Hey, hon.

422
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,800
我为我之前的行为向你道歉
I'm sorry about what I did before.

423
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,160
我看到了这个  我觉得你戴上一定好看
I saw this, and I thought it would look beautiful on you.

424
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,970
你知道我就是不能生你的气
You know I can't stay mad at you

425
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,660
尤其是你给我买...
when you buy me...

426
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,860
眼镜  你这个混蛋
glasses, you son of a bitch!

427
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,760
戴上试试  你看起来还是会很迷人的
Just try 'em on. You'll still look gorgeous.

428
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,060
你买助听器那天我会戴上的
I will try them on when you buy hearing aids!

429
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,080
我的听力没什么问题啊
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.

430
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,830
我手机上有一款测试听力的应用
Um, I have a, uh, hearing-test app on my phone.

431
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,850
我们测测看
Let's do it!

432
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,590
-你来测  -好的
- You do it! - Okay.

433
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,610
60岁以下的人应该都能听到这个声音
Everybody under the age of 60 should be able to hear this.

434
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,560
-没错  听到了  -很清楚
- Yes. Heard that. - Yeah, definitely.

435
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,760
什么  你们撒谎  你们根本什么都没听着
What? You're lying. You didn't hear anything.

436
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,130
我们听见了  看到没  你聋了
We did! You see, you're deaf!

437
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,220
好的  70岁以下的
Okay, 70.

438
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,480
听见了
Mm-hmm. Yes.

439
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,700
这是什么  是她让你们这么做的吗
Oh, what is th-- did she put you up to this?

440
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,960
这样  外公  我放个声音大点儿的
Here, grandpa, I'll play you something even louder.

441
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,100
好的  这回我听见了
Okay, I heard that one.

442
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,900
我什么都没按
I didn't press anything.

443
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,700
看啊  谁作弊了啊
Oh, look who's a cheater.

444
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,020
不用担心  老大
Don't worry about it, big guy.

445
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,010
我闻不到柠檬的"酸味儿"
I have trouble smelling lemons.

446
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:38,410
我受够了
You know, I don't need any of this.

447
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,530
不过  我可以告诉你们我能听清楚什么
But I'll tell you what I can hear loud and clear.

448
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,360
那就是你们蹭饭时吧嗒嘴的声音
The sound of you all munching free food.

449
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,710
拜托  爸
Oh, come on, dad,

450
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,760
你是不是有点儿过于敏感了
aren't you being a little oversensitive?

451
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,450
这个问题可以请教我姐  小帕
Oh, well, we can consult my sister, Pam.

452
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,630
她自诩为"敏感学"专家
She's the self-appointed sensitivity expert.

453
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,580
-别计较了吧  -我就要计较
- Oh, let it go. - I will not let it go.

454
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,510
其实  我正想
In fact, I would like

455
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,470
让大家现在对我说实话
everyone to be honest with me, please, right now.

456
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,860
不用客气
No sugar-coating.

457
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,670
我姐姐似乎觉得你们大家
My sister here seems to think you all

458
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,870
-对我说话就得如履蛋壳  小心翼翼  -蛋壳
- have to walk on eggshells around me. - Eggshells.

459
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,230
你们是否觉得我很脆弱
Do you all think I'm so fragile

460
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,320
因为害怕我反应过度
you can't tell me things

461
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,840
而不敢告诉我一些事
for fear of how I will react?

462
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,280
-这个嘛  -克莱尔  打住  闭嘴
- Well. - Claire, don't. Zip. Bup-bup-bup.

463
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,010
不  请让她说
No, let her talk, please.

464
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,380
克莱尔  请发言
Claire, you have the floor.

465
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,890
好吧  你并不是不脆弱
W-well, you're not not fragile.

466
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,620
好吧  你不如举个例子
Okay, well, why don't you give me an example

467
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,490
说件因为担心我无法接受
of something you haven't told me

468
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,410
而没有告诉我的事
because you were worried I couldn't handle it?

469
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,480
说吧
Go on.

470
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,790
好的
All right.

471
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,540
上周我们本来约好吃午饭
Last week when we were supposed to have lunch

472
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,810
你取消了
and you canceled...

473
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,350
碧昂丝也在那餐厅
Beyonce was at the restaurant.

474
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,920
好吧  是歌手碧昂丝还是胡娇的狗
Okay. The singer or Pepper's dog?

475
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,150
歌手碧昂丝
The singer.

476
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,590
我离开餐厅时
And when I was leaving,

477
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,300
停在她身边打了个招呼
I-I-I stopped and I said hello to her

478
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,870
我们大概聊了十分钟
and we chatted for like 10 minutes.

479
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,430
好的  那真是太棒了
Okay, that's great.

480
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,150
我很高兴你有这样的经历
I'm glad you had that experience?

481
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,500
只是我不知道你跟她有什么好聊的
I mean, I don't know what you talked to her about,

482
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,940
因为她的歌你基本一无所知
seeing that you don't know any of her songs

483
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,160
除了《单身女人》
other than "Single ladies,"

484
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,840
那是众人皆知的口水歌
Which everyone knows.

485
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,050
-我爱那首歌  -我很意外你还听得到
- I love that song. － I'm surprised you can hear it.

486
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,640
真有意思  谁饿了
Well, this was fun. Who's hungry?

487
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,650
那只小公猪呢
Hey, where's that boar?

488
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,070
还有人要说吗
Okay, anyone else?

489
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,780
既然把话说开了
Well, since we're coming clean,

490
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,600
你太滥用"非凡"这个词了
you overuse the word "Divine."

491
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
只是一个冰淇淋三明治而已
It's just an ice-cream sandwich.

492
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,390
你却哭着喊着说"非凡"
You're the boy who cried "Divine."

493
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,740
好吧  以前我没注意到
Okay. Was not aware of that.

494
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,230
-知道了  -我有话说
- Duly noted. - Hey, I got one.

495
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,910
还记得圣诞节时你送我的蓝色盘式电话吗
Remember that blue rotary phone you gave me for Christmas?

496
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,440
-记得  -我扔了
- Yes. - I tossed it.

497
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,960
好的  可以问下原因吗
Okay. May I ask the reason?

498
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,790
让我觉得自己像
It made me feel like

499
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,360
《再见小鸟》里的安-玛格丽特
Ann-Margret in "Bye-bye Birdie."

500
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,970
-为何又要提到鸟  -还有人要说吗
- Why?! - Okay, anyone else?

501
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,300
我不喜欢
I don't really like the

502
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,220
-袖口这么夸张的衬衫  -不好意思
- shirts with the crazy cuffs. - Oh, I'm sorry.

503
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,950
你能把胸部压下去吗
Can you push your boobs down?

504
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,140
因为我听不到你说话
Because I couldn't hear you.

505
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,330
-又来了  -不  没有来
- Here we go. - No, no, here we don't go.

506
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,280
没事  我没事  好吗
This is fine. I'm fine, okay?

507
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,780
有时候你给我读睡前故事
Sometimes when you read to me,

508
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,330
我会假装睡着让你走
I pretend to fall asleep so you'll go.

509
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,590
我听到声音了
I heard that one.

510
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,360
你们的话我全听得一清二楚
Well, I heard you all loud and clear.

511
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,310
我得去洗手间
I have to use the restroom.

512
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,890
小卡  你很敏感又如何
So, Cam, you're sensitive.

513
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,680
有什么关系  这是你的优点之一
Big deal. It's one of your best qualities.

514
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,190
谢谢你  菲尔
Thank you, Phil,

515
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,130
很抱歉你那喜欢碧昂丝的老婆
and I'm sorry your Beyonce-loving wife

516
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,730
去看了卢克的比赛没带你
went to Luke's game without you.

517
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,750
看见没  农场强人
See? Farm strong!

518
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,120
你去看了卢克的比赛吗
You went to Luke's game?

519
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,850
我去了  菲尔  真是对不起
I did, Phil, and I am so sorry.

520
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,140
我本来没想去的
I did not mean to.

521
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,770
但他的表现太精彩了
But then he started playing the most amazing game,

522
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,050
然后我就舍不得走了
and I got so wrapped up in it.

523
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,370
我知道我应该打电话
I know I should have called.

524
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,230
对  你应该打电话
Yeah, you should've called.

525
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,050
你很厉害吗
You were amazing?

526
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,900
他太棒了  你要是去了就好了
Oh, he was incredible. I wish you'd been there.

527
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,070
那你为什么不让我去看
Then why'd you make me skip it?!

528
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,380
我就知道你有天赋
I knew you had it in you!

529
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,920
教练说他下周就能开球了
Oh, coach said he's gonna start next week.

530
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,710
你要开球吗  我太生你的气了
You're starting? I'm so mad at you!

531
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,530
我真为你骄傲
I'm so proud of you!

532
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,130
-你还好吗  -很好
- Hey, how are you doing in here? - Fine.

533
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,730
我刚才发脾气  现在有些不好意思
I'm a little embarrassed about my outburst,

534
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,090
不过...
but otherwise...

535
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,590
你一下子要接受的东西太多了
You had a lot to take in.

536
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,940
作为律师  我应该早告诉你
As a lawyer, I should've told you,

537
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,070
永远不要问不想知道答案的问题
never ask questions you don't want the answer to.

538
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,910
我真的有那么糟吗
Am I really that much of a mess?

539
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,520
你没有听到我说的话吗
Are you not listening to me?

540
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,550
-有我站的地方吗  -不多
- Hey. Room in here for me? - Not really.

541
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,130
我为我说的话真心道歉
Look, I'm real sorry I said what I said.

542
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,310
不  你说得对
No, no, you're right.

543
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,820
我是"家里的爱哭鬼小卡"
I am the Cam of the family.

544
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,960
显然  我现在是"两个家里的小卡"
Apparently, I'm the Cam of two families, so...

545
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,850
你听到坏消息时
So what if you go a little cuckoo

546
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,310
会反应过度又怎么了
when you get bad news?

547
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,830
你听到好消息时也会反应过度
You also go all cuckoo when you hear good news.

548
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,840
这是我最喜欢你的一点
It's one of the things I love most about you.

549
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,880
不  这是真的
No, that's -- that's true.

550
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,470
我有好消息时  总是第一个
You're the -- you're the first person I call

551
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,350
打电话给你
when I have good news.

552
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,830
还记得我取下成人牙箍吗
I mean, remember when I got my adult braces removed?

553
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,910
你的牙齿看起来真是美得非凡
Your teeth look divi-- divine.

554
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,120
瞧  我也没办法  我就是天生乱激动
See? I can't help it. I'm a celebrator.

555
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,520
你当然是的
Of course you are.

556
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,750
我应该庆祝博那么幸运
And I should have celebrated how lucky Bo is

557
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,480
能找到你这么好的女人
to land a great gal like you.

558
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,370
瞧我  哭得跟小卡一样
Look at me. I'm crying like a Cam.

559
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,620
抱歉  不好的旧习惯
Sorry, old habits.

560
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,170
-我让你出丑你生气了吗  -别说了
- Are you mad because I embarrassed you? - Forget about it.

561
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,350
我也不会逼你戴眼镜了
And I'm gonna ease up on the glasses, too.

562
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
我只是担心
It's just that I worry, you know,

563
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,230
你什么也看不到
you're not seeing everything.

564
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,810
我老了  杰
I'm getting old, Jay.

565
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:39,830
曼尼小时候
When Manny was little,

566
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,340
我总是整天跟着他跑
I used to run around with him all day

567
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,870
一点也不累
without getting tired.

568
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,070
今天在乔的幼教班上
Today at Joe's baby class,

569
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,070
一个6岁的孩子得把我从球池里拉出来
a 6-year-old had to pull me out of the ball pit.

570
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,780
慢着  以前曼尼喜欢乱跑吗
Hold on. Manny used to run around?

571
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,640
所有的妈妈都那么年轻神气
All the mothers are so young and perky.

572
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,520
我讨厌做那里最老的一个
I hate being the oldest one there.

573
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,470
我恰恰喜欢你变老
Well, I for one love that you're getting older.

574
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,330
让我觉得和你更亲近了
It makes me feel closer to you.

575
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,360
就算我长皱纹皮肤松弛了你也会喜欢吗
So you'll like it if I get all wrinkly and saggy?

576
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,860
我可不会说非要那样才好
Well, I wouldn't make it a goal.

577
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,450
好吧  我戴眼镜
Okay, I'll wear them.

578
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,020
怎么了
What?

579
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,570
没什么
Nothing.

580
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,870
你这里有皱纹
You have lines there.

581
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,000
我现在可以看得非常清楚
I can see them very clearly now with these --

582
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,060
阅读的时候戴就可以了
Okay, okay, these are just for reading.

583
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,000
我听不见她唠叨
I won't be able to hear her.

584
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,420
她看不见我的皱纹
She won't be able to see me.

585
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,160
我们会恩爱到永远
We'll be together forever.

586
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,820
恭喜啦
Congratulations.

587
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,190
你正式在"和朋友比拼写"中赢了我
You officially beat me in "Words with friends."

588
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,390
下次好运  孩子
Better luck next time, kid.

589
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,880
我一定得问下  你作弊了吗
Okay, I have to ask -- did you cheat?

590
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,140
你是这样才赢的吗
Is that how you won?

591
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,360
我从来不觉得你是个输不起的人
I never took you for a sore loser.

592
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,540
这不是答案
That's not an answer.

593
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,650
听着  以后你可能是这个家最聪明的人
Listen, one day you might be the smartest person in this family,

594
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,980
但那一天还没有到来
but today is not that day.

595
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,000
所以在你竭力污蔑我的词源学
So tread lightly before you assiduously malign

596
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,690
知识渊博的真实性前  三思而后说  
the veracity of my etymological prowess.

597
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,130
杰・普里契特不玩了
Jay Pritchett out.

598
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,140
你把手机摔坏了  自以为是先生
You broke your phone, smarty-pants.

599
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,100
该死
Damn it!
