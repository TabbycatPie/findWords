1
00:00:01,661 --> 00:00:03,796
嘿 伙计们 马修和莉莉人呢
Hey, guys.Where are Marshall and Lily?

2
00:00:03,798 --> 00:00:05,714
发生了一些很糟糕的事儿
Something terrible happened.

3
00:00:05,716 --> 00:00:07,516
他们俩怎么了 他们是在医院么
Are they okay?Are they in the hospital?

4
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:08,784
不
No.

5
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:12,821
发生了一些比这个糟糕多了的事儿
Somewhere much... much worse.

6
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:14,056
长岛
Long Island!

7
00:00:14,058 --> 00:00:15,557
今晚 我们就要永远搬去长岛了
Tonight, we're moving out there for good.

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,111
哦耶 这是我们新居的备用钥匙
Yeah. Here are your spare keys to our new house.

9
00:00:19,113 --> 00:00:20,512
长岛
Long Island?

10
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:21,897
我不理解
I don't understand.

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,099
你们在这儿也能买到皮肤晒黑喷雾啊
You can get spray tans here.

12
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:25,184
我从来都不敢相信
I never let myself

13
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:27,319
会真有这么一天
believe this day would really come.

14
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:28,570
就好像是 那次我们去看五口之家
It's like when they canceled

15
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:30,856
他们放了两次鸽子
Party of Five for the second time.

16
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:35,844
我的意思是他们还顺带取消了户外运动
I mean when they...canceled sports.

17
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:38,647
亲们 我们还是可以经常见面的啊
Guys, we'll still see each other all the time,

18
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:40,148
而且我们可以煲电话粥啊
and we'll talk on the phone.

19
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,201
再者 即使人们都说有了孩子
And I know people say that having kids means

20
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:43,702
就等于和你的朋友们永别了 但是...
you won't see your friends anymore, but...

21
00:00:43,704 --> 00:00:45,254
哦 老天爷 这就是我们的永别了是么
Oh, God, this is good-bye, isn't it?

22
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:46,622
别 别这样
No. Stop it.

23
00:00:46,624 --> 00:00:47,873
亲们 这不会
Guys, this doesn't

24
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,124
改变任何事情的
change anything.

25
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:52,378
我们只隔了46分钟的火车程而已
We are only a 46-minute train ride away.

26
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,512
只要有空
Just pop out

27
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:54,847
你们可以随时来找我们啊
whenever you want.

28
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:57,716
这么说 我可以坐这儿咯
So... I guess this seat is open.

29
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,937
我还是去拿个椅子吧
I'll go get a chair.

30
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:05,391
好吧 就这样了么
So that's it.

31
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:06,842
不再有马修了
No more Marshall.

32
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:07,893
不再有莉莉了
No more Lily.

33
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:09,511
他们都不在了
They're gone.

34
00:01:09,513 --> 00:01:11,513
这就意味着
Which means...

35
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,182
我们中再也没有那对无聊的
no lame married couple

36
00:01:14,184 --> 00:01:16,902
总是把我的奇思妙想扼杀在摇篮中的小夫妻了
shooting down all my amazing ideas.

37
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:18,987
伙计们 好消息
Guys, great news.

38
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,964
哥是新一届领导人啦
I'm the new leader of the gang!

39
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:24,641
老爸老妈浪漫史

巴尼是小团体的新头头啦

42
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:29,991
HIMYM字幕组倾情奉献

43
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:38,223
马修和莉莉差不多把新居都装点好了
 Marshall and Lily were almost done decorating their new home.

44
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:39,925
-看上去感觉好多了   -是啊
-I like it there much better.   -Yeah.

45
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:41,042
不过还有一个问题
There was only one problem.

46
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:42,594
不对
Wrong!

47
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:45,046
这个不该这么放
This can't go here.

48
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,149
孩子们 当那个原本和莉莉很疏远的父亲
Kids, when he found out she was pregnant,

49
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:48,717
发现女儿怀孕了
Lily's estranged father

50
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,903
出人意料地出现在了他女儿的门前
unexpectedly showed up on her doorstep.

51
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:52,905
这种姿态让莉莉很欣慰
It was a gesture she appreciated.

52
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:55,591
但是两个礼拜后 莉莉和马修已经受够了
But after two weeks,they'd had just about enough.

53
00:01:55,593 --> 00:01:56,942
这个应该放在这儿
That has to go there

54
00:01:56,944 --> 00:01:58,827
来盖住这些开裂的地板
to cover up the splintery floorboard.

55
00:01:58,829 --> 00:01:59,778
而且你们也不该
And you can't hang

56
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,196
把这个照片挂在这儿
this picture here.

57
00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:03,665
这个墙上不是石膏 而是干的牙膏 挂不住的
This isn't plaster;it's dried toothpaste.

58
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,436
伙计们 你们真该为我在这儿而高兴
Guys, you're so lucky I'm here.

59
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:09,121
我就在这屋子里长大
I grew up in this house.

60
00:02:09,123 --> 00:02:11,573
我对这房子了如指掌
I know it like the back of my hand.

61
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:14,293
而且这落地灯也绝对不该竖在这儿
And this lamp absolutely cannot be here.

62
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,044
为什么
Why not?

63
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:18,180
会挡住我看那个小寡妇罗德里格斯
Blocks my view of the Widow Rodriguez

64
00:02:18,182 --> 00:02:20,349
做那些有氧运动的视线的
doing her Jane Fonda workouts.

65
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:22,267
你不觉得她有点老了么 爸
Isn't she a little old, Dad?

66
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,254
哦 你没赶着见到她年轻那会儿
Oh, you didn't see her when I was a kid.

67
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:28,457
在我的脑海里 她永远是54岁
In my mind, she'll always be 54.

68
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:34,279
我能理解他的本意是好的 但是我受不鸟了
I know he means well, but I can't take it anymore.

69
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:36,097
他不会离开的 而且
He won't leave,and-and he's acting

70
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,257
而且就感觉他成了这房子的主人一样 
like this is his house.

71
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:37,933
我懂
No, I know.

72
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:40,452
他还总是给我留这些烦人的纸条
And these annoying notes he keeps leaving around?

73
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:43,155
在我打鼓的时候需要绝对的安静
"I need absolute silence when practicing the drums."

74
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:46,107
别碰那些我放在床头柜里的时尚杂志
"Do not touch the fudge in my nightstand."

75
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:48,794
我们需要在床头柜里弄一些蚂蚁陷阱
"We need ant traps for my nightstand."

76
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,446
我发现我只能藏在这个房间里
I find myself hiding out here

77
00:02:51,448 --> 00:02:53,415
因为这里是唯一一个
just because it's the only room in the house

78
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:54,583
他无法对我们指手画脚的地方
where he can't boss us around.

79
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:55,801
好消息
Great news.

80
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:58,286
我在这些旧的对讲机里装了些新电池
I put new batteries in the old intercom system.

81
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,472
现在我们可以随时的交谈了
Now we can communicate at all times.

82
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,641
完毕
Mickey out.

83
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,011
看看我们的专座都变成什么样子了
Look at what's become of our booth.

84
00:03:06,013 --> 00:03:08,347
就好像我的那个技校老师的手一样
Looks like my old shop teacher's hand--

85
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:10,999
少了点什么
just sort of missing something.

86
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,734
够了
Enough!

87
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:15,153
我受够你们俩怨天尤人
I am sick of you two wallowing in sadness,

88
00:03:15,155 --> 00:03:16,772
而不去做一些积极向上的事儿
instead of doing the healthy thing

89
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:18,574
并假装那些离开你的人
and pretending anyone who leaves you

90
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,026
从来就不存在
never existed in the first place.

91
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:22,494
我不想同意巴尼说的
I hate to agree with Barney's

92
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,645
这些脑残且应该被忽视的话
near-paralyzing abandonment issues,

93
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,030
但是他说到点子上了
but he has a point.

94
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:26,198
你们不能因为两个好朋友搬走了
You can't just stop living

95
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,983
就让生活停滞不前
because two of your friends moved away.

96
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:29,368
就是这样
Precisely.

97
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,730
现在 作为这个团体的新一届领导人
Now, as new group leader,

98
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,205
我提议我们该去做点
I say we go out and do something

99
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,624
以前他们俩在的时候 我们永远做不了的事儿
that we never would have done with Marshall and Lily here.

100
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:37,042
哦
Ooh.

101
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:39,242
还记得我某年某月某日
Remember that amazing idea

102
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:41,880
提出的那个绝妙的想法么
 I had that one time?

103
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:44,666
-我们去脱衣舞俱乐部吧   -没门儿
-Let's go to a strip club.   -Nope.

104
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,635
你们意下如何
So what do you say?

105
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:49,337
来宣告光溜溜的独立吧
Let's declare our independence

106
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:52,941
来个光妞妞的舞怎么样
with an on-da-peen dance.

107
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,395
光光的妞的大腿舞
On-the-peen dance.

108
00:03:56,397 --> 00:03:57,896
行行 我们听见了
No, we got it. We got it.

109
00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:59,180
咱去脱衣舞俱乐部吧
Let's go to a strip club!

110
00:03:59,182 --> 00:04:00,232
额
Well...

111
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,516
不管去哪我都想他们
I'm going to miss them anywhere.

112
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:03,652
借酒浇愁也没用
Might as well see some cans while I'm at it.

113
00:04:03,654 --> 00:04:04,853
这事交给我
I'll take it!

114
00:04:04,855 --> 00:04:06,622
罗宾 凯文 你俩来不
Robin, Kevin, you in?

115
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,491
孩子们 在刚开始谈恋爱的时候
Kids, early in any relationship,

116
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:12,194
有这么一个阶段 你不能拒绝任何事
there's a phase where you don't say no to anything.

117
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:14,930
因为你想让人觉得你有趣
Because you want to seem interesting...

118
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:17,299
爱冒险
adventurous...

119
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:19,051
以及灰常开放
and open-minded.

120
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:21,169
我管这叫恋爱早期胆怯症
I call it Early Relationship Chicken.

121
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,388
唔 姐开放得很
Well, I'm open to anything.

122
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,841
噢 我也是嘿
Oh, mos' def.

123
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:27,709
-那   -那
-So...   -So...

124
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,062
我可不想去脱衣舞俱乐部
I don't want to go to a strip club.

125
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:31,597
我真心不想去脱衣舞俱乐部
I don't want to go to a strip club.

126
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,815
但我也不想让他觉得我太古板了
But I don't want him to think I'm some prude.

127
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:36,935
我去 咱俩已经 那 了好一会了
Man, we've been saying "So" For a while.

128
00:04:36,937 --> 00:04:38,937
-好啊  -好啊
-Yeah!  -Yeah!

129
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:41,440
赞
Yes!

130
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:44,159
今夜将成为传...
Tonight is going to be legen--

131
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,445
等下 去看脱衣舞不太妥当吧
Wait, are we sure it's a good idea to go to a strip club?

132
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:50,332
闭嘴吧 莉莉 现在是我做主...奇
Shut up, Lily! I'm in charge now-- dary!

133
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,669
手机没信号
I've got no cell reception.

134
00:04:53,671 --> 00:04:55,287
我想给泰德打电话
I wanted to call Ted.

135
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:56,371
我感觉太别扭了
This feels weird.

136
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:58,073
上回我离他这么远
The last time I lived this far from him

137
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,124
还是在我做交流生的时候
was my semester abroad.

138
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,126
你没做过交流生啊
You never did a semester abroad.

139
00:05:01,128 --> 00:05:02,577
我们住在学校的两头那会儿
That's what I called it when we lived

140
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,446
就是这么叫的
on opposite sides of campus.

141
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,465
不行
Wrong!

142
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:08,317
别告诉你是要插这个插座吧
Please tell me you're not plugging that in there.

143
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,303
没错 米奇 我正这么打算来着
Yes, Mickey, that's exactly what I'm doing.

144
00:05:11,305 --> 00:05:12,921
成 成 我啥也不说了
All right, fine. I won't say anything.

145
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:15,440
只不过 我从小
It's... just that this was my room

146
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:16,758
就在这屋里长大
when I growing up,

147
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,977
比你多知道那么一点点
so I know it a little better than you.

148
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:21,763
这里好多美好回忆啊
Lot of great memories here.

149
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,483
尤其是发现了自己身体的那些奥秘
Mostly just discovering my body.

150
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,702
够了够了
That's it.

151
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:28,036
米奇 自从你来了
Mickey, since you got here,

152
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:30,322
你就摆出一副固执己见和评判他人的嘴脸
you've been nothing but judgmental and pushy

153
00:05:30,324 --> 00:05:33,075
而且恶心地沉迷在你的青少年性生活里 
and strangely obsessed with your adolescent sex life.

154
00:05:33,077 --> 00:05:34,326
明天早上
Tomorrow morning,

155
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:36,111
你赶紧搬出去
you're out of here.

156

额 我 我只是想帮你们
Well, I-I've just been trying to help you...

我
I...

159
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:46,972
噢 没关系 亲爱的
Oh, it-it's okay, baby.

160
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,807
迟早得这样
It had to be done.

161
00:05:55,165 --> 00:05:56,765
哎呀 好悲桑啊
Too bad the one person

162
00:05:56,767 --> 00:05:58,633
本来有一个人能阻止你搞出这些意外的
who could stop you from making mistakes like that

163
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,502
可惜他下个月就要被赶走了哦 亲
was told he has to move out next month.

164
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:03,338
-明天   -明天
-Tomorrow!   -Tomorrow!

165
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:06,474
要不要给你们跳个舞啊
Would either of you like a dance?

166
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:10,612
我早就准备好了
I'm always ready to rock.

167
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:13,448
时刻准备着
And I'm always ready to roll.

168
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,784
-那   -那
-So...   -So...

169
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:18,003
我可不想要大腿舞
I'm not ready to rock.

170
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:20,172
我会把持不住的
Rolling makes me dizzy.

171
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:23,792
-好啊   -好啊
-Hell, yeah!   -Yeah!

172
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:25,624
我要请客给我男朋友一个大腿舞 
I'm buying my man a lap dance,

173
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,845
因为这就才是我的风格
'cause that's just how I do!

174
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,496
嗨起来吧
Party like a rock star!

175
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:30,615
摇...滚...夜...
Party like a rock star...

It's Ted.

178
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,170
额 你们搬家搬得挺忙吧
Um... you're probably busy with the move still.

179
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:36,438
额
Um...

180
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,391
想扯淡的时候 打给我啊
Give me a call if you want to gab.

181
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:41,727
扯淡这词用的不大好
Sorry about using the word "Gab."

182
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,062
泰德 你就别为马修和莉莉憔悴了
Ted, stop pining over Marshall and Lily.

183
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:45,981
给自己留点尊严成不
Have some self-respect.

184
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,516
喏 把这五块钱叼嘴里
Now, put this fiver in your mouth so...

185
00:06:48,518 --> 00:06:49,756
然后那个长一双勾魂眼的舞娘
that stripper with the lazy eye

186
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:50,518
就会走过把钱拿走
can vacuum it up with...

187
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,737
-巴尼   -啥
-Barney!   -Wh-what?

188
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:53,121
想他们不犯法 好不
I'm allowed to miss them, okay?

189
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,456
他们是我最好的两个朋友
They're my two best friends.

190
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,957
我才是你最好的两个朋友
I'm your two best friends!

191
00:06:56,859 --> 00:06:58,126
咱今天来这里
And we're here tonight

192
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:00,695
就是要证明你根本不用想谁
to show you there's no need to miss something

193
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:03,298
因为你有更好更棒的哦
when you can replace it with something better.

194
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,134
先生们 有请 茉莉！
Gentlemen, say hello to J-J-J-Jasmine!

195
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:19,347
还记得她不
Remember her?

196
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:22,350
之前 我们发现
- So, a while back, we discovered-

197
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:23,851
莉莉有个复刻版
Lily had a doppelganger

198
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:27,388
是个俄罗斯脱衣舞娘
who was a Russian stripper.

199
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,923
看看她吧 泰德
Look at her, Ted.

200
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:30,608
她看起来就像
She's just like old,

201
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,692
人老珠黄的莉莉
less-good Lily,

202
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:33,027
但是绝妙的是 她从不发号施令
but instead of bossing us around,

203
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,278
她袒胸露乳
she shows us her boobs.

204
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,846
手拿开
No touching.

205
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:38,149
额好吧 还是有一点点管东管西
Okay, a little bossing us around.

206
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,151
我叫她升级版莉莉哟
I call her Better Lily.

207
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:43,538
嘿 升级版莉莉 给我的朋友来段大腿舞吧
Hey, Better Lily, please dance for my friend.

208
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,873
巴尼 我真的不需要大腿舞
Barney, I don't need a lap dance.

209
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,326
我得和我的朋友谈谈
I need to talk to my friends.

210
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:50,694
谁说你不能双线操作的
Who says you can't do both?

211
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:52,380
和她唠唠嗑 她又不是没长耳朵
Talk to her. She's got ears.

212
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:54,531
对 她确实听着呢
Yes, she does have ears.

213
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,584
你想摸我的小妞的咪咪吗
You want to touch my girlfriend's boobs?

214
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:58,052
50刀
50 bucks.

215
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:01,722
等下 升级版莉莉正和这头兽人交往么
Wait-- Better Lily is dating this behemoth?

216
00:08:01,724 --> 00:08:03,841
像不像你们认识的一个人
Sound like anyone you know?

217
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:05,542
这是升级版马修
That's New Marshall.

218
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:08,946
新的五人帮达成了
This is our gang now.

219
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,560
喂 筒子们 还是我
Hey, guys, Ted again.

220
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:25,896
有点感觉你们忘了我了
Starting to think you forgot about me.

221
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,999
或者哪个酷酷的邻居替换了我
Or replaced me with some cool neighbor.

222
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,450
他是谁
What's his name?!

223
00:08:29,452 --> 00:08:31,235
开玩笑的
I'm totally kidding.

224
00:08:31,237 --> 00:08:32,787
无论如何 呃
Anyway, uh...

225
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,755
我就是想尽力记住你长啥样而已
just trying to remember what your faces look like.

226
00:08:34,757 --> 00:08:36,674
泰德 当你在一个能有酒喝的脱衣舞俱乐部时
Ted, when they serve alcohol at a strip club,

227
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,376
就不该表现得这么娘娘腔
you're not allowed to show your vagina.

228
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:41,596
给哥100刀 你就无所不见了 我的朋友
100 bucks, and you will see the world, my friend.

229
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:43,881
他们居然不接我电话
They're already ignoring my calls?

230
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,433
看 我是很现实的
Look, I'm realistic.

231
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:48,185
我知道我必须得习惯一个人去看牙医
I knew I'd have to get used to going to the dentist alone,

232
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:50,054
但我不认为他们就真的完全和我绝交了
but I didn't think they'd cut me out completely.

233
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:51,055
要是他们无情
If they don't

234
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,140
休怪我们不义
need us, we don't need them.

235
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:54,942
好样的 你终于看开了
Yes! Finally!

236
00:08:54,944 --> 00:08:57,812
附带一句 你知道她怎么开的酒瓶子吗
By the way, did you see how she opened that bottle?

237
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:01,666
嗷
Whoa.

238
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:04,585
在郊区停电真的 真的好黑啊
Lights out in the suburbs is... is really dark.

239
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,936
保险丝盒在哪里
Where's the fuse box?

240
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:07,238
不晓得
I don't know.

241
00:09:08,157 --> 00:09:10,074
我知道它在哪里哟
I know where it is.

242
00:09:10,076 --> 00:09:12,051
如果我不是忙着打包行李的话 
Maybe I could fix it for you,

243
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,744
或许我可以帮你们修好它哦
if I wasn't so busy packing.

244
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,112
你知道么
You know what?

245
00:09:15,114 --> 00:09:17,114
我敢说这保险丝盒子在地下室
I bet the fuse box is in the basement.

246
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:18,633
我就 我就自己找到它
I'll just... I'll go find it myself.

247
00:09:18,635 --> 00:09:19,967
这能有多纠结
How hard can it be?

248
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:23,387
就像你刚刚撞到桌子角一样纠结哟
As hard as that desk you just walked into?

249
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,592
干得好 米奇 
Good burn, Mickey.

250
00:09:28,594 --> 00:09:31,562
该奖励你一颗床头柜里的小软糖
You deserve a little nightstand fudge for that one.

251
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,963
我眼睛该看哪儿啊
Where do I look?

252
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:34,649
我可不能盯着她胸部
I mean, I can't look at her chest.

253
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,017
我勒个擦 瞄到了
Damn it! I just did.

254
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,818
希望罗宾没注意到
Maybe Robin didn't notice.

255
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,637
哟呵 他还真喜欢那对球啊
Man, he's really up in those jugs.

256
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,990
狠狠地摇啊 宝贝
Shake it, baby!

257
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:44,808
要玩就玩个痛快
A playa's gotta play!

258
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,277
怪怪的
This is weird.

259
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,579
我就看着她的眼睛好了
I'll just look her in the eyes.

260
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:52,333
他是不是爱上这个脱衣舞娘了啊
Is he falling in love with this stripper?

261
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:53,650
赶紧干点儿看上去正常的事儿吧
Quick, do something cool.

262
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,037
干的漂亮 小伙子
Make it rain, son!

263
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,338
钱算个鸟
Money ain't no thang!

264
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,258
我去 里面有一张二十刀啊  
Damn it, there was a 20 in there.

265

你好啊 埃瑞克森先生
Hello, Mr. Eriksen.

266
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:11,602
从风铃声里我听出来
From the sound of the wind chimes,

267
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:13,854
你已经成功抵达一楼了
I hear you've made it to the first floor.

268
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,940
行 我告诉你 米奇
Okay... you know what, Mickey?

269
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:19,643
你那些糟糕的游戏套路可以省省了
You can save the creepy game master routine.

270
00:10:19,645 --> 00:10:22,563
我只是有一丢丢的害怕而已
It's only kind of terrifying me.

271
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:25,032
喔 游戏才刚刚开始而已
Oh, but the game has just begun.

272
00:10:25,034 --> 00:10:27,851
它的名字是 在去地窖换保险丝的路上
I call it "Try Not to Bang into All the Furniture and Stuff

273
00:10:27,853 --> 00:10:32,356
不要碰到那些家具什么的哦 小马修
on Your Way to the Fuse Box in the Basement, Marshall."

274
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:34,625
这只是个暂定名称哟
That's just a working title.

275
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:36,127

Got a little boob glitter on your eyebrow, Mac Daddy.

277

Did I get it?

281
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,206

We got a new gang,

Technically, this song's not over,

289
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:02,052

Where to next?

我们去地下赌场
We go to underground poker game

293

那里是个快废弃的疯人院
in mostly-abandoned insane asylum.

294

别喝了
Let's not drink when we're...

305
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:46,030
我之前看到垃圾桶旁边的抽屉里有盒火柴
I saw a box of matches in the drawer by the trash can.

306
00:11:46,032 --> 00:11:48,232
哦 谢了 宝贝
Okay, thanks, baby.

307
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,374
莉莉 我找不到啊
Lily, I can't find them.

308
00:11:57,376 --> 00:11:59,710
你在找这个吗 
Looking for these?

309
00:12:01,664 --> 00:12:03,464
哦 对了 你看不见我
Oh, right, you can't see me.

310
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:07,384
我正在烧掉你极度渴望的火柴
Um, well, I'm burning the matches you so desperately need.

311
00:12:11,056 --> 00:12:13,274
啊 噢 喔哦
Aah, ooh, ow!

312
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,142
喔哦
Ow.

313
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:16,177
哈哈哈
Hah! Oh!

314
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:20,130
米奇 你猜是谁找到了地下室的楼梯
Mickey... guess who found the basement stairs?

315
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:22,466
用不了多久我就能到达保险盒那里
I'll be down at that fuse box in no time,

316
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:24,801
而当我到达那里
and when I get there,

317
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:27,971
我保证我会弄清保险盒是怎么工作的
I'm sure that I'll figure out how fuse boxes work,

318
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:29,306
然后修好它
so it'll be fine.

319
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:30,658
嘿 马修
Hey, Marshall,

320
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,910
我知道我一直在唬你
I know I've been messing with you,

321
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:35,312
但说真的 第二个台阶 不要
but seriously, that second step, don't...

322
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,414
我不想听 米奇
I don't want to hear it, Mickey.

323
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,420
哦 我的膝盖
Oh, my knee!

324
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:45,372
喔哦
Ow!

325
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:48,592
小心我的架子鼓
And watch out for my drum set.

326
00:12:50,512 --> 00:12:52,179
我又赢了
I win again!

327
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,430
我是虚张声势的
I was bluffing.

328
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:55,316
我甚至牌数都不够
I didn't even have enough cards.

329
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,003
泰德 别再赢了
Ted, please stop winning.

330
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:02,556
嘿 看啊 这就是纽约的摩天大楼
Hey, look, it's the New York City skyline.

331
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:04,558
我们建了 一座筹码之城
We built Chip City

332
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,693
哼 哈
Uh, uh!

333
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:09,029
我们用你们的钱建了一座筹码之城
We built Chip City on all your dough

334
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:11,398
建了一座筹码之城 一起唱
? Built Chip City Hit it!

335
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:19,343
你知道吗 蝴蝶刀
You know Butterfly-knife.

336
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:22,378
我想到纹身脸可能会这么做
I'd expect this from Face Tattoo...

337
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,197
或者刀疤脸
or Cheek Scar,

338
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:26,933
或者拉瑞
or Larry,

339
00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:27,767
但你不行
but not you.

340
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:29,668
为什么我没有绰号
Why don't I get nickname?

341
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,137
因为你有太多特点了 拉瑞
Because you have too many things, Larry.

342
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,355
绰号只能根据一点取
You get one thing!

343
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:41,347
看到了吗 这就是为什么你要带着新马修
See, that's why you bring New Marshall.

344
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:50,356
我们要去屠宰场的派对
We go to party in slaughterhouse.

345
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:51,858
你们来吗
You come?

346
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,293
求你了 上帝 不要啊
Please, God, no.

347
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:59,499
别再让我领导这个小团体了
Don't let me be in charge of the gang anymore.

348
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:01,918
我无法相信凯文大夫在三年前
I can't believe Dr. Kevin doesn't remember me

349
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,387
的治疗之后居然不记得我
from our sessions three years ago.

350
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:05,505
他是那个刺伤
Is that the lunatic

351
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,890
所有狱警的疯子吗
that stabbed all those prison guards?

352
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:10,092
我们一定要去那个派对
We gotta hit that party!

353
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,427
我永远都找不到真爱了
I'll never find love.

354
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:13,712
我们一定要去那个派对
We got to hit that party!

355
00:14:13,714 --> 00:14:15,982
好极了
Sweet.

356
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,851
莉莉
Lily?

357
00:14:18,853 --> 00:14:22,438
我想我们搬到郊外就是个错误
I think we made a mistake moving out to the suburbs.

358
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,407
我想念我们的家了
I miss our home.

359
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:27,360
我想念我们和朋友们的小雅座了
I miss our booth with our friends.

360
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,082
而且我很确定有一根鼓棒插在了
And I'm pretty sure I have a drumstick...

361
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:35,735
某个非常不好的地方
somewhere bad.

362
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:38,070
爸爸 你为什么要这么做
Dad, why are you acting like this?

363
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:40,239
嗯 我本来只是想帮忙的
Well, I was just trying to be helpful,

364
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,625
但你们却希望我在七月四独立日之前搬走
but you guys want me out by the Fourth of July.

365
00:14:42,627 --> 00:14:43,676
是明天
Tomorrow.

366
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:46,512
你知道一个有用的爸爸
You know what a helpful father,

367
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:48,965
更不要说一个爷爷会怎么做吗
not to mention grandfather, might do?

368
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:51,517
把灯打开
Get these lights back on.

369
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:58,558
好了 马修 听好了
Okay, Marshall, listen up.

370
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,643
我会把你指引到保险盒那里
I'm gonna get you to that fuse box.

371
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:03,646
你不能直接下来帮我做吗
Can't you just come down here and do it for me, please?

372
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:05,698
我对这所房子一无所知
I don't know anything about this house.

373
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,899
不 马修
No, Marshall...

374
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:10,152
你对你的房子一无所知
you don't know anything about your house.

375
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:16,609
好了 我们有很多工作要做
All right, we got a lot of work to do.

376
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:19,328
在这等着 我们把你
Wait here, we get you

377
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,614
弄到派对的VPI名单上去
on VPI list for party.

378
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:25,134
你给我们 呃 每人200美元
You give us, uh, $200 per person.

379
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:26,335
服务费
Cover charge.

380
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:28,754
服务费也太高了吧
That's pretty steep for a cover charge.

381
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:30,923
这可是非常好的派对
Is very good party.

382
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:35,828
是纽约扬基和可口可乐的派对
Is party for, uh, New York "Yunkees" And Coca-Cola.

383
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,179
哦 我的天啊
Oh, my God.

384
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,181
可口可乐扬基派对
A Coca-Cola Yankees party?

385
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:41,400
听上去不像骗人的
That sounds like a real thing.

386
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,672
好了 现在 马修 向前走三步
Okay, now, Marshall, take three steps forward,

387
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:49,775
同时俯身躲避天花板上坏了的风扇
while ducking underneath the broken ceiling fan.

388
00:15:50,911 --> 00:15:52,011
现在面向你的左面
Now look to your left

389
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:54,030
吐口水
and spit.

390
00:15:55,533 --> 00:15:56,666
那是加热器
That's the water heater.

391
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,117
离它远点
Want to stay away from that.

392
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,245
那个小宝贝可比穿着紧身衣的
That baby is hotter than

393
00:16:00,246 --> 00:16:02,371
罗德里格斯家的寡妇还要火热
the Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.

394
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:05,193
好了 现在 通过洗衣机和烘干机
Okay, now past the washer and dryer

395
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:06,509
是最难的部分了
is the hardest part.

396
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:09,845
你必须从乒乓球桌下面匍匐爬过去
You're gonna have to belly-crawl underneath the ping-pong table

397
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:11,764
小心不要碰到它
and don't so much as nudge it.

398
00:16:11,766 --> 00:16:12,848
为什么不能碰
Why not?

399
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:15,685
因为有900快多米诺骨牌摆成了
Because there are 900 dominos set up

400
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:17,520
芭芭拉 伊登的形状
in the shape of Barbara Eden.

401
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:20,139
我是太空仙女恋的超级超级粉丝
Big, big I Dream Of Jeannie fan.

402
00:16:24,194 --> 00:16:25,144
完成了
I'm clear.

403
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:33,235
我不知道这是什么声音 米奇
I don't know what that sound is, Mickey.

404
00:16:33,237 --> 00:16:35,354
那是芭芭拉 伊登永远不会和我上床的声音
That's the sound of Barbara Eden never banging me.

405
00:16:35,356 --> 00:16:36,405
这就是那个声音
That's what that is.

406
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:38,324
爸爸 把它打开
Dad, get it back.

407
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:41,460
求你了
Come on.

408
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:44,046
好吧 马修
Okay, Marshall,

409
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,748
往前三步
take three steps forward,

410
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,167
你就到了保险盒
and you should be at the fuse box.

411
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,336
你觉得他成功了么
Do you think he made it?

412
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:55,558
我做到了
I did it!

413
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,009
不 马修
No, Marshall...

414
00:16:57,011 --> 00:16:59,228
你们做到了
you did it.

415
00:17:01,682 --> 00:17:03,683
有意思的是 受那个晚上的启发
fun fact,that night inspired

416
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:05,851
米奇开发了唯一一款成功的桌游
Mickey's one and only successful board game--

417
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:09,689
这里有破裂的地板与生锈的铁钉
 With splintery floorboards and rusty nails

418
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:14,193
小心别被刺穿
? Make sure you don't get impaled ?

419
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:15,461
停电大冒险
? Lites Out!

420
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:18,364
奥德林游戏出品
Brought to you by Aldrin Games!

421
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:20,700
恩 从那个妓女服务过的对象
Well, judging from how many clients

422
00:17:20,702 --> 00:17:22,568
的数量来看
that hooker has serviced,

423
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:24,170
我想说我们来这已经快一个小时了
I'd say we've been here almost an hour.

424
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:26,288
泰德 我们被抢劫了
Ted, we've been robbed.

425
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,408
升级版莉莉和新版马修不可能打劫我们
Better Lily and New Marshall would never rob us.

426
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,327
他俩是我们最好的朋友
They're our best friends.

427
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,327
大家淡定 哥待会要去打劫这些二货们

428
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,417
该死 泰德
Damn it, Ted.

429
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:40,886
新版马修是一只动物园跑路熊
New Marshall is an escaped zoo bear

430
00:17:40,888 --> 00:17:44,190
那个升级版莉莉唯一的优点 就是比莉莉
and the only thing that Better Lily is better at than our Lily

431
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:45,891
的手工活更好些（邪恶的小巴..）
is over-the-pants hand stuff.

432
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:48,260
哥猜的
I'm assuming.

433
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:49,445
哥得承认
I'll admit it.

434
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:50,946
哥不能继续领导这个组了
I can't lead this group.

435
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:52,732
我们需要马修和莉莉
We need Marshall and Lily.

436
00:17:52,734 --> 00:17:54,600
他们不是走了么
But they're gone, aren't they?

437
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:57,069
我的意思是 一开始是一周小聚几次
I mean, it'll go from seeing them a couple times a week,

438
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:58,871
然后一月小聚几次
to a couple times a month,

439
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:01,207
最后就只有假期派对才能见面了
and then it'll just be holiday parties.

440
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:04,076
时过境迁
Then the years pass,

441
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:05,745
然后你发现马修已经翘辫子了
and you find out Marshall's dead,

442
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:08,297
然后你起初只是作为莉莉的情感寄托
and you're there for Lily emotionally at first,

443
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:11,617
却发展成肉体关系 然后你产生了内疚感
but then it becomes sexual, and you feel guilty,

444
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:14,587
不过有可能那会让这段关系变得更淫荡和美妙
but maybe that guilt just makes it dirtier and better...

445
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:15,954
不 我不会让那发生的
No, I won't let that happen.

446
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:17,506
特别是最后那部分
Especially that last part.

447
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:21,126
听着 我知道我今夜是有点小醉和天真
Look, I know I've been a little drunk and naive tonight,

448
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:22,178
不过接下来要听我的
but here's what's gonna happen.

449
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,512
首先 我们留下一张纸条
First, we're gonna leave a note

450
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:25,564
给升级版莉莉和大块头 以防他们担心
for Better Lily and Arvydas, they're worriers.

451
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,016
然后
Oh, buddy. Then,

452
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,769
我们去拜访仅此一家的马修和别无分店的莉莉
we're gonna go see Only Marshall and One-Of-A-Kind Lily

453
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:31,136
因为他们是我们最好的朋友
because they're our best friends

454
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:32,471
而且我们离他们只有四十六分钟的路程
and they're only 46 minutes away.

455
00:18:32,473 --> 00:18:33,739
你们同意么
Are you with me?
