1
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:11,281
Hey, how'd it go with the lawyer?

2
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,026
Yeah, pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:14,923
Um, state's attorney is moving forward

4
00:00:14,923 --> 00:00:16,283
on the obstruction charges.

5
00:00:16,283 --> 00:00:17,731
There's no trial date set or anything,

6
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,731
but the lawyer thinks it'll
happen sometime next year.

7
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:22,969
Then don't do anything
stupid between now and then.

8
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:24,969
I'll do my best.

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,290
Hey, listen, I wanted to
talk to you about something,

10
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:29,942
- Huh?
- Um...

11
00:00:33,852 --> 00:00:36,853
Can a cop choose to be
in general population?

12
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:41,812
I mean, if I lose, I don't know--

13
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:44,461
I don't know how well I'll do

14
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:46,896
23 hours a day alone in my cell.

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,867
- Uh, well, we'll talk about
that down the road

16
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:52,469
if we need to.

17
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:01,439
- Yeah, um, is Kev all right?

18
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:02,812
I've been reaching out to him,

19
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,148
and, uh, he's gone silent on me.

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,920
- Yeah, he's working a case.

21
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,220
- All right.
All right, thanks, boss.

22
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:12,455
- Yeah.

23
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:17,060
- I don't think women
understand how hard it is

24
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:18,394
to be a man these days.

25
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:19,896
Think about it, bro.

26
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:21,598
We've got to be
the bread-winning alpha dogs,

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,666
we've got to be strong, but we
also got to be sensitive.

28
00:01:23,668 --> 00:01:24,801
- Right.
- Right?

29
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:26,069
- Mm-hmm.
- Understanding.

30
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,737
Pretend like we want to change the world.

31
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:28,841
That's a paradox, Peanut.

32
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:30,075
- See, there you go again

33
00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:32,006
trying to show off
with all them big words.

34
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,086
- Come on, man,
all I'm trying to say is--

35
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:34,406
- Contradictory.

36
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:37,266
I know, but trust me,

37
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,124
no woman is asking you to save the world,

38
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,150
and no good one is asking you
to pay her bills.

39
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:44,509
Look, just end of the day,
it's simple, okay?

40
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:46,233
We're just asking you to be nice.

41
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,025
Girl got a good point.

42
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,584
Ain't nothing paradoxical
about that neither.

43
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,197
- We is gonna find you a book.
- Man, shut up.

44
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,677
- You're always clowning.

45
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:58,067
No wonder you two fools are broke.

46
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:02,639
Oh, so you're planning
what exactly, Kevin?

47
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:04,274
- Don't worry about all that,
Dre.

48
00:02:04,276 --> 00:02:06,188
- It's Andre.

49
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:09,279
Don't worry about all that, Andre.

50
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:11,781
Just know I'm working off
of big things, bro.

51
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:14,120
- Big things?
- Atwater's losing his touch.

52
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:16,288
It's been two weeks and Andre
still can't stand him.

53
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,623
- Andre needs
a new line of work

54
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,725
'cause that dude is always moody.

55
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:22,169
- Working for Darius Walker
will do that to you.

56
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:23,249
- I told you, man.

57
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,497
His mother and my mother grew
up next door to each other.

58
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:28,000
Now that's family, bro.

59
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:33,072
D, you good?

60
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,147
Man, Darius got that look.

61
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,716
What look is that?

62
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:46,049
One that says stay the hell away.

63
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:47,820
- Nina.

64
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:56,738
- Yo, what happened?

65
00:02:58,332 --> 00:02:59,625
- Smokey's gone.

66
00:03:00,742 --> 00:03:02,536
- What you mean?
- He's dead.

67
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:05,671
Someone shot him, man.

68
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:08,500
Took his buy money too. 20 grand.

69
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:11,377
- You think Garcia--
- I don't know.

70
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:16,248
You know anything about this?

71
00:03:18,525 --> 00:03:19,645
Excuse me?

72
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:20,949
You've been hanging around the bar,

73
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,354
you've been asking
a whole bunch of questions,

74
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:24,256
then one of our own
gets robbed and killed.

75
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:26,925
Andre, you don't got to like me, bro,

76
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:28,894
but what you ain't gonna do
is accuse me of anything.

77
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,893
Kev, you've got to be careful, bro.

78
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:32,137
Careful about what?

79
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,532
I ain't seen your ass in ten years,

80
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:35,367
then you just show up,
trying to reconnect?

81
00:03:35,369 --> 00:03:36,969
Peanut, hell are you talking about--

82
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:38,737
I know you did your time in Stateville,

83
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:40,706
but maybe they let you out early.

84
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,541
Maybe you told them you had
a friend named Peanut.

85
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:43,742
You done lost your damn mind, man.

86
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:46,312
- Peanut pulled a gun.
- Hold it, hold on.

87
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:47,647
Let it play out.

88
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:52,084
Peanut, I understand
that you wanna show out

89
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,285
in front of your boy,

90
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:54,815
but if you're gonna pull that thing out,

91
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,008
you're gonna have to stop
talking and start shooting.

92
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:01,393
Don't push it, bro.

93
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:35,427
You're gonna follow me, bro?

94
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:37,096
- You damn right I am.

95
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:42,803
- You did good, boy.

96
00:04:44,012 --> 00:04:46,872
- Bro, I ain't had no choice.
Andre wasn't playing around.

97
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:48,941
He don't trust your ass.
- It's all good, bro.

98
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:50,109
We breaking them down.

99
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:52,344
- Happy to help as long as you
don't write no paper on me.

100
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,712
- What did I tell you
when I arrested you?

101
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,781
You do me right, I'll do you better.

102
00:04:55,783 --> 00:04:57,950
- Right on, bro.
- I'll holler at you.

103
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:01,220
- Hey, yo, next time,
just grab the gun.

104
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:03,055
There no need for you to hit me, bro.

105
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:05,290
- I hear you, dawg.

106
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:11,716
Chicago PD
<i><font color="#ffff00">S07E02- Assets</font></i>

107
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,797
- Talked to Homicide about
the Smokey thing.

108
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:13,565
Turns out he's a high ranking guy

109
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:15,801
in Darius Walker's organization.

110
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:18,404
- Any suspects?
- Nothing real yet.

111
00:05:18,406 --> 00:05:20,406
All we know is two male Latinos
were spotted near

112
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:22,307
the crime scene a few minutes
after it happened.

113
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:24,743
- Smokey had 20 grand on him,
which means he knew the sellers.

114
00:05:24,745 --> 00:05:26,311
He probably did business
with them before.

115
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:28,414
Otherwise he wouldn't have
had that much money on him.

116
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,559
- So it's an inside job.

117
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:33,201
Seller steals the cash,
keeps the product.

118
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:34,920
Wouldn't be the first time
we've seen that happen.

119
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:36,555
- No, but it's the first time
it's happened

120
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:38,157
to somebody working for Darius Walker.

121
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,560
- Well, the good news is it
does open up an angle for us.

122
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:43,495
Look, if we know the
Latin Players were behind this,

123
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:45,831
you can be damn sure
Darius Walker knows too.

124
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:49,168
That means he's going to be
looking for a new supplier.

125
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,804
Jay, I want you to go under
as that supplier.

126
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:54,061
- Sounds good.

127
00:05:54,086 --> 00:05:56,186
Hey, Sarge?
- Hmm?

128
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,913
- So all that stuff last week?
We're good?

129
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:04,749
- We are where we are.
Let's move on.

130
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,393
- Man, this place is slammed.

131
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:15,060
I should've been selling baked goods.

132
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,076
- Right? And it's less
risky

133
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:19,198
'cause I don't know a brother who ever
got popped for moving scones.

134
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,401
- Yeah, this place does
$800,000 a year in revenue.

135
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:24,069
The one on Ashland does 1.2.

136
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,438
- Damn, we are
in the wrong business.

137
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:31,376
- Oh, the big boss.
What's he doing in here?

138
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:32,578
He got a sweet tooth?

139
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,080
- Yeah, for money.

140
00:06:35,082 --> 00:06:36,482
He owns the joint.

141
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:38,217
He owns the whole damn chain.

142
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:40,652
- Really?
- Yeah.

143
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:42,254
- He gave two smart,
young brothers

144
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,490
300 grand to start this whole place up.

145
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:45,891
All legit.

146
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:47,759
- It's a good way
to clean your cash too.

147
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:49,728
- Nah, it's more than that.

148
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,463
See, Darius wants to change things.

149
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:53,599
Educate young black folks
to think and act

150
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,635
like those dudes up in Silicon Valley.

151
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:58,070
- Well,
I'm all about business too.

152
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,440
I sell premium product at a fair price.

153
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,441
- Where does your product
come from?

154
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:04,977
- Juarez.
I got a cousin down there.

155
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:06,363
- Cousin?

156
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:11,149
Bro, your cousins are
from Cape Cod or Lake Forest,

157
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:12,618
not no Juarez.

158
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,047
- I was born and raised
in Pilsen,

159
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:15,254
but, uh, been in the game
for a long time,

160
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:17,155
and I got a lot of connections in Juarez.

161
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:20,959
- Okay, well, I'm gonna have
to run this up the chain.

162
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,461
- Naturally.

163
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:24,256
- I appreciate the opportunity,
Andre.

164
00:07:25,366 --> 00:07:26,832
- All right.
- See you later?

165
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:28,760
- Yeah, man.
Later.

166
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:33,372
Darius is giving these donuts away

167
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:34,606
to clean off his dirty-ass drug money.

168
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:36,842
That's it, that's all.

169
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:38,877
- What, you don't buy
the Robin Hood rap?

170
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,445
- Not so much sold
on this selfless,

171
00:07:40,447 --> 00:07:42,648
black empowerment thing.

172
00:07:42,983 --> 00:07:44,383
It's hypocrites like that
that are the reason why

173
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,987
I can't wake up with my brother
and sister every morning.

174
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,965
- What can I do for you,
Detective?

175
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:02,334
- Just wanted to follow up
on a few things

176
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:04,754
regarding the Adam Ruzek case.

177
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,473
- Well, I'm not talking without
my FOP lawyer present.

178
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:09,808
- It's not a big deal.

179
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,010
I just need to clarify a few statements.

180
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:21,053
- Okay, I'll schedule a meeting
with your FOP lawyer

181
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,588
if that's what you want.

182
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,156
- I'll tell you what I want.

183
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:28,594
I want this case to go away.

184
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,062
- Excuse me?

185
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:31,763
- And you and I both know
the only reason

186
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:33,432
you opened this case

187
00:08:33,434 --> 00:08:35,000
is 'cause Kelton squeezed you.

188
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:39,497
He wanted me, so he told you
to go after Ruzek and Antonio.

189
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:42,240
Yeah.

190
00:08:42,242 --> 00:08:44,085
I mean, Kelton's dead.

191
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,778
Why are we wasting our time on this?

192
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,848
You wanna know the truth?

193
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,720
I don't care about this case,
but the ship has sailed, Hank.

194
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,388
It's with the state's
attorney's office now.

195
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,791
- All right, you know the ASA?
- Yes, of course.

196
00:08:59,793 --> 00:09:02,312
- Maybe you take
his temperature.

197
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:06,264
Why don't you see
how invested he really is

198
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,933
in prosecuting a good cop

199
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:11,403
over the accidental death
of a rapist/kidnapper?

200
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,741
- I could do that.

201
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:19,788
- Even if Adam did do
what you say he did,

202
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:22,114
you know the only thing he's guilty of

203
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:25,550
is being a good partner
and a loyal friend.

204
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:30,261
- I'll see what I can do.

205
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,330
- Andre tells me
you've got a friend

206
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,432
who's got a cousin in Juarez.

207
00:09:40,434 --> 00:09:41,767
- Yeah, my homie Jay.

208
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,602
We used to hoop together in high school.

209
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:45,303
- Well, what's your take?

210
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:47,039
- 10% the first time.

211
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:51,076
- Outside of introducing people

212
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,246
to your friend who's
got a cousin in Juarez,

213
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:57,783
what are your professional aspirations?

214
00:09:57,785 --> 00:09:59,451
- At the moment,
I'm just waiting for the state

215
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:00,752
to give me my license back

216
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:02,789
so I can start a construction job.

217
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:06,459
- Okay.

218
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:11,363
How do you and Peanut know each other?

219
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:13,532
- We grew up on the same block.
Mom's were real tight.

220
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:14,933
- What block?

221
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:16,702
- 47th and Calumet
in Bronzeville.

222
00:10:16,704 --> 00:10:17,969
- Hey now, that's a real

223
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,038
African American neighborhood
right there.

224
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,773
Louis Armstrong grew up there.

225
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:23,208
- Yeah, I know.

226
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,111
Now there's a Starbucks on every block.

227
00:10:26,113 --> 00:10:27,612
- You think that's a bad thing?

228
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:31,192
Come in.

229
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:35,320
- What's up?
You wanted to see me?

230
00:10:36,857 --> 00:10:39,291
- I hear you're moving product
near a grade school.

231
00:10:39,293 --> 00:10:40,459
Is that true?

232
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:41,993
- Man, who said that?

233
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:57,976
- I'm giving you
an opportunity

234
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:00,178
to be accountable here, Bryce.

235
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:05,851
Did you sell dope in front
of Clara Barton?

236
00:11:09,223 --> 00:11:11,583
- Yeah, I did.

237
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,433
- You know that's against
the rules, right?

238
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:22,901
- I know.

239
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,287
I...

240
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:26,738
I'm sorry, Darius.

241
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,673
I just...

242
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:30,609
I...

243
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:35,447
- School needs
a baseball coach.

244
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:37,316
Be there tomorrow at 4:00.

245
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:42,387
You're done selling dope.

246
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:47,425
Get out.

247
00:12:05,712 --> 00:12:07,746
- Your goldfish die
or something?

248
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,001
- Nah, I'm just deep
in thought.

249
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,838
- About what?

250
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:17,989
- Business.

251
00:12:18,508 --> 00:12:20,225
- What kind of business?

252
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:23,395
Wait, don't tell me.
I don't even want to know.

253
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:25,223
Buy you a drink?

254
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:29,501
- No, I got to go.

255
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:30,902
Rain check?

256
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:33,905
- I don't do rain checks,
sweetie,

257
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:35,974
especially on a sunny day.

258
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:38,243
- But you know how
that Chicago weather is.

259
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:48,620
Just talked to Andre.
Walker's not doing the deal with you.

260
00:12:48,622 --> 00:12:50,945
- I'm offended.
- Well, he wasn't feeling it.

261
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:52,238
- Does he have
another dealer lined up

262
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,959
or is he still doing business
with the Latin Players?

263
00:12:53,961 --> 00:12:55,594
- I don't know.
Walker doesn't talk about it.

264
00:12:55,596 --> 00:12:58,296
- Units in the 7th District
and units on the citywide,

265
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:00,265
we're getting multiple calls
of shots fired

266
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:02,408
at 1221 South 58th Street.

267
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,546
- That's like
three blocks away.

268
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:05,003
- Let's roll.
- All right, stay here.

269
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:07,015
Don't blow your cover.
- All right.

270
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:23,187
- To your right.

271
00:13:26,034 --> 00:13:28,660
- Bodies.
- Go, I got you.

272
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:30,395
- Two of them.

273
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,332
Looks like they're both gone.

274
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,980
- Don't come any closer!
- Police! Put it down!

275
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:50,503
- We're the police!
- How do I know?

276
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:51,750
- You see this?
This says we're the police.

277
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:52,918
Put your gun down!

278
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,237
- How do I know
you won't kill me?

279
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:56,721
- Because if we wanted you
dead, you'd already be dead.

280
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:57,989
You need to put your gun down now.

281
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:00,492
We will shoot.
You're not giving us a choice.

282
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:01,731
Put your gun down now!

283
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,428
- Oh, God!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

284
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,897
I'm sorry, I thought
you were trying to kill me.

285
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,867
I'm sorry.
- Safety was on.

286
00:14:17,036 --> 00:14:19,420
- Our two vics are Luis Tores
and Benji Rodriguez.

287
00:14:19,422 --> 00:14:22,651
Our girl is Gloria Romero,
she's Benji's girlfriend.

288
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:23,675
Took some persuading,

289
00:14:23,677 --> 00:14:25,810
but she's confirmed that
they're Latin Players.

290
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,004
- She see anything?

291
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:28,924
- No, she said she was hanging
out with her friends.

292
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:30,659
She went on a cigarette run,
she came back,

293
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,095
she heard the shots, so she ran and hid.

294
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:34,763
She said she heard a male voice say,

295
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:35,931
"This is for Smokey."

296
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:38,500
- All right, so Darius is
looking at revenge for Smokey.

297
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,602
Is that what we're thinking?
- Makes sense.

298
00:14:40,604 --> 00:14:42,857
You kill one of mine,
I kill two of yours.

299
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:45,373
- All right, well,
somebody had to see something.

300
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,942
The shooter didn't
just fall from the sky.

301
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:48,376
Let's dig in.

302
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,782
Find witnesses, surveillance cameras.

303
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,949
- Sergeant?
- Sir?

304
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,051
- Is it true
their throats were slit?

305
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:57,819
Darius Walker's crew?

306
00:14:57,821 --> 00:14:59,554
- Yeah, it sure seems that way.

307
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:01,456
- You know, a gang war
is not exactly an ideal way

308
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,459
to kick off one's tenure
as Interim Superintendent.

309
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,696
- Especially if you want that
interim tag removed one day.

310
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,665
- I just want to do what's best
for the people of this city.

311
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,387
- Enough said.

312
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,903
- Keep me posted, Sergeant.

313
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:26,515
- I was just trying to help.
- I know.

314
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:27,983
- He's out here selling product

315
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,885
in front of children and parents.

316
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,322
You know?

317
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:34,322
It's why I restrained him,
I called patrol.

318
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,057
- You punched him in the face
and threw him on the ground.

319
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,592
- Hold on,
he swung at me first.

320
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,261
- You're off the job, Adam.

321
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,829
You don't have the authority.

322
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,832
- Sarge, I mean,
he's out here

323
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:45,534
just slinging crack
in the broad daylight.

324
00:15:45,536 --> 00:15:46,735
- It doesn't matter.

325
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,003
- What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

326
00:15:48,005 --> 00:15:49,070
Of course it matters.

327
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,439
- You can't get involved
in things like this, Adam.

328
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,208
Not anymore, not until
your stuff gets resolved.

329
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,943
- I was just trying to help.

330
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,678
I mean...

331
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,916
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

332
00:16:02,686 --> 00:16:04,147
I'm fine.

333
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,025
- Okay.

334
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,360
Come on.

335
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:12,460
- How did it go out there?
- Pretty damn good.

336
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,895
I found a witness who lives nearby.

337
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:14,963
She saw a young black male.

338
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:17,265
Skinny, 5'10, running
from the back of the building,

339
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,767
and she said she'll do an ID

340
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,302
once we have an offender in custody.

341
00:16:20,304 --> 00:16:21,703
- Okay, good.
What about you two?

342
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:22,804
- Well, we got some video.

343
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:24,873
Uh, this is from an
auto part shop down the street

344
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,107
from the abandoned building.

345
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:28,310
We got a blue Ford Taurus, pulls up.

346
00:16:28,312 --> 00:16:29,911
It's got a--a dent in the side panel.

347
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:31,746
Now it idles in front of the building,

348
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:33,148
and then the shots go off at 3:29.

349
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,416
It just takes off.

350
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:35,884
- All right,
did you run that plate?

351
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:37,052
- Yeah, it's a dummy.
It came back empty.

352
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:39,321
- So if the car was idling
when the shots were fired...

353
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:40,822
- It means the driver's
not the shooter.

354
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:41,923
- Could be the getaway driver.

355
00:16:41,925 --> 00:16:44,159
- All right, so let's find
that blue Taurus, fast.

356
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:45,994
Talk to Kevin. Get him up to speed.

357
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:47,229
- Hank?
- Yeah.

358
00:16:47,231 --> 00:16:49,464
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, what's up?

359
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,137
- I just talked to Adam,
and I'm worried.

360
00:16:58,008 --> 00:17:00,842
- I'm working on it.
- Work harder.

361
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,346
As tough as he is,

362
00:17:04,348 --> 00:17:07,082
he is not gonna last a month
on the inside.

363
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,325
- Listen, if you're telling me
there's nothing

364
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,427
you need me to do, I'll leave it alone.

365
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:20,996
But dawg, if there's something I can do

366
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,130
to keep this deal back on track--

367
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:23,935
- Bro, it's dead.

368
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:26,268
Just leave it alone.

369
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,803
- Okay, I'm just making sure.

370
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,483
Who's the kid?

371
00:17:31,608 --> 00:17:34,943
- Name's Jerald.
Darius helps him out.

372
00:17:34,945 --> 00:17:36,645
- Okay.

373
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,680
Pretty sure Jerald helps out Darius too.

374
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,842
Ain't nothing for free.
- That don't concern you, bro.

375
00:17:40,844 --> 00:17:42,517
- What you mean it don't?

376
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,619
Come on, man, I'm trying
to do business with y'all.

377
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:46,788
Obviously, he prefers working
with fifth graders.

378
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:54,029
- Yeah, he just left the bar.
We'll track him.

379
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:04,039
- So how long we got
to do this, man?

380
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,308
- Until I say stop.

381
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,710
- No, no, this ain't right,
and you ain't my boss.

382
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,178
- Not here, man.
What are you--

383
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,346
- I'm sick of all
this damn lying.

384
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:13,648
- You're gonna be sick of being
dead if you don't shut up.

385
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:17,238
You're doing this
until the job is done, Peanut.

386
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:19,821
Okay?
- All right, yeah, it's my bad.

387
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,824
- Is it mine?

388
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:54,363
- The more we dig into
our bartender, Nina Rodriguez,

389
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:55,705
the less we know.

390
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,231
Plates are fictitious, no DL,
no criminal info.

391
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,766
- We know she rented
a studio apartment

392
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:01,367
three months ago,
and is paying cash for it.

393
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:03,269
- So it could be tips.
It could also be drug money.

394
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:04,370
- Well, what do you think, Kev?

395
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:06,606
Is she part of Walker's drug crew?

396
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:08,374
- I'm not sure,
but it's possible.

397
00:19:08,376 --> 00:19:09,509
- The real question is,
is she the shooter,

398
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:13,279
the getaway driver, or is
someone just using her car?

399
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:15,048
- Hey.
Let's find out.

400
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,015
Put some pressure on her.

401
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:18,551
See if you can catch
her dirty in a drug deal,

402
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,420
Get her to flip on Walker.

403
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:22,922
You talked to the ASA?

404
00:19:22,924 --> 00:19:24,857
- Yeah.
Got a second?

405
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:25,892
- Come on.

406
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:31,851
All right, I talked to Heller.
He worked a little magic.

407
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:35,401
Prosecutor is willing to cut you a deal.

408
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:38,900
12 months, you do six.

409
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:41,774
- If I roll the dice at trial?

410
00:19:42,544 --> 00:19:44,377
- You lose, you're looking at
three to five.

411
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:48,881
- Well, maybe I'll win?

412
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,550
Lawyer says it's 50-50.

413
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:54,253
- Yeah, well, your lawyer
doesn't have to do the time

414
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:55,721
if he's wrong.

415
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:57,293
- Yeah, but...

416
00:19:58,126 --> 00:19:59,425
what happens when I'm out?

417
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:05,218
My career's over,
I've got to find a new job?

418
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:07,733
All I know is being in the police, Sarge.

419
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:09,902
It's who I am. It's, like, all I got.

420
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:17,443
- Then we fight it.

421
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:28,154
- Look at you.

422
00:20:28,156 --> 00:20:29,922
Just the person I wanted to see.

423
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:32,125
I've got a little opportunity for you.

424
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,359
- Yeah, what kind
of an opportunity?

425
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:34,594
- The kind that gets you more

426
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:36,499
of those gold necklaces you like.

427
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,199
One of my guys sells premium H,

428
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:43,536
and he's gonna give me 10%
of everything I bring in.

429
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:46,038
I figure with your line of work
and place of business,

430
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,774
you might know some people
other than Darius.

431
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:50,576
I took a run at him. He ain't going.

432
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:54,433
- What's my end?

433
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,450
- 5%.

434
00:20:57,452 --> 00:20:59,118
- And what kind of weight
are we talking about?

435
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,454
- I'm talking about four bricks
at a time at 50 a pop.

436
00:21:01,456 --> 00:21:02,822
You smack them with a five-stack tax

437
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:05,158
on your back end that's 20 grand total.

438
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,613
10,000 apiece, me and you.

439
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:09,629
- Man, you sure
know your stuff.

440
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:12,031
- Well, I'm trying
to make this money, Nina.

441
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,786
You down or not?

442
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:17,136
- I'll make some calls.
Mm-hmm?

443
00:21:17,138 --> 00:21:18,666
- Let me holla at you.

444
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:28,681
- What up, what up?
- Sup?

445
00:21:28,683 --> 00:21:30,816
This is my boy, Trey.
- What's up, Trey?

446
00:21:30,818 --> 00:21:32,418
- Nothing much.

447
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,587
I understand y'all got
some candy you want to shift.

448
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:35,821
- How much can you handle?

449
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:38,090
- Two pieces of taffy.
Maybe three.

450
00:21:38,092 --> 00:21:39,759
Nina say you got some pure stuff.

451
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:40,816
- Mm-hmm.

452
00:21:40,818 --> 00:21:42,261
- You tight south
of the border?

453
00:21:42,263 --> 00:21:43,608
- Juarez.

454
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:46,699
- How about 100 for three?

455
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:48,234
- I thought you said
this guy was serious.

456
00:21:48,236 --> 00:21:49,569
- And I thought
I said 50 a pop.

457
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:51,237
- All right, how about this?

458
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:53,039
My boy gives you 100 grand right now.

459
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:54,574
Okay, that's for two.

460
00:21:54,576 --> 00:21:57,376
You front him the other brick,
for trust and all.

461
00:21:57,378 --> 00:21:59,545
If the product's as good
as you say it is,

462
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:01,447
I mean, we're in business
for a long time.

463
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:04,837
- Makes sense.

464
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:08,888
- All right.
Where and when?

465
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,891
We're on the move for the dope.

466
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:18,531
- Copy that.

467
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:22,134
You're covered in back. Hailey, you set?

468
00:22:22,777 --> 00:22:24,370
- Yup, set.

469
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,946
- You wanna test it?
- Nah.

470
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:37,049
You say it's pure. It's pure.

471
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:38,918
It's about trust, right?

472
00:22:46,661 --> 00:22:48,837
- Oh, they're coming.
Kim.

473
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:04,230
Oh, these two don't look like altar boys.

474
00:23:05,314 --> 00:23:07,747
Jay, we got two bogeys
maybe coming your way.

475
00:23:07,749 --> 00:23:11,911
Sarge, you get that?
- Yeah, keep an eye.

476
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:14,887
Jay, stay focused.

477
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,157
- What's wrong?

478
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,259
What's wrong is I don't see any money.

479
00:23:20,261 --> 00:23:22,164
- Calm down, bro.

480
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:24,630
I've got it right here.

481
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:27,867
- Gun!

482
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:30,770
- Jay, two armed offenders
coming your way!

483
00:23:30,772 --> 00:23:32,972
- Hands up! Chicago PD!
Put your guns down!

484
00:23:32,974 --> 00:23:33,873
- Police!

485
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,808
- Put your hands down!
Hey!

486
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,377
- Get down!
- Get down!

487
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:39,712
- Put it down!
- Put your hands up!

488
00:23:39,714 --> 00:23:41,347
- Hands up now!
- I'm a cop!

489
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:42,815
- We're cops, not--

490
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:45,618
- Drop your weapon!
- We're police!

491
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,819
- Hey, everybody shut up!
Shut up!

492
00:23:46,821 --> 00:23:48,354
- Chill!
Just chill!

493
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:49,855
I'm a cop!

494
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:51,791
- Let me see some ID
and badges.

495
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:53,059
My button's in my pocket.

496
00:23:53,061 --> 00:23:55,361
I'm Raul Acosta, assigned to Squad E66,

497
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:57,229
long-term investigations.

498
00:23:57,231 --> 00:23:59,131
My Commander is Marty Belmont.

499
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,399
- It's legit.

500
00:24:02,136 --> 00:24:03,669
- Lower your weapon.

501
00:24:19,622 --> 00:24:21,092
- Thank God it's not like
the old days.

502
00:24:21,094 --> 00:24:22,639
Shoot first, ask later.

503
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:24,082
- How long you've been working
these guys?

504
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:26,374
- We've been up on Walker
for about three months now.

505
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:27,775
- You have anymore
undercovers working?

506
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:29,310
- Just our rookie.

507
00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:30,845
- They plucked me straight out
of the Academy.

508
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:34,349
- Who's they?
- OCD Deputy Chief Morales.

509
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:36,384
Didn't think he knew I existed.
- Wait, hold up.

510
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:38,219
So the blue dented Taurus
outside the murder scene,

511
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:39,621
what were you doing?

512
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:40,822
- Walker mentioned the address.

513
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:43,625
I was checking it out, trying
to take down some plates.

514
00:24:43,627 --> 00:24:45,193
Next thing you know, I hear gunshots.

515
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:47,128
- So you take off
not to blow your cover.

516
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,130
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

517
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:52,066
- What's your real name?
- Vanessa.

518
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:54,702
Vanessa Rojas. You?

519
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:58,840
- Kevin Atwater.
Nice to meet you.

520
00:24:58,842 --> 00:25:01,042
- You too.

521
00:25:01,044 --> 00:25:03,177
So now what?

522
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:06,180
- All right, I just brought
the deputy chief up to speed.

523
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:09,150
Per his orders, we are joining forces.

524
00:25:09,152 --> 00:25:11,319
Walker remains the priority target.

525
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:14,556
All right, Vanessa, you've got the
best relationship with this guy.

526
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,559
Anything you can tell us about
this recent double homicide?

527
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:19,661
- No, all I heard was him
mention the address.

528
00:25:19,663 --> 00:25:20,662
That's it.

529
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:22,564
- What about where he does
most of his business?

530
00:25:22,566 --> 00:25:24,098
Can you plant a wire in that back office?

531
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,334
- Too dangerous.
- I can do it.

532
00:25:26,336 --> 00:25:28,536
- Remember what I told you.
- I know.

533
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:31,272
Being a hero will get
you fired or get you dead.

534
00:25:31,274 --> 00:25:33,875
But this is easy, I promise.

535
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:34,876
- All right.

536
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:42,116
- Nina, I'm running late.
You got this?

537
00:25:42,118 --> 00:25:43,751
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.

538
00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:45,114
- Where you going?

539
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:46,688
- House warming party
for my cousin.

540
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:49,023
I just helped him buy his first house,

541
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:51,993
and the man is so happy,
he won't stop crying.

542
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,898
- Scotty, I'm gonna go grab
some stuff in the back.

543
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:10,211
All right, I'm in.

544
00:26:10,213 --> 00:26:12,447
- Copy that.
All clear.

545
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:24,892
- Rojas, get out of there.
Walker's coming back.

546
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,244
- Hey.

547
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:39,907
- What the hell
are you doing in here?

548
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:42,110
- We ran out of cognac.
Well, the good stuff, actually.

549
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:43,778
Had to raid your private stash.

550
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,350
You can check the bar
if you don't believe me.

551
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:51,036
- I'll do that.

552
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:53,788
How'd you get in?
- Your spare key.

553
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,790
You told me about it, remember?

554
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:00,161
Yo, I was just trying to help,

555
00:27:00,163 --> 00:27:02,930
but if you don't want me
in here, that's fine by me.

556
00:27:03,358 --> 00:27:05,092
- I don't.

557
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:11,272
- I won't come in here,
whether or not you invite me.

558
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:12,987
Want me to leave the cognac?

559
00:27:14,444 --> 00:27:17,111
- Take the cognac.
Leave the key.

560
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:27,528
- Rojas did a nice job.

561
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,556
- Yeah, she's quick on
her feet and--

562
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,459
- Boss, we intercepted a lot
of chatter on Walker's wire.

563
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:32,794
We're going through it all now.

564
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:34,462
Good news, we found his heroin supplier,

565
00:27:34,464 --> 00:27:36,297
a guy named Mateo Garcia.

566
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,999
- Garcia from
the Latin Players?

567
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:39,634
Walker's supposed to be at war with them.

568
00:27:39,636 --> 00:27:41,703
- Sounds like they made peace.

569
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,871
- Well, Garcia's insisting
on meeting Walker in person

570
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:45,142
as a sign of good faith.

571
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:46,641
- Okay, we got
a time and place?

572
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:48,509
- Yeah, today at 5:00.
I'm not sure where yet.

573
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:50,344
There's a lot of code
and a lot of addresses.

574
00:27:50,346 --> 00:27:51,979
They mentioned Ashburn,
but more recently,

575
00:27:51,981 --> 00:27:54,348
he's been talking about
his bakery on 21st street.

576
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,917
- All right,
let's sit on the bakery.

577
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,819
- Okay.
- We wait for Garcia to arrive,

578
00:27:57,821 --> 00:28:01,622
observe the exchange,
and arrest everyone in sight.

579
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,652
- All quiet.

580
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:08,655
- All clear in the back alley.

581
00:28:09,699 --> 00:28:12,367
- Sarge, maybe they're doing
the meet in Ashburn.

582
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:16,038
- Standby.
Let's wait it out.

583
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:22,777
- The hell?
- It's Jerald.

584
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:24,545
The kid Walker's doing business with.

585
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:27,216
- Yeah.
I've seen him around.

586
00:28:35,625 --> 00:28:36,958
- Sarge, we've got an employee

587
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,426
that just walked out of the bakery.

588
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:41,562
He gave Jerald a bag. Could be the place.

589
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:44,532
- He's getting on his bike.

590
00:28:44,534 --> 00:28:45,800
- All right, stay with him.

591
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:47,902
See if he rolls towards Ashburn.

592
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,111
- All right,
pull up right here.

593
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:01,482
He just went down Clarke.
I've got to get him on foot.

594
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:19,634
Chicago PD!

595
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:22,436
- Please don't shoot.
Please don't shoot.

596
00:29:22,438 --> 00:29:25,072
Sir, I--I was just bringing some muffins

597
00:29:25,074 --> 00:29:26,174
to Mr. Marley here.

598
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:27,909
He's a part of the program.

599
00:29:27,911 --> 00:29:28,985
- Program?

600
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:30,278
What program are you talking about?

601
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,479
- Mr. Walker's food bank.

602
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:34,415
They give all the food that
they don't use to the poor.

603
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,418
- Stand down.

604
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,120
Throw me your wallet.

605
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:46,961
University of Chicago.

606
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:48,362
- Yeah.

607
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:50,031
I just started school last month.

608
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:53,534
- What the hell are you doing
with Darius Walker?

609
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,503
- He--he helps me out.

610
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:58,372
He pays my tuition. Bought my books too.

611
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:06,781
- Hands down.

612
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:09,116
I'm sorry. Misunderstanding.

613
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,792
Sarge, we followed the kid.

614
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:19,560
He did not have drugs or cash on him.

615
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:22,029
We've got to go to the Ashburn location.

616
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,464
- Are you sure?

617
00:30:23,466 --> 00:30:24,832
- Yeah.

618
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,400
- Okay, head over there now.

619
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,705
- Deal's going down on Ashburn.
Let's move.

620
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:36,377
- All right, Jay, we're
pulling up on 19th street.

621
00:30:36,379 --> 00:30:38,012
Looks quiet around here.

622
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:42,083
- Copy that.
Nothing yet.

623
00:30:44,354 --> 00:30:46,020
- Over there in the alley.

624
00:30:46,022 --> 00:30:47,439
- Hmm?

625
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,690
Yeah, we got eyes.

626
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:52,827
- Well, what do you see?

627
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:55,196
- We see Mateo Garcia
and Darius Walker.

628
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,000
- This looks like
they're negotiating right now.

629
00:30:59,002 --> 00:31:01,035
I don't see any product or cash.

630
00:31:01,037 --> 00:31:04,038
- Just wait for the exchange.
- Copy that, Sarge.

631
00:31:06,676 --> 00:31:09,169
Okay, Garcia just pulled out a bag.

632
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,679
- That looks good.
I see product.

633
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:13,714
- Mm-hmm.
Come on, Darius.

634
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:15,249
That's quality stuff right there.

635
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:16,717
Show him the money, huh?

636
00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:21,455
- Bingo.

637
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:22,857
We've got a positive.
- Copy.

638
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:24,692
Jay, you guys take the lead.

639
00:31:24,694 --> 00:31:26,294
Kevin, Vanessa, cover the perimeter.

640
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:27,628
Let's go.

641
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:37,772
All right, let's get
these people out of here.

642
00:31:37,774 --> 00:31:39,407
Excuse me. Excuse me.

643
00:31:39,409 --> 00:31:40,274
- Kids, hey.
Move.

644
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:41,876
- Can you guys move back
the other way?

645
00:31:41,878 --> 00:31:43,878
Just go to the other side. It's okay.

646
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,379
- You two, leave the park.

647
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:46,614
Get out. Go!

648
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:50,651
- Gun!
Gun!

649
00:31:50,653 --> 00:31:51,886
- Down!
Get down!

650
00:31:51,888 --> 00:31:53,054
Everybody down!
- Get down!

651
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:55,256
- Run!
We've got a runner!

652
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:56,624
Get your hands up!
- All hands up!

653
00:31:56,626 --> 00:31:59,093
- Get on the car!
On the car!

654
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:01,128
- Don't move!
Drop your weapon right now!

655
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,930
- On the car!
I've got Walker.

656
00:32:02,932 --> 00:32:04,231
- Get against the wall!

657
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,308
- Do it!

658
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,635
- No!

659
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:13,908
You okay?
- Yeah.

660
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,077
- Vincent-21-Davis,
shots fired at the police.

661
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,279
- Copy that...
- Let's go.

662
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,751
- Stop the car!
Stop the car!

663
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:25,019
- Go, go!
- Hey!

664
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:26,620
- Get out of the car!
- Hey!

665
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:29,757
Hey, run! Run!
- Get out!

666
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:39,533
- Police!
Hey, police!

667
00:32:39,535 --> 00:32:41,335
Stop the vehicle!

668
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:47,274
- Vanessa!

669
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:16,501
- Yeah, Darius Walker,
I'm the police.

670
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:22,129
You're staring down
pretty serious charges too.

671
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:23,697
- I've got some
really good lawyers.

672
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,500
- It doesn't really matter
how good your lawyers are.

673
00:33:26,502 --> 00:33:29,180
We've got you dead to rights.
I think you know that.

674
00:33:30,072 --> 00:33:31,739
Those murders, that's a different story.

675
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:32,906
We're still investigating those,

676
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:34,602
so you've got a little leverage.

677
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:38,011
Tell me how those two Latino kids died,

678
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:39,646
and I can break you off
with a better deal.

679
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:41,774
- I've got nothing to do
with those murders.

680
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,217
- Come on, brother, do you
expect for me to believe--

681
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:44,863
- Don't call me brother.

682
00:33:45,654 --> 00:33:50,190
And no I don't expect you
to believe a damn thing I say,

683
00:33:50,192 --> 00:33:53,160
but I did not kill those two boys.

684
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:55,129
- Tell me who did.

685
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:01,613
Garcia.

686
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:05,706
- Garcia took out
his own people?

687
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:07,427
- Damn right he did.

688
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:10,305
He wanted to make amends,

689
00:34:11,222 --> 00:34:13,213
get back in business with me.

690
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:18,952
So that means the only thing
that you and I have to discuss

691
00:34:18,954 --> 00:34:21,588
is this drug case.

692
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,223
- Mm-hmm.

693
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:27,194
Which is not murder.

694
00:34:28,364 --> 00:34:29,596
But that's a serious case.

695
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:31,565
We're talking about a lot of weight,

696
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:32,666
a lot of dollars,

697
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:35,502
enough to put a low life
like you away for a long time.

698
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:38,772
- You just don't get it,
do you?

699
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:41,878
- What don't I get?

700
00:34:43,085 --> 00:34:44,217
Hmm?

701
00:34:44,255 --> 00:34:49,344
- Whether I'm here or not,
users are still gonna use.

702
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:52,586
The only difference is they're
gonna be buying the product

703
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:56,490
from some 19-year-old punk
with too much to prove.

704
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:58,559
Some badass half a gangbanger

705
00:34:58,561 --> 00:35:00,227
willing to shoot up a city block

706
00:35:00,229 --> 00:35:01,728
over a Twitter dispute

707
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,765
or a spat with some fatass girl
in tight jeans.

708
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:08,802
But the biggest difference between me

709
00:35:08,804 --> 00:35:11,905
and the person who is about to replace me

710
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:15,476
is that I reinvest my profits

711
00:35:15,478 --> 00:35:18,745
in the community and the people.

712
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,084
- So you're the Robin Hood
for black folk, huh?

713
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:25,547
- No.

714
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:30,009
No, Robin Hood stole from the rich,

715
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:32,720
gave to the poor.

716
00:35:34,263 --> 00:35:39,060
Hypothetically speaking,
I take from the weak

717
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:44,304
and give to the strong
so they can get even stronger.

718
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:54,281
Let's be honest, brother.

719
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:03,390
Some folks out there ain't got no chance.

720
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:06,693
They're weak, uninspired.

721
00:36:06,695 --> 00:36:08,896
All they think about is getting high.

722
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:12,427
So I sell them what they want, heroin.

723
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:16,737
With that money, I invest
in brothers and sisters

724
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:19,706
who got game, who got smarts,

725
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:22,576
who are willing to put in the time

726
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:26,046
and the effort to make
something of themselves.

727
00:36:26,048 --> 00:36:27,692
Legally.

728
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,517
Like it or not,

729
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:33,820
that's the only way black folks

730
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:36,326
are gonna get out of these streets.

731
00:36:37,226 --> 00:36:39,092
It ain't pretty,

732
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:42,207
it ain't fashionable to say out loud,

733
00:36:43,098 --> 00:36:44,398
but it's the truth.

734
00:36:52,007 --> 00:36:56,677
And I know none of y'all
in blue want to believe this...

735
00:36:58,447 --> 00:37:03,850
But Darius Walker is good for Chicago.

736
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:16,430
Ballistics came back on the gun

737
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:18,743
found in Garcia's car.

738
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:21,435
Striations match the bullets

739
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:23,270
that killed the two Latin Players.

740
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:30,644
Okay, so Darius was telling the truth.

741
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:34,781
- Yeah, well, we still got
a solid drug trafficking case

742
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:36,511
on this guy.

743
00:37:36,785 --> 00:37:40,487
- True, but Sarge
just think about it.

744
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,155
I mean, we get rid of Darius Walker.

745
00:37:42,157 --> 00:37:44,424
- Right.
- Whoever else takes his place

746
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:46,059
isn't going to be as disciplined,

747
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:48,462
not as intelligent,
sure as hell ain't gonna give a damn

748
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:50,358
about the black community
the way he does.

749
00:37:51,066 --> 00:37:53,266
- And here I thought
you didn't like this guy.

750
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:56,637
- I can't stand his ass, but...

751
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:01,775
As crazy as it sounds,
he does make the city safer.

752
00:38:04,446 --> 00:38:06,246
- Yeah,
maybe we are better off

753
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:08,482
with this guy on the street.

754
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,288
- That is a hell of
a proposition, Sergeant.

755
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:19,159
You really think you can
persuade Darius Walker

756
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:20,794
to play ball?

757
00:38:20,796 --> 00:38:22,496
- Well, he's a businessman.
- Mm-hmm.

758
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:24,131
- I think he'll realize that

759
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:27,697
helping the police arrest his competitors

760
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:30,037
is a hell of a lot better
than doing ten years in prison

761
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,071
for drug trafficking.

762
00:38:31,073 --> 00:38:33,206
- Big risk cutting a deal
with somebody like that.

763
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:34,941
If word gets out...
- It won't.

764
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:38,145
Look, you want big results, big arrests,

765
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:39,646
you've got to take big swings.

766
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:43,517
Now Walker will be logged in

767
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,452
as a reliable cooperating defendant.

768
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:47,540
I'll be his personal handler.

769
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,657
I mean, your only role here
is to ring the bell,

770
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:52,793
and talk about all
the high profile arrests

771
00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:55,529
your new and improved
police department is making.

772
00:38:56,632 --> 00:39:00,000
I mean, if things go as planned...

773
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:04,838
That interim tag will
be removed before Halloween.

774
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:13,013
- All right.

775
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,185
I want plausible deniability
on this across the board, okay?

776
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:23,857
- I do have a favor to ask.
Actually, it's...

777
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:27,360
It's more like a condition.

778
00:39:28,664 --> 00:39:31,565
- When things are
too good to be true, huh?

779
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:34,034
- Yeah, well,
it's a good rule of thumb

780
00:39:34,036 --> 00:39:35,977
in this town, anyway.

781
00:39:38,674 --> 00:39:40,173
- What is it?
What do you want?

782
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,520
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

783
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:55,388
What's going on? Is everything all right?

784
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,193
- Yeah, we're good.

785
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,428
Here you go.

786
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:08,535
- I don't understand.
What's--what's going on?

787
00:40:08,537 --> 00:40:11,371
- ASA is dismissing
the charges.

788
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:13,584
Insufficient evidence.

789
00:40:14,877 --> 00:40:16,376
You're good.

790
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:26,055
What'd you do?

791
00:40:27,756 --> 00:40:30,085
- All that matters
is it's done.

792
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:36,941
- Thank you, Sarge.

793
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:40,500
- Yeah.
- I owe you.

794
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:43,770
- Yeah.

795
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:47,574
- I owe you everything.

796
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:52,749
- All right.

797
00:41:00,255 --> 00:41:02,422
- I'll see you in the morning.

798
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:03,795
- Yes, sir.
