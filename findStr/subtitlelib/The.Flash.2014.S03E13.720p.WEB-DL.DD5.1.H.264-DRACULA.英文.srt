19
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,180
My name is Barry Allen,

20
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,300
and I am the fastest man alive.

21
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,010
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

22
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,600
but secretly, with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

23
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,370
I fight crime and find other meta-humans like me.

24
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,660
In an attempt to stop the evil speedster Savitar,

25
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,040
I was accidentally thrust into the future,

26
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,360
and I saw him murder the woman that I love.

27
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,960
But I won't let that happen.

28
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,130
I'm gonna do everything in my power to change the future,

29
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,780
and I'm the only one fast enough to keep her alive.

30
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,990
I am The Flash.

31
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,610
Previously on "The Flash"...

32
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,740
It's definitely a meta.

33
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,060
I think this is someone new.

34
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,910
I'm Cisco, by the way. You must be Gypsy.

35
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,660
- So this good-bye, then? - For now.

36
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,600
Caitlin, you do not want to do this.

37
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,740
Time for me to own who I really am.

38
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,320
You're one of the strongest people I've ever known.

39
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,530
You can win this fight.

40
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,570
- Jesse! - No, no.

41
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,030
- What's wrong? - Grodd.

42
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,720
He's got my dad.

43
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,530
He has him in Gorilla City.

47
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,170
It's been two weeks since he disappeared.

48
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,200
I mean, no one's seen or heard from him since.

49
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,380
Slow down. Just start from the beginning.

50
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,940
Okay, why did your dad go to Gorilla City?

51
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,110
Wait, can we slow down even further?

52
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,920
What the hell is a Gorilla City?

53
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,290
Okay, so...

54
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,220
There are sentient, highly intelligent

55
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,710
evolved gorillas in Earth-2.

56
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,420
And they all live in a city deep in the heart of Africa.

57
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,770
We sent Grodd there

58
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,890
when he went after Fay Wray here.

59
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,190
Grodd's there?

60
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,340
Why on Earth, any Earth,

61
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,530
would your father want to go there?

62
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,500
I mean, we received a mathematical cryptogram

63
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,650
at our S.T.A.R. Labs.

64
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,740
It was highly complex.

65
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,540
It took a week to decode it, but my dad and I did.

66
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,960
What did it say?

67
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,320
It was an invitation

68
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,940
from the gorillas to my dad.

69
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,510
Why Harry?

70
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,290
They wanted to meet him.

71
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,460
So he mounted an expedition with ten other people,

72
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,980
and they went into the jungle.

73
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,180
But they failed multiple check-ins,

74
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,340
and a search party went in after them.

75
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,500
But all they found were the bodies...

76
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,020
all of them beaten to death.

77
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,200
But no one's seen my dad.

78
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,670
- I mean, is he-- - No.

79
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,580
No, he's alive. They--

80
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,130
they went to a lot of trouble to get him there.

81
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,510
They need him for something.

82
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,110
We're gonna figure out what that is.

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,490
There you guys are.

84
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,440
I've been looking all over for you.

85
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,380
Are we going for coffee or what?

86
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,410
Dad!

87
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,610
Yes, that's how you say good morning, people--

88
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,970
with hugs. Hi!

89
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,060
Jesse, that's not who you think it is.

90
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,940
This is H.R.

91
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,220
You met him briefly before you left last time.

92
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,730
At your service, madame.

93
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,300
He's Harry's replacement.

94
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,960
Some would say improvement.

95
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,500
This is Harry's daughter.

96
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,900
- Yeah. - He's been kidnapped.

97
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,950
He... I didn't know. I'm so s...

98
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,730
- I thought... - Sorry about that.

99
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,540
I'm sorry, too.

100
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,490
I'm sorry I took the smile from your face.

101
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,180
What are you thinking about?

102
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,570
The future.

104
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,320
This headline from the future:

105
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,610
the city's still recovering from a gorilla attack.

106
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,100
So you're thinking this headline

107
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,280
and Harry being taken are tied together.

108
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,900
I mean, it can't be a coincidence, right?

109
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,760
Harry getting lured to Gorilla City?

110
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,160
Grodd must be planning something.

111
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,260
Seems like he's planning to come back to this Earth.

112
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,020
And not alone, by the sound of it.

113
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,000
If we rescue Harry, then maybe that stops

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,330
whatever Grodd's planning here,

115
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,840
and maybe that changes the future.

116
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,860
Which would change my future.

117
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,530
So we save Harry, we save Iris.

118
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,630
But you're not sure.

119
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,930
No, but...

120
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,710
I'm going either way.

121
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:54,350
Harry's my friend. I'm not gonna just abandon him.

122
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,390
I'm going back to Earth-2.

123
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,790
And I suppose you'll want somebody to come with you

124
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,660
who's gonna open those breaches for you?

125
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,340
We had so much fun last time.

126
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,870
Fun-ish. I'm in.

127
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,110
I'm gonna come too.

128
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,500
I have a special connection with Grodd.

129
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,400
Maybe we can use that to get through to him.

130
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,950
- Yes, okay. - Great, yeah, I'm coming too.

131
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,790
No. I'm sorry, Jesse, no.

132
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,840
Look, I didn't come here for you to take all the risk.

133
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,450
I'm going to help.

134
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,180
Your dad would kill me if I let you come along.

135
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,290
I'm a Speedster now, okay?

136
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,460
I can take care of myself.

137
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,060
I know, which is exactly why I need you to stay here.

138
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,960
I mean, this city needs protecting while we're gone.

139
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,730
Besides, maybe you can teach Wally a thing or two.

140
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,560
Wait, what is he talking about?

141
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,730
So you're-- you're a Speedster now.

142
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,520
Yeah, we're both Speedsters now.

143
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,970
Great, yeah, that's, uh...

144
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,100
that's awesome.

145
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,290
I, um-- I thought she'd be more excited than that.

147
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,960
Hey, Julian, would youaybe able to cover for me

148
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,410
at work for the next few days?

149
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,530
Few days? Why?

150
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,980
I-- I just, um, have a thing--

151
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,130
we're-- it's just--

152
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,330
it's Flash stuff.

153
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,390
Such as?

154
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,500
A friends of ours is lost on a parallel Earth,

155
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,720
and we're gonna go get him back.

156
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,530
- A parallel Earth? - Yeah.

157
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,050
This is the-- this is the multiverse.

158
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,040
I'm fascinated.

159
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,870
And do you often travel to other Earths?

160
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,090
No, I-- well, when I have to.

161
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,910
Look, Julian, will you just tell Singh that,

162
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,770
I don't know, I'm under the weather or something?

163
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,200
It's-- you know, it is kind of what we do on Team Flash.

164
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,250
We cover for each other.

165
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,320
What does Caitlin think of all this multiverse hopping?

166
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,340
- Does she approve? - She's coming with me.

167
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,670
- You're letting her go? - It's her choice.

168
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,990
Allen, it's not a wise move, surely.

169
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,040
She can barely control her cold powers as is.

170
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,160
- I mean-- - We might need her for Grodd.

171
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,970
Grodd? Gr--

172
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,390
Telepathic gorilla?

173
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,040
- Yeah. - Where-- where are you going?

174
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,290
Are you going to Planet of the Apes?

175
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,280
No, it's just a city of them, okay?

176
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,250
Will you cover for me?

177
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,740
Are you going to Planet of the Apes?

178
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,200
I'm not going to Planet of the Apes, okay?

179
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,720
Calm down. Will you cover for me?

180
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,630
I got you. Yeah, of course.

181
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,050
Okay, thank you. See you in a few days.

182
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,040
All right, now.

183
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,200
- And make sure Wally doesn't-- - I won't.

184
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,530
Because, you know, sometimes he can be a little--

185
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,530
- Barry-- - You know,

186
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,450
if given the opportunity--

187
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:19,220
Barry, I am very good at bossing my little brother around, okay?

188
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,310
- Don't worry. - All right.

189
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,560
Just please don't do anything stupid.

190
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,420
You mean like voluntarily going to a city of super apes?

191
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
I'm being serious. Rescue Harry.

192
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,180
But other than that, you-- you don't have to do this for me.

193
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,010
Everything I do is for you.

194
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,830
Good.

195
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,030
Y'all know Wally can hear you, right?

196
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,090
Sorry, Wally.

197
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,670
Be safe.

198
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,440
You see anything hinky, you run.

199
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,690
Listen to me. I don't need to tell you that.

200
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,400
- I promise. - All right.

201
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,360
Detective.

202
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,020
Indiana Jones much?

203
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,400
Cisco, my friend, this is not my first expedition,

204
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,110
and believe me, this is the perfect attire.

205
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,360
Wait, Julian, what's going on?

206
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,520
I thought you were gonna cover for me.

207
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,430
I spoke to Captain Singh.

208
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,380
He thinks we're at a morphology conference up in Bludhaven.

209
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,050
So if it's all the same to you...

210
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,770
You don't have to come, Julian.

211
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,200
You don't even know Harry.

212
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,040
A chance to travel to another dimension--

213
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,630
I mean, I wasn't gonna miss that.

214
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,480
We're not going sightseeing.

215
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,200
Neither am I.

216
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,570
Well, damn.

217
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,120
All right, Jesse, Wally,

218
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,600
you make sure this city's safe while I'm gone, all right?

219
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,760
We will.

220
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,000
Hey, Barry.

221
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,960
If you--if you see my dad, just tell him--

222
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,090
You'll see him real soon, Jesse.

223
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,330
Speedster's honor.

224
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,740
- All right, let's do this. - Okay.

225
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,610
Earth-2, here we come.

226
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,210
How was that?

227
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,360
Bloody brilliant.

228
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,790
Well, we made it.

229
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,860
Welcome to the jungle, baby.

230
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,600
Earth-2 Africa.

231
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,140
Not hot.

232
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,340
Guess global warming's not really a thing here.

233
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,090
But bugs are.

234
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,930
Someone please help me out.

235
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,100
How exactly does saving someone on this Earth

236
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,820
prevent an attack on ours?

237
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,100
If Grodd is planning to attack,

238
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,020
he's gonna need to open a breach to our Earth,

239
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,160
and the only one over here that can open one is--

240
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,540
- Harrison Wells. - Harrison Wells, yeah.

241
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,990
So if we save him from Grodd,

242
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,110
then he can't get to our Earth,

243
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,120
the attack never happens, we change the future,

244
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,890
and we're one step closer to saving Iris.

245
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,990
You want to go for a run?

246
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,080
Yeah, yeah. Maybe later.

247
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,130
Are you okay?

248
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,930
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

249
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,520
Look, I know I haven't been great at keeping in touch.

250
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,690
It's just everything's been so crazy

251
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,010
trying to train with Barry and shadowing him,

252
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,060
and I just haven't had that much time for other things.

253
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,340
Yeah, or other people.

254
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,660
That is not what I meant.

255
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,660
No, look, I--I get it. Trust me.

256
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,950
It's not easy being a hero, is it?

257
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,950
No, but I love every minute of it.

258
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,230
Great.

259
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,920
Are you sure you're okay?

260
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,170
- Because... - Yeah.

261
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,140
I'm just worried about my dad.

262
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,840
I hope we didn't interrupt you two.

263
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,240
Nope. Nothing to interrupt.

264
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:58,760
Aren't you--

265
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,380
you aren't happy she's back?

266
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,190
I am. I just wish she felt the same.

267
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,490
Ever since she got here, she's been acting so weird with me.

268
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,860
I--I don't know if it's because I have powers

269
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,740
or if it's just me.

270
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,760
Wally, she's probably still just upset

271
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,510
because her father's missing, right?

272
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,930
Yeah, it's hard to focus on other things

273
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,270
when something like that is weighing you down.

274
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah, Wally. She'll be fine.

275
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,150
Just give her some time,

276
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,610
and then, you know, lock it down.

277
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,370
- Lock it down, hmm? - Yeah.

278
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,180
What, you think I didn't notice

279
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,070
that your Facebook profile still says "Single"?

280
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,480
What? I mean, technically, I'm still single.

281
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,260
What was it?

282
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,810
Ugh, robbery in progress at O'Sullivan Bank.

283
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,760
You two go.

284
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,560
Come on, let's go.

285
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,490
- Didn't hear the news, huh? - What news?

286
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,840
That you don't mess with Kid Flash.

287
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,910
We got to get back to our friends.

288
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,150
They're expecting us.

289
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,840
Yeah, they picked some real winners.

290
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,970
I know, which is more than I can say for you two.

291
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,270
Be right back.

292
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,000
Sorry, I-- I had to stretch my legs.

293
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,420
Hey, guys, come out.

294
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,430
It's--it's nothing to see here, guys.

295
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,110
It's just a couple fools getting their asses handed to 'em.

296
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,280
Thank you.

297
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,460
Oh, my gosh, thank you.

298
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,970
Want some water?

299
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm okay, thanks.

300
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,910
It's important to stay hydrated on a parallel Earth.

301
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,720
So weird being back here on this alternate universe.

302
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,920
This is where I met my doppelganger,

303
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,980
the evil one.

304
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,030
Killer Frost.

305
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,050
She's the one I'm always afraid of becoming.

306
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,990
And where is she now?

307
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,810
Dead.

308
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,860
That's not gonna happen to you, Caitlin.

309
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,360
I'm glad you came with us, Julian.

310
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,880
You're a nice addition to the team.

311
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,160
Yeah, well,

312
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,870
I live for danger.

313
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,060
We're close, guys.

314
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,780
Do you hear that?

315
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,550
This is it.

316
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,950
It's a trap.

317
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,080
Welcome, Caitlin.

318
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,110
Knew you'd come...

319
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,480
Flash.

320
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,530
You guys all right?

321
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,400
Yeah, I'm okay.

322
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,220
Yeah, me too.

323
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,320
I've lost my gun, but I'm all right.

324
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,380
Well, looks like you're gonna have to phase us out of here.

325
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,520
I don't know. Something's holding me back.

326
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,900
Can you open a breach?

327
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,130
No dice.

328
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,650
I don't think it's the cell. I...

329
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,230
Grodd must be dampening our powers somehow.

330
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,090
Okay.

331
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,440
Harry?

332
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,310
You're all right.

333
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,370
Wells. Hey!

334
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,670
You got to help us get out of here

335
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,010
before the gorillas come back.

336
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,950
Hello, Flash.

337
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,570
- Grodd. - What?

338
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,560
That's Grodd the gorilla?

339
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,860
He's talking through Wells?

340
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,290
- That's a--a thing? - Yeah.

341
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,180
Yeah, sort of trips you out at first, but trust me,

342
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,170
you get used to it.

343
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,350
Grodd, let him go.

344
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,440
This is between you and me.

345
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,100
Not yet.

346
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,070
- I need him. - For what?

347
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,510
Why'd you lure him here?

348
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,780
For you.

349
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,130
Need your help.

350
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,300
Help? Got a funny way of asking for it.

351
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,660
You sent me here!

352
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Remember?

353
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,020
To live in this hell!

354
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,740
Where I am forced to serve

355
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,200
under the rule of Solovar.

356
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,300
Who's Solovar?

357
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,240
Leader of Gorilla Kind.

358
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,450
Ruler of Gorilla City.

359
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,770
And now...

360
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,780
he wants to rule the humans.

361
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,810
He will bring war to your Earth.

362
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,370
- Why? - He has seen many conflicts

363
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,050
between gorillas and humans.

364
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,460
He is afraid the humans will attack,

365
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,300
but now that you're here,

366
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,710
he will bring the fight to you.

367
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,960
So you lured us here to stop him?

368
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,910
As trespassers...

369
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,190
you will be sent to the arena

370
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,130
and executed.

371
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,650
What? How about a signpost at the front?

372
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,020
"All trespassers will be executed."

373
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,530
That wouldn't be the worst idea, would it?

374
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,840
Will be Solovar's great honor

375
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,700
to kill you...

376
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,610
himself.

377
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,760
But, Flash...

378
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,060
if he were to be defeated,

379
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,250
the other gorillas would see his weakness

380
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,520
and would no longer follow him.

381
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,630
Well, I'm not gonna kill anyone,

382
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,950
not even a gorilla.

383
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,380
Kill or be killed!

384
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,460
This is the only law Gorilla Kind understands.

385
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,430
How do you benefit from this, Grodd?

386
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,840
Solovar falls.

387
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,600
I take his place.

388
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,990
I rule the gorillas,

389
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,160
and I promise to keep them in Gorilla City.

390
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,880
How do we know we can trust you?

391
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,250
Because...

392
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,000
even though you sent me away,

393
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,560
your Earth is still my home.

394
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,790
And there are those among you

395
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,200
I will never forget.

396
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,830
Kill Solovar,

397
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,070
and Central City will be spared.

398
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,900
Fail, and see your home

399
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,620
turned to ash.

400
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,980
Hey, Jesse, you got a sec?

401
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,000
Did I do something wrong?

402
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,920
I don't-- I don't think so.

403
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,780
Okay, then why are you being so cold with me?

404
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,110
Jesse, come on, you can talk to me.

405
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,890
I know that this is about more than just your dad.

406
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,300
Look, I guess...

407
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:43,970
I guess I thought one day we'd figure out a way to be together.

408
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,980
You know, but now that you have your powers, it's...

409
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,130
It's like I never hear from you.

410
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,630
Jesse, if--if you would,

411
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,690
I want you to stay.

412
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,780
- I can't. - Why?

413
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,780
Because of your dad?

414
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,540
Because Barry is going to find him.

415
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,270
Look, you don't know that, okay?

416
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,270
You don't.

417
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,420
When I first got my power,

418
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,350
you were so lost not having yours.

419
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,910
You know, and I thought maybe part of the reason

420
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,440
why you liked me was...

421
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,830
'cause you were attracted to the speed and not me.

422
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,730
I know, I know, okay?

423
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,740
But I saw you out there today...

424
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,500
being Kid Flash.

425
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,810
Okay, and you were complete, Wally.

426
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,970
You were scary complete.

427
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,140
I could have all the speed in the world.

428
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,740
I'm not complete without you.

429
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,860
Stay.

430
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,780
Barry, do you really think you could kill this Solovar?

431
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,160
Do you think you could take a life?

432
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,770
It is as I feared.

433
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,760
The humans court war with Gorilla Kind.

434
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,960
Why did you not tell me, Grodd,

435
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,620
more humans had entered the city?

436
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,560
I was about to inform you, Solovar.

437
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,090
Why? Why are you here?

438
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,660
To study us like animals?

439
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,640
- Make us your pets? - No, no.

440
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm--I...

441
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,510
We came here in peace.

442
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,770
We entered your city by mistake.

443
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,060
Uh, we mean you no harm.

444
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
Please...

445
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,980
just let me and my friends go, and I promise,

446
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,560
we'll never come back here again.

447
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,050
My brethren have seen you.

448
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,120
Your fate is sealed.

449
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,380
You will all die by my hand...

450
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,090
in the arena...

451
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,850
so that all will know that Solovar's justice

452
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,490
is wise and swift.

453
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,070
All right, I'll make you a deal.

454
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,790
I'll fight you in the arena-- just me.

455
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,370
But if I beat you, you let my friends go,

456
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,510
and you leave us alone for good.

457
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,110
I accept.

458
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,320
Humans and their arrogance.

459
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,100
First you will suffer.

460
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,110
Then I will grant you each...

461
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,540
a horrible death.

462
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,950
Speedster versus super gorilla.

463
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,750
Best worst video game ever.

464
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,500
Do you really think that Barry can beat Solovar?

465
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,070
Well, he'd better, for all of our sakes.

466
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,150
It's starting.

467
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,850
After you die,

468
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,190
your friends will follow you into the black.

469
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,080
- We'll see. - Okay, Barry.

470
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,450
I got a plan for you.

471
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,060
It's all about the speed punches.

472
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,670
Speed punches. Come on, Barry.

473
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,260
Change of plan, Barry.

474
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,710
It's all about the running away.

475
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,700
What aboutbo lightning throw?

476
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,610
Yes, Barry, lightning throw!

477
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,970
Worth a shot!

478
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,560
That's oh for two.

479
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,070
Come on, Barry, get up.

480
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,940
All my days, this is quite the reversal of our fortune.

481
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,100
Reversal...

482
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,230
Barry, it's time to pull a reverse Flash.

483
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,380
Do it!

484
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,420
He did it!

485
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,890
He actually did it.

486
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,300
He bloody well did it.

487
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:42,870
I won't kill him!

488
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,370
I won't!

489
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,330
I know you all fear humans!

490
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,790
You think we want war with Gorilla Kind!

491
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,370
We don't!

492
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,350
We're not all murderers and killers!

493
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:06,840
We only want peace!

494
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,950
Which is why I'm sparing your leader!

495
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,160
We call it mercy!

496
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,760
Take him out.

497
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,960
what happened?

498
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,670
Congratulations.

499
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,660
You won.

500
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,160
What about Harry?

501
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,240
He's still catatonic.

502
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,070
- Flash. - I won.

503
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,690
Solovar promised to let us go.

504
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,760
No.

505
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,720
No? What do you...

506
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,790
I don't understand.

507
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,470
Solovar's words mean nothing now.

508
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,720
You never had any intentions of letting us go, did you?

509
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,760
I told you I needed you.

510
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:22,260
I could not defeat Solovar in combat,

511
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,280
but you could.

512
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,470
You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City,

513
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,670
and all the gorillas will follow me.

514
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,800
Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.

515
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,690
You do.

516
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,770
You took my home away from me,

517
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:40,920
and now I will take it back!

518
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,230
The gorillas saw what you did, Flash.

519
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,620
They saw you defeat Solovar,

520
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:48,210
and now they are afraid of humans

521
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,240
and will do anything I order,

522
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,660
and I will order them to invade your Earth,

523
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,380
and your city will burn.

524
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,950
You were planning this the whole time.

525
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,540
Yes.

526
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,290
Father taught me well.

527
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,730
Always think ahead.

528
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,820
And I had plenty of time to think in cages built by you

529
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,870
and then by Solovar.

530
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,840
Then why don't you just kill us?

531
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,050
Since we already did your damn dirty work for you.

532
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,330
Still need you.

533
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,730
I'm not doing anything for you.

534
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,390
Not you, Flash.

535
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,550
You.

536
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,190
Me?

537
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,920
You will open the breach to First Earth.

538
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,610
My army will cross that breach,

539
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,930
and all the humans in Central City

540
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,050
will burn before Gorilla Kind!

541
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,210
Grodd, you are smart,

542
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,210
maybe smarter than all of us,

543
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,400
smart enough to know that you cannot do this.

544
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,030
Intelligence and violence,

545
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,340
they're opposites from each other.

546
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,030
What you want to do, it's not logical,

547
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,120
not for someone as wise as you are.

548
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,570
You forget, Flash,

549
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,120
I am an animal.

550
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,170
I am a gorilla.

551
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,890
Kill or be killed!

552
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,060
I'm gonna get out of this cell, and I'm gonna stop you.

553
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,990
No, you won't.

554
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,310
You will die.

555
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,830
- Snow? - You okay?

556
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,890
I...

557
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,400
I have a headache, I guess.

558
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,710
And I think-- i--is that me? I smell.

559
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,200
That counts as okay.

560
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,070
Jesse, my daughter. Where's--

561
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,490
She's fine. She's on Earth-1.

562
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,840
She's totally fine.

563
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,940
Barry?

564
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Cisco.

565
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,710
You guys all came for me?

566
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,980
A city of evil genius apes.

567
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,020
Sounded like fun.

568
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,670
Well, I don't deserve it, but...

569
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,920
thank you, Snow; thank you, Barry,

570
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,850
Cisco...

571
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,010
Indiana.

572
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,050
It's Julian Albert, thank you.

573
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,620
And I came along for--

574
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,880
I live for danger.

575
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,600
Looks like you came to the right place.

576
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,440
I still can't phase through the bars.

577
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,440
We have to find a way out of here so we can stop him.

578
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,880
You keep saying that, but what if we can't get out?

579
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,380
What if we're stuck here? What if this is the way--

580
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,650
Well, we can't think like that.

581
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,720
While there's life, there's hope.

582
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,160
And if there isn't life?

583
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,780
What is that supposed to mean?

584
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,930
Grodd needs me to open the breach so he can attack Earth-1.

585
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,550
What if I wasn't alive to do that?

586
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,270
You planning on dying?

587
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,650
Only if you kill me.

588
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,360
Look, this is something we have to consider.

589
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,540
Right now, I can't think of any other way to stop them.

590
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,590
They'd have no other way of getting to Central City.

591
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,520
He's right.

592
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,820
Cisco's death would change the newspaper headline in the future.

593
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,640
- Headline? - It's a long story.

594
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,790
But it would also make another one come true,

595
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,940
the one about Killer Frost.

596
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,880
You want me to kill you?

597
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,950
Think about it.

598
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,880
Grodd doesn't know you have cold powers.

599
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,360
- You might be able to use them. - Cold powers?

600
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,190
She-- you have cold powers?

601
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,210
I knew it. I knew that you and I

602
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,990
did not get Barry out of that mirror.

603
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:42,130
Wait, now. Caitlin. If you kill someone,

604
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,810
there's no going back.

605
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,140
You'll be Killer Frost for the rest of your life.

606
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,570
Now, I did not come all this way to see that happen.

607
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,420
Did you come here because you "Live for danger"

608
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,950
or to protect me?

609
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,800
I just don't want to see you become something you're not.

610
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,890
Okay, Cisco.

611
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,850
I'm not gonna kill you, and neither is anyone else, okay?

612
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,510
So let's come up with the next best plan

613
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,500
that doesn't involve murdering one of our friends.

614
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,780
No, Cisco's right.

615
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,770
It's the only way.

616
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,100
One of us has to die.

617
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,570
What you doing up there?

618
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,600
Just, uh, hanging out.

619
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,810
What're you-- what're you thinking about?

620
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:43,830
Wally. He wants me to stay here with him.

621
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:47,060
Yeah, he does.

622
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,510
Guy is no dummy. Congratulations.

623
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,090
Oh, that's great. Love...

624
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,870
Nothing like young love.

625
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,320
Yeah, I just-- I don't--

626
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,370
I don't know if it's the right thing.

627
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,670
Why?

628
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,840
He's on his own journey.

629
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,990
Besides, my dad just got captured by gorillas.

630
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,010
And if-- if he does come back,

631
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,920
how could I ever tell him I'm leaving?

632
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,470
Well, 'cause you're human.

633
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,970
That's--that's how.

634
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,090
That's what we do. Look, my point is this.

635
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:15,600
When it comes to love, you got to go for it.

636
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,310
You know? Everything else be damned.

637
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,720
'Cause if you don't,

638
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,490
you're gonna end up being the kind of person

639
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,560
that lives the rest of their life with regret.

640
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,010
I mean, I know that telling your dad that, you know, you're--

641
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,010
you're switching Earths,

642
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,610
that's gonna be a difficult conversation to have,

643
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:32,770
but one that you've to go for

644
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,450
if you want to be happy.

645
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,130
But that's, you know, just my opinion.

646
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,090
What do I know?

647
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:41,080
I'm just a handsomer guy than your dad

648
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,140
with a song in his heart.

649
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,200
Good luck, Jesse.

650
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:10,790
He started coughing... violently.

651
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,170
And then he clutched his side and keeled over.

652
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,500
The injury...

653
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,720
it must have ruptured one of his kidneys.

654
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,680
He went into shock.

655
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,360
His heart stopped.

656
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,710
I couldn't resuscitate him.

657
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,050
Cold.

658
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,420
He's dead.

659
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,980
He was of no use to me anyway.

660
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,640
He's gone, Barry.

661
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:14,440
Grodd is gone.

662
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:25,920
Come on, mate.

663
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,130
Yo, it worked!

664
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,610
It worked.

665
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,390
Allen, Allen, you all right, mate?

666
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,630
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

667
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,460
I didn't freeze you too much, did I?

668
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,560
No. I'm good.

669
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,940
Well, then...

670
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,860
let's get the hell out of here.

671
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,620
Yeah.

672
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,120
Go!

673
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,510
- All right. - Hallelujah.

674
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:11,970
Let's go.

675
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:19,790
All right.

676
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,870
We should be far enough out

677
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,950
that you should be able to use your powers.

678
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,160
We need a breach open right now.

679
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,490
Guys, we got to go before they realize we're gone!

680
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,290
It's too late for that.

681
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,790
- Run! - Run!

682
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,270
Open a breach!

683
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,010
Time to warp out of this madhouse.

684
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,260
All right, go.

685
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,600
Hey, gang, who wants to take their mind off their troubles

686
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,660
with a "Sure to take your mind off your troubles" Game of charades?

687
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,770
I'll go first.

688
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,980
Okay, ah, let's see.

689
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,190
Movie--I mean...

690
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,540
one word.

691
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:12,670
Dad!

692
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,860
- You okay? - Good, yeah.

693
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,680
I'm sorry you guys missed it.

694
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,630
I ain't.

695
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,530
Word of advice:

696
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,080
don't volunteer for these things.

697
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,780
Nothing ever tries to rip you limb from limb

698
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,840
if you don't volunteer.

699
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,170
I'm fine. I'm so fine, thanks--

700
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,660
thanks to our friends,

701
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,360
our good friends.

702
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,140
You're welcome, Harry.

703
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,720
I--I think--

704
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,790
I just forgot how handsome you were.

705
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,660
Oh, I forgot.

706
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,810
He's-- you're still here.

707
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,190
Yeah. Still here.

708
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,390
I guess we have your tactical and technical genius

709
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,120
to thank for getting us out of that fix.

710
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,700
No, no, nah.

711
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,290
- Nah? - Nah.

712
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,750
You were completely right about him.

713
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,020
He's a total fraud. He's not even a scientist.

714
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,600
And I'm sure you couldn't even remember an ATM code if you tried.

715
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,230
All those-- all those numbers.

716
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,490
It's only four digits. Why is he still here?

717
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,800
Because we couldn't do it without him.

718
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,070
I thank you, Francisco.

719
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,350
Fran-- Francisco?

720
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,330
Don't ask.

721
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,470
Yo, so what actually happened?

722
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,650
You fight some really super-smart apes, or what?

723
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,590
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

724
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,210
And they were smart, but today, at least,

725
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,950
we were a bit smarter.

726
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,640
How's he doing?

727
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,360
He's gonna be okay.

728
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,830
He's got some cuts and bruises,

729
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:54,960
but Caitlin said he just needs food and a little sleep.

730
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,690
Okay.

731
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,110
Hey, I'm...

732
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,320
I'm sorry for being an epic basket case lately.

733
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,720
My, um...my dad was kidnapped once,

734
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,760
and it turns your world.

735
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,840
You turn my world, Wally.

736
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,540
Look, I--I need you to be honest about something.

737
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,230
Of course.

738
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,880
When my dad wakes up, if I tell him that I love him

739
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,980
and I'll always be his daughter

740
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,510
but that I want to move to Earth-1,

741
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,540
what would you think about--

742
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,050
That's what I think of that.

743
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm glad we think alike.

744
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:47,880
I see you're--

745
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,640
you took my love advice.

746
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,100
You know, when it comes to scientific advice,

747
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,730
mine is sometimes specious,

748
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,380
but when it comes to affairs of the heart,

749
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,180
well, I consider myself a genius.

750
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,830
Okay, yeah, we're gonna go now.

751
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,230
Okay, great.

752
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,880
Congratulations. I'm happy for you.

753
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,770
Invite me to the wedding.

754
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,880
He's gonna be so pissed.

755
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,140
Caitlin.

756
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,520
Wait.

757
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,740
Listen, if I overstepped,

758
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,510
then I apologize.

759
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,320
Just, after drinks the other night--

760
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,340
You were willing to risk your life for me?

761
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,020
I've been doing a lot of silly things recently.

762
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,000
I thought adding one more to the list wouldn't do any harm.

763
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,310
I like you, Julian.

764
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,150
I do.

765
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:39,740
And I like that you like me.

766
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,420
But I'm also afraid of my powers--

767
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,180
and not what they could do to me,

768
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,330
but what they could do to anyone who gets close to me.

769
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,630
Caitlin, I'm not afraid.

770
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,570
You should be.

771
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,800
Fear me, Julian.

772
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,850
It's not a threat, just...

773
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,260
good advice.

774
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,540
Okay, fine.

775
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,000
I'll fear you.

776
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,150
You know what really helps me when I'm scared?

777
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,040
What?

778
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,720
Just a good fillet steak...

779
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,540
bit of b¨¦arnaise on the side,

780
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,690
mashed potatoes--

781
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,780
does the trick ever time.

782
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,130
- Really? - I promise.

783
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,020
I think we should find a local steak house

784
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,750
and be terrified together.

785
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,120
Sure. Together it is.

786
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,840
Well...

787
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,710
- We did it. - You did it.

788
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,580
No, uh, we all did it.

789
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:48,440
We changed the future without changing who we are.

790
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,710
If we can keep doing this,

791
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,090
we can stop Savitar.

792
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,010
Wherever he is, however he's gonna come at us,

793
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,020
I can stop him.

794
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,350
I know it now.

795
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,150
- How do you do that? - Do what?

796
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,960
Stay positive in the face of overwhelming odds.

797
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,680
Because I plan on living a long life with you,

798
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,510
and nothing's gonna take that away from me.

799
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,150
Good.

800
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,270
So does that mean no more nightmares?

801
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,470
You're finally gonna get some sleep tonight?

802
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,640
Well... that last part is entirely up to you.

803
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,640
Like I told Flash,

804
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,020
always think ahead.

805
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,320
Now you will open the breaches

806
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:45,230
and very soon,

807
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,330
Central City will fall before Grodd.
