17
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,860
My God, Orlin.

18
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,930
You scared the living daylights out of me.

19
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,820
Did anyone follow you?

20
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,300
Of course not.

21
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,120
It's been weeks since you fought the Flash at the hospital.

22
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,960
If anyone knew you were here,

23
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,420
you would have found out by now.

24
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,650
I got you some groceries

25
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,740
and some Meloxicam for your injuries.

26
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,780
I don't need it.

27
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,280
Good to hear.

28
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,620
- How's Grace? - Nothing's changed.

29
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,340
She's stable. CCPD hasn't left

30
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,040
and they're not leaving any time soon.

31
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,910
- Well, I need to see her, Doc. - That's not possible.

32
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:56,250
Don't tell me what's possible.

33
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,560
You're angry. Good.

34
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,110
For all the pain your family has suffered

35
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,170
at the hands of those metas, you should be.

36
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,470
But right now there isn't anything you can do for Grace,

37
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,360
so put that anger towards something else.

38
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,540
I have a friend who feels the same way

39
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,260
about meta-humans as we do,

40
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,540
and he wants to help you finish what you've started.

42
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,770
Orlin?

43
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,920
It's time to get back to work.

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,810
This is it. The only thing between us

45
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,810
and our big score is one reinforced concrete wall.

46
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,520
Don't hurt yourself, Bork. - Can't hurt Bork.

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,010
But Bork can hurt you.

48
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,090
That should do it.

49
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,300
The hell?

50
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,610
You're one, too.

53
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,040
I don't know what's crazier, how big this guy is

54
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,950
or the number of incised wounds on his body.

55
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,990
Well, and the depressed skull fracture points to impact

56
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,510
with hardened surface,

57
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,890
but cause of death is definitely repeated stabbings.

58
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,970
Yeah, looks like someone was really angry.

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,910
Look at these wounds.

60
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,500
Doesn't it look like they have the same depth and diameter

61
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,930
as the ones on Gridlock's body?

62
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,460
Yeah, and like Block's and Raelene Sharp's.

63
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,430
Yeah.

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,630
Iris just got a tip.

65
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,020
Another meta-human was murdered in her apartment, same COD.

66
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,020
- Dad, these aren't one offs. - No.

67
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,150
Cicada's back and he's on a killing spree.

68
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,070
Okay, well, there's got to be a lead in one of these attacks

69
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,280
that can help us track him. We'll get the team on it.

70
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,150
Killer Frost, seriously? I can't take it anymore.

71
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,860
Uh, Caitlin, is everything-

72
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,000
Alter-ego confab.

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,010
Seen enough episodes of "Sister, Sister"

74
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,360
to recognize a sibling spat when I see one.

75
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,010
So, I'm trying to help Cisco with his meta-human cure,

76
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,720
but every time I start working on it,

77
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,610
Killer Frost takes over and messes with my equations.

78
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,060
Like this.

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,950
She changed all my heterozygotes into asterisks.

80
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,360
Oh, I thought those were just tiny snowflakes.

81
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,880
So she's not on board?

82
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,990
No, and I don't exactly know why.

83
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,160
- Can't you just ask her? - Oh, I've tried.

84
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,680
But every time we start talking about it,

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,810
she starts singing Barney's "I Love You" song.

86
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,500
- Ooh, that's cold. - Yeah.

87
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,470
What about Cisco? Is he having any luck?

88
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,180
Not yet.

89
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,250
He went to the Tannhauser off-sites so he could concentrate.

90
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,510
He says it's quiet there.

91
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,030
Yeah. Quiet like a tomb.

92
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,040
So I think if I can isolate the genetic marker

93
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,350
that bonds human DNA to dark matter,

94
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,870
I can reverse engineer the process

95
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,740
and unravel it to create a cure.

96
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,040
- That's great. - Yeah, except I need meta-DNA

97
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,030
that hasn't fully bonded with dark matter yet.

98
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,730
Of course, because as we all know

99
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,870
with genetic modification we-- Why?

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,900
Because that's the only time when I can identify

101
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,340
where the marker is in the genome.

102
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,570
Okay, so you need DNA from a meta-human who was created recently?

103
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, ideally in the last eight months,

104
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,640
but everyone I can think of has been killed by Cicada.

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,620
Right.

106
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,840
So where the heck do we look?

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,280
The lone decrypted entry from the journal of Nora West Allen:

108
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,170
"The timeline is malleable."

109
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,450
Why that's the only one that translated?

110
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,830
And why is she interested in the timeline,

111
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,950
and maybe more important,

112
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,170
why is she hiding this interest?

113
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,790
Sherloque, we need you in the cortex.

114
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,650
But of course.

115
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,600
Kira May, Dwayne Geist, Carl Bork.

116
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,060
All three metas who were killed by Cicada last night.

117
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,430
So Cicada's killed almost as many people

118
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,370
in the last 12 hours as he has in the last eight months?

119
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,350
And it doesn't look like he's slowing down anytime soon.

120
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,520
Well, we need to stop him before he hurts anyone else.

121
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,770
Sherloque, do you have any ideas on what to do about that?

122
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,550
Not at the moment,

123
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,270
but any time I run into a road block in an investigation,

124
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,940
I do what I always do.

125
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,090
I just pursue a different avenue.

126
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,460
We'll find him. Something will bring him to us.

127
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,510
Something like--

128
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,640
Satellites picking up dark matter flare. It's him.

129
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,520
Something like that.

130
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,920
Suit up. We don't have a lot of time.

131
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,620
Not without precautions. For Killer Frost.

132
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,000
She doesn't need a weapon. Killer Frost is the weapon.

133
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,530
Powers or no powers, I will mess you up.

134
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,870
Negate this!

135
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,120
Hold on. Help!

136
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,190
We need Caitlin.

137
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,660
We need to get her to a hospital.

138
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,900
Here, come with me.

139
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,730
Oh God.

140
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,860
No!

141
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,530
Nora. Hey, Nora, Nora?

142
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,570
Okay, Nora-- Nora?

143
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,410
Nora?

144
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,810
Well?

145
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,410
Cicada caused an axial burst fracture

146
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,370
in her L3, L4, and L5 vertebrae.

147
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,830
He also severely displaced her fourth thoracic vertebrae.

148
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,610
It's not good.

149
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,920
But her speed healing is going to kick in, right?

150
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,870
Right?

151
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,350
Cicada's cut flooded her body with dark matter.

152
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,940
It's affecting her powers.

153
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,520
Her speed healing should kick in...

154
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,120
for now.

155
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,270
I'll keep monitoring her progress.

156
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,520
- Barry. - It's okay, she'll heal.

157
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,830
It'll be all right.

158
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,000
Nora?

159
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, what happened?

160
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,270
Honey, um...

161
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,870
Oh, why does it hurt to breathe?

162
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,630
It's gonna hurt for a little bit.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,040
Why?

164
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,420
I can't move my legs.

165
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,990
Um, why can't I move my legs?

166
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,250
- Mom, I can't move my legs. - Nora.

167
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,380
Mom? Mom, why can't I move my legs?

168
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,860
Nora, look.

169
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,520
You can't move your legs because...

170
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,790
Cicada broke your back.

171
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,940
What? So I'm paralyzed?

172
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,270
- What, forever? - No, no, not forever.

173
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,750
Well, for how long then?

174
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,450
We don't know.

175
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,760
Mom...

176
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,570
Hey, I got here as fast as I could.

177
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,360
Joe's still in Tibet.

178
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,250
I left him a message to get back ASAP.

179
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,680
Hey, it's all right. He should stay with Wally.

180
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,530
Oh, my God.

181
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,220
- How is she? - It's not good.

182
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,290
I'm so sorry, Barry.

183
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,040
Hey, I don't care how we do it.

184
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,320
- We need to stop Dwyer now. - Well, I agree.

185
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,640
All right, Well, I'm gonna call Cisco.

186
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,340
We should get him back here.

187
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,580
No, no, no, he-he should finish the cure he's working on.

188
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,140
His time is better spent there.

189
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,480
- Sherloque. - Oui?

190
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,010
Earn your money. How do we track this guy?

191
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,280
Well, I think the first thing we should do

192
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,810
is concentrate on the victims. Look for a connection.

193
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,300
Take a look here for example. This man, Geist,

194
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,180
has a spider tattoo on his neck,

195
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,620
generally indicating he was caught in some form of web.

196
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,320
What kind of web? A prison web, perhaps.

197
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,090
And Kira May-She was wearing clothes.

198
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,300
Of course she was wearing clothes, Giraffe.

199
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,610
No, she was wearing clothes that are two sizes too large.

200
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,480
Two sizes too large. Recent rapid weight loss.

201
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,780
It's a common side effect of solitary confinement.

202
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,910
Right. And Carl Borg--

203
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,660
And Carl Borg, this report says he had a droopy eyelid

204
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,090
which is nerve paralysis,

205
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,960
common side effect of consuming too much Borat.

206
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,770
Or as it's known on this earth, Bruno.

207
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,200
More commonly known as prison wine.

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,090
Prison wine.

209
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,690
All three of these meta-humans were former criminals.

210
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,830
Look at this.

211
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,850
It's a meta-human arrest log from 2018.

212
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,430
Look at the first three names.

213
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,780
These were his victims.

214
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,420
He's killing in the order of this list.

215
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,620
This list has addresses, employment information.

216
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,820
It's got license plate numbers. This is everything

217
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,300
Cicada needs to find them.

218
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,250
Where would he even get this?

219
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,380
I think there's only one place, right?

220
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,580
There's a killer still at large in our city.

221
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,890
People are afraid of being out in the streets.

222
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm getting 100 phone calls a day about this guy.

223
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,990
I want neighborhoods re-canvassed.

224
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,460
I want evidence re-examined. Jonesy!

225
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,390
Take your unit and paper the city with Dwyer's photo.

226
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,690
I want this guy. Let's go get him!

227
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,530
Allen?

228
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,230
We need to talk... in private.

229
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,490
All right.

230
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,390
What the hell is this?

231
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,510
That's how Dwyer's getting his victims.

232
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,600
This is from our database of meta-humans?

233
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,680
Well, it doesn't prove he got it from CCPD.

234
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:49,840
Doesn't it?

235
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,300
He could have broken into another precinct

236
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,810
or hacked into the CCPD database.

237
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,630
David Dwyer is a machinist. He's not a hacker.

238
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,560
Somebody gave this to him. Somebody here!

239
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,970
Okay, Barry, maybe we should go ahead

240
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,470
and let Captain Singh look into this on his own.

241
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,330
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

242
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,000
Thank you, David.

243
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,570
Hey, Barry. Barry.

244
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,740
Barry, where are you going?

245
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,120
I don't know, Cecile,

246
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,300
but I gotta do something

247
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,660
before Dwyer kills all the people on that list.

248
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,470
What if we use it, too?

249
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,820
- What? - The list.

250
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,840
Three years ago, Joe asked me to help get meta-humans

251
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,420
transferred out of the city.

252
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,190
Yeah, I remember. You told him not to do it.

253
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,250
Yeah, well, that was before I knew what I know now.

254
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,490
Besides, those metas were active prisoners.

255
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,680
These metas, they've already served their time.

256
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,550
Look, even if we got 'em out of town, it wouldn't matter.

257
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,390
Cicada's gonna track them down eventually.

258
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,220
They need new names, new identities.

259
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,780
We don't have the resources to do that.

260
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,010
No, we do not.

261
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,700
But the Feds do.

262
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,690
They give this kind of protection to regular humans all the time.

263
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,520
It is about time they start offering it to meta-humans, too.

264
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,670
I am going to go call in every favor I have ever banked

265
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:02,440
and I am going to make this thing happen,

266
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,480
and in the meantime,

267
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,070
you need to go get them somewhere safe.

268
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,150
- All right. - Okay.

269
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,160
So, can you try wiggling your toes?

270
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,540
I can't.

271
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,310
Again?

272
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,180
I can't.

273
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,540
Anything?

274
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,960
I don't feel anything.

275
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,220
Okay, well, Cicada's dark matter has left your system,

276
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,170
so you should be healing soon.

277
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,650
I mean, since my last scan,

278
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,950
your spinal axons have grown five millimeters.

279
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,420
That's something, right?

280
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,550
It's progress.

281
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,530
Maybe not quite the speed we were hoping for,

282
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,770
but it's something.

283
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,930
I'm going to go run a few more tests.

284
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,910
Don't give up, okay?

285
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,420
Growth is growth.

286
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,150
Normal axon growth rate

287
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,990
reaches five millimeters a day in a large nerve.

288
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,950
With speed healing,

289
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,970
mine should be over 100.

290
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,910
How do you know that?

291
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,720
I took neuro-regeneration in my fifth grade STEM class.

292
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,130
I took fractions in fifth grade.

293
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,180
What if I don't heal, Mom?

294
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,950
What if I never get better?

295
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,110
Can I just be left alone for a little bit, please?

296
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah. Okay.

297
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,030
I respect your right to protest the cure, Frosty,

298
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,610
but even for me, that is excessive.

299
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,640
Well, maybe Caitlin will get the hint now.

300
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,420
Snow and Frost are having creative differences.

301
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,530
I'll get Caitlin.

302
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,440
No, I-I need you, actually.

303
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,500
We need to get all those metas to a safe house

304
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,150
before Cicada finds them.

305
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,060
Oh, and you think they're going to listen to me?

306
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,360
50-50 on that.

307
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,240
I haven't quite lived up to my name.

308
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,820
But I do know where we should start.

309
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,150
Doesn't look like anyone's been here in months.

310
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,700
Maybe the rumors about Amunet skipping town are true.

311
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,910
We're not here for Amunet.

312
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:52,940
We're here for her pet snake.

313
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,610
And the thing about snakes is,

314
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:57,700
they're always lurking in some dark corner.

315
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,560
Hello, Norvock.

316
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,630
Frost, thank God it's you.

317
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,780
Those are Cicada's targets,

318
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,770
but we need your help rounding everyone up

319
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,670
so we can get them to safety.

320
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,580
Because they're not going to trust a bunch of masks?

321
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,350
They will if you tell them it's for their own good.

322
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,360
Some of these guys are bad news.

323
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,730
You sure they're worth saving?

324
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,850
Are you? Cicada's not going to stop

325
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,030
until every meta in this city is dead.

326
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,190
Is that how you want to end up?

327
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,860
Damn. What did he do to you?

328
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,180
We've arranged for everyone to enter

329
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,770
a witness protection program.

330
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,290
Federal agents will lead you out of the city to safety tonight.

331
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,470
All right.

332
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,660
I'm in, but only if I'm the first one on that transport.

333
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,700
Nice of you to look out for your fellow metas.

334
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,640
I look out for me and me alone.

335
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,020
Then let's get to rounding up.

336
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,010
Yup.

337
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,250
- David. - If this is about that list...

338
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,430
It is, but it's not what you think.

339
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,970
I need your help.

340
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,150
With what?

341
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,450
I'm having those metas moved to federal protection,

342
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,740
which is where you come in.

343
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,040
What do you need?

344
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,270
Road blocks, tonight, from Linsin to Webber Avenue.

345
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,630
I know, David, I know,

346
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,130
but I can't risk any incoming traffic

347
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,370
during the scheduled transfer.

348
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,300
I'll make it happen.

349
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,370
Thank you.

350
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,820
Officer Jones.

351
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,800
You all right?

352
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,810
Never better.

353
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,170
I'm tired of waiting.

354
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,470
This Cicada, he wants to kill us?

355
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,140
I say we kill him first.

356
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,810
You can't. We're your only chance.

357
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,160
So you keep saying.

358
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,150
Look, if you're too dumb to recognize the truth,

359
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,110
then you can go, but you're on your own.

360
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,280
I'm not going to watch anybody else be broken by this maniac.

361
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,720
He's telling the truth.

362
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,330
I saw Cicada kill Carl Bork.

363
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,790
Bork's dead?

364
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,340
His dagger took away our powers.

365
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:30,130
I ran, Bork fought.

366
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,610
That's why I'm here and he's not.

367
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,990
So, yeah, leave if you want,

368
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,290
but I'm gonna listen to these guys

369
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,640
and stay alive.

370
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,890
That was quite the speech back there.

371
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,650
Almost seemed like you actually wanted

372
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,260
to save those meta-humans.

373
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,450
No, you know me better than that.

374
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,960
No, I don't think I do.

375
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,670
I used to be a good guy, you know?

376
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,780
I worked at the Central City Zoo, watching the reptile cage.

377
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,800
We were open the night the particle accelerator blew up.

378
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,650
After the blast shattered all the cages,

379
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,400
I had to pull an elapid snake off a kid.

380
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,130
Then that dark matter hit.

381
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,130
What happened to the kid?

382
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,250
He's fine.

383
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,620
But what do I get, huh? A snake in my head?

384
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,050
And a psycho killer that wants me dead?

385
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,040
That was the last time I put anyone else before myself.

386
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,970
You know, it's almost like a small part of me feels

387
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,480
sorry for that guy.

388
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,180
Why? He's only out for himself.

389
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,230
Come on, he's clearly terrified.

390
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,900
I know what that's like.

391
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,840
You're going to tell me that you've never felt fear like that?

392
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,720
- No, why? - Really?

393
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,910
Not even a little bit worried about Caitlin making the cure?

394
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,150
Is that everyone?

395
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,040
Everyone except Shawna Baez.

396
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,360
A meta that calls herself Peek-A-Boo?

397
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,850
Anyone know where she'll be?

398
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,180
Try the Sundollar on Eighth.

399
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,160
All right.

400
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,040
Bar's not open yet. Not even for you, Flash.

401
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,710
Shawna. I need you to come with me.

402
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,760
I didn't do anything this time.

403
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,500
I know. You're not in trouble.

404
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,450
All right, you're in danger.

405
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,070
I want to take you some place safe.

406
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,030
Like your science prison? Sorry.

407
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,580
Shawna? Please.

408
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,280
Somebody is trying to kill you.

409
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,690
Someone's always trying to kill me.

410
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,460
See ya around, Flash.

411
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,740
What did you do to me?

412
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,710
Shawna, run.

413
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:24,350
Who the hell is that?

414
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,630
Take this, press the button.

415
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,390
When a breach opens, jump into it.

416
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,460
Go!

417
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,710
Come on, come on...

418
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Make this thing work.

419
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,190
They're all terrified. I can feel it.

420
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,130
Maybe now they believe us.

421
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,520
Hey, we're almost through this.

422
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,060
We are going to get all of these people to safety.

423
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,300
Even if we do, Cicada's not going to stop killing.

424
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,850
- Not until-- - Until he's dead.

425
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,140
- I didn't say that. - You didn't have to.

426
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,470
The anger that I feel from you says it all.

427
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,340
How am I supposed to feel? He almost killed Nora.

428
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,440
Barry, I understand, I do.

429
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,260
That man hurt your child.

430
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,060
But this anger that you're feeling,

431
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,730
I have felt it before...

432
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,530
from Cicada.

433
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,680
Honey, if you let it, this rage will consume you,

434
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,070
the same way it's already consumed him.

435
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,710
Wait, I have felt this anger from someone before.

436
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,950
At CCPD. Oh, my God, Barry,

437
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,740
I think I know who leaked the list.

438
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,640
Then let's go get him.

439
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,180
No, no, no, you-- you stay here.

440
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,730
You get these metas to the drop.

441
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,640
I can handle the rest.

442
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,240
Ah, well, look. Neurological delight.

443
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,810
Why, you'll be back on these feet

444
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,730
and chasing Cicada in no time.

445
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,660
I hope so.

446
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,200
Yes. In the meantime, maybe you can help me do the same.

447
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,810
Oh, I already told the team everything I know

448
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,080
about the Flash museum.

449
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,420
Flash museum, right.

450
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,820
Do you think that I could look at the archives

451
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,010
from that Flash museum?

452
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,740
After all, I have made a career

453
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,900
out of noticing things that other people miss.

454
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,510
Maybe it's not a problem to bring those archives

455
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,860
for me to look at?

456
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,230
ah, I guess so.

457
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,470
Or maybe it's easier for me to go there?

458
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,760
You want me to bring you to the future?

459
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,510
It's a great suggestion.

460
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,230
Is it even possible for a non-speedster

461
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,960
to go into the commodity-- What'd you call it? The, um...

462
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,250
- The Speed Force? - Speed Force. Right.

463
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,110
Uh, I'm not sure.

464
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,420
Right.

465
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,470
Well, perhaps that's a question for someone with more experience.

466
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,770
Sherloque.

467
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,310
Can I talk to you for a second?

468
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,090
Excusez-moi.

469
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,000
- That's my daughter in there. - Yes, so?

470
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,930
And I'm going to do whatever it takes to protect her.

471
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,000
Even from people who I thought were her friends.

472
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,820
So I'm gonna need you to tell me right now

473
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,560
why you're investigating Nora.

474
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,040
Invest--no, no. Quoi?

475
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,610
No one's investigating Nora.

476
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,780
Quoi? No one's investigating Nora.

477
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,020
Maybe I'm investigating Nora a little bit.

478
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,270
Why?

479
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,970
You think, what, Nora is hiding something?

480
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,150
No, um...

481
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,400
How can I say this?

482
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,020
Sometimes when you're a detective,

483
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,940
you see a story and you follow it.

484
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,150
And there's different tracks.

485
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,340
You follow down the track.

486
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,970
With Nora, I am following down this track.

487
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,460
Do you know how many stories I've chased

488
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,260
that went absolutely nowhere?

489
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,060
So many that I stopped chasing them for a while

490
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,790
instead of doing what I should have done,

491
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,840
something you suggested, actually,

492
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,300
which is going down a different track.

493
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,610
That track is the wrong one.

494
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,710
Careful with your little monocle.

495
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,410
Learn to take notes like everyone else.

496
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,670
Nora!

497
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,680
Oh, my goodness.

498
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,600
What do you want, Ralph?

499
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,330
I know it's none of my business

500
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,630
why you're afraid of a cure,

501
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,660
but for what it's worth, I'm a meta,

502
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,010
and I'm all for it.

503
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,490
And after talking with most of those people out there...

504
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,080
So are some of them.

505
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,460
Oh, yeah, I can see that.

506
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,170
I just don't understand why.

507
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,100
It might save their lives.

508
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,140
It's not that simple for me.

509
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,700
Why not?

510
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,410
Because, just like Norvock didn't ask for his snake,

511
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:39,750
Caity didn't ask for me.

512
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,770
So if one day she wakes up scared of being a meta-human

513
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,810
and decides to take that cure,

514
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,410
her powers don't just disappear.

515
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,900
I do too.

516
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,540
That's what I'm really afraid of.

517
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,960
'Cause if I'm gone who's going to protect her?

518
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,510
It's witching hour.

519
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,860
I get why you're scared, but...

520
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,500
you need to know that when DeVoe made you disappear,

521
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,250
all Caitlin talked about was getting you back.

522
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,000
So maybe as much as you want to protect her,

523
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,650
Caitlin wants to protect you, too.

524
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,850
I went after three of them tonight and they weren't there.

525
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,180
Did you tip them off?

526
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,260
No, I swear.

527
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:41,910
After what that Spencer woman did to me with her meta-tech,

528
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,470
I want them all gone.

529
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,240
- Then what happened? - The D.A.

530
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,930
She figured out you're targeting everyone

531
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,400
on the list I gave you.

532
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,220
The contact of mine with the Feds says they're being picked up

533
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,010
and put into protective custody.

534
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,990
Tonight.

535
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,250
Where?

537
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,560
Boys and girls, your ride's here.

538
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,010
What the hell?

539
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,370
Everybody get back!

540
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,260
Thank you, Flash,

541
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,690
for bringing them all to me.

542
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,250
The chopper's not going to be able to land.

543
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,760
Take everybody out the back and get them on it somehow.

544
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,570
Come on.

545
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,310
No, he's mine.

546
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,500
All right, we're out of the dampening field.

547
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,400
Shawna, can you help?

548
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,720
Every meta for themselves.

549
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,060
What now?

550
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,870
I don't suppose you can run up my arm, can you?

551
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,920
Ralph, what are you planning to do?

552
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,490
Remember, Baby Giraffe,

553
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,460
they took a leap of faith with you.

554
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,060
That's why I'm going to take a leap for them, Shirley.

555
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,650
All right, everybody. Straight line, single file,

556
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,070
tuck your arms in.

557
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,200
- Keep this thing steady. - Roger that.

558
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,240
Stand there!

559
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,510
Tuck your arms.

560
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,770
You can't win this fight.

561
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,130
I bet I can.

562
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,410
We haven't been formally introduced.

563
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,160
They call me Killer Frost. Let me show you why.

564
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,250
Killer Frost, duck!

565
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,500
- You saved me. - You saved them first.

566
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,920
Nice work.

567
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,000
Let's get out of here for real!

568
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,240
Give him hell, Flash!

569
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,030
Okay, you see, the metas are on the move. Bravo.

571
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,200
Something's wrong with Barry.

572
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,700
What?

573
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,930
I've never seen these kind of readings from Barry's suit.

574
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,700
He's channeling over 2.86 billion joules of energy.

575
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,350
That's a combined equivalent of--of almost three lightning bolts.

576
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,090
Cicada's powers allow him to sustain injury

577
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,200
but not that much.

578
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,410
Barry. Barry.

579
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,270
He's not going to stop.

580
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,750
You're never gonna hurt my daughter again!

581
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,410
Dad!

582
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,670
No.

583
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,330
Oh, I'm sorry. I let him get away.

584
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,120
No, you brought me back.

585
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,030
Alright, the Feds have processed Norvock

586
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,280
and the other metas, giving them new identities,

587
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,120
so everybody's safe.

588
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,550
Satellite hasn't registered any unaccounted for dark matter

589
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,760
so, wherever Dwyer is, his dagger's not in use.

590
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,920
Psh, after the beating Barry gave him,

591
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,550
ain't no way he's using that dagger anytime soon.

592
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,630
What? He got what he deserved.

593
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:10,430
Oh, no, I think we appreciate your groove.

594
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:14,150
Also I think that Killer Frost and the Flash combination is

595
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,180
enough to maybe have Dwyer

596
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,730
not want to show his face around here any time soon.

597
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,300
Dad, are you okay?

598
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,660
I'm good.

599
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,410
What matters is that you're okay.

600
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,600
How's it feel to be up and running again?

601
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,110
Super frickin' schway.

602
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,730
Uh, wanna know what's not super frickin' schway?

603
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:31,500
Cicada knowing exactly when and where

604
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,820
our secret transport was taking place.

605
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,390
Mm. Inside job, right?

606
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,070
Cicada clearly has a inside man, only--

607
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,550
Only what kind of cop would help Cicada kill innocent people?

608
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,360
One that's going to have to answer to D.A. Cecile Horton.

609
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,770
Captain, you wanted to see me?

610
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,900
Come on in.

611
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,440
Officer Jones,

612
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,430
this was printed off of your hard drive.

613
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,190
Copy of the list of metas that Cicada's been pursuing.

614
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:05,900
Funny thing, it is the same list that we know you accessed

615
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,040
on your home computer just this week.

616
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,820
Care to tell me why you decided to aid and abet a murderer?

617
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,850
No, that's not--you don't know what you're talking about.

618
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,850
Really?

619
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,700
A woman used meta-human tech to take control of your mind.

620
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,050
She made you do things that you were certain

621
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,610
you would never do.

622
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,160
And that frightened you, didn't it?

623
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:30,970
It frightened you and it made you angry,

624
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,330
and you went ahead and you embraced that anger

625
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,140
and you let it drive your every move.

626
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,890
Betrayal. Revenge.

627
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,840
Escape.

628
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,510
The metas in this city have no respect for human life.

629
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,850
They don't deserve to breathe our air.

630
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,590
You swore an oath to protect the citizens of this city.

631
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,130
Every one of them.

632
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,120
Get him out of my sight.

633
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:15,500
You know, your instincts have always been sharp.

634
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,780
But knowing he was going to try to escape?

635
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,210
Could have swore you were reading Jonesy's mind.

636
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,100
It's a funny thing, yeah.

637
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,890
Since Jenna was born, I've been

638
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,190
a lot more in touch with my feelings.

639
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,270
When Joe gets back,

640
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:39,360
the two of you will be a force to be reckoned with.

641
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,700
Oh, we already are.

642
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,840
Killer Frost, you shouldn't have.

643
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,030
It's the closest you're getting to an apology from me, so...

644
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,430
Well, maybe that's why I can hear you

645
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,380
without the M.A.D. 2.0.

646
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,690
Or maybe it's because you've stopped hating me.

647
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,020
I didn't hate you.

648
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,620
I thought you were being stupid.

649
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,890
There's a difference.

650
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,000
Hey, you know I'd never take that cure, right?

651
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,890
Even if it means sharing a body with me

652
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,680
until you get old and grey?

653
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,660
Of course.

654
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,940
You're a part of me that I never want to lose.

655
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,540
I promise, I will do everything I can to protect you.

656
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,370
Right back at you, Caity.

657
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,620
Now, don't get all soft on me,

658
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,540
but I got you a little something.

659
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,750
Check the cooler.

660
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,150
Hey, Frosty. Oh, Caitlin.

661
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:52,340
Is that a ball of ice with blood inside of it?

662
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,060
I think Killer Frost took it from Cicada.

663
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,090
Ralph, this isn't just blood.

664
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:02,050
This is a DNA sample from a recently created meta-human.

665
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,050
- So Killer Frost came around. - Yeah.

666
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,500
She did.

667
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:09,920
Ugh, I said don't get soft.

668
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,010
Begin handwriting analysis.

669
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,590
As I suspected, the journal of Nora West Allen

670
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,010
contains two different types of handwriting.

672
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,020
So...

673
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,000
There is a mastermind behind the scenes.

674
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,910
The only question is...

675
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:42,840
who?

676
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,750
Okay, 47 tacos is officially my limit.

677
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,290
I think that's anyone's limit, honey.

678
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,070
A healing speedster's gotta eat.

679
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:04,250
Healed, Dad. I'm fine.

680
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,600
I promise.

681
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,740
Hey, uh, dinner again tomorrow night?

682
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,730
- Yeah. - Yeah, Nora? Um...

683
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,720
I just...

684
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,290
just want you to know how much we love you.

685
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:36,310
See? She's back to her old self.

686
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,310
And so are you.

687
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,060
No, I'm not.

688
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,950
In fact, I don't think I'll ever be the same.

689
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,430
All of this has made me realize that, I don't know,

690
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:56,450
I just--I never knew I was capable of even caring

691
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,590
for someone as much as I care about Nora.

692
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
I did.

693
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,040
I've never met anyone with a bigger heart than you, Barry.

694
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,930
So it's no surprise to me that you are a fantastic father.

695
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,870
Just like you're a fantastic husband.

696
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,070
Cicada's a father, too.

697
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,290
What if the key to defeating him is appealing to his heart?

698
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,270
- How do we do that? - By saving his child.

699
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,880
We need to wake up Grace.
