17
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,110
I want you to think about

18
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,000
the biggest secret in your life.

19
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,810
The one you keep from the people that you love

20
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,760
or even from yourself.

21
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,190
I want you to imagine what would happen

22
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,060
if that secret got out.

23
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,240
Remember when you asked me that?

24
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,070
I've been using all of your training.

25
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,110
Studying my pulse, managing micro-expressions,

26
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,240
limiting non-congruent gestures,

27
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,370
destroying any piece of evidence.

28
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,800
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

29
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,530
And not just because of the risks.

31
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,240
But because the closer I get to my parents,

32
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,540
the more I feel like I'm hurting them.

33
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,920
Data entry complete, Gideon.

34
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,150
Thank you, Nora West-Allen.

35
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,730
Shall I send this to the usual recipient?

36
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,410
Yes.

37
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,720
Send it to Eobard Thawne,

38
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,960
priority level urgent.

41
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,420
You ready for this?

42
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,260
Dad, I'm just--I'm not fast enough yet.

43
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,390
No backing out now, this is the biggest race of your life.

44
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,790
- Get ready, set, go! - Not really. Dad, Dad--

45
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,540
Wait, wait! Oh, God.

46
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,780
Gotcha.

47
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,240
This is so embarrassing.

48
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,050
I'm really good at the ice skating game on my Pocket Pal!

49
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
Okay, you're just gonna bend your knees...

50
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,890
- Kay. - And lead forward a little.

51
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,090
Just, yeah.

52
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,560
Yeah.

53
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
- I'm doing it. - You're doing it.

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,930
I'm skating. This is like schway city, Mom.

55
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,180
Thanks.

56
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,090
Look at you guys.

57
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,610
- Such a mom. - What? What about you?

58
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,130
You're the one who sprang for ice skating and game night.

59
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,980
Yeah, well, I know when Nora got hurt,

60
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,330
I got a little frustrated.

61
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,530
And now, I mean, we have an actual plan to stop Cicada.

62
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,260
Waking up his niece to appeal to his heart.

63
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,860
I know Dwyer's a killer, but he's still a person,

64
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,860
and he loves Grace just like we love Nora.

65
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,890
So I don't know. I just feel like

66
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,780
everything's heading in the right direction.

67
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,760
Here I come. Coming in. Here we go.

68
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm sorry, why are you wearing a helmet?

69
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,500
I thought you were made of rubber.

70
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,530
Somebody's gotta set a good example for these kids.

71
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,310
Well--I thought you grew up on the ice.

72
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,750
Well, I did, basically,

73
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,640
my mom dated a zamboni operator, so...

74
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,010
And I tell you where I'm from we don't date zamboni drivers.

75
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,860
Why is that? Because there are no zambonis.

76
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,640
How do we clear the ice? All winter long,

77
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,990
we are on our hands and knees with a squeegee in hand.

78
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,030
Let me tell you.

79
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,330
Best eight months of the year for this guy.

80
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,730
It's a really great story, Sherlock.

81
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,640
Sherloque.

82
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,010
You know, speaking of squeegeeing,

83
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,340
you know who could use a good squeegeeing

84
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,480
is Larry Blumenthal. He's dead.

85
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,820
- Larry Blumenthal is dead? - Yeah.

86
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,980
The patent registrar across the hall from you

87
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,730
with the 400 square footage--

88
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,280
- And the courtyard views? - Yeah, dead as a doornail.

89
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,020
You can have that place if you want it. Yours to rent.

90
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,770
What? Oh, my God. This is perfect.

91
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,940
I mean, my ad revenue has been up this quarter, so...

92
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,580
Yeah, with the extra space you'd be able to hire

93
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,690
editors, photographers.

94
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,390
I could turn my blog into a real newspaper.

95
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,910
Oh, my package has arrived.

96
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,280
What package?

97
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,900
This is the solution to all our problems.

98
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,110
Allez, les amis. We must go.

99
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,120
Madames et monsieurs,

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,350
may I present to you la Machine ¨¤ M¨¦moire,

101
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,130
or as they say in Am¨¦rique, you know...

102
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,140
The Memory Machine.

103
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,780
Oui, Iris. Memory Machine. Many times...

104
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,440
I have entered into people's minds

105
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,240
using this very technology.

106
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,140
From the unfortunate comatose victims

107
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,030
of the Summerholt Institute to, yes,

110
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,290
the Terrible Mad Hatter Killer from Earth-221.

111
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,430
I come back from Tannhauser for one second,

112
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,180
just borrowing a splicer for the meta cure

113
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,820
and what do I find?

114
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,100
- This, this-- - Machine ¨¤ M¨¦moire.

115
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,140
Whatever. How did you even get this here from Earth-221?

116
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,720
Well, I used the Forerunner Multiversal Delivery Service.

117
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,600
You don't use it? You don't have a gold card like me?

118
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,840
Maybe I'll get you a discount.

119
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,810
We don't need a discount.

120
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,610
All right, we just need to wake up Grace.

121
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,170
This'll wake her up, right?

122
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,250
So in most coma patients,

123
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,300
high traffic areas of brain activity go dormant

124
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,610
and the low traffic areas spring to life,

125
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,170
but unfortunately, Grace isn't normal.

126
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,650
Not only has her coma lasted longer than the average,

127
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,920
but her consciousness has isolated itself

128
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,190
into one specific region,

129
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,610
her long-term memories.

130
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,710
It will be so facile, easy peasy for you.

131
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,610
All you do is you transmit your brainwaves

132
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,850
into Grace's memories, right?

133
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,690
And then you'll lead her consciousness

134
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,690
out of a neural nexus portal.

135
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,900
And Grace awakens.

136
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,710
It's sort of like when Barry woke me up

137
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,910
when the Thinker trapped me.

138
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,600
Surprisingly, that sounds kind of easy peasy.

139
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,140
As long as Grace's unusual brain damage

140
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,570
doesn't cause any unforeseen risks.

141
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,490
This is why I suggest you travel in pairs

142
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,690
when you're using this technology.

143
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,310
Every time I enter into someone's memories

144
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,710
when I use this I went with my partner for sure.

145
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,150
Your partner's name didn't happen to be Watson, did it?

146
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,710
No, his name was not Watson.

147
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,220
His name was Watsune.

148
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,980
Yes, together we went through dozens of minds, together--

149
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,620
until one time I found myself

150
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,560
in a memory of a motel room in Montreal

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,870
where what do I find but Watsune in flagrante deli

152
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,950
in interpersonal relationship with my wife,

153
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,990
fourth wife, but still.

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,520
You're saying you could see your partner's memories?

155
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,740
It's a possible side effect of traveling in pairs.

156
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,900
And speaking of which,

157
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,570
which pairs would like to volunteer for this mission?

158
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,940
I suggest the speedsters for this to be accomplished so quick.

159
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,210
- Yeah. - Elected.

160
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,880
Hey, if you see a memory of me stealing blank Scrabble tile

161
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,550
it's not what it looks like, all right?

162
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,800
That's a good one, Dad.

163
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,490
All that is left is to connect this transceiver disc

164
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,560
to Grace's EEG and we can transmit.

165
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,670
- Great. - Right.

166
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,820
All right, first thing tomorrow,

167
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,130
we save Grace.

168
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,300
Any big plans for the night off?

169
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm gonna crash.

170
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,540
Killer Frost was up all night watching movies

171
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,290
from her two favorite Johns, Woo and Hughes.

172
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,440
Huh, I'm more of a Ford and Waters man myself,

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,750
but I will be up all night yet again

174
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,530
working with the radiated meta-human sample you guys got me.

175
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,300
There's something missing with this cure.

176
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,490
All right, I'll see you guys later.

177
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,740
- All right. - Night.

178
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,920
You know, there's something that I'm missing too.

179
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,310
- Your freshly healed hands. - Odd choice of words.

180
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,120
Well, I'm meeting with an informant tonight

181
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,170
and he might have a lead on Dwyer's location,

182
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,320
but I'm not sure if I should trust him.

183
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,670
So you need me to vibe him. Look, man.

184
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,050
I should really be working on this cure.

185
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,850
But my splicer algorithm won't technically be done

186
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,860
until 3:00 A.M.

187
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,750
Thanks, man, this is, this is really important work.

188
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay.

189
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,670
Okay, Gideon, how do I hack this thing

190
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,620
so that Dad won't see my memories?

191
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,820
In any configuration,

192
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,630
if you and Barry Allen go in together,

193
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,880
you still risk exposing your memories.

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,450
So I can't do anything.

195
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,110
Gideon, is that...

196
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
Grace Gibbons' brain waves.

197
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,660
It would appear Sherloque Wells has planted the transceiver disc.

198
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,340
So I can go in alone.

199
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,950
And I'll be back before anyone notices,

200
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,180
but by that time Grace'll be awake anyway.

201
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,810
Activating brain wave transmission.

202
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,480
In three, two, one.

203
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,940
CCPD?

204
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,490
Okay, Jones, here's the kid.

205
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,970
We found her in the car hiding under the seat.

206
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,120
Her parents were at the ATM when the meta attacked.

207
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,460
Damn. We located her next of kin?

208
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,370
Maybe an uncle. Still tracking down

209
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,670
his last known address.

210
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,970
Well, she can't sleep on this bench.

211
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,480
We've gotta get her out of here.

212
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,200
God, poor kid.

213
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,080
Who are you? You can see me?

214
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,280
Oh, right, you're Grace's consciousness

215
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,270
in her old memory.

216
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,010
I'm Nora.

217
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,560
Can you take me to my parents?

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,410
No, um, I can't,

219
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,520
but if you come with me, I can help you feel better.

220
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,990
You know,

221
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,300
when I was your age, I had a friend just like this.

222
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,970
I bet he'd like to feel better too.

223
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay.

224
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,230
All right, Gracie, let's get you through

225
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,170
this portal and out of your coma

226
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,700
before anyone notices I snuck in here.

227
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,860
Oh, no.

228
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

229
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,170
Oh, no.

230
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,790
I'm trapped.

231
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,030
We're gonna find a way out of here, I promise.

232
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,220
I feel like I've been in this police station for a long time,

233
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,510
and now I'm gonna be here forever, aren't I?

234
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,630
Just leave me alone.

235
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,560
You know, when I was your age,

236
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,200
I had to come to this very same police station

237
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,810
all by myself too.

238
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,340
- It's kind of scary in here. - I'm not scared.

239
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,930
Well, I was. I'm scared all the time.

240
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,960
In fact, once, there was this really bad guy

241
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,260
and he wanted to hurt a whole lot of people on a plane.

242
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,330
A meta?

243
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,190
But I helped stop him.

244
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,930
- Whoa, really? - I was terrified, though.

245
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,750
But you know what my secret is?

246
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,770
I just imagine what will happen after I do the thing.

247
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,300
Do you want to try it?

248
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,680
Okay, close your eyes,

249
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,400
and think about what will happen once you're out of here.

250
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,510
I'll see Uncle Orlin.

251
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,720
Let's find our way out of here, okay?

252
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,990
So I can't use "Gazette"? "Chronicle"?

253
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,670
So the only name that's cleared is "Central City Citizen."

254
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,360
Uh, yeah, yeah, thanks.

255
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,450
Hey, who was that on the phone?

256
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,320
Um, a lawyer, she was helping answer some questions

257
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,820
about me starting a newspaper.

258
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,580
That's cool. What'd she say?

259
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,700
You know, it doesn't matter.

260
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,990
I-I'm actually not sure that the timing is right,

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,120
and I really just want to focus on team Flash

262
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,730
and stopping Cicada.

263
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,020
Yeah, but--

264
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,400
Oh, hold on.

265
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,460
Slow down, slow down.

266
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,470
It's Sherloque.

267
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,010
Nora did what?

268
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,150
Why would Nora go in alone?

269
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,770
And why isn't she out yet?

270
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,950
My working theory is that Grace's unique brain damage

271
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,600
has caused her brain to act defensively,

272
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,180
so when it sensed an outside presence,

273
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,230
it moved all of its neural nexus pathways

274
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,430
to seal the exits like a-a quarantine procedure.

275
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,460
Grace's brain thinks Nora's a pathogen.

276
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,280
Yes, we can expect its synaptic defense mechanisms

277
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,030
to try and eliminate her.

278
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,690
Remember I told you about the Mad Hatter?

279
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,620
He was also brain damaged, so after my dispute with

280
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,160
Watsune and my fourth wife, Watsune pursued the case

281
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,450
on his own until the day I found him

282
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,190
hooked up to the Machine ¨¤ M¨¦moire brain-dead.

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,620
You knew this was a possibility?

284
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,080
What happened to easy peasy?

285
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,790
That's why I say go in in pairs.

286
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,580
Barry, we have to go in after her.

287
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,340
I looked all over CCPD.

288
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,100
There's no sign of the portal.

289
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,760
How could you have looked everywhere?

290
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,900
You were gone for about two seconds.

291
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,600
Well, I'm really fast.

292
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,140
I-I used to run track in high school.

293
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,310
Go CC Squirrels.

294
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,480
Look, Grace, is there anywhere else you can take me?

295
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,810
Another memory?

296
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,080
Where are we?

297
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,580
My house.

298
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,490
Uncle Orlin!

299
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,840
Hey, kiddo.

300
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,900
How you doing? How was your day?

301
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,750
Let me run through this again.

302
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:48,180
So Mr. Truck, you said. You've seen Cicada here?

303
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,790
Dude's been up in here like a mean fungus.

304
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,820
I see, and how is the White Russian Hacker?

305
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,990
You wanna focus up here?

306
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,300
So can you tell me was he violent?

307
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,610
Hell yeah, every Thursday,

308
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,850
comes in and assaults anyone in here

309
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,080
Unnecessary.

310
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,580
But okay.

312
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,250
You're talking about a band named "Sickada"?

313
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,340
Yeah, bro.

314
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,550
You said "That dude" assaulted people.

315
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,970
He assaults everyone in here with that terrible music.

316
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,770
Dibs.

317
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,510
Well, that didn't pan out the way that I hoped.

318
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,390
We will have two Mother-In-Laws, please.

319
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,830
No, no, no, no. Truck, thank you for your time.

320
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,330
- I think we're done here. - One drink.

321
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,540
I'm paying.

322
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,840
One drink, but only because

323
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,420
you never pay for anything ever and I'm really curious

324
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,830
to see what hell looks like frozen over.

325
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,810
We can't warn her we're coming?

326
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,010
We wanted to install an emergency beacon,

327
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,090
but it didn't work.

328
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,570
So once you enter, it'll create a new portal.

329
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,380
You'll only have a few moments to find Grace and Nora

330
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,020
before Grace's brain tries to seal it off.

331
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,100
Remember, if you die in there...

332
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,320
We die out here. I remember from DeVoe.

333
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,120
We're gonna save her, I promise.

334
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,940
Commencing brainwave transmission.

335
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,710
Good luck.

336
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,750
CCPD.

337
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,060
All right, come on.

338
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,730
We found her hiding in the last car under the seat.

339
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,460
- And her parents? - No idea.

340
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,480
She was on the Red Line headed downtown.

341
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
Must've jumped the turnstile at Fourth and Waid.

342
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,570
We can't just let her sleep on this bench.

343
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,600
Oh, my God. Barry.

344
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,580
Wait, is that Joe West's granddaughter?

345
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,530
Nora? Hey, Nora.

346
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,730
Someone get her.

347
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,050
I don't think we're in Grace's memories.

348
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,360
We're in Nora's.

349
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,230
There's been no changes in Grace's brain activity.

350
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,490
But look.

351
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,490
Nora's brain activity has tripled.

352
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,600
That means...

353
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,670
Barry and Iris are in Nora's memories.

354
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,280
How did we end up in Nora's childhood memories?

355
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,090
I have no idea. I also have no clue

356
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,300
how we're gonna rescue Nora from here.

357
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,820
Okay. Okay, we're in a memory within a memory, right?

358
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,320
Yeah.

359
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,340
So if we went through a portal, then...

360
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,990
It should take us into Grace.

361
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,050
Okay, yeah, we just have to wander through Nora's memories

362
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,040
until we find where the portal went.

363
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,240
Okay.

364
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,880
Maybe she'll lead us right there.

365
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,860
What happened here?

366
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,170
I guess in Nora's future, S.T.A.R. Labs is--

367
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,470
- The Flash Museum. - The Flash Museum.

368
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,680
No way.

369
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,740
Look at this.

370
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,140
Flash toys and Flash phones.

371
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,910
Flash rings. Are you kidding? Wow.

372
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,770
This is all gonna go to your head, isn't it?

373
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,600
Oh, you know what? It looks like it might.

374
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,830
Oh, that is very cute.

375
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,820
Hey, I found her.

376
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,180
You think we can talk to her?

377
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,930
No. I wish.

378
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,090
This might be the only time I get to see her at this age.

379
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,260
Nora's consciousness isn't here, though.

380
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,750
It's in Grace. This is a fixed memory.

381
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,300
We can't interfere.

382
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,850
When I was ten, I wasn't running away from home.

383
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,210
That's 'cause you were a good kid.

384
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,390
I ran away all the time.

385
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,530
Yeah, only 'cause you were trying to see your dad.

386
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,520
Not 'cause you were running from someone.

387
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,530
Oh, hey, we should keep trying to find the portal.

389
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,860
Come on, Gracie, no cussing.

390
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,190
Please, can we, please?

391
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,910
Okay, fine.

392
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,890
A rare, old bird is a pelican whose beak can hold more

393
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,060
than his belly can.

394
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,610
He can hold in his beak enough food for a week.

395
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,070
But I'm darned if I know how the hell he can.

396
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,800
Grace, I was thinking maybe we could go now

397
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,520
and look for the portal?

398
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,490
Is something burning?

399
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,120
Oh, crap.

400
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,560
I mean, crud.

401
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,780
He thinks he takes care of me now,

402
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,830
but I really take care of him.

403
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,370
Okay, kiddo, you better eat up.

404
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,860
We've got a big day.

405
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,570
This is...

406
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,900
First we're going to the zoo...

407
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,270
This is an interesting doll house.

408
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,400
We're gonna get ice cream, and then...

409
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,140
Can't forget the fair.

410
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,470
Fair?

411
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,810
Where you got hurt.

412
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,890
Grace, I-I think that's where the portal is.

413
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,770
Can you take me there?

414
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,560
To the last place that you remember?

415
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,730
Okay.

416
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,340
Hey, check her out.

417
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,530
She's right up your alley. You should buy her a drink.

418
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,380
Damn. Look at that hand stitching.

419
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,870
No, no, I did not come here to admire jackets.

420
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,530
I came here to vibe and inform.

421
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,370
Is it just me or are there a lot

422
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,880
of ladies in leather in here?

423
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,580
Yep, singles night.

424
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,770
- It's quite a coincidence. - Is it?

425
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,520
What is it you're always saying?

426
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,350
- "I smell a mystery"? - That is trademarked.

427
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,050
I can vibe the anxiety coming off of you right now.

428
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,100
This whole thing was a setup.

429
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,810
Of course your informant didn't know Cicada.

430
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,590
I mean, he knew of Cicada.

431
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,410
You lied to me, you wasted my time

432
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,350
so I could be your wingman tonight?

433
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,960
No, no, no, dude, it's not like that.

434
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,600
You know, just when I think you're growing up,

435
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,280
you go ahead and do something that shows me

436
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,570
you're just as selfish as the day we met.

437
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,890
That's for the drinks.

438
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,280
Excuse me.

440
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,270
Wait.

441
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,930
These guys get their own wing?

442
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,190
Who is Cicada? Officials believe...

443
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,200
Barry, maybe we should keep looking for the portal.

444
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,290
Yeah.

445
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,890
But when Cicada resurfaced in 2024 after the Flash vanished,

446
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:59,220
some were left to speculate that Cicada is not a man at all,

447
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,320
but an immortal monster.

448
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,400
All we know for sure is his body count,

449
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,590
152 victims and rising.

450
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
Wait, what?

451
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,490
I knew we never caught Cicada, but he never stops killing?

452
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,520
Flash did everything he could,

453
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,340
but Cicada killed more people than Zoom

454
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,150
or even the Red Death.

455
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,940
And the way the city saw the Flash, his legacy...

456
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,690
it was never the same.

457
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,270
Nora West-Allen, you are in serious trouble, young lady.

458
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,280
Grace, what are we doing here?

459
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,060
You wanted to go to my last memory.

460
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,460
Yeah, but I thought that was supposed to be at the fair.

461
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,380
Grace?

462
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,750
Hello?

463
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,540
The destructive phenomenon emanated from a satellite

464
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,880
that had fallen into a decaying orbit.

465
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,180
Thankfully, before the satellite could strike the city...

466
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,720
How does she remember this?

467
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,480
A catastrophic event...

468
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,270
A new meta was last seen jumping off a building

470
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,530
in order to evade capture after...

471
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,970
I'm gonna make this right, Gracie.

472
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:17,000
Every meta will die.

473
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,620
Grace, how did you hear Orlin that night?

474
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,660
- You were in a coma. - I know.

475
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,120
But I've been listening.

476
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,990
- You have to stop. - Not until I'm finished.

477
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,460
Did they come after you tonight?

478
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,110
I killed his partner, Vibe,

479
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,050
but there was a woman there too,

480
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,170
banged me up pretty bad.

481
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,340
She had speed.

482
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,330
I think she's the Flash's daughter.

483
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,650
Grace, I don't know what you think Orlin said--

484
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,890
You said you looked everywhere.

485
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,620
I get it now. You have speed.

486
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,480
You're her, aren't you?

487
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,500
You're the Flash's daughter.

488
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,180
You're the one who hurt my uncle.

489
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,970
Grace, I want to help you.

490
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,880
No, you don't. Uncle Orlin told me about you.

491
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,890
You and your dad are trying to hurt him.

492
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,260
Only because he's trying to hurt other people,

493
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,900
innocent people!

494
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:26,850
No, he only hurts metas,

495
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,080
like the one who killed my parents.

496
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,290
Like you! You're a meta and a liar!

497
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,130
All metas aren't bad.

498
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,070
My uncle is a hero. He protects people,

499
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,690
and I protect my uncle!

500
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,720
My speed's gone.

501
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,220
Did you think that you could run away

502
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,610
and I wouldn't figure out where you went?

503
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,950
It's my job to find out the truth. I'm a reporter.

504
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,130
You're always a reporter.

505
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,190
Why not be my mom for once?

506
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,790
Oh, yeah? How's this for being your mom?

507
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:09,270
You are never coming back to this place again. Let's go.

508
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,820
Excuse me, what is in your pocket?

509
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,150
- Hand that over right now. - It's not yours.

510
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,640
Well, it is now. There are consequences to your actions.

511
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,780
Hand it over.

512
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,540
I hate you.

513
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,750
Leave it. Let's go.

514
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,710
Iris, that wasn't you.

515
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,970
Yeah, but it will be, Barry.

516
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,870
Nora's gonna grow up hating her mother.

517
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,080
No, she won't. You're gonna make different choices.

518
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,780
If you don't wanna be that person that we just saw,

519
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,270
don't be that person.

520
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,730
I know. I know you keep saying that, Barry,

521
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,100
and that's what I'm trying to do.

522
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,210
I had a moment today and I thought that

523
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,110
maybe if I could change the timeline now,

524
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,030
that even in the smallest way

525
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,520
that--I don't know.

526
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,850
That everything in the future would be somehow different.

527
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,400
This is why you changed your mind about the newspaper.

528
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,510
When I talked to the lawyer,

529
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,300
I asked her to check a dozen potential names,

530
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,650
and guess which one was the only one that cleared.

531
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,340
The "Central City Citizen."

532
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,660
I know it's got baggage, but it's just a name.

533
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,390
Is it? I mean, we've been looking at that front page

534
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,640
for four years.

535
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,440
"Flash Missing, Vanishes in Crisis."

536
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,140
And I'm the one that writes that article, Barry.

537
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,570
I just thought that, I don't know,

538
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,300
maybe if I don't start the paper, that--

539
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,740
Iris, this is your dream,

540
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,690
and the city needs somebody like you.

541
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,460
Yeah, but, Barry, look where it gets us.

542
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,500
These are Nora's memories right now in this timeline

543
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,210
after she interfered.

544
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,590
Let's keep looking for the portal, okay?

545
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,900
Nora needs our help.

546
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,040
I'll have whatever he's having.

547
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,300
All I want to order right now is a Lyft out of here,

548
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,010
but I get no bars in this bar,

549
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,440
so maybe I'll just have to leave the old-fashioned way

550
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,660
and breach on out of here.

551
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,790
Look, Cisco, I'm...

552
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,850
Sorry I lied to you.

553
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,370
Don't apologize to me.

554
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,080
Apologize to all the meta-humans out there

555
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,710
still waiting for a cure,

556
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,660
for their right to choose if they want these powers or not.

557
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,690
Before I was The Elongated Man,

558
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,150
when I was just nobody Ralph Dibny,

559
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,000
I could do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted,

560
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,350
but I didn't have any friends to do those things with.

561
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,720
So I just thought if, uh, we're getting a night off

562
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,820
from stopping Cicada, we could just

563
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,530
go out and...

564
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,420
have some fun, you know?

565
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,840
And I want that too,

566
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,550
but after we figure out this cure.

567
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,810
You know, my mom's friend Doug,

568
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,950
he had a saying.

569
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,340
"If you're always waiting to live your life,

570
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,970
you're gonna die before it starts."

571
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,200
And Doug, he would know.

572
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,060
He operated a zamboni.

573
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,100
May he rest in peace.

574
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,160
All right, I'ma go outside,

575
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,410
see if I can stretch my arm high enough

576
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:17,280
to get you some cell phone service.

577
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,410
Dark and Stormy on the house.

578
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,680
Do I look that pathetic?

579
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,340
You look like you belong here about as much as I do.

580
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,540
Thought I was coming here for a business meeting.

581
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,670
What do you do, sell leather?

582
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,620
- Nope. - Tattoo artist.

583
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,020
- Mm-mm. - Gun for hire.

584
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,970
Trust me.

585
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,440
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

586
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,780
Well, I'm a photographer,

587
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,130
so it looks like we're both a little lost.

588
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,980
So what's your excuse?

589
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,440
Taking pictures hasn't made me rich, yet,

590
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,060
so I bartend to pay rent.

591
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,390
My sister hooked me up here.

592
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,020
Forgot to mention I'd be working in hell.

593
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,730
Sisters.

594
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,140
If I looked at the DNA of two siblings,

595
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:05,340
one who became a meta and one who didn't,

596
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:07,160
I would have a close enough genetic match

597
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,680
to isolate the part of the genome

598
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
that controls meta-genes.

599
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,850
I'm sorry, did I just say that out loud?

600
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,640
Yeah, you did.

601
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,530
I-I just--that--I--

602
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,290
- Cisco. - Camilla.

603
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,620
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

604
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,890
I can't find the portal anywhere.

605
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,630
I can't even get out of Nora's memories of this one day.

606
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,760
Barry, get down!

607
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,690
Nora's in trouble. Grace's defense mechanisms

609
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,100
must be attacking her.

610
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,940
She's not the only one who's in trouble.

611
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,620
We need to get them out of there now.

612
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,140
It's Nora's defense mechanism.

613
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,060
What am I supposed to do now?

614
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,170
Hello?

615
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,180
- Nora, is that you? - Caitlyn!

616
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,760
Yes, I told you the M.A.D. 2.0

617
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,260
could complete your emergency beacon.

618
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,410
Uh, Nora, your parents went into your memories.

619
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,870
Uh, let me conference them in.

620
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,570
Sorry, my parents went where?

621
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,810
- Iris West-Allan. - Mom? Dad?

622
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,690
Nora, are you okay?

623
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,550
So listen. We made an important discovery.

624
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,580
To get you out of there.

625
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,810
The portals are hidden in perception gaps.

626
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,090
Things that you remember the way you want them to be,

627
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,650
not the way they actually were.

628
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,120
'Cause you're in denial or your perception

629
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,680
was colored by anger or what have you.

630
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,230
So these defense mechanisms, they're composed of synapses.

631
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,810
If you can break down the synapses in the false memory,

632
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,410
that will reveal the real memory

633
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,340
and the synaptic jolt will expose the portal.

634
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,330
Okay, so--okay, well, how do we do that?

635
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,790
Well, uh, we'll have to call you back.

636
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,910
You're burning up.

637
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,510
Hello?

638
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,810
Perception gaps.

639
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,790
The dollhouse.

640
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,560
How do we know which memories weren't real?

641
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,550
Of course... Iris, it's the Hall of Villains.

642
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,530
You and Nora.

643
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,010
Barry, I still dampen Nora's power.

644
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,710
She still grows up hating me. This is my future.

645
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,230
No, no, it's not.

646
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,660
It's just a memory, one warped from the perspective

647
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,780
of a sad, angry, little kid that ran away from home.

648
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,990
Don't you get it? That person that we saw in there,

649
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,430
the bad mom that Nora told us about,

650
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,630
she doesn't even exist in any timeline.

651
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,900
I told you you had to be different in the future,

652
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,110
but I was wrong.

653
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,620
You don't have to change who you are.

654
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,950
You don't even have to change the name of your newspaper.

655
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,040
I know any future with you in it is gonna be a good one.

656
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,150
You just gotta believe that too.

657
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,320
What are you doing here?

658
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,520
Please, this memory isn't real.

659
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,170
Your uncle's house, I don't think it's really like this.

660
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Okay, better eat up, kiddo.

661
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,220
We got a big day--

662
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,940
Grace, get down!

663
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,500
I don't see the portal anywhere.

664
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,760
Barry, it's working!

665
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,210
Death. Failure.

666
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,920
Another broken family.

667
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,190
This is the legacy I gave you.

668
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,370
Nobody breaks up my family, you son of a bitch.

669
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,690
Oh, no.

670
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,100
You dropped your toy.

671
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,840
I just wanted to see the museum.

672
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,520
I know, honey, but you ran away.

673
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,580
I didn't know where you went.

674
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,120
I was afraid you could have gotten hurt.

675
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,670
You said that the museum reminded you of Dad

676
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,160
'cause Dad was the Flash's number one fan.

677
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,910
So I wanted to see it

678
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,010
'cause I love the Flash too.

679
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,600
It's not fair.

680
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,540
I know, honey. I know it's not fair.

681
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,890
I love you, Nora.

682
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,210
Your dad loved you too.

683
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,480
So, so much.

684
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,450
Come here, girl.

685
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,550
Come on. We gotta go.

686
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,430
Let's go get Nora.

687
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,460
Grace, I know you're afraid.

688
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,680
You think that you'll never be as happy as you were

689
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,250
that day with your uncle.

690
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,090
That's why you try to remember it as perfect,

691
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,980
but things can be that good, Grace.

692
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,070
You just have to wake up.

693
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,690
And then you and me and my parents,

694
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,690
we can all help your uncle together.

695
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,470
You're a liar.

696
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,230
Grace.

697
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,770
Maybe you don't have anyone who cares about you,

698
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,310
but I have someone who cares about me,

699
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,290
and I'm the only one who can help him.

700
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,060
Mom.

701
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,760
She's not coming.

702
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,870
- What? - Hurry!

703
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,770
Come on. Come on.

704
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,830
They're okay.

705
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,730
Neural oscillations are normal.

706
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,110
You three are perfectly healthy.

707
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,430
Oh, and we think we've figured out

708
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,040
how you two ended up in Nora's brain.

710
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,980
That is a satellite shard full of dark matter in Grace's head.

711
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,950
Mon dieu.

712
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:50,270
Sometimes surgeons leave a piece of shrapnel

713
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,850
in a patient's brain if it's too dangerous to remove,

714
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,000
and we think that the dark matter was seeping out

715
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,270
to create a barrier around her brain.

716
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,710
We can't go back in as long as it's there.

717
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,740
It's too dangerous.

718
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,000
Well, we need to find another way to stop Cicada.

719
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,990
I think I might be able to help with that.

720
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,120
It's the inside of Dwyer's house.

721
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,340
- Damn. - I mean, that's great.

722
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,010
But why did you go in without us? We had a plan.

723
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,570
No, I know, um...

724
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:24,780
You know, just with the machine being ready

725
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,910
and knowing that Cicada was still out there,

726
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,460
I guess I just... I got a little excessive.

727
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:33,160
It's not the only reason, though, right?

728
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,900
It was protecting her secret.

729
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,280
What secret is that?

730
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,290
Well, her feelings for her mother when she was a child.

731
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:54,180
Must be painful memories.

732
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,180
Is that correct, Nora?

733
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,070
Yeah, exactly.

734
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,430
Okay, um, let's get started on this lead.

735
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,460
Good job, Nora.

736
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,470
Thanks.

737
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,660
Monsieur Allen, just for my records of today's events,

738
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,740
what was the defense mechanism Nora was using?

739
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:24,590
It was one of the costumes from the museum.

740
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,810
What costume?

741
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,490
The Reverse Flash.

742
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,430
Surprise!

743
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,710
Happy first day in your new office.

744
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,180
You're so sweet.

745
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,840
So have you decided what you're gonna name the paper?

746
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,200
I don't know.

747
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,620
"Central City Citizen" has a certain ring to it.

748
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,140
- You sure? - Yeah, you were right.

749
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,690
Future isn't always what it seems.

750
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,540
We decide what it gets to be.

751
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,240
So, um, I just have to tell you one little thing.

752
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,580
See that ledger down there?

754
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,970
That's the year the paper was founded in my time.

755
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,350
2021.

756
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,550
That's two years from now.

758
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,170
You're changing the future already.

759
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,560
Hey, um, I gotta find Cisco,

760
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,580
but I'll see you guys later, all right?

761
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,510
Okay.

762
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,150
Let's head back.

763
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,590
- Mom? - Yeah?

764
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,880
Dad told me about the memory that you saw.

765
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,270
I know it wasn't real, Nora,

766
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,020
but it must have come from a very real place.

767
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,410
You must have been so angry with me to see me that way.

768
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,360
I was angry all the time.

769
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,140
Angry for not getting to have a dad,

770
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,840
angry 'cause nobody seemed to understand what I was feeling.

771
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,460
And it didn't matter what you did or said, Mom.

772
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,670
I was always gonna be angry at you...

773
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,010
because you were there.

774
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,280
You're going through a lot, Nora.

775
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,960
But so were you.

776
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,040
I mean, I thought you were trying to stop me from being me,

777
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,200
but you were trying to stop me from being Dad.

778
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,410
I mean, ending up like him.

779
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,640
You guys had a whole life together

780
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,490
and a child, and he vanished.

781
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:38,410
I-I can't imagine how hard that must have been for you.

782
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,410
And from that day, you...

783
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,360
you were protecting me.

784
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,290
I-I get that now.

785
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,980
So sorry for the way that I treated you,

786
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,640
both back then and now when I first got here.

787
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,880
You didn't deserve that.

788
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,390
Thank you.

789
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,870
You're an amazing woman, Nora West-Allen.

790
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,970
I will always love you,

791
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,870
past, present, and future.

792
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,130
I love you too, Mom.

793
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:19,860
It's hard to keep a secret, but it's a lot easier

794
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,730
when you're reminded why you're doing it.

795
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,850
- Ready? - Yeah.

796
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:26,270
I met someone who told me that she would do anything

797
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:28,050
to protect her family.

798
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:33,320
She helped me see that... so would I.

799
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,260
My parents can't know that you're helping me stop Cicada.

800
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,210
There's too much at risk.

801
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,720
And I'll do anything to protect them.

802
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,180
Even lie.

804
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,580
Liar.

805
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,950
Liar.

806
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,290
Liar. Liar.

807
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,750
Nora lied to me.

808
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,450
She'll pay.

809
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,290
They'll all pay.

810
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,990
Doug was right.

811
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,800
Going out there, doing the ice skating thing,

812
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,090
that was definitely the right thing to do.

813
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,220
Yeah, all Doug, may he rest in peace.

814
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,300
Let's pour one out for the guy.

816
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,760
Camilla? The bartender?

817
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,420
- Uh, excuse me. - Dude, nice.

818
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,560
- All right, all right. - Yeah.

819
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,240
Hey, did you guys make a breakthrough

820
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,540
with the meta-human cure?

821
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,880
We did. I managed to locate a pair of

822
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,380
meta-non-meta siblings,

823
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,500
so this cure, it's as good as done.

824
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,380
All right, good, because I've been thinking.

825
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,300
I want to use the cure on Cicada.
